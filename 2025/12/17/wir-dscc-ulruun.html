    Ulruun, a bald and beardless dwarf in a fancy tunic. He's smiling
    repugnantly.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’re fresh out of Sorcerer-Kings, but there are still a couple of randos to
read through.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Ulruun used to be a skilled gladiator who managed to survive the arenas of
Nibenay for many years, a rarity. He eventually won his freedom, not for his
victories, but as a reward for murdering someone for his patron.</p>

<p>The dwarf then proceeded to become a living example of the cycle of abuse as he
went on to become a slave auctioneer for House Shom, and to run his own slave
trading operation on the side. The money he earned from both activities made him
wealthy, and finally allowed to achieve the luxurious life of debauchery he so
envied in the people who had forced him to risk his life for entertainment.</p>

<p>His epithet, “the Repugnant”, is not someone people call him to his face, but it
still describes his demeanor very well. He always travels with plenty of
bodyguards in case a competitor or the “merchandise” decides to take a swipe at
him, and has been known to take shelter behind lines of chained prisoners and
other innocents when attacked. If pressed, he can still rely on his arena
skills - that walking stick is mostly for show.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Ulruun is a Level 8 Soldier with 89 HP. As a dwarf, he has a ground speed of 5,
+5 to saves against poison, low-light vision, and the same <strong>Stand the Ground</strong>
and <strong>Steady-Footed</strong> traits PCs get. These reduced forced movement inflicted on
him by 1 and allow him to roll a save to avoid falling prone.</p>

<p>Ulruun’s main weapon is a <strong>Dagger</strong> whose basic attacks damage and mark for a
turn, and which can be used in a <strong>Hamstring</strong> maneuver that deals the same
damage and causes the target to fall prone if they move more than half their
speed before the end of their next turn. If a marked enemy tries to shift away
from him, he can use Hamstring on them as an interrupt.</p>

<p>If his pursuers are too insistent he can surprise them with a <strong>Hurled Cane</strong>
(minor, ranged 5), which targets Reflex and on a hit knocks prone and
immobilizes for a turn. This is an encounter power, as he only has one cane on
him.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Ulruun prefers his obvious bodyguards to be very large and intimidating, so he
tends to recruit goliaths and muls to the role. He also has more discreet humans
and halfling guards hidden in nearby crowds when walking through the city. And
if there are any innocents on the map when a fight breaks out, he’ll use them as
cover as well.</p>

<p>Ulruun is, well, repugnant, though other than being a dwarf there’s probably not
much that’s unique about him. I think he’s meant to be a typical example of a
sleazy slave trader.</p>
