<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Yes, he named his city after himself.</p>

<p>Nibenay seems to be a very academically-minded Sorcerer-King, which is evident
in how his transformation seems to be the furthest along among the living ones,
but he’s also kinda lazy. For about two thousand years now, he’s been holed up
in his palace-temple complex of Naggaramakam enjoying a life of luxury and study
while his priesthood took care of all those boring “running the kingdom” tasks.</p>

<p>His priesthood are also his templars, which are all women and all his wives. So
this might explain why Dregoth outpaced him 1700 years ago - Nibenay still has
his vices.</p>

<p>Nibebay’s highest ranking templars are known as the High Consorts. There are
five of them, each in charge of one of the city-state’s temples. The Shadow
King’s inner circle is composed of these five, plus his personal arcane
assistants, his half-monster son Dhojakt, and a group of elite goliath
warriors. Only they can enter Naggaramakam and interact directly with their
king. And only they know what Nibenay’s true draconic form looks like - he
disguises himself as a human in his rare public appearances.</p>

<p>Things might have continued this way forever if it wasn’t for Kalak’s
assassination and the liberation of Tyr. This kind of lit a fire under Nibenay,
and he decided to end his isolation and take a more active hand in the ruling of
his domain. This has nearly all Nibenese nobles and a large number of
lower-ranking templars in a panic because they’ve been up to a lot of
self-enriching shenanigans that they were sure their king would never notice or
care about. There’s a lot of unpleasant purges in the city’s immediate future.</p>

<p>Still, Nibenay hasn’t completely abandoned his research. He seems to be
particularly interested in Athas’ distant past, and is rumored to be looking for
a way to “bring about a new Age”. That probably involves some sort of
large-scale environmental engineering, though it’s unlikely to be beneficial to
the inhabitants.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three different stat blocks here, which we’ll see in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="shadow-bride">Shadow Bride</h3>

<p>This is one of Nibenay’s lower-ranking templars. The city’s nobles tend to look
down on them and use them as pawns in their own schemes - the name “Shadow
Bride” is something of an insult. The brides resent them for this, and do
whatever dirty deeds they need in order to claw some wealth and influence for
themselves and climb the ranks of their organization.</p>

<p>This Shadow Bride is a Level 13 Soldier with 130 HP and Speed 6. She fights with
an <strong>Obsidian Short Sword</strong> in melee, and with <strong>Shadow Bolts</strong> at range that do
light cold+necrotic damage. She can inflict the <strong>Curse of the Shadow King</strong> an
adjacent enemy with a minor action. This marks the enemy until the end of the
encounter and makes it grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>Marked enemies within 6 squares who decide to ignore the mark can be targeted
with <strong>Nibenay’s Retribution</strong> as an interrupt - the bride teleports to a square
adjacent to the enemy and makes a very accurate attack vs. their Fortitude,
dealing fire+necrotic damage on a hit.</p>

<p>In her own turns the bride can also <strong>Demand Penitence</strong> (recharge 5+),
targetting up to two marked enemies in a Close Burst 5, dealing psychic damage,
pulling them 4 squares, and knocking them prone.</p>

<p>Yup, this is a Soldier Warlock. Not a combination you see every day. The
“eldritch blast” equivalent here is distinctly secondary. She wants to bring
enemies into melee range and keep them there.</p>

<h3 id="high-consort">High Consort</h3>

<p>One of the five highest ranked priestess-wives of Nibenay, part of his inner
circle. Just like the city’s nobles, they jockey for position amongst
themselves, constantly engaging in backstabbing and intrigue, though they <em>are</em>
loyal to their hubby and will fight at his side against meddling PCs who manage
to get that far. They will also fight to the end to protect their own
temples. In any other situation, they run away when the fight turns against
them.</p>

<p>High Consorts are Level 27 Artillery with 192 HP, Speed 6 and Low-Light
Vision. They fight with <strong>Obsidian Spears</strong> in melee and with <strong>Shadow Blasts</strong>
at range 20. These deal cold+necrotic damage.</p>

<p>Their special spell is <strong>Cage of Shadows</strong> (ranged 10), which deals heavy force
damage and immobilizes (save ends). It recharges when they’re bloodied. They can
also practice <strong>Arcane Defiling</strong> whenever they miss with this power or with a
Shadow Blast while allies are present within 2 squares of them. This is a free
action that inflicts 10 necrotic damage on each such ally, and lets the consort
reroll the attack.</p>

<p>If they get surrounded, consorts can use <strong>Nibenay’s Gift</strong> (recharge 5+) as a
minor action, dealing 15 cold+necrotic damage to each adjacent enemy,
teleporting 6 squares, and gaining concealment for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="nibenay-sorcerer-king">Nibenay, Sorcerer-King</h3>

<p>Nibenay in his true form is a Large Natural Humanoid, and a Level 29 Elite
Controller with 532 HP. He has ground and teleport speeds of 6 and Darkvision.</p>

<p>His <strong>Sorcerer King’s Guile</strong> is going to ruin the day of many a PC fighter, as
it makes him not provoke opportunity attacks from making ranged and area
attacks.</p>

<p>In melee, he fights with Reach 2 <strong>Dragon’s Talons</strong>, which damage and restrain
(save ends). At range, he uses the classic <strong>Ego Whip</strong> (range 10), which deals
psychic damage and dazes (save ends). Yes, it’s at-will, and <strong>Ego Storm</strong> lets
him use it twice in the same action.</p>

<p>Less often, he can use <strong>Defiling Burst</strong> (recharge 5+), which automatically
deals 15 necrotic damage to each adjacent enemy and lets Nibenay attack an Area
Burst 2 within 10 to deal necrotic damage.</p>

<p>The text is a bit strange here, as it says Nibenay gains +1 to the burst’s
attack roll for each enemy damaged by it. I guess you roll once, count the hits,
add the bonus, and keep repeating the last two steps until he either runs out of
targets or misses someone.</p>

<p>As a minor action he can creaze a <strong>Zone of Shadows</strong> that lasts for a turn and
blocks line of sight for everyone except himself. Enemies inside are
blinded. The power recharges when the zone vanishes.</p>

<p>His version of <strong>Arcane Defiling</strong> triggers when he hits and deals damage with
either of his basic attacks. It inflicts 10 necrotic damage on each enemy within
2 squares and weakens the target of the triggering attack for a turn. It’s a
<em>free action</em>, not a reaction or interrupt, so this happens every single time he
hits with Dragon Talon or Ego Whip.</p>

<p><strong>Nibenay’s Demand</strong> is his anti-stunlock power, a reaction that lets him
inflict 10 necrotic damage on an enemy within 5 squares and roll a save whenever
he’s subject to an effect a save can end.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Nibenay being an Elite instead of a Solo is not necessarily a sign that he’s
weak, but that the final fight against him will be a crowded affair. Any
surviving high consorts will surely be here, as will any other epic level
assistants and guards the GM wants to add to make the battle a worthy challenge.</p>

<p>Unlike Andropinis, Nibenay doesn’t have powers that boost or benefit from his
allies, but at least he doesn’t get in their way either - his area attack is
selective. The High Consorts, however, <em>are</em> likely to step on each others’ toes
because their version of Arcane Defiling targets allies instead of enemies.</p>
