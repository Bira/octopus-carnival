<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Hamanu is the Sorcerer-King of Urik. He looks like a big strong man, and is
known to be deeply invested in the success of his city-state. He spends the days
governing it and training with his soldiers, and the nights deep in arcane study
since he no longer has any need for sleep. For Hamanu is the Sorcerer-King who
most genuinely cares about his state and its people.</p>

<p>I’m sure there are some tech billionaires in today’s real world that would read
the above paragraph and think “this guy is goals”. And they would not change
their opinions if they learned that he’s also the most totalitarian of the
Sorcerer-Kings as well. The price for his “love” is constant supervision and
total submission.</p>

<p>Despite being a very classically-trained wizard, Hamanu loves physical combat
and is quite good at punching people to death. He’s managing his gradual
draconic transformation so that the signs remain subtle for as long as possible,
so most of the time they consist of golden eyes and slightly long teeth. When
wounded in combat, however, be transforms into a big lion-dragon-thing.</p>

<p>Urik templars live spartan lives, but do get to enjoy the perks of their
station, chief among which is the right to push the common people around.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get stats for Hamanu and for a typical templar.</p>

<h3 id="toil-templar">Toil Templar</h3>

<p>Unlike the templars we saw in previous entries, this isn’t a high-ranking
officer who spends their days next to their king’s throne. Instead, this one is
drawn from the <em>lowest</em> ranks of Urik’s templars, the one responsible for
managing its enslaved population. It’s a Level 14 Controller with 133 HP,
meaning the PCs are likely to tussle with them long before they ever come
face-to-face with Hamanu himself.</p>

<p>Toil Templars are armed with a whip and a rod, which is very thematic. The
<strong>whip</strong> is Reach 2 and its attacks damage and push the target 2 squares on a
hit. The rod is used as an implement for their spells: <strong>Eldritch Scourge</strong>
(ranged 5) deals force damage and knocks prone; <strong>Dazing Bolts</strong> (encounter,
ranged 10) deals lightning damage and dazes for a turn; and <strong>Sulfurous
Detonation</strong> (encounter; area 2 within 10) is a fancy name for a fireball that
leaves a stinky zone lasting a turn and dealing 5 poison damage to any enemy who
ends their turn inside.</p>

<h3 id="hamanu-sorcerer-king">Hamanu, Sorcerer-King</h3>

<p>The man himself is a Level 27 Solo Controller with 693 HP, Speed 6, and
Darkvision. He exhudes a <strong>Regal Presence</strong> (aura 2) which inflicts a -2 attack
penalty on any enemy who starts their turn inside. This lasts until the start of
the enemy’s next turn, so it remains for that long even when they leave the
aura.</p>

<p>Hamanu’s basic melee attack is done with his <strong>Mighty Fists</strong>, whose 6d6+14
damage is the envy of every 2e and 3e monk but is typical for a creature of his
level.</p>

<p>He also has a big selection of “classic”-feeling spells. <strong>Thunderous Command</strong>
is an at-will close blast 5 that deals thunder damage, pushes 3 squares, and
knocks prone. The next three are all big blasty encounter spells:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sulfuric Bolts</strong> (ranged 5) targets up to 5 enemies, deals fire damage, and
inflicts ongoing 10 fire+acid damage (save ends). Until the target saves,
any of the target’s allies that ends their turn next to it takes 10
acid+poison damage. Stinky!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Life Drain</strong> (close burst 5, enemies only) deals necrotic damage and
inflicts ongoing 15 necrotic damage. Every time a target takes that damage,
Hamanu gains 15 temp HP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hamanu’s Whisper</strong> (area 2 within 10, the fireball template) is an
“acidball” that deals immediate and ongoing acid damage (save ends). It leaves
a zone behind that inflicts a -4 penalty to saves on any enemy inside. This
lasts for a turn but Hamanu can sustain it with minor actions and move it
around with move actions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As a minor action he can use an <strong>Invasive Glare</strong> (ranged 5) that deals heavy
psychic damage and stuns (save ends). This recharges whenever Hamanu bloodies an
enemy or reduces an enemy to 0 HP.</p>

<p>If an adjacent enemy targets him with a melee attack, Hamanu can interpose a
<strong>Cerulean Shield</strong> spell as an interrupt, gaining 15 temporary HP just before
the attack is rolled. If someone manages to daze or stun him, he can use
<strong>Mental Fortress</strong> as an interrupt to roll an immediate save against the
effect, even if it would not normally allow one. On a success, the triggering
enemy takes 15 psychic damage and the effect never happens.</p>

<p>When bloodied, <strong>Lion of the Desert</strong> automatically triggers with no action
required. This pushes every enemy in a close burst 2 squares, and attacks their
Fortitude to knock them prone on a hit. And then Hamanu turns into the eponymous
beast, which is going to be a nice surprise to any PCs who thought he had spent
all of his tricks already. The Lion has its own stat block, below.</p>

<p>When the Lion form is reduced to 0 HP, Hamanu returns to his human form with the
same HP he had when he transformed into the Lion. When he reaches 0 HP, he uses
Lion of the Desert <em>again</em>, one last time.</p>

<h3 id="lion-of-the-desert">Lion of the Desert</h3>

<p>Hamanu’s beast-form is a big lion-dragon hybrid, probably created by hiding all
of his ugliest draconic mutations in one metaphysical place. It’s a Level 27
Solo Brute with only 125 HP because it’s a stage in the bigger fight against
Hamanu and not something that can appear independently. On the bright side, it
<em>cannot become bloodied</em>, even when reduced below half HP. It has a Speed of 8,
and retains Darkvision.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Claw</strong> that deals heavy physical damage, and
<strong>Double Claw</strong> lets him use it twice against different targets. It can also use
a Reach 2 <strong>Corrosive Bite</strong> that deals a little less damage but inflicts
ongoing 15 acid damage (save ends). <strong>Lion’s Fury</strong> is an encounter power that
lets him pull off an old-school claw/claw/bite attack sequence.</p>

<p>If an enemy misses the Lion with a melee attack, its <strong>Warding Tail</strong> slams them
as a reaction, damaging and pushing them 3 squares on a hit.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>As a character, Hamanu seems to be what you get when you leave most of your
settings at default, the very first picture that comes into your mind when you
read the general description of what a Sorcerer-King is. The surprises only
start when it’s time to actually fight him, because “muscle wizard” is probably
not the very first thing that comes to your mind, and neither is “lion-dragon
monster”.</p>

<p>In a fight, Hamanu will likely want to alpha strike as soon as possible, using
Hamanu’s Whisper and Sulfuric Bolts as soon as enough targets are in range and
then wading in to catch people in his aura and let them catch his hands. He will
sustain the zone from Hamanu’s Whisper and then use Invasive Glare on the PCs
that are inside it, too. Cerulean Shield and Mental Fortress give him plenty of
extra durability for these tactics. As he approaches his bloodied value, make
him look like he’s on the ropes and out of tricks, and then spring the Lion on
the PCs.</p>

<p>The book doesn’t specify whether the uses of Hamanu’s many encounter powers
should be tracked across his transformations. I’m guessing that the human form’s
spells <em>should</em> be, but Lion’s Fury should <em>not</em>, meaning it will be ready for a
second use when he transforms again.</p>
