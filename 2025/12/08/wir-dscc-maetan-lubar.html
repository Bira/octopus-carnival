<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Maetan is the current head of House Lubar, one of Urik’s wealthiest noble
houses. He’s been prepared for leadership since childhood, though his time came
much sooner than expected due to the untimely death of his parents.</p>

<p>The house makes its fortunes through commerce and through the ownership of many
profitable fields outside of Urik’s walls. The work on those is performed by
slaves, and their administration by junior house members. Senior leadership like
Maetan has loftier concerns.</p>

<p>Maetan, for example, is busy petitioning Hamanu for the opportunity to lead a
large army against the recently freed city of Tyr, as he has a story of success
against Urik’s smaller enemies and wishes to attain new heights of glory and
favor with the sorcerer-king.</p>

<p>This probably relates to the 2e Prism Pentad adventures, which saw the PCs take
part in a battle against Urik’s forces. If this happens in your 4e campaign,
Maetan will likely be at the head of those forces.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Maetan Lubar is a human, and a Level 16 Elite Controller with 302 HP. He fights
using a combination of the fencing skills and psychic powers taught to him from
a tender age.</p>

<p>The fencing is distinctly second fiddle here: just a basic <strong>Longsword</strong> attack
that does level-appropriate damage with no riders. Maetan wants to stay a bit
outside of melee range and use his many psychic abilities instead. He’s a
telepath, so all of his powers target Will.</p>

<p><strong>Serpent’s Kiss</strong> is a range 20 basic attack that targets up to 2 creatures,
deals psychic damage and makes the target grant combat advantage for a
turn. <strong>Insidious Worm</strong> is an at-will range 10 attack that can only be used
against targets granting him combat advantage; it deals psychic damage and
forces the target to make a melee basic attack against another target of
Maetan’s choice. His usual routine would involve alternating these two.</p>

<p><strong>Coils of Lubar</strong> is an area 1 within 10 attack that deals psychic damage and
restrains (save ends). It deals 10 psychic damage as an aftereffect of the
save. It recharges when he uses <strong>Psionic Augment</strong>, a power that triggers when
Maetan hits with one of his two ranged at-wills and further boosts their
damage. And this, in turn, recharges when he’s first bloodied.</p>

<p>His two final powers are <strong>Psionic Intrusion</strong>, a minor action ranged attack
that dominates on a hit (save ends). This recharges when he’s first
bloodied. And the <strong>Mind Fog</strong> encounter power, which triggers when he’s hit by
a melee attack, affects a Close Burst 3, deals psychic damage on a hit, and
forces the targets to treat him as invisible (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I guess this might be a typical example of an evil noble type. The book says
Maetan will always be accompanied by a sizable honor guard, and in a fight he
will try to use his powers to make things easier for those guards (all of them
are selective, so he has no risk of hitting his allies). It also says that
despite all of his psionic might, Maetan is still very proud and overconfident
of his sword skills, so he might end up letting a PC get too close to him
because of this.</p>
