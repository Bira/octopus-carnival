<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Kanks are giant, beetle-like hive insects. A wild hive will viciously attack
strangers and intruders, but they’re actually relatively easy to domesticate:
just start feeding them. After a while, the kanks will start seeing those who
bring them food as members of the hive.</p>

<p>Each hive has a queen that does little more than continuously lay eggs. The
larvae that hatch from these eggs can specialize in one of two ways:</p>

<p>Kank spitters are the hive’s workers. Their duty is to forage for any sort of
organic matter and process it into a nutritive nectar that is used to feed the
hive (and extracted to feed people). They can store the noxious byproducts of
this processing and spit them at intruders as a form of defense, hence their
name.</p>

<p>Kank soldiers are very straightforward: they’re big, they’re strong, they have
huge mandibles. Their duty is to protect spitters from threats. When properly
trained, they’re also extremely popular war mounts.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Kank queens are too immobile to get combat stats, but we do get stats for the
other two types. Both are Natural Beasts with a ground speed of 8 and Resist 5
Acid and Poison.</p>

<h3 id="kank-spitter">Kank Spitter</h3>

<p>Spitters are Small but not defenseless. They’re Level 2 Artillery with 30
HP. Their <strong>bites</strong> do a mix of untyped and acid damage. Their <strong>Kank Spit</strong> has
range 10. On a hit it does a little bit of physical damage, inflicts ongoing 5
acid damage, and slows (save ends). If the target was already slowed, it is
immobilized instead.</p>

<h3 id="kank-soldier">Kank Soldier</h3>

<p>These Large kanks are Level 4 Soldiers with 54 HP and the Mount tag. Their
<strong>bite</strong> is rather weak to start with, but it grabs on a hit. Once the soldier
has a grabbed victim, it can only bite that victim, but its bite attack gains +2
to attack and +10 to damage.</p>

<p>The soldier can instead choose to inject the victim with <strong>Kank Venom</strong>
(recharge 5+), an attack that targets Fortitude, slows, and deals ongoing 10
poison damage (save ends both). After the first saved throw, this worsens to
immobilized.</p>

<p>If serving as a mount, their benefit is <strong>Grabbed Advantage</strong>: this gives their
rider combat advantage against the kank’s grabbed victim.</p>

<p>Kank soldiers don’t have marking mechanics, but they don’t need them. They’ll
focus on a victim and try to keep it grabbed by their mandibles, using the venom
as a parting shot if they have reason to release the grab.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I keep hearing about kanks in other Dark Sun Let’s Reads, so it’s nice to
finally put a (bug) face to the name, so to speak. They feel more interesting to
me than crodlus, both because they’re beetles and because they have a use other
than “war mount” to their humanoid caretakers.</p>
