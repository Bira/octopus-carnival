<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Andropinis is the Sorcerer-King who rules the city of Balic. His official title
is Dictator, and his city has a lot of Greek and Roman elements as we saw in the
other thread.</p>

<p>Here, the book says that Balic is clean, orderly, and mostly run along
democratic lines. Its templars, called praetors here, are elected to their
posts. Andropinis himself has an excellent reputation among his population, and
encourages the region’s tradition of ancestral worship and primal magic,
resulting in a remarkably fertile kingdom by Athasian standards.</p>

<p>Of course, the reasons for all of this are quite selfish. Andropinis has
mystically tied himself to the land and its ancestral spirits, and he teaches
his disciples to do the same. He encourages his people to love the land and tend
to it using primal magic because it increases his own power and makes the area
ripe for defiling. And obviously there’s never going to be elections for
Dictator if he has anything to say about it.</p>

<p>His magical ties to the land form the basis of Andropinis’ power, and he also
seems to be pursuing a more traditional draconic ascension path as a
defiler. While he normally looks like a strong human in late middle age, when
angry his features take on a reptilian cast, with golden scales appearing here
and there.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Here we get stats for the man himself and some of the allies he is likely to
surround himself with. We’ll look at them in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="legionnaire-vestige">Legionnaire Vestige</h3>

<p>This is one of those spirits venerated as Balic’s civic heroes. Andropinis can
summon them and order them around. It’s a Medium Shadow Animate and a Level 21
Minion Soldier with a ground speed of 6, a Flight speed of 5, Darkvision, and
immunity to immobilization. Them being Animates instead of Humanoids makes me
think the average Balic citizen is being misled about their true nature.</p>

<p>Anyway, every vestige has a <strong>Guarded Creature</strong> chosen when they enter the
fight, usually their summoner or creator. They fight with <strong>Shade Spears</strong> that
deal a bit of damage and mark the target until the vestige is defeated or the
encounter ends, whichever comes first. Yes, they can have multiple marked
targets if they last long enough.</p>

<p>If a marked enemy attacks the vestige’s guarded creature, the vestige teleports
to space adjacent to their guarded creature as an interrupt, and grants the
guarded creature +4 to all defenses against the attack. If the attack misses,
the vestige drops to 0 HP. They’re jumping in front of the attack, essentially,
so they’ll want to mark as many enemies as possible to better defend their
charge.</p>

<h3 id="high-praetor">High Praetor</h3>

<p>An example of the highest-ranking templars of Balic, those chosen to stand by
their Dictator’s side. It’s a Level 22 Soldier with the Leader tag and 211
HP. Their ground speed is 7, and they have a teleport speed of 5.</p>

<p>They’re equipped like cliche Roman legionnaires, and their basic attack is a
<strong>short sword</strong> that deals increased damage on opportunity attacks. They can use
it in a <strong>Face Cut</strong> attack, which deals standard damage and dazes for a turn.</p>

<p>They attack at range with <strong>eldritch javelins</strong> that deal force damage and slow
(save ends). Once per encounter they can upgrade this to an <strong>Entrapping
Javelin</strong>, which deals extra force damage and immobilizes (save ends).</p>

<p>Their <strong>High Praetor Assault</strong> maneuver lets them throw an Eldritch Javelin and
then charge. This also summons a legionnaire vestige, and lets the praetor
determine its guarded creature.</p>

<p>The praetor’s soldierly skill is <strong>Prateor’s Mark</strong>, which lets them mark an
enemy within 20 squares for a turn with a minor action. Marked enemies grant
combat advantage when not adjacent to the praeto, and take 15 psychic damage if
they make an attack that doesn’t target the praetor. So unlike most soldier
monsters, high prateors want to be far away from enemies they mark.</p>

<h3 id="andropinis-sorcerer-king">Andropinis, Sorcerer-King</h3>

<p>The Dictator of Balic is a Level 25 Elite Controller (Leader) with 468 HP, a
ground speed of 8, a flight speed of 5, darkvision, and blindsight 2. The fact
that he’s an Elite instead of a Solo means he will have a <em>sizable</em> honor guard
made up of high praetors and epic-level mages when you fight him. The more
allies he has, the more dangerous he is, even beyond the usual encounter maths.</p>

<p>Andropinis’ ties to his city and the surrounding region manifest in several
ways. One of them is the <strong>Dictator’s Concord</strong>, an aura (10) that gives a +2
bonus to saves for all allies inside, and allows them to save against charm,
fear, and stunning effects even if they would not normally allow saves.</p>

<p>His <strong>Wound Pact</strong> lets him automatically deal psychic damage to anyone who
damages him while he is already bloodied.</p>

<p>His basic melee attack is with a <strong>Pact Dagger</strong>, which damages and knocks prone
on a hit. The first time Andropinis takes damage before the end of his next
turn, the target takes 10 damage and is slowed (save ends).</p>

<p>At range, he can use psychic powers to inflict <strong>Overwhelming Memories</strong> on a
target, dealing psychic damage and sliding them 3 squares.</p>

<p><strong>Aggression Pact</strong> lets him use one of the two basic attacks above <em>and</em> let
one ally he can see make a free basic attack. <strong>Land Pact</strong> attacks enemies in a
Close Burst 3, deals untyped damage, and slows (save ends). While any target is
slowed by the power, Andropinis has Regeneration 15. Land Pact also causes 4
Legionnaire Vestiges to appear in the area, with Andropinis as their guarded
creature. It recharges when he is first bloodied.</p>

<p>Andropinis can also use <strong>Transposition</strong> (move) to switch places with an
ally within 10 squares, and <strong>Dictator’s Authority</strong> (minor) to let an ally take
a whole standard action right then and there. This, fortunately, only recharges
when he’s first bloodied.</p>

<p>Finally, if Andropinis ever starts his turn without any allies within 10
squares, a legionnaire vestige automatically appears within 10 squares, with him
as the guarded creature.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Andropinis might outwardly seem to be one of the least bad sorcerer-kings, and a
good propspect for an alliance against his peers. Of course, Balic being
inspired by Greece and Rome means that it’s an enthusiastic practitioner of
slavery. Those nifty civil rights are for citizens, and then only if Andropinis
isn’t angry at them. And when the chips are down Andropinis would not hesitate
to drain his whole kingdom of life in order to protect himself.</p>
