    <p>What’s a Monster Theme? The concept was first introduced in Dungeon Master’s
Guide 2, and it’s a way to give a set of monsters a shared look and feel. This
involves changes to their mechanics and lore, but unlike monster <em>templates</em>
from the DMG 1, it doesn’t change their “quality”. Regulars remain regulars,
elites remain elites, and so on.</p>

<p>Monster themes end up being more flexible than templates, since the monster
creation rules are good enough to handle any level or quality changes by
themselves.</p>

<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-monster-theme">Anatomy of a Monster Theme</h2>

<p>Each theme has a fairly involved presentation. You get some explanation for the
lore attached to that theme and how it might modify a monster. Then a line about
skill changes that might apply, and finally a big list of powers.</p>

<p>Those powers are divided between Attack Powers and Utility Powers - you pick one
of each category to add to the monster’s stat block. Nothing else about its
basic stats changes, unlike with a template. If you want those to change, you
can use the standard monster creation and “editing” rules to change the
monster’s level or quality.</p>

<h2 id="our-first-theme-arena-bred-monster">Our First Theme: Arena Bred Monster</h2>

<p>Blood sport arenas are the most popular entertainment in all city states, and
monster fighting is one of its most popular modalities. It’s common to throw
recently captured wild animals into the ring, but a monster that was
specifically prepared for the spectacle is a much bigger draw. Animals are
specifically bred for the role; people receive special training. And both might
be further modified by magic or psionics, all in the service of providing a more
brutal and spectacular fight.</p>

<p>Monsters with this theme get a +2 to Intimidate and a +2 to either Athletics or
Acrobatics.</p>

<h3 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h3>

<p>Despite the name of this category, the powers here tend to avoid having specific
attack or damage figures, to better enable them to apply to monsters of any
level.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Berserk Passage</strong> (recharge 5+) lets a monster make two basic attacks and
shift half its speed at any moment in this sequence, passing through enemy
spaces. It usually goes on monsters that have been made mad with hunger and
pain before being dropped into the arena, though I supposed it could also be
used to represent an agile duelist humanoid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bleeding Attack</strong> is a triggered power that inficst 5/tier ongoing damage
(save ends) when the monster bloodies a target. It might represent serrated
weapons or claws. The book recommends making it (recharge 5+) for elites or
solos; by default, it’s at-will.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Brutal Flourish</strong> lets the monster make a free melee basic attack whenever
it bloodies or defeats an enemy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Death Burst</strong> means the monster has been rigged to explode! This is visible
to the PCs and should be described appropriately. This power is common for
monsters that have received some sort of combat implant, but could be applied
even without that. By default this happens when the monster hits 0 HP, but for
elites and solos it could also happen when the monster is first bloodied,
where it might be combined with some other change in its stats as those
implanted bits fall off. The explosion is a Close Burst 2 with attack and
damage figures appropriate to the monster’s level.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Retaliating Stride</strong> (recharge 5+) is a move action that lets the monster
move its speed and deal damage to any creature that hits it with an
opportunity attack during this move. It can represent showy counterstrikes, or
maybe something like implanted spikes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Attached Weapons</strong> are not written up like a power, but discussed in general
terms inside a text box. Many arena monster handlers like to implant extra
weapons on their charges through magic. This is an excuse for your to add
extra attack powers that monsters of that type don’t normally have. For
example, an artillery monster could receive implanted melee weapons that give
it a stronger than usual melee attack, or a brute could get an unusually
accurate ranged weapon. It’s common for these weapons to break or fall off
when the monster is bloodied - and this can also be combined with Death Burst
variants.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h3>

<p>These are generally the fruit of long experience in the arena, representing
cunning, resilience, and luck.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Intervening Armor</strong> represents an ability to leverage the normally useless
piecemeal armor that covers gladiators by shifting so enemy attacks hit the
tiny plates. It’s an Interrupt that gives +2 to AC or Reflex when the monster
is hit by an attack targetting one of these defenses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Necessary Betrayal</strong> is for treacherous gits who developed the habit of
abusing their teammates’ trust. If the monster is hit by a melee or ranged
attack while adjacent to an ally, it can swap places with the ally as an
interrupt, and have the ally take damage from the attack instead. You don’t
compare the attack roll against the ally’s defenses - just apply the damage
directly. This power cannot be nice even by accident.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shake it Off</strong> represents the ability to quickly recover one’s wits in a
bout. Whenever subject to an effect that a save could possibly end, the
monster can roll a save to end it as a reaction, even if this specific
application cannot be ended with a save. (So it works against “dazed until the
end of the next turn”, but not against “dead”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Turn the Tables</strong> is a defense against forced movement. If pushed, pulled,
slid, or knocked prone, the creature can trigger this reaction to stand up (if
prone) and shift 2 squares.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think it’s interesting how many of the powers here can be either applied to a
berserk beast of a flashy humanoid fighter that uses finesse and agility, with
the final mechanical result being the same.</p>
