    <p>Continuing our read of the Hazards section, we’ll now see a few Wilderness
hazards. These are all naturally occurring, and most are extra-dangerous
versions of the terrain we saw earlier.</p>

<h2 id="wilderness-hazards">Wilderness Hazards</h2>

<h3 id="chokedust-cloud-level-2-lurker">Chokedust Cloud (Level 2 Lurker)</h3>

<p>A more dangerous version of the stuff you might find in ash wastes, silt pools,
and deserts with particularly fine sand. This is a 3-by-3 area of particularly
fine and powdery stuff, and the slightest disturbance will cause it to form a
cloud.</p>

<p>Characters can roll Perception to notice the area is different, and if they pass
that first test they can roll an easier Nature one to learn exactly why.</p>

<p>The hazard triggers when someone steps into the area, or when a portion of it is
included in a blast or burst attack. The entire area erupts into a choking cloud
that attacks the Fortitude of those standing on it. On a hit it blinds and
inflicts ongoing 5 damage (save ends). The cloud stays around after this -
victims cannot save against its effects while they remain inside. I imagine it
also attacks anyone who steps into it after this.</p>

<p>Characters can roll Acrobatics when moving into the area to avoid disturbing it,
and they can roll Endurance to steel themselves and gain a +2 to Fortitude
against the cloud’s next attack.</p>

<h3 id="badlands-tremor-level-5-lurker">Badlands Tremor (Level 5 Lurker)</h3>

<p>A small localized earthquake. It has four epicenter squares scattered through
the encounter area. The GM can either roll randomly or place them for maximum
inconvenience.</p>

<p>Characters can roll Perception to listen for the groaning noise that precedes
the tremor, and then Nature to identify it as an incoming earthquake and (with a
good enough roll) where the epicenters are.</p>

<p>The tremor starts when the encounter does - roll initiative for it. On its
initiative count, a random epicenter makes a Close Burst 5 attack vs. Reflex
that damages and knocks prone on a hit, half on a miss, and makes its area
difficult terrain.</p>

<p>The only countermeasure is an Acrobatics check on your turn to brace yourself
for the next tremor. Staying away from the tremor areas also works, but it might
not be feasible depending on the map’s layout.</p>

<h3 id="silt-sink-level-8-lurker">Silt Sink (Level 8 Lurker)</h3>

<p>A much more dangerous version of the Silt Pool terrain from before. This is a
4-by-4 squares wide, 30-foot deep hole filled with silt.</p>

<p>It takes a Perception roll to notice the ground is different, and then a Nature
check to realize this is a deep pit that could bury someone.</p>

<p>If someone steps onto the pit’s area, they suffer an attack against their
Reflex. On a hit they take fall damage (3d10, as if the pit was empty), and then
get immobilized and begin to take ongoing 5 damage until they escape.</p>

<p>An escape attempt requires a series of Athletics or Acrobatics check against the
pit’s escape DC. Each success causes the victm to rise 10 feet towards the
surface. If they’re still in the pit at the end of their turn, they remain
immobilized however. So it takes 3 successes for someone to fully escape.</p>

<p>Another character can try to help the victim if they can find a way to reach
them (such as with a long branch or pole), using a move action to automatically
pull them up by 10 feet.</p>

<h3 id="devil-dune-level-9-obstacle">Devil Dune (Level 9 Obstacle)</h3>

<p>A huge pile of loose sand that is currently being pushed by the winds and moving
at a surprisingly high speed. This could be a natural phenomenon, or it could be
the work of an angry spirit.</p>

<p>It can be automatically noticed, and there’s a Nature check to realize it’s
dangerous. The dune rolls Initiative, and on its turn it shifts 4 square towards
the nearest creature. When it enters a creature’s space, it can attack their
Reflex to try to engulf them. This damages, slows, inflicts ongoing 5 damage,
and obscures vision beyond 2 squares (save ends all). On a miss, it just slows
for a turn.</p>

<p>Someone who starts their turn entirely inside the dune takes an attack against
their Fortitude, which deals heavy damage and restrains. It takes an escape
roll, not a save, to get out of the sand.</p>

<p>The only countermeasure, other than staying the heck away, is the option to roll
Acrobatics as an interrupt before the dune attacks your Reflex. The result of
the roll becomes your new defense against that attack, even if it was lower than
your Reflex.</p>

<h3 id="false-oasis-level-13-elite-lurker">False Oasis (Level 13 Elite Lurker)</h3>

<p>This 6-by-6 square area looks like an oasis, but it’s actually an
illusion. Behind it is a 2-by-2 area filled with blood-sucking creeper plants,
which counts as blocking terrain. Sounds like just the kind of thing a group of
sand brides would set up.</p>

<p>An Insight check might let someone recognize the oasis as an illusion, but not
identify what it hides. A harder Arcana test can do both.</p>

<p>If someone gets to within 3 squares of the illusion’s borders, the hazard rolls
initiative. On its turn, the creepers reach out and try to pull the victim, an
attack against AC that deals no damage and pulls the target 2 squares. This can
target up to three creatures, so it not being an opportunity attack is actually
an advantage. There’s enough time for multiple victims to approach the sweet,
sweet illusion.</p>

<p>If a character starts their turn adjacent to the actual creeper squares, they’re
targetted by an opportunity action that attacks their Fortitude and, on a hit,
weakens and inflicts ongoing 10 necrotic damage (save ends). On a miss, it deals
5 necrotic damage.</p>

<p>If you can’t pierce the illusion or staying away is not an option, you can
destroy the false oasis with violence (105 HP, vulnerable 15 radiant).</p>

<h3 id="dust-funnel-level-15-blaster">Dust Funnel (Level 15 Blaster)</h3>

<p>A tornado, more or less.</p>

<p>Roll Initiative for the hazard when combat starts, and choose a square on the
battle map. On its first turn, the dust funnel manifests in a Close Burst 2
around that square, and takes up that much space.</p>

<p>A Perception or an easier Nature test can identify this spot as the forces build
up, before the funnel manifests.</p>

<p>On its turns, the funnel moves 1d10 squares and makes an attack against anyone
who happens to be in its area. On a hit, it damages, knocks prone, and
immobilizes its targets (save ends). Until the target passes a save, they get
dragged along with the funnel whenever it moves. Of course, targets who get
dragged along will suffer the attack again next turn, since they will be in
reach of it.</p>

<p>Imagine if this thing manages to grab <em>every other combatant</em>, monsters and PCs
alike. That’d be hilarious.</p>

<p>Characters can make a hard Nature check to figure out where the funnel will move
in its next turn, and if they can’t escape its path they can spend a standard
action to grab onto something and get +4 to all defenses against its next
attack.</p>

<h3 id="desert-glass-level-17-obstacle">Desert Glass (Level 17 Obstacle)</h3>

<p>We already saw what an even mix of sand and powdered glass can do. This is a
stretch of ground that’s mostly pure glass, in much bigger chunks. It’s super
slippery and cuts you to ribbons if you fall.</p>

<p>The hazard covers 20 contiguous squares, in any configuration the GM wants. All
of them are difficult terrain. If they’re not obvious, such as if there’s a
thin layer of sand over them, they can be identified with a Perception test.</p>

<p>Anyone who enters, starts their turn, or stands up from prone on one of these
squares takes an attack against Reflex that damages, knocks prone, and inflicts
ongoing 10 damage (save ends). It the target was already prone, they are dazed
for a turn instead.</p>

<p>If one or more squares of the glass are included in an area attack that has the
cold, thunder, or force keywords, the affected squares make a Close Burst 1
attack that deals the same amount of immediate and ongoing damage as the other
one, and then disappear. They got shattered and blew up.</p>

<h3 id="venomous-spines-level-21-blaster">Venomous Spines (Level 21 Blaster)</h3>

<p>These are from a species of tree that grows on some of the rare jungle biomes of
Athas. When someone gets near, the tree forcibly ejects an omni-directional
cloud of venomous spines.</p>

<p>A Perception check can notice there’s something funny about that tree. A Nature
check can identify it before the PCs enter its range.</p>

<p>The attack hits a Close Burst 5 around the tree, dealing heavy poison damage and
making a secondary attack that on a hit blinds and inflicts ongoing 5 poison
damage (save ends). On a miss, it deals half damage.</p>

<p>Someone who knows the tree is dangerous can close in without triggering it with
an Acrobatics or Stealth check. They can then use hard Nature checks to reduce
the size of the burst by 2 per successful check, entirely “disarming” the tree
with the third success. I’m guessing they’re plucking the spines.</p>

<h3 id="defiled-plain-level-24-obstacle">Defiled Plain (Level 24 Obstacle)</h3>

<p>A patch of ground so thoroughly defiled it’s not just dead, it’s
“undead”. Anyone stepping on it will have their life force drained.</p>

<p>A Perception check can tell the ground is unnatural, and an Arcana check can
identify its danger.</p>

<p>The attack deals heavy necrotic damage and inflicts vulnerable 10 to all damage
(save ends). The first failed save causes the target to lose a healing surge,
and the second one makes the vulnerability <em>permanent</em> until cured by a ritual
like Remove Affliction. A miss deals half damage.</p>

<p>A character near or on the affected area can make a hard Arcana check to
neutralize it for a turn. Characters without Arcane Defiling powers or abilities
have a +2 on this test. Those who have these take a -2 instead. A preserver
(which I assume means someone without those abilities) can choose to spend 2
healing surges to destroy the hazard, which I guess means they can restore some
of the place’s lost life. The book says those healing surges can only be
regained through an extended rest, which feels redundant but I guess means no
other trick that would normally allow an early recovery can do so.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These hazards are generally scarier versions of the terrain we saw earlier, so
they’re certainly appropriate for inclusion in battles taking place in that
terrain.</p>

<p>And that’s it for the book! I hope you enjoyed the reading. I’m trying to think
of what to do next, so any suggestions are welcome.</p>
