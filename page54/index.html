<p>At last we come to another iconic D&amp;D monster! If you’re following VoidDrifter’s
RPG.net thread on the Dragon Magazine monster articles, you can read about the
history of Death Knights in the game <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/lets-read-4e-dragon-dungeon-magazine-monster-articles.840167/post-22345155">here</a>. The article was published before
the Monster Manual came out, so here we finally get to see what 4e Death Knights
look like.</p>

<p>They exist in both the Monster Manual and the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Death Knights share some similarities with liches, in that they’re people who
became undead through a profane ritual so they could live forever. The main
difference here is that they were great warriors instead of potent
spellcasters. The ritual is also a bit different: instead of binding their soul
to a phylactery, it binds it to their favored weapon, which becomes known as
their Soul Weapon.</p>

<p>Death Knights retain the memories and abilities they had in life, but the ritual
distorts their personality into something much nastier than it used to be. Not
that they were all that nice to begin with, of course - becoming a Death Knight
is a choice and the ritual itself is an extremely evil act. Still, it’s common
for their to retain a twisted version of whatever code of honor they followed
before. Maybe a Death Knight will wax poetic about how it fell from grace while
it guts you.</p>

<p>You can expect them to always be superlative combatants and have great skill at
leading troops. Even nonsapient skeletons become more dangerous under the
command of a Death Knight.</p>

<p>If you manage to disarm them of their soul weapon, they become dazed and
weakened, though anyone else who holds the weapon suffers the same
effects. Destroying the weapon is useless - the knight can restore it with a
touch. There’s no shortcut to destroying a Death Knight: you have to defeat them
in combat. When they fall their soul weapons lose their special properties.</p>

<p>The ritual for turning someone into a death knight comes from Orcus
himself. The agents of Orcus seek out legendary warriors who are reaching the
end of their lives and tempt them with immortality. Others seek the ritual of
their own volition.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>“Death Knight” is actually a <em>monster template</em>, the first we’ve ran into
here. The way 4e templates work is that they make a regular monster Elite and
add a suite of thematic powers. You can technically add two templates together
to make a Solo as well, with a few modifications to the process.</p>

<p>The detailed rules for adding HP and defenses from the template to a monster are
a bit awkward. In practice, you’re better off making an Elite or Solo monster
from scratch with the traits from the templates you want. We get two example
Death Knights here, both of which have MM and MV versions.</p>

<h3 id="death-knight-human-fighter">Death Knight (Human Fighter)</h3>

<p>Called just a “Death Knight” by the Monster Vault, this dapper fellow is a Level
17 Elite Soldier. The MM version has 264 HP, but the MV one has 324. In both
cases it has darkvision, Resist 10 necrotic, and Vulnerable 10 Radiant, and
moves with Speed 5 due to its heavy armor.</p>

<p>Power-wise, there’s quite a bit of ground to cover, so we’ll list things in the
MV order, by action type.</p>

<p>The Death Knight has a passive trait called Marshal Undead, which gives any
undead allies of level 17 or less within 10 squares of the knight a +2 to all
attacks.</p>

<p>It attacks with its Soulsword, which in the MM does a mix of physical and
necrotic damage plus extra necrotic damage on a hit. In the MV, it does a whole
bunch of necrotic damage and marks the target for a turn even on a miss.</p>

<p>It can also use the sword to perform a Containing Strike, which is like the
basic attack above but allows the knight to make a free attack against the
target if they try to shift until the end of the next turn. The MM version is
single-target, the MV version can target 1 or 2 creatures, making this the
monster’s basic Elite multiattack ability.</p>

<p>Oncer per encounter it can use Warrior’s Challenge, which I believe is a Fighter
power. It does encounter-power-level damage, pushes the target 2 squares, and
marks every enemy within 2 squares of the target at the end of the push.</p>

<p>Finally, on a recharge 5-6, it can unleash Unholy Flames in a Close Burst 2,
which does a heap of necrotic damage to enemies and gives 2d6 extra fire damage
to the attacks of any undead allies for a turn.</p>

<p>The MM Death Knight also has a Second Wind it can use once per encounter to
recover 66 HP. So that’s why tie MM version has less HP!</p>

<p>The Death Knight can punish marked targets like a fighter.</p>

<p>The MV version has one other triggered action: Implacable, which lets it make an
immediate save against being marked, slowed, dazed, immobilized, or
stunned. This means all of those effects have only a 40% chance of actually
landing unless the party can try to apply them multiple times in a turn.</p>

<p>This monster works really well as the commander of an undead unit, and the
suggested encounter features just that: Level 16, a death knight, 2 abyssal
ghouls, and 2 sword wraiths. Perhaps these were the knight’s old subordinates,
made into undead servitors as part of the ritual that transformed it.</p>

<h3 id="death-knight-blackguard">Death Knight Blackguard</h3>

<p>This MV-only variant is a Level 18 Elite Skirmisher with 338 HP. It mainly shows
the advantage of dropping the somewhat rigid structure of templates and making
your own monsters from scratch using them as guidelines.</p>

<p>It has the same darkvision and resistances as the classic Death Knight above,
and exchanges Marshal Undead with Slayer of the Living, an Aura 3 that slides
any enemy who ends its turn in the aura 3 squares. A handy tool for drawing in
the squishies while keeping the defenders away.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is still the Soulsword, which here allows the knight to shift 2
squares before or after the attack instead of marking. It can use this attack
twice in a turn, against different enemies.</p>

<p>It can also choose to do an at-will Overpowering Attack against 1 or 2 enemies,
which slides <em>them</em> instead of shifting the knight.</p>

<p>The Blackguard possesses an Abyssal Blast encounter power that targets Reflex
and does a heap of fire and necrotic damage to enemies in a Close Burst 5, or
half damage on a miss.</p>

<p>As a minor action, it can use Chilling Glare to make one enemy within 5 squares
automatically grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>And finally, the Blackguard is just as Implacable as the MV Death Knight.</p>

<p>Yeah, keeping any sort of formation while one of these is on the field is a
hopeless endeavor. It becomes even more dangerous when paired with a classic
death knight and a few other lesser undead, preferably ones that do nasty things
if they get combat advantage, which it can give out freely.</p>

<h3 id="death-knight-dragonborn-paladin">Death Knight (Dragonborn Paladin)</h3>

<p>This MM-only variant is a Level 25 Elite Soldier with 373 HP (466 if you add the
Second Wind). It has darkvision, Resist 15 necrotic, and Vulnerable 15 radiant.</p>

<p>This Death Knight combines many of the powers of the classic model (which come
from the template) with a few paladin-like attacks. This means it has the same
Marhsal Undead aura and Unholy Flames burst. Being an MM-only monster it lacks
Implacable.</p>

<p>Aside from the basic soulsword attack, it can use the Valiant Strike at-will
power that gives it an extra +1 to the attack roll per adjacent enemy. It also
has a Terrifying Smite encounter power that does extra damage, pushes the target
5 squares and prevents it from moving closer to the knight for a turn.</p>

<p>Its mark power is the paladin’s Divine Challenge, which lasts until the knight
marks someone else and does a bit of automatic necrotic damage to targets that
flout the mark.</p>

<p>This death knight features in the second suggested encounter of the Monster
Manual entry, which is level 24 and has it accompanied by a fell wyvern, a great
flameskull and a bunch of abyssal ghoul minions. It’s something you can expect
when raiding Orcus’s neighborhood in the Abyss.</p>

<p>I can see why they fixed the paladin’s mark in Divine Power, and why they
dropped much of the fiddly bits for adding templates. Not having any multiattack
ability makes it a little less effective than an elite monster of its level
should be. The lack of Implacable is also keenly felt. This is a bit
disappointing since we’re probably looking at someone who had a direct hand in
the fall of Arkhosia.</p>

<p>Dark Ones are small humanoids from the Shadowfell, echoing the world’s halflings
in the same way Shadar-Kai (which we’ll eventually get to) echo its
humans. They’re halfling-sized with purplish skin, pronounced noses, pupiless
eyes and sharp teeth. I think the one pictured in the book also has hooves and
is wearing boots over them, which is somewhere between cute and funny. Overall,
though, the Shadowfell aesthetic is definitely there.</p>

<p>Since they’re Unaligned, I imagine there are entire communities of Dark One
civilians out there leading peaceful existences alongside Shadar-Kai villagers
and the like. Their culture probably bears a vague resemblance to that of
halflings but is much gloomier. This all speculation on my part, though, as the
book deals with the sort of Dark One PCs are likely to fight.</p>

<p>Dark Ones have at least as much talent for skulduggery as haflings, so the ones
PCs meet as antagonists will likely be up to something shady - espionage, theft,
assassination, and so on. They often work for shadar-kai, intelligent undead,
and Underdark dwellers. Even then you could still make them enigmatic spy types
that might ally with the PCs if their goals happen to match.</p>

<p>We have two varieties here, both Unaligned Small Shadow Humanoids with Speed 6
and darkvision. They’re trained in Stealth and Thievery.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dark Creeper</strong> is a Level 4 Skirmisher with 54 HP. It carries 5 daggers
hidden in its black garments, and uses them to attack both in melee and at
range. It deals extra damage against targets that grant it combat advantage, and
has a Dark Step at-will movement power that allows it to move up to 4 squares
while gaining a +4 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks, and to gain combat
advantage against anyone it ends up adjacent to.</p>

<p>It clearly fights by zipping around the battlefield as a cloud of shadowy smoke
and stabbing fools. It won’t avoid OAs every time, but will still avoid enough
to be a nuisance. When the Dark Creeper dies, it “explodes in a spout of
darkness”, automatically blinding anyone (save ends) in a close burst 1.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dark Stalker</strong> is a Level 10 Lurker with 81 HP. It wears the same black
garments and also carries a bunch of daggers, but prefers a scimitar for
close-in work. It has the same abilities as the Dark Creeper, plus a few extras:</p>

<p>Dark Fog is an encounter power that creates a zone of darkens in an Area Burst 4
within 10 squares of the stalker. This zone lasts a turn but can be sustained
with a minor action. It blocks line of sight for anyone who doesn’t have
darkvision.</p>

<p>Finally, the dark stalker can become invisible for a turn with a minor action, a
power which recharges on a 3-6.</p>

<p>While the Dark Stalker can use Dark Fog and Invisibility to hide a better than
the Dark Creeper, the fact that it has stronger versions of all the creeper’s
powers strongly indicates to me it should be a skirmisher, and not a
lurker. This would make it a better able to survive the thick of the action.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 4: 3 dark creepers, 2 shadowunter bats, and 1
deathlock wight. I would strongly suggesting giving the creeper trio the ability
to drop a single zone of darkness like the stalker’s as a joint stunt. That
would give both the bats and the creepers some extra kick.</p>

<p>I like these! Their lore is kinda sparse but suggests several interesting plot
hooks. The signature traits for making custom dark ones are their Small size,
the Killing Dark power that makes them explode into ink, and Dark Step. It’s
easy to make either these existing dark ones or your custom models of a leve
that makes them likely to hang out with shadar-kai.</p>

<p>Argle wants no trouble. Even when town people try to give him trouble. Lives
deep in the forest. Hunts his food. Sells pelts in town, once in a while. Is
friend to small children. Small children have not learned to fear Argle
yet.</p>

<p>One day, strangers disturb Argle’s peace. Think he’s an evil wizard. Much
explaining happens before they realize Argle only have similar name to evil
wizard.</p>

<p>Strangers depart. Days later, Argle departs too. Finds some friends, which is
good. Goes questing with friends. Maybe someday he find evil wizard and kill him
to stop people from confusing Argle with him. Also demons and stranger stuff.</p>

<p>Argle used 2 character points to buy extra gear. Likes to shoot enemies with his
bow. Will grapple and stab if can’t shoot. Will spend earned points on being
more shooty; might spend them on being better wrestler too.</p>

<p>Sakura was built centuries ago, by the despotic empire that ruled this region in
ancient times. She was a bodyguard to one of their high officials, but
eventually rebelled when she saw how much suffering the empire inflicted on its
population.</p>

<p>The warforged joined in the slave revolt that finally toppled the empire, and
fell in battle there. She was recently found and re-activated by a group of
delvers, and joined up with them to find out more about her strange new
surroundings - and to find a way to repair the extensive battle damage she still
bears.</p>

<p>Even though Sakura wasn’t conscious for all of those centuries of inactivity,
she still feels a terrible sense of loneliness, and prefers to stick close to
her newfound friends to keep that feeling away.</p>

<p>Mechanically, Sakura uses the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/17/dfrpg-warforged.html">Warforged</a> racial template and the Duelist
template from the “Swords Against Evil” article Pyramid #3/64. It’s a variant
Swashbuckler, so she is allowed to buy Swashbuckler power-ups with earned
points. Equipment is from the DFRPG boxed set.</p>

<p>Sakura is very well-positioned to benefit from the Martial Artist “multiclass”
lens from GURPS DF 3: The Next Level, though I can see her going towards Knight
or Holy Warrior instead. Other destinations from earned points include buying
off Wounded to represent fixing her battle damage, and of course more combat
abilities.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! You can find all of them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Both the Monster Manual and the Vault call them Cyclopses in the plural, but I’m
going to use Cyclopes and there’s nothing you can do about it.</p>

<p>Cyclopes are drawn from Greek myth. The most famous individual there is
Polyphemus, who tangles with Odysseus during his travels, but many others appear
in other myths, where they are often regarded as proficient craftsmen. Depending
on the story, these giants are either brothers to the Titans or demigods.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>All that stuff above is Greek myth, though. D&amp;D cyclopes don’t have divine
blood, and in 4e they get a whole new backstory.</p>

<p>Here, they’re Large Fey Humanoids native to the Feywild. Some theorize they’re
an “echo” of the world’s ogres, but if this is true they’re the platonic ideal
of their mundane counterparts in the same way the other fey monsters we saw
before are. These giants have robust builds, grey or light purple skin and
heavily ridged brows in addition to the infamous single large eye in the middle
of their foreheads.</p>

<p>Cyclops culture centers around loyalty and service. Once a cyclops has sworn
fealty to a lord, they will obey all of the lord’s orders regardless of how they
might feel about them. Only if their lord betrays them will they forsake this
service. The main reason PCs might come into conflict with cyclopes is because
the vast majority of them collectively sworn to serve the fomorians, the <em>other</em>
fey giants we’ll get to eventually. For now it suffices to say fomorians are bad
news all around. Fomorian magic is probably the reason why modern cyclopes are
one-eyed and sometimes have gaze attacks.</p>

<p>This swearing of allegiance happened at the dawn of time, and by now “cyclopes
serve fomorians” is a truism akin to “water is wet”. Should someone (like, say,
a group of PCs) ever convince the cyclopes to abandon their masters, it will
shake the pillars of the Feywild.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, cyclopes can also sometimes be found in cahoots with
drow. Rumor has it that this is due to an ancient treaty between fomorians and
drow called the “Declaration of Eschatos”, though no one knows its specifics.</p>

<p>Cyclopes also have a reputation for being master crafters that spans the
planes. They prefer to spend lots of time and effort perfecting a single
creation to doing any sort of mass production, so items of cyclops make are sure
to be both rare and powerful.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>In addition to the staggering amount of lore above, both books provide us with a
very large variery of cyclopes to work with. Enough that you could likely stock
a whole dungeon with only cyclopes and their fomorian masters.</p>

<h3 id="common-cyclops-traits">Common Cyclops Traits</h3>

<p>All cyclopes here are Large Fey Humanoids, Unaligned, and have Int scores
between 10 and 14 (with the spellcasters getting the higher numbers). They’re
all trained in Perception and have Truesight, means they can see invisible
creatures and objects. In the MM versions, the range of their truesight is
limited to 6 squares; in the MV, it has the same range as their sight. They run
with speed 8.</p>

<p>They also all have an Evil Eye ability that’s usually an at-will minor action,
though the effects vary with the specific type of cyclops. Lets look at them
individually.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-guard">Cyclops Guard</h3>

<p>This is a Level 14 Minion Brute, present in both books. The MV version is the
only cyclops to not have Truesight - the MM version has Truesight 6 like the
others in the same book.</p>

<p>Being minions, they’re rather simple: they have a battleaxe attack, and their
evil eye is a triggered action that allows them to make a basic attack against
someone who misses them in melee.</p>

<p>The MM also has the Cyclops Warrior, which is identical aside from being
level 16. A bit of a waste of page space, since leveling up monsters is so easy
in 4e.</p>

<p>Both minions wear hide armor, and carry battleaxes and shields.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-crusher">Cyclops Crusher</h3>

<p>A Level 14 Brute with 171 HP present only in the MV. It wears scale and attacks
with a spiked greatclub, and has a Tremor Smash that recharges on a 5-6, targets
everyone in a close blast 2, and does a lot of damage and knocks prone on a hit.</p>

<p>Its evil eye automatically gives a target a -2 penalty to all attacks and
defenses until the cyclops uses the power again or until the end of the
encounter, whichever comes first.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-impaler">Cyclops Impaler</h3>

<p>Level 14 Artillery with 111 HP, present only in the MM. It wears leather and
carries a sheaf of 12 spears on its back. The impaler attacks with those spears
both in melee and at range, and has a Spear Volley power that recharges on a 6
and allows it to make 2 more damaging spear attacks that also do ongoing damage.</p>

<p>Its evil eye gives it +2 to ranged attacks against the currently cursed
target. This is less effective than it seems because its basic spear toss
doesn’t have the usual accuracy bonus for artillery monsters, meaning the evil
eye only brings it up to par. When fixing this for use at the table, you should
give it the usual accuracy bonus to all ranged attacks and let the evil eye
apply on top of that.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-rambler">Cyclops Rambler</h3>

<p>The Level 14 Skirmisher variant with 141 HP, present in both books. The rambler
wears mail and wields a greatsword.</p>

<p>Its evil eye allows it to designate a target, and when adjacent to that target
the rambler can shift one extra square. When it hits the target with an attack,
it can use Feywild Alacrity (recharge 6) to immediately gain a free move.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual version has a Mocking Eye aura 10, that gives all enemies
inside a -5 penalty to target the rambler with opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault version trades this for Bounding Charge, an encounter power
that does high damage, half in a miss, and allows the rambler to shift up to 3
squares both before and after the attack.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-hewer">Cyclops Hewer</h3>

<p>The Level 16 Soldier version, with 158 HP, from both books. It wears mail and
fights with a battleaxe and a light shield. The main attraction here is the evil
eye ability: if its target attacks anyone other than the hewer, it gets to make
a free attack against them. And if the target moves away from the hewer, it can
immediately shift 1 square closer to it.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-battleweaver">Cyclops Battleweaver</h3>

<p>A Level 16 Skirmisher with 165 HP, present only in the monster manual. This one
wears mail and wields a glaive. Its evil eye reduces the target’s speed by 2,
and it can sweep with the glaive at will in a close burst 2 that pushes anyone
it hits 1 square and knocks them prone in addition to doing the same damage as a
basic attack.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, when the battleweaver suffers a “save ends” effect, it can
immediately transfer that effect to the current target of its evil eye, which is
a nice bit of unexpected nastiness.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-storm-shaman">Cyclops Storm Shaman</h3>

<p>Level 17 Artillery with 128 HP, from the MM only. The shaman wears leather and
carries a staff. Its basic staff attack does a mix of physical and thunder
damage; it has a basic ranged attack in the form of a Storm Orb that targets
Reflex and does lightning and thunder damage.</p>

<p>Its evil eye makes the target vulnerable (5) to both thunder and lightning
damage. This helps both its melee and ranged attacks, though a vulnerable target
hit by the Storm Orb will only take 5 extra damage and not 10, since the damage
type is “thunder and lightning”.</p>

<p>Once per encounter it can place a Storm Burst, an area 2 within 10
attack that creates a zone I imagine being a little angry storm cloud. Enemies
starting their turns in the zone are zapped for lightning damage, and the rain
automatically douses uncovered flames and ends ongoing fire damage.</p>

<p>Finally, as an encounter minor action, the storm shaman can gain a flight speed
of 8 for a turn. If it hasn’t landed when the flight ends, it will crash.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual suggests a whopping 4 encounters involving cyclopes. The most
common scenario is a fomorian accompanied by a cyclops security detail, but
there are some surprises here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: 4 cyclops guards, 2 drow warriors, 1 drow blademaster. The
Declaration of Eschatos in action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 2 cyclops battleweavers, 2 thunderfury boars, 1 fomorian warrior. I
can picture the cyclopes opening cage doors to release the <del>hounds</del> boars.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 1 cyclops storm shaman, 2 battleweavers and 1 chimera. Could these
be independent, or do the fomorians trust the shaman to go on away missions?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 2 cyclops hewers, 2 cyclops impalers, 1 fomorian painbringer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I really like the fey-tinged fluff for cyclops here, and their ties to
fomorians. It appears the authors have also managed to keep enough references to
the Greek myths to keep things flavorful (the cyclopes-as-master-crafters
thing).</p>

<p>Cyclopes feel to me like honorable and sympathetic foes the party will see
itself forced to fight in order to get at their evil masters. A fomorian-focused
adventure pretty much <em>has</em> to include a way for the party to turn the cyclopes
against the fomorians.</p>
