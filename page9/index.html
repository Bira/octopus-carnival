<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>One of the things we learned about the cosmology of Athas early in the Campaign
Setting reading is that its Shadowfell is locally known as the Gray, and it’s
suspected to block access to the Astral Sea and any other worlds beyond.</p>

<p>This becomes relevant here, because the people known as the Gith are said to
have arrived on Athas long ago, sailing from beyond the Gray in silvery
ships. Once here, however, they found out they couldn’t go back. To make matters
worse, these alien visitors found out that they were particularly susceptible to
the corruptive influences of Athasian arcane magic, which turned them Darker and
Sunnier over the generations.</p>

<p>Present-day gith are more monstrous in appearance than the ones you’re used
to. Their mindset is also more monstrous, which is saying something considering
these were probably githyanki invaders to start with. Despite the mutations
they’ve undergone, they retain their psychic abilities.</p>

<p>Gith organize in nomadic hunter communities, wandering through the moutains and
the Tablelands region. They make no particular distinction between standard
animals and sapient outsiders when it comes to chosing their prey, and think
both make fine eating. Some Gith groups are dedicated to gathering the scattered
parts of their original ships, hoping to reassemble them so they can get off
this rock.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gith are Medium Natural Humanoids with Speed 6. Their signature power is the
same as that of standard githyanki: <strong>Telekinetic Leap</strong>, an encounter power
that lets them fly 5 squares as a move action. Other attacks and abilities vary
with training.</p>

<h3 id="gith-savage">Gith Savage</h3>

<p>The rank-and-file of any large gith raiding force, the book describes their
lives as nasty, brutish, and short. These Level 4 Minion Skirmishers fight with
obsidian-tipped spears.</p>

<p>The gith’s basic <strong>Spear</strong> attack damages and lets it shift 1 square. Once per
encounter they can enhance one attack into a <strong>Telekinetic Pierce</strong>, which
targets Fortitude, deals the same damage and pushes the target 1 square. I think
this above might be the first psychic power I’ve seen that <em>doesn’t</em> target
Will. There are a few others in this entry.</p>

<h3 id="gith-hobbler">Gith Hobbler</h3>

<p>These hunters are level 4 Artillery with 46 HP. They prefer to stay far away
throwing Range 20 <strong>Javelins</strong>. Once per encounter they can throw a particularly
well-aimed <strong>Pinning Javelin</strong>, that does a bit more damage and immobilizes
(save ends).</p>

<p>If someone gets too close, they’re subject to the hobbler’s aura (1) of <strong>Brain
Fog</strong>, which inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks and damage to enemies inside. I
wonder if there’s one of these near me these days. Someone who insists on
attacking them in melee might force the hobbler to use its <strong>bone dagger</strong>,
which does light damage and lets them shift 1 square on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="gith-spearhead">Gith Spearhead</h3>

<p>A front-line fighter wielding a barbed obsidian-headed spear. It’s a Level 5
Brute with 76 HP. The <strong>Vicious Spear</strong> is pretty strong, as expected of a
brute, and can be used in a <strong>Focused Stab</strong> (recharge 4+) that deals more
damage and knocks prone. If the target is bloodied, the attack deals <em>even more</em>
damage and dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>If the spearhead is reduced to 0 HP, it lets out an <strong>Ancestor’s Appeal</strong>, a
Close Burst 1 that targets Fortitude and deals psychic damage. In addition to
the damage, a hit also inflicts ongoing 5 psychic damage, and a further 5
psychic damage whenever the target uses a daily or encounter power (save ends
both).</p>

<h3 id="git-drone">Git Drone</h3>

<p>Drones are gith that show increased psychic aptitude as children, and are
subject to a torturous training regimen to further develop their powers. They’re
Level 5 Controllers with 62 HP.</p>

<p>Drones emit a <strong>Brain Fog</strong> aura that works like the hobbler’s, but is much
wider in radius (3). They fight with <strong>Bone Daggers</strong> in melee and with
<strong>Telekinetic Thrusts</strong> at up to range 5. These deal force damage, and slide 2
squares.</p>

<p>Every so often they can use a <strong>Psychic Nova</strong> (recharge 5+). This is an Area
Burst 1 Within 5 that targets Reflex, deals untyped damage, and makes the target
suffer 5 psychic damage whenever they use a daily or encounter power (save
ends). If the target is bloodied, it instead deals ongoing 5 damage (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The one time I briefly played a Dark Sun game, one of the PCs was a “standard”
gith fighter, so I had thought the gith of Athas were both unchanged from their
astral relatives and playable. Turns out I was wrong! Mechanically they’re still
similar to githyanki, but their look and feel is pretty different than what I
expected, and there are no rules for gith PCs in the Campaign Setting.</p>

<p>Gith are commonly found in all-gith hunting parties, perhaps accompanied by
domesticated baazrags or other trained beasties. They can also be found in mixed
parties of People, whether as willing members or as slaves commanded to fight.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Recently, I became aware of the Quar. Aren’t they neat?</p>

<figure class="center">

<p>These funny anteater people are the stars of a couple of miniature wargames, the
28mm-scale <strong>Clash of Rhyfles</strong> and the 15mm-scale <strong>This Quar’s War</strong>. Both of
these have their rulebooks freely available <a href="https://rhyfler.com">here</a>, which is also where the
image above comes from.</p>

<p>An individual Quar is a funny little person who just wants to chill with a hot
cup of tea and a plate of moth cakes. Quar <em>societies</em> however are very, er,
quarrelsome, so most of their history is an endless procession of wars.</p>

<p>I was motivated to write this article both because I think the setting is neat,
and because the technical information about Quar weapons in the Clash of Rhyfles
game made me think I can stat them up in GURPS.</p>

<h2 id="very-short-setting-summary">Very Short Setting Summary</h2>

<p>The wargames cover a particularly turbulent period in the history of Aldwyn, the
Quar home world. It’s marked by at least twenty years of worldwide trench
warfare between two large multinational coalitions. The tech level is somewhere
between WW1 and WW2, and this is pretty much the war that introduced industrial
warfare to their world.</p>

<p>If the idea of these adorable creatures being fed into one of the worst
meat-grinders imaginable is horrifying to you, then you get the setting’s main
idea. I’ve heard it described as “grimsical”. It replaces the “dark” vibe from
“grimdark” with “whimsical”, but it’s still grim. The cuter the miniatures for
their soldiers and tanks get, the stronger the dissonance becomes.</p>

<p>The Clash or Rhyfles quickstart book centers on the two main factions of the
war. The Crusade is a coalition of former monarchies who successfully toppled
their old regimes and became republics. They’re led by the Republic of Tok, and
made up of many smaller nations that follow the same standards for equipment and
tactics. The rules here could be used for quar from any of those places.</p>

<p>On the other side, the Kingdom of Coftyr leads an alliance of the world’s
remaining monarchies to stamp out this revolution. Each kingdom here tends to be
visually distinct, as their whole thing is adherence to ancient traditions and
heraldry. Therefore, the book only covers Coftyr itself.</p>

<p>Free add-ons provide details for “sub-factions” allied to either side. These are
Crusader or monarchist nations who do their own thing on the battlefield.</p>

<p>As usual for wargames, both sides are morally ambiguous. Opposing monarchy is a
good thing in my book, but the Crusade is also the side that introduced
industrial warfare to the world. Coftyr flavor text is all about honor and
chivalry and heroism, but they adopted industrial warfare just as readily and at
the end of the day are still defenders of absolute monarchy.</p>

<p>I get the impression that the world of Alwyn could settle into a more or less
stable configuration if everyone just stopped and signed a status quo peace
treaty, but they’ve all been fighting for 20 years by now and none of their
leaders show any sign of wanting to stop.</p>

<p>As usual for wargames, you pick the side you think looks neater, paint them up,
and pit them against other factions in battles that would fit somewhere in those
decades of war. Most of these battles focus on infantry with the occasional
tanks thrown in. There seem to be airships, but I don’t know if they have
airplanes yet.</p>

<h2 id="quar-in-gurps">Quar in GURPS</h2>

<p>The typical Quar is about 1.5 meters tall and weights around 60kg. They follow a
largely humanoid body plan. Their skins can take on any of a large number of
hues, from yellows and greens to blues and purples and oranges. Often, they’re a
little mottled. Their diet tends to include lots of bugs, though those are often
prepared as ingredients in dishes that we would otherwise recognize.</p>

<p>Stat-wise, I’d say they are absolutely identical to humans. If you insist on
being strict, make them about a foot shorter than their ST would indicate, but
do not adjust their stats in any other way. Being a Quar costs 0 points.</p>

<p>Because that’s the thing, you see? Quar are just people. The horrors inflicted
on them are horrible because <em>war</em> is horrible, not because Quar are adorable.</p>

<h2 id="quar-guns-in-gurps">Quar Guns in GURPS</h2>

<p>Guns in Clash or Rhyfles don’t actually have damage ratings, just range and
optional traits. The results of a ranged attack roll depend entirely on the
degree of success for your skill roll. They might leave a target unaffected,
Gobsmacked (stunned) or Taken Out, which is different from “dead”: they might
still be rescued during or after the battle.</p>

<p>However, the skirmish game rules include enough fluff about the infantry weapons
of the Crusade that I kinda want to try statting them up in GURPS. If I ever get
the same information for the Coftyri ones, I’ll stat them up too.</p>

<p>The book mentiones the muzzle velocity and caliber of a couple of the weapons,
and if I make a guess about the weight of the bullet I can plug those three
things in the simplest possible version of the <a href="https://gamingballistic.com/2022/04/11/old-ballistics-spreadsheet-a-repost/">unofficial official GURPS
ballistics equation</a> to get a damage figure.</p>

<p>That link also contains a complete spreadsheet that demands things like chamber
pressure, which I have no chance of figuring out. So stuff like Accuracy and
range will be derived by the older method of eyeballing existing guns, as will
bullet weight.</p>

<p>The numbers in the original material are just there for color, of course. None
of them affect the rules of the miniature wargame itself. But if we take them as
true, we see that Quar are very fond guns with big bullets and powerful
propellant charges, fired out of guns with short barrels and very light
construction. The recoil on those is gonna be ridiculous.</p>

<h3 id="the-bogen-rifle">The Bogen Rifle</h3>

<p>The signature weapon of the Crusade rhyfler, the Bogen semi-automatic rifle is
said to fire a 12mm bullet at 580m/s. It uses a 5 or 10 round magazine and
weights 2.4kg “fully loaded”. Its effective range is 150-250 meters.</p>

<p>The closest real-world bullet to this one in GURPS High-Tech is the
.45-something family of rifle rounds, which are 11.43mm in diameter and weight
31 grams. After some fiddling, I decide to go with a slightly lower 27 grams for
the Quar bullet, which gives us exactly 7d damage. This is pi+ because of the
caliber. Picture them as being broader, shorter and rounder than Earth rifle
cartridges, which is in theme for all things Quar.</p>

<p>This gives us a gun that packs about the same punch as a real-world M1 Garand
rifle while having almost exactly half its weight and about the length of an M16
assault rifle. That’s going to have a significant kick, to say the least.</p>

<h3 id="the-rhyshi-r4-heavy-rifle">The Rhyshi (R4) Heavy Rifle</h3>

<p>Only slightly longer than the Bogen, the Rhyshi fires a huge 20mm round with a
720m/s muzzle velocity. Its magazine carries seven of those, and it’s said to
require a solid stance and firm support to shoot with any kind of accuracy. A
squad mate’s shoulder will do for support, according to the book, but I’m going
to give this rifle an integral folding bipod because I’m not a monster. A
properly braced R4 has greater range than the Bogen, and can penetrate up to
“medium” vehicular armor.</p>

<p>The closest thing to this I can find on High-Tech is the Mauser Tank-Gewehr 18,
the WW1 German anti-tank rifle. Its caliber is “only” 13mm, but it’s the largest
anti-tank rifle in that table that is even removely Quar-portable. Plugging its
bullet mass, caliber and printed velocity in our magic spreadsheet, we get 10d+3
damage, which following High-Tech convention can be rounded and written as
5dx2. Let’s also give it an armor-piercing round, because I see the WW1 tank
examples in the book have DR 45.</p>

<p>5dx2 is the same damage as the T-Gew18, but the Rhyshi again weights less than
half of what the real gun does. It’s not that much longer than the Bogen either,
so it’s gonna be a beast to handle unless it’s properly braced. As the book
says, Quar Crusaders frequently attach a bayonet to the Rhyshi because there’s
no way it can be fired in close quarters.</p>

<h3 id="grifkis-shotgun">Grifkis Shotgun</h3>

<p>This is a 10-gauge, six-kilo trench gun firing buckshot ammo. The only Crusade
gun to still be largely hand-made, it’s carried by officers as a badge of honor
and a symbol of courage. The illustration shows its barrel is fairly short, but
it still has a shoulder stock.</p>

<p>No need to fiddle with spreadsheets this time, we have a 10G double-barrel
shotgun in High Tech. Let’s borrow its stats and adjust for the shortened
“whippet” barrels:</p>

<p>The short barrels give this gun a more pronounced muzzle blast (+1 to Hearing
and Vision to locate when fired in the dark). I’m using the listed weight for it
here, which makes it about 50% heavier than the real world example from
High-Tech. Big caliber, two barrels, extra chonky? This is basically the Doom
Super Shotgun.</p>

<h3 id="h-11a-light-machine-gun">H-11a Light Machine Gun</h3>

<p>According to the book, this LMG fires the same round as the Bogen rifle, and the
Crusade likes to use it as an offensive squad support weapon. It appears longer
than the rifle, and can also be used in vehicular mounts when the force can’t
find heavier MGs to put in there.</p>

<p>I think I’m just going to crib from High-Tech again, and blend some of the
Bogen’s stats with those of the MG34.</p>

<p>This gives us a gun that’s actually heavier than the Rhyshi rifle, and whose
recoil is manageable enough that it’s worth firing more than one bullet per
turn. It fires rounds from a non-disintegrating cloth belt.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Look at those things. Just look at them. Their damage values combined with the
light weight and short barrel means they have <em>powerful</em> powder charges. Quar
like big booms and they cannot lie.</p>

<p>The recoil on these things means the act of firing them is somewhere between
“comical” and “painful for the shooter”. I’m guessing that a Taken Out result in
the wargame very often means the target got spooked and decided to play dead,
instead of actually being hit. This also explains why a quar can take
<em>themselves</em> out on a bad skill roll.</p>

<p>Athas has a lot of the same giants we can see in the Monster Manuals and Monster
Vault. Athasian giants are less militarily aggressive than their counterparts in
other worlds, but they still don’t like interacting with the “small folk”. They
prefer to make their homes in isolated islands on the Silt Sea. A giant who
wants to visit the mainland can often just <em>wade through</em> what to them is
chest-high silt. PCs might be able to negotiate a ride with such a giant, if
they’re diplomatic enough.</p>

<p>In this entry we’ll take a look at two Athas-specific giants, whose descriptions
will help explain why they don’t like the small ones very much.</p>

<h2 id="beast-giants">Beast Giants</h2>

<p>Beast Giants are the product of psionic experimentation by ancient masters of
the Way, who have stabilized into their own species. They have bodies similar to
that of hill giants, but the heads of beasts.</p>

<p>Each giant’s head is different, and can be similar to that of any Athasian
beast, whether currently living or extinct. So PCs might be faced with something
familiar like a Cilops or Baazrag-headed giant, or with some exotic ancient
cryptid like a lion, tiger or bear. Oh my! Their skill at mind-reading is such
that they can copy most techniques used against them on the fly during a fight.</p>

<p>Beast Giants are fairly cosmopolitan sorts and frequently associate with other
types of giant and giant-kin who share their islands: hill giants, firbolgs,
brohgs, and others.</p>

<h3 id="beast-giant">Beast Giant</h3>

<p>The typical beast giant is Large Natural Humanoid (Giant) and a Level 15 Brute
with 180 HP and a ground speed of 7 and Low-light Vision.</p>

<p>No matter what their head looks like, it gives them a <strong>Rending Bite</strong> that
deals heavy immediate damage and ongoing 5 damage (save ends). Once per
encounter they can use the <strong>Red of Tooth</strong> power to make three bite attacks on
the same action, each against a different target.</p>

<p>When someone attacks a beast giant, they can use <strong>Psionic Retention</strong> as a
reaction. They still suffer the damage and any riders normally, but they also
“retain” that result, so keep a note of it. They can then use this to power
their <strong>Psionic Release</strong> attack (melee 2 vs. Fortitude). A hit deals the exact
same amount and type of damage, and the exact same riders, as the giant’s
“retained” attack. Psionic Release recharges when the giant uses Psionic
Retention again, so it effectively “spends” the retained attack.</p>

<h3 id="beast-titan">Beast Titan</h3>

<p>The oldest Beast Giants have grown enough in power and size to qualify as Beast
Titans. They’re a lot more aggressive than their younger counterparts and love
displaying the skulls of their enemies as trophies.</p>

<p>These are Huge instead of Large, and they’re Level 20 Elite Brutes with 466
HP. Their ground speed is an 8, and their <strong>Beast Reflexes</strong> let them roll a
save to avoid falling prone.</p>

<p>Their Psionic Retention and Release powers work the same as the giant’s, with
the greater range and numbers from their larger size and level. Their <strong>Gnashing
Bite</strong> is also upgraded.</p>

<p>As a minor action the titan can use <strong>Titan’s Embrace</strong> (melee 3 vs. reflex) to
do some light damage and grab on a hit. And once it has a grabbed victim, it can
use <strong>Head Rip</strong> to deal massive damage, plus the same ongoing damage as the
bite. The giant also throws the victim 10 squares and knocks it prone at the
end.</p>

<h2 id="shadow-giant">Shadow Giant</h2>

<figure class="center">

<p>Unlike the Death Giants of the monster manual, who are merely death-_themed_,
Shadow Giants are actual undead. They’re vengeful spirits who seek retribution
from an ancient slaughter, likely from the Red Age. They look like shadows cast
on a wall.</p>

<p>They tend to be loners, or to ally with those giants that still retain a strong
elemental connection (like fire and stone giants). Sometimes, a brohg renegade
will seek them out to learn the ancient arcane secrets the shadow still
rememebers.</p>

<p>Shadow Giants are Large Shadow Humanoids with the Undead and Giant tags, and
Level 18 Soldiers with 185 HP. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 7, and a
flight speed of 3. Like most undead, they are immune to disease and poison and
have 20 necrotic resistance. They’re also insubstantial, but lack Phasing.</p>

<p>A shadow giant projects an aura (5) of <strong>Shadow Malaise</strong> that halves any
healing that takes place inside. Whenever they take radiant damage, they’re
<strong>Revealed by Radiance</strong> and become substantial for a turn.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Necrotic Touch</strong>, which targets Reflex, deals necrotic
damage, and marks on a hit (save ends). They also have a non-basic <strong>Death
Touch</strong> that is similar, but exchanges some of its direct damage for an
additional ongoing 10 necrotic damage rider (save ends both this and the mark).</p>

<p>If a marked enemy makes an attack that doesn’t include the giant, they are
<strong>Cast Into Shadow</strong> as a reaction. This is a melee attack that targets
Reflex. A hit does no damage, but removes the target from play for a turn! This
means they’re stunned and removed from the map, reappearing at their previous
position when the effect ends.</p>

<p>The giant’s ability to possibly mark multiple PCs makes it a very effective
“defender”. Cast Into Shadow is a very potent “save or suck” attack, so PCs will
have an extra incentive to focus on the giant and not on its other buddies. And
if they don’t, the giant has just removed a whole PC from consideration for the
next round.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Athas is prime giant country and plenty of core giants would be happy as clams
living here, but I guess it makes sense to have some setting-specific ones to
signal that we’re not in Kansas any more.</p>

<p>Beast giants and titans feel a bit redundant, but their appearance is certainly
striking. Shadow Giants have intriguing mechanics, but you probably don’t want
to have more than one of these in play at any given encounter. They can also be
used in other settings without a lot of modification, as “undead giant with a
grudge” is a pretty universal concept.</p>

<p>Athas is a world with plenty of horrible death in it, so of course it has plenty
of ghosts.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The ghosts we’re talking about in this entry are also called “raaigs”, so you
can use that word when nomenclature is important and you want to distinguish
them from wraiths, specters, or the specific D&amp;D monster actually called a
Ghost.</p>

<p>They are specifically the ghosts of priests and holy warriors that served the
now-dead gods of Athas, and who met their demise while charged with protecting
their holy sites and relics.</p>

<p>The typical encounter with a raaig will happen when the PCs enter the ruins of
such a place. The ghost, still fulfilling its mission, will manifest and
challenge the intruders to check whether they’re devout pilgrims or dastardly
thieves. Since no one alive remembers the proper prayers and passwords to
appease these spirits, they are likely to attack.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Raaigs have the full ghost package: ground and flight speeds of 6, Darkvision,
phasing, insubstantial, immune to disease and poison. The book mentions they
become corporeal for a moment when they attack, but this moment doesn’t last
long enough to influence their stat blocks, which considers them to be
insubstantial at all times.</p>

<p>They don’t have any weaknesses that let them become partially corporeal
either, so the only way to deal full damage to a raaig is if you’re using the
rules update that makes force damage fully affect all insubstantial creatures.</p>

<h3 id="raaig-tomb-spirit">Raaig Tomb Spirit</h3>

<p>Your common specimen as far as these very specific ghosts go. The Tomb Spirit is
a Level 9 Soldier with 66 HP, which looks like a small number until you remember
it will be taking half damage from everything.</p>

<p>The tomb spirit projects an aura (1) of <strong>Gripping Dread</strong>, which forbids
enemies inside from shifting and deals 5 cold damage to enemies marked by the
spirit who make an attack that doesn’t target it. This is a spooky version of
the Paladin’s mark mechanic.</p>

<p>Its main attack is a <strong>chilling blade</strong> that deals cold damage. As a minor
action once per round it can issue the <strong>Raaig’s Challenge</strong>, which targets
Will, and pulls 2 squares and marks for a turn on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="raaig-crypt-lord">Raaig Crypt Lord</h3>

<p>A higher-ranking guardian in life, the Crypt Lord is a Level 14 Soldier with the
Leader tag and 96 HP. It’s mostly a Tomb Spirit with bigger numbers and improved
abilities:</p>

<p>Its <strong>Chilling Blade</strong> deals more damage and marks on a hit; its <strong>Gripping
Dread</strong> has a radius of 2; ts <strong>Challenge</strong> pulls 4 squares instead of 2.</p>

<p>The one new ability here is <strong>Ghostly Command</strong> (recharge 6+) which lets each
undead ally within 5 squares of the lord shift 2 squares and make a basic
attack. As this takes a standard action, it will probably be used to open the
fight.</p>

<h3 id="raaig-souflame">Raaig Souflame</h3>

<p>This is the ghost of someone who was so favored by the gods in life that they
retained a small spark of divine power after death. Their hold on this spark is
tenuous, however, and it might leave them if they’re too damaged. In this case,
they will be turned into desperate beasts full of grief and rage. This is a
Level 21 Skirmisher with 138 HP and all raaig traits.</p>

<p>The idea here is that they lose the divine spark when bloodied, and so they
effectively have two sets of abilities and movement speeds - one for when they
have the spark, and one for when they don’t.</p>

<p>When “healthy”, the soulflame has a ground speed of 8 and a teleport speed
of 3. It attacks with a <strong>Divine Blade</strong> that deals a mix of untyped and radiant
damage and lets the ghost teleport 3 squares on a hit. It can get fancy with
this and use it to perform a <strong>Flickering Phantom</strong> maneuver (recharge 5+): the
souflame teleports 4 squares, makes a stronger than usual sword attack, then
teleports another 4 squares and makes another, weaker attack. The teleports are
effects, so they happen even if the attacks miss.</p>

<p>When bloodied, it loses the ability to teleport and gains a flight speed of 8
instead. Its main attack becomes a <strong>Deathly Blade</strong> whose added damage is
necrotic instead of radiant, and which makes the target only regain half HP from
healing for a turn. Its Flickering Phantom ability is replaced with <strong>Hollow
Rage</strong>, an encounter power that deals heavy damage and prevents the target from
regaining HP entirely (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The book says raaigs are intelligent and strong-willed enough to take command of
most other undead that haunt their temples, such as skeletons, mummies, and
other ghosts, so these will make up their allies in an encounter. It also
reminds us that not all gods were good - protectors of evil temples might still
have command of the devils or demons that also served its patron god. Souflames
in particular are likely to attract surviving angels that served the same deity,
as they are drawn to that faint spark.</p>

<p>This makes me think that a non-hostile raaig makes an excellent mentor and
teached for the super-rare divine PCs of Athas. Maybe your cleric or paladin was
trained by the soulflame who is the Last Priest of Pelor and who was aware
enough to take the PC under their wing instead of treating them as an intruder.</p>

<p>And if angels and devils arrive to serve such ghosts, that’d be a big draw to
someone who is researching a way into the Astral Sea, as I think that plane is
not normally accessible from Athas.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2025/06/13/ultra-tech-dungeons.html">Ultra-Tech Dungeon Delving in GURPS</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I started writing this post a few years ago when I was GMing the Iron Gods
adventure path for Pathfinder using the Dungeon Fantasy RPG rules. My approach
to that campaign was pretty slap-dash, and after I stopped I began thinking of a
more structured way to do it. Since a recent comment here on the blog asked for
specifics, I though I’d dust the post off and publish it.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have a Dungeon Fantasy game where you want your characters to get
into contact with more advanced technology. How would you go about it?</p>

<h2 id="ultra-tech-delving-a-survey">Ultra-Tech Delving: A Survey</h2>

<p>Steve Jackson games did a little foray into this area in Pyramid #3/60, in an
article entitled “High-Tech Dungeon Crawl”, which focused on bringing modern-day
characters with guns into fantasy dungeons to mow down orcs with autofire and
take their stuff. This raises the inherent level of colonalism in the genre from
“concerning” to “yikes!”<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>What I want to focus on here is in an older variation on the theme: fantasy
characters exploring “dungeons” filled with elements you might be more used to
seeing in science fiction stories. When I say “older”, I mean it’s <em>older than
D&amp;D</em>: Dave Arneson’s Blackmoor campaign featured a whole ultra-tech city-state
descended from the crew of a crashed spaceship, and it was played for several
years before what became the OD&amp;D rules were finalized and officially
published. D&amp;D proper would explore the same territory with its famous
“Expedition to the Barrier Peaks” module.</p>

<p>Pathfinder dedicates a whole kingdom in its setting to the idea: the land of
Numeria is a barbarian kingdom where a giant spaceship crashed millenia ago,
breaking up during atmospheric entry and scattering its many modules all over
the region. And, of course, in Gamma World and other post-apocalyptic games
<em>all</em> “dungeons” are ultra-tech because they’re the ruins of the futuristic
civilization that preceded the apocalypse.</p>

<h2 id="ultra-tech-delving-in-gurps">Ultra-Tech Delving in GURPS</h2>

<p>GURPS is of course a uniquely well-suited system for this kind of thing. Its
rules already support a wide range of genres and technology levels from the
corebook onwards. We only need a few adjustments depending on the sort of
campaign we want.</p>

<p><em>After The End</em> already deals with the post-apocalyptic angle and offers a set
of detailed rules. What I want, however, is something simpler and more suited to
a Barrier Peaks/Numeria scenario. The ultra-tech stuff is alien, but characters
can gain an understanding of it with some investment, and the gap between their
usual medievalish milieu and the lofty heights of alien tech isn’t completely
impossible to cross. How would I do it?</p>

<h3 id="tech-level-or-the-lack-thereof">Tech Level, or the Lack Thereof.</h3>

<p>So on one side we have the usual “medievalish” dungeon fantasy setting. In
GURPS, that’s roughtly TL 4, but without gunpowder. On the other side we have a
space-opera intrusion, which corresponds very roughly to a TL9-10 selection with
a few outliers (personal shields are TL11-12, but they fit the flavor). With
these vague numbers in mind, we can ditch the concept of Tech Levels completely
for our treatment!</p>

<p>Default GURPS Tech Level rules are only useful for giving us a starting set of
gadgets to work with. In actual play, the only thing that matters is if a given
thing is “low-tech” and thus familiar to everyone, or “high-tech” and thus a
mystery to the uninitiated. How to differentiate both? With the following
advantage:</p>

<h3 id="tech-familiarity-10-points">Tech Familiarity (10 points)</h3>

<p>You have a layman’s knowledge of the basic principles behind the advanced
technology scattered through your otherwise medieval fantasy world. You
understand why it isn’t magic. You know about electricity and how it powers
high-tech devices. You grasp enough of the high-tech design aesthetic to easily
spot a device’s charging port or battery, its control surfaces (be they
switches, triggers, or touchpads), its information displays, and its business
end even if you don’t know what the thing actually <em>does</em>. You can identify the
high-tech civilization’s writing even though you can’t read it, and you can
identify its iconography for “danger”. You can also recognize hazards like
exposed live wires, recognize which type of power cell goes into a device, and
plug it in.</p>

<p>This is a form of Unusual Background that makes you immune to the sort of
amusing accident which plagues other low-tech explorers confronted with
high-tech devices.</p>

<p>More importantly, Tech Familiarity is a pre-requisite for learning high-tech
skills, and the language of the high-tech civilization (if any). With this
advantage, you can spend points on those things normally.</p>

<p>Yes, this is quite similar to High TL from the core book, but much cheaper. The
reason is that paying 30-35 points in High TL to get the same benefits is way
too expensive for a campaign in this mold. This advantage doesn’t give you any
familiarity with deeper aspects of the high-tech civilization, just what’s in
the first paragraph.</p>

<h3 id="tech-skills">Tech Skills</h3>

<p>Skills that would require a /TL specialization in standard GURPS rules have only
two versions here: standard (no suffix) and “/Tech”. That way, you don’t need to
change anything about how you write down a standard “medievalish” character.</p>

<p>The two specialties don’t overlap at all: they don’t default to each other, and
can’t be used at all across the “tech divide”. If you only have standard
Lockpicking, you can’t open a high-tech door with a magnetic lock. If you only
have Lockpicking/Tech, you can’t open low-tech mechanical locks with
old-fashioned picks, tough you might be able to operate a machine that does it
for you.</p>

<p>High-tech weapons are usually firearms of beam weapons - the skills to operate
them properly are always “/Tech” skills. High-Tech <em>melee</em> weapons are a
possible exception to the “no defaults” rule above, though the GM would need to
rule on each case:</p>

<p>Weapons that use the same skill as their low-tech counterparts can be used
normally by anyone if the only difference is in their construction (such as a
superfine or hyperdense blade). If they have some additional feature that
requires power (such as a vibroblade or shock baton) then the character has a -2
penalty to use that feature unless they have Tech Familiarity. If they require
an exclusive skill to operate (like a force sword or monowire whip) then that
skill has the “/Tech” suffix. You might be able to get away with a default to a
low-tech skill here, but the only way to improve on that is to buy Tech
Familiarity and the high-tech skill.</p>

<h3 id="ultra-tech-gear">Ultra-Tech Gear</h3>

<p>With the character stuff out of the way, we can talk about the goodies! As I
mentioned above, one advantage of GURPS is that it has entire books of high- and
ultra-tech gadgets that can be plugged straight into your fantasy
campaigns. Therefore, we don’t need to talk about how to stat this stuff up at
all! What we <em>do</em> need is talk about the effects it’s going to have on your
campaign, which in turn will aid you in selecting which items to include.</p>

<h4 id="how-much-is-this-stuff-worth">How much is this stuff worth?</h4>

<p>A vital question in the dungeon fantasy genre! Going more or less by the book,
high-tech items should be worth roughly 30 times their list price in a dungeon
fantasy setting. That makes even a relatively innocuous gadget into a major
piece of loot!</p>

<p>This might seem a bit too much for a dungeon fantasy setting where magic and
magic items are relatively common, but I think it kinda makes sense. Ultra-tech
items are going to be a lot rarer than magic items, particularly in settings
where they come from that single crashed spaceship. They work regardless of the
local mana and sanctitiy levels. And they can be enchanted! These are exactly
the same reasons why a suit of fine plate armor costs more than a standard suit
enchanted with Lighten 1.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: A superfine broadword would cost $3600 in its native ultra-tech
society. Recovered from a crashed spaceship in a dungeon fantasy setting, it’s
worth $108,000!</p>

<p>That sword gives a +2 bonus to damage and a (2) armor divisor. The closest
“low-tech” equivalent would be a very fine sword with a Penetrating Weapon
enchantment, worth $17,000, almost ten times cheaper. Even if all the bonuses
were from magic, it would still cost only $25,600. However, the superfine blade
will lose none of its functionality in a low- or no-mana zone, and it could be
enchanted with the same magic as the low-tech sword to become even better.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> think that this is too much, you could say that the value of
ultra-tech gear is capped by the value of magic items with similar
properties. The sword from the example would be worth $17,000 then. Gear that
has no magical equivalent might still use the “uncapped” price.</p>

<h4 id="timeworn-gear">Timeworn Gear</h4>

<p>One concept from Pathfinder that’s useful to borrow is that of timeworn
items. In Barrier Peaks-style setups, most of the high-tech stuff the PCs come
across has been sitting around in derelict ruins for a very long time; even if
it was very well-built, it might not have withstood the passage of the ages
intact. To model that, we introduce the following equipment modifier:</p>

<p><strong>Timeworn</strong>: This can be applied to any high-tech armor, weapon, or device that
requires power or ammunition to function. These items can’t be recharged. After
whatever reserves they contain when found are used up, they’ll break down and
become useless. They may also have other quirks arising from their almost-broken
state at the GM’s discretion. Divide final price by 10.</p>

<h4 id="weapons-and-armor">Weapons and Armor</h4>

<p>Weapons and armor deserve special mention because Dungeon Fantasy is a
combat-heavy genre, and this combat has a very specific “feel” to it. Therefore,
high-tech combat gear will have an outsize impact on it.</p>

<p>Baseline Dungeon Fantasy suggests that PCs should have a maximum total DR of
about 15, as anything more than that will make them invulnerable to too many
monster attacks.</p>

<p>PC damage also has some upper bounds. Spellcasters with missile spells and a
spellcasting talent of 6 can do a maximum of 18d damage, though that requires
enough setup to only be possible about once per fight, and not on all
fights. The maximum amount of “at-will” melee and ranged damage a PC can do is
equivalent to about 7d per attack<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Introducing ultra-tech armor into the game almost certainly means you’re going
to exceed the DR cap. Even non-combat safety gear at these tech levels has as
much DR as low-tech plate, while being much lighter. Proper combat armor is much
tougher. Most of the published DF enemies will have trouble getting past the DR
of a PC in full ultra-tech armor with their physical attacks.</p>

<p>Similarly, high-tech weapons can change the shape of combat in your
campaign. Dungeon Fantasy usually considers melee to be the main event and
ranged combat to be a specialist niche, but if guns and beam weapons are common
these two are going to swap places.</p>

<p>Ultra-tech melee and ranged weapons can also allow PCs to approach or exceed the
upper damage bounds described above much more easily. Both “boundaries” are
roughly equivalent to rolling 7d of damage per attack. A force sword does 8d; a
laser rifle does 6d, and can can fire many more shots per turn than a bow with
no penalty. Both of those have armor divisors too, which make enemy DR become
much less of an obstacle.</p>

<p>The first step when addressing these issues is to carefully consider which items
are available. What do you want your campaign’s new DR cap to be? What is the
highest armor divisor you’re comfortable with? What sort of maximum damage do
you want your PCs to do with a melee or ranged attack they can use every second?
And, to quote Mister Torgue from Borderlands 2: EXPLOSIONS?</p>

<p>The second step is to consider the same thing from the side of the opposition:
what’s the highest DR and damage you estimate <em>they</em> will be able to routunely
bring to the table? The gear available to the PCs should give them a chance to
match those figures.</p>

<p>You can then safely remove anything that exceeds your new planned limits. That
will end up giving you a pretty good set of guidelines for what the ultra-tech
culture and their ruins look like. A civilian medical lab infested with
non-sapient monsters and low-tech looters might have plenty of medkits and
wonder drugs, but no weapon heavier than a couple of timeworn electrolasers and
some scalpels the thief can use as superfine daggers. For a military base filled
with killer robots and with a tank at the end as a boss fight, the sky is the
limit, though those anti-tank weapons might all be timeworn if you don’t want
the PCs using them outside.</p>

every turn and do 3d+13 per attack. This is theoretically possible right out
of character creation if your knight is a half-ogre. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>A ST 20 Scout with Weapon Master and Strongbow might be able to shoot once
per turn and do about 4d+10 per shot. This particular boundary is hard to
reach, so your highest “at-will” ranged damage will probably be less than
that. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
