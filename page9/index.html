<p>A new group, and a surprise lesson on Nerath’s history!</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>So far we’ve only got the bare minimum of information on the history and
geography of Nerath as a whole. We mostly know that the Vale was part of its
northern frontier, that it did a number on the Vale’s native peoples when it
moved in, and that it fell about a hundred years ago. This entry gives lots of
new information because the history of the Phantom Brigade is intimately tied to
that of the empire of Nerath.</p>

<p>The Empire of Nerath was founded in the distant south around six hundred years
ago, with the establishment its capital city of Nera. It quickly spread in all
directions and became a world power. Its long history starts with an early
period of rapid expansion, goes through the troubled and despotic rule of
Emperor Magroth, and then through a long period of hegemonic peace and
stability. This peace lasted until the empire’s abrupt fall about 100 years ago.</p>

<p>No one knows exactly how the fall of Nerath happened (or, if they do, they’re
keeping it a secret). What is known is that a combination of traumatic events
that might have included both monster attacks and natural disasters left the
entire imperial family unaccounted for. Nerath’s armies were left leaderless and
without direction, and all the simmering conflicts between its noble houses blew
up with no one to keep them in line. Soon the complex infrastructure that united
all regions of the empire stopped being maintained and crumbled, turning its
cities and provinces into the scattered points of light we know today.</p>

<p>Nerath had several knightly orders at the time of its fall, and none where more
prestigious than the Knights of the Empire. Imperial Knights were paladins and
rangers selected for their skill, loyalty, and nobility of character. They
answered directly to the Emperor, acting as his personal bodyguards and
extensions of his will. When everything went to ruin, they were one of the few
groups who remained committed to defending the empire and keeping it
whole. Nearly all of them died in the decade between the initial catastrophe and
the day everyone finally acknowledged Nerath was no more.</p>

<p>This did not stop the Knights, however. The oaths that bound them to the order
were more than just pretty words. They included a mysterious magical effect or
curse that eventually made the dead Knights return as ghosts. This started
happening decades after the fall. Though the Knights know their empire has
fallen, they are still compelled to seek the honor they could not gain in life,
and fulfill their oaths as best they can. They are now known as the Phantom
Brigade.</p>

<p>The first recorded appearance of the ghost knights was right here on the Vale,
when three of them were spotted racing through the Gardbury Downs. In our
narrative present they can be seen anywhere the hand of Nera used to reach.</p>

<p>Knights look much as they did in life, though ghostly and translucent. This
means you have a very important decision to make. Is the Nazgul-looking fellow
in the illustration a typical Knight, or is he Sir Georg Edgelord, who is an
outlier and should not be counted? Your answer will say very interesting things
about Nerath either way.</p>

<p>Their weapons bear the emblem of the Threefold Crown of Nerath, unmistakably
marking their bearers as Knights of the Empire. Those weapons and also serve as
the receptacle for their souls.</p>

<p>Though we saw in previous entries that Nerath did some pretty horrible shit in
the past, the Knights seem genuinely concerned about upholding its highest
ideals and their original oaths, even though they’re ghosts. They will not
attack random travelers unprovoked and will probably be enthusiastic allies
in the fight against threats to the Vale if they can be convinced of the need
for this alliance.</p>

<p>However, they can still come into conflict with the PCs if they try to trespass
upon the areas the Knights still protect (which are full of juicy
treasure-filled Nerathi ruins). In these cases a fight might be avoided if the
PCs can present the Knights with a genuine writ of passage or Nerathi signet
ring.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Phantom Brigade members are Medium Shadow Humanoids with the Undead tag. Most of
them are former humans. They have Darkvision and immunity to disease and poison,
but lack the usual resistances and vulnerabilities. They have ground speeds of
6.</p>

<p>As ghosts, our knights have both Insubstantial and Phasing. Only force damage
will deal full damage to them, and since they don’t have additional
vulnerabilities the trait can’t be temporarily shut down. They do tend to have
less HP than a typical monster of their level, which somewhat compensates for
it.</p>

<p>Their unique signature trait is <strong>Unrelenting Brigade</strong>. Whenever an ally who
also has this trait drops to 0 HP within 5 squares of the knight, they gain a +2
to-hit bonus until the end of their next turn.</p>

<p>Every single stat block in this entry has Lawful Good as its Alignment, a rarity
in monster and NPC stat blocks.</p>

<p>Level-wise, the Phantom Brigade can be a threat from the mid-Heroic to the mid
Paragon-tier, putting them on the same bracket as, say, the Gray Company.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-brigade-squire">Phantom Brigade Squire</h3>

<p>Squires are Level 6 Minion Soldiers. They can attack with their <strong>Soulbound
Short Swords</strong> and their <strong>Spectral Crossbows</strong>, both of which deal psychic
damage. If an enemy hits an ally adjacent to the squire with a melee attack,
they can use <strong>Shielding Martyr</strong> to become the target of that attack instead.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-brigade-armiger">Phantom Brigade Armiger</h3>

<p>Armigers are Level 7 Brutes with 71 HP. They fight with <strong>Soulbound Bardiches</strong>
that deal psychic damage, and their charges use the <strong>Charging Rebuke</strong> special
attack that deals the same amount of damage, push the target 1 square, and knock
it prone. They can also make <strong>Furious Sweeps</strong> to attack everyone in a Close
Blast 2 for slightly less damage.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-brigade-justiciar">Phantom Brigade Justiciar</h3>

<p>These Level 7 Skirmishers have 54 HP and project an aura (1) of <strong>Blind
Justice</strong> that inflicts a -2 to-hit penalty on enemies caught inside. They fight
with <strong>Soulbound Hammers</strong> that can be used in melee or thrown, and they can
<strong>Evade and Strike</strong> at will. This ends any marks on them, lets them shift 4
squares, and then make a basic melee attack.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-brigade-banneret">Phantom Brigade Banneret</h3>

<p>Bannerets are likely minor officers, since their name means “one who carries a
banner”. They’re Level 8 Soldiers with the Leader tag and 60 HP. Their phantom
banner projects a <strong>Gift of Grace</strong> aura (3) that grants a +5 bonus to saves to
allies inside.</p>

<p>The banneret fights with a <strong>Soulbound Tulwar</strong>, which does psychic and radiant
damage. As an effect, it also marks and slows the target for a turn. If a marked
enemy within 5 squares tries to make an attack that doesn’t target the banneret,
they can use <strong>Stalwart Restraint</strong> as a reaction. This always hits! It
immobilizes the target and inflicts 10 ongoing psychic damage on them (save ends</p>

<p>Bannerets are quite danregous. Their attacks always do something and they’re a
lot more dangerous to ignore than your typical soldier monster.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-brigade-templar">Phantom Brigade Templar</h3>

<p>These imposing undead paladins bring the Brigade into the paragon tier. They’re
Level 12 Controllers with 85 HP. They fight with <strong>Soulbound Morningstars</strong> that
deal psychic damage and slide 2 squares on a hit. They can attack at range with
<strong>Righteous Strikes</strong> that deal cold and radiant damage, and also slow on a hit
(save ends). And they can use their <strong>Frightful Majesty</strong> to attack enemies in
a Close Burst 1 and daze them for a turn on a hit. This recharges when they’re
first bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-brigade-knight-commander">Phantom Brigade Knight-Commander</h3>

<p>Knight-Commanders are high-ranking officers, likely responsible for leading all
Imperial Knights in a given region. They’re Level 14 Soldiers with the Leader
tag and 96 HP.</p>

<p>Their weapon of choice is a <strong>Keening Soulbound Backsword</strong>, which deals psychic
and thunder damage and which marks the target for a turn as an effect. The sword
can be used in a <strong>Soul Strike</strong> maneuver (recharge 5+) that deals more damage
and gives the knight-commander 10 temporary HP. The commander can also attack
enemies in a Close Burst 1 by repeating the <strong>Oath of Nerath</strong>, which targets
Fortitude and deals psychic damage.</p>

<p>If an enemy within 2 squares that’s marked by the commander chooses to ignore
the mark, the commander can use <strong>Call to Arms</strong> to allow an ally within 5
squares to shift 3 spaces and make a free basic attack against the triggering
enemy.</p>

<p>If my assumption back in the first paragraph is correct, there’s a
Knight-Commander in the Vale. The book doesn’t give any information about that
individual, so you’re free to come up with their backstory and description
yourself.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Turns out undead in 4e don’t <em>have</em> to be evil! The magic binding these knights
to the world could still be quite bad, but it has not affected their souls or
personalities. Still, as mentioned, they might end up fighting PCs who insist on
exploring former Nerathi sites the knights consider to be under their
protection.</p>

<p>I’m very interested in what might happen if the Gray Company or one of their
Nerathi revivalist rivals runs into the Phantom Brigade. I imagine that anyone
who meets with the knights’ approval will have the legitimacy of their claims
greatly bolstered… but I also imagine that Halvath Cormarrin would <em>not</em> have
their approval. On the other hand, the Knight-Commander’s sword is likely the
weapon Cormarrin is after, because that’s an easy and fun connection to make.</p>

<p>Things will turn out very differently it Cormarrin does in fact have a way to
compel the Phantom Brigade to be loyal to him. This could be the thing that
catapults the Gray Company into a paragon-tier threat. In that case, making the
Knights turn against him would be a key step in defeating their imperialist
aims.</p>

<p>If you want the Phantom Brigade to be evil after all, you can use their stats
exactly as they are presented and only change their alignment and behavior. You
can also add some Death Knights to their number, since they are also evil undead
knights with their souls bound to their weapons. You might say those are members
of the order who managed to retain their physical bodies after all this time.</p>

<p>It’s possible perytons appeared in previous editions, but this is the first time
I remember seeing them. I think they might be based in real-world folklore?</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Perytons are large predators that resemble big raptor birds with antlered,
sharp-fanged stag heads. The feathers on the bird part are typically dark green,
and the stag’s fur is blue-black. Both males and females have antlers, but males
also have distinctive light blue feathers on their chests. Their shadows,
interestingly enough, don’t correspond to their physical shapes and are instead
humanoid. Perytons like to nest in tall mountain ridges, which in the Vale means
the Cairngorm peaks and Stonemarch to the northwest, or the Dawnforge range to
the east.</p>

<p>Some sages speculate that the first perytons were elves changed by some horrible
curse, and there are enough sinister details about their behavior and lifecycle
to lend credence to this even if you ignore the “humanoid shadow” thing.</p>

<p>Travelers are advised to keep their eyes on the sky when going through these
mountainous regions, because perytons are a fairly common hazard there. Not only
are they unafraid to attack people, they specifically go after humanoid prey due
to a very suspicious quirk of their reproductive cycle: peryton females need to
consume the fresh heart of a humanoid in order to reproduce. This will cause
their shadows to reflect their true forms for a number of hours, during which
they are fertile.</p>

<p>Perytons are classed as beasts because they look and behave like animals, but
they’re also clever enough to keep victims alive in their nests until it’s time
to eat, to ensure the freshness of their hearts. They can carry off victims as
big as themselves and won’t generally stick around to keep fighting if they can
make a clean getaway with a victim. However, they’re extremely stubborn and
obsessive - once a peryton chooses someone as their prey, they will pursue and
hunt that victim until they manage to kill it or carry it away, heedless of the
danger and ignoring easier prey.</p>

<p>Peryton nests usually have an area for “storing” its captured victims, who have
a hard time leaving because the surrounding terrain isn’t easy for a non-flier
to traverse. These areas tend to be full of treasure in the form of former
victims’ belongings, and some captives can end up finding a way to escape by
using these things.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Perytons are Natural Beasts. Their signature traits are <strong>Peryton’s Prey</strong>,
which allows them to designate a creature they can see at the start of their
turn as their prey, and <strong>Unhindered</strong>, which allows it to pull any creature it
has grabbed along with it when moving.</p>

<p>A peryton’s choice of prey lasts a turn - they must make the choice again at the
start of each of their turns. It’s totally possible to keep choosing the same
creature, and most perytons will do that, but if the PCs contrive to make that
creature too hard to reach, they can and will make a different choice. This has
no inherent effects, but several of the creature’s powers work best on its
chosen prey.</p>

<h3 id="peryton">Peryton</h3>

<p>The basic model is Medium in size, and is a Level 4 Skirmisher with 54 HP. Its
ground speed is a laughable 2, but its flight speed is 8. The peryton’s basic
attack is an <strong>Antler Bash</strong> that knocks prone on a hit and deals extra damage
to the peryton’s chosen prey. It can use it to make <strong>Flyby Attacks</strong>, flying
its speed, attacking a target along the path, and not provoking opportunity
attacks when it moves away.</p>

<p>Its other special attack is <strong>Claw Snatch</strong>, which can only target the peryton’s
chosen prey, which must be Medium or smaller. The creature can fly half its
speed before and after the attack. A hit deals damage and grabs the victim
(escape DC 14). The grab automatically ends at the end of the peryton’s next
turn, but that’s enough time for the beast to gain plenty of altitude or to fly
over a convenient cliff drop. This recharges when the peryton is first bloodied.</p>

<p>Finally, the creature can use an encounter ability named <strong>Feast</strong> against a
dying humanoid to automatically kill it and heal 15 HP. I imagine this involves
eating the target’s heart. Never let these things take you to negative HP!</p>

<h3 id="peryton-elder">Peryton Elder</h3>

<p>A larger, older, and stronger specimen, of the sort who ends up generating
stories and legends about itself. It’s a Level 6 Elite Soldier with 144 HP.</p>

<p>The elder has upgraded versions of Claw Snatch and Feast. The first has a grab
that <em>doesn’t</em> end after a turn, allowing the monster to carry its victim clear
out of the fight if they’re unlucky in their DC 15 escape rolls. The second
heals 20 HP instead of 15. It also has Antler Bash, but that’s more or less the
same.</p>

<p>The elder also has a couple of new powers to better perform its soldierly
duties. <strong>Cursed Bite</strong> is a minor action that deals physical damage and
inflicts another 5 points if the target attacks a creature other than the elder
on its next turn. Once per encounter, it can use <strong>Stealth Dive</strong> to charge its
chosen prey if that prey makes an attack that doesn’t include the elder as a
target.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Despite their “natural” origin, these monsters are creepy and evocative. They’re
much more threatening than their level indicates too, being one of the few
creatures who will explicitly target and kill PCs who are down and out. Being
carried off by an elder peryton sucks, too, but it could lead to a fun scene a
captured PCs trying to improvise an escape route using the items found on the
nest.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/02/08/penanggalan.html">Let&#39;s Read Threats to the Nentir Vale: Penanggalan</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>No illustration this time. The book has one, but it’s quite gross.</p>

<p>The Penanggalan is a monster from Southeast Asian folklore (the name used here
is Malay). It was first statted up for D&amp;D in the Fiend Folio, and this is its
4e debut. This entry does make some effort to tie its lore to the Nentir Vale,
but I still think it fits into the “generic monster” category.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Legend has it that the first penanggalan was a young baroness in Harkenwold, who
was very smart but “plain of face and scant of suitors”. She found a cache of
old diabolism texts from Bael Turath one day, and decided to use them to improve
her situation. She conjured a devil using the Turathi rituals, and made a deal
where the devil would make her forever young and beautiful in exchange for
eternal servitude.</p>

<p>The lady did become beautiful, but it was the sort of beauty that comes from a
devil’s bargain: so beautiful she was that armies clashed for her hand, and that
her father eventually decided to lock her up in a tower for protection. Alone in
her tower, the baroness prayed to the gods and begged for forgiveness, swearing
to do penance before them.</p>

<p>The devil that made the deal with her did not like this one bit, and before she
could start atoning for her sins, he whispered the secret of her beauty in the
ear of Harkenwold’s high priest. The priest was one of those “zero tolerance”
types, so he had the lady hanged as a diabolist. Her body remained in the
gallows until midnight, and then her head and entrails separated from it and
went hunting.</p>

<p>All penanggalans have a similar origin: women who make dark pacts for immortal
beauty and try to renege, but who die before completing their penance and
freeing their souls. The creatures share some superficial similarities to
vampires, in that they’re undead monsters who feed on the living. Some embrace
their new nature, some keep trying to complete their atonement to perhaps find a
cure, but all of them are afflicted by a powerful hunger for the purity that
once rain in their veins. Even a penitent penanggalan can only resist this
hunger for about three days before going berserk, so atonement is really hard
for them.</p>

<p>The book doesn’t go into details on how they feed, but from what I see in
Wikipedia the original legend does say they drink blood. You could interpret the
book’s information to say they eat flesh instead. In either case their attacks
are quite fatal because even the traditional blood drinker version spreads a
wasting disease to its victims.</p>

<p>As long as a penanggalan’s original body is in good condition, she can squeeze
back into it and disguise herself as a mortal woman. The creatures often look
for jobs as midwives or nursemaids, making victims of young kids and their
mothers. Others prefer seduction as a means to get potential victims alone with
them in a private spot. The original legend also has this really neat (and
gross) detail that the creature bathes its dangling entrails in vinegar to
shrink them up and fit them through the body’s neck, but that’s not necessary in
the D&amp;D version.</p>

<p>If a penanggalan’s body is destroyed, the creature is forever stuck as a
floating head, and usually becomes a lot more desperate and obvious in its
attacks.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Penanggalans are Natural Humanoids with the Undead tag. Individuals with bodies
are Medium while in mortal form. The floating head with trailing guts is Small.</p>

<p>As undead they’re immune to disease and poison, resist necrotic damage, and are
vulnerable to radiant damage. They have darkvision and a ground speed of 6, as
well as a flight speed of 8 in head form.</p>

<h3 id="penanggalan">Penanggalan</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 10 Elite Lurker with 162 HP. It has the Shapechanger
tag and can switch between woman and head forms.</p>

<p>In woman form, the penanggalan can defend herself with a <strong>dagger</strong>, but she’s
likely in disguise and will try to use her <strong>soothing voice</strong> to literally lull
her victims into a false sense of security. This is an encounter spell that
attacks the Will of everyone in a Close Burst 1, and while it does no damage it
slows on a hit (save ends). After the first failed save, this worsens to
unconsciousness!</p>

<p>I would say that Soothing Voice can be disguised as a song or conversation,
since it’s supposed to be subtle. Targets might not notice something is wrong at
first.</p>

<p>Once the jig is up, the penanggalan undergoes her <strong>Horrific Transformation</strong>,
which is so gross it works as a Close Burst 2 attack vs. Will, dealing heavy
psychic damage and dazing for a turn on a hit. This of course transforms the
monster into its head form. The body is considered a corpse for game purposes,
and the penanggalan can return to it with a standard action if it’s on the same
space and the body is not completely destroyed.</p>

<p>In head form, the monster attacks with <strong>Bites</strong> that do physical damage and
ongoing poison damage (save ends). It can also use its <strong>Grasping Entrails</strong>
(recharge 4+) to attack up to two creatures at Reach 2. On a hit, this deals
poison and necrotic damage and grabs the victim (escape DC 22). Targets grant
combat advantage until they escape, and are exposed to Blistering Corruption
(see below).</p>

<p>The penanggalan can use its <strong>Maleable Form</strong> as a standard action to gain
phasing for a turn and shift up to its speed. If it starts its next turn hidden
from all enemies, Graping Entrails recharges, and the monster can use both it
and Bite in the same action when it next attacks.</p>

<h3 id="penanggalan-bodiless-head">Penanggalan Bodiless Head</h3>

<p>A penanggalan who had its body destroyed a while ago and had to adapt to
survive. It’s a Level 9 Skirmisher with 94 HP.</p>

<p>This monster attacks with <strong>bites</strong> that do physical damage, and also slow (save
ends) if the target is granting combat advantage. It can also use its <strong>flailing
entrails</strong> to deal poison damage and slide 1 square on a hit.</p>

<p>The penanggalan can perform a <strong>malleable rush</strong> with its move action, gaining
phasing for a turn and shifting its speed. This recharges after it’s first
bloodied. When it dies, it explodes, and the resulting <strong>Death Burst</strong> attacks a
Close Burst 1, deals poison damage, and exposes victims to Blistering
Corruption.</p>

<h3 id="penanggalan-head-swarm">Penanggalan Head Swarm</h3>

<p>Exactly what it sounds like, a pack of floating, starving penanggalan
heads. It’s a Medium Swarm of Small creatures, and a Level 8 Soldier with 87 HP.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura (1) slows enemies caught inside. Its basic attack is a
<strong>Swarm of Entrails</strong> that targets a Close Burst 2, deals light poison damage
(or more if the target is slowed), and slides the target 1 square to a space
adjacent to the monster.</p>

<h3 id="blistering-corruption">Blistering Corruption</h3>

<p>Turns out this version of the penanggalan also spreads a wasting
disease. Blistering Corruption is like supernaturally-boosted measles or
chickenpox, causing sores, blisters and boils to erupt all over the victim’s
body. You get exposed to it through contact with penanggalan entrails, and must
succeed on a save to avoid contracting it as usual.</p>

<p>This level 10 disease is resisted with Endurance, and has a Maintain DC of 13
and an Improve DC of 18. Its effects are cumulative. At Stage 1, it inflicts a
-2 penalty to Fortitude. At Stage 2 it also halves your maximum HP (making you
permanently bloodied) and healing surge value. At Stage 3, you gain an aura 2
that cannot be deactivated, and eats a healing surge from any creature that gets
caught inside.</p>

<p>As with other diseases, you stop making recovery rolls once you hit
stage 3. Blistering Corruption doesn’t kill you, but it makes you weak and
unbearable to be around. Only Remove Affliction or equivalent powers can save
you from this fate once you hit Stage 3.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>D&amp;D’s penanggalan is surprisingly similar to the traditional story I saw on
Wikipedia. The story has somewhat more varied origins for the creature, though
the “woman who practiced evil magic and was cursed by it” is also there.</p>

<p>Way back in the olden days of 2017, I published a post presenting the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/17/dfrpg-warforged.html">Warforged</a> of D&amp;D and Eberron fame as a racial template for the Dungeon
Fantasy RPG. I’m still particularly proud of that post, and have used it in
actual play, but I also think I can expand upon it a bit now. So here’s a couple
variant warforged templates.</p>

<p>In this <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/18/peoples-of-tamriel.html">2018 post</a> where I explained how I came up with the stats for the
peoples of Tamriel, I mentioned that I’m no longer a fan of including attribute
adjustments and mental or cultural disadvantages in GURPS racial templates. The
original 2017 Warforged template still includes both, even though it’s a bit
more restrained with them. So our first variant is an updated template that
removes those adjustments. It ends up being cheaper! Our second variant adds a
lens on top of that.</p>

<h2 id="warforged-20-points">Warforged (20 points)</h2>

<p>All of the story-related descriptions remain the same as in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/17/dfrpg-warforged.html">original
post</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Composite Plating 1 {5}; Doesn’t Breathe {20}; Doesn’t Eat or
Drink {10}; Unsleeping Watcher {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Dependency (Mana, Constantly) {-25}.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/17/dfrpg-warforged.html">original post</a>, Composite Plating is simply DR 1 without
the Though Skin limitation, and Unsleeping Watcher is Less Sleep 4 with a +25%
enhancement that allows the character to remain conscious during their sleep
period. Check out the link for more flavorful and detailed descriptions.</p>

<h3 id="lens-dreaming-doll--2-points">Lens: Dreaming Doll (-2 points)</h3>

<figure class="center">

  <figcaption><a
  href="https://www.deviantart.com/enijoi/art/Plain-Doll-634134454">

</figure>

<p>This lens represent living constructs that do require actual sleep, though they
still require less of it than us fleshbags. This replaces Unsleeping Watcher {10}
with standard Less Sleep 4 {8}. The character is not aware of their surroundings
when sleeping, but they are capable of dreaming.</p>

<p>This is an interesting lens if you want a character who resembles the Doll from
Bloodborne more than a standard Eberron warforged.</p>

<h2 id="warforged-gifts">Warforged Gifts</h2>

<p>These optional traits are available to any warforged. They are individual rather
than racial traits.</p>

<p>The optional traits from the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/17/dfrpg-warforged.html">original article</a> remain options
here, and are still good to represent the social awkwardness of recently
activated individuals.</p>

<p>Warforged with access to the proper tools could spend 5 points/level to increase
their innate DR up to 3. The same tools might allow them to change their outward
appearance and presentation in ways that let them acquire levels in the
Appearance advantage.</p>

<p>Characters wanting more protection might buy the Accessory (Armor Hardpoints)
perk for 1 point. This lets them use custom armor that weights 25% less than the
normal humanoid version, but can’t be used by others or removed on the
fly. Attaching or removing this custom armor can only be done in town. It costs
the same as the normal equivalent. Warforged with the perk can still choose to
wear normal armor, but can’t wear normal and attached armor together on the same
location.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This was the first time I saw these monsters, but it looks like they first
appeared in Heart of Nightfang Spire, one of the modules in the official Third
Edition adventure path.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Mooncalves are creatures native to the Far Realm with innate dimensional travel
powers. They look like giant bat-winged eyeless squids. Their life cycle is a
mystery, but it seems to include regular trips to the middle world, where they
spend a few weeks nesting at the top of a mountain or hill, hunting by night and
resting by day. The Nentir Vale has a lot of mountains and hills, so they often
end up there.</p>

<p>These creatures travel in groups of 2-5 individuals known as “grasps”, and
arrive at the middle world roughly every 8 years. They’re not picky about their
food and will hunt whatever is available. They do like the flesh of humanoids
and their cattle, so if “what’s available” is a village that place will be in
serious trouble while the incursion lasts, and might end up getting abandoned or
decimated.</p>

<p>Nerathi sages knew how to predict mooncalf incursions with great accuracy, but
the knowledge has been lost. All that’s left are the stories of past
incursions. Of how Hammerfast was once tormented by a single individual of
prodigious size and appetite, or how a hunter was accidentally saved from being
eaten by a manticore when a mooncalf appeared and ate the beast instead.</p>

<p>The most popular mooncalf vacation spot, however, is Thunderspire. The things
just love the permanent storm at its top, and descend from it to hunt in the
surrounding region.</p>

<p>These creatures are intelligent but alien. They can communicate via telepathy
but only those who know Deep Speech can even begin to understand their thought
patterns. What they can understand ends up being mostly about killing and
eating. They will definitely talk to each other and set up clever ambushes for
prey, however, using psychic powers to lure their victims into the reach of
their tentacles, or to conjure small localized storms.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Mooncalves are Large Aberrant Magical Beasts, with Resistance to Lightning and
Thunder 10. They also have Darkvision, so I guess they’re not eyeless after
all. Their ground speed is 6 and their flight speed is 8.</p>

<p>Their signature trait is <strong>Tentacle Snare</strong>, which lets them pull all grabbed
creatures with them when moving.</p>

<h3 id="mooncalf">Mooncalf</h3>

<p>The base model, who makes up those grasps of 2-5. It’s a Level 10 Controller
with 112 HP.</p>

<p>The mooncalf’s basic attack is a Reach 4 <strong>tentacle rake</strong>, and it can use
<strong>Tentacle Grab</strong> to do a little less damage and grab the victim. The monster
can have up to 2 grabbed victims, and can release a victim as a free
action. The escape DC is 18, and grabbed victims take 5 ongoing damage while the
grab lasts.</p>

<p>These tentacle attacks can’t target victims who are already grabbed. Instead,
the mooncalf can use <strong>Vile Bite</strong> on them, which deal physical damage and
prevent the target from spending healing surges for a turn.</p>

<p>The mooncalf’s psychic powers are both minor actions. <strong>Lure</strong> is a ranged
attack that targets Will and pulls the target up to 5 squares on a
hit. <strong>Stormwrack</strong> is an encounter power that creates a fireball-sized zone
which deals 10 lightning and thunder damage to anyone caught inside. It lasts a
turn but can be sustained with further minor actions.</p>

<h3 id="mooncalf-harvester">Mooncalf Harvester</h3>

<p>Rarely, a mooncalf will present a peculiar mutation that gives it teleportation
powers instead of weather control. Harvesters are Level 10 Skirmishers with 107
HP.</p>

<p>Their physical abilities are all identical to the base model, but instead of
Lure and Stormwrack they have <strong>Teleport</strong>, an encounter power that lets them
teleport 10 squares and take all grabbed victims with them.</p>

<h3 id="mooncalf-sire">Mooncalf Sire</h3>

<p>A mooncalf that managed to grow to a prodigious size and spawn progeny. It will
usually be found in the company of that progeny, a group of three or so standard
mooncalves.</p>

<p>Sires are Huge in size, and are Level 12 Elite Controllers with 262 HP. They
have the same physical attacks as a standard specimen: Tentacle Rake, Tentacle
Grab, and Vile Bite. The main different is that they are Reach 6 instead of 4,
and are generally more effective due to the beast’s higher level. The sire can
use <strong>Double Attack</strong> to perform any combination of two of these attacks with
one standard action.</p>

<p>Sires also have Lure, and their weather control abilities take the form of two
different encounter powers. <strong>Call Lightning</strong> is an attack that targets enemies
in a Close Blast 5, does lightning damage and slows for a turn. <strong>Fury of the
Storm</strong> is an interrupt that triggers when the sire is bloodied, and causes it
to project an aura (1) that deals 10 lightning and thunder damage to enemies
caught inside. This lasts for the rest of the encounter.</p>

<h3 id="mooncalf-rogue">Mooncalf Rogue</h3>

<p>Sometimes, a mooncalf is separated from its kin. These loners might team up with
other creatures capable of understanding them, such other aberrant monsters or
mortal spellcasters with strong connections to the Far Realm. These use standard
stat blocks. A rogue is something else.</p>

<p>Mooncalf rogues are outcasts among their kind and are adamant in their desire to
remain alone. They attack even other mooncalves who trespass upon their
territories. The isolation, or perhaps something they do to themselves, causes
them to grow far beyond the size of a standard mooncalf, and to develop powers
not seen among those more gregarious individuals.</p>

<p>These creatures are also Huge in size, and are Level 15 Solo Soldiers with 620
HP. They have two additional traits: <strong>Psychic Veil</strong> makes them invisible to
creatures more than 6 squares away from it, and <strong>Superior Brain</strong> ends any
dazing or stunning effects on them at the start of their turn.</p>

<p>Their Tentacle Rake is upgraded to a <strong>Tentacle Slam</strong> that also knocks prone on
a hit. The other two attacks are the same, with bigger damage and Reach 6
instead of 4. <strong>Multiattack</strong> lets the rogue perform three melee attacks against
different targets with the same action.</p>

<p>They can call up a <strong>Windwrack</strong> aura as a minor action (recharge 5+). This
lasts a turn, prevents any creatures inside from shifting, and knocks them prone
if they end their turns inside. If an enemy escapes the rogue’s grab, it can
react with a <strong>Tentacle Flurry</strong> that lets it attack every enemy in a Close
Burst 1.</p>

<p>If you can see this thing at all, it can reach you with its tentacles. I guess
they would typically try to grab a couple of PCs and fly away to eat in peace,
but it’s also excellent at playing a more traditional soldier role and
protecting squishy artillery from PCs.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Delightfully weird and horrific, and an excellent out-of-context problem to
throw at the PCs when they’re busy dealing with something else. They go
somewhere to face a more mundane threat, and suddenly discover it’s mooncalf
season.</p>

<p>Rogues work very well as the Thing From Beyond that a Far Realm cult might be
trying to summon. They’re threats on par with an adult dragon or a titan, but
are completely impervious to negotiation.</p>
