<p>I remember reading a few play reports about a campaign titled “Mecha Against the
Giants” a few years ago. It was run by Mark Langsdorf, using GURPS as a rule
system, and it was vaguely inspired by the Agains the Giants modules for AD&amp;D.</p>

<p>One of these days, I really want to run something like that using LANCER. As of
this writing I definitely don’t have the bandwidth for it, but I just thought it
would be nice to write it down.</p>

<h2 id="lancer-against-the-giants">LANCER: Against the Giants</h2>

<p>Armies of Giants invade, out of nowhere and for seemingly no reason!</p>

<p>Their relentless assaults threaten to destroy “smallfolk” civilization!</p>

<p>The realm’s bravest heroes have fallen against their foe’s overwhelming strength
and numbers!</p>

<p>Desperate, the King’s wizards and priests spend the last of their power in a
rituat. It purpose: to summon someone, <em>anyone</em> from across the vastness of
existance that has the power to stop the destruction!</p>

<p>They succeed in bringing the 2021st Union Auxiliary Squadron. Your squadron.</p>

<p>Mount up, Lancer, and end this war!</p>

<p>Fight off attacking giants and their pet giant monsters!</p>

<p>Discover the mystery behind these invasions!</p>

<p>Find a way to end this war that <em>doesn’t</em> involve genocide, because we’re better
than Gygax!</p>

<p>And finally, at the end of it all…</p>

<p><strong>ATTACK AND DETHRONE LOLTH</strong>.</p>
