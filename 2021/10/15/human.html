    <p>As we saw in the Monster Manual Let’s Read, Fourth Edition makes the usual D&amp;D
human description a little more specific. They’re the mortal people without a
patron deity, which makes their outlooks on life very varied and leaves extra
room in their hearts that can be filled with extreme dedication to any number of
causes. Therefore, humans can produce some of the world’s greatest heroes as
well as its most depraved villains.</p>

<p>This MM2 entry brings us a huge grab bag of human stat blocks. Most of them are
the usual Unaligned people that can be repurposed as either allies or enemies,
but a few are Evil or Chaotic Evil and meant to always be used as threats.</p>

<p>Numbers-wise, they have absolutely no common traits beyond being Medium Natural
Humanoids with a ground speed of 6. You can easily take a human stat block and
make it into a member of another species by adding the relevant signature
ability to them (Goblin Tactics, Elven Accuracy, Savage Demise, Fey Step…).</p>

<h2 id="human-cavalier">Human Cavalier</h2>

<p>An armored knight that fights with lance and sword. It’s highly recommended that
you give them a mount when building your encounters, though they can give a good
account of themselves on foot as well. Horses and griffons are the most common
cavalier mounts.</p>

<p>The Cavalier is a Level 7 Soldier (Leader) with 78 HP. Their basic attack is a
<strong>sword</strong> strike that damages and marks on a hit, and they can exploit the mark
with two different interrupt abilities. <strong>Champion’s Retort</strong> is at-will and
allows the knight to make a slightly weaker attack against a marked enemy who
decides to ignore the mark. <strong>Hasty Parry</strong> is an encounter power that forces
the enemy to target the knight instead, and gives the knight a +3 AC bonus
against that attack.</p>

<p>When mounted, the knight can also attack with a <strong>Lance</strong> that damages and
knocks prone on a hit. The text doesn’t say it can be used as part of a charge,
but it really should have this ability.</p>

<h2 id="human-diabolist">Human Diabolist</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-human-diabolist.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A warlock-type who’s in tight with the forces of Hell, and wields
fire-and-brimstone themed magic to achieve their Evil ends.</p>

<p>The diabolist is Level 20 Artillery with 147 HP, powerful enough to be
encountered alongside groups of high-end devils. Their main weapon and implement
is a <strong>kukri</strong> that does a mix of physical and fire damage. Like all attacks in
this book it needs a damage boost, but make sure its roll is still a fistful of
d6s because this attack has the Brutal property. This means you re-roll any dice
that show a 1 until they show something else.</p>

<p>Their attack magic is all about <strong>Darkfire</strong>, in an “at-will single-target” and
“area encounter power” versions. It does fire and necrotic damage, and the area
version also does ongoing fire and necrotic damage (save ends).</p>

<p>For enemies who get a bit closer, the diabolist can use a <strong>Sulfurous Flash</strong>
attack that deals fire damage and gives the caster concealment against the
target until the end of the caster’s next turn. If attacked, the diabolist can
use <strong>Infernal Deflection</strong> (recharge 5+) as an interrupt to take half damage
from the attack and deal an automatic 15 fire damage to the attacker.</p>

<p>All of these attacks can be enhanced by <strong>Hell Blight</strong>, a minor action that
automatically makes an enemy in sight “blighted”. If a blighted enemy takes fire
damage from the diabolist, they can’t recover HP until the end of the
diabolist’s next turn. The blight ends when the fight does, or when the
diabolist blights someone else. This makes focusing their fire on a sincle PC at
a time a very effective tactic.</p>

<p>Finally, the <strong>Life From Fire</strong> passive trait gives the diabolist 10 temporary
HP whenever they take fire damage from any source.</p>

<h2 id="human-dire-beast-hunter">Human Dire Beast Hunter</h2>

<p>Someone has to protect all those scattered villages if no PCs are around to
help! This hunter is Level 9 Artillery with 76 HP, wielding a spear, a crossbow
with poisoned bolts, and a net.</p>

<p>The <strong>net</strong> is a Ranged 3 attack that does no damage and restrains (save
ends). The <strong>crossbow</strong> has good range and its bolts have an ongoing poison
damage (save ends) rider. The <strong>spear</strong> is there for emergencies, because its
best to hunt dire beasts from a distance.</p>

<p>The hunter is not meant to be alone. It should be encountered either as part of
a sizable NPC hunting party, or attached to the PCs as an ally for a
particularly tough hunt.</p>

<h2 id="human-dread-assassin">Human Dread Assassin</h2>

<p>An epic-level assassin armed with a dreadful sword and with spells of poison and
darkness. The perfect person for the job when that job is to kill a king or
emperor. Though they’re unaligned, their clientele is unlikely to be very nice.</p>

<p>The assassin is a Level 22 Lurker with 161 HP and a speed of 7. Their <strong>Zealot’s
Scimitar</strong> is a High-Crit weapon that also deals ongoing poison and necrotic
damage (save ends). They can use a power named <strong>Cloak of Zeal</strong> as a move
action to shift 3 squares and gain concealment until the end of their next
turn.</p>

<p>While the assassin has cover or concealment, they can use <strong>Deadly Blade</strong>
(recharge 5+) as a minor action to make is so their next attack has combat
advantage and deals 5d6 extra damage on a hit. And finally, <strong>Assassin’s
Determination</strong> triggers when they’re bloodied and either immediately recharges
Deadly Blade or (if it’s charged already) heals them for 20 HP.</p>

<p>I guess the idea is that this is a deadly foe that will never stop trying to
kill you until they succeed, but you should really boost their damage for that
to be true. Also, since they’re regulars you should expect these epic ninjas to
team up with either other assassins, or with some distracting heavies.</p>

<h2 id="human-gladiator">Human Gladiator</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-human-gladiator.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This gladiator is described by the book as a “consumate athlete”, which isn’t
really the term I’d use to refer to someone forced to fight in deathmatches for
the amusement of a bloodthirsty crowd. Still, some of them might end up
becomming bloodsport celebrities, and this one is powerful enough to fit that
role.</p>

<p>This particular individual is a Level 14 Elite Soldier with 276 HP, so we’re
either looking at a Spartacus in the making or at the reigning champion of the
arena that must be taken down before the revolt can start. He wears armor
equivalent to scale and carries a light shield and a gladius.</p>

<p>The gladiator has a <strong>Fighting Focus</strong> aura (1) that marks enemies who start
their turns inside, lasting until the start of their next turns. It’s a lot like
the Essential Knight’s Defender Aura, with a bit more stickiness.</p>

<p>That <strong>gladius</strong> can be used to make melee basic attacks, and in a <strong>Gladius
Display</strong> that attacks a Close Burst 1 and does the same damage. This is
supplemented by a variety of dirty tricks. They’re all minor actions, and though
none of them do damage they inflict a variety of conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Knock to the Dirt</strong> is an encounter power that targets Fortitude and knocks
prone; <strong>Sand in the Eyes</strong> is another encounter power that targets fortitude,
and causes blindness (save ends). <strong>Well-Placed Kick</strong> is recharge 5+, targets
Reflex, and both slows and dazes the target (save ends). I bet it targets
the… knee. Yeah, that’d do it.</p>

<p>That’s the sort of fighting style that’d mark you as a heel in wrestling, but
since the gladiator fights in actual life or death matches I’d say it’s just
good sense.</p>

<h2 id="human-hexer">Human Hexer</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-human-hexer.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Perfect for playing the part of a sinister witch or a seer whose dire prophecies
go unheard. The hexer is a Level 7 Controller with 77 HP, wearing robes and
wielding a staff.</p>

<p>The hexer is extremely weak in terms of damage, and is meant to be used
alongside monsters who are better in that area. They have some interesting
control options, though.</p>

<p>Their only melee attack is a weak bonk with the <strong>staff</strong>, but insted of
bothering with it they’re going to stay away and open up with <strong>Hex</strong>, a minor
action that targets all enemies in a Close Burst 10. That’s guaranteed to cover
all PCs unless one of them is a sniper ranger or something. It’s an attack
against Will, and a hit means the target is <em>hexed</em>. Hexed targets have a -2
penalty to damage the hexer, and become valid targets for the hexer’s other
spells.</p>

<p>One of them is <strong>Capricious Earth</strong> (encounter), a big area burst that targets
Will, does a bit of damage, slides targets 3 squares, and knocks them prone.</p>

<p>The other one is <strong>Beast Curse</strong> (recharge 4+), a ranged spell that targets
Fortitude and turns the target into a Tiny creature until the end of the hexer’s
next turn. While in this state the target cannot use powers. Yes, this <em>does</em>
include basic attacks, so your Slayer won’t turn into a surprisingly deadly
frog.</p>

<h2 id="human-insane-noble">Human Insane Noble</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-human-insane-noble.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Not to be confused with the standard Human Noble, shown later. The picture is
pretty much a caricature of Carlota Joaquina, a historical figure who was rather
unpleasant but not epic-level.</p>

<p>The Insane Noble wears finery and wields a scepter, but as a Level 23 Elite
Skirmisher it doesn’t need much more than that to ruin your day. <strong>Sheer
Madness</strong> makes them immune to opportunity attacks. The <strong>scepter</strong> is a basic
attack, and <strong>Flurry of Madness</strong> allows the noble to shift 6 squares and make a
scepter attack against every enemy they pass by during the shift. These traits
and abilities combine to make them a combatant that never stands still,
scuttling about the battlefield with alarming alacrity.</p>

<p>When the noble is first bloodied, <strong>Ignoble Fury</strong> triggers and lets them bonk
everyone in a Close Burst 1 with a scepter attack that also knocks targets prone
on a hit.</p>

<h2 id="human-javelin-dancer">Human Javelin Dancer</h2>

<p>A specialized martial artist, lightly armored and wielding a spear for close
combat and a brace of javelins for range. Their <strong>Skirmisher</strong> trait allows them
to do increased damage if they move at least 4 squares before attacking, and
<strong>Adept Retreat</strong> makes them not grant combat advantage when running. “Running”
is something everyone can do, greatly increasing their Move at the cost of
granting combat advantage. That’s what the dancer ignores.</p>

<p>In addition to basic attacks with the <strong>spear</strong> or a <strong>thrown javelin</strong>, the
dancer can also make a <strong>Mobile Attack</strong> at will, shifting 3 squares and
attacking with the spear.</p>

<h2 id="human-knife-fighter">Human Knife Fighter</h2>

<p>Knife fighters are rogue-types that are much more focused on acrobatic stabbing
than on other types of crime, which makes them quite similar to PC rogues when
you think about it. They also do well in the role of a knife-focused martial
artist, or the classic super-dangerous lieutenant for a criminal gang whose
actual boss isn’t a fighter.</p>

<p>This knife fighter is a Level 7 Elite Skirmisher with 162 HP. They go unarmored
(which doesn’t affect their defenses, since they’re all based on level), and are
equipped with a dagger and a net.</p>

<p>The net is probably a typo, since none of the fighter’s abilities use it, but
the knife is a <strong>Wounding Dagger</strong> with an ongoing damage rider and the
High-Crit property. It can also be used in an attack named <strong>Dance of the
Knife</strong>, where the knife fighter makes two dagger attacks and shifts 2 squares
between them.</p>

<p>All of these attacks deal extra damage when they have combat advantage, and they
can also use <strong>Peerless Tumbler</strong> (recharge 5+) to shift 4 squares while
ignoring difficult terrain.</p>

<p>Very skirmishery, and goes very well with a pack of soldier monsters with
marking and punishing abilities.</p>

<h2 id="human-mystagogue">Human Mystagogue</h2>

<p>A divine spellcaster who delves into divine mysteries few mortals can
understand. Their magic focuses a lot on mind- and perception-affecting
effects.</p>

<p>Mystagogues are Level 20 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 188 HP. They
wear robes and carry a holy symbol - all of their attacks are magic.</p>

<p>The basic melee attack is <strong>Mystery’s Touch</strong> (vs. Reflex), which deals psychic
damage and inflicts a -2 penalty to attack the mystagogue until the end if their
next turn. At range they use <strong>Bend Perception</strong> (ranged 20 vs. Will), which
deals psychic damage, slows, and inflicts a -2 penalty to all attacks and saves
until the end of the mystagogue’s next turn.</p>

<p>Their special attack is <strong>Awestrike</strong> (close burst 5 vs will), which does the
same damage as Bend Perception to all it hits, and also slides the targets 6
squares and dazes them (save ends). The mystagogue also chooses one ally in the
area to slide 6 squares and heal for 10 HP.</p>

<p>Finally, the mystagogue can use a <strong>Veil of Inscrutability</strong> as a reaction to
being hit by a melee or ranged attack. This allows them to shift 2 squares and
gain a +2 bonus to AC and Reflex for a turn.</p>

<p>As opposition, mystagogues pair well with enemies who can exploit combat
advantage or (save ends) effects.</p>

<h2 id="human-noble">Human Noble</h2>

<p>Not to be confused with the Insane Noble from a few entries ago. This type of
noble can still be pretty horrible, but not the “epic-level scuttling nightmare”
kind of horrible. They’re Level 5 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 60 HP.</p>

<p>The Noble wears mail and wields a longsword and a light shield. Their <strong>sword</strong>
strikes are nothing special, and their actual superpower is ordering people
around. It’s very much meant to be encountered alongside its bodyguard detail,
which will be made up of more competent fighters. In other words, this is the
NPC version of the Lazy Warlord.</p>

<p>The noble is <strong>Protected</strong> by their allies, and gains a +2 to all defenses when
adjacent to at least one of them. <strong>Appoint Champion</strong> is an at-will order that
allows an ally to make a basic attack and shift 1 square before or after
it. <strong>Inspirational Authority</strong> is an encounter power that allows one of those
allies to use any of their attacks as a free action.</p>

<p>The noble can also order <em>enemies</em> around. <strong>Urge Hesitation</strong> is an attack
against Will that, on a hit, prevents the target from using a standard action in
its next turn.</p>

<h2 id="human-pirate">Human Pirate</h2>

<p>Yarrr! Pirates are Level 9 Skirmishers with 95 HP, armed with cutlasses. They’re
pretty fast, with a Speed of 7 and a <strong>Rigging Monkey</strong> ability that gives them
a climb speed of 7 for a turn once per encounter.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Cutlass</strong> strike with no additional riders, but
they’re extra-good at flanking: <strong>Scurvy Dog’s Flank</strong> gives them an extra +1 to
hit and +2d6 bonus damage to all attacks against a flanked target. This stacks
with combat advantage for a total of +3 to hit.</p>

<p>Their tactics section says they like to stay near the water or near the edge of
the boat if this is a boarding action, but I see no reason for this.</p>

<h2 id="human-pirate-captain">Human Pirate Captain</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-human-pirate-captain.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Double Yarrr! The captain is a Level 10 Soldier with the Leader keyword and 104
HP. It’s clearly meant to be used alongside a bunch of Pirates and perhaps a
small horde of minions.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Cutlass</strong> attacks have a slow (save ends) rider, and they have the same
Rigging Monkey and Scurvy Dog’s Flank abilities as the rest of the
crew. Captains complement their swordplay with occasional bouts of <strong>Vicious
Mockery</strong> (minor action; recharge 6+). This doesn’t require an attack roll and
causes a nearby enemy to provoke an opportunity attack from one of the captain’s
allies. When first bloodied, they shout out a <strong>Call to Arms</strong> that allows all
allies within 10 squares to make a basic melee attack or shift 3 squares as a
free action.</p>

<h2 id="human-slaver">Human Slaver</h2>

<p>One of the few explicitly Evil stat blocks in this entry, the slaver is an
unpleasant villain that fights with a mace and a scourge. Their focus is on
immobilizing enemies for capture, and on inflicting pain. They’re level 8 Brutes
with 102 HP.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is <strong>Thump and Lash</strong>, which deals damage and inflicts a -2
attack penalty for a turn. They can also use the scourge to perform a <strong>Slaver’s
Tangle</strong> maneuver (recharge 4+) that does all of the above and also immobilizes
for a turn.</p>

<p>Slavers are meant to be use as part of larger capture teams featuring one or
more of them plus an assortment of other goons.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Between the first Monster Manual, the Vault, and the MM2, you have enough human
stat blocks that you can include one or more of them in any encounter that
demands sapient humanoid opposition. The PCs themselves are proof that humans
work well with members of any other sapient species that share their individual
goals.</p>

<p>These “generic” stat blocks also work as seasoning for more specialized groups,
like cultists. It might surprise the PCs a bit if the guy holding the
sacrificial dagger is an elite knife-fighter instead of a squishy caster, for
example.</p>
