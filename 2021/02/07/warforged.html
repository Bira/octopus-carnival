<p>Warforged are a 3e creation, first appearing as a playable option in the Eberron
campaign setting. In 4e they would also become playable characters, but their
first appearance was in the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The warforged lore given to us by the Monster Manual has been stripped of all
Eberron-specific information, which means it’s extremely terse and generic.</p>

<p>Warforged are living constructs created by magic. The “living” part means
they’re gifted with true sapience, and with souls. It also means they’re a
little less tough than a golem, but they make up for that with their large
numbers.</p>

<p>Warforged are created in magical factories called Creation Forges. They’re
sexless and can’t reproduce in any other way. As their name implies, the
original purpose of the warforged was to serve as an army. In peacetime,
individual warforged often end up working as bodyguards and mercenaries for
people who share their individual ideals and disposition.</p>

<p>In Eberron, the secret of building and operating creation forges belonged
exclusively to House Cannith, who sold warforged armies to all five sides of the
Last War but whose main customer was the nation of Cyre. The treaty that ended
the War (signed after Cyre got swallowed by a magical disaster) freed all
existing warforged from servitude, and I think it also tightly regulated their
creation.</p>

<p>Most warforged PCs from Eberron are going to be veterans of the Last War, which
is like a combination between our Hundred Years War and World War One. However,
in the ruins of Cyre, a powerful warforged supremacist named the Lord of Blades
controls a fully working creation forge and is using it to build an army.</p>

<p>Warforged in the 4e implied setting might have been alive to see the fall of
Nerath. They could also have been built more recently by someone operating an
Nerathian creation forge, or even assembled by hand by an isolated artificer.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Warforged are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Living Construct
keyword. Monster Manual warforged have several signature traits: they get a +2
to saves against ongoing damage, they employ <strong>Battlefield Tactics</strong> that grant
them a +1 bonus to melee attack if any ally is adjacen to the target, and they
can use the <strong>Warforged Resolve</strong> encounter power as a minor action when
bloodied to recover a healing surge’s worth of HP.</p>

<p>Playable Warforged would appear in the Eberron Player’s Guide: they’d get the
save bonus against ongoing damage and a modified form of <strong>Warforged Resolve</strong>,
along with a few other things.</p>

<h3 id="warforged-soldier">Warforged Soldier</h3>

<p>This is a Level 4 Soldier with 56 HP and all standard warforged traits. It wears
plate, and wields a longsword and a shield. Its ground speed is 5, and it’s
trained in Endurance and Intimidate.</p>

<p>The soldier’s basic (and only) attack is the <strong>longsword</strong>, which does average
damage for its level and marks for a turn. Its <strong>Warforged Resolve</strong> heals it
for 14 HP when used.</p>

<p>The warforged isn’t too different from a human fighter, but its racial traits
give significantly more staying power. You can slap them onto any human stat
block to get the warforged version. If you use them in a tight formation then
most of them will get the +1 Battlefield Tactics bonus all the time when
attacking targets directly in front of the formation.</p>

<h3 id="warforged-captain">Warforged Captain</h3>

<p>This is a Level 6 Soldier (Leader) with 72 HP and all common warforged
traits. Its speed is 5 due to armor and its Warforged Resolve heals it for 18 HP
when used.</p>

<p>Captains fight with a Reach 2 <strong>glaive</strong>, which does average damage and marks for a
turn. It can use this weapon to performa <strong>Tactical Switch</strong> maneuver (recharge
4-6), in which it makes a basic attack that also slides the target 1 square. If
this hits, the captain or an ally within 10 squares can also shift 1 square.</p>

<p>Captains excel at fighting from the back row of that warforged soldier
formation, since they have a reach weapon. Tactical Switch is good for
disrupting enemy formations, or interrrupting flanking attempts by individual
strikers.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have a single sample encounter: Level 4, three human guards, 1 warforged
soldier, and 1 warforged captain. A mixed force that makes it look like
warforged make up the command and elite in this particular army.</p>

<p>Mechanically, these Monster Manual warforged are very simple and present little
in the way of exciting surprises other than the fact that they
will. Not. Stay. Down. If I’m being honest the book might have done without them
entirely.</p>

<p>However, I absolutely love the <em>concept</em> of warforged, both as player characters
and as NPCs. I love them so much I adapted them to GURPS <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/17/dfrpg-warforged.html">here</a>. I understand
why the first MM included these: the Eberron books were still a little ways
away, and the authors might have felt its fans needed a little reassurance.</p>
