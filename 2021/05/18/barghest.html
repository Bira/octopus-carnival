<p>I think Barghests have been in the game since AD&amp;D 1st Edition, though I don’t
think I have the book in which they first appear. Their exact nature has changed
a bit between editions.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>If you described a barghest as a “goblin werewolf”, you’d get the general idea
across while being almost completely wrong.</p>

<p>Barghests are born randomly in goblinoid populations. The event is rare, and
usually seen as a blessing from Bane. As a result of this reputation and their
own powers, barghests often rise to leadership positions in goblinoid society
when they grow up.</p>

<p>Barghests are shapeshifters, and possess two forms: one is a goblinoid (goblin,
hobgoblin or bugbear), and the other a wolf-like creature. You can’t really
mistake them for either normal goblinoids or wolves, though: the creature is
merely <em>wolf-like</em>, and the other form always has a specific tell that remains
constant across forms. Locks of white hair or a single discolored eye are
common.</p>

<p>Barghests aren’t particularly vulnerable to silver nor are they affected by the
moon. They’re fairly smart and in full control of their actions in all
forms. And they have psionic powers, which usually manifest as some sort of
psychic vampirism they use to sap the minds and vitality of their foes.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Barghests are Small or Medium Natural Humanoids with the Shapechanger
keyword. They have low-light vision and a ground speed of 6 (8 in wolf
form). They can <strong>Change Shape</strong> with a minor action once per round, and have
different basic attacks depending on what their current form is.</p>

<p>They also have some form of harmful psychic power, which varies per stat
block. We have two here, both Medium:</p>

<h3 id="barghest-savager">Barghest Savager</h3>

<p>This is a bugbear barghest whose love of violence is exceptional even for a
bugbear. As a leader, it tries to incite its troops to perform frequent raids on
any soft targets it can find.</p>

<p>Savagers are Level 4 Brutes with 63 HP. They fight with a <strong>battleaxe</strong> or with
their wolfish <strong>bites</strong>, and can perform a <strong>Jump Strike</strong> (recharge 5-6) with
either, shifting 3 squares before and after the attack and doing extra damage.</p>

<p>Their mental powers manifest as the <strong>Power Feed</strong> ability (melee 1 vs. Will;
Encounter; Reliable), usable only in wolf form. This does some psychic damage
and allows the barghest to use an encounter or daily power it has seen the
target use this encounter.</p>

<p>The attack bonus for this will be the same as that of the monster’s other
attacks, but damage and other effects will be as if the power had been used by
the original PC. This would make the ability worth using on high-damage powers,
or those with interesting side effects. When the wizard proclaimed his Sleep
spell would end the fight, this was probably not what he had in mind.</p>

<p>The Reliable keyword means the power isn’t spent if the attack misses, so odds
are the monster will be able to use this successfully at least once.</p>

<h3 id="barghest-battle-lord">Barghest Battle Lord</h3>

<p>This hobgoblin barghest has the makings of a legendary general, commanding his
troops with great tactical acumen and preferring to bait his enemies into
traps. He’s a Level 7 Controller with 82 HP, fighting with a greatsword in
humanoid form.</p>

<p>The wolf form’s <strong>bites</strong> knock the target prone on a hit, and the
<strong>greatsword</strong> makes the battle lord invisible to the target for a turn. In
either form he can use a <strong>Psychic Howl</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will) which does
psychic damage, dazes for a turn, and inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks as an
aftereffect (save ends).</p>

<p>He can also use <strong>Life Feed</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude; encounter) in wolf
form, which does a little bit of necrotic damage and inflicts 5 ongoing necrotic
damage (save ends). Whenever the targets take that ongoing damage, the battle
lord heals 5 HP. So if four PCs are hit the battle lord will heal at the start
of each of their turns, totalling 20 HP per round.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, as a reaction to being hit by a melee attack, the battle
lord can <strong>Get Some Distance</strong>, shifting 2 squares away.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Barghests can be added to any goblin encounter that you think needs an extra
kick. The first few times it happens it might catch the PCs by surprise, but it
will be interesting to find out if they learn to spot the tells. As mentioned in
the lore, barghests will usually occupy leadership positions in whatever group
of goblins they hang out with.</p>

<p>I remember barghests had an extremely complicated backstory in previous
editions, being fiends from the Neutral Evil plane who happened to be able to
shapeshift into goblins and who had a whole complicated hierarchy back home
based on how many souls they had devoured. All of that is gone here, which I
think is for the best in the end. Some goblins can just wolf out and break your
mind with their psychic powers. It’s one of those things that happens.</p>
