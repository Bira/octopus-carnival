<p>The first Monster Manual already includes a bunch of <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/18/ghost.html">ghosts</a>, and it even
has a basic Phantom Warrior. Here we have a more specific implementation of that
concept.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These creatures are the ghosts of soldiers who died in battle more or less at
the same time as the entire rest of their units. The emotional bonds between
them and the trauma of their violent massed deaths causes their spirits to fuse
and to rise as undead.</p>

<p>Legionnaires always appear as a unit, and they look like individuals acting in
concert, but they’re all part of the same collective ghost. So it might have
been more accurate to title this entry “Ghost <em>Legion</em>”. Members of the legion
can possess the living and make them experience the soldiers’ last moments.</p>

<p>When a ghost legionnaire is damaged, it always displays the wounds it suffered
in its final battle rather than the ones that were actually inflicted on it. So
a squad killed by some wizard’s acid-infused fireball would grow progressively
more burned and melted as the PC paladin stabs them.</p>

<p>A ghost legion might be endlessly reliving its last battle when found, seeing
any living intruders as their enemies. It might also be following the orders of
a more powerful undead being, particularly if that being was one of its
commanders in life.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>An individual legionnaire is a Medium Natural Humanoid with the Undead keyword,
and a Level 13 Soldier with 100 HP. Despite being a ghost, it’s not considered
insubstantial, but it has 10 necrotic resistance and isn’t especially vulnerable
to radiant damage.</p>

<p>Legionnaires fight with the same weapons they had in life, making <strong>devastating
cuts</strong> with their melee weapons or shooting <strong>ghost arrows</strong> that do necrotic
damage. They can also use their <strong>Battle Visions</strong> power to possess a
target. This has range 20, targets Will and deals psychic damage with a Dominate
(save ends) rider. While the target is dominated, the ghost is removed from the
map. When the target finally makes their save, the ghost reappears in an
adjacent space.</p>

<p>This ghost’s main weakness takes the form of a trait named <strong>Call to
History</strong>. It allows a PC to make a DC 25 History check as a minor action to
recall details about the legionnaire’s original unit. A success here makes the
PC’s next attack against that ghost deal 10 extra damage. I don’t think you can
stack multiple checks in a single attack, but you <em>can</em> make a check every turn
before you attack. Someone who was possessed and made their save has a +5 bonus
to these tests for the rest of the fight, as those horrifying battle visions act
as extra reference material.</p>

<p>The collective nature of a ghost legion is expressed by the <strong>Soul Link</strong>
trait. Basically, you combine the HP totals of all legionnaires present in the
fight into a single pool. Damage to any individual legionnaire is subtracted
from this combined pool. The whole unit is destroyed when this pool is reduced
to 0, but until that happens all legionnaires remain in the fight! This makes
the usual “focus fire” strategy considerably less effective against them.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 15, and quite straightforward: a 5-ghost unit and
a human lich wizard from the MM. A Nerathi squad plus their former commanding
officer.</p>

<p>I really like the “collective HP” gimmick! It shouldn’t be too hard to add or
subtract levels from the stat block given here, either, meaning you can bring
the Fun (TM) of ghost legions to the party no matter what their
level.</p>

<p>There isn’t much of a story difference between a ghost legionnaire and a phantom
warrior, as you can see by their names. This suggests that one way to get a
level 4 legionnaire would be to remove Insubstantial from the warrior and add
Soul Link in its place. You can likely do the same with any other thesaurus
buddies that might come along (banshee battlers, figment fighters, spectral
soldiers, wraith warriors…).</p>
