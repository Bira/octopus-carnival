<p>Cribbing from paleonthology is one of the classic ways to add interesting
monsters to your D&amp;D world. Dinosaurs are the obvious choice, but there’s also a
bunch of post-dinosaur megafauna that can be slotted in with no problem at
all. Among that set, mammoths are some of the most famous.</p>

<p>Looks like the Monster Manual 2 only had one page to dedicate to them, though,
so it decided to skip mundane mammoths altogether and give us a fantastical
variety.</p>

<h2 id="nyfellar-mammoth">Nyfellar Mammoth</h2>

<p>These creatures are native to Nyfell, the same frozen realm in the Elemental
Chaos from which frost giants originally came. They’re partially made of ice,
and subsist on a combination of organic food and ice, so they thrive in the most
inhospitable frozen hells.</p>

<p>Frost giants have long ago tamed Nyfellar mammoths for use as mounts, and were
responsible for bringing them to the world, where they can still be seen filling
that role. I imagine it’s also possible to find wild specimens.</p>

<p>Nyfellar Mammoths are Huge Elemental Beasts with the Mount keyword, and Level 17
Brutes with 202 HP. They have Resist Cold 10 and a respectable ground speed of 8
with Ice Walk, which allows them to ignore “icy” difficult terrain.</p>

<p>They also possess the same <strong>Icebound Footing</strong> trait that’s common among frost
giants, reducing any forced movement inflicted on them by 2 squares, and getting
a free save to avoid being knocked prone. They fight with their tusks and big
feet in combat.</p>

<p>The tusks are Reach 2 and can either <strong>gore</strong> as a basic attack or perform a
<strong>Tusk Toss</strong> (recharge 4+) that targets Fortitude, does a little less damage
and slides the target 5 squares. At the end of the slide the target falls from a
height of 30 feet on the destination square, so it really is a toss. The fall
does damage (and can be mitigated) according to the standard rules for falling.</p>

<p>The feet can <strong>stamp</strong>, a Reach 1 attack that targets fortitude, does about same
damage as a gore, and knocks prone. The mammoth can also execute a <strong>Blizzard
Trample</strong> maneuver to move 8 squares, go through enemy spaces, and stamp each of
those enemies. This recharges when the mammoth is bloodied, or when it takes
cold damage.</p>

<p>If used as a mount, the mammoth can employ a <strong>Bitterwind Charge</strong>, which allows
it to use a Tusk Toss <em>or a Blizzard Trample</em> when charging. Yeah, it moves 8
squares then tramples for another 8 in a single standard action. After this
special attack concludes, the rider gets to make a free melee basic attack.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is a level 17 frost giant patrol, with 2 giants riding
nyfellar mammoths and accompanied by a rimefire griffon acting as a spotter. The
book notes that giants like to play badminton with PCs by readying actions to
attack victims of Tusk Toss as they fly by.</p>

<p>These ice mammoths are pretty cool, and I can see why they preferred to include
them over the mundane variety. They have a good synergy with frost giants, which
also debut in this book.</p>

<p>You could pretty easily derive a mundane mammoth from the nyfellar stat block,
making it level 10-13 and removing some of the more blatant elemental
abilities. Maybe they could be used as hill giant or ogre mounts then.</p>
