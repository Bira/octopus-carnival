A chimera is nightmarish three-headed beast whose appearance in Gransys heralds
the coming of the Dragon. It resembles a huge lion with a giant goat's head
growing out of its back and a monstrous snake in place of its tail. All three
heads are extremely dangerous! Both the lion and the snake have very strong
bites and have large enough jaws to grapple human-sized targets, with the snake
being venomous as well. And while the goat doesn't have a large range of motion,
it can _cast spells_. This last fact is very often the last surprise any who
dare face the chimera have in their lives, and is a sign that the monster is a
lot more intelligent than its animalistic appearance would indicate. In addition
to all of this, all three heads can act independently at the same time.

As heralds to the Dragon, chimerae guard the path to it, making their lairs in
places one must cross to arrive at the Dragon's chosen nest. They can also
sometimes be found near lesser dragons as well.

GMs who use chimerae in their games are also encouraged to
include [Snake-Maned Lions][1] as either a variant chimera or a related
monster. You can never have too many freakish mutant lions in your game!

## Fighting the Chimera

Chimerae like to incapacitate targets either by grappling them with one of their
biting heads, or by magically dazing them or putting them to sleep. They will
then proceed to tear the helpless victim apart with their teeth and
claws. Despite its size, the monster is fairly mobile and smart enough to try
and avoid being surrounded. It's most vulnerable to long-ranged attacks, but
it's also smart enough to be aware of this! When faced with a large group of
opponents, a chimera might try to drag them away one at a time.

A chimera's lion and goat heads can be incapacitaded by a single attack doing
over 12 HP of injury (as if they were limbs). They each have all the hit
locations you'd expect of a head: neck, face, eyes, brain. These can be targeted
at the usual penalties. Killing a head prevents the chimera from performing the
actions associated with that head. The lion head is the beast's main head - it
dies when the whole creature dies.

## Chimera Variants:

The same variants described in the [Snake-Maned Lion][1] article are appropriate
here, with the exception of _Intelligent_ (which already applies to all
chimerae).  _Gorechimerae_ are not only both _Armored_ and _Demonic_, they also
know more spells and have higher combat skills! No one has seen one of these in
Gransys - the laws of nature would need to be completly broken for such a beast
to cross the Rift.
