Say you're a GURPS player who's inspired to make a dashing pirate, a badass
veteran soldier with a cool eyepatch, or maybe even a cyclops knight. Then you
look up the One Eye disadvantage and notice that it gives you major penalties in
combat.

While this is realistic, the type of story that likely inspired you is quite
cinematic, which makes seeing those penalties a bit disappointing. One-eyed
movie and game protagonists never seem to be inconvenienced by their
disability. In fact, it's often turned into an asset, as it makes enemies
underestimate them. Here's a new disadvantage to emulate that.

### One Eye, Cinematic (-5 points)

You may have only one eye, but that doesn't even slow you down! You do not
suffer from the DX and skill penalties from the realistic version of this
advantage, and may generally behave as if you had perfect depth perception and a
full field of view. This is typical of action heroes, and naturally one-eyed
aliens or fantasy creatures.

This is still worth points as a disadvantage because you still do have only one
eye! If that eye is crippled, you're _blind_. You also suffer any other
consequences that might be attached ot the condition in your setting, such as
social penalties or bonuses for other people to recognize you.

This disadvantage is also still worth points in **Dungeon Fantasy**. Its implied
setting might not attach any social penalties to the condition, but it _does_
make losing an eye something far more likely to happen than in other settings,
which puts you at an increased risk of going blind.
