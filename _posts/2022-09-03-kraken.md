Krakens have been in the game since AD&D, but here they get some extra lore.

## The Lore

At the beginning of time, long before the creation of the first mortals, the
Krakens escaped from the Far Realm and entered the middle world and the Astral
Sea, trailing the debris of other broken worlds behind them.

They had a good time for a while, but then a great cataclysm (perhaps the Dawn
War) scattered them. In our narrative present most of the surviving krakens are
hidden in the deepest trenches of the middle world's oceans, or slumbering in
forgotten corners of the Astral. Every once in a while, though, one of them will
leave these dark holes and once again wreak havoc.

These creatures are extremely intelligent, though their mentalities are very
alien to mortals. They're hostile to mortal sapients for incomprehensible
reasons, and are drawn to wherever large groups of sapient minds can be
found. When they emerge, groups of cultists soon gather around them, composed
both of mortal worshippers and aberrant creatures. Krakens are more than smart
enough to command and use these cults to help fulfill their destructive goals.

So yeah, Krakens are Great Old Ones.

## The Monsters

We have two varieties of kraken here. One is more geared towards the classic
"giant squid attacks ship" scenario, and the other leans more on the Great Old
One aesthetic. Both are Gargantuan Aberrant Magical Beasts.

### Sea Kraken

A kraken that lives in the seas of the middle world. It is said that terrible
storms follow in their wake. They love to attack ships, and any vessel grabbed
by a Sea Kraken is likely doomed unless it happens to be transporting a party of
particularly badass adventurers.

Sea Krakens are Level 10 Solo Soldiers with 432 HP, which makes them a bit
lower-level than I anticipated given their general lore. They have darkvision, a
ground speed of 6, and a swim speed of 10. I think this makes them faster in
water than most ships.

Sea Krakens are obviously **Aquatic**, which means they can breathe underwater
and gain a +2 attack bonus against non-aquatic creatures fighting them in the
water. They also have **Threatening Reach** 3. As you might guess, this is a
grabby monster. Escaping its grabs requires a DC 26 Athletics or DC 22 Acrobatis
check.

The kraken's basic attack involves its **Crushing Tentacles**, which are
Reach 3. They damage and grab on a hit, and the kraken can have up to 8
creatures grabbed by this attack. The monster can spend a minor action to
sustain all of its grabs and deal an automatic 5 damage to all victims.

**Devourer of Ships** is a literal anti-vehicle attack - it can only target
vehicles, and it's what the beast uses to coil around a ship. It deals heavy
damage to the target ship and restrains it while the kraken remains within 3
squares of it. While restrained, the ship takes 20 damage at the start of the
target's turn. Its pilot can spend a Standard action to give the ship a saving
throw, and if it passes it escapes the grab.

And don't worry, krakens don't have to split their attention between a ship and
its crew. **Coils of Doom** is an at-will power that allows them to use Crushing
Tentacles twice and Devourer of Ships once with a single action.

Once per encounter they can also use an ability named **Wavewrack** to create a
zone in a Close Burst 3 around themselves. This zone is difficult terrain. When
an enemy starts their turn inside, they take 5 damage and are slid 2
squares. The Kraken can spend a minor action to slide this zone up to 3
squares. Do note that a Close Burst 3 around a Gargantuan creature is _much_
larger than one around a Medium creature.

Aside from moving the zone, the kraken can spend minor actions to activate any
of the following abilities. **Fatal Plunge** is an attack against a grabbed
creature that deals light damage and slides the target 3 squares. As the name
implies, this can allow the kraken to drag them _underwater_. It can also
**Fling** a grabbed creature, sliding them adjacent to another creature and
making a lightly-damaging attack against both. This ends the grab. And finally,
it can shoot **Venom Bolts** that deal poison damage and blind (save ends).

We're not done yet! If a grabbed creature damages the kraken, the monster can
use **Vengeful Constriction** as a reaction to deal 5 automatic damage to every
creature it's grabbing.

### Astral Kraken

Astral Krakens are "sea monsters" in the same way the Astral is a "sea". Their
bodies are made of stars and shadow, their eyes two black lightless
voids. Madness precedes them and follows in their wake. You might say they're
closer to their original forms than the sea kraken, as they never had to
acclimate to the middle world. You know how some people worship Aboleths as
god-like beings older than time? I bet Aboleths worship astral krakens in the
same way.

Astral Krakens are Level 25 Solo Controllers with 925 HP, putting them in the
same "weight class" as godforged and primordial colossi, divine and demonic
exarchs, and most ancient dragons. It takes the sea kraken chassis and adds
madness-themed abilities on top. It has a flight speed of 10, and
Blindsight 20. Invisibility won't save you.

The kraken's melee attacks have Threatening Reach 4. Its **Tentacles From
Beyond** work like the sea kraken's, damaging and grabbing. The escape DC is 41
for Athletics, and 37 for Acrobatics. Sustaining the grab deals 15 psychic
damage to all victims.

**Absorb Psyche** targets all grabbed victims at once, attacking Will and
dealing psychic damage. A hit also grants the Kraken a +5 bonus to attack with
Touch of Madness (below) _for the rest of the encounter_.

**Touch of Madness** targets a single creature's Will. It does no damage, but it
forces the target to use its highest-level encounter power against another
target of the Kraken's choice. This happens even if the power was already
expended, and doesn't expend the power if it hasn't.

**Devourer of Ships** is here too, and works much like the Sea Kraken
version. Despite its higher accuracy, it deals exactly the same damage. I guess
this makes sense, since a ship's HP varies less than a PC's as level goes up.

As a minor action, the astral kraken can release a **Nullifying Pulse** in a
Close Blast 4. This non-damaging attack targets Will and dazes (save ends) on a
hit. There are no other minor action attacks, but it doesn't _need_ any more
with such a powerful multi-daze at its disposal.

Its triggered actions are pretty scary too! When someone misses the kraken,
they're forced to **Behold the Horror**. This is a reaction attack that targets
Will, deals psychic damage, and dominates for a turn. Luckily it can only happen
at most once per round, since it's a reaction.

Once per encounter, when the kraken is first bloodied, it lets out a **Psychic
Scream**, which covers a large enough area (Close Burst 10!) that it's likely
to target every enemy. This attacks Will, and on a hit it deals psychic damage
and stuns (save ends).

## Final Impressions

When it's time to release the kraken, these two will not disappoint.

Sea krakens have a lot of straightforward multi-attack capability, and they're
really hard to shake from your ship once they grab on. If the ship manages to
escape, they don't have to divert their attention from the crew to grab the
vessel again.

The astral kraken's multi-attack capability is less straightforward than the sea
kraken's, but it has excellent action denial, and can be terrifying if you give
it time to set things up properly.

Both monsters don't seem to have much defense against being dazed or stunned
other than the standard +5 solo bonus to saves, so doing that is a good way to
neutralize their firepower. If your party is heavy on the action denial powers,
you can make things harder for them by adding a sprinkling of cultist minions
and a leader-type that can grant them extra saves.
