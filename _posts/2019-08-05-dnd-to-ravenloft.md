There's a very important reason for the increasing delay between my [Let's Read
Hell's Rebels][1] posts: for the past few months I've been GMing a Dungeon
Fantasy campaign.

It all started, ironically, when a friend of mine invited a bunch of people to
start a D&D 5th Edition game. He had just acquired a copy of Tales From the
Yawning Portal, the book that adapts a lot of older adventures to 5th edition,
and wanted to make a casual campaign out of it. I accepted because I liked the
idea of participating in a game as a _player_ for once and I didn't actively
dislike vanilla D&D 5th.

This was a weekly game, taking place over Google Hangouts every Sunday
morning. It went relatively well for a while. We plowed through Sunless Cidatel
and much of Forge of Fury in pure dungeon-crawl mode. One day, though, it
happened that only the GM, me, and another player managed to make it into the
session, and we found out the hard way how essential numbers are in this edition
of D&D.

A fight that should have been something of a speedbump to a party of 4-5 turned
into a nearly fatal encounter for a duo, and so we became convinced that it was
pointless to make a go at any of the actual set-piece encounters in front of us.

So I ended up proposing an alternate game for when we didn't have a full party
for D&D. I had just acquired both the Dungeon Fantasy RPG boxed set and the
original Ravenloft module for AD&D, so I proposed a game of DFRPG Ravenloft.

I figured DFRPG delvers would be strong enough to make some progress even when
we had a reduced party, and I had a handy list of [GURPSified Pathfinder
Iconics][2] for them to pick from so that was character creation taken care of.

Pretty much the whole D&D party picked their DFRPG characters - we had Valeros
the Fighter, Harsk the Ranger, Kyra the Cleric, Ezren the Wizard, and Seelah the
Paladin. The week after that, I GMed the introductory session following the
guidelines in the module, and went all-out in roleplaying it and narrating
things.

They _loved it_. It seems at least one of the players was genuinely
scared. I'm not bragging about my own skills - rather, I'm saying OG Ravenloft
is _that_ good.

There was never an officially announced decision or anything, but our little
"D&D" group never played another D&D session after that. The backup GURPS
Ravenloft game became our main event.

Tune in next time to learn how Ravenloft claimed yet another party of unwary
adventurers.
