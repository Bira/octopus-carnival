Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder's Iconic Characters to
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**! This is the eighth post in the series. Previous
entries can be found here:

Now, this should really have been the _seventh_ post in the series, as the
Martial Artist template comes before Scout. In any case, we'll address it today,
which means our character is Sajan. Here he is:

I think he looks kinda awesome. Anyway, his [bio][8] and his [official stats][9]
give us the following information:

- He was born in Vudra, his world's India an analogue, where he was a member of
  the warrior caste along with his beloved twin sister Sajni. Even after they
  were posted to separate barracks at the age of 12 they still met regularly to
  spar and hang out.

- Sajni was given away as part of a peace agreement, and Sajan ran after her. He
  tracked her down to Absalom, his world's "big cosmopolitan city", and has been
  looking for her since.

- As a monk he's quite acrobatic and prefers to rely on his flurry of blows in
  combat. He might also grapple or trip opponents with his hooked "temple
  sword" if that's more tactically advantageous.

The biggest difficulty I see in building Sajan as a DF Martial Artist is that
his Pathfinder version uses unarmed strikes a lot more often than the sword, and
those are harder to make effective in GURPS. My version of him has a bigger
focus on the temple sword, which I statted up as a khopesh from **Low-Tech**. As
a Weapon Master, he can cause quite a bit of damage with swings, and he's almost
as skilled with grapples and unarmed strikes. The gauntlets help him punch armed
and armored opponents without hurting his hands. Sajan's special skills cover
many of the abilities d20 Monks have, as well. His very limited equipment
loadout means I didn't need to spend any character points for extra starting
cash!
