This is kind of an addendum to my earlier post on [Merging Weapon Skills in
GURPS][1], which occurred to me after reading this other post in [After the
Ogre][2]. I realized I hadn't mentioned Shield skills, but I had been merging
them for so long I had forgotten that wasn't the standard.

In my GURPS games, there is only one shield skill:

### Shield (DX/E)

This skill merges **Shield**, **Shield (Buckler)** and **Force
Shield**. There is still a mechanical difference between a shield that's held in
the hand and one that's strapped to the arm, but both of them use the same
skill and there is no familiarity penalty from switching between them.

If you're using the optional rules for Familiarity Penalties in the previous
post, such a penalty would definitely apply when someone used to traditional
shields wields a weightless force shield, and vice-versa. As a reminder, that's
a -2 penalty to Shield that goes away after a few hours of practice during
downtime, at no point cost.
