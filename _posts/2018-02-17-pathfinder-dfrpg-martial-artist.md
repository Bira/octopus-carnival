In this post I continue to write up the iconic characters from Pathfinder for
use in the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Links to all of them will appear on
the [project page][1], which also contains the links to the GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy versions.

Today's template is the Martial Artist, which means today's character is Sajan
the Monk. Here he is:

I think he looks pretty cool! His [bio][8] and [official stats][9] give us the
following information:

- He was born in Vudra, his world's India analogue, where he was a member of the
  warrior caste along with his beloved twin sister Sajni. Even after they were
  posted to separate barracks at the age of 12 they still met regularly to spar
  and hang out.

- Sajni was given away as part of a peace agreement, and Sajan ran after her. He
  tracked her down to Absalom, his world's "big cosmopolitan city", and has been
  looking for her since.

- As a monk he's quite acrobatic and prefers to rely on his flurry of blows in
  combat. He might also grapple or trip opponents with his hooked "temple
  sword" if that's more tactically advantageous.

The [GURPS Dungeon Fantasy version][2] used the stats for a khopesh from GURPS
Low-Tech for the "temple sword". Since this one is restricted only to the
material in the DFRPG boxed set, we go with the Heavy Falchion stats and give up
on the rules for weapon hooks. We also had to lose the gauntlets, as his light
cloth armor is a bit heavier here. Sajan continues to be a very effective
combatant either with his sword or with his fists, and has most of the abilities
people have come to associate with monks in d20.
