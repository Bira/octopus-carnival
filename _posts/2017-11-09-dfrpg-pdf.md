I find myself struggling with minor writer's block[^1], but while I deal with it
you can rejoice with the fact that the [Dungeon Fantasy RPG is finally
available in PDF form!][1]. Yes, it's as expensive as the physical box, buy you
don't have to pay twice that in shipping fees if you live abroad.

[^1]: Writing Valeros is like eating a big lump of raw bread dough. It tastes
    super bland and takes forever to get out of your system.
