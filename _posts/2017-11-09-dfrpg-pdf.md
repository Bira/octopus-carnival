I find myself struggling with minor writer's block[^1], but while I deal with it
you can rejoice with the fact that the [Dungeon Fantasy RPG is finally
available in PDF form!][1]. At forty dollars it's not exactly cheap, but it's
still considerably less expensive than the physical box and you don't need to
spend double its price on shipping if you live abroad!

[^1]: Writing Valeros is like eating a big lump of raw bread dough. It tastes
    super bland and takes forever to get out of your system.
