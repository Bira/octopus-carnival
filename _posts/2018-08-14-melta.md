The theme for this month in the secretive cabal of GURPS bloggers is "fire or
heat", so I figured I would do something a bit different from my usual
dungeonnesque fare and adapt Melta weapons from Warhammer 40K to GURPS.

Hasn't that been done already? Yep! Many times, often for the whole of 40K
rather than just one weapon, with results of varying quality. A quick search for
"gurps meltagun" brings in this [this thread in the SJ Games forums][1] as the
top result, and there are a whole lotta others below that. My only excuse for
doing this is the Full Metal Jacket adage: "There are many like it, but this one
is mine."

## Meltaguns

These bulky weapons fire short-ranged beams of concentrated heat with an effect
similar to the blast of a shaped charge. They use canisters of highly compressed
exotic gasses as ammo, which account for about a third of their considerable
weight. There is pretty much no reason to use one of these instead of a good
anti-vehicle missile, but the Imperium of Man never cared for reason.

A meltagun can punch through most personal and vehicular armor and cause
grievous harm to the soft bits behind it. If you miss, though, your target will
be in a prime position to shoot back or charge at you[^1].

Melta weapons come in several varieties:

**Inferno Pistols** can (barely) be fired with one hand, using Beam Weapons
(Pistol). Their effective range is a bit shorter than that of your typical video
game shotgun, which is quite a feat.

Standard **Meltaguns** are fired using Beam Weapons (Rifle). They do the same
damage as inferno pistols, but have greater range and more shots per
canister.

**Multi-meltas**, as the name implies, basically consist of several meltagun
assemblies bolted together. The resulting weapon is huge and heavy, with a heat
so intense it produces a 3d burn "backblast" that affects the shooter
and anyone standing up to 2 meters behind them. For these reasons it's usually
either carried by large people in powered armor, mounted on vehicles, or
attached to shielded tripods. In the first case it's fired with Beam Weapons
(Rifle); in the others with Gunner (Beams).

All melta weapons halve their armor divisor past 1/2D, and are affected by
spaced, laminated or electromagnetic armor as if they were shaped charges.

## Design Notes

Like Perfect Organism did over on [his forum thread][1], I started by looking
through Ultra-Tech in search of already existing weapons that would be similar
to Warhammer 40K's melta weapons. The plasma flamers on page 127 of that book
looked almost promising, but look both too weak and too slim to fit the bill.
The root of the problem is GURPS Ultra-Tech assumes a universe that makes sense,
even when describing superscience. But this is Warhammer 40K! Nothing makes
sense!

So in the end I took inspiration both from the plasma flamer stats in Ultra-Tech
and from the melta weapon stats in the Only War corebook. Then I pulled the
final numbers of out the Warp. The end result is even more insane and less
realistic than UT's plasma flamers, but that's what the superscience tag is for.

_Pricing_ these monstrosities is left as an exercise for the reader. If you're
playing in the 40K setting or somewhere similar, cost doesn't really matter,
since the people most likely to use these weapons will have them issued by their
bosses. In other settings they're perfect as the inventions of a pyromaniac
mad scientist or the like. If they are available commercially, they should be
expensive, and in all of these cases their Legality Class it no better than 1.

[^1]: If you _hit_ and your target is still standing, then you've just angered
    something that can stand up to melta-guns. Good luck surviving!
