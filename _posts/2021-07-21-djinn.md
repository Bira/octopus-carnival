This is part of a series! Go [here][1] to see the other entries.

Djinns are inspired by the same real world Arabic folklore that inspired
efreets, and they've been in the game since at least BECMI.

## The Lore

Djinns are some of the most ancient sapient elementals, on par with efreets
(which we saw in the [first Monster Manual/Vault Let's Read][2]). They're
aspected to Air, and in the book's own words, are "Ingenious Engineers of the
Fabulous".

Back in the day, the djinn built entire civilizations in the Elemental
Chaos. Theirs were shining palaces filled with treasure beyond mortal
comprehension, and great gleaming cities built on mobile floating
platforms.

When the Dawn War came, the djinns chose to side with the primordials, which I
suppose they saw as the pragmatic choice. After all, their own empire was
outside the world, and the stronger primordials looked like they had a better
chance of winning. In the end, though, they chose wrong.

The gods scattered the djinns as punishment for their deeds in the war, and
imprisoned many of them in objects such as rings, lamps, or other artifacts. The
ones that remained free had their powers severely reduced. Over the ages a lot
of those artifacts and a lot of djinn relics made their way to other planes and
to the world.

So yeah, it's totally possible for a PC to find the proverbial magic lamp. It's
up to the GM whether the magic that binds the djinn inside forces it to serve
the bearer, though. If it does, then these relics are super-powerful! Even if
the djinn can't grant wishes like in the stories, it's still an epic-level
creature full of magic powers.

The djinns who remained free, and those who freed themselves over the ages,
mostly busy themselves with roaming the planes looking for the remains of their
ancient civilization, with the goal of rebuilding it. I would guess they had
some success in that, but that it's still nowhere up to its former heights of
glory.

The djinns presented here are all Unaligned, which implies that as a people they
are mostly interested in picking up the pieces of their civilization than in
going a-conquering or enslaving others. They can still get into conflict with
PCs who (knowingly or not) keep those pieces from returning to their original
owners. Hold on to that lamp for too long and its inhabitant's friends will show
up at your door with some very pointed questions. I can't say they'd be wrong to
do so.

## The Numbers

Djinns are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Air keyword. They have Blindsight
10, an immunity to disease and poison, Resist 15 Thunder, a ground speed of 6
and a flight speed of 8. The least intelligent djinn in this entry nas an Int of
19, so the ingenious engineers are also geniuses. Their level range covers the
early-to-mid Epic tier, making them only slightly weaker than efreets.

Most djinn powers have an air or storm theme, but they vary per stat block.

### Djinn Thunderer

Thunderers are Level 20 Artillery with 146 HP and all djinn traits. They wield
jeweled scepters and strong air magic in combat.

The **Scepter** mostly acts as an implement, but can be used as a Reach 2 basic
melee attack in a pinch. Their main ranged attack is a **Thunderburst** (area
burst 2 within 20 vs. Fortitude), which does thunder damage and dazes for a
turn. Once per encounter they can use **Imperious Thunder**, which targets
Reflex and which has the same area and damage but instead of dazing causes 10
ongoing thunder damage (save ends) _even when it misses_.

The thunderer can avoid getting boxed in with **Zephyr Step** (minor; recharge
6), which allows it to teleport 20 squares. If it takes damage from a critical
hit, it will respond with **Rage of Storms** (close burst 2 vs. Reflex; free
action, encounter). This does high thunder damage, pushes hit targets 5 squares,
and gives the djinn 1 action point as an effect, which it can use normally later
on.

### Djinn Windbow

Windbows are Level 22 Skirmishers with 204 HP and all standard djinn
traits. They wield bows that fire arrows made out of wind, and this might lead
PCs to think they're artillery. However, they're equally good at melee and
ranged combat.

Their basic ranged attack is the **Windbow** (Ranged 10/20), and their basic
melee attack the **Slash of Thunder**. Both do about the same amount of damage,
which is thunder for the Slash and physical for the bow.

The djinn can cause one of their arrows to turn into a **Brutal Zephyr** (Ranged
30 vs. Reflex), which does thunder damage and is a bit stronger than the usual
attack. If this misses, the windbow gets to choose a different target within 10
squares of the original one and re-roll the attack against them.

If damaged by a critical hit they can use **Blowback**, which works exactly like
the Thunderer's Rage of Storms.

### Djinn Stormsword

Stormswords fight with scimitars and train to form whirlwinds that pull enemies
towards their blades. They're Level 24 Soldiers with 222 HP and all standard
djinn traits, plus Resist 15 Lightning.

Their **Scimitars** are Reach 2, high-crit weapons that mark for a turn on a
hit. Their printed critical damage is 9d10+33, and it would be even higher with
a math fix. They can also use a technique named **Whirlwind Dervish** (close burst 2
vs. AC; encounter) which does heavy thunder and lightning damage and recharges
when they're critically hit.

Stormswords can drag targets into range with **Come To Me** (Ranged 5
vs. Fortitude; minor action), which does no damage but pulls the targets 5
squares. They can sometimes intensify that into a **Spinning Vortex** (Ranged 5
vs. Reflex; recharge 6), which does heavy cold and thunder damage, and
immobilizes (save ends).

### Djinn Skylord

Skylords are djinn spell-casters, specializing in sky- and weather-themed
magic. They're Level 25 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 236 HP along
with all standard djinn traits.

Their main weapon/implement is the **Storm Staff** (reach 2 vs. AC), which does
physical damage and allows the djinn to shift 2 squares or make an extra
recharge roll for **Storm Shout**. This, in turn, is a Close Blast 5 vs. Will
that does heavy thunder damage, pushes 3 squares, and knocks prone. It recharges
on a 5-6.

The skylord's main ranged attack is **Mystic Hail** (ranged 20 vs. Will), which
does psychic damage and makes the target grant combat advantage to the
djinn. This lasts until the target spends a standard action clearing their head,
which is a heavier cost than having to roll a save. This works as a nice setup
for **Sandstorm** (Close Burst 5 vs. Will), which does heavy physical damage and
creates a zone. Allies inside the zone gain concealment, and enemies starting
their turns inside are dazed for a turn. This can be sustained with a minor
action. And finally, the djinn can also use a minor action (1/round) to use
**Elemental Command** (ranged 10), which always hits, does no damage, and slides
the target 1 square.

## Sample Encounters and Final Impressions

Djinns are said to mostly hang out with their own kind, and the two sample
encounters (level 22 and 26) bear this out. They're assorted djinn parties,
likely journeying after relics of their old empire. The first one has a couple
of rimefire griffon pets, the second has 2 storm gorgons.

Djinns are cool, and I like that they're presented as not necessarily
hostile. Unlike in previous edition they're not in an eternal war against the
efreets, though I imagine they don't often have friendly interactions all that
often either. It might also be interesting to take a page from Middle Eastern
folklore here and say that many djinn in the present are devout worshippers of
the gods.
