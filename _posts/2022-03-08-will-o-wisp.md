Will-O'-Wisps in D&D are inspired by folklore, and their legend is in turn
inspired by the natural phenomena that make swamp gas glow at night. I think
they've been in the game since AD&D, though their exact lore might have changed
a bit over the years.

## The Lore

Will-o'-wisps are cruel fey spirits who feed on the fear and despair of other
sapients. They like to hang out in swamps and marshes, whose natural mists and
swamp lights provide them with hiding places. Their bodies are orbs of gauzy
material, and they glow with an otherwordly light that has the power to lure
unwary victims. It can also burn their flesh and drain their spirit.

Their tactics are pretty much iconic - lure victims to an isolated place full of
hindering terrain and kill them in a way that produces maximum horror.

These creatures can communicate in Elven, and when they speak they have that
cool effect where they brighten and dim in compass with their speech. They can
also douse their light for better stealth, but this also prevents them from
using it as a weapon.

## The Numbers

Will-o'-Wisps are Small Fey Magical Beasts, and Level 10 Lurkers with 57
HP. They count as Insubstantial, taking only half damage from non-force
attacks. They have low-light vision and a flight speed of 6 with Hover, and an
altitude limit of 2 squares.

As mentioned above, wisps can turn their light on or off using the **Fey Light**
ability (minor action 1/round). A darkened wisp has concealment and can make
Stealth checks to become hidden, but it cannot attack. If a wisp is missed by an
attack, it can **Blink Out** as a reaction. When this happens, the wisp darkens
and teleports 5 squares. I guess it can make that Stealth check as part of this
action too.

The wisp's attacks are all light-based. The most classic one is of course
**Luring Glow**. This is a Close Burst 20 that targets one non-blinded creature,
which is another way to say it's a ranged attack that doesn't draw opportunity
attacks. It targets Will, does no damage, pulls the victim 3 squares, and dazes
it (save ends).

Once the victim is in range and vulnerable, the wisp is going to hit it with its
basic **Glimmer Wisp** attack, which is Reach 2, targets Reflex, and does
radiant damage. Once per encounter it can also use **Spirit Drain** on a
bloodied target. This is a Reach 3 attack that targets Fortitude, deals psychic
damage, weakens (save ends) and heals the wisp for 14 HP.

## Sample Encounters and Final Impressions

Wisps are lurkers and have a couple of good stealth powers, but they don't
seem to have a lot of ability to take advantage of this stealth. Their best
power is the very controller-y Luring Glow. When building wisp fights, you
should pair them with other opportunistic monsters that can bring the hurt to
those dazed characters.

Our sample encounter is level 9: two wisps and a quartet of spriggans (two
powries, 2 thorns). Evil fairies all around.
