In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Links to all of them will appear in the
[project page][1], which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions.

Today's template is the Swashbuckler, which means today's character is
Jirelle. Here she is:

Even if you're familiar with Pathfinder's Iconics, Jirelle might be somewhat new
to you. This is because the class she represents, the Swashbuckler, is not from
the core rules but from the "Advanced Class Guide" supplement. You can find her
bio [here][9], and the only place where I could find her stats is inside [this
free package of premade iconic characters][10] that contains all of them.

From these, we can learn the following:

- Jirelle is a half-elf born in the Shackles, a pirate-infested archipelago. She
  sunk her evil pirate's mother ship to avoid becoming a demonic sacrifice, but
  the ship and its whole crew later returned as undead. Her main long-term goal
  is returning them to the depths.

- Her fighting style is acrobatic and daring, relying a lot on precision and
  fencing skill.

- She wields a rapier as her main weapon, and despite the illustration showing
  one of every traditional off-hand fencing weapon on her person, the character
  sheet indicates the buckler is her favorite.

This version of Jirelle is pretty much identical to the [GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy][2] version, with the main difference being equipment. Her armor and
buckler are a lot heavier, and thus I was forced to perform a little point
shuffling to get her an Armor Familiarity perk. She's still as good at fencing
as ever, though.

One thing I noticed here is that the DFRPG version of Rapier Wit uses the
Intimidation skill rather than Public Speaking. I don't think it would be a
stretch to allow it to be used with Public Speaking, so I'm keeping that skill
here. If your GM sticks to the letter of what the book says, feel free to move
those Public Speaking points to Intimidation instead.
