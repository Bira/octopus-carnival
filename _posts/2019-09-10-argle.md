Argle wants no trouble. Even when town people try to give him trouble. Lives
deep in the forest. Hunts his food. Sells pelts in town, once in a while. Is
friend to small children. Small children have not learned to fear Argle
yet.

One day, strangers disturb Argle's peace. Think he's an evil wizard. Much
explaining happens before they realize Argle only have similar name to evil
wizard.

Strangers depart. Days later, Argle departs too. Finds some friends, which is
good. Goes questing with friends. Maybe someday he find evil wizard and kill him
to stop people from confusing Argle with him. Also demons and stranger stuff.

Argle used 2 character points to buy extra gear. Likes to shoot enemies with his
bow. Will grapple and stab if can't shoot. Will spend earned points on being
more shooty; might spend them on being better wrestler too.
