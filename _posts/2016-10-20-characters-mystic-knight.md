This is the second of the two Dragon's Dogma-specific character templates I
promised. Like the [Magic Archer][1], it's a 250-point template suitable for a
Dungeon Fantasy campaign, with additional notes on how they fit into the
Dragon's Dogma campaign setting.

Note that this is not the same as the template presented in **Pyramid
#3/13**, despite having the same name. As explained [earlier][3], I'm staying
away from Imbuements in this setting. Of course, if you like the Pyramid Mystic
Knight better, don't hesitate to use it instead! And if you want to use both
templates in the same game, please feel free to rename this one.

## The Mystic Knight

You are a master of war, equally versed in the arts of melee combat and
battlefield magic. Unlike the [Magic Archer][1] you like to be right in the
middle of the fight, though you prefer to make the enemy come to you rather than
charge blindly into the fray. You fight like a knight (**DF 1**, p. 10) but can
also handle trickier foes with your wizardly spells.

**Attributes**: ST 13 {30}; DX 13 {60}; IQ 12 {40}; HT 13 {30}.

**Secondary Characteristics**: Damage 1d/2d-1; BL 16.9kg (17 lbs); HP 13; Will
12; Per 12; FP 13; Basic Speed 6.00 {-10}; Basic Move 6 {0}.

**Advantages**: Born War Leader 1 {5}; Magery 3 {35}; _and_ Weapon Channeling
{1}. &bull; A further 20 points chosen from [Archmagic][2] abilities or ST +1 or
+2 {10/level}, DX +1 {20}, IQ +1 {20}, HT +1 or +2 {10 or 20}, HP +1 to +3
{2/level}, FP +1 to +5 {3/level}; Born War-Leader 2-4 {5/level}, Combat Reflexes
{15}, Enhanced Block 1 {5}, Enhanced Parry 1 (One Melee Weapon skill) {5},
Fearlessness {2/level}, Hard to Kill {2/level}, Hard to Subdue {2/level}, High
Pain Threshold {10}, Luck {15}, Magery 3-4 {10/level}, Mind Shield {4/level},
Rapid Healing {5}, Recovery {10}, Signature Gear {Varies}, Striking ST 1 or 2
{5/level}, or Weapon Bond {1}.

**Disadvantages**: -20 points chosen from among Bad Temper {-10[^1]}, Bloodlust
{-10[^1]}, Code of Honor (Pirate's, Soldier's or Chivalry) {-5, -10, -15},
Curious {-5[^1]}, Frightens Animals {-10}, Obsession (Slay a specific type of
monster) {-5[^1]}, Pyromania {-5[^1]}, Unnatural Features 1-5 {-1/level}, or
Weirdness Magnet {-15}. &bull; Another -20 points chosen from the previous list
or Bully {-10[^1]}, Compulsive Carousing {-5[^1]}, Greed {-15[^1]}, Honesty
{-10[^1]}, Overconfidence {-5[^1]}, Sense of Duty (Adventuring Companions _or_
Nation) {-5 or -10}, Social Stigma (Excommunicated) {-5[^4]}, Stubbornness {-5},
or Wounded {-5}.

**Primary Skills**: Hidden Lore (Demons, Magical Items, Magical Writings,
Spirits _or_ Undead) _and_ Occultism, both (A) IQ {2}-12; Thaumathology (VH)
IQ+1 {1}[^2]-12. &bull;_One_ of Crossbow or Thrown Weapon (Axe/Mace _or_ Spear),
all (E) DX+2 {4}-15; or Throwing (A) DX+1 {4}-14. &bull; _One_ of these three
melee skills packages:

1. _One_ of Axe/Mace, Broadsword, or Spear, all (A) DX+4 {16}-17 _and_ Shield
   (E) DX+3 {8}-16.
2. Flail (H) DX+2 {16}-16 _and_ Shield (E) DX+3 {8}-16.
3. _One_ of Polearm, Spear, or Two-Handed Sword, all (A) DX+5 {24}-19.

**Secondary Skills**: Armoury (Body Armor _or_ Melee Weapons) and Connoisseur
(Weapons), both (A) IQ+1 {4}-13; Brawling (E) DX+1 {2}-14; Wrestling (A) DX+1
{4}-14; Leadership (A) IQ {1}[^3]-12; _and_ Strategy and Tactics, both (H) IQ+1
{2}[^3]-13.

**Background Skills**: _Seven_ of Forced Entry or Fast-Draw (any), both (E) DX

(A) IQ-1 {1}-12; Diplomacy (H) IQ-2 {1}-11; Hiking (A) HT-1 {1}-12; or
Observation (A) Per-1 {1}-11.

**Spells**: Spend 20 points on wizardly spells, which start at either (H) IQ+1
{1}-13 or (VH) IQ {1}-12 with the +3 from Magery. Alternatively, spend some of
those points in additional Archmagic abilities.

### Customization Notes.

Much of the variation in this template comes from weapon and spell choice. All
Mystic Knights favor either spells that enhance their own abilities and weapons
(such as Flaming Weapon and Flaming Armor), deliver DR-ignoring damage that they
can channel through their weapons or shields (such as Shocking Touch or Death
Touch), or cause damage over an area that doesn't depend on resistance
rolls. Spells such as Affect Spirits also come in handy for insubstantial foes.

Mystic Knigs who favor their spells should increase either IQ or Magery with
discretionary advantage points. They might also wish to spend 10 of their points
reserved for spells in an additional level of Magery. Adding an Energy Reserve
or extra FP is always useful, as well. Those who wish to emphasize their martial
side should increase DX or ST, or perhaps invest in more Born War Leader
talent. And in all cases, spending some of the points earned from quirks in
extra starting cash for armor and weapons is advisable.

Beyond that they can be knightly paragons (Honesty, Sense of Duty), dastardly
brigands (Greed, Callous, Bully), slightly odd from their study of magic
(Unnatural Features, Pyromania, Weirdness Magnet), or a combination of these.

### Mystic Knight Power-Ups

Mystic Knights may spend extra points in spells and in anything on their
template, plus these options:

- Magery up to 6 {10/level}.
- Born War Leader up to 6 {5/level}.
- Any Archmagic abilities.
- Enhanced Block up to 2 {5/level}.
- Enhanced Parry (one Melee Weapon skill) up to 2 {5/level}.
- Extra Attack 1 {25}.
- The Armor Mastery and Shield Mastery power-ups found in **DF 11** p. 29.
- Weapon Master (Single Weapon) or Weapon Master (Weapon and Shield) {20 or 25}.

As their base skill level with wizardly spells is kind of low compared to that
of a full caster, all Mystic Knights can benefit from more Magery, from an
Energy Reserve, or increased FP (which also helps with combat maneuvers).

### Mystic Knights in Gransys

Mystic Knights are more common in Gransys and neighboring nations than Magic
Archers, especially among actual knights, as the physical component of their
fighting style is already popular with that crowd. They remain relatively rare
when compared to their non-magical cousins, though.

Like pure Knights, they have access to Status 1 or 2 in campaigns where that
matters. And since all magic in Gransys is wizardly in nature the Social Stigma
(Excommunicated) advantage is worth only -5 points.

## New Perks

### Weapon Channeling

Normally, the Staff enchantment doesn't work if applied to something other than
a wand or staff. With this perk, available only to Mystic Knights, you become
able to use melee weapons and shields with the enchantment! You must still buy
or find items so enchanted, and you can't use them to reduce the range to a
distant subject. They can still be used to deliver touch and Melee spells like
standard Staffs. A block with a shield won't trigger a held Melee spell, but a
subsequent Beat attempt _will_. So will a shield bash.

## New Spells

One of the signature Mystic Knight abilities in the original game is the power
to enchant all the party's with a given element at once, which saves a lot of
time when that element turns out to be required in the middle of a fight. This
is something can try replicating here by introducing a few new spells.

These spells can be learned by anyone who meets the prerequisites. They're an
efficient choice when the party is composed of three or more adventurers who
have the chance to cluster inside the affected area. GMs worried about having
their PCs waltzing into every fight with elementally-charged weapons should
disallow them!
