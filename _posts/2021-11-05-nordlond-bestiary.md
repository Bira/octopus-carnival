Gaming Ballistic is about to launch a campaign for the Nordlond Bestiary, and
you can go to [this page][1] to click a button and be notified of when that
happens. Everyone always says GURPS really needs a good bestiary. Well, here's
one!

Contributing to Kickstarter campaigns is a bit hard for me, as my bank dislikes
it and tries to cancel my credit card whenever I do it. But if that's not a
problem for you, by all means click that button. I'll be here waiting for the
book's final launch to buy myself a copy in the traditional way :).
