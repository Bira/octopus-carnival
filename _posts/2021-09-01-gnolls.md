The absolutely best thing about the Monster Manual 2 gnolls is that I don't have
to talk about them! It turns out I've already covered them all in the
[MM1/Monster Vault gnoll post][2]. The Deathpledged Gnoll, Fang of Yeenoghu, and
Gnoll Gorger that appeared in the Monster Vault all had their first appearances
here in the MM2. Just read the original article for everything you need to know
about 4e gnolls.
