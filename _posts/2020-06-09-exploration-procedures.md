Earlier this year I published a post on "[Old School Movement][1]" with a simple
set of rules I could use when GMing converted old-school D&D and AD&D dungeons
in Dungeon Fantasy. Recently, the Nature Kills blog has also published [their
own take][2] on the same subject in a post titled "Dungeoncrawl Procedures".

What I find most interesting on that post, and on the sources it links, is that
they see the lack of this detailed procedure in recent D&D editions as a grave
omission in that system. Having a canonical procedure to crawl a dungeon or to
perform any other sort of exploration is a vital pre-requisite for properly
designing these dungeons and other places.

The actual procedure outlined there is similar to mine in nature, but differs in
some details and adds others I didn't cover. The ones I found most interesting
are:

- This procedure should apply to all dungeon exploration, not just to AD&D
  adaptations.

- Default movement speed is double what I guessed (encumbered Move x 20m per
turn).

- Traps are only sprung 2 out of 6 times. A direct translation of an old-school
  mechanic that's perfect for use when you're not constantly using a map and
  miniatures.

They have convinced me to apply this mechanic to all dungeon crawls, but I
disagree with enough of their details that I feel I have to revise my own
procedure. That will happen some other time.
