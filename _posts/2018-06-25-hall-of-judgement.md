I thought Gaming Ballistic's Lost Hall of Tyr[^1] looked like an interesting
adventure when it came out, but I didn't buy it because it was for D&D 5th
Edition. I did think at the time that it would be really nifty if it ever came
out for GURPS... and now I'm about to get my wish.

Gaming Ballistic has recently starter another kickstarter campaign for [Hall of
Judgement][3], which is a version of the same adventure for the Dungeon Fantasy
Roleplaying Game.

It's not a direct conversion. The setting part has been made a bit more generic
so it can fit into ongoing DFRPG campaigns, and the adventure itself has been
expanded to be more sandboxy, with more wilderness travel and a few sidequests
added in. It's also the first ever licensed third-party supplement for the
DFRPG, so I'm backing this not just for the book itself but to send a message to
Steve Jackson games that I want to see more of this type of deal.
