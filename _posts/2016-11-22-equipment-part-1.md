Now that we have a good handle on the locations and characters of Gransys, let's
take a look at its _stuff_. This means both the gear available to its delvers
and the treasure that can be obtained from its dungeons. We'll start with money,
since that figures prominently in both categories.

## Currency

The original game used a simplified currency system typical of electronic
RPGs. The unit of currency was a generic "gold piece". Early game items had
2-digit prices for consumables and 4-digit prices for equipment, going up to 5-
and 6-digit prices respectively in the late game. Money was found in bags
containing up to 10 thousand gold pieces either hidden in dungeons, or dropped
from enemies. It could also be earned by selling items in town, and by the
end-game selling unused equipment is the player's main source of income.

We can afford to be a little more detailed in this adaptation. I want Gransys to
have a currency system that fits more with the "dungeon fantasy" genre and if
possible I also want to sneak a tiny bit of history in there like I did with the
[villages and baronies][1]. This results in the following system:

Under Duke Edmun's rule, Gransys has come to use coinage of several
denominations. The _copper penny_ is worth $1 in GURPS money, is about 23mm in
diameter and weights 8 grams (125 to the kilogram). The _silver shilling_ is
worth $5, has a diameter of 15mm and weights 2.5 grams (400 to the
kilogram). And the _ducat_ is made of gold, worth $100, has a diameter a hair
over 12mm, and weights 2.5 grams (400 to the kilogram). All of them are stamped
with the Duke's face on one side and with his coat of arms (a dragon with an
exposed heart) on the other.

These coins are heavily used in Gran Soren and the smaller towns of Gransys, and
also by merchants and nobles to conduct their business. They are less widespread
among the common citizens in the baronies and villages, who make most of what
they need themselves and barter with their neighbors for the rest. They might
still own some money from trading with traveling peddlers, but it's not unusual
for it to be used solely for that purpose. Feudal lords at this level take their
tribute in goods more often than in money.

These coin weights mean that the 10-thousand-coin "giant bag of gold" found in
the orignal game would likely be a good deal smaller than its in-game graphic
indicates, but would weight around 25kg and be worth $1,000,000!  Needless to
say, none but the most fabulous treasures have that much gold in them. The same
weight of silver would be worth $50,000, or $10,000 if it's copper. Most hoards
will likely be mixed.

PCs can also find variant coins, with different sizes or even made of different
materials. These can come from the neighboring nations or from the ancient
depths of some dungeon. See **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Treasures 1: Glittering
Prizes** for inspiration. "Money changer" isn't an official occupation in
Gransys, but many a wealthy merchant or collector would be glad to perform the
service for a friendly fee.

## Mundane Equipment

As mentioned before, Gransys is mostly a TL 4 setting, with transportation and
information technology still at TL 3. What this means to delver PCs is that the
list of gear available to them matches the one from **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**
pretty much exactly.

Those groups who want to go into a little more detail here are encouraged to use
the weapon and armor tables from **GURPS Low-Tech** instead of the ones from the
**Basic Set**, especially for armor. This will generally result in lighter but
more expensive armor, which matches up a bit better with the "realistic Middle
Ages" vibe the setting gives off. And even though only the European Low-Tech
weapons are appropriate for a Gransys game, that will still increase the amount
of possible choices for players.

Gransys towns carry basic mundane equipment and may have a few of the simpler
weapons. Special orders and more elaborate weapons and armor are always
available in Gran Soren, and _may_ be available in towns on an individual
basis. Manors might provide a limited selection of basic gear, but most villages
will be unable to spare anything other than some food.

## Magic Items

Magic items merit some special discussion. Like in standard **Dungeon Fantasy**,
their making is the province of NPCs, but here these aren't scholarly (or
priestly) enchanters. Instead, they're artisans who have mastered the secrets of
their craft. These secrets are effectively a form of alchemy, and a master
artisan might be as eccentric as any powerful magician. Still, they usually get
more respect than a powerful spell caster, who is likely to be seen as sinister
and feared for his powers.

Magic items are available in Gran Soren at the same prices quoted in **Dungeon
Fantasy 1**. This includes alchemical concoctions, available from
apothecaries. It might be possible to buy such things in smaller settlements
if the GM thinks they might be home to a sufficiently skilled artisan.

Anything not listed as available for sale in **DF 1** is either an ancient
artifact that has to be pried from a ruin or monster, or the work of a true
master of the sort who hides away from the world and places absurd demands on
prospective customers. Either way, it requires adventuring to get!

At the top end, most of the Artifacts from **Dungeon Fantasy 6** and similar
sources would be appropriate for inclusion in the game. They would obviously
only be available as hard-to-find loot.

game's most distinctive subsystems - equipment upgrades!
