A while ago I spent quite some time statting up Pathfinder Iconic characters for
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**, one for each template from **DF1**. That project even
has its own page [here][1], where you can see all the completed
characters. Aside from being fun in itself (I like making characters!), the main
motivation was to provide a resource for players just getting into **GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy**, and into the as yet unreleased **Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying
Game**.

Well, the DFRPG is out to backers now, and will be out to everyone else pretty
soon. Now that I can get a good look at its text, I see that the difference
between it and the GURPS DF line is not unlike that between the first and second
edition of, say, AD&D. A lot of things are the same, but there are enough
differences that you might need to do a little work to use material from one
game in the other.

And so it turned out that my set of converted Pathfinder Iconics doesn't quite
fit the DFRPG rules, mostly because a lot of them include material from the
GURPS line that didn't make it into the standalone boxed set. As I still want
them to be useful to players of the latter, it's time to do a little conversion!

Here's what's going to happen: I'm going to redo all of the Iconics that
correspond to the templates present in the DFRPG boxed set, which is everyone
except for Seoni the Sorceress. Each of them is going to go up as a new article
that will be linked alongside the old one in the project page. The new PCs will
be built using _only_ material found in the DFRPG boxed set, with perhaps a bit
of original material tossed in where needed (like for Lini's racial
template). Each article will also comment on the differences between the
resulting stats.

Like GURPS DF versions, these are inspired by the official published bios and
stats for the iconics. Their capabilities are mostly inspired by the 7th-level
version of the stats, and their gear by the 1st-level version, since that's
closer to what a character's starting money can buy. This time around I'll also
take inspiration from the GURPS DF stats, of course, since my decisions on how
to adapt stuff from d20 to GURPS haven't really changed. I hope you enjoy the
new versions!
