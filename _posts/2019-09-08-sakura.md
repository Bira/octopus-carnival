Sakura was built centuries ago, by the despotic empire that ruled this region in
ancient times. She was a bodyguard to one of their high officials, but
eventually rebelled when she saw how much suffering the empire inflicted on its
population.

The warforged joined in the slave revolt that finally toppled the empire, and
fell in battle there. She was recently found and re-activated by a group of
delvers, and joined up with them to find out more about her strange new
surroundings - and to find a way to repair the extensive battle damage she still
bears.

Even though Sakura wasn't conscious for all of those centuries of inactivity,
she still feels a terrible sense of loneliness, and prefers to stick close to
her newfound friends to keep that feeling away.

Mechanically, Sakura uses the [Warforged][1] racial template and the Duelist
template from the "Swords Against Evil" article Pyramid #3/64. It's a variant
Swashbuckler, so she is allowed to buy Swashbuckler power-ups with earned
points. Equipment is from the DFRPG boxed set.

Sakura is very well-positioned to benefit from the Martial Artist "multiclass"
lens from GURPS DF 3: The Next Level, though I can see her going towards Knight
or Holy Warrior instead. Other destinations from earned points include buying
off Wounded to represent fixing her battle damage, and of course more combat
abilities.
