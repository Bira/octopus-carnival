In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Links to all of them will appear in the
[project page][1], which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions.

Today's template is the Knight, which means today's character is Valeros the
Fighter. Here he is:

I'm kinda torn on Valeros, to be honest. His character design and [bio][6] are
the blandest among all the Iconics I've seen, but his adaptation is very
interesting mechanically. This is because the Knight template is the complete
opposite of the d20 Fighter. It _really is_ as good at fighting as advertised,
which means its as valuable to the party as any wizard or cleric.

Anyway, from Valeros' bio linked above and his [official stats][7], we learn the
following:

- Valeros is from the nation of Andoran, his world's "18th century US"
  equivalent. He's the typical farmboy who ran away from home and towards
  adventure.

- He wears medium armor and fights with paired swords. He likes making lots of
  attacks on vulnerable enemy locations. He has a bow as a backup for ranged
  combat.

There's not much more to him. In the GURPS version we'll give him paired
broadswords because unlike d20 there's no restriction on using them here. The
Knight template didn't change much between GURPS DF and the DFRPG, but there is
one thing preventing me from just copying the original stats here: the DFRPG
lacks the Dual-Weapon Attack technique, not even in the form of a simplified
powerup. So here I replaced it with Ambidexterity and Sacrificial Parry, making
him a bit worse at attacking multiple times per action but better at protecting
his buddies.

If you have access to GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 11: Power-Ups, simply switch those
two traits for the Two-Weapon Fighting (Broadsword) advantage, which would allow
him to attack twice in a turn without penalties. His skills in this version are
also slightly different, and once again the gear list uses the new armor table.
