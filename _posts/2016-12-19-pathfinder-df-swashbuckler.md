Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder's Iconic Characters to
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**! This is the ninth post in the series. Previous

Today's template is the Swashbuckler, which means today's character is
Jirelle. Here she is:

Even if you're familiar with Pathfinder's Iconics, Jirelle might be somewhat new
to you. This is because the class she represents, the Swashbuckler, is not from
the core rules but from the "Advanced Class Guide" supplement. You can find her
bio [here][9], and the only place where I could find her stats is inside [this
free package of premade iconic characters][10] that contains all of them.

From these, we can learn the following:

- Jirelle is a half-elf born in the Shackles, a pirate-infested archipelago. She
  sunk her evil pirate's mother ship to avoid becoming a demonic sacrifice, but
  the ship and its whole crew later returned as undead. Her main long-term goal
  is returning them to the depths.

- Her fighting style is acrobatic and daring, relying a lot on precision and
  fencing skill.

- She wields a rapier as her main weapon, and despite the illustration showing
  one of every traditional off-hand fencing weapon on her person, the character
  sheet indicates the buckler is her favorite.

It turns out we have quite a bit more options when picking a template for
Jirelle than we did back when I first started writing this series! The recently
released **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Denizens: Swashbucklers** has _five_
different swashbuckler templates, each one with a slightly different focus! Now,
Jirelle's piratical background might point to the Buccaneer, but her Pathfinder
stats are all about the flashy fencing with only a slight nod towards seafaring
skills. So it turns out that the default Swashbuckler template really is the
best choice here. We just have to make sure she knows how to sail.

I'm pretty satisfied with the result! **Dungeon Fantasy** Jirelle has skill 20
with her rapier and skill 18 with her buckler, which enables some pretty cool
tricks. She also knows her way around a ship, and her Charisma helps boost her
social skills and Rapier Wit ability. Making her a better leader of men would be
a good use of earned character points, especially in parties that lack a more
dedicated social character. And of course, points spent on Rapier will never go
to waste!

Speaking of "points spent on Rapier", this version of Jirelle spends one
character point on extra starting cash so she can afford the Edged Rapier.
