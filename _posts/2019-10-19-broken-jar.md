Broken Jar was abandoned at the gates of a far-off monastery when he was a baby,
and was raised by monks his whole life. This particular monastery sends its
initiates out as mendicants once their basic training is completed, with the
intent that they return humbler and wiser after a while.

So it was with Broken Jar, who gladly started his journey. He met many of his
fellow monks who were on their way back, having judged they saw enough of the
world. He himself never quite got to that point. He always looked to the next
hill and longed to see what lay beyond it. New places to see, new people to
meet, new villains to punch. And so Broken Jar kept wandering.

Truth be told, he's not quite sure how he got here. This place is so different
from the lands of his childhood that he doesn't think he could have gotten here
with just a few weeks of hiking. Is he even in the same continent? The same
world? Finding the answer to that is sure to be fun, and in the meantime there's
so much more to see around here! This wanderer is in absolutely no rush to go
back home.

Broken Jar's specialty is fighting unarmed, or with a staff. As he is now, his
damage falls short of what a Weapon Master Knight can manage, but he does have
plenty of interesting tricks to use and can do cutting damage with while unarmed
thanks to his claws. Earned points should likely go towards increased combat
skills and power-ups that add to his unarmed damage.

The catfolk racial template I used for him is more similar to the one I wrote up
for Elder Scrolls [Khajit][1] than the one in DF: Adventurers, which is really
quite "busy" and burnened by typical "cat" psychological disadvantages that
don't really fit this particular character.
