Jade Irinka was an orphan of uncertain but numinous parentage who was adopted as
a sort of mascot by the original Silver Ravens during their early exploits. She
was too young to go out with the Ravens on their missions, but she witnessed
their results and listened to their stories with rapt attention. Jackdaw,
knowing victory would be uncertain in the final Thrune invasion, sent her away
from the city with other non-combatant friends, hoping they would be able to
come back once the fighting was over.

Things didn't turn out well, and Jade never got the chance to return. She aged
slowly but eventually reached maturity and set out to follow on the footsteps of
her heroes. Her natural charisma and skill with the sword let her achieve some
small measure of renown around the Inner Sea as an heroic adventurer.

Recent news from Cheliax convinced Jade it's finally time to return home and
take up the Ravens' fight. She doesn't remember many details about those days,
but she's confident she will find a way. Everything she's done so far has been
to prepare herself for this. As the campaign starts, she has just caught up on
the events and rumors of the last few days and decides to attend the Aria Park
protest to learn more.

## Description

As you might have guessed from her name, Jade is inspired by Jasper Irinka, the
Child of the Sun, one of the iconic characters from Chuubo's Marvelous Wish
Granting Engine. I'm using Jade instead of Jasper as the name because I like it
more - it's the name of Jasper's Mother, the Angel of the Sun.

So Jade looks almost exactly like Jasper. Dark brown skin, voluminous and fiery
red hair, green or blue eyes depending on the light. She has an athlethic build
from all her adventuring, though her equipment is somewhat less than elegant
at the moment. Unlike Jasper, she has only two arms at present and is unlikely
to grow more.

This name might also give you a hint about who her ancestors are in the
Pathfinder setting.

## Build notes

Jade's stats below are based on the Aristocrat archetype from GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy Denizens: Swashbucklers. This gives her amazing sword and leadership
skills, though I removed some of the template's more classist traits.

Her being a long-lived half-spirit is mostly a story thing for now, as I didn't
take an official template. You can use these stats for a charismatic human
swashbuckler in some other campaign without changing any numbers. If you do want
to emphasize her supernatural side, you can let her gradually take on
Half-Spirit traits with earned character points. That's what I intend to do
eventually.

Jade already has a +5 reaction bonus from almost everyone and an extra +3 from
professional fighters. I'm hoping to use earned points to increase that even
further, maxing out her Charisma, Born War-Leader talent, and perhaps even
Appearance. She's going to be the public face of the rebellion, after
all. Holiness and its attendant powers are also not out of the question in the
future, as they'd make her even better at fighting demons.
