We already saw several underground danger spots in the city. Neverdeath
Cemetery, the dungeons of Castle Never, and of course the Chasm. But there are
even more beyond those. The Mintarn mercs usually stay on the surface, so every
one of these places can be considered "dungeon-like".

## Shattered Sewers

Neverwinter had an extensive sewer system that's still largely ruined. It makes
for a great way to move about the entire city undetected, but it's hazardous to
navigate and filled with both monsters and other people who don't want to be
discovered.

## Kraken Tunnels

This is an underground complex with a floor plan that vaguely resembles an
octopus. It used to be the former headquarters of the Kraken Society, a criminal
syndicate specializing in slavery. Now it's the headquarters for the Nashers
faction of the Sons of Alagondar.

The complex is build right above an underground canal that links to the sea, and
this canal is the home of an actual kraken. The Spellplague reduced the monster
to bestial intelligence. The Society used to feed it and keep it as a guardian
beast, and the Nashers have continued the practice. The complex has several
floor openings through which the creature can attack intruders.

The kraken was trained by the Society to recognize anyone bearing an amulet with
its symbol as a friend - it attacks all who _don't_ have this amulet on
them. The Nashers know this and carry Kraken Society amulets with them when
inside the complex.

There's a tunnel here that links the Kraken Tunnels to the Dead Rats' HQ through
the sewers, which the Nashers use to talk and trade with them. The Rats don't
yet know the trick to avoiding the Kraken, but it's just a matter of time until
they find out and attempt to take over.

It's possible the Nashers might end up releasing the kraken into the river or
the docks as a sort of weapon of mass destruction if they become desperate
enough. The aboleths could also try to get to it in order to search its mind for
secrets from back when it was sapient.

## Dead Rat Hole

This is a section of the sewers that has been taken over by the Neverwinter
chapter of the Dead Rats. It's marked with gang signs gouged into the sewer
walls, and packed with both loot and trash collected by the gangers. Their
leader, Rsolk, holds court at a set of caves near the shores of
Blacklake. There's a trap here that can let the waters of the lake in and
"flush" the whole complex.

These Dead Rats are _not_ familiar with the Dead Rat Deserter PC, contrary to
what I thought before. Looks like word hasn't got to them yet. A bold Deserter
might try to infiltrate the gang and perhaps even challenge Rsolk for
leadership. This starts as a one-on-one duel but turns into a standard mass
fight once he's bloodied. And of course he flushes the lair if it looks like his
side will lose.

## Tunnels and Trenches

The sewers around the Chasm area are partly collapsed, forming trenches where
the street above was destroyed and tunnels where it hasn't. This and the influx
of non-sapient monsters provides good cover for the AbSov's smarter agents to
infiltrate the River District or to escape the city and head to Helm's Hold and
other places.
