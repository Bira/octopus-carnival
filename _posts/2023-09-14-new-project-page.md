If you've been reading this blog for a while you'll know that I've been doing a
Let's Read of the Neverwinter Campaign Setting for D&D 4e. This has been
generally less organized than the ones I did for the monster manuals, and it
didn't have a project page.

Well, now it does! If you want to see all the Let's Read Neverwinter posts
collected and neatly linked in one single place, then you can [head over
there][1].

[1]: {{ "/projects/neverwinter/" | relative_url }}
