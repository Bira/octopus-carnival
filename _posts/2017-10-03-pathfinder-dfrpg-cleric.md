In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game.  Links to all of them will appear in
the [project page][1], which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions. Also, I wish the names of the two versions were a bit less similar.

Today's template is the Cleric, which means today's star is Kyra. Here she is:

Kyra's character design is among my favorite from the Pathfinder iconics. You
can find her full bio [here][2], and her original Pathfinder
stats [here][3]. From looking at them we can see the following:

* Kyra is from Qadira, her world's Persia/Arabia equivalent. She's the sole
  survivor from a bandit raid on her farming village.

* Kyra is a cleric of [Sarenrae][4], the goddess of healing, redemption,
  honesty, and the sun. She teaches her devotees to always seek to redeem those
  who follow the path of evil, and to destroy them if that proves impossible.

* She wields a scimitar, her deity's favored weapon. Her cleric spells generally
  have a "light, fire and healing" theme, and she possesses the typical D&D
  cleric ability to turn undead.

The [original][5] version used the modified Sun Cleric template from GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy 7: Clerics, but here we have no choice but to go with the basic
Cleric template from the DFRPG boxed set. That's not a bad thing, however! It
turns out that the Cleric spell list has been tweaked to include a bit more
righteous burnination, so it ends up being quite close to that of the Sun Cleric.

## Design Notes

Kyra spent 1 point in extra starting cash to afford the scimitar (which has the
same stats as a broadsword). Her mandatory "holy" disadvantage is the Vow, which
means she must always offer enemies a chance to surrender and repent, and only
fight those who refuse. This is about as inconvenient as the Pacifism (Cannot
Harm Innocents) disadvantage from the GURPS Basic Set, and so is worth the same.

She also has the Diplomacy and Riding (Horse) skills, which make sense for her
and are in the rules despite not being on the template.

### Changes from the First Iteration

The Psychic Guidance perk doesn't exist in the boxed set, so it was replaced by
1 level of Resist Evil and she had to spend points on Innate Attack for her
Sunbolt spell. And while Kyra was indeed able to keep most of her spell list she
still had to trade Ignite Fire (which is not on the list) and Continual Sunlight
(which is not in the box at all) for Resist Cold and Glow, respectively.

Kyra's armor loadout also changed significantly, since mail is much more
expensive when using the rules from the boxed set. She also lost the bow and
arrows, relying on Sunbolts for ranged attacks.
