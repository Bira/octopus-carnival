In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Links to all of them will appear in the
[project page][1], which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions.

Today's template is the Scout, not because it's in order but because it's the
one I've written. This means today's character is Harsk the Ranger. Here he is:

Just Look at all that compressed rage! His [bio][7] does give him plenty to be
angry about. Harsk's official stats are [here][8]. From these we can learn the
following:

- Harsk is a Dwarf from Varisia, a "wild frontier" region that doesn't have any
  blatant ties to real-world cultures. He was a bit of an outsider to his own
  stereotypically Dwarven community, and appointed himself a keeper of justice
  in the wild places after his brother was killed by raiding giants.

- He carries his brother's axe with him, but his preferred weapon is a heavy
  crossbow he made himself. Understandably, he has giants as a favored enemy and
  gains bonuses to fight them.

- He's skilled in wilderness survival, particularly in mountains, and very
  perceptive.

This puts us in something of a pickle. DF Scouts are excellent at shooting bows,
but Harsk's preferred weapon is the _crossbow_. While that's much more in line
with the dwarven idiom, it's not supported by the standard Scout template in
**Adventurers**. Fortunately, it's possible for me to add new material to
support him without copying anything printed in other GURPS books! Even in
standard GURPS the traits below were only sort of _implied_, so I also had to do
this for the [previous version][2] of the character.

### Heroic Crossbowman (20 points)

This is just like Heroic Archer, but for crossbows instead of bows. You can
choose this version _instead_ of Heroic Archer when making a Scout. It gives
almost exactly the same bonuses: simply replace the Bow skill with Crossbow
where applicable. The only difference is that there isn't a corresponding Weapon
Master specialty for crossbows. All other advantages described under Special
Scout Traits are compatible with this one.

### Quick Reload (1 point)

If you have Heroic Crossbowman, you can also purchase this advantage. It allows
you to reload a crossbow of your ST or lower in a _single turn_ with a
successful Fast-Draw (Arrow) row, reducing the total ready time of the weapon
from 4 to 2 seconds: one to reload, one bring the weapon into position. If you
do this and use Heroic Crossbowman's fast-firing technique, you can fire your
crossbow every turn!

## Design Notes

Strongbow and Lifting ST 2 allow Harsk to fire a ST _17_ crossbow despite only
having ST 13. While he's also a pretty good axe fighter in a pinch, his main
focus is reaching out and touching people from very far away.

### Changes from the First Iteration

The dwarf racial template changed slightly, and following the **DFRPG**
guidelines I just mixed its traits in with the professional template rather than
taking the time to mark what belongs to the racial template and what
doesn't. And since there's no general purpose Mortal Foe trait here, this
version of Harsk doesn't have it. Instead, he sees in the dark a lot better, and
is able to shoot a bigger crossbow.

His gear actually doesn't change all that much, as he only had a DR 1 leather
jacket before too. There's no tea set listed in DFRPG, I believe, but I didn't
think there would be any harm in keeping it.

[^1]: +1 from Pickaxe Penchant.
[^2]: +2 from Outdoorsman.
