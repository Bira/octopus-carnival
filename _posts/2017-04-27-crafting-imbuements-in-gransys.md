[Pyramid #3/102][1] was recently published, and it contains a system for making
magic items that would be an excellent alternative to [the one I wrote][0] for
the Dragon's Dogma setting! It has the advantage of better fitting the theme of
"master crafters using alchemy to improve equipment" that I was going for, and
it uses the Imbuement system in a way that doesn't bog down fights

The system can be used mostly as written, with only a couple small changes
required to make it fit in Gransys. The Imbue advantage necessary for the
process always has the Alchemical (-10%) modifier.

- A piece of gear can be improved after its creation! Use the original item's
  value, unmodified by pre-existing Cost Factors, to calculate the cost of
  the new change.
- The special components described [in my post][0] can be used to pay up to half
  of the imbuement's cost, using the same rate. They also reduce the time
  necessary for Infuse Gear by a similar rate, and if the PC provices enough
  components to completely cover the cost the infusion could be done by the same
  day. The artisan would still charge half its price in that case, though.

And since it's possible to improve the base quality of pre-existing gear in
Gransys, the following skill would make itself necessary:

## Refined Gear (General; IQ/VH)

This skill improves the _mundane_ quality of a piece of gear. Cheap gear becomes
Good quality, Good gear becomes Fine, Fine Gear becomes Very Fine. The change in
CF is the same one for buying an item of that quality.

_Modifiers:_ +2 to make a Cheap item Good; -5 to make an item Very Fine. Jumping
multiple quality levels in one sitting requires multiple simultaneous uses of
this Imbuement at the usual -1 penalty per use.
