Way back in the olden days of 2017, I published a post presenting the
[Warforged][1] of D&D and Eberron fame as a racial template for the Dungeon
Fantasy RPG. I'm still particularly proud of that post, and have used it in
actual play, but I also think I can expand upon it a bit now. So here's a couple
variant warforged templates.

In this [2018 post][2] where I explained how I came up with the stats for the
peoples of Tamriel, I mentioned that I'm no longer a fan of including attribute
adjustments and mental or cultural disadvantages in GURPS racial templates. The
original 2017 Warforged template still includes both, even though it's a bit
more restrained with them. So our first variant is an updated template that
removes those adjustments. It ends up being cheaper! Our second variant adds a
lens on top of that.

## Warforged (20 points)

All of the story-related descriptions remain the same as in the [original
post][1].

**Advantages**: Composite Plating 1 {5}; Doesn't Breathe {20}; Doesn't Eat or
Drink {10}; Unsleeping Watcher {10}.

**Disadvantages**: Dependency (Mana, Constantly) {-25}.

As mentioned in the [original post][1], Composite Plating is simply DR 1 without
the Though Skin limitation, and Unsleeping Watcher is Less Sleep 4 with a +25%
enhancement that allows the character to remain conscious during their sleep
period. Check out the link for more flavorful and detailed descriptions.

### Lens: Dreaming Doll (-2 points)

This lens represent living constructs that do require actual sleep, though they
still require less of it than us fleshbags. This replaces Unsleeping Watcher {10}
with standard Less Sleep 4 {8}. The character is not aware of their surroundings
when sleeping, but they are capable of dreaming.

This is an interesting lens if you want a character who resembles the Doll from
Bloodborne more than a standard Eberron warforged.

## Warforged Gifts

These optional traits are available to any warforged. They are individual rather
than racial traits.

The optional traits from the [original article][1] remain options
here, and are still good to represent the social awkwardness of recently
activated individuals.

Warforged with access to the proper tools could spend 5 points/level to increase
their innate DR up to 3. The same tools might allow them to change their outward
appearance and presentation in ways that let them acquire levels in the
Appearance advantage.

Characters wanting more protection might buy the Accessory (Armor Hardpoints)
perk for 1 point. This lets them use custom armor that weights 25% less than the
normal humanoid version, but can't be used by others or removed on the
fly. Attaching or removing this custom armor can only be done in town. It costs
the same as the normal equivalent. Warforged with the perk can still choose to
wear normal armor, but can't wear normal and attached armor together on the same
location.
