[Lich van Winkle's Return to Gaming][1] is a rather interesting blog I found
through [Dungeon Fantastic][2]. Its author started role-playing with D&D basic
back in 1981, stopped around the mid-90's, and is now coming back to the hobby
after a 25-year hiatus.

I found some of the post titles there interesting enough, and the blog itself is
new enough, that I'm reading it from the beginning. The [first post][3] proves
that it's going to be an interesting ride, because this is someone who played
back when the old school was new and who says that "there is a lot of
myth-making in the OSR". Me, I started playing shortly before Mr. van Winkle
here stopped, but I think I'll find plenty to agree with.
