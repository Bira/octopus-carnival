This is an entry in the Dragon's Dogma bestiary. The remaining entries along
with the full adaptation can be found [here][0].

Gryphons are considered a symbol of strength and victory in Gransys, much like
in the real world. These creatures used to be considered mythical, but the
coming of the Dragon has proved otherwise. One such beast has taken roost in the
ancient ruins of Bluemoon Tower, and ranges as far as Gran Soren in its search
for prey, devastating herds of cattle and attacking unwary caravans. There might
be others.

The Basic Set actually has stats for a gryphon in page B461, but those would
only suit a smaller than average individual in this setting. The gryphon of
Bluemoon Tower is much larger, and able to carry a grown person away with
ease. It's also clever enough to fly away if it thinks itself overmatched, so
hunting it has proven particularly difficult. Ending its threat would mean
undertaking an expedition to Bluemoon Tower and facing the many dangers therein.

**ST** 25; **DX** 14; **IQ** 5; **HT** 13

  as a weapon.
- **Flyby Attack (-)**: The Gryphon can perform a Move and Attack maneuver to
  swoop down, strike with its talons, and fly back up, covering a distance equal
  to its Air Move in total. The attacks are made at no penalty. The talon attack
  can be a _grapple_ instead, which if successful means the gryphon carries the
  victim with it.

## Gryphon Variants

### Cockatrice

Unlike the small variant presented in **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 3**, the
Gransys cockatrice is a huge creature that looks like a gryphon from far
away. Upon closer inspection, one can see its avian half resembles more a turkey
or buzzard than an eagle, with black feathers and fur.

In addition to possessing the same natural weapons as a gryphon, the cockatrice
can spew a cloud of noxious gas that turns any who breathe it to stone! And
unlike the gryphon, it will never run from a fight.

Use the same stats as for a gryphon, but add the following attack:

- **Petrifying Breath (16 vs. HT)**: Covers an area 5m in diameter in front of
  the cockatrice. Any who fail the listed resistance roll are turned to stone as
  per the Flesh to Stone spell. Can be used once every 10 seconds.
