This post is part of a series converting Dragon's Dogma enemies to **GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy**. Please go [here][1] for links to all other posts in the
series.

Not even [goblins][2] are as annoying as the wolves of Gransys. The original
game's suicidally aggressive monster AI combined with the move set of the "wolf"
monster family ensures that even basic wolves remain a nuisance long after
they've stopped being a threat. It doesn't help that your pawns will helpfully
expound on anti-wolf tactics for even the easiest such encounter. Hopefully the
tabletop version will be a little better in that regard. This article covers all
sorts of canine enemies, but we start with the most basic of them all:

## Wolves

The southern forests and mountain passes of Gransys are home to packs of large,
brownish wolves. Most of the time, they stay away from civilization and restrict
their hunting to other wild animals further down the food chain. A wolf pack
will only target livestock if no wild prey is available, and will only attack
people if they are utterly desperate. Unfortunately, both situations have become
more common ever since increased bandit and goblin presence in Southern Gransys
made game scarcer.

Use the Wolf stats from p. **B458** for average wolves, and the more powerful
Hound and Timber Wolf stats from **DF 5** p. 9 for large specimens (of which
there is at least one per pack encountered).

## Dire Wolves

The colder northern reaches of Gransys are home to a larger and more vicious
white-furred species of wolf. The _smallest_ of them use the Hound template from
**DF 5**, and they frequently get up to the size shown in **DF 2**, p. 22. While
they mostly stick to wild prey deep in the woods, they are much more confident
about targetting livestock and humans who wander into their territory.

## Wargs

These horrible creatures look like standard wolves from a distance, but closer
inspection will reveal their true natures. Wargs are _undead_ wolves, with
rotted-through hides and infected bites. Forget any semblance of realistic
behavior here - they hang out in tombs and dungeons and prefer their meals to be
sapient and alive at the time of eating.

To make a warg, take a normal or dire wolf and change its class to
Undead. Change DR to 4, add Injury Tolerance (Unliving), and add a 1d toxic
follow-up to their bite, resisted with HT-2.

## Hell Hounds

_These_ horrors are stirred up by the coming of the Dragon, and enter the world
through the same portal as it. They are even more untroubled my mundane
physiology than wargs: their blood boils, and they breathe fire at will.

To make a hell hound, take a normal or dire wolf and change its class to
Demon. Change DR to 5 (15 vs. Fire), add Injury Tolerance (Homogenous), and a
2d Burning Innate Attack with the Cone enhancement. The cone is three yards wide
at its widest. They can use this attack _at will_, and are happy to do so since
they don't need to worry about friendly fire!

## Wolves Hunt in Packs!

All enemies described in this article fight in a similar way. The pack attempts
to surround the target, and some of the wolves will distract it with growls and
feints so that others can bite from unexpected angles. They usually know their
territory fairly well, and might try to herd a particularly mobile victim to a
spot they can't run away from.

All "wolf"-like enemies should have the Wrestling skill even if that's not
listed in their original stats, at a level equal to the highest of their
Brawling or DX. They like to use that to grab their targets with a bite and pull
them to the ground, enabling the rest of the pack to move in and gang up on the
victim.
