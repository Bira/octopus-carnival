In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game.  Links to all of them will appear in
the [project page][1], which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions.

Today's template is the Holy Warrior, which means today's character is Seelah
the Paladin. Here she is:

Cool, huh? She's my second favorite design so far, losing only to Kyra (Lini is
a close third). Her [bio][5], however, is by far the best. It's quite tragic,
but seems to hit a good balance between "biblical" and "Arthurian". Her official
stats are [here][6]. From these we can learn the following:

- Seelah is a paladin of Iomedae the Inheritor, a Lawful Good deity of justice
  and protection. She wears heavy armor and fights with sword and shield, with a
  bow kept in reserve.

- She has the usual varied suite of paladin powers, the ones most emphasized are
  her fearlessness, her ability to smite evil, and her healing hands, in that
  order.

- While Seelah goes after all manner of evil foes, she fights fiends and evil
  dragons with particular fervor.

Given Iomedae's description as the goddess of justice and valor, the Holy
Warrior template fits her quite well. This Seelah has _almost_ all of the
abilities of a standard D&D Paladin. She lacks a "Lay on Hands" ability because
its DFRPG equivalent, Faith Healing, is quite expensive. However, she's still
absolutely fearless, supernaturally resistant to disease, can channel divine
might to enhance her strength, and is particularly adept at fighting demons.

## What Changed From Last Iteration

Seelah was almost the opposite of Lini, in that pretty much nothing changed
point-wise between the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy and DFRPG versions. All the skills
and abilities she has exist in the boxed set and work pretty much the same. The
skills of this version are slightly different, but that was a personal decision
rather than having to work around something that was missing from the books.

Her gear is the biggest change here, but even this was generally for the
better. While her armor has a bit less DR than in the first version, the overall
loadout is much lighter, leaving her at Medium Encumbrance instead of Heavy.
