In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic chracters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Links to all of them will appear in
the [project page][1], which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions. Also, I wish the names of the two versions were a bit less similar.

Our second subject is Lem the Bard. Here he is:

You can find his full bio [here][lem-bio], and his original Pathfinder stats can
be found [here][lem-stats]. From looking at them we can see the following:

* Lem was born a slave in the devil-worshipping nation of Cheliax. He escaped in
  a rather fiery fashion.

* He hates slavery and slavers, and tends to side with the underdog in most
  conflicts.

* Lem has a sling and a shortsword, both sized for a halfling, but prefers to
  use his magic in a fight. He mostly uses his bard song to bolster his allies,
  and targets particularly tough foes with hindering spells to make them easier
  to take down.

Here's what he looks like in the DFRPG rules:

## Design Notes

I find that this new iteration of Lem doesn't match the original d20 stats quite
as closely as the first one, despite still being a very serviceable DFRPG
bard. Let's take a look at what changed to see why.

### Changes from the First Iteration

You can see the original version [here][2]. As I said above, this iteration is a
bit less faithful to the d20 stats than the first, and the main reason for this
is that the Alarum song is not in the DFRPG. That's the song that bolsters your
allies in combat, matching the effect of the basic d20 Bard Song power. In its
place, he gets the Song of Terror and the Song of Echoes. This means that his
general tactics stay the same, but now he focuses on scaring away his enemies
rather than strengthening his allies.

There are several other changes, but they're more beneficial. Lem now has a few
more skills, and his musical skills in particular are higher because the Musical
Ability advantage has been rolled into Bardic Talent. His Terror spell was
removed because the Terror Song already does the same thing a bit better.

The other big change here is in his equipment. GURPS Dungeon Fantasy had
detailed rules for under-sized gear to fit smaller races, and those are absent
from the DFRPG. This means that all of Lem's gear is human-sized or, in the case
of his clothing, has the same cost and weight as the human sized version.

The good news is that his weapons do the more damage, though since he still has
ST 8 his songs and spells are still a better option. The bad news is that he's
carrying a lot more weight and is at Light Encumbrance by default. And since
even basic enchantments cost a lot more, he loses the Fortify enchantment in his
clothes.
