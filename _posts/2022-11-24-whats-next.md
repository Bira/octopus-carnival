Oh hey, turns out I've posted the last entry in my Monster Manual 3 Let's Read!
It's officially finished! Yay!

I'm not done reading monster books yet, though. Next up on my list is **Monster
Vault: Threats to the Nentir Vale**, the last "proper" monster book for D&D 4th
Edition. I really like it, and I hope you do to!

This one's going to be a bit different from the other projects. Entries for
those were posted first to the [RPG.net forum][1], and then here after a
delay. Since I was, er, less than optimally organized in updating this blog,
some times that delay was considerable.

I've gotten better about updating both the forum and the blog, though, and now
that the MM3 reading is finished, the Threats one will be posted in sync between
the two starting a couple of days from now.

I'll also keep posting about other subjects, though those posts might be a
little more spaced out since I don't have a buffer of them. I'll write as the
muse strikes, as always.
