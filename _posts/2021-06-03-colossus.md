## The Lore

As we saw back in the [Colossus entry for the Monster Manual][2], colossi are at
the top of the tech tree for traditional constructs, and only gods and
near-divine spellcasters have the power to create them. They're the kind of
thing that was used as a weapon in the Dawn War. Well, here we learn that the
gods weren't the only side of that war that could make colossi.

In the post linked above, I made a reference to the giant monsters from the
Shadow of the Colossus game. The primordial colossus we're looking at here fits
them much better than the godforged variant from the first Manual.

Most primordial colossi were created at the time of the Dawn War, and being as
ageless as their creators they still exist today. Some roam the planes seeking
to fulfill the orders of their long-gone masters, but others lie dormant looking
for all the world like shattered ruins or broken parts of the landscape. When
someone approaches them, they rise and smash the intruder.

The magic that goes into a primordial colossus is a little wilder and less
controlled than the one that goes into the god-forged variant. The principles
behind it are such that a primordial colossus might be created _by accident_
in any event that causes the release of a massive amount of elemental
energy. This includes the awakening or destruction of a mighty elemental
being. It's also possible for an epic spellcaster to acquire and perform the
ritual to create one of these constructs.

## The Numbers

Once again we get a single stat block here, so let's get right to it.

### Primordial Colossus

This baby is a Huge Elemental Animate with the Construct keyword, and a Level 29
Elite Brute with 640 HP. It's immune to disease, fear, poison and sleep, and has
a Variable Elemental Resistance 15 switchable 3 times per encounter. Its ground
speed is 10.

Primordial colossi really lean into that mechanic for composite energy
damage. They have an **Elemental Presence** aura (5) that deals 15 damage of the
"acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder" type to anyone caught inside. You
need resistance to all five types in order to not take full damage from it.

Their basic **slams** do physical damage, but they likely prefer to use a
**Colossal Slam** maneuver (close blast 3 vs. AC), which does the same damage
over an area and triggers a secondary attack vs. Fortitude that does a bit of
extra five-type elemental damage.

When an enemy moves adjacent to the colossus, it can use a **Reactive Kick** as
a reaction, targetting Fortitude, doing a good bit of five-type damage, pushing
the target 4 squares and knocking it prone. This recharges once the colossus is
first bloodied.

Staying away does you no good, since it can throw **Primordial Stones** (Ranged
20 vs. Reflex) that do only a bit less damage than the slam and have a secondary
area attack (Close Burst 5 vs. Fortitude) which does that sweet five-type
damage.

## Sample Encounters and Final Impressions

The two sample encounters have primordial colossi guarding ancient ruins
alongside other similarly powerful apotropaics:

- Level 26: 1 primordial colossus, 2 great flameskulls, 1 slaughterstone
  hammerer.

- Level 27: 1 primordial colossus, 1 primordial naga.

Maybe an epic adventure centered on Far Realm opposition could have some
horrible aberrant secret guarded by both godforged and primordial colossi -
something so terrible the gods and primordials actually joined forces to
protect.

Mechanically, I find those Big Balls of Elemental Damage in the colossus' stat
block to be a lot of fun. It's so hard to resist you'd get the same result by
just using straight physical damage, but describing it this way reinforces the
elemental nature of the creature... and you get to see the look on your players'
faces as you announce they took acid, cold, fire lightning and thunder damage.
