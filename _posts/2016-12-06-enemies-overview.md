By now we have a pretty complete picture of what the PCs in a GURPS Dragon's
Dogma look like. They can use almost any default **Dungeon Fantasy** template,
or choose to be [Magic Archers][1] and [Mystic Knights][2]. They can be normal
humans, or [Pawns and Arisen][3]. They can equip themselves with
a [variety of gear][4] and they can use a unique form of alchemy to make that
gear [more powerful][5]. And we know they'll spend quite a bit of time fighting
a variety of enemies and relieving them of their treasure. But exactly who are
these enemies? This is what we'll examine in the next few articles!

The original game has a huge variety of interesting monsters to fight, and this
is something I feel a GURPS adaptation should strive to match. In true JRPG
fashion, they are divided into several "families" defined by what model they
use, and you meet more powerful members of those families as you progress in the
game. Those are a good starting point for organizing the monsters and defining
how to split them among future articles. After looking at the spoilerific
[Bestiary][6] entry in the Dragon's Dogma wiki and rearranging things a bit, we
come to the following list:

- [Humans][7]
- Goblins
- Wolves
- Saurians
- Undead
- Beholders
- Gargoyles
- Harpies
- Cyclopes
- Chimerae
- Ogres
- Griffins and Cockatrices
- Golems
- Hydras
- Dragons

This entries are written in the order I'll tackle each of them. The idea is to
include GURPS stats for all members of that monster family, either as full stat
blocks or as variants for a basic stat block. They will also include some
information on where the monster can be found in Gransys and what impact its
existence has in our adaptation's setting. As articles are written for each
entry, I'll come back to this post and add the proper links.

It's important to note that these aren't the _only_ monsters that exist in the
setting, just the ones that show up on the original game. Anything could be
lurking in those dungeons! The GM is free to include additional monsters from
the DF line or other sources, or to use these in a generic DF setting.
