I'm still working on the next post in the Dragon's Dogma Bestiary, but I saw
something neat today and thought I had to share it and make a few comments of my
own.

The Hard Maths blog has an interesting article on [Elemental Melee Spells][1]
up. These create weapons of pure energy from nothing, and might be an
interesting addition to the arsenal of a [Mystic Knight][2]!

Such a character would probably value mystical power more than physical might,
as the spells don't add to the users ST for damage and a final skill level of
15+ is vital for maintaining them for any appreciable length of time. They also
need Force Sword, a skill which would have no other use in a fantasy
setting... which means there's a secretive order of elementalists that teaches
it along with the spells somewhere out there.
