Blizzard Dragons were created by Umboras, Lord of the Rimefire. The dragon
petitioners who approached this primordial were the coldest-hearted among their
number. Umboras took them to the coldest reaches of the Elemental Chaos and
entombed them there for a year and a day while he worked his magic on them. When
they emerged, they were blizzard dragons.

Umboras had a specific goal in mind when he did this. He had been an ally of the
winter goddess Khala, who shared with him the goal of freezing the world
solid. However, the Raven Queen had just usurped Khala and claimed the domain of
winter from her, so Umboras was out for revenge. He created blizzard dragons to
help transport his troops to the Raven Queen's new home of Letherna.

The Queen, however, was smarter than him. She retreated to the labyrinthine
astral domain of Pandemonium, and used its twisty little passages (all alike) to
separate Umboras from his main forces and lock him in one of the domain's empty
vaults. He's still there!

The blizzard dragons scattered after their master was imprisoned. Some stayed in
Pandemonium, some returned to the Elemental Chaos, some even went to the coldest
places of the world. For obvious reasons, though, you'll rarely find one of them
in the Shadowfell.

Blizzard dragons don't usually have grand plans of their own, and are usually
content to freeze and sculpt their territories. However, they're surprisingly
good team players and can often be found allied to other creatures of compatible
disposition, helping them achieve their goals. This varies from the usual frost
giants and ice archons to liches or winter fey, depending on the individual. And
they're always down for breaking a primordial out of prison.

## The Numbers

Blizzard dragons are Elemental Magical Beasts with the Cold and Dragon
keywords. They have Darkvision, Ice Walk, and a clumsy flight speed. All of
their attacks do cold damage, even the bites and claws.

### Blizzard Dragon Wyrmling

Wyrmlings are Medium, making them the smallest dragons I've seen in my Let's
Read so far. They're Level 2 Controllers with 38 HP. They have ground and air
speeds of 6.

Yeah, that's right, wyrmlings are _regulars_. This means they'll almost always
be found cooperating with a sizable group of other monsters. The most obvious
candidates are their clutch-siblings, but they're smart enough to strike an
alliance with lots of other people.

They are surrounded by an aura (1) of **Freezing Wind**. Enemies that end their
turn inside are slid 1 square. When hit by a cold attack, the wyrmling reacts
with **Sudden Flurry**, immediately sliding all enemies inside its aura 1
square.

Their **bite** immobilizes, and their **claws** slide the target 1 square on a
hit. While they're bloodied, **Wyrmling Fury** allows them to spend an action to
attack with both.

### Young Blizzard Dragon

Young'uns grow to size Large, and become Level 7 Elite Controllers with 166
HP. Their speed increases to 8.

They have all of the wyrmling's abilities with a few differences and
additions. The simplest one is that Wyrmling Flurry is replaced by a standard
Double Attack ability, and their claws slide 2 squares.

Unlike other dragons, blizzards don't have a breath weapon. Instead, when
they're hit by a melee attack, a high-pressure blast of frozen liquid bursts
forth from the wound. This is written as a reaction named **Chill Rebuke**, a
Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude. It deals cold damage and slows on a hit (save
ends).

This is also where the "living disaster" mechanic kicks in. Here it's an ability
named **Rising Winds**. Once this is activated as a minor action, it causes the
size of the dragon's Freezing Wind aura to grow to 3. At the start of the
dragon's next turn, it automatically expands again, to 5. And at the start of
the following turn, the dragon makes a Close Burst 5 attack vs. Fortitude, with
a hit dealing cold damage, slowing, and blinding the targets. Once the attack is
resolved, the aura returns to is initial size of 1 and Rising Winds recharges.

### Adult/Elder Blizzard Dragon

Adults and elders are identical to young'uns, with bigger numbers. Adults are
Level 12 Elite Controllers with 252 HP, and Elders are Level 17 with 338
HP.

Elders are Huge and can move at speed 10. They can slide enemies 3 squares with
their claws and 2 squares with their auras. Their Rising Winds attack restrains
instead of immobilizing.

### Ancient Blizzard Dragon

Ancients are Huge in size, and are Level 22 Elite Controllers with 422
HP. They're almost idendical to elders, with bigger numbers. They also have a
new encounter power named **Deep Freeze** that works kinda like a breath weapon,
though I guess it's more of a high-pressure blood ejection, since the dragon
must be bloodied to use it.

This ability attacks enemies in a Close Burst 5, targetting Fortitude. A hit
deals cold damage, immobilizes, and imposes a -5 penalty to Fortitude (save ends
both). A miss deals half damage and imposes the same penalty for a single
turn. All of the dragon's non-basic attacks target Fortitude, so this penalty
makes it a lot more dangerous while it lasts.

## Final Impressions

Blizzard dragons feel like they slide into the exact same niche as white
dragons, with a similar cold theme and a similarly unpleasant
personality. Blizzards are smarter and not technically evil, but they still make
for terrible neighbors.

Mechanically, they _feel_ like dragons and like cold themed creatures without
actually using any of the signature mechanics for either! This is a dragon that
does not have a breath attack or a fear aura, and a cold creature that is not
immune to cold. It's fascinating!
