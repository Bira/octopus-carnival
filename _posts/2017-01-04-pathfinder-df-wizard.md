Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder's Iconic Characters to
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**! This is the eleventh and final post in the
series. Previous entries can be found here:

- [Amiri the Barbarian][1]
- [Lem the Bard][2]
- [Kyra the Cleric][3]
- [Lini the Druid][4]
- [Seelah the Paladin][5]

- [Harsk the Ranger][7]
- [Sajan the Monk][8]
- [Jirelle the Swashbuckler][9]
- [Merisiel the Rogue][10]

Today's template is the Wizard, which means today's character is Ezren. Here he
is:

This is a fairly tame design, especially when compared to some of the other
characters in this series. Ezren's bio is [here][11], and his stats
are [here][12]. From these we can learn the following:

- Ezren got into adventuring late in life, after wasting his youth trying to
  clear his father of corruption charges that turned out to be true. He learned
  his wizardry mostly by himself, as no teacher wanted an apprentice his age.

- He's the blastier sort of wizard, devoting a large portion of his spell
  selection to delivering direct damage. The remainder is split between
  self-buffing and non-damaging hostile spells (like _grease_ and _obscuring
  mist_).

- His preferred weapon is a cane, and at higher levels he carries plenty of
  magical jewelry.

Converting Ezren into a **Dungeon Fantasy** character is fairly straightforward:
he's just a standard human Wizard. His advanced age doesn't change anything
about his starting stats, and aging rolls aren't a factor in a **DF** game. It
did give me an excuse to load him up with physical disadvantages that hint at
his frail physique while keeping his mind sharp. His spell selection is actually
pretty close to the original stats, with fire, lightning and acid attack spells,
Shield and Armor for protection, and Grease for control. He also has some nasty
area denial options in the form of Stench and Fire Cloud, as well as a bunch of
more specialized effects that fill out the prerequisites for the more powerful
stuff. His starting power item is his cane, which can be used in combat with the
Smallsword skill in emergencies.

Good advancement options for Ezren are mainly more Magery and spells. Keeping a
character point or two in reserve is a good way to pick up additional spells
mid-delve via Wild Talent, too! While he has a bunch of spells that require
Innate Attack, some players might find it better to replace that skill with
multiple purchases of the Psychic Guidance perk found in **DF 11**, p. 15.
