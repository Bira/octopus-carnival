In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Links to all of them will appear in the
[project page][1], which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions.

Today's template is the Thief, which means today's character is Merisiel. Here
she is:

Merisiel has all the knives. _All of them_. We're back in familiar territory
with her, as she's one of the Iconics from the core book. Her bio is [here][10]
and her stats are [here][11]. From these, we can learn the following:

- Merisiel is one of the Forlorn, an elf raised among humans. They get this
  depressing name because Pathfinder elves are of the type that takes nearly a
  century to grow up. She spent these decades as a street urchin who stowed away
  on ships bound for different cities when her current buddies outgrew her.

- She's not the sharpest knife in the drawer but makes up for that by carrying a
  lot of really sharp knives on her person. She tries to start every combat
  hidden, to better backstab her foes.

- Merisiel has an open and expressive personality, always tries to have fun in
  the moment, and is always chasing the next get-rich-quick scheme.

Despite being pretty much a bog-standard d20/Pathfinder character, Merisiel
presents us with several interesting challenges when it comes to adapting her to
the Dungeon Fantasy RPG.

First of all, she's an elf, but not the woodsy type of elf shown in DFRPG:
Adventurers. No, she's a _Forlorn_ elf, which means she grew up among humans and
had no contact with elven culture to speak of. The racial template from
Adventurers that best models this is actually the _Half-Elf_, down to the
problems they have in relating to both humans and elves. She's not an actual
half-breed, but the effects of Social Stigman (Forlorn Elf) would be pretty much
the same. And theorietically she would have a much longer lifespan than a
half-elf, but that's not worth any points in Dungeon Fantasy campaigns.

The other challenge is that the Thief professional template from Advanturers is
built to resemble the Thief class of early D&D - a middling combatant who's
great at stealth, trap-finding, and reaching difficult places. The d20 Rogue
class is still good at these non-combat things, but its main focus is stabbing
monsters in the back for massive damage. This is why Merisiel's Pathfinder stats
give her a rapier despite her bio's focus on knives - it's the best melee weapon
for rogues in that system. Fortunately, the list of Thief-appropriate traits in
Adventurers gives us tools to fix this discrepancy.

As a result, Merisiel's DX and IQ are both a point lower than you would expect
for an elf thief, to make room for the extra stabby (Ambidexterity, Weapon
Master, Expert Backstabber, and increased combat skills). She's still quite a
bit sharper than her original bio indicates, though it might not be apparent to
someone who witnessed her failing two or more self-control rolls.

This version of Merisiel is almost identical to her GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
counterpart, with the biggest variation being her armor. She's now at Light
Encumbrance, and must drop the backpack before entering a fight to avoid combat
penalties.

Our advancement options here are many. As a member of a "skill monkey"
profession Merisiel can always use more and higher skills. Players who want to
save points for a while might want to consider buying back that "lost" IQ
point for this reason. Those who want to make her stabbier would do well to add
a couple points of ST for that sweet 2d swing damage, and more Expert
Backstabber would make her sneak attacks even better. Spending treasure on a
lighter loadout and better-quality knives would also bring a lot of benefit to
the character.
