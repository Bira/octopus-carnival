We're done with monsters for now, and we're getting into a section about
terrain.

Terrain is as important a building block for a fun encounters as the monsters
that make it up, and this section has some uniquely Dark and Sunny examples for
you to add to your battlemaps.

## Barbed Cacti

Even when they don't uproot themselves to hunt you down, Athasian cacti can
still be dangerous. These specimens have sharp spines that break off and stay
stuck to you. Lines of barbed cactus squares can be used to cordon off some
areas of the battlefield, and provide an excellent barrier for artillery
monsters to hide behind.

Entering a square of barbed cacti deals 3 damage and inflices -2 to attack rolls
(save ends).

## Brambleweed

Like barbed cacti, but worse. Brambleweed grows in sprawling thickets that can
thrive even in defiled areas, because they can use the blood or corpses of
captured creatures as nourishment. Some defilers plant them intentionally as
defensive measures in their lairs.

A creature that ends their turn in a brambleweed square is restrained until the
end of their next turn. A creature that _starts_ their turn there (which they
will if they were restrained) takes 5/tier damage.

## Defiled Terrain

This is a more varied category describing several possibilities for what might
remain behind after a major act of defiling. It can be used as pre-existing
terrain in an area what was subject to defiling in the past, or you can place it
in the middle of the fight after someone uses Arcane Defiling or an equivalent
power.

### Ash Field

These are the remains of plant life caught in a defiling field. Sometimes the
wind causes them to pool in terrain depressions to form areas of Settled Ash,
which can act as a terrain feature.

Someone who's adjacent to a square of settled ash can make an Athletics test to
raise a cloud of it, which functions as a blast attack vs. Fortitude that blinds
for a turn on a hit.

### Black Sand

The residue of defiling mixed in with the local soil. People standing on black
sand only regain half the normal amount of HP from healing effects. Wasn't there
an entire geographical region covered in the stuff?

### Dead Magic

Areas that have lost so much to defiling that they have nothing left to
give. Anyone standing on dead magic squares takes a -5 penalty to attack with
arcane or primal powers, and is barred from using Arcane Defiling.

The book recommends being careful with dead magic areas, particularly if there
are a lot of arcane and primal PCs in the party. Usually only very powerful
defilers are capable of creating them.

### Sickening Heat

This is either a mystical side effect of defiling, or it could just be a natural
consequence of killing all that plant cover. Creatures ending their turn on
these squares are weakened for a turn.

This terrain can do a number on your party's strikers, and monsters who have the
ability to inflict forced movement simply love it.

## Glimmering Mirage

Mundane mirages are the effect of heat haze in the distance. These ones are more
than that: they're illusions crafted by malicious primal spirits. In addition to
luring travelers, they persist once they get closer, and can conceal all kinds
of danger behinds their alluring façades.

Glimmering mirages form walls 4 or more squares long. They block line of sight,
and give concealment against ranged attacks to anyone standing adjacent to
them. At the end of every turn, you roll a d6 for each mirage. A 1 means it's
gone, a 6 means it moves 5 squares, and other results mean it stays put.

## Lightning Pillar

Literally a pillar of congealed lightning, probably created due to the area's
proximity to an "electric" region of the Elemental Chaos. PCs and enemies might
be able to use their Arcana, Nature, or Religion skills to "hack" such a pillar
and make it deliver a lightning strike to a chosen target.

## Mudflats

These are natural areas where underground water surfaces a bit and mixes with
the soil, creating an area that is both dusty and sludgy at the same
time. Inland mudflats are the next best thing to oases, and draw many animals
and people who learn to extract water from them.

Particularly thick mud flats are difficult terrain, and can contain **mud sink**
squares representing deeper areas. Creatures standing adjacent to those can be
pushed into them, which will immobilize them (save ends), with a slow
after-effect due to the clinging mud (also save ends). Voluntarily or
accidentally stepping into one would have the same effect.

## Psychic Reservoirs

Fragile purple crystals that grow in psychically charged areas sheltered from
the winds, these can be tapped by psionic characters to boost their attacks. It
takes a minor action to tap into an adjacent crystal, which makes it crumble to
dust. If the character uses power points, they gain 1 bonus point that lasts
until the end of the encounter. Otherwise they gain +5 to their next damage roll
from a psionic power.

## Rocky Badlands

These regions are too rough to support permanent settlements, so they'll mostly
feature as ambush sites. They're filled with **teetering stone pillars** that
can be pushed onto enemies.

## Salt Flats

These bone-dry regions are a hassle to fight in, as salt will inevitably get in
the wounds and make them sting like hell. They're also filled with loose **salt
piles** that work a lot like the Settled Ash hazard above, except that they also
slow the target if it was bloodied.

## Sandy Wastes

What most people think of when they hear "desert". They can contain 3x3-square
**Small Dunes** that anyone might use as a hiding or ambush spot, even if they
can't normally burrow.

## Silt Pools

They work a lot like mud flats, except there's no water, just very fine
dust. Usually filled with difficult terrain, and with **deep silt spots** that
restrain (save ends) anyone who falls or gets pushed into them.

## Slipsand

Sandy areas where some magical or psionic effect caused a significant amount of
tiny glass crystals to be mixed in with the sand. They're slippery _and_ sharp,
requiring an Athletics check from any who enters them to avoid falling prone and
taking damage.

## Tree of Life

These extremely rare plants are imbued with a much greater than usual amount of
vital energy, which enables them to resist and even recover from defiling
attempts given enough time. Ironically, this makes them extremely valued by
sorcerer-kings and other powerful and rich defilers, which cultivate them for
use as batteries.

I think earlier editions kept a more or less precise list of the remaining trees
of life in Athas - they were _that_ rare. In this edition, I believe their
number is less restricted, but the most likely place you're going to find one is
still in the "boss room" for these defilers.

Trees of life emit a 5-square aura. Creatures within always regain the maximum
possible HP from variable healing effects, and have a +5 to perform divination
rituals.

Whenever someone performs Arcane Defiling inside the aura, or use some other
necrotic power that damages one of their allies, the tree takes the damage
instead. Trees have 500 HP and Vulnerable 10 Necrotic, and die when they
hit 0. They regenerate 5 HP per hour.

## Z'Tal Horde

A much funnier and more mundane piece of terrain! Z'tals are tiny, slimy, stinky
lizard-bug-things that gather in very large swarms. They're relatively harmless,
but still a bother.

A z'tall horde fills one or more squares, which are difficult terrain. Someone
who ends their movement in such a square takes 5/tier poison damage from the
stink. Someone who starts their turn in a horde square must roll a save before
taking any other actions. A failure means they fall prone because of the
slippery slime. A close or area attack that deals at least 1 point of damage
will automatically disperse a horde square with no roll required.

They're sometimes bred as living security measures, but a horde of these
annoying scavengers might naturally form around the corpse of any large
creature.
