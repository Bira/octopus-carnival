Before we launch into talking about domains, let's talk about
warpriests. "Warpriest" is the official name for the Essentials version of the
Cleric class.

Classic PHB Clerics (also known as "Templars" post-Essentials) had a set of
Strength-based melee weapon powers and another of Wisdom-based ranged implement
powers. They were generally discouraged from mixing-and-matching, and over time
the community decided that the Wisdom-based "laser cleric" build was the better
of the two, particularly when you only had the core. There were certain levels
that had no Strength powers in them, a situation that would only be remedied in
supplements.

Warpriests are another attempt at a melee cleric - all of their attack abilities
are are Wisdom-based _weapon_ powers. Warpriest Domains are the solution found
by Essential's designers to reduce the number of decisions a player must make in
order to play a cleric. Your pick one at character creation, and that determines
not only all of your level 1 powers bit also most of the encounter powers and
features you get at higher levels all the way to the end of epic tier. They're
practically ready-made builds.

Technically, some of these belong to your paragon path, but Warpriests are in
effect limited to a single choice there, which continues to provide powers from
your chosen domain. Someone who is really into character optimization might pick
a path from another source, but you can just stick to the default Devout
Warpriest path and still be pretty effective.

Heroes of the Fallen Lands, the book that introduced Warpriests, also
introduced the Sun and Storm domains. Heroes of Shadow added the Death
domain for spooky clerics, and Dragon 392 included the Earth domain.

The Neverwinter campaign setting gives us four more domains, doubling the amount
available in the game at the time of its publication. These are all dedicated to
specific FR gods, but they can be used for similar deities from this or other
settings. Though the Neverwinter campaign focuses on the heroic tier, the
domains presented here include powers for the full 30 levels of a character's
career.

I'm going to talk about each domain in very general terms, as it would take an
age to go through every power in detail. We'll cover one domain per post, and
they should each be fairly short.
