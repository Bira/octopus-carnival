The typical cyclops is a humanoid around 6 meters tall, whose wrinkled, grayish
hide resembles that of an elephant. Also like an elephant, its mouth sports a
pronounced pair of tusks. Unlike elephants, however, cyclopes are carnivorous
and quite stupid. They are commonly spotted slowly shuffling around in the
distance, sluggishly moving towards anything that smells of food. They are a
particular terror to herds of cattle, and cyclops sightings usually prompt armed
response from concerned local lords, who will usually try to drive the beasts
away rather than attempting to slay them and may resort to adventurers or pawns
if their own forces fail.

Scholars can only speculate about the life cycle of these creatures. No one has
ever seen more than two of them together, and the rare slain monster has no
reproductive organs to speak of. They probably originate from beyond the rift,
though no one knows that their native world looks like. What _is_ known from
bitter experience is that cyclopes seem to have an unexplicable fondness for
goblins and their kin. Large goblin invasion forces use them as living siege
engines, equipping them with armor made from enormous, crude iron plates.

Cyclopes like to use whole tree trunks as clubs, and they are not shy about
scooping up pesky humans at their feet and taking a bite out of them. They tend
to prefer Telegraphic Attacks, and are particularly vulnerable to attacks that
target their Will, HT or single eye.

## Other Cyclopes

### Dwarf Cyclops

This smaller variety lacks the tusks, and is "merely" four meters tall. This
means they can fit inside larger caves, and often take shelter there. Other than
being slightly smaller and less strong than its cousin, its stats are pretty
much identical.

### Gorecyclops

Found only in the deepest, most forsaken pits, the Gorecyclops is larger, faster
and smarter than your average cyclops. Over three stories tall, they
aggressively engage any who dare trespass into their territory, and attack
relentlessly and with surprising skill. They also _go berserk_ when wounded! The
fiercest of these monsters are said to be forever chained beneath the earth for
some transgression committed at the dawn of time.

The one good thing about them is that they hate goblins just as much as they
hate everyone else, so you'll never find them willingly cooperating with anyone.

### Armored Cyclops

Goblins like to encase their pet cyclopes in anything from large plates of
crudely beaten iron to a large pile of stolen pots and pans. This adds 6 DR to
all covered locations (usually the torso and legs). The most sophisticated
warbands will fashion proper helmets for their cyclopes, protecting their eyes
from attack. These add 6 DR to the face and skull, and add an extra -2 penalty
to target their eyes through the slits.

This armor is usually fashioned to make the cyclops harder to climb (see below),
giving an additional -2 penalty to such attempts.

## Giant Climbing

Cyclopes and other monsters of similar scale can't really be _grappled_ by
human-sized adventurers, but they can be _climbed_. Use unmodified **Climbing**
skill for this, as the the folds of a cyclops' skin are easy to grab hold
of. The monster resists with its DX or best grappling skill as it tries to pry
the adventurer from itself. It's not a matter of strength for the cyclops, but
of reaching the pest. The monster's skill may be penalized if the adventurer is
in a particularly difficult spot.

A PC who manages to get to a vulnerable spot in the monster's body can attack it
at no hit-location penalty using a one-handed weapon. A cyclops who manages to
reach the offending character and pry them loose is now holding a convenient
morsel in its hand, and will usually attempt to take a bite.
