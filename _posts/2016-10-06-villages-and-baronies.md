## Introduction

Now that we have an overview of what Gransys and its settlements look like,
let's take a more detailed look at a few specific locations in it, starting with
its settlements. Rather than providing an exhaustive list, I'll describe a few
representative examples using **GURPS City Stats** rules. These will include the
two settlements we get in the original game, but also other made-up
examples. We'll go by the order in which these communities are discussed in
**GURPS Fantasy**, from smaller to largest. This first article covers villages
and baronies, but it starts with a note on isolated homesteads.

## Isolates

Gransys is a dangerous place at the best of times, never mind during a draconic
incursion. With all the bandits and wandering monsters prowling around, an
isolated homestead has about the same life expectancy as a snowball in an
oven. Some people still try, though. We find some of these in the original game:
every single one is an abandoned shell that is at best deserted, and at worst
home to the monsters or bandits who emptied it.

## Villages

This is the minimum viable settlement size in this dangerous land. Villages in
Gransys tend to house 200-300 people, living in wooden houses with thatched
roofs. These houses are made so they can be torn down and rebuilt relatively
easily in response to environmental changes or to move closer to
newly-productive land.

Villages have a small chapel of the Faith built out of stone, manned by a single
priest. The chapel's grounds also contain the village's graveyard. Villages not
located near a river or stream will have a well.

The vast majority of villagers are farmers, cultivating the land in a roughly 1
mile (1.6km) radius around the village itself. Few villagers travel much beyond
this radius, and even fewer go out further than the manor of their local
lord. Some will be artisans such as blacksmiths and tinkers who are capable of
supplying the village's everyday needs. Smaller villages might lack even these,
relying on traveling peddlers who make a regular circuit between a set of
villages.

Baronies control about three adjacent villages, with the baron's manor located
in one of them. Between servants, guards and the baron's family, manor houses
contain about 50-60 people. Manorial villages also host markets are irregular
intervals, which draw inhabitants from neighboring settlements. Tribute
collectors go forth from the manor once a year to make a circuit of the barony's
villages. Part of this tribute is sent on to Gran Soren, and part goes to
support the barony itself.

### Placing Villages

The in-game map of Gransys doesn't leave much room for villages or manors, but
as we already saw it's compressed by a factor of 10 or so. Using the distances
we figured out earlier leaves plenty of space for these new settlements. Most of
them will occupy the "plains" on the map - stretches of relatively flat and open
terrain. Some will be near forests and occupy themselves with logging and
hunting - the latter especially on the north, which would bring in furs for
trade.

### Example: Grandvine Barony

Individual villages, especially if they're peaceful, are rarely interesting
locations to visit. So I cheated a bit for the example and statted up a
three-village _barony_ using **GURPS City Stats**. It's a little outside the
intended scope of the rules, but the numbers involved are small enough that they
still work out. I've also omitted the **Language** entry from the stats, as
we're not working with multiple languages in this particular adaptation.

Grandvine Barony got this name due to the high quality of its manor's vineyard,
but that was a long time ago. Located a few kilometers west of the ruins of
Aernst Castle, the barony has been hit especially hard by the bandits who made
the castle their base a few years ago. These ruffians took control of the trail
linking South and Central Gransys, and regularly attack tribute and trade
caravans going through it. They also sometimes raid the barony's two outlying
villages.

Baron Alecto has a handful of trained soldiers at his disposal, but they are not
numerous enough to face the bandits directly. Combining them with a peasant
militia _might_ work, but either way it would lead to losses he considers
unaceptable. Ser Alexa, his daughter and only heir, is much more
impetuous. Having just completed her knightly training, she wishes to rally the
neighbouring lords, raise the militia, and mount an assault on the ruined
castle. Standing on her way are her father's concerns and the fact that the
neighbouring lords are much less personally affected by the bandit problem,
being further away from them and not that interested in sending tribute to the
Duke in the first place.
