## The Lore

Described as "small, squat, and pugnacious", these round boys are reptilian dog
equivalents with keen senses and a vicious streak. On the wild they follow your
standard pack hunter structure, but they're also frequently "tamed" by people
for use as combat, guard, and tracker animals.

"Tamed" is in quotes here because jhakars don't form bonds of loyalty with their
handlers. They respect strength and pain, but they also nurse grudges. So the
process of training a jhakar is quite cruel and results in a creature that's
likely to turn on their handler as soon as it sees a chance. Ironically, because
of this owning a trained jhakar is seen as a sign of strength.

## The Numbers

Jhakars are Small Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag. They have a ground speed
of 6 and Low-Light Vision. Their signature ability is **Uncanny Senses**, which
makes their attacks ignore concealment.

Jhakars don't have supernatural tracking abilities like some of the monsters we
saw before, but you can probably consider them as good at it as a trained
mundane hound.

### Jhakar Tracker

This specimen is a Level 1 Skirmisher with 28 HP and all standard jhakar
traits. As mentioned above, it's probably as good at tracking as a mundane dog,
but its stat block focuses more on what it does once it finds its prey.

The tracker's **bite** does standard damage with a sizable bonus against targets
granting combat advantage to it. The attack also lets the tracker shift 1 square
as an effect.

Once per encounter the tracker can use an **Opportunistic Chomp** as a reaction
when an enemy ends its turn within 2 squares. It lets make a free bite attack
with the damage bonus.

Trackers are unlikely to stay in one place for very long. Their free shift with
a bite lets them move in, bite, and then dart away.

### Jhakar Trapjaw

This beefier specimen is a Level 3 Soldier with 47 HP. Its **Bite** is a bit
stronger, grabs on a hit, and lets the trapjaw make a secondary attack against
Fortitude. If that one hits, the grabbed victim takes 5 ongoing damage until
the grab ends.

The trapjaw can also **Drag Down** a grabbed victim, attacking their
Fortitude. If they hit, they deal heavy damage and knock the target prone. It
can't get up until the grab ends either! This recharges when the creature is
first bloodied.

Unlike trackers, jhakar trapjaws are set up to choose a PC and make their day
extremely bad. They'll do exactly that, positioning themselves as the center of
attention to let their quicker buddies attack the party while they're
distracted. This works no matter who those allies are, so it's appropriate for
both wild and domesticated jhakar.

## Encounters and Final Impressions

This entry is short and to the point, just like the creatures it
describes. You'll never ever need to include normal dogs or wolves in our Dark
Sun Campaigns if this book has anything to say about it.

An encounter group of wild Jhakars will probably include one or two trapjaws
with trackers making up the rest of the numbers. And of course any of the other
doglike creatures in this or other books could be reskinned as a jhakar. They
also work in any mixed encounter as trained beasts, as they are fairly common in
that role.
