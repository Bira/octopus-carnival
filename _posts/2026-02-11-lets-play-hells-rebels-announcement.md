As I mentioned in a [post back in December][1], I've been actually playing this
solo game in a sporadic fashion for years. And as I said back when I started, I
planned to post it here. So why didn't I?

Basically, it was anxiety over art.

The first thing I was going to do was to post the stats for my player
characters, and since these were going to be "proper blog posts", I decided I
wanted to have illustrations for them just like I have for all the other
characters I posted before.

My method of procuring them was going to be the same. I'd use search indexes and
trawl some specific art sites for published images I could add to the post, with
proper credit and a link to the original.

For certain characters, that's dead easy. But for a couple of others I ended up
never finding an image that _exactly_ matched what I wanted. Or when I did find
one that had the right vibe, it turned out the artist explicitly forbade this
kind of usage, even with proper credit. Also one of my sources was Pinterest and
I had just learned that one site had a serious "proper credit" issue. Whoops!
What to do?

I know exactly what suggestion is already forming in a lot of your brains right
now, and I'm gonna stop y'all right there and say "no". I'm not using AI for
this, or anything else. Not now, not ever.

So after way too long you'll get those posts without illustrations at all. I
can't draw, but I can write, so you're getting verbal descriptions. And maybe
then I can finally proceed with publishing this.
