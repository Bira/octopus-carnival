Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder's Iconic Characters to
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**! This is the third post in the series. Previous
entries can be found here:

- [Amiri the Barbarian][4]
- [Lem the Bard][5]

Today's template is the Cleric, which means today's
star is Kyra. Here she is:

You can find her full bio [here][1], and her original Pathfinder
stats [here][2]. From looking at them we can see the following:

* Kyra is from Qadira, her world's Persia/Arabia equivalent. She's the sole
  survivor from a bandit raid on her farming village.

* Kyra is a cleric of [Sarenrae][3], the goddess of healing, redemption,
  honesty, and the sun. She teaches her devotees to always seek to redeem those
  who follow the path of evil, and to destroy them if that proves impossible.

* She wields a scimitar, her deity's favored weapon. Her cleric spells generally
  have a "light, fire and healing" theme, and she possesses the typical D&D
  cleric ability to turn undead.

Given Sarenrae's portfolio, we could represent Kyra with the just the base
Cleric template from **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 1: Adventurers**... but the Sun
Priest lens from **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 7: Clerics** fits her better, so
let's use that!

Once again we managed to hit all the major points of the original character. Her
mandatory disadvantage is the Vow, which about as inconvenient as Pacifism
(Cannot Harm Innocents) and is priced accordingly. Kyra spends one point in
extra starting cash in order to afford the scimitar (which has the same stats as
a thrusting broadsword). Instead of a sling she uses a bow, because that's how
sun clerics roll in Dungeon Fantasy.
