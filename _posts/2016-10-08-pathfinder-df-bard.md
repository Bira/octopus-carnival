Another weekend, another iconic character converted to GURPS Dungeon Fantasy!
The next template in **DF1** is the Bard, which means that
after [Amiri the Barbarian][amiri] our next subject is Lem the Bard. Here he is:

You can find his full bio [here][lem-bio], and his original Pathfinder stats can
be found [here][lem-stats]. From looking at them we can see the following:

* Lem was born a slave in the devil-worshipping nation of Cheliax. He escaped in
  a rather fiery fashion.

* He hates slavery and slavers, and tends to side with the underdog in most
  conflicts.

* Lem has a sling and a shortsword, both sized for a halfling, but prefers to
  use his magic in a fight. He mostly uses his bard song to bolster his allies,
  and targets particularly tough foes with hindering spells to make them easier
  to take down.

Given the information above, I feel we need to dip into two other DF books to
properly portray him. As Lem is a halfling, I'll need the racial template from
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level**. And since the d20 Bard Song power
is core to his tactics, we'll need its equivalent from **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
11: Power-Ups**.

As before, the end result hits pretty much all of the same points as the
Pathfinder version. Lem's weapons don't do a lot of damage, so he's a lot better
off relying on Bard-Song and spells. And while his spells aren't exactly the
same as those of a Pathfinder bard, they still follow the "mostly hinder enemies
with a side of helping allies" motif. Good places to spend XP on would be more
spells and alternate song abilities.
