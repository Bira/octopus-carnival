This post belongs to a series converting Dragon's Dogma enemies to
**GURPS**. All other entries, and all other posts adapting the setting can be
found [here][1].

Gargoyles in Dragon's Dogma are pretty much what you'd expect from hearing the
word: humanoid flying monsters with rock-hard skin and a love of clawing out the
eyes of unwary adventurers. The gargoyles of Gransys are living creatures, with
flesh and blood beneath that rock skin, so they add "hunting for food" to their
list of usual reasons for attacking PCs (territoriality, plain cruelty,
etc.). They also have an additional surprise in store: their tails are tipped by
a stinger capable of injecting a petrifying poison into a victim. They can't eat
the resulting statue, but it's still a good tactic for finishing off foes who
put up more of a fight than anticipated.

Gargoyles dislike sunlight, and so make their homes in ruins and cave complexes,
particularly those that feature one or more tall chambers full of good nesting
spots. Someone suddenly attacked by a gargoyle in one of these dark places might
confuse them with a harpy at first, only to be surprised at how little effect
their blows have on the creature. Somehow bypassing a gargoyle's DR is vital to
effectively fighting it.
