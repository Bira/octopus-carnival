I can't find spriggans in my 2nd edition and earlier books, but I know they're
in Pathfinder, so they were probably introduced in D&D 3.x. This entry is their
4e debut. It feels like there's been some condensing here because this entry
also uses several other names that I'm sure belonged to separate "small evil
fey" enemies, like "redcap" and "powrie".

## The Lore

Back in the [post on gnomes][2], we already saw that the gnome people used to be
enslaved by the fomorians in the ancient past, but that they managed to
escape. Here, we learn that not all of them managed to get away. Those
unfortunates were eventually twisted into spriggans by fomorian magic. It's
unclear whether this happened as punishment for the escape attempt, or during
some subsequent experiment.

The book doesn't describe present-day spriggans as fomorian slaves, so maybe
they were discarded by their former masters as failures. They live in
underground settlements excavated under rugged terrain.

Fomorian magic warped spriggan hearts as much as it did their bodies. Soaking
stuff in the blood of enemies seems to be a big deal to them. Their habit of
doing that to their hats caused them to also be known as redcaps by other
sapients. Spriggan communities delight in raiding, tormenting and extracting
tribute from their weaker neighbors, behaving pretty much like bandit gangs.

## The Numbers

Spriggans are Small Fey Humanoids with low-light vision and a ground speed
of 6. Their signature ability is **Redcap Zeal**, a free-action encounter power
that grants them temporary HP when they bloody or defeat an enemy.

### Spriggan Giantsoul

Giantsouls tap into the fomorian magic in their blood, which gives them enhanced
strength and the ability to stretch their arms to gain a giant's reach. They're
Level 8 Brutes with 106 HP.

These spriggans fight unarmed, using **slams** as their basic attack. The
stretch-arm thing comes into play in the **Giantsoul Slam** special attack
(recharge 4+), which is Reach 2, does the same damage as the slam, and knocks
prone on a hit. Both attacks deal bonus damage when the spriggan is bloodied.

Once per encounter, the giantsoul can use a **Surprise Slam**, an interrupt that
triggers when an enemy within 2 squares of them attacks an ally. This allows it
to use Giantsoul Slam against the triggering enemy, recharging the ability if
necessary.

They're good frontliners, with a limited ability to protect squishier allies
when the PCs try to get around them.

### Spriggan Powrie

All spriggans use iron-shod boots as part of their combat gear, but powries have
a particular dedication to the fine art of stomping. They're Level 7 Skirmishers
with 79 HP.

The powrie fights with a **sickle** that does light physical damage and inflicts
ongoing damage. It can also be used in a **Hamstring** special attack that has
the same effects and also knocks prone and slows for a turn. This recharges when
the powrie is first bloodied.

Against prone enemies it can use the amusing **Punt The Fallen** attack, which
deals the same damage as the sickle and pushes 3 squares. The best thing about
this attack is that it's an at-will minor action!

If the powrie has combat advantage against a creature taking ongoing damage,
attacking that creature with any of the above will also increase their ongoing
damage by 5.

Finally, the **Blood Slide** passive trait prevents the powrie from provoking
opportunity attacks when leaving a square adjacent to a creature who's bloodied
or taking ongoing damage.

So most of the time a powrie will be attacking enemies with the sickle and
moving around the battlefield with the aid of Blood Slide in order to spread as
much ongoing damage around as possible, and will then seek combat advantgae
against a single target. Hamstring and Punt the Fallen is an hilarious
combination, and the latter means powries pair really well with other enemies
who can drop targets prone more often. Multiple powries in a fight mean you can
begin an impromptu soccer match with a prone PC as the ball.

### Spriggan Thorn

The spriggan thorn is armed with a short sword and a light shield, which are
imbued with a curse of thorns. The sword itself is enveloped in them, and the
spriggan can curse an enemy and cause thorns to spring from under their
skin. It's a Level 6 Soldier with 71 HP.

The **Short Sword** damages and inflicts ongoing damage (thorns!). It can be
enhanced with the **Drowsing Puncture** power as a minor action. This makes the
next attack daze the target for a turn and knock them prone, if it hits. It
recharges when the thorn is first bloodied.

The curse is called **Mark of Thorns**, and it's an encounter power that
automatically hits a target in a Close Burst 5. A cursed target can't make
opportunity attacks against the thorn, and takes 4 damage at the end of any turn
in which it didn't attack the thorn. Any allies of the target that start the
turn adjacent to them also take 4 damage.

Drowsing Puncture is a fine skill to use against PC defenders, and the Mark is
quite versatile. When used against a defender, it allows the thorn to slip past
the PC front-line unmolested. It also works to diver the attention of any PC who
would normally gain more by attacking one of the spriggan's more fragile
allies. They pair really well with powries, who can end up increasing the
ongoing damage caused by the swords.

### Spriggan Witherer

Witherers are spriggan spellcasters who specialize in harmful weather control
magic. They can probably cause serious trouble to agrarian communities with
rituals, and they can also create more localized effects useful in
combat. They have an obsession with soaking the earth in blood, so they pair
well with enemies with a similar imagery. They're Level 8 Artillery with 70 HP
and the Leader keyword.

Their melee attack is a **whithering touch** vs. Reflex that deals necrotic
damage. Their main single-target ranged attack is **Sun Scorch** (Ranged 10
vs. Reflex) dealing fire and radiant damage. They can use a spell named
**Flattening Wind** either as a close blast 3 or as an area 3/range 10 attack
vs. Fortitude. This deals physical damage, pushes 2 squares, and knocks
prone. It recharges when they're first bloodied.

After they're bloodied, they can use **Blood For the Earth** at will. This is an
area 2/range 10 attack that deals light physical damage, inflicts ongoing
damage, and gives 5 temporary HP to any allies caught in the area.

This makes for an artillery threat that starts off fairly aggressive and
switches to more of a support role as the fight proceeds.

## Sample Encounters and Final Impressions

Spriggans are fairly good at fulfilling the "small evil fey" niche, and I love
the ties to fomorian lore. There are some good synergies between the stat blocks
presented here,

Spriggans can still be found working for fomorians, but some also work for evil
eladrin or run their own rackets. They keep dangerous plants and animals around
their settlements for protection.

The sample encounter is level 9: an evil eladrin twilight incanter with a pet
shambling mound and a quartet of spriggan goons (2 giantsouls, 2 witherers).
