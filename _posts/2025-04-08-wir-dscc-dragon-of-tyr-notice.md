At this point in our [read-through of the Dark Sun Creature Catalog][1], it the
next entry in the book would be the Dragon of Tyr. As I mentioned in the
[corresponding RPG.net thread][2], however, the Dragon's touches upon the
setting's deepest secrets. These only appear at the very end of the Dark Sun
Campaign Setting book, which forum user zedturtle is reading in another
thread. I don't want to spoil him ahead of time.

The other reason for this is that the Dragon of Tyr is a singular character and
a very important one in the setting, so he should really be over on the
Personages section of the book.

For both of these reasons, I'm discussing the Dragon at the end of this Let's
Read.
