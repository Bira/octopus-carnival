Today's template is the Thief, which means today's character is Merisiel. Here
she is:

Merisiel has all the knives. _All of them_. We're back in familiar territory
with her, as she's one of the Iconics from the core book. Her bio is [here][10]
and her stats are [here][11]. From these, we can learn the following:

- Merisiel is one of the Forlorn, an elf raised among humans. They get this
  depressing name because Pathfinder elves are of the type that takes nearly a
  century to grow up. She spent these decades as a street urchin who stowed away
  on ships bound for different cities when her current buddies outgrew her.

- She's not the sharpest knife in the drawer but makes up for that by carrying a
  lot of really sharp knives on her person. She tries to start every combat
  hidden, to better backstab her foes.

- Merisiel has an open and expressive personality, always tries to have fun in
  the moment, and is always chasing the next get-rich-quick scheme.

Despite being pretty much a bog-standard d20/Pathfinder character, Merisiel
presents us with several interesting challenges when it comes to adapting her to
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**.

First of all, she's an elf, but _which type_ of elf?  There's like a hundred of
them in **Dungeon Fantasy 3**. Pathfinder's stats for elves would suggest the
High Elf racial template is appropriate. That's not all, however! Merisiel is a
_Forlorn_ elf, which means she grew up among humans and had no contact with
elven culture to speak of. And the **DF 3** elf template that best models that
is the _Half_-Elf, even down to the problems relating to both humans and
elves. Theoretically full-blooded elves would have longer lifespans and such,
but that's not worth any points in a **DF** campaign.

The other challenge is finding the appropriate template for her. The Thief
template from **DF 1** is a lot closer to the Thief class from early D&D - a
middling combatant who's great at stealth, trap-finding, and reaching difficult
places. The d20 Rogue class is still good at those non-combat things, but its
main focus is stabbing monsters for massive damage. This is why Merisiel's
Pathfinder stats give her a rapier despite her bio's focus on knives - it's the
best melee weapon for rogues in that system. I'm going to use the Thief template
here, since it's the whole point of this post, but I don't want to leave the
stabbing part entirely out. Fortunately, the list of Thief Power-Ups in **DF
11** gives us something to remedy that.

Our version of Merisiel is quite sharper than her original bio indicates, though
I suppose it wouldn't be apparent to someone who witnessed her failing two or
more simultaneous self-control rolls. Both her DX and IQ are one point lower
than you would expect for someone with these templates, to make room for the
stabby (Weapon Master for all sorts of knives and Backstabber). The reduced IQ
hurts some of her thief skills, but we make up for that with an extra level of
Manual Dexterity (which also affects DX-based rolls for Traps and Lockpicking).

Some future upgrades that look particularly appropriate are more levels of
Backstabber and Night Vision. As a member of one **DF**'s "skill monkey"
templates, she can also benefit from increases to all of her skills,
particularly Main-Gauche (which is a bit low for a weapon master) and the mental
skills hurt by the IQ reduction. Actually buying that "lost" point of IQ would
be a worthwhile investment, as would the Thief-specific Talents from **DF 11**.
