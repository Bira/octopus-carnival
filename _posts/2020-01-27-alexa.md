Years ago, Alexa's father (a minor baron) sent her to the capital to serve as
squire to a somewhat eccentric knight. She returns to her home a knight in her
own right, skilled with sword and spell, to find her ancestral lands at the edge
of ruin. Against the wishes of her ailing father, Alexa sets forth to bring
honor, glory, and wealth back to her family name.

Alexa is made using the spell-based [Mystic Knight template from this blog][1],
rather than the Imbuement-based official one. Her Weirdness Magnet is a perfect
explanation for why the Odds and Sods party got together in the first place,
making her their unnoficial leader.
