The Spawn of Kyuss were introduced in the Age of Worms adventure path,
originally published in Dungeon Magazine in 2005-2006, when it was run by
Paizo. Some of Kyuss' most powerful servants were reprinted in the Elder Evils
supplement for 3.5e, and later got conversion stats in an early 4th edition web
enhancement file. This means this is technically not the Spawn's 4e debut, but
it is the first time we get complete lore and lower-than-epic stats for them.

## The Lore

In ancient times, Kyuss was a mortal magician and a charismatic cult leader, who
led his followers to a remote jungle region in order to establish a base. There,
he found ruins from an even more ancient pre-human civilization. With the
knowledge he learned from those ruins, the cultist sacrificed his followers in a
ritual to become a giant undead demigod whose body was made out of bright green
worms. The Worm that Walks spent a long time imprisoned outside the world, but
the prophecy of the Age of Worms foretells that he will return and devour the
world in what is basically a worm-fueled zombie apocalypse.

The Spawn of Kyuss are undead created by infecting corpses with worms plucked
from his own body. They're easily distinguished by the wriggling mass of green
worms crawling all over them, inside and outside. They're Kyuss' agents in the
world and their presence presages his return. Even if the Worm's return is not
imminent, these creatures might still be found performing some task that
furthers their patron's interests, whether by themselves or allied with
cultists.

The first Spawn were Kyuss' original followers, sacrificed in that first
ritual. Making new ones is a matter of performing a simple worm transplant from
a spawn to an available body, living or dead. The ones listed here are not
particularly smart, but it's worth remembering that [Larva Mages][2] are also
the spawn of Kyuss.

## The Numbers

We get three varieties of Spawn here, all suitable as threats to Paragon-tier
parties. They're Medium Natural Animates with a Speed of 5 and Darkvision, plus
the usual undead traits: immunity to disease and poison, a resistance to
necrotic damage, and a vulnerability to radiant damage. They're also vulnerable
to fire - it burns the worms right up.

All of the spawn here can also transmit the Touch of Kyuss, which is basically
an infestation of evil supernatural worms. It's treated as a Level 16 disease
resisted with Endurance (DC 25 to improve or 20 to maintain). Stage 1 makes the
victim regain only half hit points from spending healing surges, and causes them
to rise as wretches of Kyuss if they die. Stage 2 causes them to lose 2 healing
surges, and if they ever reach 0 surges they die and rise as Sons of
Kyuss. Stage 3 cuts to the chase and kills the victim right away so it can rise
as a Son.

### Son of Kyuss

These things look like zombies at a first glance, but they're sapient and much
stronger. Their goal is to usually spread the "blessing" of Kyuss to as many
living people as they can. Though they're not exactly geniuses at Int 6, they
can and will coordinate in order to accomplish it.

Sons of Kyuss are Level 13 Brutes with 158 HP. They project a **Fear of Worms**
aura which inflicts a -2 attack penalty to living creatures inside. Their basic
attack is a **Slam** that damages and exposes the target to the Touch of
Kyuss. It can also "shoot" **Burrowing Worms** in a Close Burst 1 (recharge
5+). A hit inflicts 10 ongoing damage, increasing to 15 on the first failed save
and to 20 plus stun on the second. If someone dies from this they immediately
rise as a wretch of Kyuss (see below). The wretch must be destroyed before the
victim can be raised.

### Wretch of Kyuss

An undead creature with a lower worm content than a full Son of Kyuss. It's less
sturdy but still quite dangerous and quite contagious, being a Level 13 Minion
Brute. Its **Slam** deals light necrotic damage, and when it dies it bursts,
inflicting necrotic damage in a Close Burst 1 and exposing anyone hit by this
attack to the Touch of Kyuss.

### Herald of Kyuss

These undead abomination were created from the bodies of angels sent by the gods
to stop the Worm that Walks. They're Medium Immortal Animates (undead), and have
all the same traits as the other spawn. Also, they can fly at speed 6.

The Herald is a Level 16 Artillery monster with 116 HP. They have the same Fear
of Worms aura as the Son, plus a **Writhing Host** aura of the same size that
deals 10 necrotic damage to enemies caught inside. All of their attacks expose
the target to the Touch of Kyuss on a hit, making them the most contagious spawn
of all.

Their basic melee attack is a **Rotting Caress** that deals necrotic
damage. They can attack at range by making **Writhing Pronouncements** that deal
immediate and ongoing 5 necrotic damage. This worsens to 10 and a daze on the
first failed save, and to 15 and a stun on the second (save ends). People killed
by this turn into wretches of Kyuss, which must be destroyed before the victims
can be raised.

Once per encounter they can call an **Eruption of Maggots** that acts as a
disgusting fireball-sized area attack. It deals immediate and ongoing necrotic
damage, and also creates a damaging zone that lasts for the rest of the
encounter.

## Final Impressions

Ewwww. Kill these with fire as soon as possible. If your GM is re-enacting the
Age of Worms campaign, you can expect to run into these things very often. Their
main gimmick is all about infecting people with the Touch of Kyuss, so PCs can
expect to stop and cast Remove Affliction more or less after every fight unless
they're under extreme time pressure. Stage 1 is already a major debuff, and
staying at Stage 2 is a serious gamble.
