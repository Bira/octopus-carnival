Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder's Iconic Characters to
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy!** This is the fifth post in the series. Previous
entries can be found here:

- [Amiri the Barbarian][1]
- [Lem the Bard][2]
- [Kyra the Cleric][3]
- [Lini the Druid][4]

Today's template is the Holy Warrior, which means that today's character is
Seelah. Here she is:

Cool, huh? She's my second favorite design so far, losing only to Kyra (Lini is
a close third). Her [bio][5], however, is by far the best. It's quite tragic,
but seems to hit a good balance between "biblical" and "Arthurian". Her official
stats are [here][6]. From these we can learn the following:

- Seelah is a paladin of Iomedae the Inheritor, a Lawful Good deity of justice
  and protection. She wears heavy armor and fights with sword and shield, with a
  bow kept in reserve.

- She has the usual varied suite of paladin powers, the ones most emphasized are
  her fearlessness, her ability to smite evil, and her healing hands, in that
  order.

- While Seelah goes after all manner of evil foes, she fights fiends and evil
  dragons with particular fervor.

Given Iomedae's description as the goddess of justice and valor, the default
Holy Warrior package should suit her just fine. The end result doesn't quite
have the points to afford all the standard paladin abilities - healing is
expensive! However, the GURPS version of Seelah is absolutely fearless,
supernaturally resistant to disease, can channel divine might to enhance her
strength, and is particularly adept at fighting demons. All that as a starting
DF character! Buying the Faith Healing ability with earned character points
should be next on her list.
