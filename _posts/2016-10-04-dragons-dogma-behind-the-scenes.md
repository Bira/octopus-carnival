In this Dragon's Dogma adaptation, I've been mostly working from my impressions
of the game itself so far. Recently, though I've come accross a video
of [this talk][talk-link] by the game's creator Hideaki Itsuno that sheds some
light into the thought processes behind its gameplay. It does contain some
spoilers, so beware!

The [Dragon's Dogma Wikia][wikia] site also has some setting information that's
very interesting to me, and even more spoilery than the video. I'll be using
that as appropriate.

One interesting tidbit from these two sources is that in-game Gransys is
supposed to be around 3 miles across. So, if my experiment from the previous
post is correct, then the in-game map is compressed by a factor of 10. I've
always wondered about that.
