Doug Cole of Gaming Ballistic is at it again with a Kickstarter campaign for
[The Citadel at Nordvorn][1], a mini-setting for the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying
Game and GURPS Dungeon Fantasy. For [reasons of my own][2] I won't be
contributing to this one myself, but I will definitely buy it once it's out.

So please go ahead and back this thing so that I can eventually buy it :)!
