## The Lore

Mearedes is a goliath druid, the self-appointed Sentinel of Shault. Shault, in
turn, is a hidden island paradise in the Sea of Silt, one of the greenest areas
remaining in the Tyr Region, largely thanks to the efforts of Mearedes and her
disciples.

Those disciples are the giants Shakka and Shola, and the dwarf Hippolexes. They,
their master, and a few volunteers from the local stone and beast giant
communities intercept any strangers making landfall on Shault, and demand they
subject themselves to a ritual that prevents them from ever speaking about the
island to others. Those who refuse are killed. As you might imagine, very few
people ever return from Shault, and those who do aren't saying anything about
it.

Though Mearedes has an age-lined face, she's still as spry as a young goliath,
and has received the respectful title of "Little Grandmother" from the local
giants. Those who help her and her friends fight off threats to Shault will find
her to be a stalwart ally.

## The Numbers

Mearedes, as mentioned, is a Goliath. She's also a Level 18 Controller with 176
HP, Speed 6, and a lot of Classic Druid Powers, which might look very exotic to
typical Athasian characters.

She fights in melee with a **Thorny Staff** that damages and slows for a turn;
and at range with **Flame Seeds** that deal fire damage, and inflict 5 fire
damage on any enemy that enters one of the squares adjacent to the target or
starts their turn there before the end of her next turn. This means _the target_
can take this additional damage if they try to move.

And then there's the expected **Lashing Vines** (recharge 6+), a fireball-sized
area attack that damages and then creates a zone of hazardous difficult terrain
that lasts for the rest of the encounter. It damages and slows those caught
inside. Yes, this is a recharge power, so the battlemap will become rougher and
rougher as time goes on.

As a minor action, Mearedes can assume the **Form of the Ghost Panther** for a
turn and shift 3 squares. In this form, she cannot attack but gains +4 Speed,
insubstantial, and phasing. She can end this as a free action or sustain it for
another turn as a minor action. And she also has the Goliath **Stone's
Endurance** encounter power, which lets her gain Resistance 10 to all damage for
a turn.

## Encounters and Final Impressions

Mearedes will almost always be accompanied by her three apprentices (whose stats
are left as an exercise for the reader) and by as many stone and beast giants
you need to make the fight interesting. She's also clearly meant to be more of
an ally than an enemy here, so she or some of her apprentices could also tag
along with the group for a short while.
