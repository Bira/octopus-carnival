Despite being smaller than cyclopes, ogres are actually more dangerous! A
cyclops is a slow, stupid, and indecisive combatant that may be driven away by
an insistent enough attack. None of that applies to ogres! While not really
_bright_, they are very cunning and driven to satisfy their endless
hunger. Ogres tend to live in caves and ruins, and their smaller size means they
don't require those ruins to be exceptionally spacious. They love to eat fresh
meat, especially that of humans, and will attack any they perceive. While
typically solitary, sometimes people do run into a pair of them.

In combat, ogres will make use of their great strength to strike enemies, but
what they really like to do is grab a foe and _twist_. Faced with a large group,
they will often grab a single for and try to drag them away, but it doesn't take
much to make an ogre go berserk. A berserk ogre fights to the death, but even
then it has enough presence of mind to fight smart, targetting its
weaker-looking foes and trying to get the others in a position where they can't
dodge effectively.

Ogres don't typically carry weapons, but will gladly use any available objects
as improvised clubs or projectiles.

## Variants

_Elder Ogres_: Legend has it that ogres grow stronger and tougher as they age,
and that they are either immortal or extremely long-lived. Such an Elder Ogre
would add extra ST, DR and combat skill on top of the stat block above depending
on its age.
