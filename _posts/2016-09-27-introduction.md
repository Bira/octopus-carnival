Welcome to the Octopus Carnival! This blog serves two purposes: hosting my
English language RPG-related writing, and allowing me to learn how to use the
Jekyll site generation engine.

Why Jekyll? Because Tumblr has been getting on my nerves lately. I have a
Portuguese language personal blog in there, and while I was never assiduous in
maintaining it recent changes in the Tumblr user interface have made me even
less inclined to do so.

And why English? I'm not a native speaker, but pretty much anything RPG-related
I've done in the past handful of years, from reading books to preparing material
to playing the games, has been done in that language. It's slightly easier for
me to think about games in English at this point. Plus, I want to be featured in
the [GURPS Day summaries][gurps-day] over at Gaming Ballistic!

One of the biggest inspirations for this was the excellent and extensive
[Psi Wars][psi-wars] series of articles on Mailanka's blog, which aims to create
a Star Wars-like setting from the ground up. Adapting stuff from media to role
playing games has always been something I've been very interested in, and this
finally pushed me to try it publically.

As a first project, I intend to adapt some stuff from the Dragon's Dogma video
game. I _think_ it will be relatively easy to do, and a smaller task than Psi
Wars, but time will see if I'm wrong. In addition to that, I'll post other stuff
as it comes to me, like one-off characters or rules.
