I've recently published a three-post miniseries adapting the [humans][1],
[elves][2], and [other interesting folks][3] from the Elder Scrolls series of
computer games to GURPS. Now I want to talk a bit about how I did it!

These three posts, and the [One-Post Skyrim][5] adaptation that preceded them,
were the first time in a while where I was able to fully exercise the approach
to adapting video games that I outlined as one of the [very first articles on
this blog][4]. And the mini-series in particular was where I tried some new
things, and I feel it's worth talking about these things.

## Researching the Source Material

Everything I said way back when in [Adapting Videogames][4] still reflects the
way I think about this process. Fiction takes precedence over original
mechanics, and I get to pick and choose from both in case they contradict
themselves.

For One-Post Skyrim I had just the one game to look at, but for Peoples of
Tamriel I needed to cast a wider net. Elder Scrolls is a sprawling,
decade-spanning franchise, where these contradictions are bound to come up a lot
more often. So how did I deal with it?

My "original sources" here were all the _mainline_ games of the Elder Scrolls
franchise, as described by the [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages][6]
wiki[^1]. That's still a huge amount of data, and it's positively filled with
all those contradictions I mentioned above.

Most of them are mechanics-based. Basically, each game in the series differs as
much from its predecessor as, say, D&D 3.0 is from AD&D, _at a minimum_. I
decided to narrow the field down a little by looking at what changed and what
remained constant between games. Things that changed every game were obviously
less important to replicating its "feel" than things that stayed the same.

The big invariant here is the core gameplay loop: in every game, you wander and
explore the world. You are given quests by NPCs, or discover them through other
means. You enter dungeons, fight the enemies inside, and loot their
treasure. There is a "main quest", but you can choose to ignore it in favor of
faffing about doing sidequests or simply raiding dungeons as you come across
them.

You might remember I wrote pretty much the exact same thing during One-Post
Skyrim. That's because these things remain as true in Skyrim as they were in
Arena[^2]. All of it is very "high level" stuff, and does not require any
specific tabletop mechanics to replicate, which is awesome for me. But how about
the specific mechanical details? When it comes to playable character origins,
the list of invariants is surprisingly small: you can choose from
several. That's it! The exact composition of the list and what each origin's
traits are changes significantly from game to game.

## Adapting the Peoples of Tamriel

In the end I opted to use the list from Skyrim, which is both the most complete
and the most popular of the franchise (it's also used by Oblivion and
Online). And when statting them up, I did two things: I avoided using the word
"race" as much as possible, and I didn't give them any attribute adjustments or
mandatory mental disadvantages. This has the benefit of making these templates
feel very "Skyrim"-like, since that's also the way Skyrim does things. But there
were other reasons why I chose this approach.

There's an article out there that says it much better than I can, but
unfortunately I've lost the link to it. Basically, the way racial attribute
adjustment works in systems like D&D reinforces character stereotypes in a way
that could be considered racist if it was applied to real-world people. Calling
these bits of character creation _races_ doesn't help either, since that word
has a lot of baggage from the real world.

GURPS Dungeon Fantasy doesn't suffer from this to the same extent with attribute
adjustments, since the cost of a racial template is small compared to the
player's total point budget. It does however, kinda fall prey to it when it
comes to racial advantages and disadvantages. The bigot who says "all cat-folk
are lazy spazzes", or "all dwarves are hard-headed greedy bastards" ends up
kinda having a point when those traits are a mandatory part of their templates.

I didn't really want to play in a setting where bigots have a point, even about
entirely fictional populations. I'm pretty satisfied with the final result: all
the templates felt flavorful, and their traits didn't force players to pick a
particular profession over another as much. Players who want to hew closer to
the cultural stereotypes about a given people could pick from the list of
optional "Other Traits", and could even pick optional traits listed under a
different template for extra variety.

This worked out fairly well in my case because all the different people of
Tamriel have roughly the same shape and size. GURPS is a system that places a
lot of value on realism, so I imagine I would still need to keep _some_ physical
attribute adjutments in there if I were to include pixies and half-giants in the
lineup. However, in systems or campaigns where that matters less even those
wouldn't need adjustments. I plan on keeping this approach with any other such
templates I make.
