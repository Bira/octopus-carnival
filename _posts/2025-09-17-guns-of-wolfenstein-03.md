In [Part 2][1] of this series, we took a look at the guns that appear on
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, whose timeline I named "Wolfenstein-2" for ease of
reference. The timeline from the 2001 game, whose guns I talked about [here][2],
was Wolfenstein-1.

Here, we will take a look at the weapons that appear in Wolfenstein: The New
Order, a game that was published _before_ The Old Blood (2014) but whose stories
starts right when The Old Blood ends. We'll also make some mentions to the last
game in the trilogy, The New Colossus (from 2017) but the weapons that make
their debut in that game will be presented in a future post.

## The New Order Plot Overview (Contains Spoilers)

Though this game was launched a year earlier, its story starts off right after
The Old Blood ends, in 1946. After B. J. Blaskowicz returns to the Allies with
the location of General Deathshead's secret hideout, they mount a massive attack
on that island fortress. This is a higher-budget version of the final chapters
of the 2001 game, which ended with Deathshead's defeat, but things don't that
well here.

The attack is a disaster. Deathshead kills most of B.J.'s unit and leaves the
rest of them to die in a deathtrap. The survivors manage to escape just as the
room they're in explodes, but the explosion buries a large piece of shrapnel in
Blazko's brain. He washes ashore somewhere in Poland, catatonic, and since no
one knows who he is, gets sent to an asylum. He spends the next 14 years there
slowly recovering, with nearly no motor function, slipping in and out of comas.

A Nazi attack on the asylum in 1960 gives him the impulse he needs to complete
his recovery, and the first actual level of the game is escaping that situation
with a nurse named Anna, the other survivor of the place. They reach Anna's
grandparents, where Blazko learns that the Nazis won the war in 1948, and that
as far as everyone knows the last members of the resistance had been captured
and sent to an "inescapable" prison in Berlin.

The rest of the game is about freeing these prisoners, rebuilding the
resistance, and striking back at Deathshead through a series of daring
heists. These start with the rescue of good-guy super-scientist Seth Roth[^1],
and proceed with the the capture of a giant enemy submarine, the recovery of its
nuclear launch codes from a Nazi base on the Moon, and finally an attack on
Deathshead's fortress.

Blazko manages to kill Deathshead during the second attack on his fortress,
though the asshole manages to detonate a grenade as he dies. The game ends as
B. J., too wounded to evacuate, gives his allies the all-clear to launch the
nuke that will destroy this fortress for good.

## The Guns

The vast majority of the guns here are, again, captured Nazi hardware. And
those, in turn, are "new and improved" versions of the guns we saw in The Old
Blood.

Their actual mechanics and list of available weapons changes a bit between this
game and its sequel in ways that can be better explained by changes in artistic
and gameplay direction than by in-setting developments. The weapons presented
here are based partially on a melding of their two versions, and partially on
what I'd think would be more interesting for a GURPS Action game.

This post focuses on the weapons that make their first appearance in The New
Order. The next one will present the ones that first appear in The New Colossus,
using the same adaptation strategy.

I'm omitting price information as usual. In a Wolfenstein-inspired game, PCs
will be picking these up from the corpses of their enemies. In other games, the
GM can figure out a price based on the prices of similar real-world weapons.

### Pistols

#### Pistol Model 1960

A direct descendant of the 1946 model, this one has a more futuristic look, a
double-stacked 20-round magazine, and the ability to fire 3-round bursts. It
still takes the same cinematic silencer. As before, it adds -1 to Bulk, makes
the gun cinematically silent, and also makes it only able to fire in semi-auto
mode (RoF 3).

If using standard GURPS skills, you need Guns (Pistol) to fire in semi-auto
mode, and Guns (SMG) to fire bursts. If using the optional skills from Pyramid
#3/65, you need Guns (Pistol), with the Burst-Fire technique for firing bursts.

| TL | Weapon      | Damage  | Acc | Range    | Weight      | RoF | Shots   | ST | Bulk | Rcl |
|:--:|:-----------:|:-------:|:---:|:--------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-------:|:--:|:----:|:----|
| 8  | Pistol 1960 | 2d+2 pi | 2   | 160/1800 | 1.4kg/0.5kg | 9   | 20+1(3) | 10 | -2   | 2   |


### Long Arms

In the standard system, use the Guns skill that corresponds to their description
(SMG, Shotgun, Rifle).

If you're using the alternate skills from Pyramid #3/65, they all use Guns (Long
Arm), of course. The Burst-Fire technique helps fire weapons at a RoF greater
than 3 without penalty.

#### American Submachine Gun

This is pretty much a historical **Thompson M1A1**, described in p. HT122. The
Allies mostly didn't have access to superscience in this timeline and were
limited to historical equipment.

Allied soldiers are armed with this during the 1946 assault on Deathshead's
compound, and the game expects you to use them for the handful of minutes
between the start of gameplay and the moment when you first grab an enemy
weapon.

#### Assault Rifle Model 1960

An evolution of the 1946 model, it's lighter and uses a double-stacked 45 round
magazine, but still fires the same round. The biggest change here is an
underbarrel accessory rail that can take a mini-rocket launcher, which appears
as an upgrade midway through the game. This is detailed in the Launchers
section.

#### Marksman Rifle 1960

This semi-automatic rifle is about the same length as the AR, but fires a
heftier round (likely 7.92x57mm) from a 10-round magazine. It has an integral
scope. It's a relatively rare find both in the hands of enemies and as
loot. Clearly the Nazis are bigger fans of the spray-and-pray approach to
marksmanship.

An extended 30-round magazine is available: Shots 30+1(3), Weight becomes
6.2kg/1.05kg. The gun can also fire APHC rounds: Dam 6d+2(2) pi-.

#### Shockhammer Model 1960

Another descendant of the gun from The Old Blood, this one uses a "snail drum"
magazine and a single barrel to achieve better performance than its
predecessor. The most commonly available shells for the weapon are standard
buckshot, and "shrapnel".

Shrapnel shells fire red-hot fragments that ricochet off walls in a very
video-gamey way, allowing the player to hit enemies behind cover or around
corners by bouncing the shrapnel off the wall behind them. The shotgun can only
fire in semi-auto mode while using these shells.

For the GURPS version below, I'm treating shrapnel as Multi-Flechette shells
(High-Tech p. 174) with an incendiary effect. Damage becomes 1d+1 pi- inc; Range
becomes 100/1200; RoF becomes 3x20. GMs who wish to replicate the ricochet
effect can reduce the penalty for firing at targets behind cover when there are
suitable surfaces nearby.

At the GM's discretion, any special shells listed in High Tech and Ultra-Tech
might also be available for this shotgun.

### Energy Weapons

There is a surprising amount of energy weapons in both games. All of these use
Beam Weapons (Rifle) unless noted otherwise.

Laser weapons in this setting draw power from internal batteries that can't be
removed without disassembling the weapon. The usual method of reloading them is
by using one of the highly dangerous industrial power outlets that seem to be
everywhere in Nazi-dominated cities and facilities.

In The New Order, these use short-ranged wireless power transfer. In The New
Colossus, they use a thick cable with a plug that resembles a gas station
pump. I suggest picking an aesthethic and sticking to it.

**Wireless Charging**: The wielder must stay within 2 meters of the outlet
during the process, which causes lightning to arc between the outlet and the
weapon's power receptors. Doing anything with the weapon other than holding it
steady will interrupt the recharge.

**Wired Charging**: The wielder must plug the cable into the weapon (1 Ready
Action), and then stay within 1 meter of the outlet. The weapon cannot be used
while charging. Once charging is done, it takes another Ready maneuver to unplug
it.

Recharge time is listed for each weapon, and has more to do with the weapon's
ability to absorb incoming power than with the outlet's ability to provide it!
The later seems to be effectively limitless, at least on a personal scale. Yes,
these things are extremely unsafe. What happens if you stab someone with the
wired plug or intercept them with the arc of the wireless charger is left as an
exercise for the GM.

In some places you can also find portable batteries that can be used to top up a
weapon through a similar process. The GM will say how many shots from a weapon
an individual battery can recharge.

#### Lunar Laser Rifle

On the Moonbase level of The New Order, everyone carries a laser weapon with the
same external appearance as the Marksman Rifle. It lacks a scope, and can fire
in full-auto mode. Its performance seems to be about on par with the assault
rifle, though it is a lot better at dealing with heavily-armored
enemies. Industrial outlets recharge it at 3 shots per second.

Despite being a laser weapon based on the Marksman Rifle, Nazi soldiers don't
usually use Aim maneuvers with it, so they are no more accurate than usual when
wielding it.

It doesn't exist in The New Colossus, not even on Venus. Maybe it was a pet
project of Deathshead's for the moon base, and got phased out when he died.

#### Marksman Rifle (Combined)

When you return to Earth after the Moonbase level, B.J.'s Marksman Rifle becomes
a combination gadget of sorts, with the scope on a hinged mount. With the mount
closed and the scope in place, it fires bullets as before. With the scope folded
away, it behaves like the Moonbase laser rifle.

This design is probably more of a video game quality of life decision than
something feasible in setting, but if you want to include it in your campaigns
you can treat it as a Combination Gadget per the rules on Ultra-Tech p. 16.

Under those rules, Weight becomes 8kg/0.35kg (or 8.7/1.05 with the extended
mag). Switching modes requires a Ready maneuver, and the weapon uses the Damage,
Acc, Range, RoF, Shots and ST of whatever version is the currently active
one. Keep track of both ammo counts separately!

#### Laserkraftwerk

This is an experimental laser weapon that B. J. "liberates" from a lab early in
The New Order. It's about carbine-sized, and fires shots that are more powerful
than those of the lunar laser rifle.

The LKW also has an alternate "laser cutter" module that's useful for quietly
severing chains and cutting through chain-link fences and thin metal walls. This
does 2d(2) burn and can run continuously for half an hour on a full battery, if
it matters.

Over the course of the game, the player can find several upgrades for the LKW,
including a scope, a double-capacity battery, and new internal parts that allow
it to fire more often or to fire a more powerful "charged" shot that's better at
dealing with large and heavily armored opponents.

In the Weapon Table below, you get stats both for the baseline version and the
fully-upgraded one.

Industrial outlets recharge the weapon at a rate of 1 shot per second with the
standard battery, or 2 shots per second with the expanded one. The final upgrade
in The New Order is an "ancient supertech" portable reactor that recharges the
weapon at a rate of 1 shot per 2 seconds whenever it's not being fired,
regardless of its battery size.

*: See description for recharge time.

**: Drains power equivalent to 5 shots from the battery.


### Grenades and Launchers

Enemy soldiers are enthusiastic about using hand grenades in the The New Order,
and only a little less so in The New Colossus. Launcher weapons are much rarer.

In The New Order, enemies use the same **Hand Grenade** from the previous post
in the 1946 prologue. By 1960 they've switched to using Tesla grenades
exclusively.
#### Tesla Grenade

This looks like a modernized version of the Stick Hand Grenade used back
in 1946. Its explosive power is equivalent, but also releases an electromagnetic
pulse that can "stun" robotic and cybernetic enemies in a 4-meter radius from
the epicenter of the explosion. They must make a HT-8(2) roll or be knocked out
of action for seconds equal to their margin of failure. That (2) means that any
electromagnetic shielding that would provide a bonus to this roll only works at
half effectiveness.

This _also_ applies to battery-powered weapons of any kind, which usually have
HT 12.

#### Underbarrel Rocket Launcher

An accessory compatible with the 1960 Assault Rifle, this launcher fires 40mm
anti-armor rockets from a removable cylinder with a 4-round capacity. It's
issued to soldiers that are expected to go against heavily-armored opposition,
and who are usually heavily-armored themselves.

The launcher can only be used if it's attached to another weapon. By default
that's the assault rifle, which has the rails to receive it, but players might
decide to get creative with their jury-rigging. It adds its weight to the
overall weight of the other weapon and worsens its Bulk by -1.

In the standard skill system, this uses the Guns (LAW) skill. In the alternate
one, it's Guns (Long Arm) aided by the Payload Warhead technique.

#### Hand Grenade Table

| TL  | Weapon             | Damage       | Weight | Fuse | Bulk |

### Heavy Weapons

#### Laser Machine Gun

The old Venom machine gun from the war has been replaced with this energy weapon
in the Sixties. Like its predecessor, the Laser MG is found in fixed mounts, in
the hands of cybernetic supersoldiers, and mounted on the many models of giant
robot stomping around. It can fire for quite a bit before running dry. This can
look like either a sequence of rapid pulses or a continuous beam, but either
version uses the same stats. Enemies don't like to aim with it either, improving
the players' chances of survival when facing it. It's heavy and bulky enough to
be only a "sometimes" gun for the player, used when found and quickly discarded
when empty.

Industrial outlets reload it at a rate of 20 shots per second. When attached to
a fixed mount, the weapon's Acc improves to 18, and it's recharged as if
connected to an outlet when not firing. Attaching or detaching it takes 2 Ready
maneuvers. The weapon uses the Gunner (Beams) skill even when detached.

#### Heavy Weapon Table

| TL   | Weapon   | Damage     | Acc | Range    | Weight | RoF | Shots | ST  | Bulk | Rcl |
|:----:|:--------:|:----------:|:---:|:--------:|:------:|:---:|:-----:|:---:|:----:|:----|
| 8+2^ | Laser MG | 6d(2) burn | 12  | 700/2100 | 25kg   | 10  | 200*  | 15M | -8   | 1   |

[^1]: Seth belongs to the Da'at Yichud, an ancient society of engineers that had
    been building superscience devices as a form of worship since before the
    rest of humanity had organized religion. Deathshead's inventions are all
    copied from one of their vaults, which he found in the 40s. I've seen the
    concept described as kinda problematic despite the designers' best
    intentions.
