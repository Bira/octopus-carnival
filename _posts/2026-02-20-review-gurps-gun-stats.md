Imagine the following situation: you want to feature a certain gun in your
campaign, but you want to do it "properly". You're not the kind of GM who would
feel good about just tossing some random numbers in there.

The weapon in question is not in any of your books, and it's different enough
from the ones that are that you can't just reskin an existing gun. That'd be the
same as using random numbers.

If the story above resonated with you, then you'll love GURPS Gun Stats. It
gives you an official system to write up GURPS 4th Edition stats for guns
starting from their real world data. If the lack of these rules stopped you
before, you'll love this book.

Sure, players who were really into statting up guns might already have been
doing this for years by either building them using the rules from GURPS Vehicles
for 3rd edition, or by using a [very scary unofficial spreadsheet][1] cooked up
by Douglas Cole for his own use. Gun Stats is still useful for them, as it's
much simpler than the spreadsheet.

## How It Looks

This is a typical Warehouse 23 PDF. All black and white, with the by now
classical GURPS two-column layout. Its written by David Pulver with additional
material by S.A. Fisher Hans-Christian Vortisch, which is kind of a seal of
quality in itself when it comes to gun-nut material in GURPS.

The interior art is mostly a mix of illustrations clearly based on photos or 3D
models with a weird "acid etching" surface filter applied to them to unify the
look. You also have a few hand-drawn illustrations. The art credits are fairly
long, listing several photo repositories and 3D studios in addition to a couple
of individual artists. I admit the "acid etching" filter made me take a closer
look, but I believe all the art in this book is either drawn or edited by human
hands.

The Totally-Not-From-Assassin's Creed lady on page 9 has a bit of an awkward
pose, but it's organic awkwardness. The rest of the pieces are fine, and look
good without getting in the way of the text.

## How It Works

One thing I found nifty about the book is that it's more than a collection of
formulas. It has some instruction on how to actually do the research to get that
real-life gun data, and a little checklist. You'll need things like the empty
weight, barrel length and overall length of the gun itself; the weight and
dimensions of its projectile and of the whole cartridge; and how much propellant
it uses per shot.

Some of those stats (like the weights and costs) can be written straight into
the stat sheet, while others are used in relatively simple equations to derive
stuff like damage, Accuracy, and range.

And that's it. While those simple calculations can still be a little intense
they'll get you the results you want.

At the end of the book you have a printable checklist for your own research, and
three example weapons: a French anti-material rifle, a 19th-century 6-pounder
cannon, and the gun on the M1A2 Abrams tank.

## Caveats and Annoyances

The book works best when dealing with historical or modern guns that have ample
information available to the public, whether in Wikipedia, more specialized
sites, or even sales brochures. The less information is available for a specific
weapon, the more you'll have to guesstimate when filling your checklist.

You can already see this with the Abrams tank gun here. Recent data about it and
its ammunition is classified, so they either use Gulf War-era information or
just make educated guesses about some of its measurements.

Fictional guns will often be harder, because they very often lack a lot of
measurements entirely, as those weren't necessary to tell the story. You'll have
to come up with those yourself, or maybe go looking for the work of other fans
who have already spent a ton of time doing exactly that.

This is all perfectly doable, but presumably you wanted this book because you
didn't want to guess all the numbers. On the other hand, doing this will give
you a pretty good ideas of the ways in which this or that fictional weapon is
unrealistic.

A final annoyance for me specifically: like all other GURPS books, this one uses
Imperial measurements exclusively for its calculations. Yes, even though modern
gun data is often presented in metric. You gotta convert all of that to feet,
pounds, and inches before doing the work, which is doubly annoying to me because
I'm going to convert a lot of that right back for the final writeups.

## Final Impressions

GURPS Gun Stats gives me the same impression as a classical UNIX or Linux
command line tool. It's designed to do one job, it does that job pretty well
despite some usability issues, and it has a lot of options that can be difficult
to remember without looking at the documentation.

If you need to do that job, this is the tool for you, and the learning curve is
worth it. If you're happy to just toss some eyeballed stats onto a table and
call it a day, then you can skip it.
