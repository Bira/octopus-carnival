In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game.  Links to all of them will appear in
the [project page][1], which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions. Also, I wish the names of the two versions were a bit less similar.

Today's the template is the Druid, which means today's subject is Lini. Here she
is:

You can find her full bio [here][4], and her original Pathfinder
stats [here][5]. From looking at these, we see the following:

* Lini is a Golarion gnome, which is different from the Dungeon Fantasy gnome.

* She is a druid and hails from the Land of the Linnorm Kings, home of the
  Not-Vikings. She was always good with animals, and left the place shortly
  after meeting her snow leopard animal companion.

* She wields a sickle and a sling, but prefers to send her animal companion to
  fight for her. Her magic is more or less even mix of terrain-affecting,
  support and attack spells. She is also described as having a knack for
  handling animals, particularly large mammals.

Lini is the first character that presents us with some real difficulties in
adaptation. Not because of her "exotic" race, since I've [statted that one up in
its own article][2], but because the DFRPG boxed set doesn't have rules for
animal companions! In fact, it doesn't even have the Ally advantage, which
they're based on.

This lines up with their goals of presenting a "streamlined" set of rules, since
Allies can bring a surprising amount of complexity to a game. They're the only
NPCs whose points you have to keep track of, and you need to remember to give
them points in the correct ratio to keep them at the same percentage as the
PC. Still, their lack prevents us from being truly faithful to Lini's Pathfinder
version.

This is what she ended up like:

## Lini, 250-point Fey Gnome Druid.

## Design Notes and What Changed

This version of Lini lacks her snow leopard animal companion, as there are no
rules for them in the boxed set. She has the Speak with Animals power instead.

If you have access to the full GURPS rules and to GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 5:
Allies, then you can replace the Speak with Animals power with a 18-point
Panther natural ally, 1 point in the Beast-Speech spell, and another 4
elsewhere.

If you don't, a rough approximation is to use the Lion from DF: Monsters. It
would cost 12 points to have that beast always be by your side, and it would
gain 1 character point to improve itself for every 2 points you gained. Buying
it would again involve replacing the Speak with Animals power and redistributing
the left-over points as above.

Aside from that, the other big change is once again her gear, which is costlier
and heavier. Though her weapons do a bit more damage, Lini is still better off
using spells or talking animals into fighting for her.
