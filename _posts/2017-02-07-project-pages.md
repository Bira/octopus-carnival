Octopus Carnival now has enough material in it that I thought it was time for a
little organization. At the top of the site you should now see a "Projects"
link, which will take to a page linking to all of the big thematic post
collections I'm working on or have finished already. From there, you can go to
individual project pages that discuss its overall goals and link to every
individual post.

As of this post, I have pages for the [Dragon's Dogma adaptation][1], and my
collection of [GURPS stats for Pathfinder Iconics][2]. If you haven't followed
either of those from the beginning, now would be an excellent time to get
reacquainted with them.

In the future, I'll add tag support to the blog to make it even easier to
navigate between posts in a project.
