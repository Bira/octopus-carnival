As I explained in my [previous post][1], now that the DFRPG has been published
and is nearly available for sale, I'm redoing my set of Pathfinder
Iconics. Since the professional templates names haven't changed, Amiri the
Barbarian is once again our first subject. We'll repeat the summary of her bio
with the link to the full d20 stats so you don't need to read both articles to
understand the character. If you're curious, you can see a link to the old
article at the end of this one, along with a discussion on what changed from one
to the other.

Amiri's full official bio and character sheet can be found [here][3]. Judging
from those, we can glean a few facts about her:

* Amiri is good at outdoor survival in cold climates, since she returned from a
  "suicide" scouting mission.

* Amiri is of normal human size, but fights with an oversized sword that used to
  belong to a frost giant.

* She's fiercely competitive and doesn't like being outdone at barbarian
  heroing.

* She relies a lot on the d20 Barbarian Rage power when fighting, and might get
  angry enought to lose her mind. In other words, the purpose of Amiri is to
  flip out and kill people.

Here's what she looks like in the new rules:

## Design Notes

Amiri spent 2 points on extra starting cash to buy the big sword.

### Changes from the First Iteration

You can see her GURPS Dungeon Fantasy version [here][2]. Like in the previous
iteration, Amiri is still pretty faithful to her bio and original stats, but
some things had to change to fit the DFRPG ruleset.

The biggest one that the Great Rage powerup does not exist in the boxed set, so
she can't have it here. The 20 points it cost instead went to buy 2 more points
of ST, which turned out to be a pretty good compromise! The new Amiri might not
be quite as strong as the old one while her Rage was on, but she's stronger at
all other times and doesn't need to worry about keeping track of rage-induced
Fatigue.

Another noticeable change is that her giant sword is slightly smaller here, as
there are no rules for oversized weapons in the boxed set. This ends up working
in her favor, as the new weapon is much cheaper and lighter while doing only one
less point of damage (the loss of which is compensated by her higher ST). In the
end, we can just say it was a giant's shortsword instead of a giant's broadsword
and call it a day.

And while we're speaking of equipment, you might notice her armor is
significantly different now. It was built using the **GURPS Low-Tech**-inspired
rules from the boxed set. Torso and head DR are lower, but now her limbs are
covered. This is roughly equivalent to the hide armor listed in the d20 stats,
so I'm happy.
