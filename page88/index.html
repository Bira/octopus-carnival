<p>Giants are present in D&amp;D since the beginning, making up one of the games most
famous “monster ladders”. How famous? It got a whole module trilogy to itself,
named Against the Giants, which got reprised and homaged in several editions
after its debut on AD&amp;D 1st Edition. You could have named the game Gaols &amp;
Giants without changing anything else, and no one would find it odd that they’re
in the title.</p>

<p>As you’d expect from monsters with such an exalted pedigree, they are present in
both books. Between both of them we have no less than six giant types, each with
multiple stat blocks, so I’m going to give a general overview of giant-kind
in this post and cover each type in its own installment.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-origin-of-giants">On the Origin of Giants</h2>

<p>Giants in 4e all share a common origin: they were among the first beings created
by the primordials, stepping out into the newly-created world before it had even
cooled from the forge. Their purpose in life was to assist their masters in
exploring and shaping this new creation. This means they could dispute the
efreets’ claims of being the firsborn children of the Primordials, if they cared
to.</p>

<p>Well, if you want to get technical about it, the beings created directly by the
primordials are <em>Titans</em>. They they embody the qualities of the Elemental Chaos
to such a degree that their bodies are made of elemental matter instead of that
gross meat stuff. The Titans went about their mission for a while, but
eventually found out that the world was too large for them to do it
efficiently. So they created servitors of their own to help them in turn.</p>

<p>These servitors are the Giants proper. They’re smaller than their titanic
progenitors, and made of flesh and bone because they’re more closely aligned
with the world than with the Elemental Chaos. (From this point on, I’m using
capital-G Giants to mean both titans and giants).</p>

<p>In the course of their mission, the Giants multiplied and spread throughout the
world and the planes, and when the Primordials retreated from the world they
inherited it, and created one of its first empires. It was around this time that
the creations of the gods began to appear, and the Giants were already there to
enslave them. Most notable among these slaves were the dwarves, children of
Moradin, whose entire population endured a centuries-long period of cruel
servitude.</p>

<p>When the Dawn War started, the titans and giants sided with the
primordials. Though there weren’t many of them, their immense individual power
gave them victory in many battles, filling their castles with pillaged
loot. Attrition from the long war took its toll even on these mighty beings,
though, allowing the sudden dwarven rebellion to succeed and deal the final blow
to their empire.</p>

<p>Today’s giants are still sore about their downfall. They dream of casting down
the gods and rebuilding what they had, but they never managed to organize enough
to pull it off in all the intervening millenia. Today they live in scattered and
isolated communities, who fight each other as much as they terrorize the
surrounding small ‘uns. The causes for all this infighting are a bit opaque and
convoluted. They probably stretch back long enough that those Viking tales of
multi-decade feuds sound quaint to a giant.</p>

<h2 id="giant-stat-overview">Giant Stat Overview</h2>

<p>The most famous giant and titan signature trait is that they’re really big!
Giants are on the larger end of Large, and Titans cross over into Huge. All of
them have the Giant keyword as well, and though most giants have the Elemental
origin due to the story above, there are some interesting exceptions. Each giant
type has further signature traits that will be discussed in their own posts.</p>

<p>Level-wise, they range from early Paragon to late Epic tier. Within that range,
giants are usually regulars, with Titans being both Elite and a few levels
stronger than their corresponding giants.</p>

<p>Between the Monster Manual and the Monster Vault, we get the following giant
types, arranged from weakest to strongest: Earth, Ice, Fire, Death and
Storm. Each type presents one or more giant stat blocks and one Titan.</p>

<p>That first category includes Hill Giants - Stone giants also exist and fall
under Earth, but don’t appear in the first Monster Manual or on the Vault.</p>

<p>The first three rungs of this ladder comprise the Against the Giants set, which
means those modules could make a fine Paragon-tier campaign for 4e.</p>

<p>Ghouls have been in D&amp;D since the beginning, which makes them an example of two
classic D&amp;D practices: arranging monsters in a power ladder, and making every
synonym of a word into a different monster.</p>

<p>They were a step up from zombies in the undead power ladder, and since the word
“zombie” in D&amp;D applied to slow shamblers, the faster and more voracious “Romero
Zombies” got called Ghouls. Here, they’re present in both books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>When someone who practices cannibalism dies, they rise as a ghoul. Ghouls can
also be created through necromantic rituals, like zombies or skeletons. In
previous editions someone killed by a ghoul would also rise as one - while that
can certainly still be the case here, it’s not encoded in their combat stat
blocks.</p>

<p>A ghoul doesn’t retain any of the memories or personality it had in life, and is
driven by an insatiable hunger for sapient flesh. It’s still sapient itself, and
potentially very smart! The ones we get in this entry range from Int 10 to Int
19.</p>

<p>Many ghouls turn to religion, surprisingly. The patron of ghouls is Dorensain,
an exarch of Orcus who has a domain in the Abyss known as the White Kingdom
because it’s made entirely of bones. Dorensain’s castle is made out of the
hollowed-out, petrified body of a still-living primordial, and from there he
grants blessings upon his most favored ghouls. These Abyssal Ghouls make up the
bulk of his Court of Teeth, and sometimes go out into the world or the other
planes to do his bidding.</p>

<p>Ghouls are typically Chaotic Evil.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>“Standard” ghouls are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead keyword. Abyssal
ghouls are Elemental instead. They all have darkvision, are immune to disease
and poison, and have Resist 10 Necrotic. They’re also pretty fast, with a land
speed of 8 and a climb speed of 4. Most of them also have some ability to
immobilize the people they attack, but that takes a different form for each
ghoul.</p>

<p>And speaking of “different”, the stat blocks are different enough between books
that I’m going to deal with them separately.</p>

<h3 id="ghoul-mm">Ghoul (MM)</h3>

<p>The classic model is a Level 5 Soldier with 63 HP and all standard ghoul traits
plus Vulnerable 5 Radiant. It’s also one of the nastier surprises in the MM,
similar to needlefang drake swarms.</p>

<p>You see, the ghoul’s basic attack is a claw that immobilizes (save ends) on a
hit. Its other attack is a bite that can only be used on an immobilized, stunned
or unconscious target, does roughly double the damage of a claw, and stuns (save
ends).</p>

<p>Soldiers in the first Monster Manual have an extra +2 to hit when compared to
other roles; and while the ghoul’s bite has a slightly lower attack bonus than
the claw, that will be frequently offset by combat advantage (either from being
stunned/unconscious, or from flanking). So ghouls will hit very often with
attacks that carry potentially crippling riders.</p>

<p>This means that a level 5 party coming up against an equal number of ghouls is
in for a genuine Romero Zombie experience as they get swarmed, immobilized by
claws, paralyzed by bites, and eaten. Don’t be that party. Don’t get into melee
with ghouls.</p>

<h3 id="ghoul-mv">Ghoul (MV)</h3>

<p>The MV ghoul is surprisingly similar, remaining a Level 5 Soldier with the same
HP and common traits. The radiant vulnerability is replaced by Weakened
Paralysis, a trait that allows a creature immobilized or stunned by the ghoul to
roll an extra save whenever the monster takes radiant damage.</p>

<p>The ghoul’s claws lose the extra soldier attack bonus, which was removed by the
new math. Both it and the bite had their damage increased, however, and retain
their riders.</p>

<p>The end result is a monster that’s still dangerous in melee, but will hit less
often and give any party with a divine character in it a lot more chances to
save against its paralytic attacks. Use this one and ignore the MM version.</p>

<h3 id="ravenous-ghoul-mv">Ravenous Ghoul (MV)</h3>

<p>This one is closer to a classic Romero Zombie than to the classic ghoul we saw
above. It doesn’t paralyze, it just runs at you and tears you apart.</p>

<p>The Ravenous Ghoul is a Level 5 Brute with 76 HP and all common ghoul traits,
including Vulnerable 5 Radiant. It’s a bit dumber than the classic model, at Int
8.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a claw that does level-appropriate Brute damage, and it also
has a Ravenous Bite on Recharge 5-6 that’s a bit stronger and does ongoing
damage (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="horde-ghoul-mm">Horde Ghoul (MM)</h3>

<p>This Level 13 Minion Brute represents a classic ghoul when met by more powerful
adventurers. It shares all common ghoul traits except for the radiant
vulnerability, which doesn’t make sense in a minion. Its single attack is a claw
that does a bit of damage and immobilizes (save ends).</p>

<p>As the name implies, they should come in hordes!</p>

<h3 id="abyssal-ghoul-mm">Abyssal Ghoul (MM)</h3>

<p>The favored servants of Dorensain, and likely equivalent to ghasts in previous
editions. They’re Level 16 Skirmishers with 156 HP and all common ghoul traits,
including the radiant vulnerability.</p>

<p>Abyssal ghouls are surrounded by a Sepuchral Stench (Aura 3), which inflicts a
-2 penalty to the defenses of anyone caught in its area. They attack with a bite
that damages and immobilizes on a hit (save ends), and deals extra damage to
targets who are already immobilized/stunned/unconscious.</p>

<p>When killed, the abyssal ghoul explodes in a cloud of Dead Blood, dealing an
automatic 10 necrotic damage to every enemy in a Close Burst 1.</p>

<p>Unlike classical ghouls, they lack the ability to stun their victims, and so are
actually a bit less dangerous after accounting for the level
difference. Immobilized victims can fight back just fine, they just can’t move
to another square.</p>

<h3 id="abyssal-ghoul-mv">Abyssal Ghoul (MV)</h3>

<p>The MV version of the Abyssal Ghoul is a bit stronger and skirmisher-er. It
trades the radiant vulnerability for a trait called Hindering Light, which
prevents it from shifting for a turn when it takes radiant damage.</p>

<p>Its bite damage was fixed while keeping the immobilization rider, and it now
allows the ghoul to shift 3 squares as an <em>effect</em>, which accounts for the
“skirmisher-er” part.</p>

<h3 id="abyssal-ghoul-devourer-mv">Abyssal Ghoul Devourer (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 16 Lurker has 118 HP and all common ghoul traits. It’s Vulnerable 5
to Radiant damage and projects the same stench as the standard abyssal ghoul.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Grasping Claw, which on a hit does a little damage and
grabs the target (escape DC 22). The ghoul can grab up to two victims that way,
and while it’s grabbing somebody it will only take half damage from any attack,
redirecting the other half to the victim. What should you do when it has two
victims? I’m leaning towards chosing one at random to take half the damage.</p>

<p>The claw’s weak damage is more than made up by Devour, an attack the ghoul can
use on one of its grabbed victims. A hit does a chunk of immediate damage plus
ongoing damage (save ends). A miss does half damage and half the ongoing damage
of a hit. In either case the ghoul releases the victim.</p>

<p>To top it off, the ghoul can pull its grabbed victims along with it when it
moves, without provoking opportunity attacks from the victims. So it’s going to
carry the unfortunates off to a more protected spot before it uses Devour on
them.</p>

<h3 id="abyssal-ghoul-hungerer-both">Abyssal Ghoul Hungerer (Both)</h3>

<p>A Level 18 Minion Soldier, and basically a stronger version of the Horde
Ghoul. It lacks the stench aura but keeps Dead Blood, which does a bit more
damage on the MV version than in the MM one. Pop them from a distance.</p>

<p>There’s also an Abyssal Ghoul Myrmidon in the MM which is just a Level 23
version of the hungerer, and as such I’m not giving it its own header.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>We get four, spanning the entire level range.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 2 ghouls, 2 boneshard skeletons, 1 wraith. Oh joy!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: 5 horde ghouls, 3 stirge swarms, 1 lich. Mastermind and pets,
basically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 16: 3 abyssal ghouls and 1 human death knight. Perhaps the ghouls were
its squires in life.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 21: 5 abyssal ghoul myrmidons, 1 larva mage, 1 death giant. That Kyuss
guy sure gets around.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>If you’re playing D&amp;D, you gotta have ghouls. The MV assortment is the superior
one, so use that if possible.</p>

<p>D&amp;D is famous for making every synonym of a word into an entirely separate
monster, and nowhere is this more obvious than with incorporeal undead. Previous
editions had wraiths, specters, phantoms, haunts and ghosts be entirely
different monsters, and getting them mixed up was likely the cause of death for
quite a few PCs.</p>

<p>The decision to allow multiple stat blocks in the same monster entry has
consolidated things a bit, but not entirely (wraiths and specters are still
their own thing, for example). Ghosts appear only in the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As you would expect, ghosts are the spirits of sapient creatures that died with
unfinished business that caused them to linger in the world. They look like,
well, ghostly versions of their appearance in life, and if their deaths were
violent they might still bear the wounds that killed them. That’s not always
true, though: some ghosts look angelic or horrific regardless of their causes of
death, and some can change appearance to suit their current mood.</p>

<p>Ghosts are almost always near where they died. They usually keep most of their
memories and personalities, but the trauma of death or the long years of
haunting might change them.</p>

<p>Getting rid of a ghost might be as simple as defeating it in combat, but some of
them are so bound to the world that they reform after a day or so. In these
cases, the only way to make the ghost go away is to finish whatever business is
keeping it chained to the mortal plane. Fortunately, these are usually the
ghosts most willing to talk things out, asking the PCs for help with their
affairs or at least providing some hints of how to solve them during their mad
ramblings.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The signature traits of ghosts are obvious: they’re immune to disease and
poison, insubstantial, have phasing, and fly with hover capability. All ghosts
statted up here have Speed 6, but if you’re turning a faster creature into a
ghost I’d let it keep the higher value.</p>

<p>“Insubstantial” has a very specific meaning in the 4e ruleset: insubstantial
creatures take half damage from all sources. This damage is halved after all
other modifiers are applied, including any resistances and
vulnerabilities. While this means everyone can do <em>some</em> damage to an
insubstantial creature, it also means that no damage type is inherently more
effective against it either! Individual might still have additional traits that
make certain damage types ignore their insubstantiality or turn them temporarily
substantial.</p>

<p>“Phasing” means the creature ignores difficult terrain and can move through
solid surfaces, though it must always end its movement in an unoccupied
space. It’s separate from insubstantiality because a monster can have one but
not the other.</p>

<p>Ghosts have both, and together with the flight speed this means they have full
3D movement and can come at you from any direction at all. Their attacks also
never target AC, to represent the fact that they phase through armor.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-warrior">Phantom Warrior</h3>

<p>Soldiers who died in battle, still fighting their wars or performing their
patrols. They’re Level 4 Soldiers with 40 HP and all common ghost traits. They
attack with a Phantom Sword (Melee 1 vs. Reflex) that does necrotic damage and
marks for a turn. Their military training manifests as the Phantom Tactics
ability, giving them combat advantage against target that has another phantom
warrior adjacent to it.</p>

<p>A simple and workable soldier monster. All it needs is a damage fix for its
sword, which does roughly half the damage it should do due to that “naturalistic
design” thing.</p>

<h3 id="trap-haunt">Trap Haunt</h3>

<p>The ghost of someone killed by a trap, who believes feeding others to the trap
is the only way for it to move on. This Level 8 Lurker has 52 HP and all common
ghost traits. It’s bound to the trap that killed it, and is always found close
to it.</p>

<p>The haunt’s Grave Touch (Melee 1 vs. Fortitude) does a pitiful 2d6 necrotic
damage and should probably be fixed. The real danger here is its Ghostly
Possession (Melee 1 vs. Will), though. A hit dominates the target (save ends)
and removes the haunt from the map while this effect lasts. The haunt will use
this to walk the possessed target into the trap that killed it.</p>

<p>The Trap Haunt can’t voluntarily move more than 20 squares away from said
trap. If pushed beyond this range, it becomes weakened until it goes back.</p>

<h3 id="wailing-ghost-banshee">Wailing Ghost (Banshee)</h3>

<p>This one used to be a separate monster, and specifically the ghost of an
elf. It’s now under the Ghost entry, and can be of any species. Traditionally,
banshees appear to people who are about to die, which in D&amp;D means they’ll be
looking to murder a specific party member. It’s a level 12 controller with 91 HP
and all common ghost traits.</p>

<p>The banshee’s basic attack is a Spirit Touch (Melee 1 vs. Reflex) that does
necrotic damage, like most other ghosts. The real standout here is the
Terrifying Shriek (Close Burst 5 vs. Will; Recharge 5-6) which does psychic
damage, pushes the targets 3 squares, and immobilizes them (save ends).</p>

<p>They can also display Death’s Visage to one unlucky soul (usually the one
they’re trying to kill). This is a Ranged 5 attack vs. Will, which does psychic
damage and inflicts a -2 penalty to all the target’s defenses (save ends).</p>

<p>Being a controller means the banshee can hold its own in melee combat, but it’s
rarely going to bother. It will phase through walls and floors to keep away
from the party, returning to shriek at them when the power recharges and to
attack its chosen target with Death’s Visage once it’s immobile.</p>

<p>As a level 12 monster, the banshee is severely hampered by the twin flaws of the
damage bug and naturalistic design. All of its attacks do pathetic damage, which
should be fixed ASAP if you plan to use one in your game.</p>

<h3 id="tormenting-ghost">Tormenting Ghost</h3>

<p>This is probably the monster most in line with the classic Ghost from previous
editions, which was among the most terrifying undead. It’s a Level 21 Controller
with 152 HP, and the only ghost with an actively Evil alignment (even the
banshee is Unaligned). It also has all common ghost traits.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Spirit Touch (Melee 1 vs. Reflex) that really needs its
damage fixed. It can use the same Ghostly Possession as the Trap Haunt, and
release a Burst of Terror that’s pretty much an up-gunned version of the
banshee’s wail: Close Burst 5 vs Will, targets take necrotic damage, are pushed
5 squares, dazed and immobilized (save ends both).</p>

<p>It can also create a zone of Ghostly Terrain by filling it up with spectral
wisps and creepy whispers (Area Burst 1 within 10). Targets caught inside the
zone are immobilized (save ends). Each zone lasts until the end of the encounter
and the ghost can create them at will!</p>

<p>Finally, it can shift 3 squares as a reaction to being missed with a melee
attack, which makes it hard to pin down.</p>

<p>If you fix the damage of its attacks, the Tormenting Ghost becomes a pretty good
epic-level enemy. Having more than one of them ensures the entire combat area
will be ghostly terrain before long, allowing the ghosts and their artillery
buddies to shoot the immobilized PCs at their leisure. These are epic level PCs
and you shouldn’t go easy on them!</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>We get three encounters here:</p>

  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 4 phantom warriors and a specter. And here was thinking the wraith
was the only synonym monster that kept its entry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 2 trap haunts, 2 flameskulls, and a flame jet trap. I guess these
flameskulls aren’t the friendly type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 2 tormenting ghosts, 1 larva mage, and 3 rot harbingers. “Larva
Mage” is the generic name for the Spawn of Kyuss, which means this group is
serious bad news.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like ghosts conceptually - they’re classics for a reason. Mechanically,
though, these stat blocks leave a lot to be desired, as they seem to do much
less damage than could be explained even by the standard damage bug.</p>

<p>Maybe it has something to do with them being insubstantial? After all, this
makes them last twice as long in a fight as their HP would indicate. None of
them have any additional traits that make them especially vulnerable to a
specific type of damage, so their insubstantiality applies to everything. By the
time the Monster Vault had been published, insubstantial monsters took full
damage from force attacks, so you could say this applies to the MM ghosts as
well.</p>

<p>Gargoyles are based on sculptures found in many medieval buildings (particularly
churches). If I recall correctly, these statues depict horrible beasts and are
said to act as a sort of spiritual scarecrow, frightening demons away. They’re
usually known as <em>grotesques</em>, with <em>gargoyle</em> being a specific type of
grotesque that has a waterspout running through it to channel rainwater. It’s
“gargling”, you see.</p>

<p>D&amp;D gargoyles are a classic monster, part of the game since its beginnings. So
classic, in fact, that the real surprise here is when the demonic-looking
statues <em>aren’t</em> gargoyles in disguise. They appear in both books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Despite appearances, gargoyles aren’t animated statues, but living semi-organic
creatures who originated in the Elemental Chaos and spread to the world long
ago. As you’d expect, they’re ambush predators, and they’re also both sapient
and inclined to cruelty and sadism. They’re fond of “playing” with their prey
before eating it and don’t care if it’s sapient itself.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they can form cooperative relationships with other earth
creatures, and are sometimes employed by evil summoners or demon cultitsts who
bind them with magic. Gargoyles aren’t demons, but they look demonic enough and
are easier to bind!</p>

<p>The Monster Vault makes an interesting inversion by saying that in the world of
D&amp;D, the gargoyle’s reputation for cruelty has turned its image into a sign of
warning to intruders. This means that people in the setting have a reason to
sculpt gargoyles into their buildings! Ironically, the monsters end up
gravitating to these places since they provide such convenient camouflage.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As creatures of earth, gargoyles have Tremorsense 10 and an immunity to
petrification. They’re not immune to poison because they’re still
semi-organic. Gargoyles move pretty fast, with a ground speed of 6 and a flight
speed of 8. No hover capability, but they also can attack from the air with no
penalties. Gargoyles also have darkvision.</p>

<p>They’re all Medium Elemental Humanoids (Earth).</p>

<h3 id="gargoyle-both">Gargoyle (Both)</h3>

<p>The classic model is a Level 9 Lurker with 77 HP. It attacks with a claw that
suffers from the damage bug, and can use it as part of a Flyby Attack that
allows it to fly its speed without drawing opportunity attacks and make a claw
attack at any point in the movement. A hit here also knocks the target prone.</p>

<p>As expected the gargoyle can also assume a Stone Form, which gives it Resist 25
to all damage and Regeneration 3. In this form, it can only perceive its
surroundings via tremorsense, and can take no other actions other than to revert
to normal. Reverting is a minor action, meaning it can attack on the same turn
it does so.</p>

<p>The creature doesn’t do any additional damage from attacking from hiding,
meaning it’s another one of those MM lurkers who should have been a skirmisher.</p>

<p>The MV version is a proper lurker: though its basic attack does the same damage,
it now has a +20 bonus on its next damage roll after leaving Stone Form. It also
only has Tremorsense while in Stone Form, and its Flyby Attack ability (renamed
to Swoop Attack) only allows an attack at the end of the movement.</p>

<p>Instead of regenerating, the MV gargoyle gains 5 temporary HP at the start of
its turn. I don’t think this stacks, so it will never get rid of all its damage
during the fight. This is in line with late 4e’s policy of never giving its
monsters much in the way of healing abilities.</p>

<h3 id="gargoyle-rake-mv">Gargoyle Rake (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 5 Lurker with 52 HP that is essentially identical to its level 9
cousin, above. Its level-based stats are smaller, of course. Also, damage
resistance while in stone form is only 20, and the damage bonus is +15.</p>

<h3 id="gargoyle-rock-hurler-mv">Gargoyle Rock Hurler (MV)</h3>

<p>This one throws rocks! It’s Level 11 Artillery with 87 HP. The basic claw attack
is okay, and it can hurl rocks either one at a time (Ranged 20 vs. AC) or in a
volley (Area Bust 1 Within 10 vs. AC; half damage on a miss).</p>

<p>The rock hurler can’t create its own ammunition, but it’s likely to be found in
a place with plenty of loose stone lying around anyway.</p>

<p>It can’t turn into a statue completely, but its stony hide gives it Resist 10 to
damage from ranged attacks originating from more than 5 squares away.</p>

<h3 id="nabassu-gargoyle-both">Nabassu Gargoyle (Both)</h3>

<p>While still not classed as a demon, this Level 18 Lurker is a lot closer to
being one than its weaker cousins. It has 131 HP and all standard gargoyle
traits.</p>

<p>Its abilities are a basic claw, a non-basic bite that does a bit more damage,
and a stronger version of Stone Form. Instead of getting a bonus to its next
damage roll when leaving Stone Form, the nabassu gargoyle automatically does a
chunk of fire and necrotic damage to every enemy within 3 squares of it.</p>

<p>While in stone form it also emits a Bloodfire curse (aura 3) that deals 10 fire
and necrotic damage to any enemy that ends its turn in range. When this happens,
the monster gains 10 temporary HP.</p>

<p>A useful note: “10 fire and necrotic damage” means 10 damage of the “fire and
necrotic” type, not “10 fire and 10 necrotic”. This means you resist it with the
lower of your fire and necrotic resistance - if you have Resist 15 to fire but 0
to necrotic, you take the full 10 damage.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual version is a bit clunkier. Its Stone Form functions exactly
like that of the MM classic model, and its bite heals it for half its rolled
damage on a hit. Bloodfire is an Aura 2 that does 5 damage and weakens enemies
who already are taking ongoing damage, and only works <em>out</em> of Stone Form.</p>

<p>Just use the MV version, it’s better.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter from the MM is level 9: 3 gargoyles, 2 galeb duhr
earthbreakers, and 1 gibbering mouther. It’s essentially another version of the
similar galeb duhr/gargoyle/bullete encounter we already saw, with a different
interloper.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault gargoyles are generally superior to the MM ones when it comes
to mechanics, and you lose nothing by ignoring the Monster Manual on this
one. Lore-wise, I feel gargoyles are one of those monsters so classic that you
almost <em>have</em> to feature them in your campaign at some point. The big subversion
here would be a campaign where every statue was exactly what it seemed.</p>

<p>The Galeb Duhr apears in the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition monster manual, and I believe in
supplements for earlier editions, as this boulder-shaped creature that mostly
just likes to hang out in rocky places. In Fourth Edition they get a slightly
more humanoid appearance and some additional backstory. They appear only on the
Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Like the Azers, Galeb Duhrs were originally dwarves who failed to escape the
yoke of the giants, and who were mutated through the ensuing eons of
servitude. Unlike the Azers, they’re aspected to Earth, and so look like people
made out of rock.</p>

<p>Today, many Galeb Duhrs are free and live in the world, where I suspect they’d
behave much like the ones from AD&amp;D. Still, many of them are still subservient
to the earth giants both in the world and back in the Elemental Chaos, which
makes them potential opponents to PCs. Even free galeb duhrs might end up
fighting you if you anger them, of course, and as beings of earth they’re very
hard to calm down once angry.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Galeb Duhrs have a few signature traits, starting with Tremorsense 10. As
creatures of earth, they’re immune to petrification and poison. Their ponderous
steps carry them at speed 4, but they can burrow at speed 6. They’re Medium
Elemental Humanoids with the Earth keyword.</p>

<p>Power-wise, galeb duhrs are pretty much earthbenders. Earlier editions gave them
all sorts of earth-based spells, and these ones have powers that manipulate soil
and rocks in ways that fit their roles.</p>

<h3 id="galeb-duhr-earthbreaker">Galeb Duhr Earthbreaker</h3>

<p>The earthbreaker is Level 8 Artillery with 73 HP. Its basic attack is a
<strong>slam</strong>, but it will mostly <strong>Hurl Stones</strong> (Area Burst 1 Within 10 vs. AC),
which deals a bit of physical damage and makes the affected area difficult
terrain. There’s an explicit note in the power saying that the creature can
create its own ammunition if none happens to be available in the surrounding
area.</p>

<p>If someone gets too close, the earthbreaker can cause a <strong>Shock Wave</strong> (Close
Burst 2 vs. Fortitude; Recharge 5-6) that does a bit of damage, pushes 1 square,
and knocks prone.</p>

<p>Damage from Hurl Stones is actually about right for a level 8 area attack; the
others need to be increased a bit.</p>

<h3 id="galeb-duhr-rockcaller">Galeb Duhr Rockcaller</h3>

<p>This Level 11 Controller has 118 HP. Its <strong>slam</strong> is a little beefier, and it
can also use a <strong>Rolling Attack</strong> which works as a charge that targets
Fortitude, pushing the target 1 square and knocking them prone in addition to
doing slam damage.</p>

<p>The rockcaller can also use <strong>Earthen Grasp</strong> against a target who is touching
the ground (Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude). This does no damage but restrains (save
ends) on a hit. Only one creature can be so restrained at a time.</p>

<p>As an at-will minor action, the Rockcaller can also turn 4 earth or stone
squares inside a Close Burst 10 into difficult terrain. These don’t need to be
contiguous! Unless you’re fighting over a frozen lake or atop a solid cloud, the
whole battlefield will become difficult terrain given enough time.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is level 11: 1 rockcaller, 4 gargoyles, and 1 bulette. The
bulette is surely there as a surprise interloper who will go for the combatants
most obviously made of meat: the PCs.</p>

<p>You are also likely to find galeb duhr in earth giant strongholds, as slaves and
guards. Like the azer, they’d be the first line of defense against invaders,
covering those entry points too small to fit a giant. Also like azer, you might
be able to persuade them to rebel.</p>

<p>I like galeb duhrs, and their shared origin with the azers and dwarves. It’s
still perfectly possible to have interactions with them that resemble the ones
you’d have with their 2e counterparts, but the added backstory gives you more
hooks from which to hang your plots. Their culture is less complex and
craft-based than that of the azers, but then again so is that of their giant
masters.</p>
