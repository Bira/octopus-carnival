<p>Basilisks are another traditional D&amp;D monster that’s been around since at least
the days of Basic. Here they’re Large natural beasts, in the form of beefy grey
eight-legged lizards with copious spines running down their backs. Basilisks
appear in both the Monster Manual and the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual is surprisingly spare on basilisk lore. It says here they’re
strangely evolved drakes that use their deadly gazes to hunt for food. The same
gaze makes them highly feared. It <em>is</em> possible to tame and train them, though,
like other members of the drake family.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault is a lot more poetic about it. Most people know very little
about basilisks because most civilians who meet one don’t survive to tell the
tale. The beast isn’t malicious and doesn’t actively seek out sapient prey, but
it will literally kill you as soon as it looks at you. If a settlement begins to
have trouble with people going into the woods and disappearing, it could be
because a basilisk made its lair nearby.</p>

<p>Well, that’s nice and atmospheric and all, but this is D&amp;D. “People have been
going missing in the woods” doesn’t really narrow it down at all. There are
dozens of monsters that could be responsible for it.</p>

<p>Anyway, there are several separate varieties of basilisk, each with a different
(but still unpleasant) gaze. Some are solitary, some are pack hunters. They’re a
rare case of a fantastic animal that originated in the world and managed to
spread to the Feywild, so you can find them there as well.</p>

<p>People who manage to tame a basilisk usually employ it as a guard animal in an
area where no other allies are present. Well, no allies that are not expendable
or immune to the gaze. Common basilisk tamers include demons, who keep them as
pets or use them as muscle in incursions to the world.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The signature trait of all basilisks is of course the gaze, which is an area
attack whose effect varies by specific monster.</p>

<p>The <strong>Venom-Eye Basilisk</strong> is level 10 artillery and has 87 HP and Speed 6. It’s
AC is surprisingly tough for a monster of its role and level (27 in the MM, 24
in the MV), and its Fortitude is only slightly less beefy. Its other defenses
are average.</p>

<p>Its bite is relatively weak, and its gaze does poison damage plus ongoing 5
poison damage on a hit. Anyone taking ongoing damage from this gaze also causes
2 poison damage to anyone next to them. Hit or miss, the gaze attack also causes
targets to take a -2 penalty to their attacks for a turn.</p>

<p>The MM version is completely immune to poison, while the MV version has poison
resistance 5. I get the idea behind the immunity - they want the basilisk to be
immune to its own gaze, which is vital if you want to make them pack hunters. I
<em>think</em> that’s still supposed to be the case in the MV versions, but you could
still hit it with different poisons and have those be effective if they’re
strong enough.</p>

<p>The <strong>Stone-Eye Basilisk</strong> is the classic model, called only a <strong>Basilisk</strong> in
the Monster Vault. The MM version is a level 12 soldier and the MV version a
level 12 controller. Both have 126 HP and similar traits aside from that.</p>

<p>This basilisk is of course immune to petrification, and has a Baleful Gaze that
slows for a turn anyone within 5 squares that attacks the basilisk. That’s
automatic, no attack roll involved. Closing your eyes won’t prevent this either,
since it happens when <em>it</em> sees <em>you</em>. The actual gaze <em>attack</em> is a close blast
3, and it sets off a chain reaction: Slowed -&gt; Immobilized -&gt; Petrified, with
the condition worsening on each failed save. I believe this model of gradually
worsening conditions was one of 4e’s big mechanical innovations. In previous
edition, attacks like these would just be save-or-die; now you have time to
panic.</p>

<p>The basilisk also has a strong bite, which the lore specifically notes makes it
capable of eating creatures petrified by its gaze.</p>

<p>These first two are actually two versions of the basilisk legend! In some
stories it would turn you to stone, in others it just kills you.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault has two additional basilisk varietals: the <strong>wilt-eye</strong> is a
level 11 controller with 117 HP, with a gentler gaze that gives you a penalty to
your attacks and knocks you out on the first failed save.</p>

<p>And then there’s the <strong>Abyssal Basilisk</strong> who is a Chaotic Evil elemental beast
instead of natural and unaligned. This is the one demons raise in the
Abyss. It’s level 13 artillery, and its gaze drives one mad with horror. The
chain goes: 10 ongoing psychic damage -&gt; make a basic attack against your
closest ally -&gt; 10 ongoing psychic damage <em>and</em> you’re dominated.</p>

<p>The suggested encounters in the MM are a level 11 against 2 venom-eyes and 2
mezzodemons, and a level 12 against 2 stone-eyes, a fey choker, and a dryad
witch. The mezzodemons aren’t bothered by the poison gaze, but the fey duo are
<em>not</em> immune to petrification, so they should watch their positioning.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>What can I say? It’s a classic for a reason, and even the MV didn’t see fit to
change its workings other than fixing the damage). I did like the addition of
the wilt-eye basilisk - that’s an encounter a commoner could actually survive! I
mean, if basilisks behave like normal wild animals, then they’re rarely
people-eaters. They’d be killing people either by accident (can’t stop the gaze)
or in self-defense. A wilt-eye would just knock the commoner out and leave.</p>

<p>That goes for the natural versions, of course. The Abyssal one has been turned
into a standard attack-on-sight-fight-to-the-death monster by the hard work of
generations of demon breeders.</p>

<p>This is another entry in my Let’s Read of the Monster Manual and Monster Vault
for D&amp;D Fourth Edition. You can see the rest of them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>A Banshrae is a Medium fey humanoid that looks like the love child of an elf and
a praying mantis. Tall and rail-thin, they have alabaster skin, long clawed
fingers and triangular mouthless faces with insectile eyes. They’re originally
from Third Edition’s Monster Manual V, and here they’re only on the Monster
Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Banshraes are Unaligned, and the ones we see in this entry have an Int of 14 and
a Charisma of 20. Nevertheless, the text repeatedly describes them as cold,
sinister and egotistical, with a tendency to view other sapients as sources of
amusement or loot rather than as people. The nicest among them are pranking
tricksters, and the bad apples are sadistic serial killers. I guess you don’t
need to officially swear allegiance to the cosmic principle of Evil to be an
asshole.</p>

<p>Having no mouth, banshraes communicate via telepathy. I guess they either don’t
need food at all or feed on someting like ambient magic. One interesting factoid
is that banshraes love singing and the sound of wind instruments, despite having
no way to sing or play themselves. Stories speak of people who managed to avoid
being pranked/murdered by a banshrae by singing or playing tunes to it.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Banshraes have speed 8 and low-light vision. Their other signature trait is
actually a piece of signature gear: a blowgun and darts, which they can use
despite having no mouth. I picture them doing a fancy palm strike on one end of
the blowgun to fire a dart out of the other.</p>

<p>The <strong>Banshrae Dartswarmer</strong> is level 11 artillery with 89 HP, who fights
unarmed in melee but whose specialty is firing poisoned blowgun darts that do
damage, daze and inflict a penalty to attacks. Every so often (recharge 3-6)
then can go “full auto” and fire a dart flurry with the same effect at anyone in
a close blast 5. That basically hits the entire PC party unless they’re <em>very</em>
spread out.</p>

<p>The <strong>Banshrae Warrior</strong> is a level 12 skirmisher with 121 HP who can also use a
blowgun but who focuses on its praying mantis kung-fu. It can shift 1 square as
a minor action after hitting with a melee attack, and it has two of those: a
basic slam, and the Staggering Palm. Staggering Palm does damage and stuns the
target for a turn, but only recharges after the banshrae uses Mantid Dance.</p>

<p>Mantid Dance is a move action, and lasts a turn. While in effect, it gives the
banshrae warrior +2 to all defenses (okay) and makes <em>all ranged attacks
automatically miss it</em> (jeepers creepers!). Oh, and they do increased damage if
they move far enough during their turn. Having good defenders and solid melee
strikers is a must when fighting these fey.</p>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 12: 2 dartswarmers, 1 warrior, 1 ettin
spirit-talker and 1 iron gorgon (of the bull-looking kind). I’m guessing these
aren’t the “nice” banshraes.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I don’t think I’m entirely sold on the “heartless serial killer” presentation,
but the mechanics inspire me to do a Five Venoms kung-fu storyline with a
banshrae dojo as the villains. You could also tone the serial killer thing down
and present them as more cruel pranksters who aren’t necessarily out for blood.</p>

<p>The first of the Bs! The Balhannoth is a Large Aberrant Magical Beast
(blind). “Blind” here is a keyword with some rules attached: blind creatures
cannot be blinded (obviously!) and are immune to gaze attacks and other effects
that rely on sight. They rely on special senses such as blindsight or
tremorsense, but can’t make Perception checks beyond the range of these
senses. I’d interpret that to mean they can’t make <em>visual</em> Perception checks.</p>

<p>A level 13 elite lurker, the Balhannoth has a slug-like body that menaces with
spikes, five clawed tentacles, and a huge eyeless maw for a face. I’m told they
first appeared in the Monster Manual IV for 3.5, but this is my first personal
contact with them. They’re only on the Monster Manual and have no Vault version.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>There isn’t much here. Balhannoths are indiscriminate ambush predators who live
in the Underdark. Barely sapient at Int 3, they understand Deep Speech and are
Chaotic Evil. Balhannoths might tail their chosen prey for hours, waiting for
the best moment to strike.</p>

<p>The evil worm-things rarely associate with others of their own species (except
perhaps to reproduce), but sometimes they can be trained to obey commands by
other sapients. Telepathic creatures have an easier time of it and can “tame”
captured adults. Non-telepathic trainers must train a balhannoth from birth if
they are to have any hope of success.</p>

<p>In short, they’re pretty much tailor-made mind flayer pets, and would likely be
used like guard dogs and advance forces during a raid. The flayers get the
brains, the balhannoths get the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Being blind, balhannoths are immune to gaze attacks and illusions and have
Blindsight 10 from ESP. They’re relatively slow at Speed 4, but with spider
climb they can pretty much move in three dimensions inside the Underdark. Their
main mode of movement, though, is the Reality Shift, a type of teleportation
that twists the surrounding space and has a 10 square range.</p>

<p>When balhannoths teleport, anyone standing next to them at the point of
departure is dazed, and anyone next to them at the point of arrival grants
combat advantage for a turn. They attack with tentacles, and can whip those
tentacles around to hit everyone on a Close Burst 3 around them and slide anyone
their hit freely within this area of effect. They also do increased damage
against targets granting CA and can become invisible at will.</p>

<p>So yeah, this is how they hunt. They’ll sense you through walls using
blindsense, teleport to the middle of the party while invisible, and use
Tentacle Whip to hurt everyone and ruin your marching order. Then they’ll
teleport away and do it again.</p>

<p>The suggested encounters are level 13: 1 balhannoth and 3 grimlock berserkers,
or 1 balhannoth and four kuo-toa. The first are likely all servants of a mind
flayer, the others had to train their pet ninja slug the hard way.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>There’s not much there lore-wise, but I found the mechanics pretty cool. The
concept of a teleporting ninja slug has a certain something to it. Level them up
to 17 and they’d make good aboleth pets too.</p>

<p>To close out the As, we have another classic, the Azer. I remember them from D&amp;D
3.5 as basically dwarves that are on fire. Here we get a tiny bit more
background tying them to the Fourth edition cosmology.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Way back at the dawn of time, dwarves were all slaves to the giants. Eventually
they rebelled against their masters and escaped into the world, where they would
proceed to build their own civilization. Well, most of them did.</p>

<p>Those that stayed behind were mutated by fire giants and transformed into
azer. Some of those broke free later, but some remain enslaved as laborers and
guards. So if you’re raiding the castle of the fire giant king, you’re going to
run into troops of azer before you start seeing giants. They’re Unaligned and
about as intelligent as regular dwarves, so you might be able to negotiate with
them and foment rebellion.</p>

<p>Azer don’t have a Monster Vault counterpart.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As inhabitants of the Elemental Chaos, 4e Azer are paragon-tier opponents. We
get several stat blocks for them here. The signature Azer traits are Resist Fire
30 and Warding Flame: each enemy that starts their turn adjacent to 2 or more
azer takes 5 fire damage. They are <em>not</em> particularly vulnerable to cold.</p>

<p>The <strong>Azer Warrior</strong> is a Level 17 Minion, useful for padding out encounters
involving fire giants or azer regulars. They attack with warhammers that do fire
damage and a tiny bit of ongoing fire damage.</p>

<p>The <strong>Azer Foot Soldier</strong> is a regular version of the warrior, a Level 14
Soldier with 141 HP. his equipment and attack (singular) are pretty much
identical to the Warrior’s, aside from having normal rolled damage for their
level.</p>

<p>The <strong>Azer Rager</strong> is a totally metal Level 15 Brute who has 181 HP. She attacks
with gauntlets that menace with spikes of fire (and cause ongoing fire
damage). When bloodied, she can call upon Chains of Flame, which cause fire
damage in a Close Burst 5 around her and immobilize enemies who were already on
fire from other attacks.</p>

<p>The <strong>Azer Taskmaster</strong> is a Level 17 Controller (Leader) attacks with a scourge
that menaces with spikes of fire (and does a mix of physical and fire
damage). Once per turn it can cause a nearby enemy who just took fire damage
from any source to also take ongoing fire damage. This guy is probably an
exception to the negotiation bit - he likely gets special privileges in exchange
for keeping the other azer in line.</p>

<p>The <strong>Azer Beastlord</strong> is a Level 17 Soldier (Leader) or, in other words, a
hellhound wrangler. His basic attack is a battleaxe that mixes physical and fire
damage, and marks on a hit. The real attraction here are his other powers,
though. He can make an allied elemental beast recharge one of its encounter or
daily powers as an <em>at-will</em> minor action, and once per encounter he can hand
out a free attack to every allied elemental beast who can see him and is
flanking an enemy.</p>

<p>The suggested encounters are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: One pair of azer footsoldiers and one pair of salamanders. These
poor sods escaped the fire giants only to be enslaved by salamanders.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 6 warriors, 2 ragers, and one immolith demon. <em>These</em> poor sods have
it even worse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: One taskmaster, one beastlord, 8 warriors and 1 firebred
hellhound. These could be free azer! You should totally swap the warriors for
another 2 hellhounds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Dwarves on fire! The foot soldier is a bag of HP with a single melee attack, so
it’s quite boring on its own. The others are a bit more interesting, though I
feel like the taskmaster should have a ranged attack of some sort. In fact, the
azer lineup in this book is very lacking in ranged firepower, so they need some
external artillery support. They also suffer from the classic “fire monster in a
fire dungeon” problem, where any smart party will prepare themselves to resist
much of their damage.</p>

<p>The most fun of the lot is definitely the Beastlord, particularly when
associated with a pack of hellhounds or even other, <em>non-fire</em> elemental
beasts.</p>

<p>If your previous exposure to Azer was the low-level stat block in the 3.x
monster manual, seeing them as mid-to-late paragon tier creatures might be a bit
jarring. Their abilities are simple enough that you could comfortably reduce
their level by 10 or so to make them appropriate for heroic tier games without
changing what they do in combat.</p>
