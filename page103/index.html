            <p>Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder’s Iconic Characters to
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy!</strong> This is the fifth post in the series. Previous
entries can be found here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/02/pathfinder-df-barbarian.html">Amiri the Barbarian</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/08/pathfinder-df-bard.html">Lem the Bard</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/23/pathfinder-df-druid.html">Lini the Druid</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Today’s template is the Holy Warrior, which means that today’s character is
Seelah. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Seelah.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Cool, huh? She’s my second favorite design so far, losing only to Kyra (Lini is
a close third). Her <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Seelah">bio</a>, however, is by far the best. It’s quite tragic,
but seems to hit a good balance between “biblical” and “Arthurian”. Her official
stats are <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/seelah.html">here</a>. From these we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Seelah is a paladin of Iomedae the Inheritor, a Lawful Good deity of justice
and protection. She wears heavy armor and fights with sword and shield, with a
bow kept in reserve.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She has the usual varied suite of paladin powers, the ones most emphasized are
her fearlessness, her ability to smite evil, and her healing hands, in that
order.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While Seelah goes after all manner of evil foes, she fights fiends and evil
dragons with particular fervor.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Given Iomedae’s description as the goddess of justice and valor, the default
Holy Warrior package should suit her just fine. The end result doesn’t quite
have the points to afford all the standard paladin abilities - healing is
expensive! However, the GURPS version of Seelah is absolutely fearless,
supernaturally resistant to disease, can channel divine might to enhance her
strength, and is particularly adept at fighting demons. All that as a starting
DF character! Buying the Faith Healing ability with earned character points
should be next on her list.</p>

            <p>Welcome to our second Blog or Treat article! I wanted to do another scary
monster during this week, and figured there was no reason think small. So in
this post we’ll stat up Death.</p>

<h2 id="the-horror-of-death">The Horror of Death</h2>

<p>In the previous article we launched right into the stats of
the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/24/snake-maned-lion.html">Snake-Maned Lion</a>, but here let’s look at the historical and narrative
concepts around the Grim Reaper first.</p>

<p>According to the ever-helpful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(personification)">Wikipedia</a>, many cultures and mythologies
describe different personifications of death. It’s not considered a bad thing in
all of them, which results in the messenger of death looking more like an angel
who merely takes the departed to the afterlife. However, the version we’re
interested in is the black-robed skeleton with the scythe, an invention of
14th-century Europe. The name “Grim Reaper” is more recent, having been first
recorded in 1847.</p>

<p>The mention of “14th-century Europe” might ring a bell. Indeed, that’s when the
Black Death swept through the continent. It’s not a stretch to think that the
skeleton-and-scythe imagery comes from it. It’s as much a personification of the
<em>fear of death</em> as it is of death itself. The Reaper does not symbolize death as
part of a cycle, or a gentle passing into some higher realm. A scythe is not a
tool for gently picking individual wheat stalks. No, the Grim Reaper is the
Death that does to humanity what a farmer does to a field come harvest
time. It’s the Death that takes away your loved ones in the prime of their lives
and then comes for you. You have as much defense against it as wheat does
against the farmer.</p>

<p>The monster and its variants statted up below draw inspiration from this
imagery, and from a couple of other similar creatures I’ve run across in other
games. It’s appropriate for Dungeon Fantasy or horror campaigns, being a much
scarier threat in the latter.</p>

<h2 id="grim-reaper">Grim Reaper</h2>

<p>Long thought just a legend or a metaphor for death, these beings turn out to be
quite real. Most of what is known of them is pure speculation, as almost no one
who got into a position to take a good look at them survived the encounter. Are
they a form of spectral undead? A demon? Are they a <em>species</em> of monster, or is
there just the one avatar of Death itself?</p>

<p>It is known that Grim Reapers are floating figures wearing voluminous, tattered
black robes and wielding large scythes. Beyond that, accounts vary. Some say
they look skeletal, others see a demonic horned visage, and others report only
darkness staring at them from beneath the hood. Some report it carring a lantern
in addition to the scythe.</p>

<p>One of the reasons it’s so hard to get a precise account of how their look is
that these creatures inhabit a place between life and death. They are normally
completely invisible to mortal eyes, and intangible to anything physical! They
attack by reaching through this veil and pulling unwary mortals through. The
closer they are to the reaper’s in-between home, the more than can interact with
it… and once they are close enough, the monster cuts them down with its
absurdly sharp scythe.</p>

<p>No one has encountered more than one Grim Reaper at once… but they tend to
hang out in places soaked in plague and/or evil, much
like <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/24/snake-maned-lion.html">Snake-Maned Lions</a> and other similar monsters, so it wouldn’t be
implausible to encounter it alongside these other creatures.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 18; <strong>DX</strong> 14; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong>: 10; <strong>Parry</strong>: 14; <strong>DR</strong>: 4; <strong>SM</strong> 0</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 18; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong>: 12; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong> 7.5; <strong>Move</strong> 7</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pull Through the Veil</strong> (16): 1 point toxic, and the target becomes marked
by the Reaper (see Notes, below). Reach C, 1. This is a <em>Cosmic</em> attack that
ignores DR, and affects substantial targets.</li>
  <li><strong>Grim Scythe</strong> (18): 3d+3 cut <em>or</em> 3d+1 imp <em>or</em> 1d+1 cut
(Hook). Reach 1. Often done as a Deceptive Attack. This is a <em>Cosmic</em> attack
that ignores DR! See Notes, below, for which targets are valid.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Astral Entity (p. <strong>B263</strong>); Dark Vision (with Color Vision);
Fragile (Unnatural); Flight (max Move 7); Enhanced Parry 2 (Scythe);
Indomitable; Immunity to Mind Control; Injury Tolerance (No Blood, No Brain, No
Vitals, Unliving); Skinny; Temperature Tolerance 10; Unfazeable; Vaccum Support.</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Brawling-16; Two-Handed Axe/Mace-18; Observation-12;</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Undead.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: When a target first becomes <em>marked by the Reaper</em>, they begin
perceiving their surroundings as blurry and colorless (-1 to Per-based rolls to
make out detail). Characters who have been marked once can see the Reaper in
full detail; they can attack it for half damage, and <em>it</em> can attack <em>them</em> for
half damage as well. Twice-Marked characters can interact with the Reaper as if
it was fully substantial and vice-versa.</p>

<p>These marks fade after a minute, returning the character to normal. The scythe
disappears when the creature is slain.</p>

<h3 id="fighting-the-grim-reaper">Fighting the Grim Reaper</h3>

<p>The Reaper attacks by invisibly approaching the most vulnerable-looking party
member, marking them twice, and cutting them down. Its touch grants it the
ability to isolate vulnerable adventurers without having to rely on terrain, as
it remains invisible and insubstantial to the victim’s friends. It makes free
use of tactics such as Deceptive, Defensive, Committed or All-Out Attacks to
exploit holes in its opponent’s defenses.</p>

<p>To effectively fight a Reaper, the PCs should have access to magic that allows
them to see and affect invisible and insubstantial creatures. Being undead, it’s
also vulnerable to some Cleric and Holy Warrior powers. Lacking either of those,
they might contrive to get marked by the monster and fight it that way, though
that’s pretty risky as it’s a superb melee combatant. Its multiple injury
tolerances and high HT mean it might only die when it hits -36 HP, and it’s
smart enough to fly away and try again when the marks have worn off.</p>

<p>Even a single Grim Reaper can pose a significant challenge to a whole delver
party.</p>

<h3 id="variant-reapers">Variant Reapers</h3>

<p>Plenty of variance is possible here by changing the answers to the questions at
the beginning of the monster’s description.</p>

<p><em>Different Class</em>: This variant is not undead, but is either a Demon or a Divine
Servitor. This either makes it vulnerable to a <em>different</em> set of Holy powers,
or not particularly vulnerable to any of them.</p>

<p><em>Greater</em>: This large variant carries an oversized scythe. It might well be
<em>the</em> Grim Reaper! Change ST and HP to 27; change SM to +1; change scythe damage
to 5d+5 cutting <em>or</em> 5d+2 imp <em>or</em> 3d-2 cutting (Hook); change scythe range to
1-2.</p>

<p><em>Lantern-Bearing</em>: This variant carries a skull-shaped lantern in addition to
its scythe. The lantern can cast Mass Sleep at power 15 and has a 30-point
Energy Reserve. Particularly cruel GMs can have the Mass Sleep be cast at power
20 instead. The lantern also disappears if the creature is slain.</p>

<p><em>Materialized</em>: While still a spirit, this variant exists closer to the world of
the living than to the world of the dead. It’s visible and almost solid, but
still difficult to hurt. Remove Astral Entity and the Pull Through the Veil
attack and replace Injury Tolerance (Unliving) with Injury Tolerance (Diffuse).</p>

<p>Incidentally, one of the inspirations for this monster is Dragon’s Dogma, which
features a Greater, Materialized, Lantern-Bearing Grim Reaper in its most
dangerous dungeon.</p>

            <p>Welcome to Blog or Treat, a Halloween Special conspiracy concocted by a
secretive cabal of GURPS bloggers. Here at Octopus Carnival, I will present to
you two particularly scary monsters! One you see below, the other will grace
your screen tomorrow.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="the-snake-maned-lion">The Snake-Maned Lion</h2>

<p>This horrible beast is a nightmare made flesh, a huge lion with a dozen venomous
snakes growing out of its black mane. Some sages proclaim it comes from the
darkest faerie realms, while others ascribe an infernal origin to it. What they
do agree on is that he creature makes its home in places haunted by evil. It
hunts at night, drawn to the scent of fresh blood, the cries of small and
helpless things, or any light sources.</p>

<p>The snake-maned lion possesses animal intelligence, but it’s clever enough to
adapt its tactics to the strength of its potential prey. When faced with a weak
or helpless victim, it delights in striding boldly into view and letting out an
intimidating roar followed by a frontal attack. When faced with a group of more
capable opposition, it will attempt to strike from ambush, targetting isolated
stragglers and using its roar to drive others away before dragging its victim
off. In either case, it prefers to attack by biting and hanging on, letting the
snakes finish the job and helping them along with its claws.</p>

<p>The monster is solitary in that it’s rarely seen together with others of its
kind, but its choice of hunting ground means it’s often encountered alongside a
group of undead or demonic creatures. It seems to have a natural tendency to
leave these monster types alone, and they in turn don’t bother it. Sometimes, a
more powerful villain such as a lich, dark fey lord, or demon will manage to
tame one of these beasts.</p>

  <li><strong>Serpent Mane (18) (x4)</strong>: 2 points impaling + follow-up 1d toxic (HT-1, plus
-1 per additional bite, to resist; 5 cycles; 1 minute per cycle). Often aimed
at the face (-5) or neck (-5) if those are unarmored.</li>

aimed at the torso, followed by four Serpent Mane attacks aimed at the
grappled target’s torso, face or head.</li>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Combat Reflexes; Extra Attack 4 (Serpent Mane only);
Fearlessness 5; Night Vision 7; Penetrating Voice; Quadruped; Restricted Diet
(Fresh Meat); Sadism (9); Wild Animal; Terror 2 (Roar).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Brawling-15; Stealth-15; Wrestling-15;</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Hybrid.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Animal spells which affect hybrids work on the lion.</p>

<h3 id="fighting-the-snake-maned-lion">Fighting the Snake-Maned Lion</h3>

<p>As you can see from its stats, getting into melee combat with the snake-maned
lion is a very bad idea. Through a combination of high skill, Rapid Strikes and
Extra Attacks it has a very good chance of damaging its chosen victim at least
once per turn.</p>

<p>The beast should be fought at a distance, with ranged weapons or magic. Of
course, it will try its hardest to force a melee confrontation by sneaking in
close before its initial pounce, and it might disrupt the efforts of any ranged
attackers with its roar. If keeping away is not an option, distracting it with
numbers and flanking it is the next best bet.</p>

<p>The sound of the lion’s roar is audible over a mile away, so unless the PCs take
precautions like plugging their ears in advance, they <em>will</em> be inside its area
of effect at the ranges in which the monster likes to use it.</p>

<h3 id="variant-lions">Variant Lions</h3>

<p>The Snake-Maned Lion has some similarities to mythological beasts such as the
Chimera or the Manticore, and might fulfill similar narrative roles. According
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology)">this Wikipedia article on the Chimera</a>, chimerical figures appear in
medieval art as deceptive or even satanic embodiments or raw nature.</p>

<p>The base creature above is well-suited to this, but if you don’t think it’s
scary enough you can try these variants:</p>

<p><em>Armored</em>: This variant is covered in reptilian scales instead of leonine
hide. Raise DR to 4 and remove the Tough Skin limitation.</p>

<p><em>Intelligent</em>: This variant is smart enough to understand speech and come up
with really clever ambush setups. It’s also no longer affected by Animal spells,
requiring Mind Control magic instead. Raise IQ to 8, Will to 12, and remove Wild
Animal.</p>

<p><em>Demonic</em>: A materialized spirit from hell set loose in our plane! Change its
class to Demon and add Injury Tolerance (Homogenous), which makes it a lot more
resistant to most ranged weapons.</p>

<p>These variants can stack with each other and with any of the generic monster
prefixes from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 1</strong>.</p>

            <p><strong>Update</strong>: This is the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy version of the character. If you
want to see a version for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG, click <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/10/10/pathfinder-dfrpg-druid.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder’s Iconic Characters to
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy!</strong> This is the fourth post in the series. Previous
entriers can be found here:</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Druid, which means today’s star is Lini. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Lini.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can find her full bio <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Lini">here</a>, and her original Pathfinder
stats <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/lini.html">here</a>. From looking at these, we see the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lini is a Golarion gnome, which is different from the Dungeon Fantasy gnome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is a druid and hails from the Land of the Linnorm Kings, home of the
Not-Vikings. She was always good with animals, and left the place shortly
after meeting her snow leopard animal companion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wields a sickle and a sling, but prefers to send her animal companion to
fight for her. Her magic is more or less even mix of terrain-affecting,
support and attack spells. She is also described as having a knack for
handling animals, particularly large mammals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Template-wise, the default <strong>Druid</strong> will be appropriate here, as Pathfinder
druids draw their power directly from nature. The biggest difficulty will be
Lini’s racial template, as gnomes from Golarion (Pathfinder’s setting) are
different from those presented in DF. So the first order of business here is
creating a racial template for the Golarion Gnome.</p>

<p>From the point of view of Dungeon Fantasy, the gnomes of Golarion are more like
slightly larger leprechauns than the gadget-oriented folk you see in
DF 3. They’re about the size of halflings, and while the original system does
give them a small bonus to crafting skills, their innate magic and faerie
heritage are more emphasized. I also want to keep the template cost at or under
20 points, since that’s what DF gnomes cost. Putting all of that together we
have something like this:</p>

<h2 id="golarion-gnomes-0-points">Golarion Gnomes (0 points)</h2>

<p><strong>Attribute Modifiers</strong>: ST-3 {-30}; HT+2 {20}.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Characteristic Modifiers</strong>: SM -2; HP+1 {2}; Will+1 {5}; Per +1 {5};

<p>And now that we have all we need, here’s today’s character! Her spell repertoire
is a bit lighter on direct buffs than in Pathfinder, but still strikes the same
balance.</p>

<p>After covering occupational templates in some detail, it’s time to look at
racial templates. What options do players have for creating non-human
characters?</p>

<p>The default answer is “not many”. The original game started out with a more
traditional fantasy setting containing all the races you’d expect, but was
eventually developed into the setting we see when playing it. <em>Humans</em> make up
the bulk of civilization in Gransys and the rest of the world. A minority of
alien <em>Pawns</em> are the only non-humans who are also part of it.</p>

<p>There are other non-human sapients around: <em>Goblins</em> and their <em>Hobgoblin</em>
cousins clearly have a civilization of sorts, and the various species of
<em>Saurian</em> (humanoid lizards) are fairly sophisticated tool-users. However, their
views of humanity run between “fun to torment” and “tasty”, with humans holding
an equivalent low opinion off them. Peaceful interaction between these species
is vanishingly rare. Other sapient monsters (such as the <em>Harpy</em> and <em>Dragon</em>
families) are even less appropriate as player characters! These will all be
covered when we get to the monsters.</p>

<p>Below you will find two racial lenses for the Arisen and the Pawns. These can be
used as-is in the Dragon’s Dogma setting presented in this blog, or in a more
traditional DF setting if the GM is willing to bring in the cosmic baggage that
comes with them. In those settings, the lenses can be applied to members of any
playable race, giving you characters such as elven Arisen or halfling Pawns.</p>

<p>But first, let’s briefly discuss a setting element tied to both of these lenses:</p>

<h2 id="setting-element-the-rift">Setting Element: The Rift</h2>

<p>The world of Dragon’s Dogma is touched by the Rift, an interstitial realm that
appears as a dimly lit, fog-covered plain. The Rift connects multiple worlds,
and is the original home of the Pawns. The Dragon comes from somewhere beyond
it. The points where it touches the world are marked by <em>Riftstones</em>, and the
Arisen can use those to interact with the Rift.</p>

<p>We’ll reveal much more about it in future posts, but for now it’s enough to know
that the existence of the two racial lenses shown below in a setting also
implies that it’s touched by the Rift and contains Riftstones. GMs using
different settings that already possess similar “planar travel” elements might
want to use those instead, or to integrate the Rift with them.</p>

<h2 id="the-arisen-10-points">The Arisen (10 points)</h2>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/arisen-party.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>Copyright 2013 Capcom</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Arisen are those who dare stand against the Dragon when it first enters the
world. For this, they are marked in a mystical ritual where the Dragon consumes
their heart. The stolen heart still beats within the beast, and so the victim
rises again compelled to confront it once more.</p>

<p>Having no heart, the Arisen also have no pulse or heartbeat. The ritual also
leaves a very large and distinctive scar in their chests, which is the same
shape for all of them. This scar can be covered up fairly easily, but it
sometimes glows through any clothing or armor when in proximity to a Pawn or a
draconic being. The Arisen also have the ability to interact with the Rift by
touching a Riftstone. By doing this they are able to draw forth specific Pawns
from the Rift itself and the worlds beyond.</p>

<p>They are widely respected in any society that is aware of their existence, but
that comes at the cost of being expected to confront the Dragon. Jealous or
snobbish nobles also like to impose “tests of skill” to Arisen characters so
they might prove they are “worthy” of the station.</p>

<p>The Arisen are portrayed as being unusually capable in the original games,
though it is unclear if this comes from their condition or if they were chosen
for being heroic in the first pĺace. Either way, Arisen PCs shouldn’t be built
on less than 250 points.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the ability to drawn Pawns forth from the Rift is a
0-point feature. At most it’s a way of acquiring an Ally (see Arisen Power-Ups
below), but usually it’s just fancier dressing for the usual Search rolls to
find and hire henchmen.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Injury Tolerance: No Vitals (Heart only, -50%) {3}<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>; Hero 2
{10};</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Unnatural Features (No heartbeat, occasionally glowing scar)
{-3}<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>;</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>: Unaging<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>; Can interact with the Rift through Riftstones.</p>

<h3 id="arisen-npcs">Arisen NPCs</h3>

<p>The Dragon usually only creates one Arisen per incursion, but it’s definitely
possible for more than one to exist at the same time. Even if the party already
includes an Arisen PC they might find others who are still hanging around from
previous draconic invasions. Their attitudes towards a PC Arisen will vary
greatly.</p>

<h3 id="arisen-pcs">Arisen PCs</h3>

<p>An Arisen PC will necessarily bring with it the narrative of the Dragon. It must
be addressed, even if it’s just a sentence in the character’s back story
explaining how they avoided the confrontation. If it’s publicly known that the
character avoided their “fate”, the positive reputation implied by the Hero
advantage can be replaced by a negative reputation for cowardice or laziness
instead, giving everyone a -2 Reaction and worth -10 points. Simply removing the
Hero advantage brings the cost of the lens down to 0 points. Adding the negative
Reputation makes it cost -10 points in total.</p>

<p>There’s nothing preventing multiple Arisen PCs from being on the same party!
Some of them might be old Arisen created in a previous invasion, or the Dragon
might just have decided to be more prolific this time around. It’s not like
anyone can stop it from performing the ritual multiple times.</p>

<h3 id="arisen-power-ups">Arisen Power-Ups</h3>

<p>Most Arisen tend to acquire the company of an extremely loyal Pawn shortly after
being marked, known as their Main Pawn. If this Pawn is an NPC, then it can be
bought as an Ally (100% of points, Available Constantly) {20}.</p>

<p>And while not technically a “power-up”, killing the Dragon removes the Arisen
lens from all of the Arisen it ever created, returning the hearts it retains to
their owners. Such characters retain the loyalty of their Main Pawns and the
respect of the rest of the Legion, but become normal members of their base races
and <em>immediately age to their natural age</em>. This <em>can</em> cause an ancient Arisen
to crumble to dust on the spot, and it’s the main reason why these might be
hostile towards their younger “siblings”.</p>

<h2 id="pawns--15-points">Pawns (-15 points)</h2>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/pawn_by_tiger_type-da2q9fi.jpg"/>
  <figcaption><a href="http://www.deviantart.com/art/Pawn-609246270">By TIGER-TYPE on Deviant Art.</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Any world subject to the cycle of draconic invasion is riddled with rifts that
open to a foggy place beyond it. From these rifts comes the Pawn Legion,
familiar yet alien.</p>

<p>Pawns, also known as “Myrmidons”, have no childhood, and no parents. They spring
fully grown from the stuff of the Rift. Some are created by an Arisen, others
seem to be spontaneously generated, and some are brought over from other
worlds. Despite this artificial origin, they are very similar to humans
physiologically and still need to eat, drink and sleep as normal. All have a
“birthmark” of sorts in the palm of their right hands, shaped like an Arisen’s
scar and known as the “pawnprint”. This mark sometimes glows when in the
presence of an Arisen.</p>

<p>The main difference between a human and a Myrmidon is psychological. From a
human’s point of view, Pawns have a cold and detached demeanor that makes them
hard to relate to. They do have emotions and the ability to display them, but
the way they do so feels “off” in way that’s hard to describe. They also seem to
have a problem displaying significant personal initiative, which is why most of
them make a living as errant mercenaries, singly or in small groups. Unlike most
standard fantasy races, the average Myrmidon is an adventurer. It’s the
“civilians” who are the rare exceptions. Regardless of their profession, all
Pawns consider themselves to be members of the “Pawn Legion”, and never fight
each other.</p>

<p>Pawns directly created by an Arisen are unflinchingly loyal to their creator,
and all Pawns are predisposed to respect any Arisen they meet. They are unaging
and have very long memories. Those who feel particularly well-disposed towards
their master or employer might offer a constant stream of advice drawn from
these memories in an attempt to be more helpful. Fortunately, they can learn to
tone it down.</p>

<p>When a Pawn is killed, their body dematerializes. They can be drawn back to life
from the Rift by an Arisen. This weakens the Pawn’s metaphysical cohesion, so it
can only be done a limited number of times before that individual is lost

<h3 id="pawn-npcs">Pawn NPCs</h3>

<p>In the original game, all Pawns are AI-controlled characters, and their
psychological traits as described above are a justification for their in-game
behavior. It’s similarly easy to make them NPCs in a tabletop campaign: any
sufficiently-sized city will have a small contingent of Pawns ready to act as
hirelings for an adventuring party. They’re a little cheaper than equivalent
human help, which compensates for the increased supervision their lack of
flexibility requires. Like any hireling, they will refuse to work for a party
who purposefully endangers or mistreats them! Word gets around, even among
Pawns.</p>

<h3 id="pawn-pcs">Pawn PCs</h3>

<p>PCs can choose to play a Pawn as well. In that case, simply use the racial
template above with the same type of template used by the other PCs in the
campaign. If another PC is an Arisen, then the Pawn PC will likely be their Main
Pawn, and should have a Sense of Duty towards the PC.</p>

<p>If no other PC is an Arisen but someone still wants to play a Pawn, it’s
recommended that the GM either change the limitations on the character’s Extra
Life or include an NPC Arisen who might perform the service of restoring the
dead Pawn. If neither appeal, feel free to delete this advantage and the
resurrection-related feature from the racial lens, making it worth -30
points.</p>

<h3 id="pawn-power-ups">Pawn Power-Ups</h3>

<p>Pawns who serve an Arisen for a long time or who develop strong relationships
with other non-Pawns might find their own souls strengthened by these
bonds. They may buy more instances of Extra Life for 15 points each, and Special
Rapport with their Arisen creator for 5 points. Additionally, they may buy off
the Low Empathy and Hidebound disadvantages from the lens. Extraordinary
circumstances might allow a Myrmidon to buy off the entire lens and become a
full member of their base race.</p>
