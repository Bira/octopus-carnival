            <p>Forgotten Realms has had a list of setting-specific elf and dwarf subraces since
its inception, one which differs from the setup in the 4e Player’s Handbook. The
FR Player’s Guide releases a few years before Neverwinter included a few notes
mapping them to the 4e setup, but those were mostly roleplaying-oriented. Here,
we go deeper and get variant rules for them.</p>

<p>Each variant has a set of benefits that replace standard traits from the
PHB. Players can choose as many of these as they want, so it’s still possible to
choose zero and play a PHB-standard character. Variants also have associated
background skills, which work like those from the themes and might also include
languages. If you pick a language, you’re fluent in it both in speech and
writing.</p>

<p>Note that you can still only have one background pick - if you choose a skill or
language from these variants, you can’t pick one from your theme or another
source.</p>

<p>In the rest of this post, we’ll be looking at the variants for dwarves. Next one
is elves.</p>

<h2 id="forgotten-realms-dwarves">Forgotten Realms Dwarves</h2>

<p>DR dwarves were forged by Moradin at the dawn of time, deep underground. They
reached the surface in a moutainous region and built one of its first mortal
empires. Divisions among this empire caused part of the population to migrate
west into the Great Rift, a plains region filled with underground caves. This
was lucky because some ancient cataclysm then wiped out the original
Mountainhome.</p>

<p>These plains dwarves split further over the course of history: some journeyed
further into the world, while some stayed on the Rift. Distance changed these
two groupings, though they remain on friendly terms and have a lot of culture in
common.</p>

<h3 id="gold-dwarves">Gold Dwarves</h3>

<p>Gold Dwarves are those who stayed on and under the Great Rift. They proudly
trace their ancestry back to the dawn of time, and as a result are a deeply
traditionalist people that places great value on codes of honor. They believe
each individual has their pre-determined place in society and frown upon those
who would reject their fate.</p>

<p>Before the spellplague, gold dwarves had started expanding and migrating out of
the Rift, and this is what saved them as a culture when the plague hit and
destroyed it. A lot of the survivors returned and are attempting to rebuild, and
the disaster also convinced some of them to seek new ways of doing things where
tradition fails them. Other clans have instead doubled down and become actively
xenophobic.</p>

<p>A typical Gold Dwarf PC is expected to place great importance on tradition and
lineage, and to respect their elders. Getting to know someone also means
learning about their family tree.</p>

<p>They can choose to replace Cast-Iron Stomach with <strong>Cast-Iron Mind</strong>, gaining a
+5 to saves vs. ongoing psychic damage. They can also replace Dwarven Weapon
Proficiency with <strong>Gold Dwarf Weapon Proficiency</strong> to become proficient with the
war pick and the maul.</p>

<p>Their background skill is Dungeoneering, and their background languages are Deep
Speech and Elven. They deal with drow and other Underdark denizens a lot.</p>

<h3 id="shield-dwarves">Shield Dwarves</h3>

<p>Shield Dwarves migrated out of the Great Rift early, spreading through the world
and encountering more foreign people over their history. As a result they’re
more open to seeking out friends and forging alliances. Though they also value
tradition and honor, they do not consider it dishonorable for an individual to
seek to forge their own destiny, even when it takes them away from home. Delzoun
was founded by Shield Dwarves.</p>

<p>Impermanence seems to be a big thing for your typical shield dwarf PC. They are
open to alliances and friendships because they know tradition can fail them, but
they are also reserved with those allies because they know allies can fail them
too. When facing problems, they’re all about striking first and taking control
of the situation.</p>

<p>Shield Dwarves can replace their Dwarven Weapon Proficiency with either <strong>Shield
Dwarf Weapon Proficiency</strong> (proficient in handaxes and battle axes) or <strong>Shield
Proficiency</strong> (proficient with the light shield).</p>

<p>For a background pick, they can choose between the Dungeoneering, Endurance and
Nature skills, or the Chondathan and Giant languages (FR has a lot more
languages than core 4e).</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>FR has been around since the early days of D&amp;D, so I don’t know whether generic
D&amp;D dwarves take they traditionalism from FR ones or if it’s the other way
around. Shield dwarves are the ones most similar to those in the core.</p>

<p>The Weapon Proficienty replacements seem to be about the same (low) power level,
but Shield Proficiency is more generally useful to any non-martial PC who
normally has a hand free. Wand and orb wizards, dagger sorcerers, many monks,
and so on. An extra point of AC and Reflex always helps!</p>

<p>Cast-Iron Mind is an awesome replacement feature to take when you know you’ll be
facing a lot of psychic enemies, which includes most things with the Aberrant
origin. Spoiler alert: there’s quite a few of these in the Neverwinter campaign.</p>

<p>The first thing I learned about the Bregan D’Aerthe is that WotC’s authors
really like them. This is an organization of mercenary drow led by this dude
named Jarlaxe Baenre, a swashbuckler that’s basically a wittier and more morally
ambiguous Drizz’t. Its members are all some sort of outcast from drow society,
such as members of fallen houses and “houseless males” (in the words of the FR
setting book). They can show up anywhere in the world and are always on the
lookout for an opportunity to turn a profit.</p>

<p>They started out as a ready source of sudden ninja attacks, but by 5e they seem
to appear in every published campaign as one of the factions in play, and even
as a possible patron for PCs. No matter where the story takes place, there’s
always a smirking drow asshole hanging in the background, ready to send your PCs
on cryptic missions and gloating that all went according to plan no matter what
the result of those missions is. Sometimes it’s Jarlaxe himself, sometimes it’s
another character.</p>

<p>This might have been the book that started the trend, and it did so in a
spectacular fashion: if you pick this theme, <em>you</em> are the smirking drow asshole
with all the secret plans.</p>

<p>Your story is pretty typical. You are a drow who survived the fall of your house
(which as usual for drow involves a massive assassination spree). The Bregan
D’Aerthe took you in and trained you, giving you a new chance to make a life for
yourself.</p>

<p>You’ve worked for them for decades, many of them here in the North’s
surface. You took part in many of the schemes that helped Luskan’s fall along,
and you witnessed the volcanic eruption. After that happened, the bulk of your
Bregan buddies left the area, since the pickings had become slim. Jarlaxe
personally ordered you to stay behind and keep an eye out in case the region
started heating up again.</p>

<p>Now that it did, you’re to look into everybody’s business, figure out what all
the factions in the are are up to, and find out how the Bregan D’Aerthe can
profit from their schemes. Jarlaxe is going to swing by some time to hear your
report and give new orders. So yeah, you’re acting as the cryptic smirking drow
“friend” to your fellow PCs while compiling a report for an even bigger cryptic
smirking NPC.</p>

<p>To be a Bregan D’Aerthe Spy, you must be a drow. You can be any class,
however. Any gender too, despite the “houseless males” bit above. The background
skills for this are Bluff, Dungeoneering, and Stealth.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>At level 1, you gain the <strong>Levitation</strong> encounter power, which is an innate
magic power few drow manage to master. As a move action, you can fly up to 4
squares up and move 1 square horizontally. You keep hovering up there for a
turn, after which you softly descend to the ground without taking falling
damage. If something else boosts you past an altitude of 4 squares while you’re
levitating, you fall to that altitude without taking damage after resolving the
effect.</p>

<p>At level 5, you gain <strong>Continuous Levitation</strong>, a daily power that when used
gives you the ability to sustain Levitation until the end of the encounter. When
you sustain it, you can move an additional 3 squares vertically and 1 square
horizontally.</p>

<p>At Level 10, when you grant combat advantage, enemies no longer gain the usual
+2 bonus to attack you. They still gain other benefits from having combat
advantage like extra damage or the ability to use specific powers, but their
attacks will be no more accurate than usual.</p>

<h2 id="optional-powers">Optional Powers</h2>

<p><strong>Sudden Stealth</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that lets you roll Stealth right
along your Initiative roll if you have any cover or concealment at the start of
combat.</p>

<p><strong>Fluid Steps</strong> is a level 6 daily power that uses a minor action and lets you
shift 3 squares as a move action for the rest of the encounter.</p>

<p><strong>Spy Sight</strong> might familiar to players of the Assassin’s Creed or Arkham
games. It’s a level 10 daily power that uses a minor action and gives you +5 to
Perception and Insight for the rest of the encounter.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I admit I’m predisposed to disliking the Bregan D’Aerthe, precisely because all
those places where they appear seem to go out of the way to picture Jarlaxe as
someone you’re supposed to love even when he betrays your party to make a few
extra gold pieces. What a card, amirite?</p>

<p>Still, I have to praise this theme for its willingness to peel back the curtain
a little and put a PC in the role of the sneaky quest giver. Remove Jarlaxe from
consideration somehow and it gets even better.</p>

<p>Mechanically, this is going to lend a roguish flair to any PC, making them more
mobile and stealthy. It works well for any mobile melee striker, but even
defenders are going to love the protection from flanking or the ability to get
up close and personal with those annoying fliers.</p>

<p>Multiple Bregan Spies in a party are possible, but too many mysterious drow in
one place can end up spoiling the mystery. A whole party of them would also end
up sticking out and having a hard time moving around undetected, unless you rule
drow make up a significant part of the general surface population in your
campaign.</p>

<p>The Spellplague was the big traumatic world event that switched Forgotten Realms
from its Third Edition to its Fourth Edition state. It’s tradition for it to
have one of those every edition change.</p>

<p>It happened nearly a hundred years before our narrative present in this book,
and it featured entire continents being pulled from a parallel dimension into
this one, fundamental and traumatic changes to the way magic worked, and yes, a
plague.</p>

<p>The plague was caused by excessive exposure to those chaotically-changing
magical energies, and it caused terrible mutations and curses in its victims. A
lot of them died, some suffered permanent disfigurations, and a rare few got
weird powers to go along with it. These people were known as the
spellscarred. The major changes subsided long ago, but there are still
occasional flareups of the Spellplague even today. Feel free to insert your
favorite COVID mismanaging jokes here, though this was written a decade before
the real-world plague.</p>

<p>In any case, if you take this background, you are one of the Spellplague’s
recent victims. You were lucky enough to be the kind that gains magical powers,
but that’s scant consolation since their initial manifestation blew up your home
and family. You spent a long time wandering alone and hiding your mutation,
because people notice they tend to treat you like, well, a plague
carrier. You’re not contagious, but good luck convincing them of that.</p>

<p>Anyway, you were eventually helped by a priest of Ilmater, the FR god of
compassion, who directed you to the city of Helm’s Hold. The god Helm died
during the original Spellplague, but his temple there has been converted into a
hospital and shelter for the spellscarred. You spent most of your journey there
trying to figure out how you contracted the plague in the first place, without
success. Now that you’re getting close to your destination, you started having
nightmares again, about the night when you changed, and about the whole world
being consumed in blue fire.</p>

<p>(These are similar to the Faithful’s dreams, but there is no divine salvation at
the end).</p>

<p>Soon there will come a time when you can no longer hide your affliction. How
will you act then? And can Helm’s Hold really help you?</p>

<p>There are no racial or class restrictions for this theme. The plague is pretty
egalitarian that way. The background skills for this theme are Arcana and Heal.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>At level 1, you get a spellscar - an obviously unnatural lesion or mutation such
as a glowing blue scar, tentacle fingers, or other such features. This gives you
a -2 penalty to defenses and saves from all Spellplague-related effects,
including attacks from spellchanged and spellscarred creatures. It also lets you
sense these creatures or Spellplague-afflicted areas if they’re within 5
squares.</p>

<p>Yes, this does mean Spellplague monsters can sense <em>you</em>, but they also get that
defense and save penalty against your attacks.</p>

<p>You also pick one of these three abilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dimensional Shift</strong>: Teleport 2 squares as a minor action once per
encounter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Twist Fate</strong>: Reroll a failed saving throw once per encounter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vanish</strong>: Once per encounter, become invisible for a turn as a minor action.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At level 5, you can draw on your spellscar to boost your attacks, even though it
hurts you. <strong>Spellscar Empowerment</strong> is a daily power that you can use when you
hit with an attack. It dazes the enemy for a turn, and deals 5 + (half your
level) damage to <em>you</em>. The price seems to be a bit steep even for a guaranteed
daze.</p>

<p>At Level 10, you get to pick a second power from the Level 1 list.</p>

<h2 id="optional-powers">Optional Powers</h2>

<p>The optional utility powers here represent an effort spent at mastering the
chaotic energies contained in your spellscar.</p>

<p><strong>Plague Disruption</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that uses a minor action. It
activates an aura 2 that lasts for a turn. Enemies inside have a -2 penalty to
attacks and “disadvantage” on power recharge rolls (i.e, they must roll the d6
twice and take the lowest result).</p>

<p><strong>Torture Reality</strong> is a level 6 daily power. If you’re targeted by a melee or
ranged attack you can use it as an interrupt to redirect the attack to a
creature adjacent to you. This can be another enemy or even an ally with better
defenses, but it can’t be the attacker.</p>

<p><strong>Morphic Recovery</strong> is a level 10 daily power that turns an enemy’s weakness
into your strength. If you hit an enemy granting combat advantage to you and
you have no encounter powers left, you can use this power to recover one of
those spent encounter powers of level 7 or lower.</p>

<p>The level restriction makes this less useful on paragon tier, since you’re going
to start gaining higher-level powers and replacing your lower-level ones. This
makes this power less useful outside of the Neverwinter campaign.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I like this more than Devil’s Pawn, as it makes for a more party-friendly edgy
secret. It’s even more FR-specific!</p>

<p>Mechanically, it’s also useful to a broader variety of characters, though I
guess each one will benefit less from it than an infernal warlock would benefit
from Devil’s Pawn.</p>

<p>The North has always had a reputation as a hotbed for cultist activity,
especially in these dark times, but this reputation is more than a bit
exaggerated. In truth, most of those cults are groups of young nobles from minor
families who get together to appear edgy, intimidate rivals, and have really
wild parties. They start their meetings with some mock evil ceremonies for the
lulz, then proceed to drink themselves into a stupor and leave a mess for their
servants to clean.</p>

<p>Choosing this theme means you were one of these “cultists” until
recently. Though you come from a noble lineage, your family was never wealthy
or very influential. You saw the cult as an opportunity to make useful
connections and advance your own wealth and power. Also, the parties were really
fun.</p>

<p>One day, you were late for a meeting. And when you arrived you found all of your
cult buddies dead, the room painted with their guts. In the center of the
carnage, the brazier you used for your pretend “diabolic rituals” burned with an
intensely hot flame that drew you in as if you were a moth. It lashed out and
etched a brand on your chest, and the pain caused you to pass out.</p>

<p>You woke up at home, but your hope that this had been just a nightmare faded
when you noticed that the brand was still there. You somehow recognize it as a
mark of Asmodeus. You fled your native Waterdeep in a confused panic, heading to
a backwater where no one knew you: the ruined city of Neverwinter. You found
allies and protection in the other PCs, though you are reluctant to share your
dark secret with them, and haunted by dreams where you betray them all.</p>

<p>This theme is the best choice for infernal warlocks who want to warlock twice as
hard, but there are no hard class prerequisites. There are no racial
prerequisites either, though since the PC is also from a minor Waterdeep noble
family they are likely to be a human, half-elf, elf, dwarf, or
eladrin. Tieflings with devil ancestors are also an interesting possibility
(guess FR tieflings are more similar to old-school ones).</p>

<p>The theme skills are Bluff and Religion.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, these features let infernal warlocks go at it twice as hard,
and they also lend an infernal “flair” to non-warlocks.</p>

<p>At level 1, the devil’s mark allows you to use the <strong>Hellfire and Brimstone</strong>
encounter power. This uses up a minor action and creates a zone in a Close Burst
2 around you. Creatures in the zone when it’s created take 5 fire damage (7 at
level 11, 10 at 21). Anyone inside afterwards takes a -2 penalty to all attack
rolls and defenses. The zone lasts for a turn.</p>

<p>The damage from Hellfire and Brimstone feels a bit low, but it’s automatic. And
the attack/defense penalty is useful for everyone at all levels.</p>

<p>At level 5, you gain a +4 to Diplomacy to interact with devils, and people or
creatures devoted to them (like diabolists or duergar). The brand exerts a pull
on them and draws them to you, whether you want to or not.</p>

<p>At level 10, you gain 10 Fire Resistance. If you already have fire resistance
from other sources (such as being a tiefling) it increases by 5 instead.</p>

<h2 id="optional-powers">Optional Powers</h2>

<p>The fiction here is that you trade a bit of your soul to learn these powers (or
to <em>use</em> the level 10 one), but that doesn’t have any more mechanical impact
than other infernal warlock powers. All of them also grant you additional
benefits if you’re an infernal pact warlock.</p>

<p><strong>Traitor’s Brand</strong> is a Level 2 daily power that can be used as a reaction when
an enemy within 5 squares hits you. You cause all creatures adjacent to that
enemy to take 1d6 fire damage. Add your Int modifier to this roll if you have
the Infernal Pact feature.</p>

<p>Int isn’t usually a high attribute for infernal warlocks, so the bonus is likely
to be low. But hey, it’s automatic damage, so every point helps.</p>

<p><strong>Shielding Hellfire</strong> is a Level 6 daily power that uses a minor action. It’s a
stance that envelops you in dark infernal flames. This gives you a +4 power
bonus to Stealth and Resist 5 Fire. If you already have fire resistance, it
increases that by 5 instead.</p>

<p>If you have an Infernal Pact, whenever your Warlock’s Curse is triggered the
stance also gives you a +4 power bonus on damage rolls from fire attacks until
the end of your next turn.</p>

<p><strong>Pit Fiend Harbinger</strong> is a level 10 daily power that uses a minor action, and
represents you fully embracing the power of your brand. In other words, you turn
into Devilman: your skin hardens into blackened scales and you grow wings and
horns. This gives you a +2 power bonus to AC, a fly speed equal to your ground
speed, and fire resistance equal to 5 + (your level). As usual, if you already
have fire resistance it gets increased by 5 instead.</p>

<p>The downside of the transformation is that you can’t spend healing surges and
you must make an attack on your turn each round or take damage equal to your
level at the end of the turn. This damage cannot be prevented or reduced in any
way. Warlocks already want to be attacking every turn anyway, but this could be
a problem if the last enemy falls before they can attack that turn, or if an
enemy prevents them from attacking somehow.</p>

<p>All of this lasts for a turn but can be sustained with more minor actions. If
you have an Infernal Pact, you gain 10 temporary HP every time you sustain the
power, which neatly remedies or mitigates both downsides of this power.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>This feels like an ironic take on the “edgy but not evil” trope, since a PC with
this theme <em>thought</em> they were that but then it turned out their pretend cult
drew the attention of actual cosmic evil.</p>

<p>You can still be an involuntary wielder of infernal magics if you stick with
just the features, but by default there’s nothing “involuntary” about the
optional utilities: they represent you willingly trading bits of your soul away
for more power. And both the level 6 and 10 powers seem like a very tempting
choice for an infernal pact warlock, be they full- or multi-class.</p>

<p>I don’t think multiple PCs with this theme in a party would work out. The
default inciting incident is very specific, which means all of the Pawn PCs
would have been present there. Them being in the same party set ups an
unsustainable tension between “no one must know!” and “this one
knows!”.</p>

<p>Also, the more Devil’s Pawns you have together, the higher the chance one of
them would succumb to the temptation of embracing these powers, dragging the
others down along with them. An all-Pawn party might start with the best of
intentions, but it would turn into an evil campaign quite soon. I’m not sure I’d
allow it in a group at all. If someone really wanted to play a warlock, I’d try
to convince them to take the Fey Pact instead.</p>

<p>There’s a bit of lore elsewhere that claims most PC infernal warlocks are
following an esoteric tradition based on <em>stealing</em> power from Hell, which
allows them to wield infernal powers without imperiling their soul and could
explain why devils generally dislike the character instead of being drawn to
them. Separated from its story bits, this theme could represent a warlock who
gained their powers through the more traditional path of making deals with
devils. They are more powerful than a theme-less warlock, but also more evil.</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned the Netherese several times already, and now it’s time to view
the theme most directly connected to them.</p>

<p>Okay, so we know that there was this ancient human empire named Netheril, that
it was ruled by archmages, and that it really liked building flying islands. We
also know that it fell overnight due to Shenanigans that caused its signature
magic to stop working and caused all of those islands to fall from the sky. And
we’ve also seen (spoilers!) that one of these islands fell on the Neverwinter
Wood. This island is named Xinlenal and it happens to be the first one ever
built.</p>

<p>Now, I think that either in the 4e FR book or somewhere near the end of third
edition, you had this metaplot event where the survivors of ancient Netheril
started coming back. Turns out another one of their island cities survived the
fall by crossing over into the Shadowfell, much like the eladrin did with the
Feywild. They spent all this time there, and were mutated by the plane’s
energies. Now they’re returning to the world bent on ruling it again, and are
engaged in sinister conspiracies the world over. These people consider
themselves heirs to Netheril and call themselves Shadovar. They’re fascists.</p>

<p>And sure enough, there are Shadovar in the Neverwinter Wood, trying to repair
Xinlenal.</p>

<p>If you’re a PC with this theme, you used to be one of them. Your early education
contained a lot of fascist drivel about how the Netherese were superior to all
other peoples of the world, and how they were going to reclaim their rightful
place at the top of the societal food chain once they returned. You were
assigned a post in the first scouting expeditions into the world, and fell in
love with all the warmth and sunlight you saw there. You also interacted with
plenty of supposedly “inferior” people that quickly dispelled the bullshit put
into your head by the Shadovar leadership.</p>

<p>You volunteered for a post at the location farthest from the center of Shadovar
power - Neverwinter. You managed to vanish shortly after arriving here, and now
live in the city, keeping your past a secret. But lately you’ve been seeing
signs and hearing rumors that tell you the Shadovar presence here is
increasing. The only thing that would get them this riled up is a repairable
flying city. If there really is one here (spoiler: there is) and they manage to
make it fly, then this could become a new major center for the Shadovar, and
you’d never escape them again. You need to stop them, if only to ensure you can
live a peaceful life here.</p>

<p>There are no class restrictions for this theme, but Scions of Shadow can only be
one of human, shadar-kai, or shade. Those last two represent whose bloodlines
were affected by the Shadowfell, or who were mutated directly. I think
Shadar-kai get a full playable treatment in the Gloomwrougth supplement, and
Shades appear in Heroes of Shadow. Even if you’re human, you’re still edgier
than usual.</p>

<p>The associated background skills are Arcana, Bluff, and Stealth.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The features here are all about your heritage brings you closer to the shadows,
even though you have chosen the light.</p>

<p>At level 1 you gain <strong>Eyes of Night</strong>. This daily power gives you Blindsight 10
for a turn when used.</p>

<p>At level 5, your healing surge value increases by 4 wherever you’re in dim light
or darkness.</p>

<p>At level 10, you gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff and Stealth checks.</p>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>More shadow magic!</p>

<p><strong>Flitting Shadow</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that can be used when you
reappear at the end of a teleport. The power makes you assume a shadow form for
a turn. This gives you Insubstantial, Phasing and Vulnerable 5 Radiant, and lets
you make checks to hide when you have partial cover or concealment from any
source, including from standing behind your allies. Shadar-kai get a teleport
encounter power, and classes like warlocks and swordmages can often teleport as
well. If you can’t teleport easily, this is worthless to you.</p>

<p><strong>Binding Shade</strong> is a level 6 encounter power that can be used after you hit
with an attack. After the attack is fully resolved, you gain partial concealment
and combat advantage against its target until the end of your next turn.</p>

<p><strong>Dancing Shadows</strong> is a level 10 daily power that lets you teleport 6 squares
when used. Until the end of the encounter, you can teleport 3 squares at will
with a move action. In all cases, you must appear in a square of dim light or
darkness. This also makes that level 2 power look a lot more attractive.</p>

<h2 id="impression">Impression</h2>

<p>Very edgy. The Level 5 feature and Level 10 power are awesome in a party that
doesn’t need bright light to operate.</p>

<p>The Shadovar/Netherese are a little less horrible than the Red Wizards, but only
a little. I wonder if you can capture their restored flying island and use it to
fight the finished Thayan fortress in a giant <del>robot</del> magical structure battle.</p>
