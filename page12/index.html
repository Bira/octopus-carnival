          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Dark Sun always had “half-giants” ever since its 2e days. They were very large,
very strong, and had this funky random alignment rule. Here in Fourth Edition,
they’ve been syncretized with goliaths.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Athasian goliaths are also known as half-giants. They’re not a natural species,
but a product of sorcerer-king experimentation blending human and giant
DNA. Nowadays, most goliaths live in the city-states, but there are communities
of them out in the mountains of the Tyr Region.</p>

<p>I think it’s official: The Dark Sun Creature Catalog has nothing nice to say
about <em>anyone</em>. Here, it says city-dwelling goliaths are brutal enforcers for
the templars and the Sorcerer-Kings, and that mountain-dwelling ones are
“barbaric raiders” who have little use for companions who are not “pets or
slaves”. Some of them dwell among the giants of the Sea of Silt, where they are
treated as menial servants but also permitted to take part in raiding.</p>

<p>2e lore about half-giants said they were so lolrandom that you actually rolled
on a table every day to see what half your alignment would be. This is gone from
their 4e incarnation.</p>

<h2 id="the-number">The Number</h2>

<p>As usual, goliaths are Natural Humanoids and occupy the very high end of Medium
size. Their speed is 6, and their signature power is <strong>Stone’s Endurance</strong>, a
minor action encounter power that gives them some amount of damage resistance
for a turn. Here, the specifics vary per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="goliath-enforcer">Goliath Enforcer</h3>

<p>Representing your typical goliath thug, raider, or mercenary, this is a Level 8
Brute with 105 HP. It’s armed with a <strong>Greatclub</strong>, and if surrounded by PCs it
can <strong>Push Through</strong> as a minor action. This is an attack vs. Fortitude that
deals no damage, pushes 1 square, knocks prone, and lets the goliath shift into
the vacated square. It recharges once it’s first bloodied.</p>

<p>Stone’s Endurance here gives Resist All 5 for a turn.</p>

<p>When the enforcer is reduced to 0 HP, <strong>Vengeful Clout</strong> lets it make one last
attack with <strong>Vengeful Clout</strong>, targetting Fortitude, dealing greatclub damage,
and knocking prone on a hit. Despite the name, the enforcer doesn’t have to
target the person who defeated it.</p>

<h3 id="goliath-enforcer-legbreaker">Goliath Enforcer Legbreaker</h3>

<p>This is the same Goliath Enforcer from before as seen by PCs in the mid-Paragon
tier, who have far surpassed it in skill. It’s a Level 16 Minion Brute. It has
the same Greatclub and Vengeful Clout attacks as the regular level 8 version,
but dealing appropriate damage for its level and minion-ness. Its Stone’s
Endurance makes it take no damage from the next attack that hits it before the
end of its next turn, which sounds powerful but is the only version of the
ability that would make any difference on a minion.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to note that both the Enforcer and the Legbreaker are worth 350
XP, so XP total ends up being an interesting guideline for when to upgrade or
downgrade a monster’s quality as it goes down or up in level.</p>

<h3 id="goliath-gladiator">Goliath Gladiator</h3>

<p>A better-trained goliath fighter usually met in the arena, with a big bone
greataxe and an arsenal of fancy tricks. It’s a Level 11 Soldier with 114 HP and
the Leader tag.</p>

<p>The attacks of the <strong>Bone Greataxe</strong> deal standard damage and immediately end
the target’s marks on the gladiator. It can also use the weapon in a <strong>Leg
Strike</strong> that targets Fortitude, deals the same amount of damage, slows and
prevents the target from shifting for a turn. And finally, it can be used in a
<strong>Skull Cleaver</strong> maneuver that also targets Fortitude, deals heavy damage,
daze, and impose a -2 penalty to saves (save ends both). This recharges when the
goliath misses with the power, so it will keep trying until it hits.</p>

<p>It looks to me like the gladiator really wants to get past the party’s defenders
with the help of its basic attacks, and then use the special maneuvers on the
party’s squishies that are likely to have a worse Fortitide defense.</p>

<p>The goliath’s leaderly abilities are all Minor Actions: <strong>Get Up!</strong> (recharge
5+) lets an adjacent ally either stand up as a free action, or make a save
against a dazing, immobilizing or restraining effect. <strong>Offensive Form</strong> lets it
mark every adjacent enemy for a turn. Its Stone’s Endurance gives Resist 10 All
for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="goliath-kings-guard">Goliath King’s Guard</h3>

<p>When you finally go meet that crime boss or petty warlord who has an army of
goliath legbreakers at his service, these are the dudes who will be standing
next to him as his elite bodyguards. They’re Level 16 Soldiers with 154 HP,
wielding halberds and wearing scale armor. Their weapons give them <strong>Threatening
Reach</strong> 2.</p>

<p>They might also have metal blades, because their basic attack is described as a
<strong>Halberd</strong> without any material qualifiers as “bone” or “obsidian”. They do
standard damage, slide the target one square and mark it for a turn. The
<strong>Mighty Clout</strong> technique (recharge 5+) deals heavy damage, slides 1 square,
and knocks prone. Their Stone’s Endurance gives them Resist 10 All for a turn.</p>

<p>A relatively simple stat block, but it’s good at its job of preventing PCs from
getting close to the boss. As mentioned above, it goes well with a small
army of legbreaker minions in addition to the boss.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Despite the vitriol heaped upon them by the book, ultimately Goliaths also fit
the category of People, so you might find them in the usual Mixed People
Encounters as well. They can be allies or enemies, free or not.</p>

<p>The stat blocks are pretty simple. Big fighters with big weapons. I thought the
gladiator was the standout here, lots of interesting martial tricks on that one.</p>

            <p>That’s the title of the entry, but I’ll try to not to use it outside of the
monster names since it’s a bit appropriative.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As as far as D&amp;D goes, these are our “top-tier” constructs, usually placed in
guardian roles but sometimes found following their creator around and responding
to direct commands from them. They’re made by binding an elemental into a
physical shell made out of some material, as we saw in the Monster Manual/Vault
reading.</p>

<p>Bone, clay, flesh and stone constructs are as common here as they are in other
settings, but not even the wealthiest and most wasteful of Sorcerer Kings would
make a construct out of iron, let alone other metals. Instead, Athasian wizards
have developed other models made of more commonly available materials. This
doesn’t mean the constructs themselves are common, as most of the rituals to
make them are jealously guarded secrets, and even those who still know them
don’t necessarily know the theory behind the recipe.</p>

<p>Mind you, metal constructs might still be found in the depths of some Green Age
or Red Age ruins, and they remain exceedingly dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>All of our specimens here are Large Natural Animates with the Construct
tag. They’re immune to disease, poison, and sleep. Everything else varies per
stat block.</p>

<h3 id="salt-golem">Salt Golem</h3>

<p>This is a construct made out of rock salt, which has some different properties
from common stone. The most relevant here is that it’s surrounded by a haze of
salt particles shed from its main body, which it can control. Salt is highly
toxic at these concentrations and the creature can send it right into your
bloodstream if you have any open wounds.</p>

<p>Salt constructs are Level 11 Elite Brutes with 278 HP, a ground speed of 5
(cannot shift), and Darkvision. They’re surrounded by a haze of <strong>Toxic Salt</strong>
that acts as an aura (2), which inflicts -2 to the defenses of any enemy
inside. If the enemy is bloodied, it also takes 5 poison damage when it starts
its turn in the aura.</p>

<p>The creature attacks with the now-traditional <strong>Slam</strong>, which deals heavy damage
and on a hit inflicts 5 ongoing poison damage and -2 to attacks (save ends
both). <strong>Double Attack</strong> lets it slam twice in one action. Its special attack
controls that salt cloud to cause <strong>Horrid Dehydration</strong> (close burst 3, enemies
only, recharge 4+), which damages then weakens and slows for a turn. If the
target is bloodied it the conditions become (save ends both) instead.</p>

<h3 id="dune-golem">Dune Golem</h3>

<p>This is a construct made out of loose sand bound together by air magic. It can
hold a humanoid shape, but it’s diffuse instead of solid, making it particularly
resistant to conventional attacks.</p>

<p>A dune construct is a Level 13 Elite Soldier with 184 HP. It has a ground speed
of 5, and a burrow speed of 5 on loose earth. In addition to the standard
immunities to disease, sleep, and poison, it also takes half damage from melee
and ranged attacks. Unlike its solid cousins from this entry, it can shift.</p>

<p>The creature is surrounded by an aura (2) of <strong>Gusting Sands</strong>, which counts as
difficult terrain for enemies inside. Whenever such an enemy tries to stand up
from prone inside the aura, they must roll a save. If they fail, they stay prone
and waste the action they spent trying to get up. We also see the <strong>Unhindered</strong>
trait here, which lets the construct pull grabbed victims along when it moves.</p>

<p>The construct’s <strong>Slams</strong> deal the usual damage, and grab on a hit. It can have
up to two grabbed victims, and can sustain the grabs for free. It has <strong>Double
Attack</strong>, so it could grab two victims in the same action if it hits with both
slams.</p>

<p>Grabbed victims are susceptible to <strong>Engulf</strong>, a minor action attack that deals
light damage but starts inflicting ongoing 15 damage until the grab ends!  And
then you have <strong>Shifting Sands</strong> a move action power that lets the construct
either shift its speed, or to shift half its speed and gain phasing during this
movement. While shifting, it ignores difficult terrain and can move through
enemy spaces, so this is a good escape hatch in addition to being a way to play
keep-away with the suffocating grabbed victims and their allies. One special
condition with the phasing here is that it only works if the surface in question
has a hole wide enough to let a grain of sand through, which shouldn’t be a
problem in most cases.</p>

<h3 id="obsidian-golem">Obsidian Golem</h3>

<p>Another construct made from a type of stone with specific properties. In this
case, obsidian is more or less natural volcanic glass. Like the stone they’re
made from, these constructs are very very sharp. They’re also deceptively fast.</p>

<p>They are Level 19 Elite Soldiers with 358 HP. Their speed is merely 4 and they
cannot shift, but they’re <strong>Razor Sharp</strong>. This property is modeled as an aura
(1). Any enemy inside the aura that moves to another square inside the aura
takes 10 damage.</p>

<p>Instead of Double Attack, obsidian constructs have <strong>Inexorable Action</strong>, which
lets them roll initiative twice and take two whole turns per round at those
counts.</p>

<p>The construct’s <strong>Slams</strong> deal the usual brute-tier damage, push 1 square, knock
prone, and inflict ongoing 5 damage (save ends) from the bits of obsidian that
break off and get stuck in the wound. It can also use a <strong>Stunning Handclap</strong>
(recharge 6+) which attacks all enemies in a Close Burst 5. On a hit it deals
thunder damage and stuns for a turn!</p>

<p>A rechargeable multi-target stun is a terrifying prospect. A lucky recharge roll
might let the creature use this twice in a round, which is a very bad thing for
the PCs.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>You’re gonna run into some of these things eventually in any D&amp;D campaign that
goes on for long enough, and these ones are reasonably interesting.</p>

<p>If guarding a site, they’ll either be accompanied by more constructs or by other
long-lasting guardians such as undead, devils, or demons. If found as
bodyguards, they’ll be accompanied by their masters and any other goons you care
to add to the group.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>One of the things we learned about the cosmology of Athas early in the Campaign
Setting reading is that its Shadowfell is locally known as the Gray, and it’s
suspected to block access to the Astral Sea and any other worlds beyond.</p>

<p>This becomes relevant here, because the people known as the Gith are said to
have arrived on Athas long ago, sailing from beyond the Gray in silvery
ships. Once here, however, they found out they couldn’t go back. To make matters
worse, these alien visitors found out that they were particularly susceptible to
the corruptive influences of Athasian arcane magic, which turned them Darker and
Sunnier over the generations.</p>

<p>Present-day gith are more monstrous in appearance than the ones you’re used
to. Their mindset is also more monstrous, which is saying something considering
these were probably githyanki invaders to start with. Despite the mutations
they’ve undergone, they retain their psychic abilities.</p>

<p>Gith organize in nomadic hunter communities, wandering through the moutains and
the Tablelands region. They make no particular distinction between standard
animals and sapient outsiders when it comes to chosing their prey, and think
both make fine eating. Some Gith groups are dedicated to gathering the scattered
parts of their original ships, hoping to reassemble them so they can get off
this rock.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gith are Medium Natural Humanoids with Speed 6. Their signature power is the
same as that of standard githyanki: <strong>Telekinetic Leap</strong>, an encounter power
that lets them fly 5 squares as a move action. Other attacks and abilities vary
with training.</p>

<h3 id="gith-savage">Gith Savage</h3>

<p>The rank-and-file of any large gith raiding force, the book describes their
lives as nasty, brutish, and short. These Level 4 Minion Skirmishers fight with
obsidian-tipped spears.</p>

<p>The gith’s basic <strong>Spear</strong> attack damages and lets it shift 1 square. Once per
encounter they can enhance one attack into a <strong>Telekinetic Pierce</strong>, which
targets Fortitude, deals the same damage and pushes the target 1 square. I think
this above might be the first psychic power I’ve seen that <em>doesn’t</em> target
Will. There are a few others in this entry.</p>

<h3 id="gith-hobbler">Gith Hobbler</h3>

<p>These hunters are level 4 Artillery with 46 HP. They prefer to stay far away
throwing Range 20 <strong>Javelins</strong>. Once per encounter they can throw a particularly
well-aimed <strong>Pinning Javelin</strong>, that does a bit more damage and immobilizes
(save ends).</p>

<p>If someone gets too close, they’re subject to the hobbler’s aura (1) of <strong>Brain
Fog</strong>, which inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks and damage to enemies inside. I
wonder if there’s one of these near me these days. Someone who insists on
attacking them in melee might force the hobbler to use its <strong>bone dagger</strong>,
which does light damage and lets them shift 1 square on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="gith-spearhead">Gith Spearhead</h3>

<p>A front-line fighter wielding a barbed obsidian-headed spear. It’s a Level 5
Brute with 76 HP. The <strong>Vicious Spear</strong> is pretty strong, as expected of a
brute, and can be used in a <strong>Focused Stab</strong> (recharge 4+) that deals more
damage and knocks prone. If the target is bloodied, the attack deals <em>even more</em>
damage and dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>If the spearhead is reduced to 0 HP, it lets out an <strong>Ancestor’s Appeal</strong>, a
Close Burst 1 that targets Fortitude and deals psychic damage. In addition to
the damage, a hit also inflicts ongoing 5 psychic damage, and a further 5
psychic damage whenever the target uses a daily or encounter power (save ends
both).</p>

<h3 id="git-drone">Git Drone</h3>

<p>Drones are gith that show increased psychic aptitude as children, and are
subject to a torturous training regimen to further develop their powers. They’re
Level 5 Controllers with 62 HP.</p>

<p>Drones emit a <strong>Brain Fog</strong> aura that works like the hobbler’s, but is much
wider in radius (3). They fight with <strong>Bone Daggers</strong> in melee and with
<strong>Telekinetic Thrusts</strong> at up to range 5. These deal force damage, and slide 2
squares.</p>

<p>Every so often they can use a <strong>Psychic Nova</strong> (recharge 5+). This is an Area
Burst 1 Within 5 that targets Reflex, deals untyped damage, and makes the target
suffer 5 psychic damage whenever they use a daily or encounter power (save
ends). If the target is bloodied, it instead deals ongoing 5 damage (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The one time I briefly played a Dark Sun game, one of the PCs was a “standard”
gith fighter, so I had thought the gith of Athas were both unchanged from their
astral relatives and playable. Turns out I was wrong! Mechanically they’re still
similar to githyanki, but their look and feel is pretty different than what I
expected, and there are no rules for gith PCs in the Campaign Setting.</p>

<p>Gith are commonly found in all-gith hunting parties, perhaps accompanied by
domesticated baazrags or other trained beasties. They can also be found in mixed
parties of People, whether as willing members or as slaves commanded to fight.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Recently, I became aware of the Quar. Aren’t they neat?</p>

<figure class="center">

<p>These funny anteater people are the stars of a couple of miniature wargames, the
28mm-scale <strong>Clash of Rhyfles</strong> and the 15mm-scale <strong>This Quar’s War</strong>. Both of
these have their rulebooks freely available <a href="https://rhyfler.com">here</a>, which is also where the
image above comes from.</p>

<p>An individual Quar is a funny little person who just wants to chill with a hot
cup of tea and a plate of moth cakes. Quar <em>societies</em> however are very, er,
quarrelsome, so most of their history is an endless procession of wars.</p>

<p>I was motivated to write this article both because I think the setting is neat,
and because the technical information about Quar weapons in the Clash of Rhyfles
game made me think I can stat them up in GURPS.</p>

<h2 id="very-short-setting-summary">Very Short Setting Summary</h2>

<p>The wargames cover a particularly turbulent period in the history of Aldwyn, the
Quar home world. It’s marked by at least twenty years of worldwide trench
warfare between two large multinational coalitions. The tech level is somewhere
between WW1 and WW2, and this is pretty much the war that introduced industrial
warfare to their world.</p>

<p>If the idea of these adorable creatures being fed into one of the worst
meat-grinders imaginable is horrifying to you, then you get the setting’s main
idea. I’ve heard it described as “grimsical”. It replaces the “dark” vibe from
“grimdark” with “whimsical”, but it’s still grim. The cuter the miniatures for
their soldiers and tanks get, the stronger the dissonance becomes.</p>

<p>The Clash or Rhyfles quickstart book centers on the two main factions of the
war. The Crusade is a coalition of former monarchies who successfully toppled
their old regimes and became republics. They’re led by the Republic of Tok, and
made up of many smaller nations that follow the same standards for equipment and
tactics. The rules here could be used for quar from any of those places.</p>

<p>On the other side, the Kingdom of Coftyr leads an alliance of the world’s
remaining monarchies to stamp out this revolution. Each kingdom here tends to be
visually distinct, as their whole thing is adherence to ancient traditions and
heraldry. Therefore, the book only covers Coftyr itself.</p>

<p>Free add-ons provide details for “sub-factions” allied to either side. These are
Crusader or monarchist nations who do their own thing on the battlefield.</p>

<p>As usual for wargames, both sides are morally ambiguous. Opposing monarchy is a
good thing in my book, but the Crusade is also the side that introduced
industrial warfare to the world. Coftyr flavor text is all about honor and
chivalry and heroism, but they adopted industrial warfare just as readily and at
the end of the day are still defenders of absolute monarchy.</p>

<p>I get the impression that the world of Alwyn could settle into a more or less
stable configuration if everyone just stopped and signed a status quo peace
treaty, but they’ve all been fighting for 20 years by now and none of their
leaders show any sign of wanting to stop.</p>

<p>As usual for wargames, you pick the side you think looks neater, paint them up,
and pit them against other factions in battles that would fit somewhere in those
decades of war. Most of these battles focus on infantry with the occasional
tanks thrown in. There seem to be airships, but I don’t know if they have
airplanes yet.</p>

<h2 id="quar-in-gurps">Quar in GURPS</h2>

<p>The typical Quar is about 1.5 meters tall and weights around 60kg. They follow a
largely humanoid body plan. Their skins can take on any of a large number of
hues, from yellows and greens to blues and purples and oranges. Often, they’re a
little mottled. Their diet tends to include lots of bugs, though those are often
prepared as ingredients in dishes that we would otherwise recognize.</p>

<p>Stat-wise, I’d say they are absolutely identical to humans. If you insist on
being strict, make them about a foot shorter than their ST would indicate, but
do not adjust their stats in any other way. Being a Quar costs 0 points.</p>

<p>Because that’s the thing, you see? Quar are just people. The horrors inflicted
on them are horrible because <em>war</em> is horrible, not because Quar are adorable.</p>

<h2 id="quar-guns-in-gurps">Quar Guns in GURPS</h2>

<p>Guns in Clash or Rhyfles don’t actually have damage ratings, just range and
optional traits. The results of a ranged attack roll depend entirely on the
degree of success for your skill roll. They might leave a target unaffected,
Gobsmacked (stunned) or Taken Out, which is different from “dead”: they might
still be rescued during or after the battle.</p>

<p>However, the skirmish game rules include enough fluff about the infantry weapons
of the Crusade that I kinda want to try statting them up in GURPS. If I ever get
the same information for the Coftyri ones, I’ll stat them up too.</p>

<p>The book mentiones the muzzle velocity and caliber of a couple of the weapons,
and if I make a guess about the weight of the bullet I can plug those three
things in the simplest possible version of the <a href="https://gamingballistic.com/2022/04/11/old-ballistics-spreadsheet-a-repost/">unofficial official GURPS
ballistics equation</a> to get a damage figure.</p>

<p>That link also contains a complete spreadsheet that demands things like chamber
pressure, which I have no chance of figuring out. So stuff like Accuracy and
range will be derived by the older method of eyeballing existing guns, as will
bullet weight.</p>

<p>The numbers in the original material are just there for color, of course. None
of them affect the rules of the miniature wargame itself. But if we take them as
true, we see that Quar are very fond guns with big bullets and powerful
propellant charges, fired out of guns with short barrels and very light
construction. The recoil on those is gonna be ridiculous.</p>

<h3 id="the-bogen-rifle">The Bogen Rifle</h3>

<p>The signature weapon of the Crusade rhyfler, the Bogen semi-automatic rifle is
said to fire a 12mm bullet at 580m/s. It uses a 5 or 10 round magazine and
weights 2.4kg “fully loaded”. Its effective range is 150-250 meters.</p>

<p>The closest real-world bullet to this one in GURPS High-Tech is the
.45-something family of rifle rounds, which are 11.43mm in diameter and weight
31 grams. After some fiddling, I decide to go with a slightly lower 27 grams for
the Quar bullet, which gives us exactly 7d damage. This is pi+ because of the
caliber. Picture them as being broader, shorter and rounder than Earth rifle
cartridges, which is in theme for all things Quar.</p>

<p>This gives us a gun that packs about the same punch as a real-world M1 Garand
rifle while having almost exactly half its weight and about the length of an M16
assault rifle. That’s going to have a significant kick, to say the least.</p>

<h3 id="the-rhyshi-r4-heavy-rifle">The Rhyshi (R4) Heavy Rifle</h3>

<p>Only slightly longer than the Bogen, the Rhyshi fires a huge 20mm round with a
720m/s muzzle velocity. Its magazine carries seven of those, and it’s said to
require a solid stance and firm support to shoot with any kind of accuracy. A
squad mate’s shoulder will do for support, according to the book, but I’m going
to give this rifle an integral folding bipod because I’m not a monster. A
properly braced R4 has greater range than the Bogen, and can penetrate up to
“medium” vehicular armor.</p>

<p>The closest thing to this I can find on High-Tech is the Mauser Tank-Gewehr 18,
the WW1 German anti-tank rifle. Its caliber is “only” 13mm, but it’s the largest
anti-tank rifle in that table that is even removely Quar-portable. Plugging its
bullet mass, caliber and printed velocity in our magic spreadsheet, we get 10d+3
damage, which following High-Tech convention can be rounded and written as
5dx2. Let’s also give it an armor-piercing round, because I see the WW1 tank
examples in the book have DR 45.</p>

<p>5dx2 is the same damage as the T-Gew18, but the Rhyshi again weights less than
half of what the real gun does. It’s not that much longer than the Bogen either,
so it’s gonna be a beast to handle unless it’s properly braced. As the book
says, Quar Crusaders frequently attach a bayonet to the Rhyshi because there’s
no way it can be fired in close quarters.</p>

<h3 id="grifkis-shotgun">Grifkis Shotgun</h3>

<p>This is a 10-gauge, six-kilo trench gun firing buckshot ammo. The only Crusade
gun to still be largely hand-made, it’s carried by officers as a badge of honor
and a symbol of courage. The illustration shows its barrel is fairly short, but
it still has a shoulder stock.</p>

<p>No need to fiddle with spreadsheets this time, we have a 10G double-barrel
shotgun in High Tech. Let’s borrow its stats and adjust for the shortened
“whippet” barrels:</p>

<p>The short barrels give this gun a more pronounced muzzle blast (+1 to Hearing
and Vision to locate when fired in the dark). I’m using the listed weight for it
here, which makes it about 50% heavier than the real world example from
High-Tech. Big caliber, two barrels, extra chonky? This is basically the Doom
Super Shotgun.</p>

<h3 id="h-11a-light-machine-gun">H-11a Light Machine Gun</h3>

<p>According to the book, this LMG fires the same round as the Bogen rifle, and the
Crusade likes to use it as an offensive squad support weapon. It appears longer
than the rifle, and can also be used in vehicular mounts when the force can’t
find heavier MGs to put in there.</p>

<p>I think I’m just going to crib from High-Tech again, and blend some of the
Bogen’s stats with those of the MG34.</p>

<p>This gives us a gun that’s actually heavier than the Rhyshi rifle, and whose
recoil is manageable enough that it’s worth firing more than one bullet per
turn. It fires rounds from a non-disintegrating cloth belt.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Look at those things. Just look at them. Their damage values combined with the
light weight and short barrel means they have <em>powerful</em> powder charges. Quar
like big booms and they cannot lie.</p>

<p>The recoil on these things means the act of firing them is somewhere between
“comical” and “painful for the shooter”. I’m guessing that a Taken Out result in
the wargame very often means the target got spooked and decided to play dead,
instead of actually being hit. This also explains why a quar can take
<em>themselves</em> out on a bad skill roll.</p>

<p>Athas has a lot of the same giants we can see in the Monster Manuals and Monster
Vault. Athasian giants are less militarily aggressive than their counterparts in
other worlds, but they still don’t like interacting with the “small folk”. They
prefer to make their homes in isolated islands on the Silt Sea. A giant who
wants to visit the mainland can often just <em>wade through</em> what to them is
chest-high silt. PCs might be able to negotiate a ride with such a giant, if
they’re diplomatic enough.</p>

<p>In this entry we’ll take a look at two Athas-specific giants, whose descriptions
will help explain why they don’t like the small ones very much.</p>

<h2 id="beast-giants">Beast Giants</h2>

<p>Beast Giants are the product of psionic experimentation by ancient masters of
the Way, who have stabilized into their own species. They have bodies similar to
that of hill giants, but the heads of beasts.</p>

<p>Each giant’s head is different, and can be similar to that of any Athasian
beast, whether currently living or extinct. So PCs might be faced with something
familiar like a Cilops or Baazrag-headed giant, or with some exotic ancient
cryptid like a lion, tiger or bear. Oh my! Their skill at mind-reading is such
that they can copy most techniques used against them on the fly during a fight.</p>

<p>Beast Giants are fairly cosmopolitan sorts and frequently associate with other
types of giant and giant-kin who share their islands: hill giants, firbolgs,
brohgs, and others.</p>

<h3 id="beast-giant">Beast Giant</h3>

<p>The typical beast giant is Large Natural Humanoid (Giant) and a Level 15 Brute
with 180 HP and a ground speed of 7 and Low-light Vision.</p>

<p>No matter what their head looks like, it gives them a <strong>Rending Bite</strong> that
deals heavy immediate damage and ongoing 5 damage (save ends). Once per
encounter they can use the <strong>Red of Tooth</strong> power to make three bite attacks on
the same action, each against a different target.</p>

<p>When someone attacks a beast giant, they can use <strong>Psionic Retention</strong> as a
reaction. They still suffer the damage and any riders normally, but they also
“retain” that result, so keep a note of it. They can then use this to power
their <strong>Psionic Release</strong> attack (melee 2 vs. Fortitude). A hit deals the exact
same amount and type of damage, and the exact same riders, as the giant’s
“retained” attack. Psionic Release recharges when the giant uses Psionic
Retention again, so it effectively “spends” the retained attack.</p>

<h3 id="beast-titan">Beast Titan</h3>

<p>The oldest Beast Giants have grown enough in power and size to qualify as Beast
Titans. They’re a lot more aggressive than their younger counterparts and love
displaying the skulls of their enemies as trophies.</p>

<p>These are Huge instead of Large, and they’re Level 20 Elite Brutes with 466
HP. Their ground speed is an 8, and their <strong>Beast Reflexes</strong> let them roll a
save to avoid falling prone.</p>

<p>Their Psionic Retention and Release powers work the same as the giant’s, with
the greater range and numbers from their larger size and level. Their <strong>Gnashing
Bite</strong> is also upgraded.</p>

<p>As a minor action the titan can use <strong>Titan’s Embrace</strong> (melee 3 vs. reflex) to
do some light damage and grab on a hit. And once it has a grabbed victim, it can
use <strong>Head Rip</strong> to deal massive damage, plus the same ongoing damage as the
bite. The giant also throws the victim 10 squares and knocks it prone at the
end.</p>

<h2 id="shadow-giant">Shadow Giant</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-giant-shadow.png"/>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Unlike the Death Giants of the monster manual, who are merely death-_themed_,
Shadow Giants are actual undead. They’re vengeful spirits who seek retribution
from an ancient slaughter, likely from the Red Age. They look like shadows cast
on a wall.</p>

<p>They tend to be loners, or to ally with those giants that still retain a strong
elemental connection (like fire and stone giants). Sometimes, a brohg renegade
will seek them out to learn the ancient arcane secrets the shadow still
rememebers.</p>

<p>Shadow Giants are Large Shadow Humanoids with the Undead and Giant tags, and
Level 18 Soldiers with 185 HP. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 7, and a
flight speed of 3. Like most undead, they are immune to disease and poison and
have 20 necrotic resistance. They’re also insubstantial, but lack Phasing.</p>

<p>A shadow giant projects an aura (5) of <strong>Shadow Malaise</strong> that halves any
healing that takes place inside. Whenever they take radiant damage, they’re
<strong>Revealed by Radiance</strong> and become substantial for a turn.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Necrotic Touch</strong>, which targets Reflex, deals necrotic
damage, and marks on a hit (save ends). They also have a non-basic <strong>Death
Touch</strong> that is similar, but exchanges some of its direct damage for an
additional ongoing 10 necrotic damage rider (save ends both this and the mark).</p>

<p>If a marked enemy makes an attack that doesn’t include the giant, they are
<strong>Cast Into Shadow</strong> as a reaction. This is a melee attack that targets
Reflex. A hit does no damage, but removes the target from play for a turn! This
means they’re stunned and removed from the map, reappearing at their previous
position when the effect ends.</p>

<p>The giant’s ability to possibly mark multiple PCs makes it a very effective
“defender”. Cast Into Shadow is a very potent “save or suck” attack, so PCs will
have an extra incentive to focus on the giant and not on its other buddies. And
if they don’t, the giant has just removed a whole PC from consideration for the
next round.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Athas is prime giant country and plenty of core giants would be happy as clams
living here, but I guess it makes sense to have some setting-specific ones to
signal that we’re not in Kansas any more.</p>

<p>Beast giants and titans feel a bit redundant, but their appearance is certainly
striking. Shadow Giants have intriguing mechanics, but you probably don’t want
to have more than one of these in play at any given encounter. They can also be
used in other settings without a lot of modification, as “undead giant with a
grudge” is a pretty universal concept.</p>
