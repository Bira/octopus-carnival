<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other.</p>

<p>This based on the Obliviax, a monster that showed up in the 1e MM2. It’s
completely changed for this edition, though.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Oblivion moss, sometimes also known as memory moss, is a sapient predatory plant
that lives in the depths of old forests. It looks like a carpet of moss, but it
can perceive its surroundings and move around slowly in search of prey. The
creature feeds on memories, which it strips from the brains of its victims. It
derives sustenance from those stolen thoughts, and can also use them to spawn
humanoid simulacra that help it defend itself and find more food.</p>

<p>The memory stripping process is not actually fatal or permanent, but it’s still
very traumatic. Stolen memories return at different rates. An adventurer’s
knowledge of combat spells and maneuvers might come back after mere seconds,
still in the middle of the fight. Important personal memories (“who am I?”) come
back after a day or two, but smaller details (“what does my mother look like?”)
can take weeks to be restored. Of course, the moss and its constructs are quite
capable of fighting to kill, and might choose to kill a victim anyway after
stealing their memories.</p>

<p>Dryads and Treants cultivate patches of oblivion moss close to their own
territories, as a security measure. Invaders who stumble upon them have their
memories ripped away and end up turned around, leaving the forest without
knowing what they were doing or where they went while inside. Even if the
knowledge comes back later, very few people are keen on repeating the
experience. As the book says, in places where oblivion moss grows, lost ruins
tend to stay lost.</p>

<p>You can turn the memory stealing around, too. The remains of a slain patch of
oblivion moss retain memory fragments from its past victims, and if someone eats
those bits they can acquire those memories. While the fragmentary memories of a
bandit might not give you their entire guard rotation or the map of their
stronghold, they might give you the combination to their main vault or to a
secret door.  That can be useful, though eating a sapient being presents obvious
ethical problems.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get a bunch of different stat blocks here, one for the moss itself and five
for the humanoid minions it can build from stolen memories. The minions can be
generated mid-fight by the moss, or they might be placed as normal monsters in
an encounter with or without their master.</p>

<h3 id="oblivion-moss-mindmaster">Oblivion Moss Mindmaster</h3>

<p>This is the moss itself, a Large Fey Magical Beast (plant) and a Level 12 Elite
Controller with 250 HP. It perceives the world with Blindsight 20, and moves
around at a glacial ground and climb speeds of 2. It does have Forest Walk,
though, so it’s not further slowed down by difficult terrain in its natural
habitat.</p>

<p>The moss projects a <strong>Mind Blindness Aura</strong> (1) that makes it invisible to
enemies that start their turns inside until the end of the enemy’s next turn. It
can defend itself in melee with a <strong>Corriding Touch</strong> that does immediate and
ongoing acid damage, but it really wants to use its psychic powers instead.</p>

<p>It has two basic ranged attacks: <strong>Scramble the Mind</strong> and <strong>Scour the
Mind</strong>. Both to the same amount of psychic damage. Additionally, Scramble slides
the target 5 squares and Scour makes the moss or one of its allies invisible to
the target for a turn.</p>

<p>Its ultimate attack is <strong>Absorb Memories</strong>, a ranged attack vs. Will that does
no damage. A hit prevents the target from using encounter or daily attack powers
(save ends). Hit or miss, the moss then creates a mossling duplicate of the
target, which uses the most closely matching mossling stat block (see
below). This recharges when there are no created mosslings in the field.</p>

<p>The mindmaster can spend a minor action to <strong>Direct</strong> a mossling, allowing it to
move its speed as a free action. And it can also <strong>Absorb Damage</strong> as an
interrupt, taking into itself the damage from an attack that would hit a
mossling.</p>

<p>So a moss mindmaster would only be able to keep a single mossling around at a
time. If you want there to be more of them, add some as part of the initial
encounter makeup. Those don’t count as “created”, so the moss doesn’t have to
wait to use Absorb Memories.</p>

<h3 id="mosslings">Mosslings</h3>

<p>Mosslings are Medium Fey Humanoids, and all of them are Level 12
Minions. They’re meant to be copies of people whose memories were absorbed by
the oblivion moss - the creature is smart enough to seek out competent
combatants for this purpose, since they make for more powerful mosslings.</p>

<p>Their signature passive trait is <strong>Mindmaster’s Thrall</strong> - if the mossling in
question was created by an oblivion moss mindmaster, it acts immediately after
its creator’s turn. They all have Forest Walk too, and a basic tendril attack
that does minion-tier damage and has a rider compatible with their role. But the
real star of the show here is the <strong>Simulacrum Attack</strong>, which allows them to
copy an at-will power from a PC!</p>

<p>If the mossling was created by Absorb Memories during this fight, it will be a
power from the PC that attack targeted. If you’re adding the mossling as part of
the encounter, pick a PC whose class is similar to the mossling’s role and give
them one of that PC’s powers. The attack targets AC and its bonus is based on
the mossling’s level as normal, but the damage and all other effects are
identical to the PC’s, as if it was the PC who hit. Some of them copy melee
attacks, others copy ranged attacks, but the match-up is not a problem because
you always use a mossling archetype compatible with the power you want to
replicate, not the other way around.</p>

<p>The book recommends having <em>the players themselves</em> roll and resolve the
mossling’s attacks, to reinforce the feeling that they’re fighting
themselves. That’s clever!</p>

<p>Here are the different varieties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mossling Guardian</strong>: Soldier, speed 6. Has an aura (1) that slows
enemies. Tendril attack allows it to shift 1 square and pull an enemy into the
vacated space. Copies a melee power. Use to copy PC defenders.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mossling Creeper</strong>: Skirmisher, speed 8. Deals extra damage with combat
advantage. Tendril strike allows it to shift 2 squares. Shifts 2 squares when
missed by a melee attack. Copies a melee power. Use to copy rogues and other
melee strikers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mossling Hurler</strong>: Artillery, speed 6. Explodes on death, dealing a bit of
psychic damage and inflicting Daze (save ends) on a Close Burst 2. No riders
on tendril attack. Steals a ranged power. Use to copy ranged strikers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mossling Grower</strong>: Controller (Leader). Has an aura (1) that grants +2
defense to plant allies. Tendril attack slows for a turn. Gives 20 temporary
hit points to every nonminion plant ally within 3 squares on death. Copies a
melee power. Use to copy warlords and other leaders.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mossling Vinecaller</strong>: Controller. Has an aura (1) that makes the covered
spaces difficult terrain. Makes a Close Burst 1 in to difficult terrain for
the rest of the encounter on death. Tendril strike slides target 2
squares. Copies a ranged power. Use to copy wizards and other controllers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think the mossling mechanic is really clever, particularly the bit where
players roll and resolve their duplicate’s attacks. It helps ease the GM’s
cognitive load a bit since mosslings are kinda finnicky even before you factor
the copied attack in.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, a moss mindmaster can only keep one mossling around at a
time. If you want to have more of them in play, the easiest way is to add more
of them as standard minions to the encounter. In this case I guess they would
have their own Initiative rolls, and would be worth XP as normal, but the
mindmaster could still target them with Direct Mossling and Absorb Damage.</p>

<p>Another option might be to turn the Mindmaster into a solo! Aside from the usual
adjustments, you would want to make Absorb Memories at-will and remove the limit
on the number of created mosslings in play. Maybe also turn Absorb Damage into a
Free or No Action to make it usable as many times per turn as the moss wants.</p>

<p>Nymphs have been in the game since the beginning, and they were always one of
its many, many “seductress” monsters. The only reason I can think for there
being so many of them is that Gygax had issues.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In Fourth Edition, Nymphs are fey descended from some of the oldest primal
spirits: the Sisters of the Four Seasons, and the Brothers of the Four
Winds. Thus they combine their mothers’ beauty with their fathers’ impulsive and
fickle personality.</p>

<p>After the Dawn War ended and the Four Seasons took upon themselves the work of
maintaining the world’s natural cycles, the nymphs withdrew into the Feywild and
spent a long time living there in harmony with nature. However, they’re not
content with just staying quiet forever, so they eventually began to range
further afield in search of fun.</p>

<p>Nymphs just love mortals. They make such wonderful toys, you see. It’s very easy
to convince them to do stuff, and to swear eternal loyalty and love. Toys
sometimes break, but that’s just how things are.</p>

<p>Nymphs are divided into subtypes corresponding to the four seasons, each with a
different basic personality but sharing the same disdain for mortals. There’s
also a fifth type that explains where dryads come from.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Nymphs are Medium Fey Humanoids with Low Light Vision and Forest Walk (meaning
they ignore forest-themed difficult terrain). All of their other abilities vary
per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="spring-nymph">Spring Nymph</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-nymph-spring.png"/>

</figure>

<p>Spring nymphs are always seeing new life appear everywhere to replace the
old. They have power over flowers, and adorn themselves with them. They are the
most childish and romantic of the bunch, so they enjoy seducing mortals and
playing mind games with them to get those mortals to chase her and to fight each
other for her favor. Spring nymphs will often ensure the prettiest mortal
survives these contests, and will then permanently dominate them through
constant exposure to the nymph’s psychotropic scent.</p>

<p>Spring Nymphs are Level 5 Controllers with 63 HP and Speed 6. Their powers are
all seduction and flower-themed, making them some of the most stereotypical
nymphs.</p>

<p>They have a <strong>Charmed Defense</strong> passive that gives them +3 to all defenses while
adjacent to a creature dominated by them. Their basic melee attack is
<strong>Passion’s Kiss</strong>, which targets Will, does low psychic damage, and dazes (save
ends). Their basic ranged attack is <strong>Song of Spring</strong>, which is similar but
does a bit more damage and slows instead of dazing.</p>

<p>When she doesn’t have anyone dominated, the spring nymph can use <strong>Floral
Perfume</strong> to rectify this situation. This is a ranged attack vs. Will that must
target a dazed or slowed creature, and on a hit pulls the target 3 squares and
dominates them (save ends).</p>

<p>Finally, once per encounter, the nymph can use <strong>Cloud of Blossoms</strong>, a ranged
area attack that targets non-dominated enemies, attacks Will, and slows on a hit
(save ends). After the first failed save, the target becomes unconscious
instead. So this is more of an emergency escape hatch than an opening strike.</p>

<p>When building an encounter with spring nymphs, you can add any number of sapient
humanoids of any species to Team Monster. These are her permanently dominated
pawns, and they should definitely count as “dominated” for the purposes of
Charmed Defense even if they act normally otherwise. Lacking any of these, the
nymph will do her best to keep a PC dominated and stick close to them. Spring
nymphs don’t do a lot of damage on their own, so they need the help of their
pawns. An encounter against <em>multiple</em> spring nymphs is very dangerous, though,
since they’ll be able to dominate multiple PCs.</p>

<h3 id="autumn-nymphs">Autumn Nymphs</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-nymph-autumn.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These are the most melancholic members of the family. Autumn is the season when
leaves are reaching the end of their lives and remembering their pasts. Autumn
nymphs are always in that mood, and love collecting and remembering the stories
of mortals’ lives. Autumn nymphs trade in secrets, one for one. This makes them
good sources of information, but you have to be willing to share your own
secrets in exchange. If you don’t, their vengeance can be terrible and
persistent as they turn their secret-themed abilities against you.</p>

<p>Autumn Nymphs are Level 8 Skirmishers with 89 HP, a ground speed of 6 and a
flight speed of 6 (clumsy, like a leaf in the wind). Their basic attack is a
strike with their <strong>Oaken Strength</strong>, which damages and pushes the target 1
square. Their other abilities are all secret-themed spells.</p>

<p><strong>Dark Revelation</strong> (recharge 6+) is a melee attack that causes light psychic
damage and stuns (save ends). It represents the nymph using contact telepathy to
fill the victim’s head with, well, fake news.</p>

<p><strong>Whisper Game</strong> is an interesting ranged attack. It inflicts immediate and
ongoing psychic damage (save ends). Until the end of the encounter, or until the
nymph drops to 0 HP, any time a creature saves against the ongoing damage the
condition “jumps” to the nearest of the victim’s allies within 10 squares. When
the nymph drops to 0 HP, whoever is suffering from this ongoing damage takes 15
psychic damage. This psychic hot potato recharges if the nymph misses with it.</p>

<p>As a move action, the nymph can use <strong>Autumn Winds</strong> to either shift 1 square or
move her speed, and then use Oaken Strength for free. And when an enemy misses
her with a melee attack, she can use <strong>Secret of Autumn Leaves</strong> as a reaction
to shift 3 squares.</p>

<p>The nymph’s first priority should be to get the Whisper Game going, then stun
someone with Dark Revelation whenever it’s available. After that she wants to
move around and herd the PCs using Oaken Strength so all of them remain close
enough to catch the Whisper Game damage. Autumn Nymphs don’t go for domination,
but they can still have willing fey allies to help with all that. Multiple
autumn nymphs in the same encounter means multiple Whisper Games and multiple
save-ends stuns in a round, so only do that if you really want to make your PCs
suffer.</p>

<h3 id="wood-nymphs">Wood Nymphs</h3>

<p>Sometimes, an autumn nymph’s melancholy gets the better of her. She grows tired
of her games, or discovers she had actual fondness for a mortal that escaped her
clutches. These nymphs cast off their humanoid guises and give themselves over
to their wild natures, slowly transforming into trees. They stay for a long time
in this in-between state, and some go on to become dryads. The Wood Nymph stat
block represents the in-between state, where the nymph can leave its tree body
to attack trespassers or despoilers, but can’t move too far away from it. This
is actually closer to a mythological dryad than the D&amp;D dryad is.</p>

<p>Wood Nymphs are Level 10 Soldiers with 104 HP and speed 6. They are
<strong>Treebound</strong>, which means they’ll be always encountered close to their
tree. This tree occupies 1 square on the battle map. The nymph can enter it and
gains full cover while inside. It also counts as an ally for the purposes of
flanking. While adjacent to or inside the tree, the nymph has <strong>Regeneration</strong>
5.</p>

<p>The nymph’s first priority in battle is to tag someone with <strong>Trapped in the
Wood</strong>, which does no damage but teleports the target inside the nymph’s
tree. This removes the victim from play (save ends). The nymph can teleport 8
squares to a space adjacent ot the tree as an effect. A successful save places
the victim back on the map, adjacent to the tree.</p>

<p>She can also hit a PC with her <strong>Lonely Keening</strong>, an encounter ranged attack
that deals psychic damage on a hit. The interesting thing about it is its
effect, though, which happens even on a miss. Until the end of the encounter, or
until the nymph drops to 0 HP, the victim takes 5 damage at the end of any turn
in which it’s not either adjacent to the nymph or closer to her than they were
at the start of the turn. An excellent attack to use on those ranged PCs.</p>

<p>Finally, the nymph can teleport up to 6 squares to a space adjacent to the tree
as a move action.</p>

<p>Not that the victim of Trapped in the Wood is not considered to be in the tree’s
space for game purposes! They’re <em>removed from play</em>. Which means the Nymph can
hit them with Lonely Keening, trap them in the tree, and stay adjacent to the
tree to keep her regeneration while damaging the victim at the same time.</p>

<p>Appropriate buddies for wood nymphs include full dryads, wood woads, and other
treelike fey who are hanging around their new sister.</p>

<h3 id="winter-nymph">Winter Nymph</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-nymph-winter.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Winter nymphs live in cold and remote regions, and like their linked season
they’re cruel and harsh. Winter nymphs are all about reveling in the survival of
the strongest. They run ahead of the Wild Hunt, dressed in buckskin, their
nettle hair spreading out behind them in the wind. They seek the toughest and
most cunning opponents as their prey.</p>

<p>Winter Nymphs are Level 15 Artillery with 116 HP, a ground speed of 7, and a fly
speed of 10. Unlike their sisters, they fight with weapons. Their basic melee
attack is a <strong>Hunter’s Knife</strong> that damages and allows them to shift 1 square on
a hit. Their basic ranged attack is a longbow that shoots arrows laced with
<strong>Winter’s Wind</strong>, doing cold damage and slowing on a hit.</p>

<p>If too many enemies crowd their space, they can use a <strong>Nettling Wind</strong>
(recharge 5+) to target up to 3 creatures in a Close Blast 5. On a hit, this
does physical damage and immobilizes (save ends). And once per encounter they
can fire a <strong>Hail of Arrows</strong> that works like like Area burst 3, Range 20
attack. It targets enemies, does physical damage, and inflicts ongoing physical
damage (save ends). That’s a good opening strike.</p>

<p>Appropriate companions for winter nymphs are, of course, the Wild
Hunt. Paragon-tier fey hounds and perhaps some eladrin or firbolg hunters.</p>

<h3 id="summer-nymph">Summer Nymph</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-nymph-summer.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Spring is about the potential of the future; autumn about reflecting on the
past; and summer is the present. Summer nymphs are among the eldest and wisest
of the seasons’ children, for they see everything as it comes to pass. Though
they love to play games with mortals just as much as their sisters, their own
games are much more complex, some times spanning multiple worlds and vast
stretches of time. They are the nymph’s equivalent of board game geeks, and they
love playing live-action Twilight Imperium and Diplomacy. Their motivations and
goals are always hidden from those she uses as playing pieces, and might look
inscrutable.</p>

<p>The nymph portrayed here is a legit demigodess, a Level 25 Controller with 233
HP and the Leader keyword. She is peer to elder dragons and to the greatest
among angels and devils, and she could end up interacting with gods or exarchs
directly. Not being an elite or solo, she’s not as individually powerful as some
of those dragons and immortals, but she can command nature itself in the form of
large hosts of animals, fey, and plant creatures.</p>

<p>The summer nymph projects an aura of <strong>Renewing Growth</strong> (5) that makes its
covered area into difficult terrain for enemies. Any enemy inside the aura who
doesn’t move during their turn is slowed until the end of their next turn.</p>

<p>Her attacks do below-average damage, but have powerful control effects. Her
melee basic attack is <strong>Wisdom’s Touch</strong>, which damages and dazes for a
turn. Her basic ranged attack is <strong>Eyes of Summer</strong>,  which deals radiant
damage and blinds (save ends). She can also <strong>Call Storm Winds</strong> (recharge 5+),
a ranged area attack that deals lighting and thunder damage to enemies, and
slides them 3 squares on a hit. The storm persists for a turn and can be
sustained with a minor action, which also allows the nymph to slide anyone
inside it 3 squares.</p>

<p>As an at-will move action, the nymph can employ her <strong>Omniscient Strategy</strong> to
shift 1 square and allow one of her allies to move their speed.</p>

<p>The summer nymph is a mastermind, so PCs will likely come into contact with her
minions and with the edges of her scheme long before they fight her in
person. If that happens, she will certainly be accompanied by a bodyguard of
similarly epic fey, including elder treants, mythical beasts, and eladrin
nobles.</p>

<p>She can also be used in a more ambiguous role, as a dangerous source of
information. She is guaranteed to know the answer to any question about the
present state of the universe, but the favors she asks in return are also
guaranteed to advance some obscure scheme of hers and make pawns of the PCs.</p>

<p>I’m pleasantly surprised that out of the five nymph variants we saw here, only
one of them is actually a seductress. And even that one is more about
floral-scented mind control than the “she’s just that sexy” trope of old D&amp;D
nymphs. As a bonus, the text never mentions the gender of the hapless mortal
victims, so this is equal-opportunity mind control.</p>

<p>My favorites are the winter and summer nymphs, who do the most to break that old
stereotype. The wood nymph comes next for her tree-based shenanigans, though
narratively she’s very redundant with 4e dryads.</p>

<p>Norkers have been around since the days of AD&amp;D, where their major mechanical
distinction was that they were stronger goblins with AC 3. They play a
significant role in The Forgotten Temple or Tharizdun as the rank and file of
the occupying force the PCs need to clear out before they can delve the temple.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Norkers in 4e are descendants of goblins who emigrated to the Elemental Chaos
and sought shelter in deep caves in order to survive the harsh conditions of
that plane. The earth-aspected ambient energy of their chosen habitat mutated
them over generations, granting them stony skin and minor earth-based powers.</p>

<p>Norker populations have since crossed back into the middle world, where they
live in mountainous regions, in the Underdark, and near fonts of earth-aspected
elemental power. Some sages speculate that the original norkers lived near sites
of power related to Ogrémoch, the Evil Elemental Prince of Earth, because modern
norkers are often found working for his cultists or those of the Elder Elemental
Eye, guarding his forgotten temples in another very obvious historical
reference.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Norkers retain their conceptual role as rank-and-file opposition for
paragon-tier (AKA “name level”) characters, which in 4e means they’re much
stronger than they ever were. Their levels range from around 12 to 15 here.</p>

<p>They’re Small Elemental Humanoids with Low-Light Vision and Speed 6, with
abilities combining martial training and minor earth magic.</p>

<h3 id="norker-stone-shield">Norker Stone Shield</h3>

<p>Stone Shields look like an unruly mob at first glance, but they’re professional
soldiers trained by those elemental cults and other earth-themed villains. Their
training and equipment allows them to fight a bit like a roman legion, keeping
tight formations, throwing javelins and them closing in to batter enemies with
their short clubs and shields.</p>

<p>Stone Shields are Level 12 Soldiers with 124 HP, which means a sizable group of
them can eat most typical human military units for breakfast. Their basic
attacks are a <em>club</em> and a <em>javelin</em>, both of which mark for a turn on a hit. If
a marked enemy adjacent to the norker shifts, it can attack them with a <strong>Shield
Slam</strong> vs. Fortitude that damages and knocks prone on a hit. And if someone hits
them in melee they can respond with an <strong>Elemental Rebuke</strong>, a reaction that
attacks AC and does some minor damage.</p>

<h3 id="norker-grunt">Norker Grunt</h3>

<p>Fortunately, it seems stone shields are rarified elites. The actual rank and
file of a norker force will be made of of these guys, who are far less organized
and prefer to use “charging horde” tactics with their clubs. Their natural
strength and toughness still makes them a very hard problem for human
militaries, and even PCs don’t want to get surrounded by them.</p>

<p>Grunts are Level 15 Minion Brutes, and their only active ability is their
<strong>Club</strong> attack. Their <strong>Harrassing Brute</strong> trait is what makes them truly
dangerous. All of the grunt’s allies get a damage bonus against enemies equal to
twice the number of grunts adjacent to that enemy.</p>

<p>Let’s unpack that for a moment. Let’s say 4 grunts are adjacent to the party’s
fighter. Each of those grunts will get a +8 damage bonus when they attack the
fighter. So will the grunt’s artillery and controller bosses who are 5 squares
away from this scrum. And so on.</p>

<p>Ideally, grunts want to slip past the front line and harrass the enemy
squishies, but as we can see from the example above they can still do pretty
well against defenders if Team Monster decides to focus fire.</p>

<h3 id="norker-stone-walker">Norker Stone Walker</h3>

<p>Stone Walkers norkers who received proper training in earth magic, and who
combine that with a mobile fighting style. They’re Level 15 Skirmishers with 150
HP. They can attack with <strong>handaxes</strong> in melee or at range, doing extra damage
if they have combat advantage. They also have a +4 AC bonus against opportunity
attacks.</p>

<p>Magic-wise, they have the same <strong>Elemental Rebuke</strong> reaction as the Stone
Shield, and they can also use <strong>Earth Glide</strong> as a move action to move their
speed and phase through earth and rock during this movement.</p>

<p>That last one makes them excellent additions to an underground encounter. Place
a couple of them behind a thin rock wall and have them flank the PCs after the
stone shields and grunts begin their frontal assault.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Tough norkers still fill more or less the same narrative role as before, they do
so in a very different way. I think my favorites are the grunts; the damage
bonus they grant is both very distinctive and terrifying to players. When
scaling their level, I’d probably make it +1/tier instead of a flat +2.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This is the first I’ve heard of Nerras, though it’s possible they originated in
a previous edition. If they did, their lore was completely different.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Many ages ago, a sect of mortal invokers called the Sect of Seventy came to
believe that the gods had grown too detached from the middle world in the
aftermath of the Dawn War. They had become incapable of defending it from the
many threats and hazards that lingered from those terrible battles.</p>

<p>The Sect of Seventy decided to claim for themselves the role of protectors of
the middle world, and set about building a grand work that would allow them to
keep watch over all reality. They used their divine magic to build an astral
dominion they named The Constellation of Eyes. Located far from all the other
known dominions, it consisted of a central reflective crystal sphere around
which orbited uncountable mirrors that reflected different parts of the universe
and could be used as portals to reach those places.</p>

<p>In other words, the Constellation is the ultimate panopticon, capable of
maintaining surveillance over the entire universe and allowing its owners to
instantly deploy to places of interest. The Sect intended it to be the perfect
“superhero base” from which they would keep watch over reality, but other
interested parties had far more nefarious uses in mind.</p>

<p>The Sect was unknowingly infiltrated by a small group of priests of Asmodeus,
who intended to seize it for themselves and use it to open a permanent portal to
the Nine Hells that would give devils free access to the rest of the
multiverse. The invokers only managed to discover this after the final ritual
had already began. The ensuing battle was every bit as epic as you imagine, and
the resulting flare of divine energy from both sides was strong enough for the
other gods to notice and send their angels to investigate.</p>

<p>The angels would have been a great help, but they arrived too late. As far as
they were able to determine, the invokers realized they were losing the battle,
and enacted a desperate ritual of their own that would bring terrible ruin upon
all that were in the Constellation of Eyes. The ritual worked. It turned both
the invokers and the Asmodean priests into the creatures now known as Nerras.</p>

<p>These mirrored crystaline humanoids still dwell in the Constellation of
Eyes. With no apparent memory of their previous lives, they spent the following
eons acting as dispassionate observers of the multiverse. Their observations are
recorded in specially constructed glass tablets that can only be read from a
slanted angle, and their collected store of information is one of the greatest
in existence.</p>

<p>Relatively recently, though, the nerras have changed their behavior and become
more proactive. They’ve taken to crossing their mirror portals and kidnapping
certain powerful and influential individuals. Back at the Constellation, the
nerras use their magic to create a perfect duplicate of the subject, with a
diametrically opposite moral outlook. Then they send both back home. This
predictably causes a lot of problems.</p>

<p>Nerras target both terrible villains and virtuous heroes in equal measure. Those
scholars aware of their history theorize that ancient memories of the nerras’
former lives are resurfacing and causing divisions among them, and that their
new activities are an experiment to see which between good and evil is stronger.</p>

<p>Nerras also travel to places they consider interesting to monitor things from up
close, and sometime they interfere in local events for inscrutable
reasons. Sometimes their interference ends up causing wars and disasters, some
times they prevent them.</p>

<p>Nerras despise demons, devils, and creatures of the Far Realm, but they ally
with other creatures when their goals happen to align. Even their occasional
allies have little insight on their true motives, which they keep to themselves.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Nerra are Medium Immortal Humanoids, with Speed 6 and human-standard
senses. Their signature ability is <strong>Mirror Step</strong>, an at-will move action that
allows them to teleport 5 squares to a space adjacent to a mirror or to another
nerra. This means a group of nerras finds it very easy to maintain a cohesive
formation, and that their preferred battlegrounds have lots of mirrors that they
can use for extra mobility. All of the ones we see here are Unaligned, and they
speak Supernal.</p>

<p>All of their other abilities vary per stat block, though they all tend to share
a strong “mirror” theme. Their levels cover the mid-to-late Paragon tier.</p>

<h3 id="varoot-nerra">Varoot Nerra</h3>

<p>Varoots are elite scouts and spies. They’re the first to venture forth from the
Constellation of Eyes to lay the groundwork for a nerra expedition. Their
ability to copy the appearances of others makes them great infiltrators.</p>

<p>Varoot Nerras are Level 16 Lurkers with the Shapechanger keyword and 116
HP. Their main weapon is a <strong>shard blade</strong> similar to a longsword. Their
<strong>Reflection Theft</strong> ability allows them to perfectly duplicate an enemy within
10 squares of it. The effect lasts until the end of the encounter, or until the
varoot attacks. If the varoot is adjacent to the copying enemy, it gets to roll
a save against any melee or ranged attack that targets it, with a success
forcing the attack to target the copied enemy instead. It also gains a +2 bonus
to attack and a +5 bonus to damage against the copied enemy.</p>

<p>Its last ability aside from Mirror Step is <strong>Mirrored Grasp</strong>, a minor-action
power that lets the nerra teleport an unattended object of up to 20 pounds /
10kg that’s within 10 squares and line of sight to its hand.</p>

<p>In combat, the Varoot does it’s Lurker routine by “hiding” next to a PC it’s
copying, attacking the copied PC with a damage bonus, and teleporting away using
Mirror Step so it can transform and try again.</p>

<p>There’s no way to pierce the varoot’s disguise with a skill check, at least in
the ability’s combat form. It would make sense to rule that outside of combat
this works like a doppelganger’s transformation: it lasts a long time and can be
contested with Insight vs. the nerra’s Bluff of +20.</p>

<h3 id="meerak-nerra">Meerak Nerra</h3>

<p>Meeraks are the rank and file of a Nerra strike force. They charge into the
enemy to cut it up with their spiked, jagged bodies, softening them up for the
more powerful individuals that always follow close behind them.</p>

<p>Meeraks are Level 18 Minion Soldiers. Their <strong>Mirror Slash</strong> basic attacks mark
on a hit, and their <strong>Mirror Defense</strong> ability is an interrupt that triggers
when they’re hit by a melee attack and deals 10 damage to a different enemy
within 10 squares. The meerak is still going to die from the hit, but not before
reflecting some damage to a PC.</p>

<h3 id="kalareem-nerra">Kalareem Nerra</h3>

<p>Kalareems are elite knights among the nerra. Unlike a lot of their crystalline
relatives, they look like they’re made out of mirror-smooth liquid metal. This
makes them hard to hurt, and they can also briefly solidify parts of their
bodies to launch a spray of deadly metal shards.</p>

<p>Kalareem Nerras are Level 19 Soldiers with 175 HP. Their liquid metal
construction doesn’t translate to specific abilities but it’s a nice
in-character explanation for the high defenses and HP a level 19 Soldier
has. Their basic attack is a <strong>Shard Blade</strong> that damages and marks on a hit, as
do the <strong>Shard Blasts</strong> they can fire at-will in a Close Burst 3 pattern.</p>

<p>Aside from the standard nerra Mirror Step, they also have two other
mirror-themed abilities that make them good bodyguards. <strong>Mirror Image</strong> is an
interrupt that triggers when a marked enemy makes a melee or ranged attack that
doesn’t include the nerra as a target. It makes the enemy target the nerra
instead. <strong>Mirror Defense</strong> is another interrupt that triggers when the kalareem
is hit by a melee attack. The creature can then make an attack against the Will
of the triggering enemy, which on a hit deals the same damage inflicted by the
triggering attack. This is an interrupt, so the attacker gets damaged <em>before</em>
the nerra, and if they get reduced to 0 HP the kalareem wouldn’t suffer the
damage.</p>

<h3 id="sillit-nerra">Sillit Nerra</h3>

<p>Sillits are nerra spellcasters, who often act as field agents and
mystically-oriented scouts. Like other spellcasting monsters, out of combat they
should have access to whatever rituals are required by the story. In combat,
they use mirror-themed spells and specialize in forcibly teleporting enemies.</p>

<p>Sillits are Level 19 Controllers with 181 HP. Even their basic attack is a
<strong>Mirror Portal</strong> that targets Will, and on a hit damages and teleports the
target adjacent to one of the sillit’s allies within 10 squares. Their basic
ranged attack is <strong>Warped Image</strong>, which targets Fortitude and on a hit damages
and teleports the target 3 squares.</p>

<p>Their special attack is <strong>Captured Image</strong> (recharge 5+), a ranged power that
targets Will. On a hit it removes the target from play (save ends), trapping it
within the mirrors that make up the sillit’s body. While the target is captured,
it takes 20 damage whenever the sillit is damaged. The effect ends when the
target successfully saves, or when the sillit is reduced to 0 HP. When this
happens the target appears on a square of the sillit’s choice within 5 squares
of the sillit itself. Yes, it’s entirely possible that a sillit who gets lucky
with its recharge rolls will manage to capture multiple targets at the same
time.</p>

<p>Sillits have the standard Mirror Step power, and the same Mirrored Grasp power
of the Varoots.</p>

<p>Judging from their powers, Sillits love to fight in maps containing plenty of
hazardous terrain, and accompanied by bruiser allies. They’ll use Captured Image
as soon and as often as they can, and then move to the front lines to dare PCs
to attack them. Inconveniently strong melee PCs can be teleported next to the
bruisers with Mirror Portal, and Warped Image is good for disrupting the
remaining PCs if no other opportunities arise. Hazardous terrain on the
battlefield makes those forced teleports more dangerous.</p>

<h3 id="delphar-nerra">Delphar Nerra</h3>

<p>Delphars are the officers and commanders of nerra forces. They’re similar to
kalareems in their training, but they’re much larger and their mere presence has
bolstering effects on the abilities of their allies.</p>

<p>Unlike other nerra, delphars are Large and have Speed 8. They’re Level 20
Soldiers with 187 HP and the Leader tag. They project a <strong>Mirrored Rampart</strong>
aura (5) that extends the range of other nerras’ Mirror Step to 10. They fight
with a <strong>Shard Blade</strong> and <strong>Shard Blasts</strong> that have the same effects as those
of kalareems, with slightly higher numbers.</p>

<p>They have a different way of punishing marked enemies, though: <strong>Mirrored
Grasp</strong> triggers when a marked enemy within 10 squares ignores the mark, and
teleports the enemy adjacent to the delphar.</p>

<h3 id="teltarym-nerra">Teltarym Nerra</h3>

<p>You would expect the strongest monster in the entry to be some sort of dread
overlord, but we’re talking about topsy-turvy mirror people here. Teltarym are
the nerra’s manual laborers, joining the fight either because they must defend
themselves or because they were ordered to. Despite not being formal combatants
they’re very strong and aggressive, charging in to smash enemies with their huge
fists, and reflecting their own wounds back at their attackers.</p>

<p>Teltarym are Level 21 Brutes with 237 HP. Like delphars, they’re Large and have
Speed 8. Their basic attack is a <strong>Hammer Fist</strong> that damages and pushes 1
square, and they can use it twice in the same action. <strong>Reflected Pain</strong> is a
reaction that triggers when they’re hit by a melee attack, and which inflicts
half the damage they suffered to the attacker. This recharges when they’re first
bloodied. Their last ability is Mirror Step, so like most brutes they’re fairly
simple to run.</p>

<p>These are the perfect bruiser allies for Sillits!</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like the lore of the nerra quite a lot. It’s nice and epic and introduces a
new and interesting location on the Astral Sea. I also like how they’re depicted
as enigmatic instead of evil. A campaign against nerra is one where violence
might be necessary to drive them off, but where true victory can only be
achieved through unraveling their mysteries.</p>

<p>Mechanics wise it seems varoots are a bit too low level to hang out with their
nerra buddies, so you’re going to meet them alone at the start of a
nerra-focused story arc. They might be accompanied by local agents or
mecernaries. The others are all of a level range where you can use them to build
all-nerra encounter groups.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Back in 1982, there was a movie named <em>The Dark Crystal</em>. It introduced these
cool villainous vulture people called the Skeksis, which became kind of
iconic. D&amp;D wanted in on some of that action, so it added a species called the
Nagpa to Mystara. Nagpas are to Skeksis what Halflings are to Hobbits, which
means that they started out just barely different enough to avoid a lawsuit and
got significantly changed in each subsequent edition. This is their 4e debut.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, during the Dawn War, the Primordials realized they needed
servitors that could act as special forces. They already commanded uncountable
hordes of elementals, but they were mostly dumb as rocks and only good as shock
troops. Giants and djinns were smart and individually powerful, but too few in
number.</p>

<p>So they decided to take a page from the playbook of the gods and create a
servitor species they named the nagpas. Created to be as beautiful as nymphs and
as clever as devils, the nagpas readily took to their new role and proceeded to
wreak havoc on the armies of the gods for a time.</p>

<p>However, when the Dawn War was nearing its end, the nagpas were clever enough to
realize that their side would lose. And so it was that they made a deal with the
gods to betray their masters. However, they were caught, and the primordials
cursed them.</p>

<p>The curse took away the beauty of the nagpas, turning them into horrid
vulture-like beings. It also doomed them to never touch that which they desired
the most. A nagpa who loved fine food and wine would always taste foulness when
he tried to eat or drink. One who loved art would see it crumble at a touch.</p>

<p>Nagpas were either already immortal, or were made so by the curse. Even when
slain, they reincarnate within a few decades with all memories of their previous
lives and deaths. Every nagpa alive today remembers their life before the curse,
and is obsessed with those things it cannot have. They tend to destroy mirrors
or any other surface that can show them their own faces.</p>

<p>The primordial curse angle is interesting. Without it, you could argue that
their vulture-like appearance is a subjective thing. Some people think they’re
ugly, they themselves like it just fine. But a curse might make them
“axiomatically” ugly: not only are others unable to see beauty in them, they are
incapable of seeing it in themselves.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Nagpas are Medium Elemental Humanoids with Low-Light Vision and a speed
of 6. Everything else comes from training and varies per stat block. The two
stat blocks here have a wizardly bent, and use magic with a corruption and decay
theme.</p>

<h3 id="nagpa-corruptor">Nagpa Corruptor</h3>

<p>The Nagpa Corruptor is given as an example of an art-loving nagpa. Its lair
looks like a museum, with cordoned-off works of art on display (but no
reflective surfaces!). It employs a large number with a similarly evil
disposition to protect its collection and acquire more pieces for it.</p>

<p>Corruptors are Level 9 Controllers with 97 HP. Their basic attacks are a
<strong>withering staff</strong> that deals necrotic damage and pushes 2 squares, and a
ranged <strong>Withering Blast</strong> that deals necrotic damage and immobilizes (save
ends).</p>

<p>They can also use a ranged <strong>Devouring Fire</strong> (recharge 5+) spell that deals
fire damage and ongoing fire damage (save ends). Each failed save also deals a
bit of fire damage to up to 3 enemies adjacent to the target. The text says
“each ally” but I’m interpreting that to mean “each ally of the target”.</p>

<p>Their strongest attack is an encounter power named <strong>Corrupting Curse</strong>, a close
blast 5 that deals necrotic damage and creates a zone that prevents enemies
inside from regaining HP. It lasts until the end of the encounter. Their other
encounter power is an <strong>Enervating Blast</strong>. It’s another close blast 5 that can
be cast as a minor action, deals no damage and weakens those it hits for a turn.</p>

<p>Corruptors let their hired muscle do most of the fighting, hitting their enemies
with opportunistic spells from afar. They’re one of the rare monsters that
include more specific “director’s notes” in their text, though: if the fight
happens inside the corruptor’s lair/gallery, PCs should be able to its beloved
art objects. The first time one is destroyed, the corruptor becomes dazed for a
turn.</p>

<h3 id="nagpa-carrion-lord">Nagpa Carrion Lord</h3>

<p>This one is a gourmand who loved good food and drink, but who is cursed to only
taste ashes and filth when it eats. It still likes holding feasts, but its
inability to enjoy them fill it with rage and frustration, which it takes out on
any nearby PCs.</p>

<p>The Carrion Lord is a Level 14 Artillery monster with 111 HP. All of its
abilities have a “rot” theme, starting with the <strong>Rotting Staff</strong> basic melee
attack that targets Fortitude and does necrotic damage. Its basic ranged attack
is the <strong>Bolt of Putrescence</strong>, targetting Reflex and doing, you guessed it,
necrotic damage.</p>

<p><strong>Hand of Ruin</strong> (recharge 5+) is a ranged attack that changes things up a
little and does acid damage. <strong>Consuming Shadows</strong> (encounter) is a ranged area
attack that deals immediate and ongoing necrotic damage, and creates a zone that
blocks line of sight to the carrion lord’s enemies. Its allies can see through
it just fine, though. It lasts for a turn and can be sustained with a minor
action. The lord’s last encounter power is <strong>Ghostly Escape</strong>, a minor action
that gives it insubstantial and phasing for a turn.</p>

<p>The Carrion Lord likely opens the fight with Consuming Shadows, and then keeps
using its two ranged attacks from beyond the sight of the PCs while its
melee-oriented bodyguards keep them pinned in place. Ghostly escape is reserved
for doing what its name says, and letting the nagpa get away after it sees the
fight is lost.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m going to say the same thing everyone who has reviewed a Nagpa entry always
says: they’re skeksis. The way in which they’re skeksis tends to vary with the
edition, though. I think the ones from the source material were pursuing
immortality. These ones achieved it, but found that it brings them no joy.</p>
