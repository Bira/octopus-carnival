<p>This is another one of those entries that gives us more stat blocks for monsters
introduced in the first Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>We already covered the bulk of cyclops lore in the corresponding <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/09/03/cyclops.html">Monster Manual
post</a>, so I’ll going to say it’s super cool and ask you to read the original
post again.</p>

<p>We get some specific lore for the two new variants: Cyclops Crushers are
employed as slave minders, directing their crushing towards any who step out of
line. Feyblades are pampered bodyguards who rarely engaged in manual labor, and
like to lord their superior status over their less important colleagues.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/09/03/cyclops.html">original post</a> also contains the traits for cyclopes, but I’ll summarize
them again for convenience: they’re Large Fey Humanoids, trained in perception,
and have Truesight, which lets them see invisible creatures and objects. They
all also have some sort of Evil Eye ability that varies per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-crusher">Cyclops Crusher</h3>

<p>This one appears in the Monster Vault, so it’s also covered in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/09/03/cyclops.html">original
post</a>. Its MM2 stat block is identical as far as abilities go, but suffers
from all the math bugs common at the time of publication. Go with the Monster
Vault stat block and you won’t be missing anything.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-feyblade">Cyclops Feyblade</h3>

<p>The first cyclops we haven’t already seen in our Let’s Reads is a Level 21
Soldier with 200 HP, which means it’s significantly stronger than all the other
cyclopes we’ve seen so far. It wears mail and fights with a longsword. Its speed
is 8. It’s more or less equivalent to a simplified PC swordmage.</p>

<p>Despite its greater level the feyblade is actually very mechanically simple. The
<strong>Longsword</strong> is its most basic and best attack, doing physical damage with no
riders. The <strong>Evil Eye</strong> is a Ranged 20 minor action that marks a target
automatically, lasting until the end of the encounter or until the feyblade
marks someone else.</p>

<p>This cyclops earns its title because it knows <strong>Wildstep</strong>, an immediate
interrupt that triggers when the marked victim ignores the mark. The feyblade
can then teleport 10 squares to be adjacent to the victim and make an attack to
it that deals sligthly less damage than the basic sword.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Not all cyclopes are slaves to the fomorians, but the MM2 seems to want to
emphasize their “natural” position as someone else’s goons and mentions they can
also be found serving firbolg and drow. This would eventually be elaborated into
a code of honor that prevents oaths of servitude from being broken.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 13: 2 crushers, 2 eladrin bladesingers and 1
firbolg moon seer.</p>

<p>Cyclopes are cool, and more of them means more choice for a fey paragon campaign
versus the Fomorians. So I like these ones.</p>

<p>Couatls are inspired by Aztec mythology and have been in the game since at least
AD&amp;D 1st Edition. They were given a significant role in the lore of Eberron, and
I guess this entry brings that to their generic depiction.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Couatls are sapient winged serpents widely known for their great virtue, wisdom
and power. They have opposed demons and other servants of evil since ancient
times.</p>

<p>All of this is true, but it’s not the whole truth. It’s less widely known that
couatl righteousness can end up crossing the line into self-righteousness. Each
individual tends to have specific plans that they pursue with single-minded
dedication, and being convinced of their own rectitude they tend to not see
people who get in the way of those plans with good eyes.</p>

<p>Those plans are never actually evil, of course: they’re stuff like protecting a
village or other region, pushing a mortal along a destined path, sealing a
planar breach, or preventing one from opening in the first place. Still, it’s
very possible for a bunch of well-meaning PCs ignorant of the wider picture to
get in the way of a couatl’s plans and draw the creature’s wrath.</p>

<p>Ancient legends say that couatls were born of the world’s first light, and that
they fought alongside the gods during the Dawn War. They were supposedly
responsible for binding a great number of powerful and dangerous creatures in
the world or in other planes, and a lot of those mysterious plans have something
to do with keeping those creatures bound.</p>

<p>Couatls have the innate ability to travel from any plane to the Astral Sea in 10
minutes, arriving at a random location or at a teleporation circle they
know. They can likely also use standard rituals to travel from the Sea to
elsewhere.</p>

<p>In Eberron, if I’m not mistaken, couatls are the ones responsible for binding
the demonic Lords of Dust in the distant past, and their magic have a lot to do
with the deepest secrets of the Silver Flame.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Couatls are Large Immortal Magical Beasts with the Reptile keyword. They have a
ground speed of 6 and a flight speed of 8 with Hover. And they also have two
signature traits:</p>

<p><strong>Radiant Absorption</strong> makes it so that when a couatl takes radiant damage, its
own attacks deal 5 extra radiant damage until the end of its next turn. <strong>Twist
Free</strong> allows them to roll saves against the immobilized and restrained
conditions both at the start and end of their turns. This applies even when the
conditions would end after a set time instead of being (save ends): in that
case, the start-of-turn save could terminate the condition early.</p>

<p>The two stat blocks we get here are Unaligned, which I guess is what you get
when you combine “opposes evil” with “is a smug snake”.</p>

<h3 id="couatl-cloud-serpent">Couatl Cloud Serpent</h3>

<p>Cloud Serpents are Level 18 Artillery with 135 HP and all standard couatl
traits. They prefer to fight by shooting lasers and lightning from above (and
far away).</p>

<p>This most often takes the form of a <strong>Sky Bolt</strong> (Ranged 20 vs. Reflex) which
deals lightning and radiant damage. If the opposition clusters together they’ll
use <strong>Snaking Arcs</strong> (Area Burst 3 within 20 vs. Reflex), which is a little
weaker but covers an area. It recharges once they’re first bloodied.</p>

<p>If an enemy manages to get close to them they can use a Reach 2 <strong>bite</strong>, which
is a bit weak but deals ongoing poison and radiant damage (save ends). Even
their venom is shiny! They can also push the interloper away with <strong>Hurtling
Coils</strong> (Reach 2 vs. Fortitude, minor action 1/round), a non-damaging attack
that pushes targets 2 squares and knocks them prone.</p>

<h3 id="couatl-star-serpent">Couatl Star Serpent</h3>

<p>Star Serpents are Level 15 Elite Controllers with 286 HP. They’re a lot more
fond of melee combat than their cloud serpent cousins, and love to use
constricting attacks.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> is the same as the cloud serpent’s. The venom does a little less
ongoing damage, but also slows (save ends all). Their <strong>Righteous Coils</strong> (Reach
2 vs. Fortitude; minor action 1/round) do a bit of damage and grab. Grabbed
targets grant combat advantage to the star serpent, and it can move them without
needing to make Strength tests like the standard grapple rules say. There’s no
state limit to the number of grabbed victims; conceivably, the whole party could
be wrapped in the serpent’s coils. The escape DC is 27.</p>

<p>The couatl can <strong>Constrict</strong> (vs. Fortitude; minor action 1/round) a grabbed
target, dealing decent physical damage and dazing them for a turn.</p>

<p>The star serpent also has two magic encounter powers: <strong>Purifying Scream</strong>
(close burst 5 vs. Will) does psychic damage and also stuns the target for a
turn if it’s taking ongoing fire, poison or radiant damage. <strong>Couatl Radiance</strong>
grants the creature the insubstantial and phasing traits and allows it to shift
8 squares. The goal here is to pass through as many allies and enemies as
possible: every ally the couatl passes through regains 15 HP and can spend a
healing surge; every enemy suffers an attack vs. Will that, on a hit, deals both
immediate and ongoing fire and radiant damage. This nicely sets them up for a
Purifying Scream.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Couatls can be found hanging out with other creatures that share a similar
desire to oppose or guard against evil. They might also engage in a bit of smug
snake realpolitik and work alongside shadier allies with the goal of thwarting a
worse evil.</p>

<p>The book gives us two sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: a star serpen, 3 deva knights-errant, and 1 phoelarch warrior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 20: 2 cloud serpents, 2 marut executioners, 1 marut prosecutor.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I like couatls! This more ambiguous portrayal of them gives me plenty of hooks
to hang plots from, which I can’t say was something the purely Lawful Good
version did.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As we saw back in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/08/23/colossus.html">Colossus entry for the Monster Manual</a>, colossi are at
the top of the tech tree for traditional constructs, and only gods and
near-divine spellcasters have the power to create them. They’re the kind of
thing that was used as a weapon in the Dawn War. Well, here we learn that the
gods weren’t the only side of that war that could make colossi.</p>

<p>In the post linked above, I made a reference to the giant monsters from the
Shadow of the Colossus game. The primordial colossus we’re looking at here fits
them much better than the godforged variant from the first Manual.</p>

<p>Most primordial colossi were created at the time of the Dawn War, and being as
ageless as their creators they still exist today. Some roam the planes seeking
to fulfill the orders of their long-gone masters, but others lie dormant looking
for all the world like shattered ruins or broken parts of the landscape. When
someone approaches them, they rise and smash the intruder.</p>

<p>The magic that goes into a primordial colossus is a little wilder and less
controlled than the one that goes into the god-forged variant. The principles
behind it are such that a primordial colossus might be created <em>by accident</em>
in any event that causes the release of a massive amount of elemental
energy. This includes the awakening or destruction of a mighty elemental
being. It’s also possible for an epic spellcaster to acquire and perform the
ritual to create one of these constructs.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Once again we get a single stat block here, so let’s get right to it.</p>

<h3 id="primordial-colossus">Primordial Colossus</h3>

<p>This baby is a Huge Elemental Animate with the Construct keyword, and a Level 29
Elite Brute with 640 HP. It’s immune to disease, fear, poison and sleep, and has
a Variable Elemental Resistance 15 switchable 3 times per encounter. Its ground
speed is 10.</p>

<p>Primordial colossi really lean into that mechanic for composite energy
damage. They have an <strong>Elemental Presence</strong> aura (5) that deals 15 damage of the
“acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder” type to anyone caught inside. You
need resistance to all five types in order to not take full damage from it.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>slams</strong> do physical damage, but they likely prefer to use a
<strong>Colossal Slam</strong> maneuver (close blast 3 vs. AC), which does the same damage
over an area and triggers a secondary attack vs. Fortitude that does a bit of
extra five-type elemental damage.</p>

<p>When an enemy moves adjacent to the colossus, it can use a <strong>Reactive Kick</strong> as
a reaction, targetting Fortitude, doing a good bit of five-type damage, pushing
the target 4 squares and knocking it prone. This recharges once the colossus is
first bloodied.</p>

<p>Staying away does you no good, since it can throw <strong>Primordial Stones</strong> (Ranged
20 vs. Reflex) that do only a bit less damage than the slam and have a secondary
area attack (Close Burst 5 vs. Fortitude) which does that sweet five-type
damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The two sample encounters have primordial colossi guarding ancient ruins
alongside other similarly powerful apotropaics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 26: 1 primordial colossus, 2 great flameskulls, 1 slaughterstone
hammerer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 27: 1 primordial colossus, 1 primordial naga.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe an epic adventure centered on Far Realm opposition could have some
horrible aberrant secret guarded by both godforged and primordial colossi -
something so terrible the gods and primordials actually joined forces to
protect.</p>

<p>Mechanically, I find those Big Balls of Elemental Damage in the colossus’ stat
block to be a lot of fun. It’s so hard to resist you’d get the same result by
just using straight physical damage, but describing it this way reinforces the
elemental nature of the creature… and you get to see the look on your players’
faces as you announce they took acid, cold, fire lightning and thunder damage.</p>

<p>As far as I know both cockatrices and basilisks are based on the same vague lump
of medieval folklore about an animal that can turn you to stone. The exact name,
description and proportion of snake/lizard/chicken traits this animal has varies
in each specific story. D&amp;D, of course, turned each possible name for the same
thing into a totally different monster. They’ve been in the game since at least
the days of BECMI.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Cockatrices are bird-like monsters whose bite can turn a victim to stone. Unlike
a lot of other deadly creatures, though, they don’t actually seem to be
predators. Their petrification powers are a defense mechanism, which they will
use while trying to run away from whatever enemy threatens them. So yeah, you
could say cockatrices are a bit chicken.</p>

<p>Still, cockatrice lairs tend to have the little statue gardens common to
petrifying monsters, all likely made from predators who thought they could
handle it or from innocent creatures who had no idea whose lawn they were
stepping on. I imagine careful adventurers can just avoid the area entirely if
they see the statues, though there are reasons they would seek it out instead:
the freshly plucked feathers of a cockatrice can be used to brew a potion that
undoes petrification if applied within 24 hours. A single dose requires a whole
cockatrice’s worth of feathers, which in turn likely requires killing the beast.</p>

<p>Cockatrices are themselves immune to petrification, which makes them good pets
for medusas. The book also says other reptilians, like lizardfolk and yuan-ti,
also make use of them. They’re definitely easier to handle than a basilisk.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We only get a single stat block here, so let’s get right to it.</p>

<h3 id="cockatrice">Cockatrice</h3>

<p>This is a Small Natural Beast and a Level 5 Skirmisher with 63 HP and low-light
vision. It’s immune to petrification as discussed earlier, and has a ground
speed of 4 and a flight speed of 6 (clumsy). As a reminder, the Clumsy keyword
means the creature has a -4 to attacks when using that movement mode.</p>

<p>The cockatrice’s basic attack is its <strong>bite</strong>, which is kinda weak but triggers
a secondary attack vs. Fortitude. A hit there does no damage and slows the
victim (save ends). This worsens to Immobilized on the first failed save, and to
“permanent until cured” petrification on the second.</p>

<p>If an enemy moves adjacent to the cockatrice it can use <strong>Buffeting Wings</strong>
(recharge 4-6) as an interrupt, which allows it to bite the triggering enemy and
shift 3 squares.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Given their low level, cockatrices are likely to be the first petrifying
monsters a party encounters. They’re simple, but their main attack is scary
enough to make up for that. They could be made into higher-level threats if, in
addition to leveling them up, you made them more mobile and gave them an extra
special attack.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 5: 2 cockatrices and a trio of lizardfolk using
them as attack animals.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In any edition of D&amp;D it’s easy to get obsessed with its fiend taxonomy, but
there are always some creatures that end up slipping through its cracks. Take
chaos shards, for example. They form spontaneously at the edges of the terrible
maelstrom that exists at the border between the Elemental Chaos and the Abyss,
when the energies of those two planes clash in a particular way.</p>

<p>These crystalline entities are sapient, violent, and cruel. Since they don’t
have any biological needs to distract them, they’re quite content with roaming
around and blasting everything they see with elemental energies. I imagine they
give preference to targets that can scream and suffer.</p>

<p>Despite having themes tied to the Abyss, being Chaotic Evil, and even having
variable elemental resistance, these things are not demons. They do have some
sort of metaphysical connection to the Shard of Pure Evil at the bottom of the
Abyss, though. Legend has it that the most powerful chaos shards are splinters
of that legendary blight upon the universe.</p>

<p>Some wizards trap chaos shards for use as power sources, which I bet is not at
all dangerous or likely to result in death and suffering.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get a handful of stat blocks for shards covering from the mid-Heroic to the
mid-Paragon tiers. All are Medium Elemental Magical Beasts. They have
Darkvision, immunities to disease and poison, and a variable elemental
resistance similar to that of demons.</p>

<p>They’re all Artillery monsters, and their movement is fairly slow, though they
do fly. Most are strongly aspected towards a specific element, and have damaging
auras that get a bit stronger if their enemies are suffering from some condition.</p>

<h3 id="storm-shard">Storm Shard</h3>

<p>This Level 4 Artillery shard has 44 HP and aspected towards lightning and
thunder. Its ground and fly speeds are 3, and it projects a <strong>Static Storm</strong>
aura (2) that deals 3 lightning and thunder damage to those enemies caught
inside. This rises to 5 if the enemy is immobilized. They have the standard
senses and immunities, and their variable resistance is 5 and can be switched
once per encounter.</p>

<p>They fire <strong>Shock Bolts</strong> (vs. Fortitude) that do some lightning damage and
“strongly incentivize” the target to move: if they don’t end their next turn at
least 4 squares away from their current position, they take lightning damage
roughly equal to triple that of the initial attack.</p>

<p>If forced into melee, the shard attacks with <strong>Thunder Strikes</strong> (vs. Fortitude)
which deal thunder damage and knock the target prone if it’s bloodied.</p>

<p>When killed, storm shards explode! This <strong>Storm Shatter</strong> (Close Burst 3
vs. Fortitude) attack deals lightning and thunder damage, pushes the targets 3
squares, and deafens them (save ends).</p>

<p>A note on damage types: the expression “lightning and thunder damage” above
denotes an attack with a single damage roll that is of both types at
once. Targets use the smallest of their relevant elemental resistances against
this damage. In this specific example, someone with Lightning Resistance 10 and
Thunder Resistance 5 would subtract only 5 from the rolled damage. Someone that
resists only one of the component types takes full damage.</p>

<h3 id="death-shard">Death Shard</h3>

<p>Aspected towards necrotic energies, Death Shards are Level 8 Artillery with 71
HP. It has all the standard traits including Variable Resistance 5
(1/encounter), and also Necrotic Resistance 10. Its speed is 3.</p>

<p>This thing projects a <strong>Death Shadow</strong> aura (2) that deals necrotic damage to
enemies caught inside, which increases if the enemies are slowed. It fires
<strong>Death Bolts</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) that deal necrotic damage and slow
(save ends). In melee, it cuts you with a <strong>Razor Shard</strong>, a regular basic
attack dealing physical damage.</p>

<p>It’s a bit less volatile than the Storm Shard, but still dangerous: when hit by
a critical, it reacts with a <strong>Critical Fracture</strong> (close burst 2
vs. Fortitude), which deals necrotic damage and weakens.</p>

<p>If the death shard resists damage (i.e, if it’s hit with something covered by
its resistances), all of its attacks deal extra damage until the end of its next
turn. This trait is named <strong>Life to Death</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="flame-shard">Flame Shard</h3>

<p>These Level 12 Artillery monsters have an even 100 HP and are a bit more literal
about this whole artillery business than most of their compatriots. Their speed
is 4 and their variable resistance 10 (switchable twice per encounter).</p>

<p>The flame shard’s main ranged attack is <strong>Flame Burst</strong> (area burst 2 within 10
vs. Reflex) which is basically like an at-will fireball, though its damage is
rather low. In melee it stabs people with a <strong>Burning Shard</strong> that does fire
damage, and it projects a <strong>Heat Wave</strong> aura (2) that deals fire damage and
inflicts a -2 penalty against ongoing fire damage.</p>

<p>When killed they explode in a final attack that’s much like a Flame Burst
centered on themselves, and which also does ongoing fire damage (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="prismatic-shard">Prismatic Shard</h3>

<p>Living proof that “Radiant” doesn’t always mean “Good”… it can also mean “evil
disco ball”! These are Level 16 Artillery monsters with 123 HP. To the standard
list of shard immunities they add an immunity to <em>radiant damage</em>, making the
party’s divine characters very sad. Their variable resistance is 10 and can be
switched four times per encounter.</p>

<p>Their aura (2) is named <strong>Prismatic Corona</strong>. It does radiant damage and
inflicts a -2 penalty to all saving throws during made during the affected
enemy’s turn.</p>

<p>All of the Prismatic Shard’s attacks do radiant damage. The melee <strong>Prism
Flare</strong> (vs. Reflex) has nothing else going on for it. The <strong>Iridescent Bolt</strong>
(ranged 20 vs. Will) also blinds for a turn. Its <strong>Flashing Colors</strong> (close
burst 3 vs. Will; minor action) do no damage but daze (save ends). And the
<strong>Prismatic Shatter</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Will) attack it uses when it dies also
blinds (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>As I said before, chaos shards don’t have frail organic bodies to worry about,
so they can live solely for the fun of seeing people explode from their
elemental blasts. They hang out with creatures who are equally appreciative of
this highly refined form of entertainment, including slaads, demons, and certain
types of Internet troll.</p>

<p>They can also be summoned and controlled through elemental magic, which makes
them popular with certain spellcasters.</p>

<p>The sample encounters are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: 2 death shards, a bloodseep demon, and 2 evistros.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 1 prismatic shard, 3 blue slaads, and 1 green slaad.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Chaos shards fulfill the important mechanical niche of providing artillery
support for demons and slaads, since these monster types are all about melee and
tend to lack ranged firepower. They also further confuse the taxonomy of “things
from the Abyss”, something which I’m finding more and more interesting as I
progress through these monster books.</p>
