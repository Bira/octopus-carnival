<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Anyone who is familiar with the cosmology on 3e and earlier knows it tried
really hard to have an Official Outsider for every box in the alignment
grid. Devils were Lawful Evil, Demons (our current subject) were Chaotic
Evil. And then someone created the Daemons, which served the double purpose of
filling that Neutral Evil box on the chart and having every possible spelling of
a word be a different monster.</p>

<p>Mezzodaemons were a type of daemon. Since 4e doesn’t try to follow either of
those directives above, these monsters have dropped their extraneous vowels and
are now Mezzodemons, belonging to the “demon” category. They look like upright,
human sized, trident-wielding bugs.</p>

<p>These fellows are rather “quirky” as far as demons go, because their main thing
is greed, not unbriddled bloodlust. Rather than gathering in huge hordes and
going on omnicidal rampages, they establish hidden lairs in the world or in some
other plane and loot the surrounding region. Binding a mezzodemon to your
service is as easy as paying it. Of course, they still like killing. They just
think it’s even more fun when they get paid to do it and loot the bodies
afterwards. So basically, mezzodemons are demonic murderhobos. They are only on
the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Mezzodemons are Medium Elemental Humanoids (demons), and Level 11 Soldiers with
113 HP. They have Resist Poison 20, and variable resistance 10 switchable 2
times per encounter. They see with darkvision and run at speed 6.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 trident, and they also have an ability called
Skewering Tines. This is a trident attack that also does ongoing damage and
restrains (save ends). While the demon is restraining someone in this way, it
can’t make any trident attacks.</p>

<p>They can also breathe poison on enemies in a Close Blast 3, targeting Fortitude
and doing both immediate and ongoing poison damage to any enemy they it. This
recharges on a 5-6, and the fact that it’s a selective attack suggests
interesting things. Maybe it’s a series of targetted squirts instead of a cloud?
Or maybe it is a cloud, but the poison is made of pure evil and anyone who hangs
out with mezzodemons is likely to be immune to it.</p>

<p>Mezzodemons are clearly meant to be team players. Maybe they engage your
defenders and restrain them while their buddies attack your back line. Or maybe
they do that to the mobile strikers instead, allowing those buddies to more
effectively gang up on them.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 11: 2 mezzodemons working as a mercenary for a
party of 2 drow warriors and 1 drow arachnomancer. This is a nasty combination
indeed, because those warriors just love to have restrained PCs to gang up on.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Mezzodemons are not too exotic number-wise, but they have quite a bit of
personality and a reason to hang out with any evil group who can afford to pay
them. They work both as early opposition in a demon focused paragon arc, or as
“spice” to other evil factions. I like them more than goristros, that’s for
sure.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>I think I’ve finally figured out what distinguishes a humanoid from a magical
beast in 4e. Does it have hands? If it does it’s a humanoid, if it doesn’t it’s
a magical beast.</p>

<p>That’s the only explanation that makes sense for why a Marilith is a Large
Elemental <em>Humanoid</em> (demon), despite being a six-armed lady with the lower body
of a snake. With succubi having become devils (more on that later), mariliths
have the distinction of being the most human-looking of demons. Some people even
find them sexy. Yes, I’m talking about you, dear Monster Musume fans.</p>

<p>These demons have been a part of the game for a long time, and are iconic enough
to exist both in the Monster Manual and on the Monster Vault. The two versions
are mostly identical, but we’ll still look at them separately here.</p>

<p>Mariliths are among some of the most intelligent demons at Int 14, losing only
to the Glabrezu in that field. Their appetite for destruction takes on a more
refined shape than usual: they are obsessed with martial skill, so they look for
tough opponents to fight and tend to take their gear as trophies. They store
these trophies in secret stashes on the Abyss or in the world, presumably to
prevent other demons from stealing them. It seems to me that looting such a
stash is a sure way to incur their wrath, which makes it a nice hook. Yuan-Ti
who turn to demonology are big fans of mariliths.</p>

<p>Mariliths are usually armed with six swords, one for each hand, though you could
mix and match the weapons if you wanted. In previous editions the weapons would
sometimes take a backseat to their many spell-like abilities, but here they are
definitely the main event.</p>

<p>Both versions of the Marilith are Level 24 Elite Skirmishers: they’re pretty
high up in the demonic hierarchy, such as it is. Their skill list backs this up:
they’re trained in Perception, Bluff, Insight, Intimidate, and Stealth. Yes,
mariliths can socialize if they feel the need. Their descriptions in other
editions tend to describe them as excellent tactitians and commanders, and this
definitely fits this incarnation as well.</p>

<h2 id="marilith-monster-manual">Marilith (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The MM Marilith has 440 HP, Darkvision, and Variable Resistance 20 (switchable
3x/encounter). They move at Speed 8.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a scimitar, which is quite weak due to the math bug but
has the High Critical property. Their most commonly used attack is Shroud of
Steel, which allows them to make two scimitar attacks and use the other weapons
to parry, granting itself a +4 bonus to AC for a turn.</p>

<p>Whenever an adjacent enemy misses the marilith with a melee attack, it can make
a free scimitar attack against then. And twice per encounter (once at the start,
once after being bloodied) they can perform the Weapon Dance, which allows them
to make six scimitar attacks, shifting 1 square between each one.</p>

<h2 id="marilith-mv">Marilith (MV)</h2>

<p>As stated earlier, the MV Marilith is very similar to the MM one. It has 436 HP
instead of 440 and slightly different defenses, but retains the extensive skill
list.</p>

<p>The main changes are in its attacks. The damage on the basic scimitar attack has
been fixed, but it no longer has High Critical. Shroud of Steel now gives it a
+6 to AC. It is otherwise identical.</p>

<h2 id="tactics-and-encounters">Tactics and Encounters</h2>

<p>Fighting a Marilith is much like fighting a blender. Ranged attacks are much
safer than melee combat against them, but they’re fast, smart and will have
backup from other demons when encountered. You could give it some out-of-combat
rituals or abilities that allow it to prepare the terrain in advance, adding
obscuring or blocking features that limit the PC’s ability to stay away and
attack it from range. Or perhaps it just chooses a battlefield that already has
all of that and baits the PCs into it.</p>

<p>The sample encounter in the MM is level 23, a marilith and four hezrou. The toad
goons are just the thing to keep the fighters occupied while their boss slithers
towards the squishies.</p>

<p>Broken Jar was abandoned at the gates of a far-off monastery when he was a baby,
and was raised by monks his whole life. This particular monastery sends its
initiates out as mendicants once their basic training is completed, with the
intent that they return humbler and wiser after a while.</p>

<p>So it was with Broken Jar, who gladly started his journey. He met many of his
fellow monks who were on their way back, having judged they saw enough of the
world. He himself never quite got to that point. He always looked to the next
hill and longed to see what lay beyond it. New places to see, new people to
meet, new villains to punch. And so Broken Jar kept wandering.</p>

<p>Truth be told, he’s not quite sure how he got here. This place is so different
from the lands of his childhood that he doesn’t think he could have gotten here
with just a few weeks of hiking. Is he even in the same continent? The same
world? Finding the answer to that is sure to be fun, and in the meantime there’s
so much more to see around here! This wanderer is in absolutely no rush to go
back home.</p>

<p>Broken Jar’s specialty is fighting unarmed, or with a staff. As he is now, his
damage falls short of what a Weapon Master Knight can manage, but he does have
plenty of interesting tricks to use and can do cutting damage with while unarmed
thanks to his claws. Earned points should likely go towards increased combat
skills and power-ups that add to his unarmed damage.</p>

<p>The catfolk racial template I used for him is more similar to the one I wrote up
for Elder Scrolls <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html">Khajit</a> than the one in DF: Adventurers, which is really
quite “busy” and burnened by typical “cat” psychological disadvantages that
don’t really fit this particular character.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Every time you kill a demon, its soul is sent screaming back to the Abyss, where
it will eventually reincarnate as a new demon. However, sometimes the process
goes wrong, and a bunch of demon souls bump into each other on the way to the
Abyss and fuse into a big clump. This katamari of evil can’t reincarnate
properly, and instead rises as an undead demon. And this is how immoliths are
made!</p>

<p>Immoliths look like pillars of fire topped by a demonic skull. Many different
skeletal limbs emerge from their flames, likely belonging to the original demons
that make it up. As undead demons, their hate of the living is double-plus-big,
and they’re as likely to be found alongside powerful undead like liches and
vampires as they are with other demons. They’re only statted up in the Monster
Manual.</p>

<p>Immoliths are Large Elemental Magical Beasts (demon, fire, undead), and Level 15
Controllers with 153 HP and defenses a point or two lower than what you’d
expect. Interestingly, they lack darkvision, but I imagine that’s not needed
when you’re walking bonfire.</p>

<p>Immoliths are immune to fire, disease and poison. They have Variable Resistance
15 (switchable once per encounter), and Radiant Vulnerability 10. The intense
heat emanating from their bodies works as an Aura 1 that deals 10 fire damage to
anyone starting their turns within it.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 4 claw that does both immediate and ongoing fire
damage. Instead of that they can use a Fiery Grab against Large or smaller
targets. This combines the claw attack with a grab that pulls the victim
adjacent to the immolith (and into its aura). The demon can grab up to five
creatures this way, and while they’re grabbed they lose any resistance they have
to fire. Did you think you were safe just because you were a tiefling, fire
genasi or fire sorcerer?</p>

<p>As a minor action, the immolith can inflict a Deathfire Curse on someone as a
Ranged 10 attack that targets Will. On a hit the target is slowed (save ends),
and after they save from that they’ll take ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Also as a minor action, though only once per round, it can restore 5 HP to all
undead in a Close Burst 5, including itself.</p>

<p>It’s not inconceivable that one of these could have the entire party grabbed and
taking ongoing fire damage from their aura. People who try to run would be
slowed by the Deathfire Curse, and likely by the immolith’s buddies.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 14: one immolith, 2 vrocks, 4 mezzodemons, and 6
horde ghouls. Since it appears both mezzodemons and vrocks have means to limit a
character’s mobility, my analysis above checks out.</p>

<p>Hezrou a relative rarity among demons in that they like to serve. Whether their
master is a stronger demon or a mortal summoner, they will happily obey orders
as long as they’re given opportunities to kill things.</p>

<p>Hezrou are Large Elemental Humanoids (demons). Their muscular frames are all
hunched over, they have the heads of toads, and their skins are eternally
covered in putrescent slime. In fact, judging from the illustration in the books
the very flesh of the hezrou is eternally rotting, exposing bone in places, even
though they’re not undead.</p>

<p>Hezrou exist in both books. We’ll take a look at them separately.</p>

<h2 id="hezrou-monster-manual">Hezrou (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>Monster Manual Hezrou are Level 22 Brutes with 225 HP, darkvision, and variable
resistance 20 that can be switched twice per encounter. Their noxious stench
manifests as an Aura 2 that gives all enemies inside it a -2 penalty to
attacks. If the demon is bloodied, enemies in the aura are also weakened
(ruptured internal pus pockets!). They run with Speed 6.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 slam, but they also have a slightly less
damaging Reach 2 bite and the ability to use both as a standard action, which
brings their damage in line with the expected for their level like we’ve seen
with other multi-attacking regular brutes. These demons also ignore difficult
terrain, seeming to phase through it despite being otherwise solid.</p>

<p>They’re trained in Stealth and quite agile, so they could end up being quite
sneaky… if you can’t smell them coming first.</p>

<p>The proposed encounter is level 22, two hezrou, a deathpriest hierophant, and 5
abyssal ghoul myrmidons. Servants of Orcus, basicaly, with the hierophant
calling the shots.</p>

<h2 id="hezrou-monster-vault">Hezrou (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The MV Hezrou shares many of the traits of its MM cousin, with a few important
differences. It’s slightly tougher at 254 HP, and a lot stinkier. Its stench
does 10 poison damage to enemies caught in the area instead of merely inflicting
a penalty, and this rises to 20 damage when the thing is bloodied.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is still a slam, which is entirely responsible for its baseline
damage now. The bite is still there as a Recharge 4-6 attack that does about 50%
more damage than the slam.</p>

<p>The MV Hezrou also loses its Stealth training.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Hezrou might not be the most badass demons around, but they sure have a lot of
character. “Stinky toad demon who is happy with its lot in life as a goon” is
enough to make it memorable in a whole plane of creatures that smoulder with
generic rage.</p>
