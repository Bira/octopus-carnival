<p>Like Angels, Archons in 4e are significantly different from the monsters bearing
the same name in earlier editions. In most of those they used to be Lawful Good
angels, but here they are elemental creatures who made up the bulk of the
Primordial armies during their war with the gods.</p>

<p>Back at the start of the Dawn War, the Primordials primarily used giants and
titanic elemental beasts against the gods. These were powerful but few in
number, and so effectiveness against the countless angels and exarchs of the
divine host was limited. Eventually the Primordials would learn to forge archons
from “raw” elementals, putting both sides on a more even footing.</p>

<p>Archons are militaristic and well-versed in tactics despite being Chaotic Evil,
which can easily be explained by two important traits of 4e’s alignment system:
1) “chaos” here means <em>ruin</em> instead of <em>randomness</em> and 2) Chaotic Evil is the
alignment of Team Primordial, and these beings are definitely still on Team
Primordial. These days they can be found serving as muscle for a variety of
similarly-disposed elemental beings, or protecting sites of importance to the
imprisoned primordials.</p>

<p>Like Angels, Archons are paragon-tier monsters. The Monster Manual presents fire
and ice archons, but also says there are a bunch of other types. Earth and Air
are obvious, but you also have more “exotic” types like Slime, Storm, and
Crystal. A typical archon force is composed of a jumble of different archon
types, though without strong leadership they’re prone to infighting.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault text further stresses their leadership skill and tactical
prowess, and pictures them as less prone to infighting than what the Monster
Manual said. It contains four Archon stat blocks: Earth, Fire, Water and Ice.</p>

<p>Archons generally look like humanoids sculpted out of their element, wearing
fancy (and spiky) military gear.</p>

<h2 id="fire-archons">Fire Archons</h2>

<p>Fire Archons are quite fast at Speed 8, are immune to disease and poison, and
have Resist 30 Fire. That last bit means you can theoretically pull a Dark
Schneider on them and prove your awesomeness by killing them with fire. Also of
note is the fact that none of them are particularly vulnerable to cold.</p>

<h3 id="fire-archon-emberguard">Fire Archon Emberguard</h3>

<p>This dude is a Level 12 Brute clad in plate and wielding a greataxe. They have
151 HP and somewhat subpar non-armor defenses. They have an aura that causes
fire damage to anyone adjacent to them. Their attacks appear to suffer from some
editorial issues, as they’re even less accurate they than should be by the early
monster math. In any case, they have a basic axe strike that does a combination
of physical and fire damage with the High Crit property, and a Recharge 3-6
version that also causes ongoing fire damage.</p>

<p>I addition to fixing their accuracy and damage, I’d suggest just adding the
ongoing fire damage to their basic melee attack.</p>

<h3 id="fire-archon-blazesteel">Fire Archon Blazesteel</h3>

<p>These Level 19 Soldiers are the shock troopers of the primordial armies, and can
also be found working for efreets and fire titans. They have 182 HP, and their
Will is substantially weaker than their other defenses. Blazesteels (weird name)
fight with flaming scimitars that deal physical and fire damage and mark enemies
they hit. They don’t have any powers that exploit the mark, but they do get to
make two attacks and deal extra fire damage against enemies that grant them
combat advantage. This means they do well in a team that includes skirmishers
who are good at flanking.</p>

<p>Oh, and they blow up once bloodied and once again when dead, catching everyone
in a Close Burst 2 in the ensuing conflagration and dealing ongoing fire damage.</p>

<h3 id="fire-archon-ash-disciple">Fire Archon Ash Disciple</h3>

<p>The ash disciple is a Level 20 Artillery archon, who is a bit odd in that all
its ranged attacks are encounter powers. There’s a Rain of Fire that deals
ongoing damage (or half damage on a miss); a Flame Wave that pushes and deals 10
ongoing fire damage; and a Cinder Burst that blinds. It’s only at-will ability
is a funky teleport that makes it appear out of a nearby fire creature (like
another fire archon).</p>

<p>Once its encounter powers are gone, the ash disciple will have to join the
melee with its weak fists, and be content in the knowledge that it will blow up
when it dies with an explosion similar to its Cinder Burst. This will happen
fairly fast, because as an artillery monster the flame disciple has only 150 HP.</p>

<p>I’d strongly consider adding an at-will single-target ranged attack to this
monster.</p>

<h3 id="monster-vault-fire-archon">Monster Vault Fire Archon</h3>

<p>Being the sole fire archon in the Monster Vault, it doesn’t have a fancy
name. It’s a level 13 skirmisher with 130HP and only Resist 20 fire, which leads
me to think we can lower the resistance of the MM archons to that level. Also
unlike the MM archons, this one <em>is</em> vulnerable to cold: taking cold damage
prevents it from shifting for a turn.</p>

<p>It attacks with a scimitar that does fire damage, can shift up to half its speed
as a move action, and has a Blaze Step encounter power where it shifts its whole
speed and leaves a trail of fire on the ground. This trail deals 10 fire damage
to whoever crosses it and lasts until the end of the fight.</p>

<p>I like this one. A simple monster that feels fiery and skirmisher-y.</p>

<h2 id="ice-archons">Ice Archons</h2>

<p>Like fire archons, but with ice. Speed 6 with ice walk, immune to disease and
poison, and with Resist 30 to cold.</p>

<h3 id="ice-archon-hailscourge">Ice Archon Hailscourge</h3>

<p>A plate-clad icy ninja who hops around throwing ice shuriken. Level 16
artillery. It can throw two of those shuriken on its turn, or it can conjure a
Recharge 5-6 hailstorm that has a variable area burst radius and does half
damage on a miss. If a PC tries to tag it with a ranged, close, or area attack
it can summon an ice shield once per encounter that will negate 20 damage from
that attack.</p>

<p>Simple but interesting. The only thing preventing it from being cool are the
usual math issues and the archon-specific editing problems. Be sure to correct
for those if you want to use it.</p>

<h3 id="ice-archon-rimehammer">Ice Archon Rimehammer</h3>

<p>A level 19 Soldier who fights like a Brute. His huge ice maul slows on a hit,
and deals extra damage to slowed targets. Its most soldierly trait is an aura
that freees the ground around it and makes it difficult terrain to enemies.</p>

<p>I feel the rimehammer would work best as a brute, since its arsenal is pretty
similar to that of the Aboleth Lasher, who is a brute. In fact I’d say the
rimehammer is <em>less</em> dangerous than the lasher, despite being 2 levels higher.</p>

<h3 id="ice-archon-frostshaper">Ice Archon Frostshaper</h3>

<p>Like Elsa, but evil. A Level 20 Controller (Leader), it has a large aura that
gives Regeneration 10 to any cold creature inside and turns the ground into
difficult terrain for enemies. Its basic melee attack is an ice blade that does
cold damage, and it throws ice javelins that slow for a turn. It also has an Icy
Burst area attack that slows on a hit but still does half damage on a hit, and
recharges whenever the frostshaper hits with a melee attack.</p>

<p>This suggests its strategy should be to mostly fight in melee and use bursts to
interfere with more distant fighting.</p>

<h3 id="monster-vault-ice-archon">Monster Vault Ice Archon</h3>

<p>This level 13 soldier has 135 HP, a cold resistance of only 20, and takes a -2
penalty to all defenses for a turn when hit with fire damage. It attacks with an
mace that does cold damage on a hit and applies a mark to everyone within 2
squares whether it hits or not. If a marked enemy tries to flout the mark (i.e,
make an attack that doesn’t include the archon as a target) it gets smacked with
an attack that does cold damage and weakens.</p>

<p>Now <em>that’s</em> a proper soldier monster.</p>

<h2 id="other-monster-vault-archons">Other Monster Vault Archons</h2>

<h3 id="earth-archon">Earth Archon</h3>

<p>This level 12 brute has 149 HP, earth walk, tremorsense, and is immune to
petrification in addition to the usual disease and poison. If it takes thunder
damage, it’s slowed for a turn.</p>

<p>It attacks with a stone warhamer for Brute damage, and has a powerful Avalanche
charge that does more damage and knocks the target prone even on a miss. This
last one recharges once it’s bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="water-archon">Water Archon</h3>

<p>A level 14 controller with 140 HP, a swim speed, and 20 acid resistance. It’s
slowed for a turn if it takes cold damage.</p>

<p>Its staff slows the target for a turn on a hit, and it also has an at-will
Whirlpool power that can hit everyone on a Close Burst 3 and slide them up to 3
squares. It’s an hilarious way to mess up the party’s carefully orchestrated
formation.</p>

<h3 id="archon-encounters">Archon Encounters</h3>

<p>There’s only one Monster Manual section with suggested encounters for all
archons. The general theme is “pair fire archons with other fire monsters” and
“pair ice archons with other ice monsters”.</p>

<p>I say it might be more interesting to mix up the elements, and have a
mixed-archon force face the PCs. That way it will be harder for them to protect
against all the types of elemental damage involved. The Monster Vault bears this
out with its presentation of a multi-element sentai team of similar
levels. There are no “suggested encounter” sections in the MV, but it’s obvious
you’re supposed to meet all four of its archons together.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I find archons to be serviceable minions of the Primordials in concept, but the
Monster Manual batch seems to suffer from issues beyond those that can be
explained by early monster math. All of their attacks are too inaccurate, and
they generally work in a somewhat odd manner (like the ash disciple lacking an
at-will ranged attack). I’m guessing these were some of the first monsters
written for Fourth Edition.</p>

<p>Comparing the archons from both books side by side makes the MM ones seem
particularly janky, since the Monster Vault gives us a well-oiled elemental
sentai team where each archon has a very simple stat block that nevertheless
showcases what its role is supposed to be all about.</p>

<p>The one thing I prefer in the MM archons is their lack of vulnerability to their
opposiing element. It makes sense that they wouldn’t be vulnerable to each other
if they’re meant to work together, and it lets you spring a little “gotcha”
moment on PCs who think they’re clever for thinking fire pokemon are weak
against ice.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>…and I gather it’s kind of a big deal. There’s quite a few “Actual Play”
streams following the same format, and I’ve seen a few posts by different people
commenting on how it brought a large influx of new players to the RPG hobby in
general and to D&amp;D in particular.</p>

<p>The tone of these posts has varied. A couple were all about how the show sets
somewhat unrealistic expectations on new players because the cast and game are
so awesome. One, by a genuine scion of the Old School, went the other way and
lamented that the hobby was truly damned if Critical Role is what Kids These
Days consider a good game<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I guess I’m somewhere in the middle? I’ve been at this long enough to know every
group is going to have its own style, and I’ve been burned by enough flame wars
to accept that a given style isn’t bad because it’s different from mine.</p>

<p>For example, I’ve come to accept that uncut videos of 5-hour game sessions
aren’t my preferred medium for following other people’s games. Give me a
well-written and well-summarized text report any day of the week! Still, the
videos I did watch did provide me with at least one take-away I can use in my
own games: do the voices!</p>

<p>Sure, the Critical Role group is entirely composed of trained voice actors, but
even if you’re not one of them you can still add a little something to every
NPC. Perhaps a simple but distinctive mannerism, or a slight change in
pitch. Tiny changes that anyone can do and which might be enough to make your
characters more memorable. I used to do that a lot more in the past, and now
that I see how effective it can be for people on the receiving end I’m going to
start doing it again.</p>

<p>If you’re a player, then you can do the same for your own PC. At the very least
it will help others to know when you’re speaking in and out of character.</p>

<p>Watching the videos themselves is kinda fun: you can see that this is a
well-oiled group that has been playing for a while. They obviously enjoy each
other’s company and are very much into the game. Watching them in action
sometimes kinda makes me want to join the group, impossible though it might
be. I don’t often get to be a player.</p>

<p>I get why people say it feels railroaded, though I don’t necessarily agree with
them. You’re watching a full game happen but have neither any input on how it
develops, nor any access to the GM’s notes. There’s no real way to know how much
material<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> goes unused, nor how much is created between sessions or improvised
on the spot in response to player’s decisions.</p>

<p>Of course, my inner grognard can’t help but notice that while Matt Mercer is
very skilled, he does have a different style from mine. I can’t help but think
there are a few things I would do differently if I was in his position.</p>

<p>The first is that when a PC attacks an enemy he describes everything himself,
from the PC’s actions to the monster’s reaction. The only exception seems to be
when a PC takes down a boss. Years of playing Exalted have hardwired me to
always let players describe their own actions, thankyouverymuch.</p>

<p>The second is that he interprets every hit in combat as resulting in physical
wounds, which leads to some quite gory descriptions at times. Sometimes I
actually start to pity some of the high-HP monsters they fight. I like systems
such as GURPS or Dragon Heresy because they make a clearer distinction about
what’s a wound and what isn’t.</p>

<p>There’s a third thing, but you didn’t pass your Perception check for this
paragraph so you don’t see it.</p>

<p>In the end I guess I’ll probably resort to things like <a href="http://www.projectderailed.com/critical-role-recap/">this recap site</a> when
I want to keep up with the Critical Role campaign. It’s not quite the same
thing, but it does the job of conveying what happened in a session a lot faster.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Let’s Read Hell’s Rebels! This post will cover Part 3 of the
second adventure, Turn of the Torrent. <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/11/07/hells-rebels-2-part-2.html">Part 2</a> had the PCs help out Octavio
Sabinus rescue his captured men, in addition to performing several other
missions that improved the standing of the Ravens in the eyes of the population
and rewarded them with favors from other groups.</p>

<p>Following the format of the first adventure, in Part 3 we get back to a big ol’
dungeon raid. There’s not much direct opposition to Thrune here, but
successfully clearing this place out will secure a bigger hideout for the
Ravens, increasing the organization’s maximum power.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-lucky-bones">Part 3: Lucky Bones</h2>

<p>The dungeon in question lies beneath the ruins of a gambling hall called the
Lucky Bones. Thirty years ago, the Torrent Knights found out was a front for
gang of thieves named the Grey Spiders. The Spiders worshipped Norgorber<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and
were into a whole lot of bad stuff, from drug running to kidnapping to slavery.</p>

<p>The gang assassinated the leader of the Order in an attempt to keep them at bay,
but it backfired. The Knights raided the hideout and took the Grey Spiders
down. Afterwards the Torrent’s new leader sealed the place up without further
investigating it, an unorthodox decision. Turns out he and a few cronies
intended to go back to the place at a later time and take all of the Spiders’
loot for themselves. They were found out and arrested for corruption before they
could act on this plan, but the Order never unsealed the Lucky Bones out of
shame for the whole episode. The casino has long become a ruin, but the complex
beneath it remains sealed to this day.</p>

<p>Lictor Octavio will share this story with the PCs if they get on his good side
by completing the rescue mission without causing too much chaos.</p>

<h3 id="lucky-bones-overview">Lucky Bones: Overview</h3>

<p>The dungeon beneath the Lucky Bones is quite large and complicated when compared
to the Fantasmagorium in Adventure 1. Pathfinder’s writing style is verbose and
so am I, so I’ll take a page from Gygax’s manual of style and make an effort to
condense things as much as possible here. It will still take multiple posts to
cover the whole dungeon, but I hope you’ll end up with a fairly complete idea of
what lies inside.</p>

<p>Before describing the dungeon itself, the book gives us some background on the
three former leaders of the Spiders: a tiefling sorcerer named Baccus, a
halfling rogue named Lorelu, and a wererat cleric named Hei-Fen. The first two
died during the raid, while Hei-Fen managed to escape to the neighboring city of
Vyre. She still lives there and will make an appearance as a villain in the next
adventure.</p>

<p>The Lucky Bones consists of a surface building and two basements. The surface
level holds nothing of interest. The upper basement actually consists of two
“sub-levels”, separated by the Torrent seal. One is currently occupied by a cult
of Mahatallah<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> made up of changelings (who in Golarion are the children of
hags and mortals, and not the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/19/changelings-dfrpg.html">shapeshifting people from Eberron</a>). The other
is behind the seal and haunted by the restless spirits of the people who died
there.</p>

<p>The lower basement is completely submerged. Its current occupants are a team of
skum sent by an aboleth necromancer to spy on the city. They have several
sort-of-tamed underwater monsters helping them out, and have captured a squad of
sea elf rangers who came here to search for their missing ally
Shensen<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. There’s a magical pump in here that can be reactivated to drain
most of the water, but doing so requires clearing the dungeon first. In other
words: yay, underwater adventure!</p>

<p>The PCs could learn about the Lucky Bones as soon as they complete the rescue
mission from Part 2, which means Part 3 could happen concurrently with the other
Part 2 missions.</p>

<p>But before they go there, they might get ambushed!</p>

<h3 id="a-drunk-in-the-slums">A Drunk in the Slums</h3>

<p>The leader of that changeling cult happens to be Luculla Gens, a regular of the
Tooth and Nail tavern whom the PCs might have already met (she’s described in
the same section that describes the tavern). Luculla frequents the place to fish
for information and is likely to overhear any plans the party discusses in the
tavern’s common room. If she overhears Octavio talking about the Lucky Bones or
otherwise comes to think the PCs are a threat to her, she will send an assassin
after them.</p>

<p>The assassin is a Faceless Stalker named Maglap. Faceless Stalkers are like
doppelgangers but stronger, with good grappling skills and a blood-draining
attack they can use on people they’ve grappled. Maglap will approach the PCs
looking like a drunken sailor and use the element of surprise to
attack. Interrogating the stalker is only possible with some form of magical
compulsion. He knows a few details about the cultist-occupied parts of the
dungeon and about Luculla’s true identity.</p>

<p>Learning about her early gives the party a XP bonus. Maglap also offers an
alternative way for PCs to learn about the Lucky Bones if they manage to
alienate Octavio.</p>

<h3 id="lucky-bones-surface">Lucky Bones: Surface</h3>

<p>The surface level of the Lucky Bones has nothing interesting in it. PCs can find
a trail through the rubble with an easy perception roll, leading to a
fireplace. That fireplace contains a secret passage that requires a very hard
Perception check to find, though hearing the story of the raid from Octavio (or
interrogating Maglap) gives a big enough bonus to make it easy. The passage
leads into a sort of basement anteroom (<strong>C1</strong>) that’s filled with disgusting
trash and guarded by three teenage <del>mutant ninja</del> othyugs. A trapped and
locked door leads from here into the hideout proper.</p>

<h3 id="lucky-bones-cultist-hideout">Lucky Bones: Cultist Hideout</h3>

<p>The Cultist Hideout occupies the southern half of the level 1 map. Ceilings here
are 8 feet high on average. The walls drip with moisture, and the doors are all
swollen with it. They no longer lock, and opening or closing them requires a
Strength test. The changelings just leave them open all the time.</p>

<p>This level is also completely riddled with secret doors, which are in much
better condition. Spotting them from the concealed side is almost impossible, so
the cultists don’t know most of them exist. They mostly link rooms that can be
reached by more obvious paths, and will become a lot more useful when the PCs
take over the place and have to defend it.</p>

<p>There is pretty much no way to explore this place stealthily. The “brutal raid”
approach is preferred, and the enemies here should certainly react as if that’s
what the PCs are doing.</p>

<p><strong>C2. Living Quarters</strong>: Accessible from C1. Four cultists are lounging around
and will immediately attack the PCs when they get here from C1. They’ll attempt
to capture the PCs alive using <em>wands of hold person</em> and nets, and when one of
them falls the rest will use <em>potions of invisibility</em> to run towards the temple
in C8 and warn their mistress. Six other cultists are currently offsite - if the
PCs retreat before clearing the hideout, those six will be recalled as
reinforcements and they’ll barricade the door to C1.</p>

<p><strong>C3. Maglap’s Quarters</strong>: Accessible from C2. Pile of rags on the floor, lots
of clothing (for disguises) hung on the walls. Among them is a <em>cloak of the
manta ray</em>. If the party didn’t meet Maglap before, he will be here and will
help the cultists on C2 in case of a fight.</p>

<p><strong>C4. Pit Trap:</strong> Accessible from C2. A 20-foot deep pit lined with shards of
broken glass. The pit is open and obvious but the ledges around it will swing
down 6 seconds after anyone steps on them, dropping victims into the pit. Hidden
switches in the hallways to either side can be used to deactivate trap if
found. A secret passage leads to the bottom of the pit in C13.</p>

<p><strong>C5. Guard Post:</strong> Accessible from C4. Elgadazum (advanced bearded devil) is
bound to guard this place and is bored out of his beard. The devil will strike
up a conversation with any PCs until they either attack him or try to open the
door to C6 (from which muffled knocks and cries can be heard). Elgadazum warns
Luculla telepathically when a fight starts and teleports to her when severely
injured.</p>

<p><strong>C6. Cell:</strong> Accessible from C5. Two frightened teen boys await sacrifice
here. Secret passage leads to C8. Rescuing the prisoners brings a XP reward and
enhances popular support for the Ravens. Luculla and bodyguards will arrive here
through the secret passage to move the prisoners to C9 30-60 seconds after
Elgadazum runs away from C5, so the boss fight might happen in this cramped
10-by-15-foot room if the PCs linger here. Fun(TM)!</p>

<p><strong>C7. Sealed Door:</strong> Accessible from C4. Huge iron door, locked with a complex
mechanical lock and an arcane ward. Leads to the Haunted Opium Den, which we’ll
discuss next post.</p>

<p><strong>C8. Temple to Norgorber</strong>: Accessible from C4. Pillars, sacrificial altar,
walls covered in creepy prayers. Luculla and two cultists work to rededicate
this temple to Mahatallah. They will be joined by any survivors from the
previous rooms for a last stand. If the party bypassed Elgadazum, he’ll likely
teleport here after the fight has started.</p>

<p><strong>C9. Luculla’s Chambers:</strong> Accessible from C8. <em>Glyph of warding</em> trap on
threshold. Cot with furs and feather mattress, desk full of books and
scrolls. On the desk are also a basin made from a gold-plated skull and filled
with unholy water, and a statuette of Mahatallah with a secret compartment
containing a <em>scroll of raise dead</em>. The statuette also has some monetary
value. If Luculla managed to move the prisoners without running into the PCs,
they’re also here.</p>

<h3 id="notes-on-opposition-and-treasure">Notes On Opposition and Treasure</h3>

<p>Each cultist is a Cleric 1/Rogue 2. They wear leather, fight with nets and their
claws, and know a few minor healing and defensive spells. More dangerous are
their magic items: each carries a <em>wand of hold person</em> with 10 charges and a
<em>potion of invisibility</em>. For a GURPS conversion, you could start with the
Skirmisher template and add the necessary Power Investiture and cleric spells,
along with Sharp Claws and likely a bit more Striking ST.</p>

<p>Elgadazum is a by-the-book Bearded Devil, with increased attributes. Generic
Universal Eggplant has a <a href="https://enragedeggplant.blogspot.com/2018/01/monster-bearded-devil-barbazu.html">version</a> of that monster here, though it should
probably be further beefed up for Dungeon Fantasy.</p>

<p>Luculla is a level 7 cleric, wearing +1 protective gear (armor, ring of
protection, cloak of resistance). She has a bunch of healing potions and a
<em>scroll of glyph of warding</em>, which means she’ll set a trap if she knows the PCs
are coming. She also wears a mundane but valuable ceremonial mask (which might
be a power item in DF). Luculla is quite weak in melee, but her spell loadout
includes <em>summon monster IV</em> along with a bunch of curses and healing
spells. For Dungeon Fantasy, start with the Wizard template, replace Magery with
Clerical Investment/Power Investiture and layer on as many curse-like spells as
you can fit.</p>

<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p>Pathfinder characters are supposed to be about level 6 when they get here, and
depending on how large the boss fight is they might need that <em>scroll of raise
dead</em> right away. Dungeon Fantasy delvers are less likely to need it, though by
now the fights should be getting challenging for them as well.</p>

<p>Clearing the hideout in one run still leaves the six changeling cultists who
weren’t there. The book doesn’t really say what happens to them. The way I see
it, the most likely outcome is that the surviving cultists eventually figure out
what happened and run away. They’ll either not be a problem anymore on this
adventure, or might end up linking with other infernal-themed opposition further
down the line. It’s not like there will be a lack of such groups in this
adventure path.</p>

            <p>This article is part of a series! Go <a href="https://killsixbilliondemons.com/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>In a substantial change from monsters bearing the same name the past, Fourth
Edition angels have winged humanoid upper bodies (with “feminine or masculine
features”), and their lower bodies trail off into flowing energy. Many believe
they were created by the gods, but the truth is they arose from the stuff of the
Astral Sea when that plane first came into existence. If this process was
started by the gods, it was entirely unconscious.</p>

<p>When the gods went to war against the Primordials, the angels pledged their
service to the deities that most closely matched their individual beliefs. You
see, Angels are a rather diverse lot, with a listed alignment of “Any”. So yeah,
Tiamat and Gruumsh have evil angels on their payroll. You can even find angels
working as mercenaries, serving people whose causes they find agreeable and who
can meet their price.</p>

<p>Angels are the first MM monster to also show up on the <em>Monster Vault</em>, where
the lore was changed to make then mostly mercenaries who only ocasionally join
up with specific gods in a more definitive manner. Here they’re Unaligned and
make being as generic as possible in looks and personality a point of
pride. Personally, I prefer the Monster Manual version with additional
embelishments you can see in Final Impressions, below.</p>

<p>Angels are usually paragon-tier, and are more involved in the world (and more
likely to meet PCs) than deities or exarchs. They have quite a few signature
abilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flight (obviously!)</li>
  <li>Immunity to fear</li>
  <li>Resist 10 Radiant</li>
  <li>Angelic Presence: all attacks against the angel take a -2 penalty while it’s
not bloodied.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are the four angels we get in the Monster Manual, all of which reappear in
the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="angel-of-battle">Angel of Battle</h2>

<figure class="left">

<p>Angels of Battle are military leaders. They most commonly lead angels of valor
(below) into battle, but sometimes also lead mortal forces. When gods send
angels of battle to deal with a situation, they’re not interested in
dialogue. It looks like it’s made of flowing silver, with metallic wings.</p>

<p>The Angel of Battle is a Level 15 Skirmisher Leader. It has 148 HP, with a
slighly weaker Reflex and a slighter stronger Will than what is average for
their level. It’s pretty fast, with a ground speed of 8 and a flight speed
of 12.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is with a falchion. It’ll mostly use that through Mobile Melee
Attack, which allows it to move half its speed (so, up to 6 squares) and attack
at any point in the movement without provoking attacks of opportunity for moving
away. Hitting with an attack allows it to mark the target as a Chosen Foe, which
means it will grant combat advantage to <em>everyone</em> until the end of the angel’s
next turn. In an emergency, the angel can forcefully eject the metal feathers of
its wings in a Storm of Blades, which does high damage in a Close Burst 3 and
cuts its fly speed down to 2 until the end of the fight.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault version is almost identical, with the only difference aside
from the fixed damage being that the effect of Chosen Foe was rolled up into the
description of the falchion attack.</p>

<p>So here you have an opponent who keeps flying around just outside of melee reach
and swooping down to harass the PCs and mark priority targets for its buddies to
attack. It pairs well with enemies that exploit from Combat Advantage.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 15, an all-angel party with an Angel of Battle
leading two Angels of Protection and 8 Angel of Valor minions. I guess they
could be part of the guard contingent for an evil god’s temple, or maybe a hit
squad sent by an evil god against a level 12 or 13 party the god sees as an
obstacle to their plans.</p>

<h2 id="angel-of-protection">Angel of Protection</h2>

<figure class="left">

<p>These are basically Angelic Knights Templar, serving as bodyguards for important
faithful and protecting temples. It has fluffy feathered wings and wears golden
plate.</p>

<p>They’re level 14 Soldiers, with 141 HP. Their Reflex and Will are a couple of
points below average, and it’s a bit slower than the Angel of Battle with “speed
6, fly 8”. In addition to the standard Angelic Presence, it has the Angelic
Shield aura, which makes the 5 squares around it difficult terrain for enemies
if the angel’s ward is also inside the aura and Angelic Presence is active.</p>

<p>What’s this about the angel’s ward? Yeah, an Angel of Protection can designate
another creature as its ward as a standard action. Wards that remain within 5
squares of the angel get a +2 to AC and take only half damage from all attacks,
with the angel taking the other half. The angel itself fights with a greatsword
that does added radiant damage.</p>

<p>A given creature can only be the ward of one angel at a time, so encounter
groups with more than one of these angels should probably either contain
multiple “principals”, or you could set up a sort of “bodyguard chain”, with one
angel protecting the principal, the second one protecting the first, and so
on. They’d want spread out a bit in this case, to cover more of the battlefield
in difficult terrain.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault version is almost identical aside from the fixed math. The
damage from its attack is also entirely radiant now.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 14 and has two Angels of Protection, an Eidolon
and 3 dragonborn raiders. Clearly these people are serving Tiamat.</p>

<h2 id="angel-of-valor">Angel of Valor</h2>

<figure class="left">

<p>The rank and file of <del>Throne</del> the Astral Sea. Individually they’re the weakest
of all the angels, but there are “vast armies” of them. When a powerful cleric
needs numbers to get the job done, they summon a bunch of these. One might also
be sent to reward the follower of a god for meritorious deeds, either by
delivering a magic item or with 10 days of service. Angels of valor are made of
fire!</p>

<p>We get several stat blocks for them. The first one is for a Level 8
Soldier, who is likely to be the first angelic opposition the party finds in the
campaign. It has 88 HP, and Resist 10 Fire in addition to the usual radiant
resistance. They have a flight speed of 9.</p>

<p>It dual-wields a longsword and a dagger, and can attack with both on the same
turn. While bloodied, it can light its weapons on fire for a turn, during which
they deal fire damage instead of physical and target Reflex instead of AC. This
makes me think the angel is dipping its blades in its own blood, which is a lot
more Metal than I expected to see in this entry. It can also call lightning from
the heavens on its own position once per encounter, hitting everything on a
Close Burst 1 with mild lightning damage and dazing them for a turn (the angel
itself suffers no damage, of course).</p>

<p>The other stat blocks are Minions of varying levels: 11, 16 and 21, wielding
greatswords. Nothing too terribly exciting about them on their own, but it does
tell me that angels of valor have a role to play all through an angel-heavy
campaign. The Monster Vault has only 16 Minion Soldier version, which I think is
a bit of a loss.</p>

<p>There are two suggested encounters here. The first is level 8, with two regular
angels of valor in the company of a doppelganger assassin and a pair of
shadar-kai. Servants of the Raven Queen, perhaps?</p>

<p>The other is level 11, with 4 angel minions, two basilisks and a bunch of
snake cultists. Zehir worshippers, clearly.</p>

<p>Another interesting use for them with late Heroic tier groups would be to flip
the script and have a PC’s deity reward them with the temporary services of an
Angel of Valor.</p>

<h2 id="angel-of-vengeance">Angel of Vengeance</h2>

<figure class="left">

<p>Here’s an interesting factoid about paladins and clerics in Fourth Edition: they
no longer lose their powers if they abandon their deity’s service. The gods need
a different way to punish these prodigal sons, and that’s where Angels of
Vengeance come in. In addition to punishing those who have angered the gods they
serve, they’re sometimes sent to test those servants who are in danger of
falling (and to immediately punish them when they do).</p>

<p>Towering creatures of cold fire (they’re Large), Angels of Vengeance are Level
19 Elite Brutes. They have 446 HP and Resist 15 Fire, Cold and Radiant. With a
speed of “8, fly 12”, you will likely not be able to outrun them. It trades away
the usual Angelic Presence for a Cloak of Vengeance, which in addition to the
attack penalty causes 1d8 fire and 1d8 cold damage to anyone who attacks the
angel. Not a lot at these levels, but it’s automatic and can add up over time.</p>

<p>These angels wield paired longswords that do almost as much damage as they
should under the new math, which is remarkable. This damage is a mix of
physical, fire and cold. Being an elite, the angel can make two longsword
attacks per turn.</p>

<p>The most interesting power here is certainly Sign of Vengenace, a minor action
encounter power with a range of “sight”. Once the angel has placed the Sign on a
target, it can teleport right next to it as a move action until the end of the
encounter. So the first sign you’ve angered an Angel of Vengeance is when it
teleports into your back line from atop a mountain several kilometers away. A
mobile striker’s worst nightmare.</p>

<p>When the angel is bloodied, it turns into a pillar of cold fire for a turn. The
resulting explosion causes fire and cold damage in a Close Burst 2, and makes
the angel immune to damage while it lasts.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault version is pretty much identical aside from the fixed damage
notation. All of its attack damage is now “cold and fire”, and the Cloak of
vengeance causes a flat 10 cold and fire damage instead of 1d8 each. If you</p>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 19 and consistes of <em>two</em> of these bad boys
teleporting into your back line while a squad of Angels of Valor rushes forward
to engage. That’s how Vecna tells you how he <em>really</em> feels about your party.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Fourth Edition angels are very different from their Third Edition counterparts,
and sparked early skirmishes in the edition wars when they were released as
preview material. Them not being universally Good was a major break from
tradition, and the new “humanoid silhouette” look was not a hit.</p>

<p>While I’m a fan of the new cosmology myself, I confess 4e angels never sounded
very exciting to me until I began this Let’s Read. When I first read these
books, “Angels == Good” was still a firmly entrenched notion in my mind due to
the traditional Christian depiction of them, so I was hesitant to use them as
enemies.</p>

<p>My opinion has been completely turned around these days thanks to reading the
marvelous <a href="https://killsixbilliondemons.com/">Kill Six Billion Demons</a> webcomic. Its badass kung fu angels give
me an excellent frame of reference for the ones in the Monster manual,
particularly because they have all sorts of different moral outlooks while still
remaining badass kung fu angels. The Angel of Vengeance here is reminds me very
strongly of them, since it also has that “barely contained nuclear explosion
inside a physical shell” vibe.</p>

<p>So if you want 4e angels to feel less generic, K6BD can be an excellent source
of inspiration. Perhaps the servants of each deity organize themselves in
knightly orders, each following a different code. Membership in such an order
alters the angel’s physical shell in specific ways: maybe an angel of Pelor
looks like the luminous silhouettes here, but one serving Bane or Tiamat looks
more like a K6BD Thorn Knight. Then you have those unaligned mercenaries, and I
can easily imagine “Reach Heaven Through Violence” being one of <em>their</em> central
tenets.</p>

            <p>This article is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Here’s our first multi-entry, and it’s epic. Abominations as a category were
introduced in the Epic Level Handbook for 3.0, where they were described as the
abandoned creations of the gods. This is still true here, with the added bit
that some of them were created as living weapons for the battle between gods and
primordials.</p>

<p>Unlike the previous entry on Aboleths, this one is more of a grab-bag, with
several epic monsters that don’t have much in common with each other beyond “is
a horror from the dawn of time”. None of them are in the Monster Vault. Let’s
take then one by one.</p>

<h2 id="astral-stalker">Astral Stalker</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/mm4-astral-stalker.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The illustration is of a big muscular humanoid with jet-black scaly skin, a
skull-like face, and huge claws. It wears a loincloth made out of skulls, so you
know he’s Metal. I think they’re originally from some Forgotten Realms book, but
I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Here, Astral Stalkers were living weapons created by the gods to fight the
primordials. Given they’re Evil, covered in scales and have lots of
assassin-themed abilities, I’m placing the blame squarely on Zehir’s
shoulders. Abandoned after the war, enough of them survived to form a stable
population. They live in small communities in the Astral Sea.</p>

<p>Stalker culture centers on hunting. A village is led by the stalker who has the
most impressive hunting trophies, and they love testing themselves against
worthy foes. They like to hunt alone but will join up in pairs or larger groups
to go after particularly impressive quarries, and might sell their services to
other beings.</p>

<p>The Stalker is a Medium immortal humanoid, and a Level 22 Elite Lurker. It can
become invisible at will and has a Stealth of +24, meaning that even the
designated party radar probably has a less than even chance of detecting it
before it strikes. Its opening attack will likely be a bone dart ejected from
its throat, which does somewhat anemic damage but will progressively numb the
victim: Slowed, moving on to Immobilized and Stunned with failed saves. It will
follow this up with claw attacks (two on a slowed or immobilized target, one
otherwise) that might each get a sneak attack bonus, and that mark the target as
the stalker’s quarry. The Stalker can have one quarry at a time, and always
knows exactly where its quarry is even across planes. The only way to stop being
a stalker’s quarry is if the stalker kills you or chooses someone else to hunt.</p>

<p>Skill-wise, they’re trained in both Stealth and Perception (Perception doesn’t
appear in the skill list, but the +5 training bonus is at the top of their stat
block). This makes them good at tracking even before they mark someone as their
quarry.</p>

<p>The quarry-related abilities are interesting, and make the Astral Stalker one of
the only monsters with powers that span more than a single fight. I can picture
a Stalker or two ambushing the party, fighting for a few rounds, marking one or
two PCs as quarries and then running away. Then they comes back to harass them
all throught the adventure, forcing the PCs to figure out a way to stop them
from running.</p>

<p>A good twist on the default stalker story might be to have the party enter a
tense alliance with an Astral Stalker to hunt a villain down across the
planes. Once the deal is done, the creature might acknowledge the badassitude of
the PCs by choosing them as its next target…</p>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 22, and features a stalker that has joined up
with a party of epic-level devils. If your party has pissed Hell off in past
adventures, this fight would be a good “welcome to epic tier!” event.</p>

<p>As statted, the stalker’s attacks don’t seem to do all that much damage for an
epic creature, so it could use some updated math. However, those darts are
at-will and Stunned is Serious Business! A Stunned character can do <em>nothing</em>
except hope for a successful save. I think D&amp;D 4 players hate this even more
than death itself. As an Elite monster the Stalker is also in need of a way to
perform two attacks per turn, so my recommendation here would be to make the
darts a minor action.</p>

<h2 id="atropal">Atropal</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/mm-4e-atropal.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2008 Wizards of the Coast

</figure>

<p>Back when I first read the Epic Level Handbook, the description of the Atropal
was the first thing that made me go “whoa!”. Their origin here remains exactly
the same as it was back then: they’re stillborn gods, scorned by life but still
posessing enough power to raise as undead.</p>

<p>The MM uses “unfinished” instead of “stillborn”, and the illustration looks a
lot less like a baby than the one in the ELH, which I suppose is
understandable. It’s still quite horrific, though. Being Large marks it as the
corpse of something not human.</p>

<p>3.x Atropals were quite complex, with lots of spell-like abilities. Here they
are Level 28 Elite Brutes who are completely immune to necrotic and poison
damage, but Vulnerable 10 to radiant. So it’s not the wizard they must fear, but
the cleric. They have 638 HP, and their weak defense is Reflex.</p>

<p>Atropals project a wide-ranging aura that heals undead and damages living
creatures caught in it every turn. Getting hit with radiant damage cancels it,
but they can start it up again with a minor action. Their basic melee attack is
a touch that targets Reflex, with a rider that eliminates the target’s necrotic
resistance and gives them a -2 penalty to attacks. Its other attack is the
Atropos Burst, which does a bunch of necrotic damage to anyone inside the aura,
eats a healing surge, and gives the atropal 1 action point if it hits
anyone. Its use it limited, but it recharges every time someone is reduced to
0hp in the aura. For extra Fun(TM), have it fight the PCs in an area containing
innocent bystanders or cute woodland creatures that can double as burst fuel.</p>

<p>Oh, and these things move with a fly speed of 9, so they can happily go over
your defenders to hit the squishies from above. One can depopulate a city in no
time at all just by zooming around and spamming Atropos Burst to kill anything
their aura doesn’t.</p>

<p>You’ll rarely fight a lone atropal, of course. They attract other high-level
undead. The sample encounter has them being followed by a party of sorrowsworn,
which doesn’t really work because sorrowsworn aren’t undead and so will take
damage from its aura. I recommend adding one or two epic liches and assorted
minions instead.</p>

<h2 id="blood-fiend">Blood Fiend</h2>

<p>It appears that in previous editions blood fiends where what you got when you
turned a demon into a vampire. That origin appears to be mostly gone, as they’re
not undead here.</p>

<p>Blood Fiends are Medium elemental humanoids and thus native to the Elemental
Chaos, but contrary to their name are not demons either. You wouldn’t be able to
tell just from looking, though. They’re Chaotic Evil, feed on blood and love
hunting for food and sport. They hunt in packs and sometimes associate with
other powerful elemental creatures (but not with demons!).</p>

<p>It’s not spelled out, but I would guess that in Fourth Edition these guys were
created by the primordials to fight the gods, placing them in direct conflict
with the Astral Stalkers. I wonder if they keep hunting each other to this
day. It would also make sense to say that, as uncorrupted primordial creations,
they dislike demons.</p>

<p>Blood Fiends are Level 23 Soldiers and look like four-armed, hairless gorillas
with sharp teeth and claws. They attack with their claws and with an
immobilizing gaze attack. If they have combat advantage, they can instead attack
with a blood-draining bite that counts as a grab and causes ongoing damage and
heals the fiend until the target can escape.</p>

<p>I find them to be kinda bland, except for the fact that they have an Int
of 22. This is at odds with pretty much anything else in their stat block, and
gives you an opening to play them like sophisticated murder sages. Their only
trained skill is Intimidate, which doesn’t mean they can’t do anything else,
just that intimidation is their “thing”.</p>

<p>The suggested encounter has three of them working as hired muscle for a pair of
efreeti.</p>

<p>I also remember seeing these guys from the Epic Level Handbook, which said they
came from either the distant past of the distant future, and were so far from
their time of origin that they don’t know how to return any more. While there’s
no mention of this background here, it kinda makes sense as the reason why they
were included under Abominations - they’re horrors from the edge of time, but
<em>which</em> edge is something not even the phanes know.</p>

<p>Phanes are Large immortal magical beasts who live in the Astral Sea but prowl
the entire cosmos on the hunt for prey, “walking between moments”. They’re
described as liking to spread chaos for its own sake, but are Unaligned and have
Int 28, so I guess it should be possible to have peaceful interactions with
one. At least until it decides its best shot at returning home is to start a
chain of events that leads to a specific future and starts with the death of the
PCs.</p>

<p>They’re level 26 Elite Controllers who fight like skirmishers and are all about
manipulating time. Their claw attacks target Reflex and both slow the target and
allow the phane to shift 4 squares either before or after the attack, so they
can play keep-away. Their ranged attack is a Wizening Ray, which targets
fortitude and both slows and weakens, with the weakening effect lasting
longer. This is explained as artificially aging the target, who looks old and
decrepit until they manage to save against all the effects. Phanes also have a
Wizening Storm that’s a close burst 1 and seems to age the targets even more
(Stunned, with an aftereffect of Dazed and Weakened). They can also
automatically cancel a negative effect placed on them per round, through
timey-wimey shenanigans.</p>

<p>Phanes are insubstantial, so they take half damage from pretty much anything
even before they weaken the PCs. They run and fly very fast, too. Their
preferred tactics are playing keep-away and shooting Wizening Rays at the party,
so I guess the Wizening Storm is kept in reserve as a nasty surprise in case the
PCs manage to get close to them. Man, fighitng these guys must be <em>so annyoing</em>.</p>

<p>The proposed encounter joins a phane with a pair of sorrowsworn and two dread
wraiths, the <em>other</em> insubstantial monster that can weaken. I think that’s a tad
excessive.</p>

<p>While the provided stat block doesn’t give them any ability to move between
planes at will, that’s totally something they should be able to do outside of
combat. The same goes for Astral Stalkers, I think.</p>

<p>This beastie needs no introduction! Present since the days of AD&amp;D, it’s always
been presented as kind of the ultimate test of player badassitude, even though
it was kinda underwhelming in D&amp;D 3.x.</p>

<p>In 4e the Tarrasque was created by the primordials to destroy the works of the
gods, and it’s inexorably bound to the world. I picture its creation being
something much like a planetary-scale version of Exalted’s Great Curse, uttered
by the defeated Primordials just before they were imprisoned.</p>

<p>The Tarrasque sleeps at the planet’s core and wakes up every once in a while to
feed and wreck shit. It’s a Gargantuan Elemental Magical Beast, and a Level 30
Solo Brute, suitable for either the final battle in a campaign or the one just
before it (with the final battle being against a primordial or equivalent).</p>

<p>Defensively, it’s immune to charm and fear and has resist 10 to all damage,
which is quite rare. It also has an Earthbinding Aura that extends out to
maximum longbow range in all directions, and limits flight to an altitude that
places it within the beast’s reach. It’s speed is 8 (so, pretty fast), and it
also has similar climb and burrow speeds. Yes, it can swim in the ground like it
was water to take cover from an all-ranged party and come up from underneath
them.</p>

<p>Offensively, its attacks ignore all resistances. Its basic attack is a bite that
also causes 15 ongoing damage. While unbloodied, it can use Fury of the
Tarrasque, which allows it to make a bite attack and either rend for triple bite
damage plus a 1-turn -5 penalty to AC, or to perform a tail slap that throws
targets far away and knocks them prone. If bloodied, this is replaced by a
frenzy that gives it a bite attack against anyone in a close burst 3. Finally,
it can use a standard action to move its speed and trample anyone in its way. As
a Solo, it has two action points.</p>

<p>Reducing the Tarrasque to 0 HP (from its initial total of 1412) will simply make
it quit the fight and burrow back to the center of the planet to sleep it
off. Killing the beast for good involves somehow removing it from the world
before fighting it.</p>

<p>This Tarrasque seems to have covered the weakness of its 3.x predecessor pretty
well, but it suffers quite a bit from the early Monster Manual math bugs. The
damage from its attacks is less than half of what it should be, so be sure to
apply the math fixes before throwing it at your party.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>My feelings towards this entry are as much of a mixed bag as the entries
themselves. Since I’m not aware of the Astral Stalker’s past incarnations, I
have no particular emotional attachment to it, but it seems reasonably cool.</p>

<p>I know of the Atropal and the Phane from the Epic Level Handbook, and from that
I see these incarnations of them keep the general flavor of the originals while
being effective threats. They could have used a little more lore elaboration,
which I guess is true of most monsters in the MM.</p>

<p>The Phane might be a bit <em>too</em> effective, though. Insubstantial plus at-will
Weakening attacks is a recipe for a long and drawn-out fight, since it
essentially quarters the party’s damage output. Having it team up with wraiths
compounds the problem since, as we’ll eventually see, they follow the same
formula.</p>

<p>The Blood Fiend failed to wow me. Even with its unexpectedly high Int score it’s
still kinda bland, and so easy to confuse with a demon I might as well use a
demon instead of it. The “demonic vampire” angle is a little better, so if I had
to them I’d probably bring that back.</p>

<p>I’ve always found the Tarrasque cool, and the new “ḱaiju sleeping in the center
of the world” bit is awesome. It stats really showcase the problem with too-low
monster damage of these early 4e monster books, though, so it becomes a lot less
threatening than it’s supposed to be unless you fix it.</p>
