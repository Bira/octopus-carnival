<p>It’s true! I mean, it’s common for fantasy settings to have items made of one or
more fantastic materials in them, but Tamriel (the setting of Skyrim and other
Elder Scrolls games) goes the extra mile by naming its selection after
completely different real-world materials. So you get things like high-end armor
made from “refined malachite”, which in our world is also known as “copper”.</p>

<p>GURPS takes a more realistic approach, so when adapting this stuff to GURPS you
need to modify it a little. Here are some Tamrielic cultures written in a format
similar to the one shown in <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Treasures 1: Glittering
Prizes</strong>, and slightly modified to fit better with GURPS DF. Page references
are given for published game effects, and full stats are given to new ones.</p>

<p>I’m mostly basing myself on Skyrim here, since that’s what I played the
most. Any differences between the material below and official lore can be either
born of my ignorance of the overall setting or a change I made on purpose to fit
what I find interesting.</p>

<h2 id="the-nords-of-skyrim">The Nords of Skyrim</h2>

<p>These are pretty much your standard off-brand Vikings. Nords were some of the
first humans to arrive on the continent of Tamriel, sailing into frosty Skyrim
from even frostier Altmora thousands of years ago. They typically value martial
prowess and distrust magic, though there are also plenty of peaceful or
mystically-inclined Nords.</p>

<p>Present-day Nord artisans usually disdain fancy or “impossible” materials,
placing greater value on the skill that goes into making an object. Clothing is
sturdy, warm, and predominantly made of wool and cotton. Fancier attire tends to
be quilted, vividly dyed and/or trimmed with fur. Jewelry consists of rings,
chains or amulets made from precious metals and often jeweled. Cold-weather gear
made mostly from furs is also a common sight.</p>

<p>Weapons and armor are mostly made from plain old steel. Nords like one-handed
swords and axes, usually wielded with round medium shields. Spears (1- or
2-handed) are also popular, with regular and long bows being the premier ranged
weapons. Armor tends to be mail, scale or plate, and is often fur-lined for
extra protection against the cold. This gear is commonly decorated with carved
reliefs of spiral patterns, or with motifs depicting wolves, bears and
eagles. Nords love horned helmets, though they prefer the look of curled ram
horns rather than the straight ones usually depicted in more cliche Viking
imagery.</p>

<p><em>Ancient</em> Nords were similar, though they were bigger fans of magic. Many
ancient weapons that survive to this day are enchanted or feature “impossible”
embellishments like solid quicksilver inlays. Some ancient Nord smiths even made
weapons and armor entirely from that material. Ancient Nord decoration often
features a dragon motif in addition to the others present in modern day items.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics">Game Statistics</h3>

<p><strong>Fur-Lined</strong>: Fur-lined armor acts as winter clothing, removing HT penalties to
resist FP loss from cold. Even if the GM isn’t using detailed rules for that,
they can still declare that such protection is required to enter particularly
inhospitable places (like the Ice Caverns of the Frost Wyrm). +1 CF.</p>

<p>Most Nord gear has no inherent CF or reaction modifier, particularly in a
campaign set in Skyrim or whatever your world’s own Nord-land is. Fine-quality
and Ornate +1 gear is relatively common, though.</p>

<h2 id="high-elves">High Elves</h2>

<p>The High Elves of Tamriel, also known as the Altmer, enthusiastically live up to
every “snobby elf” stereotype. As a culture, they see themselves as direct
descendants of the gods, trapped in mortal flesh when the world was
created. This often manifests of a disdain for the other, more “worldly”
peoples, and as a distressing tendency to form ruthless elven supremacist
organizations.</p>

<p>Unlike the Nords, High Elves go all in on using fancy or impossible materials
for everyday items. Clothing tends towards regal robes of elaborately woven and
dyed silk with gold thread embroidery, featuring wing, bird, and solar
motifs. Gold jewelry is prized, particularly rings, earrings and hair
ornaments. “Fake it till you make it” is the order of the day among high elves
that can’t afford the genuine article.</p>

<p>Elven armorers eschew ferrous metals in favor of bronze, and will prefer to use
more “magical” substances like refined moonstone or tempered glass if they can
get their hands on them. Their preferred weaponry runs to fencing weapons and
fancy polearms, as well as composite bows. For armor they like shiny mail and
light plate suits. Wings and solar disks or rays are also common decorative
motifs for elven armor and weapons, either carved in relief or inlaid in gold or
solid quicksilver. Gilding is also quite popular.</p>

<p>Note that the leven of ornamentation of a piece of elven gear doesn’t have
anything to do with its quality - it’s quite common for very ornate pieces to be
of otherwise standard quality.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics-1">Game Statistics</h3>

<p>Altmer bows and mail armor always carry the <strong>Elven</strong> modifier. Elven “mail”
here is actually light plate armor. It has the same DR and weight, and can have
modifiers that apply to plate armor.</p>

<p><strong>Bronze</strong>: In Dungeon Fantasy bronze weapons and armor have exactly the same
stats and price as their steel equivalents. They’re just, well,
bronze-colored.</p>

<p><strong>Refined Moonstone</strong>: Magically reinforced aluminum! This is an “implausible
material” like those found on DF 8 or DF Treasures 1. It’s conductive but not
flammable. Items made of refined moonstone have a silvery, pearlescent color. +4
CF.</p>

<p><strong>Tempered Glass</strong>: This is described in DF 8 for weapons. Plate or scale armor
can also be made of tempered glass. Such armor has +6 CF, is neither flammable
nor conductive, and makes you look like you’re wearing a Tiffany lamp.</p>

<p>High Elven gear has no inherent CF modifier, though it’s usually expensive
because of all the ornamentation it carries. In places and times where those
elven supremacist organizations are around, wearing Altmer gear gets you a -2
reaction penalty from pretty much everyone. Unless you happen to be a High Elf
yourself, in which case other High Elves (only) will not react at a penalty.</p>

<h2 id="dark-elves">Dark Elves</h2>

<p>The Dark Elves of Tamriel, also known as Dunmer, hail from the distant
ash-choked plains of Morrowind, a place with little metal but plenty of
monstrous giant bugs. As such, many of their durable goods tend to be made out
of chitin and bone rather than metal or stone.</p>

<p>Dunmer clothing is made out of tough fabric, dyed in drab or dark tones. Fancier
outfits are more colorful and have arabesque patterns made using embroidery or
block printing, and might include elaborate hats. Weapons and armor are made out
of expertly molded chitin or bone more often than they’re made of metal, and
it’s pretty much inevitable that they’ll be “decorated” do look like bugs or
skeletons due to that.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics-2">Game Statistics</h3>

<p><strong>Chitin</strong>: Chitin armor tends to be smooth and slightly shiny, and is usually
brown or black in color. There’s a bewildering variety of giant bugs in
Morrowind, so any leather, scale or plate armor can be made from chitin. +1 CF.</p>

<p><strong>Bone</strong>: Described in DF 8 and DF Treasures 1.</p>

<p>Items of Dunmer make have no inherent CF modifiers. People unfamiliar with
chitin and bone armor might react to the wearer at -1 or worse.</p>

<h2 id="the-dwarves">The Dwarves</h2>

<p>There are no Dwarves in Tamriel. For some reason the whole civilization just up
and vanished centuries ago, leaving behind a whole lot of ruins filled with
automaton guardians and other still-functioning machinery.</p>

<p>There isn’t any dwarf clothing left to describe - as far as the surviving
accounts go, no one saw them wear anything but heavy armor. Dwarven weapons and
armor, as well as most of their durable goods, are made of an advanced metal
alloy no one else knows how to produce. It can be molded in a standard forge
just fine, though. This makes raiding dwarven ruins for their metal fittings a
profitable, if risky, endeavor. All of these items are often decorated with
engraved geometric patterns made out of straight lines. Ancient dwarven helmets
look like sculpted faces - in fact, people in full dwarven plate don’t look much
different than one of their constructs.</p>

<p>Dwarves seem to have favored one-handed maces and axes, used with heavy metal
shields. For ranged combat, they used crossbows of varying complexity.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics-3">Game Statistics</h3>

<p>Dwarven weapons and armor always have the <strong>Dwarven</strong> modifier where
applicable. Genuine Dwarven antiques can be sold at an extra +3 CF to
collectors.</p>

<h2 id="the-orcs">The Orcs</h2>

<p>Elder Scrolls Orcs are not considered monsters, and have been a part of
civilized society for a long time. Still, they love fighting even more than
Nords do, and a significant percentage of them are devout worshippers of the God
of Having a Chip on Your Shoulder.</p>

<p>Traditional orc clothing is made from light and breathable fabrics, dyed in
bright colors and some times adorned with quilting or embroidery. Brimless
cylindrical hats are commonly worn by men. “Hardcore” orcs go live in isolated
enclaves where they embrace the “Barbarian Hero” aesthetic of crude hide and
canvas tunics and loincloths. Both types of orc take immense pride in their
ability to craft weapons and armor, though.</p>

<p>Orcs favor nasty serrated blades as weapons, and elaborate suits of plate for
armor - preferrably spiked. The more ornate versions have extensive and
elaborate arabesque reliefs. Orc armorers never use exotic materials solely for
decoration, but they have great love for meteoric iron and orichalcum due to
their useful properties. Orcs take their smithing quite seriously, and orc-made
gear has a higher than usual chance of being Fine-quality or better.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics-4">Game Statistics</h3>

<p>Orc gear has no inherent CF modifier or reaction bonus.</p>

<p>Serrated weapons are presented in DF Treasures 1, and spiked armor is in DF 1 or
Adventurers.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Monstrous beetles are some of the most traditional opposition for low-level
adventurers, so it’s no surprise they show up here. I was sure they’d have an
entry in the Monster Vault, but it turns out they’re MM-only. We get three
monstrous beetles in this entry, all of them Unaligned and possessed of Int 1,
the minimum possible value.</p>

<p><strong>Fire Beetles</strong> are the most traditional beetles of all. In my experience their
name often made people think they had some sort of fire attack in previous
editions, but it actually referred to the fact that they glow. Well, here they
finally get their fire attack!</p>

<p>4e Fire Beetles are Small Natural Beasts and Level 1 Brutes with 32 HP. They
bite and can use a Fire Spray (recharge 5-6) that does fire damage in a Close
Blast 3. Defensively, they have Resist 10 Fire. And yes, you can still extract
the glowing glands from a dead fire beetle and use them as torches.</p>

<p><strong>Tangler Beetles</strong> are one of the many beasts often tamed by humanoids and used
as guard animals. They’re Large Natural Beasts and Level 5 Controllers with 62
HP. They have a bite basic attack, and a ranged Entangling Spittle attack that
does no damage but immobilizes the target.</p>

<p><strong>Rot Scarab Swarms</strong> are the first swarm monster we’ve run into in this book,
and are a good showcase of the swarm rules. Individually, they’re
normal-beetle-sized and native to areas tainted by the Shadowfell (making them
shadow beasts).</p>

<p>The scarab swarm counts as a single Medium creature, a Level 8 Soldier. It has a
Swarm Attack aura 1 that allows it to make free basic attacks against anyone who
begins their turn caught in it. That basic attack is a necrotic “Swarm of Bites”
that also does ongoing necrotic damage, and they get to attack normally in their
action as well. They take half damage from melee and ranged attacks, and 10
extra damage from close (burst/blast) and area attacks.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 1, a trio of kobolds and their two pet fire
beetles.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like that Fire Beetles finally get a fire attack. I seem to remember them
having one in Neverwinter Nights, but I’m not sure if they had one in actual 3.x
D&amp;D. I’m fairly sure they didn’t have it earlier than that.</p>

<p>Rot Scarabs are a nicely creepy addition to a crypt-themed dungeon. They’re
undead-adjacent but not undead themselves, so I guess encountering them can be
somewhat surprising for PCs. Including them in a fight against undead is a good
way to make sure the cleric can’t shut the whole opposing force down with a
single turning attempt.</p>

<p>We have bears in the real world, so they don’t require much in the way of
introduction. D&amp;D has always included a variety of bears in its bestiaries,
their various real-world species lending themselves well to the “pallette swap”
approach preferred by its older editions.</p>

<p>After going through a few Monster Manual-only entries, we finally arrive at one
that exists in both books. The Monster Vault has an appendix with stats for
mundane animals, likely a response to complaints from traditionalist players
that the original Monster Manuals didn’t include any.</p>

<p>But wait! If the Monster Manual doesn’t have anything on mundane animals, what
does it say about bears? Let’s find out.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>They’re bears. Large, omnivorous, inhabit temperate or colder areas. I wasn’t
aware of it until recently, but it appears the “Bear Lore” entry in the Monster
Manual is kind of a running joke among 4e players. It’s structured just like the
lore entries for weirder monsters, so it ends up telling us a PC needs to
succeed at a DC 20 Nature check to know that bears attack with their
claws.</p>

<p>IIRC, while real-life bears can be dangerous, they usually don’t go out of their
way to attack humans, so most bear encounters will be peaceful. Of course, this
being D&amp;D, you can encounter some bears that don’t exist in real life and that
are far more ornery.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Combining the two books gives us three different bears: a mundane Bear (MV), a
Cave Bear (MM), and the ever spiky Dire Bear (both). All are Unaligned natural
beasts and have Int 2.</p>

<p>The <strong>Bear</strong> likely represents a brown bear. It’s Large, and a Level 5 Brute
with 80 HP. It attacks with its claws, and can use a Bear Grab about twice per
fight (it recharges when the bear is bloodied). This allows it to make two claw
attacks against the same target, and if either one hits the target drops prone
and the bear grabs it <em>if it has fewer than two creatures grabbed</em>. This ain’t
no normal bear hug. At the start of the bear’s turn, it deals automatic damage
against any creatures it has grabbed.</p>

<p>The <strong>Cave Bear</strong> is meant to represent a species that’s extinct in our
world. It’s a Level 6 Elite Brute with 170 HP, but for some reason it’s only
Medium. It’s more of a striker than a grappler: aside from its claws, it has a
Cave Bear Frenzy that does claw damage in a Close Burst 1 and recharges on a
5-6. That’s a bit less multi-strike ability than I’d expect from an elite
monster, but not too much less.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dire Bear</strong> follows the “bigger and spikier” theme set for dire animals in
Third Edition. The Monster Vault version is merely an update of the Monster
Manual, so I recommend using that one in all cases. It’s a Large Natural Beast
and a Level 11 Elite Brute. Its basic attack are its claws, but it will rarely
use that. The Dire Bear’s real go-to ability is Maul, which is at-will and
allows it to make two claw attacks. If both hit the same target, the bear grabs
the target if it has fewer than two creatures grabbed. This grab requires a
secondary attack in the MM version, but not in the MV one. The bear can also use
a standard action to deal lots of automatic damage to a grabbed creature (that’s
where you use its action point).</p>

<p>Suggested encounters in the MM are: Level 6, two cave bears and one bugbear
strangler (“us bears gotta stick together!”); and level 11, 1 dire bear, 1 ettin
spirit-talker, and 3 ogre minions.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions.</h2>

<p>Well, they’re bears. While there’s nothing terribly exciting about them
lore-wise, they do their job mechanically (particularly the Monster Vault
variants).</p>

<p>One thing that might be fun is to have an evil druid as a villain, using charmed
bears to do his bidding. Have the party be on the receiving end of the
Aggressively Hegemonizing Ursine Swarm for once.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/04/10/fighter-shoots-itself.html">I Learned Something About Fighter Planes</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I’ve been playing a lot of Ace Combat 5 and 7 lately, so I have fighter jets in
the brain. And today I learned something I’d never have thought was possible
from looking at the way those games or RPGs like GURPS model them.</p>

<p>Apparently, modern fighter planes are so fast they can shoot <em>themselves</em> down
by outrunning their own cannon fire! Implausible, you say? Well, if you read
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/04/dutch-f-16-takes-cannon-fire-from-itself/#p3">this bit of news</a> you’ll see that it actually happened in January of this
year with an F-16, and that there are records of at least one other incident
from back in 1956 with a Grumman F-11.</p>

<p>The gist of it is that shells are fired from the aircraft’s cannon at a speed
equal to that of the aircraft plus their muzzle velocity, as you’d
expect. However, they’re quickly slowed down by drag, so it’s possible for a
plane flying at high speeds to accelerate past the bullets it just fired and
maneuver itself into a position to be hit by them.</p>

<p>GURPS and most RPGs just tend to treat projectiles as having infinite speed. A
character shoots, and the bullet flies out to its maximum range before the end
of that character’s turn. This is a pretty decent approximation for the type of
combat that usually happens in these games, which is between people on foot and
at relatively short ranges. <strong>GURPS Tactical Shooting</strong> does have some
additional rules for projectile flight time, but those are optional and mostly
meant for snipers<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. None of the existing rule sets contemplates the speed and
ranges involved in jet age air combat.</p>

<p>Do we need specific rules for this hazard? I would say not. It’s even more of a
niche situation than long-range sniping, and the bookkeeping required to track
it would not be all that fun even in a realistic game about air combat. No, what
we have here is an <em>excellent</em> result to use if someone rolls a critical failure
on a Gunnery or Pilot test. Even if you go on to become the Ace of Aces, your
squadron-mates will forever embarass you with stories of that one time you shot
yourself down.</p>

<p>Today’s monster is the Battlebriar, a plant creature that’s entirely new to
me. It exists only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Battlebriars are weaponized biotech! These plant monsters were created to serve
as living siege engines. A direct quote from the book: “They can destroy massed
formations of lesser troops, storm defended embankments, or bring down
fortifications.”</p>

<p>Being plants, these living engines of destruction are surprisingly
low-maintenance. As long as a battlebriar has access to water, fertile soil and
sunlight, it can live forever. This makes them good guardians in addition to
being siege weapons. Fey creatures like to use them to guard their
strongholds. Other battlebriar users include Hill Giants, which I found quite
interesting. Sometimes they also escape their masters and go live in the wild.</p>

<p>Battlebriars are Unaligned and have Int 3, so PCs are most likely to fight them
when going against their masters. A wild battlebriar will likely leave the PCs
alone if they don’t provoke it, though of course they might have no alternative
if it’s blocking their goal.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We’re given two stat blocks for these things.</p>

<p>The <strong>Warthorn Battlebriar</strong> is a Large natural animate (plant), and a Level 14
Controller with 141 HP and a ground speed of 6. It has an aura of Grasping
Thorns, with a 2-square radius, that makes its area difficult terrain for
enemies and deals 5 damage to any that start their turns there. This thing has
dozens of branches constantly flailing around!</p>

<p>Aside from a reach 2 claw as a basic attack, it can also fire thorns from those
branches in a close burst 2. This targets Reflex, dealing damage an slowing
targets for a turn. Furthermore, its claw attacks pull victims towards the
monster. Getting away from this thing is quite hard: you’re slowed, in difficult
terrain, and when you manage to get away it pulls you back. It also has
threatening Reach, and so can make opportunity out to its full reach of 2
squares.</p>

<p>Its big brother is the <strong>Earthrager Battlebriar</strong>, a Huge elemental animate
(plant). It’s a Level 28 Elite Brute with 634 HP, a ground speed of 8 and a
<em>burrow</em> speed of 6. It’s made out of vines rather than thorny brambles, so its
3-square aura pulls enemies towards it. It’s the Reach 3 claws that do the
slowing. It also has threatening reach, and it can trample - that last bit is
how it attacks several characters at once.</p>

<p>It resembles the Tarrasque in its tactics when on the offensive. When used as a
guardian, it burrows and uses tremorsense to detect intruders, erupting below
them to fight.</p>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 14, a Warthorn being used as a weapon by a
party of 2 cyclopes and 3 hill giants.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Living siege engines are always cool, and these are nicely thematic for fey or
elemental Earth-themed opposition. I liked them. Like every other MM monster,
they need the damage fix, but other than that I see no fault with them. I like
that their abilities match their in-world roles. The warthorn is your infantry
killer, and the Earthrager with its burrowing and trampling ability makes short
work of castles and walls.</p>

<p>The Earthrager is the sort of weapon a mortal or fey army would round up to
fight the Tarrasque… or, since it’s elemental, it might itself be a prototype
or herald for the Big T.</p>
