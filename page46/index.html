<p>This is the third and final post covering the huge Demogorgon entry in the
Monster Manual 2. As you might have guessed from what was said back in <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/06/11/demogorgon.html">part
1</a>, it covers not one but <em>two</em> multiversal big shots: the titular Demogorgon
and his buddy Dagon.</p>

<h2 id="demogorgon">Demogorgon</h2>

<p>Demogorgon has existed in D&amp;D since at least the days of AD&amp;D 1st Edition. As I
might have mentioned his <em>name</em> got really popular due to the Stranger Things TV
show, though I understand the monster there is a different creature from the
two-headed mandrill found in the actual game.</p>

<h3 id="the-lore">The Lore</h3>

<p>Demogorgon claims the title of Prince of Demons, which is quite the bold claim
even among demon lords. His personality and motivations make him the demon
lord’s demon lord. He’s not obsessed with a specific aspect of evil, like Orcus
is with undeath. He’s not overly committed to a single modus operandi like
Graz’zt is with his sexy manipulations. He doesn’t limit his influence to a
single people like Yeenoghu does with gnolls or Baphomet with minotaurs.</p>

<p>No, Demogorgon’s goals are to become the most powerful thing in the multiverse
and destroy anyone who causes him anger or jealousy (i.e, almost everyone). His
wordly cults, as we saw, are focused on wanton destruction and have this theme
of outward madness that hides powerful mysteries. He and his agents are also
quite capable of deception and will use that to achieve their goals just as
readily. You can find servants of Demogorgon anywhere in the universe, and they
can belong to any people. His domain in the Abyss is covered in tropical jungle
but also includes seas and vast brine flats, and he is at home in all of these
environments.</p>

<p>Demogorgon’s main enemies are Orcus and Graz’zt, but though these other two are
very powerful, Demogorgon is more. The books emphasize that he has never lost a
fight - that duel with the god Amoth that nearly split him in two? He won that
one, killed Amoth, killed Storralk right after it, and then got better. Though
to Amoth’s credit, he was the only entity to ever <em>scar</em> the demon lord: he used
to only have one head before the duel, and that remained split afterwards,
healing into the current two heads.</p>

<p>Each of Demogorgon’s heads has its own name, mind and personality: Aameul is the
one that prefers deception, and Hethradiah is the one that prefers
destruction. They detest each other and their plans are frequently at odds,
which is probably the main obstacle preventing the demon lord from conquering
the universe. Still, sometimes those competing plans end up synergizing into
something that advances his goals.</p>

<p>This split nature is reflected all the way down his cult hierarchies. The layout
of his temples is split down the middle with each half dedicated to one of the
heads. The most powerful cults are led by pairs of twins, each dedicated to a
head. And as we already say even individual cultists have a “dual nature” thing
going on, starting fights as cold and calculating combatants and devolving into
frothing berserkers when they’re wounded.</p>

<p>The most powerful among his cultists might know the ritual to summon an Aspect
of Demogorgon, a living echo of his power. Like the Aspects of Orcus, they share
the personality and a fraction of the power of their originator, but their
existence is independent. An aspect doesn’t know what the original is thinking,
and vice-versa. They’re a bit like avatars from previous editions.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Demogorgon himself is a Garguantuan Elemental Humanoid and a Level 34 Solo
Controller with the Aquatic and Demon keywords. This is literally
the highest-level monster we saw so far in the entire Let’s Read - Orcus, the
former holder of the title, was level 33. His HP total is 1260.</p>

<p>He has trained Perception and Darkvision, Variable Resistance 30 switchable
3x/encounter, ground and swim speeds of 8, and a teleport speed of 10. Remember,
a teleport speed means he can teleport at will.</p>

<p>He also has the two traits previously seen on ettins. <strong>Double Actions</strong> means
he rolls initiative twice at the start of combat, once for each head, and takes
two full turns each round. His immediate actions refresh before each action. You
have to specify which turn belongs to which head, though - that head can’t use
the other’s special power. <strong>Dual Brain</strong> allows him to automatically save
against the Dazed and Stunned conditions and against any charm effects at the
end of one of his turns.</p>

<p>In combat, Demogorgon fights with his copious tentacles and with psychic powers:
the basic attack is a <strong>Tentacle Strike</strong> (Reach 5 vs. AC), but he has many more
interesting options.</p>

<p><strong>Tentacle Blast</strong> (Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude) does almost the same damage and
deals ongoing 15 damage (save ends). If it hits a target that was already taking
ongoing damage, that damage is increased by 5. <strong>Forked Tail</strong> (Ranged 5
vs. Reflex) deals necrotic damage and weakens (save ends).</p>

<p>Those are the physical attacks; now for the magic ones!</p>

<p>Any enemy who starts their turn within 10 squares of Demogorgon is subject to
the <strong>Gaze of Abyssal Might</strong> (vs. Will; free action), which dazes until the end
of the target’s turn. He can let his enemies take a peek inside his minds with
<strong>Dual Aspects of Demogorgon</strong> (close blast 10 vs. Will; recharge 6) which deals
heavy psychic damage and knocks the targets unconscious (save ends) on a
hit. That’s a potential TPK right there.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, each head has a special power that can be used in its
assigned turn. These are minor actions, so they’ll happen alongside one of the
other attacks. They’re both Close Blast 5 vs. Will. <strong>Aameul’s Gaze</strong> does
psychic damage and dazes (save ends). If the target was already dazed, for
example by the Gaze of Abyssal Might, they are dominated instead (save
ends). <strong>Hethradiah’s Gaze</strong> does a bit less psychic damage but forces the
target to use an <em>at-will attack power</em> against a target of Demogorgon’s choice.</p>

<p>Running away from all this is also quite hard: <strong>Inescapable Grasp</strong> is a Ranged
<em>50</em> power that targets Will and teleports the target to a square within
tentacle reach of Demogorgon.</p>

<p>We also get a stat block for the Aspect of Demogorgon, which is very similar but
smaller in all ways. It’s “only” Huge, and a Level 25 Elite Controller with 476
HP. It uses Forked Tail as its basic attack and replaces the named gazes with a
<strong>Dominating Glare</strong> that deals psychic damage and dominates. It has all the
other attacks, including the Double Actions and Dual Brain traits.</p>

<h2 id="dagon">Dagon</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-demogorgon-dagon.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Dagon is inspired by the Lovecraftian entity of the same name, but is not quite
the same creature. He’s been in the game since the days of AD&amp;D.</p>

<h3 id="the-lore-1">The Lore</h3>

<p>The first primordials who entered the Abyss shortly after it had formed found
Dagon already lurking in its depths. He is the first and most ancient Demon
Lord. His presence poses a disturbing question: did Tharizdun create the Abyss,
or merely open a passage to it?</p>

<p>(I think this gets answered in the Demonomicon, but it’s still cool even if left
as a mystery).</p>

<p>Dagon is remarkably secretive for a demon lord, and he sits on an endless trove
of blasphemous knowledge and terrible cosmic secrets. He allied himself with
Demogorgon shortly after the latter became a demon lord, and the two have
cooperated ever since. Their cults often work together, and though Dagon’s
cultists are a minority in these joint efforts, access to their master’s
knowledge makes them very effective leaders.</p>

<p>Dagon shares some of his knowledge with Demogorgon to further both of their
goals, but ever since the the “split” he has taken to whispering different bits
of lore to each head, which ends up making Aameul and Hethradiah antagonize each
other even more.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Dagon is a Gargantuan Elemental Magical Beast with the Aquatic and Demon
keywords, and a Level 32 Solo Soldier with 1184 HP. He has the usual Darkvision
and Variable Resistance (10, 3x/encounter). His ground speed is only 4, which
doesn’t matter because you’re definitely fighting him underwater. He also has
swim and teleport speeds of 8. Dagon also has an <strong>Eye of the Abyss</strong> aura (10)
that pulls any enemies who start their turns inside 5 squares.</p>

<p>Dagon might begin the fight at range, using his control over <strong>Abyssal Tides</strong>
to attack the PCs. This is an Area Burst 3 within 20 vs. Reflex, doing force
damage and immobilizing the targets on a hit (save ends). As an effect, Dagon
can also teleport 5 squares.</p>

<p>Once the PCs are in reach, it’s Tentacle Town. Dagon can uses his tentacles
either for a basic <strong>Tentacle Strike</strong> (Reach 5 vs. AC) or a <strong>Tentacle Blast</strong>
(Close Blast 5 vs. AC), both of which damage and slide the targets 2 squares on
a hit. They also act on their own with <strong>Grasping Tentacles</strong> (Reach 5 vs. AC),
an interrupt that triggers when an enemy in reach attacks Dagon. This does a
little less damage than the basic attack and grabs the target. The escape DC is
something like 44 or 46 depending on the skill you use, which will be tricky for
a non-specialist even if they’re level 30. And of course these Reach 5 tentacles
have <strong>Threatening Reach</strong> as well.</p>

<p>It’s not all tentacles either! Dagon’s repertoire includes a hefty dose of pure
madness. <strong>Doom Drone</strong> (close burst 10 vs. Will; minor action; recharge 5-6)
targets enemies and does psychic damage. It also pulls them 5 squares and stuns
them on a hit (save ends). <strong>Form of Madness</strong> is similar but slides and dazes
instead of pulling and stunning. If several enemies manage to get in close
Dagon can use <strong>Claws of the Abyss</strong> (close burst 1 vs. Reflex) to deal heavy
physical damage with his non-tentacle appendages. Note he can use the claws
<em>and</em> both mental attacks in a turn.</p>

<p>The tactics paragraph makes a reference to a power named <strong>Wrath of the Deep</strong>,
though that’s not in the stat block. One of them is wrong. In either case
Dagon’s goal should be to keep all the PCs, particularly the squishies, well
inside the tentacled killing zone surrounding him.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Of the big bosses, only Demogorgon features in a sample encounter here: Level
35, him and two balors.</p>

<p>These two make nice final bosses for an epic campaign, though probably not at
the same time. Demogorgon’s Dual Brain gives him a decent amount of control
resistance. Dagon is a bit less strong in that area, but both of them can output
an incredible amount of control themselves.</p>

<p>I imagine that a campaign that ends with the defeat of Demogorgon is one where
Dagon never shows up in person at all - he’d be too clever to stick around in
that case. The reverse is harder to predict. Demogorgon values the alliance but
is probably too selfish to try and help Dagon if a party of epic demigods knocks
at his briny door. He might however, try to exact revenge on them later, so he
could end up being the “final final” boss in a Dagon-focused campaign. Or
perhaps he does things on a long enough timescale that he ends up being the boss
of the <em>next</em> campaign.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Continuing from the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/06/11/demogorgon.html">previous post</a>, this time we’ll be looking at Demogorgon’s
Exarchs.</p>

<p>“Exarch” is the term D&amp;D 4 uses for the “lieutenants” of a god or equivalent
entity. They might preside over a narrower slice of their master’s portfolio, or
simply help run their operations in the world and other planes. Though
subordinate to someone else, exarchs are in no way weak: in the god-ranking
system used in previous editions, all of them would have ranked as anything from
demigods to intermediate deities themselves.</p>

<p>Orcus, which we looked at in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/26/ettin.html">Monster Manual let’s Read</a>, had one exarch:
Dorensain, the King of Ghouls. Demogorgon has two, described below.</p>

<h2 id="kazuul">Kazuul</h2>

<p>Kazuul used to be a human champion of Erathis a long time ago, and in her
service he carved many a swath of order through savage lands. I guess that in
the end something convinced him that this “carving a swath” business didn’t make
him any different from the “savages” he claimed to oppose, and so he decided to
embrace that and pledge himself to Demogorgon.</p>

<p>The demon lord gave him a gift of size and strength, making him double in size
and become deformed by his over-developed demonic musculature. Kazuul now fights
in the name of Hethradiah, the “brutal but cunning” head, driving a horde of
demons before him to raid places in the Abyss and elsewhere in the multiverse. I
guess Kazuul is a big inspiration to those shrieking cultists we saw in the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/06/11/demogorgon.html">last post</a>.</p>

<p>Being a former human, Kazuul fights with weapons. Being a former <em>adventurer</em>,
he’s always on the lookout for better weapons. If he notices one of his
opponents is wielding something particularly sweet (say, a level 28+ magical
weapon), he will engage that opponent and ignore everyone else until he’s taken
the weapon for himself. Otherwise, he will just focus on killing whoever is
closest and repeating that until there is no one else to kill.</p>

<p>This obsession with magic weapons stems in part from the fact that Kazuul used
to own a legendary sword named Gorgorin the Shatterer. He lost it in a battle
against Hainard, one of Pelor’s exarchs. He’s still sore about that, and looking
for a way to either get his sword back or to find a suitably awesome
replacement.</p>

<p>Kazuul’s current weapons are quite awesome already: there’s The Tooth of Grom, a
sword forged from the tooth of a fire titan lord, and The World Splitter, an axe
taken from Clangeddin Silverbeard, one of Moradin’s Exarchs.</p>

<p>There’s an ancient prophecy which proclaims that when Kazuul recovers Gorgorin,
he will use it to slay Demogorgon and then displace Yeenoghu as the lord of
gnolls. This prophecy has caused lots of infighting amongst demons, and there
have been several failed attempts by all factions involved to find the blade’s
current hiding place.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Kazuul is a Large Elemental Humanoid with the Demon tag, making him an official
demon. He’s a Level 28 Elite Soldier with 528 HP. He has Darkvision and demonic
Variable Resistance 10, switchable 3x/encounter. He has ground and fly speeds of
5.</p>

<p>He has two basic attacks with his sweet magic weapons: the <strong>Tooth of Grom</strong>
(Reach 2 vs. AC) does physical damage and forces the target to make a melee
basic attack against a target of Kazuul’s choice on a hit; the <strong>World
Splitter</strong> (reach 2 vs. AC) also does physical damage and inflicts a -4 AC
penalty (save ends). <strong>Wrath of Kazuul</strong> allows him to attack with both weapons
in a single standard action. Oh, and <strong>Threatening Reach</strong> allows him to make
opportunity attacks against any enemy he can reach.</p>

<p>If his enemies are beyond the reach of his blades, Kazuul can attack with
<strong>Abyssal Flames</strong> (area burst 3 within 20 vs. Reflex) at will, doing fire
damage on a hit. He also has a couple of handy spells for use when he gets
closer:</p>

<p><strong>Word of Doom</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Will; encounter) does heavy physical damage
and allows Kazuul to crit against the targets on a natural roll of 15-20 (save
ends). This is scarier than it might sound for someone used to 3.x! In Fourth
Edition, criticals happen only on a natural 20. Only a handful of powers in the
entire game increase that range. Word of Doom is the only one I can think of
that widens it this much.</p>

<p><strong>Vortex of Blades</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Reflex; enemies only; encounter) does
double the damage of a basic attack and stuns (save ends). Simple, but still
scary: stun (save ends) is a pretty serious condition.</p>

<h2 id="thrarak">Thrarak</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-demogorgon-thrarak.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Thrarak’s origins are closely tied to the mythological origns for <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/26/ettin.html">ettins</a>
that I wrote about during the first Monster Manual/Vault Let’s Read. It starts
with Demogorgon fighting the god Amoth, who split his head in two. Before that
wound had even healed, the earth primordial Storralk ambushed him and tried to
take him down.</p>

<p>As the linked post says, Demogorgon defeated the would-be usurper handily, and
bound his broken but still-living form under his throne. It was Dagon who gave
him the idea for a bit of extra cruel punishment: using a ritual provided by
Dagon, Demogorgon caused the first Ettins to be born from Storralk’s spilled
blood, and to scatter through the world. Each one contains a small fraction of
Storralk’s essence, so whenever an ettin feels pain, Storralk’s body feels it as
well.</p>

<p>One of those first ettins chose to stay at Demogorgon’s side, and to seek his
favor by alternatively healing and cutting Storralk’s flesh. This eventually got
his attention and Demogorgon made her one of his exarchs: Thrarak, the Flayed
Maiden.</p>

<p>Thrarak is specifically the Exarch of Ameul, the cunning head. She acts as
Demogorgon’s emissary of vengeance, going after mortals and other entities that
have angered the Prince of Demons or those who have the potential to become
threats in the future. An expert torturer, she fights using twin lashes and
yelling streams of maddening lore that’s dangerous to hear. She prefers to focus
on one opponent at a time, which will either be the target of her master’s ire
or the closest available enemy. Once she chooses a target she will ignore any
other enemies to focus on it.</p>

<p>Legend has it that if Thrarak is slain and her heart burned upon Demogorgon’s
throne, Storralk will finally break free of his prison. Freeing him could be an
important step in defeating Demogorgon himself.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Thrarak is a Large Elemental Humanoid (giant) and a Level 26 Elite Brute with
596 HP. She has all the traits common to all Ettins: trained Perception,
darkvision, ground speed 8, and the Dual Brain and Double Actions traits
described in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/26/ettin.html">original ettin post</a>.</p>

<p>Her basic melee attack is the <strong>Lash of Ruin</strong> (Reach 3 vs. AC) which does
physical damage, knocks prone, and dazes for a turn on a hit. She can sometimes
increase her rythm and perform a <strong>Lashing Flurry</strong> maneuver (close burst 3
vs. AC; recharge 5-6), dealing physical damage and dazing (save ends) all she
hits.</p>

<p>Once per encounter she can perform a <strong>Howl of Madness</strong> (Close Blast 5
vs. Will), which does psychic damage, slides the targets 3 squares, and forces
them to make a melee basic attack against a target of Thrarak’s choice.</p>

<p>Those ettin traits I linked to are quite important to all of this: Thrarak has
two full turns per round and some resistance to restrictive conditions. She can
do a lot, which makes her dangerous to those enemies she’s focusing on. She
should be put in charge of a monster team who can keep the remaining PCs off her
back.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have one encounter for each Exarch:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 25: Thrarak, 1 abyssal rotfiend, and 2 nycademons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 27: Kazuul, 1 marilith, and 1 balor.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It feels appropriate to add a whole bunch of minions to either encounter, if you
think they’re not dangerous enough.</p>

<p>I think I like these two as villains more than I like Dorensain, Orcus’
exarch. Mechanically, Thrarak is just an epic ettin, but she has an interesting
backstory tied to her people’s mythological origins. Kazuul’s magic weapon
obsession is also interesting, and the Gorgorin lore has a lot of potential as
an adventure hook.</p>

<p>GURPS uses a fairly traditional initiative system to determine who goes first in
combat. Like all such systems, it works well for “real-time” gaming, but it
tends to get in the way of good “flow” for a Play-by-Post or other asynchronous
game.</p>

<p>In the past I tried to solve that by having players declare 3-5 turns’ worth of
actions in advance and resolving those on my side, but that ended up being a lot
of work and after a while I burned out on it.</p>

<p>It was at about this time that I first read Lancer, and noticed it used an
interesting initiative system. One of the PCs always acts first in a turn,
followed by an enemy. We alternate that way until all people on one side have
acted, and then the remaining combatants on the other side act one after the
other. The players themselves decide who acts during each “player activation”,
and the GM decides who acts during each enemy activation. The order in which
characters act can therefore vary from turn to turn, but the order of
<em>activations</em> always remains the same.</p>

<p>I’d later find out this model was known as “Popcorn Initiative”. It worked well
for me in the couple of sessions of real-time Lancer I ran, and I’d get a lot
more experience with it when I joined a forum game of Zeitgeist using D&amp;D 4th
Edition rules.</p>

<p>Popcorn Initiative works extremely well in that game. Post flow during combat is
pretty much uninterrupted as long as there’s anyone available to post. We get
through a whole combat round in a single day if everyone is on point, a
formidable pace for an asynchronous game.</p>

<p>It worked so well, it made me think I’d only run an async GURPS game if I could
use popcorn initiative in it. And it turns out adding popcorn initiative to
GURPS is not hard at all!</p>

<h2 id="the-rule">The Rule</h2>

<p>Instead of using Basic Speed values to determine turn order, use the system
described at the start of this post, and repeated here for ease of reference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A PC always goes first, followed by an enemy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two sides then alternate taking their turns until all members of one side
have finished.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining combatants then take their turns one after the other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat the above procedure for each 1-second round in the combat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Players decide which PC acts on each player turn. The GM decides who acts on
each enemy turn. The order doesn’t have to remain constant from second to
second.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Traits and maneuvers that give extra actions or extra attacks all affect the
character’s <em>own</em> turn, as normal. A character’s defenses “reset” at the start
of their turn as usual. Surprise still works the same, and limits your actions
in the same way. All this rule change is how to determine the order in which
turns happen in a 1-second round.</p>

<p>If the battle involves one or more characters with Enhanced Time Sense, then
all of them get to go before the less enhanced combatants, using the rules above
among themselves. It effectively splits the second into two “sub-rounds”.</p>

<p>Having a high Speed here is still useful because it gives you more Dodge and
more Move. Changes to Basic Speed cost the same as under the standard rules.</p>

<h2 id="popcorn-examples">Popcorn Examples</h2>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: A party of four fantasy adventurers fights a group of 6 orcs. The
heavily armored warrior PC goes first and positions himself to protect his
squishier buddies. An orc goes next, then a PC, and so on until all PCs have
acted. The final two orcs act one after the other.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: Two of the orcs in the battle above attack the warrior, who
blocks once and parries once. This leaves him with penalties for further
defenses. If he is not the first to act next round, the penalties will stay with
him until he does take his turn.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong>: The same four adventurers meet a Giant Enemy Crab who has Extra
Attack 1. Again one of the PCs goes first. The crab goes next, and he can make 2
attacks during his turn as in the normal rules. Then the remaining PCs act.</p>

<p><strong>Example 4</strong>: A group of 6 WW2 British Commandos ambushes a patrol squad of 8
Nazi soldiers. The Nazis are surprised and are considered Mentally Stunned as
per the standard rules. Though the GM gets to choose the order in which the
enemy soldiers act, all they can do on their turns is attempt to recover from
the stun.</p>

<p><strong>Example 5</strong>: A 6-person squad of the Solar Patrol runs into a pack of three
homicidal robots while exploring a ghost spaceship! All of the robots have
Enhanced Time Sense, and so does one of the PCs who is a robot themselves. So
the PC robot acts first, then the three enemy robots, and then the rest of the
PCs.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is definitely a system I want to try out when I next GM an async GURPS
game. I tried to change the standard rules as little as possible. Lancer does a
few more things, like giving certain powerful enemies multiple activations per
round, but I want to experiment with this base version before I try doing that
in GURPS.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>We got to the Big Cheese of this book quite early, for his name starts with D:
it’s Demogorgon! He’s been in the game since the days of AD&amp;D 1st Edition. The
name became quite famous when Stranger Things aired, though I don’t think it
refers to the same creature.</p>

<p>This entry is like the Orcus entry in the MM1: It includes not only the stats
for the titular demon lord but also its associates, aspects, exarchs, and even
cultists. I’m going to go through them in reverse order, starting with the
cultists and moving up the levels.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Demogorgon is a demon lord’s demon lord. His credo is quite simple: through
strength, cruelty and slaughter the strong prosper and the weak die. Be strong,
be cruel, and slaughter the weak. That doesn’t mean he’s stupid, though! Each
head has its own personality and highly developed intellect: Aameul is cunning
but brutal and Hethradiah brutal but cunning. They hate each other and argue a
lot but generally end up working towards compatible goals.</p>

<p>Demogorgon also has another business partner who is not himself, which makes him
a bit unique among demon lords: Dagon, a Demon Lord inspired by the fishy entity
of Lovecraftian fame. A keeper of secrets and cosmic mysteries, he shares these
secrets with Demogorgon, but only whispers a given secret to one of the
heads. This keeps their mutual hatred and jealousy going strong, and furthers
Dagon’s own goals. Their servants and cults can be found cooperating some times.</p>

<p>We’ll eventually discuss the big bosses in more detail, but for now let’s begin
by looking at their cults.</p>

<h3 id="cults-of-demogorgon">Cults of Demogorgon</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-demogorgon-cultists.png"/>

</figure>

<p>Demogorgon’s cults gain prominence when war or other wide-ranging disasters
ravage the land, as people turn to him in a desperate attempt to survive and end
up becoming murderous marauders themselves. I imagine this tends to prolong the
problem that caused the cult to rise in the first place. These cultists wander
around like berserking pirates, pillaging and destroying everything in their
path. What makes them different from, say, gnolls? Well, they’re more interested
in taking your stuff than in eating you, and unlike gnolls or orcs they’re a
very diverse crowd.</p>

<p>Members include individuals from any of the “civilized” species as well as
troglodytes, kuo-toa and other aggressive humanoids. Note that none of them
“naturally” worship Demogorgon: even troglodytes and kuo-toa typically venerate
other deities. This means that every cultist of Demogorgon is a heretic to their
own people. A lof of them were probably press-ganged into the cult during one of
those raids I mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>There are also some cultists who go deeper into the demon lord’s mysticism,
believing that like their boss they are of two minds: a civilized mind who acts
as a shackle to a an instinctive, destructive second self. Some try to explore
this duality, while others try to cast of these shackles entirely, worshipping
only Hethradiah, the most aggressive of the two heads.</p>

<p>Whatever their individual views, these cultists are all Chaotic Evil by any
reasonable definition of the alignment.</p>

<h3 id="cults-of-dagon">Cults of Dagon</h3>

<p>Dagon has his own cults too, and these are as Innsmouthy as you’d expect. His
temples are undewater, though they include air-filled rooms to accommodate
visiting terrestrial worshippers. These tend to congregate in coastal
communities, and to sacrifice sapients to their master. Dagon’s demands grow
with time, forcing his cultists to perform ever greater sacrifices in order to
avoid being swallowed by tidal waves or other disasters sent by their overlord.</p>

<p>His worshippers also frequently include wizards and sages willing to bargain
with him for some of those cosmic secrets. These tend to rise to the position of
cult leaders. The most powerful among them might be able to visit Dagon
personally in his doubly-abyssal domains, and barter legendary artifacts for the
lore they seek.</p>

<p>Yeah, Vecna hates Dagon and their cults fight a lot. How did you guess?</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get quite a few cultist stat blocks here, all human. You can easily combine
them with standard stat blocks from other humanoid species to get the diversity
hinted at in the lore, or add the signature traits of those humanoids to the
Demogorgon-flavored stat blocks from this entry.</p>

<h3 id="abyssal-marauder">Abyssal Marauder</h3>

<p>Abyssal marauders roam the land in loose warbands, and the sea in rickety
warships they barely know how to sail. When they see a village or ship, they
attack, kill everyone, take what they can and burn what they can’t. In doing
this they honor their demonic overlord.</p>

<p>Some pirate captains or land-bound warlords manage to hire bands of abyssal
marauders to bolster their ranks for big raids, paying them mostly with the
promise of plentiful loot and chances to kill people. Unless they can keep
providing that loot between battles, though, it’s very hard to keep the
marauders in line.</p>

<p>Marauders are Level 6 Skirmishers with 69 HP and a speed of 6. Their piecemeal
protections are equivalent to leather armor, and they carry a long spear and a
pair of throwing axes to battle.</p>

<p>Both the <strong>spear</strong> (reach 2 vs. AC) and the <strong>throwing axes</strong> (Ranged 5/10
vs. AC) count as basic attacks, and both allow the marauder to shift 1 square on
a hit. They’ll usually open the fight with a <strong>Howling Charge</strong>, which allows
them to throw an axe at someone and immediately charge them with the spear.</p>

<p>When bloodied, marauders are taken over by a <strong>Death Fury</strong>, which allows them
to make two basic melee attacks per standard action at a -2 penalty to each. It
also forbids them from using any of their other attacks!</p>

<p>Reach weapons and plentiful shifting make marauders work well when paired with a
“wall” of sturdier allies, like the shrieking cultists we’ll see below.</p>

<h3 id="berserker-prelate-of-demogorgon">Berserker Prelate of Demogorgon</h3>

<p>Prelates are priest-types, preaching the credo of Demogorgon to their fellow
cultists as their leader or (in the book’s words) their “spiritual pet”. Unlike
the cultist priests of other demon lords, berserker prelates lead from the front
and join the fight alongside their flock.</p>

<p>Prelates are Level 8 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 86 HP. Their speed
is 5, they wear hide, and carry a big club into battle.</p>

<p>The <strong>greatclub</strong> is their basic melee attack, and allows them to push the
target 1 square on a hit. At range they fling <strong>Abyssal Bolts</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Will) that do physical damage and slide the target 2 squares on a hit.</p>

<p>Their leadery skill is <strong>Bloodletter’s Call</strong> (Close Burst 3). Against enemies,
this is an attack vs. Will that does psychic damage and dazes for a turn. On
allies, it instead acts as a buff giving them +2 to attack for a turn.</p>

<p>As the name might imply, berserker prelates are gripped by the same <strong>Death
Fury</strong> as their marauder buddies when bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="shrieking-cultist-of-demogorgon">Shrieking Cultist of Demogorgon</h3>

<p>These psychos have given up on any semblance of restraint and rationality,
seeking to emulate Hethradiah, the most violent of Demogorgon’s heads. When a
lot of them gather, people who are themselves on the path to madness might
discern the demonic hymn hidden in their collective shrieking.</p>

<p>These cultists are Level 7 Brutes with 94 HP. They wear mail, so their speed
is 5. They wield a <strong>greataxe</strong> and carry a brace of <strong>javelins</strong>, which are
basic attacks doing heavy damage as expected of a Brute. Once per encounter they
can intensify their incoherent screaming into a <strong>Howl of Fury</strong> (close blast 3
vs. Will) that does psychic damage and immobilizes the targets for a turn on a
hit.</p>

<p>They can also make their fury <em>solid</em> with <strong>Death Wrath</strong> (close burst 1
vs. AC; encounter), which does physical damage and creates a zone of horrible
noise that moves with the cultist, in effect working like an aura 1. Anyone
caught inside takes 5 physical damage.</p>

<p>Shrieking Cultists lack the <strong>Death Fury</strong> trait from their other two
correligionists: for all practical purposes, they’re <em>always</em> in this state
already.</p>

<h3 id="doom-flayer">Doom Flayer</h3>

<p>Doom Flayers are wizards who worship Dagon to gain access to his secrets,
offering sacrifices to him and helping further his plots. They will likely tell
you they are perfectly rational and can stop the demon worship any time they
want.</p>

<p>They’re Level 8 Artillery with 65 HP, wielding a <strong>dagger</strong> for emergencies and
otherwise using a large collection of Dagon-themed spells to fight:</p>

<p><strong>Force Lash</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex) does force damage and slows the target for
a turn.</p>

<p><strong>Grasping Tentacles</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6) does physical
damage and immobilizes (save ends). Until the target saves, any enemy starting
its turn adjacent to the target is slowed (save ends).</p>

<p><strong>Doom Foretold</strong> (Ranged 10; minor; encounter) auto-hits and makes the target
grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p><strong>Churning Vortex</strong> (area burst 1 within 10 vs. Reflex; encounter) does physical
damage, slides 1 square, and knocks the targets prone on a hit. It does half
damage on a miss.</p>

<p>The encounter powers work as a good fight-opener, and you should use them that
way or you might miss the chance to do so if the party decides to focus fire on
the flayer.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>This entry has a bunch of sample encounters but only two are cultist-themed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: 1 abyssal marauder, 2 shrieking cultists, 1 berserker prelate, and 1
tiefling darkblade. Remember what I said about using other stat blocks as
cultists?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: 1 doom flayer, 2 troglodyte thrashers, 2 abyssal marauders, 1 gnaw
demon. And here’s that Dagon/Demogorgon partnership at work.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>D&amp;D has a lot of hordes of murderous raiding cultists, and making them different
from each other can be a tough job for a writer. I feel they succeeded here,
though. Demogorgon’s cultists are the only ones with a diverse membership by the
book, and the Death Fury trait makes them look properly “two-faced”, going from
canny fighters to frothing nutjobs as the fight progresses.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Darkmantles feel like a very AD&amp;D kind of monster, but I can’t find mention of
them in the Monster Manuals for those editions. Either they appeared in a
supplement, or they’re actually introduced in 3.x.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The darkmantle is a creature native to the Shadowfell, which predictably means
it likes hanging out in dark places such as caves and underground ruins. Being
both pointy and membranous, they hunt by hanging from the ceiling disguised as
stalactites and dropping on unsuspecting prey from above.</p>

<p>Darkmantles have animal intellect, and are about as smart as dogs. As such,
they’re often tamed by shadow- and underground-themed humanoids to act as
guards and/or living traps.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>There’s only one stat block here, so we’ll get right to it.</p>

<h3 id="darkmantle-enveloper">Darkmantle Enveloper</h3>

<p>This is described as a Large Shadow Magical Beast, though I think it should be
labeled a Beast instead. Beasts “look and behave like animals”, and magical
beasts “look like animals and behave like people”. Well, the label is just
descriptive, so it makes no difference in the stats.</p>

<p>The Darkmantle Enveloper is a Level 8 Lurker with 76 HP. It has both Blindsight
8 from echolocation, and Darkvision. It emits a <strong>Shadowy Field</strong> aura (5) that
reduces bright light to dim light, which I guess it only activates once its
presence is known. It has ground and climb speeds of 2, and a fly speed of 6.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>Tentacle Lash</strong> that does regular physical damage, but
the main event is <strong>Engulf</strong> (melee 1 vs. Reflex), which does the same damage
and grabs the target. The target is considered blinded until the grab ends, and
the creature can spend a minor action to sustain it and deal an automatic 5
damage to the target. Only one victim can be engulfed at once.</p>

<p>If the victim’s buddies try to help them, the darkmantle can use a <strong>Shadowcry</strong>
(close burst 3 vs. Fortitude; minor action; encounter) to keep them at bay. This
does light thunder damage and dazes for a turn.</p>

<p>When someone manages to damage the darkmantle, it can react with a
<strong>Shadowjump</strong> (recharge 5-6), which allows it to teleport 6 squares to a space
in darkness or dim light. The creature arrives invisible and with its aura
turned off, both of which last for a turn.</p>

<p>One small mechanical issue: since Engulf is not a basic attack, it can’t be used
as part of a charge. This could be interpreted to say that the darkmantle can’t
drop from the ceiling and use Engulf, but that’s clearly not the intention
here. I’d say the attack <em>can</em> be used as part of a “drop charge”.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is level 6, and feature a pair of darkmantles acting as
guards for a trio of duergar.</p>

<p>Eh… it’s another underground ambusher that disguises itself as a rock
formation. The most a darkmantle has ever interested me is when it was part of a
joke about gygaxian deathtrap dungeons (“the stalactites are darkmantles; the
stalagmites ropers…”).</p>
