<p>I don’t remember seeing these specific devils in earlier editions, but that
might just mean they were from a late 3e book.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>This is not the first silver-tongued manipulative devil we’ve seen, not by far,
but it seems to be the most specialized one. Vizier devils are rarely found in
the Nine Hells - they’re always out in the world serving and tempting ambitious
mortals.</p>

<p>Like all other MM3 devils, the lore text on this one is a bit obsessed with sin
and with the idea that sinners going to hell and becoming devils is a natural
occurrence, which isn’t really something that was present in earlier 4e monster
books. As we saw in previous readings, in 4e Hell is a cosmic aberration. Devils
don’t come from sinners, and they get their souls either by having mortals sign
contracts or through force. Those souls get used as currency, fuel, and magic
item ingredients, not to make new devils.</p>

<p>This makes these creatures members of Hell’s sales department, just like
imps. The main difference is that viziers are stronger, smarter, and bolder in
their suggestions. I imagine having a bound vizier devil instead of a mere bound
imp is a major status symbol among deluded diabolists.</p>

<p>If you’re into the sin thing (which was the standard in 3e and maybe earlier),
they you can go with the lore in this entry that says that vizier devils are
genuinely helpful at first but then begin to steer their “masters” down more
evil and sinful paths with the goal of making them go to Hell after they die.</p>

<p>If you prefer the standard 4e lore, then the main difference is that vizier
devils will try to get their masters to sign a soul contract either as a
pre-condition to their service, or as an “upsell” in exchange for greater power
or greater hellish support at some point after they begin their work as
advisors.</p>

<p>A 4e-style, contract-based vizier devil is ironically less treacherous than the
temptation-based 3e-style one. Their mortal bosses are likely to <em>already</em> be
evil in the first place, so they need little tempting. And after the contract is
signed there is even less need for deception, as the devil already got what it
wanted and only needs to fulfill its part of the bargain.</p>

<p>Vizier devils look like tieflings with slightly exaggerated fiendish features,
and that actually makes them good at blending in. In combat, they’re
spellcasters with a repertoire focusing on fire and charm magic. They always
have a contingency plan or two to escape if the fight goes against them, and
never fight to the death if they can help it.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Vizier devils are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils), and Level 7 Controllers
(leaders). They have Resist Fire 10, Darkvision, a ground speed of 6, and a
teleport speed of 4. That’s more or less the same set of traits as a legion
devil, so maybe they’re related.</p>

<p>They wield <strong>Scepters</strong> that work as implements and can be used to bash people
in melee. This does physical damage and slides the target 1 square on a
hit. Their basic ranged attack is a <strong>Helfire Bolt</strong> that does fire damage and
forces the target to grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>They can also use a <strong>Word of Command</strong> at will, which lets them choose a
creature within 2 squares, slide it 3 squares and have it make a free melee
basic attack against another creature of the devil’s choice. The text says “a
creature”, which means this can target either an ally or an enemy with this. And
the thing is an <em>effect</em>, not an <em>attack</em>, which means it works
automatically.</p>

<p>Word of Command does require a standard action, but it’s still a good choice if
the vizier is accompanied by big bruisers or if the party includes PCs with good
basic attacks. It’s even better if the party includes some of those Essentials
martial classes, since they’re all about having awesome melee basic attacks with
all sorts of special riders.</p>

<p>The vizier’s leader-ish abilities are <strong>Hellfire Enchantment</strong> and <strong>Infernal
Advice</strong>. The first is a minor action that grants an ally within 5 squares a +5
fire damage bonus to all its melee attacks until the end of its next turn. The
other is a reaction that allows an ally to reroll a missed attack with a +2
bonus. Hellfire Enchantment is an awesome ability to use on allies that have
multiple attacks on their turns! All of them will get the bonus.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m not gonna lie, these devils feel a bit redundant. Their concept is exactly
the same as all the other sly manipulators, and the only difference is their
power level. They’re the “level 7 sly manipulator”, where imps are “level 3” an
the others are stronger. I also don’t like the emphasis on sin in this book,
because it’s a 3e-ism.</p>

<p>That said, a vizier devil’s stats make it an interesting monster to fight and
they can easily be reskinned into infernal warlord types. They go really well
with melee bruiser monsters that can make multiple attacks. Those can be part of
the entourage of their mortal bosses, or other devils.</p>

<p>This is another devil that breaks the “morphology” guidelines, but it’s kind of
unavoidable this time. After all, they’re associated with Baalzebul, Lord of the
Flies.</p>

<p>Each swarm devil is a singular mind controlling the bodies of an entire swarm of
acidic fiendish flies. According to the book, they’re formed when an angel is
caught lying to its divine master and is torn apart as punishment. The angel’s
soul falls to the Hells and the bits of its body become flies. They roam the
stagnant pools of Maladomni, the Seventh Hell, eternally starving but unable to
die. They can only leave when their master orders them on a mission, which makes
them very happy because it allows them to fly free and eat people for the
duration. It helps that “eating people” usually <em>is</em> the mission. It’s what
swarm devils do best, after all.</p>

<p>Swarm Devils fight by just kinda walking into enemies’ spaces and letting their
flies do the work, and by spewing flies at people they can’t easily reach that
way. As swarms, they’re hard to fight unless you have area-effect weapons and
spells.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>These creatures are Large Immortal Magical Beasts (Devil, Swarm) and Level 18
Skirmishers with 174 HP. They have Darkvision and a flight speed of 10 (hover),
and 20 acid resistance.</p>

<p>They also have the standard swarm traits on top of that: half damage and
immunity to forced movement from melee and ranged attacks; Vulnerable 10 to
close and area attacks; a swarm aura; the ability to occupy the same space as
other characters; and the ability to squeeze through small openings without
slowing down.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura (1) deals 10 acid damage to enemies caught inside. I
think being in the same space as the swarm also counts as being inside the
aura. Their basic <strong>Slams</strong> do no immediate damage, and inflict 10 ongoing acid
damage.</p>

<p>They can channel <strong>Acidic Curses</strong> through their acid, targetting someone taking
ongoing acid damage with a ranged attack that deals psychic damage and inflicts
a -2 penalty to attacks for a turn. Twice per encounter they can <strong>Spew Flies</strong>
in a Close Burst 3, inflicting ongoing acid damage and forcing targets to grant
combat advantage (save ends both).</p>

<p>The “just walking into people” tactic is represented by <strong>Swarm Shift</strong>
(recharge 5+), in which it shifts its speed and deals 15 acid damage to anyone
they pass through.</p>

<p>A good tactic for them is to move in, hit a few people with the slam or spew,
use Swarm Shift to move out of the scrum and keep flinging curses at anyone
who’s melting. Reapply the acid as necessary.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Fly-themed fiends for the Lord of the Flies, nothing unexpected. The
acid/psychic damage mechanic is mildly interesting.</p>

<p>This is another one of those monsters that’s all about blurring the lines
between fiends. These monsters are devils, but they break the design rule that
says devils have a human-like appearance.</p>

<p>Slime Devils are amorphous oozes, though unlike most “true” oozes they’re
sapient and rather smart. They probably originated in some past edition as well,
because they’re the second devil said to be formed from the souls of dead
sinners (which is not a 4e thing). They arise from the mixture of the toxic mud
in the swamps of Minauros with the hatred that seeps from the souls of corrupt
inquisitors who are stuck there. Their abilities make them adept interrogators
and torturers, since they can read the minds of people they envelop and inflict
intense pain on them.</p>

<p>They’re often summoned to act in this capacity by villains in the world, so
they’ll be found alongside those villains’ guards and jailers. In Hell, they
travel with burlier devils, and with those whose controller-y powers can hold
enemies down to be engulfed.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>A Slime Devil is a Medium Immortal Humanoid (Devil, Ooze), and a Level 16 Lurker
with 123 HP. The lore does say their base form is vaguely humanoid, but still
I’d probably classify them as Magical Beasts instead. Either way, it doesn’t
change their other stats.</p>

<p>They have Darkvision, ground and swim speeds of 6, and Resist Acid 20 instead of
the usual devil fire resistance. Their <strong>Mercurial Body</strong> trait allows them to
ignore difficult terrain and not provoke opportunity attacks when
moving. They’re still vulnerable to a Fighter’s Combat Challenge or other
similar abilities, but non-defenders can’t hold them in place.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Caustic Slam</strong> that targets Fortitude and does acid
damage. They can also stretch into <strong>Acidic Tendrils</strong> that attack up to three
creatures at Reach 3, deal immediate and ongoing acid damage, and pull them 2
squares.</p>

<p>The slime devil’s main trick is <strong>Diabolical Engulfment</strong>, which targets reflex
and grabs on a hit. Grabbed targets are dazed and take ongoing 10 acid damage
while the grab lasts. The creature occupies the same space as the victim, and
pulls the victim along when it moves. Attacks that hit the slime devil deal half
damage to it and half damage to the victim.</p>

<p>As a minor action (1/round), the slime devil can use <strong>Scour the Mind</strong> on its
grabbed victim. This targets Will. On a hit, the devil poses a question to the
victim, who must choose between answering truthfully and taking psychic
damage. The amount of damage is the same as a basic attack, which is a lot for a
minor-action power. The creature can do this and still use its basic attack to
fight off the victim’s friends.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Lore-wise, kinda meh. I’m not a fan of bringing the old “fiends come from the
souls of sinners” cliches back into D&amp;D. They’re more interesting mechanically,
because I love attack powers that force PCs to choose between two bad outcomes.</p>

<p>Looks like the Monster Manual 3 is all about blurring the lines between
fiends. We have a devil who became a demon lord, demons who became devils, and
now a devil who behaves like a demon. I haven’t run into rage devils before. If
they appeared in previous editions, it must have been in a late MM or a
specialized supplement.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A Rage Devil is what happens when you take a standard Hell Knight and inject
demon ichor into it. They’re hulking brutes who are constantly angry and delight
in carnage. In other words, they’re pretty much demons, or they would be if
their flesh wasn’t bound with empowered Supernal sigils that keep them pointed
in the right direction.</p>

<p>These creatures are the result of an infernal experiment to create more powerful
shock troops to throw into the meatgrinder of the Blood War. They’re actually a
little weaker than a standard hell knight, making them a bit of a failed
experiment. Maybe they adapted the process for the mass-produced version so it
works on legion devils instead.</p>

<p>Rage devils are used as heavy elements attached to legion devil forces, and are
often placed under the command of hell knights. In their free time, these things
roam Avernus in search of demon stragglers or anyone else they can get away with
smashing.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Rage Devils are Large Immortal Humanoids (Devils), and Level 11 Brutes with 138
HP. They have Darkvision and Resist Fire 20, but they can’t fly. Their ground
speed is 6.</p>

<p>These devils are heavily armored and fight with <strong>Disrupting Mauls</strong> whose basic
attacks strip all of the target’s resistances for a turn! They have a special
technique named <strong>Demonscourge Crush</strong> (recharge 4+), which deals the same
damage as a basic attack, weakens, and strips all resistances (save ends
both). Another maneuver is <strong>Maul Storm</strong> an at-will Close Burst 2 that deals
some damage and pushes targets 3 squares. If they’re bloodied, they’re also
knocked prone.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Blood Rage</strong> passive trait makes them deal extra damage on all attacks
against bloodied opponents.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Rage devils are indeed an excellent weapon both against demons and against other
devils, as well as any creature type that relies on high elemental
resistances. Behavior-wise they tend to be on the shallower end of the <em>demon</em>
cliche pool, with only their binding rituals preventing them from turning on
their devilish masters.</p>

<p>As I said above, I’d probably say most rage devils are modified legion devils,
because baseline Hell Knights are both stronger and smarter than these things,
so turning a Hell Knight into a Rage Devil is a bit of a waste.</p>

<p>This is the first time I come across passion devils, but they give me strong 3e
vibes.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Do you want to employ seductive and manipulative devils in your villainous
schemes, but feel that succubi are too nice? Fierna, archdevil ruler of
Phlegethos, sure did! In order to fulfill her very specific needs, she created
Passion Devils.</p>

<p>The reason these creatures give me a strong 3e-or-earlier vibe is that they feel
like the sort of grid-filling exercise that was very common in those
games. Succubi were considered demons back then, so when they needed to fill the
“seductive manipulator” niche on the devil side they created a completely new
creature.</p>

<p>In 4e, passion devils are kinda like a specialized succubus variant tied to
Fierna. As incarnations of her vanity, they’re made in her image but always have
some extra imperfection in their forms so their mistress remains the fairest of
them all. They’re sent to infiltrate mortal societies just like a succubus, and
they’re also used to replace the leadership of Fierna’s own cults so she can
keep tabs on them. When used as official emissaries and ambassadors, they are
often protected by a unit of bearded devil bodyguards.</p>

<p>The main difference between a baseline succubus and a passion devil is that the
latter have serious anger management issues. When their tempers flare, their
disguises tend to melt away as the passion devil abandons all subtlety and
resorts to force. This is obviously what happens when the PCs thwart their
plans, but it could also happen if they run out of patience while trying to
employ standard succubus strategies. At least their fire powers make them better
combatants than succubi when the jig is up.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>These creatures are Medium Immortal Humanoids with the Devil keyword, and Level
16 Controllers. They have Darkvision, Resist Fire 20, and move at speed 6 on the
ground or in the air. A pretty standard devil toolkit.</p>

<p>They project a charm aura (1) that makes others see them as a <strong>Object of
Desire</strong> and take a -2 penalty to saves against dazing effects.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>claw</strong> that targets Reflex and does fire damage. They
can also be “gentler” and employ a <strong>Fiery Touch</strong> that does less damage and
dominates for a turn. The ability that combos with their aura is <strong>Beckoning
Whispers</strong>, a non-damaging attack against Will that pulls targets 5 squares and
dazes them (save ends).</p>

<p>Finally they have an area attack named <strong>Passion’s Flames</strong>, a Close Burst 3
that deals fire damage and forces any dominated enemies it hits to make melee
basic attacks against targets of the devil’s choice.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the passion devil can <strong>change shape</strong> to appear like a
Medium humanoid. The DC to see through the disguise is a respectable 36, but
it’s less stable than that of a succubus and ends when the devil attacks.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>It’s a Succubus Plus with a temper. Lore-wise they’re Fierna’s trademark
servants, so they fit into any adventure where she’s the main enemy. Otherwise
you might want to use leveled-up succubi from the Monster Vault, or reskin these
into succubi as appropriate.</p>
