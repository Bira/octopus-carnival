<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>I believe Cave Fishers originated in AD&amp;D, one of the many examples of “cave
ceiling fauna” in that edition. Your group might be on the lookout for
darkmantles, spiders and piercers, but they’ll never see the cave fisher
coming. This is their 4e debut.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Cave fishers are nonsapient predatory arthropods about the size of an adult
human. They’re entirely natural and mundane, by the standards of D&amp;D. They hunt
by hiding in cave ceilings, and pulling prey from the ground using either sticky
strands or spear-like appendages.</p>

<p>As the name implies, cave fishers hang out underground. They prefer caves with
high ceilings and plenty of ledges, where they make their nests. They organize
themselves in loose collectives, and newly-mated pairs fly out to look for an
empty ledge to nest in.</p>

<p>The two varieties of cave fisher presented here aren’t different species,
they’re different sexes: anglers are female, and spikers are male. Anglers lay
eggs and watch the nest, hunting only when prey wanders nearby. Spikers range
farther out to look for food.</p>

<p>Cave fishers can’t usually be tamed, but people tend to use meat-based bait to
lure them to caves they want protected and to distract them when passing through
those caves. Hobgoblins sometimes capture fisher eggs and train them from
hatching to serve as living artillery.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Adult cave fishers are Medium Natural Beasts. Spawn old enough to be a threat
are Small. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 6 and a climb speed of 5 with
Spider Climb (5 and 4 for the spawn).</p>

<h3 id="cave-fisher-spawn">Cave Fisher Spawn</h3>

<p>Fisher spawn lead a stressful existence from very early on. A weak individual is
likely to be devoured by its siblings if they get hungry enough.</p>

<p>These Small spawn are Level 2 Minion Brutes. They attack with their <strong>pincers</strong>
and do extra damage against immobilized, restrained, or helpless targets.</p>

<h3 id="cave-fisher-angler">Cave Fisher Angler</h3>

<p>This adult female tends to stick close to the nest, and rely on its ledge for
concealment. To hunt, she lowers a sticky filament to just above head height of
the passing prey, and snaps it around the prey’s neck when they pass
underneath.</p>

<p>Anglers are Level 3 Lurkers with 37 HP. They have the <strong>Sniper</strong> trait, which
ensures they stay hidden if they make a ranged attack from concealment and miss.</p>

<p>This is useful because their <strong>Filament Strangle</strong> counts as a ranged attack! It
has range 5, targets Reflex, and though its initial damage is weak it pulls the
target 3 squares and restrains them (save ends). The pull can be vertical, and
the target can end that movement suspended in midair. This effect can be
sustained with standard actions in subsequent rounds, dealing automatic damage
to the target and pulling them again.</p>

<p>Aside from passing the save, there are few options from escaping the
filament. The victim can teleport or be teleported, which frees them
automatically; or one of their allies can target the filament with an
attack. The filament has the same defenses as the angler, and hitting it frees
the victim but deals no damage to the beast itself.</p>

<p>If an angler does get into melee range of a PC, it can also use its basic
<strong>pincer</strong> attack, which does average damage and has no special effects.</p>

<p>It’s likely that the PCs will only realize an angler is hunting them when the
first victim gets grabbed by a filament. And once that happens it can stay in
full cover atop that ceiling ledge until it has to peek out to try and grab
someone else!</p>

<h3 id="cave-fisher-spiker">Cave Fisher Spiker</h3>

<p>Spikers are the males of the species. Instead of producing a single strand of
filament, they can spit small tangles of it at greater ranges. These either
harden into spikes, or envelop a victim and begin contracting. The creature uses
these techniques to kill its prey and drag the carcass back to its nest.</p>

<p>Spikers are Level 3 Artillery with 37 HP. They have the same Sniper trait as the
angler, and a <strong>Camouflage</strong> trait that gives them +2 to defenses against ranged
and area attacks.</p>

<p>Their basic attacks are a <strong>pincer</strong> in melee, and a <strong>filament spike</strong> at
range. Those contracting filaments are represented by the <strong>Filament Wrap</strong>
attack (recharge 5+), which does no immediate damage but immobilizes the target
and inflicts 5 ongoing damage (save ends both).</p>

<p>Spikers tend to focus their fire on a single victim, since their instinct is to
kill it quickly and make off with the body.</p>

<h3 id="cave-fisher-line-spiker">Cave Fisher Line Spiker</h3>

<p>Hobgoblins that manage to capture a batch of cave fisher eggs like to use a
combination of magic and their ancient beast-taming techniques to turn them into
weapons of war. This results in a specimen that’s less robust than a wild
spiker, but which can follow commands and fire in formation to support the
troops.</p>

<p>Like Spikers are Level 4 Minion Artillery. They have the usual <strong>pincer</strong> melee
attack, and their basic ranged attack is a <strong>slowing spike</strong> that does a bit of
damage and slows for a turn. Once per encounter they can use a <strong>Toppling
Spike</strong> that deals a bit more damage and knocks prone. Since they’re minions,
this should be their first attack. Line spikers want to stay far away from the
front lines and will likely run away rather than engage the PCs in melee.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These cave fishers have enough unique mechanics to distinguish themselves from
other “ceiling fauna”. Their low level makes it likely they’ll be the first such
fauna the PCs meet. They can also inhabit the Underdark, but you might want to
boost their levels if you want to place them there.</p>

<p>Since they’re regulars, your PCs shouldn’t run into lone fishers, at least not
as a full combat encounter. You can make an “all-wildlife” encounter with 2-3
mated pairs at once, or with 1 mated pair and other opportunistic underground
predators. Line spikers, of course, will always be accompanied by squads of
goblinoids including at least one beast tamer.</p>

<p>As I mentioned back in my <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/05/19/cp-red-review.html">Cyberpunk RED review</a>, I felt the game didn’t
quite clear my “Threshold of GURPS”. This particular term is new but the idea
itself is almost exactly 5 years old now. I first mentioned it in <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/21/to-gurps-or-not-to-gurps.html">this
post</a>, where I discussed what makes me want to reach for GURPS in an
adaptation and what makes me look for other systems.</p>

<p>CP RED’s native system is fine! The reason I say it didn’t “clear the threshold”
is that it’s exactly the sort of system and setting described in the “When to
GURPS” section of that 2017 post. It worries about modeling specific concrete
actions, and it worries about the details of how they’re executed. In addition
to this, the system itself doesn’t have any mechanical novelties that aren’t
reproducible in GURPS.</p>

<p>So yeah, while I’d happily play the native system in a one-shot or something
like that, given enough time to prepare I’d prefer to adapt its setting to
GURPS. Talking about how I’d do it is an excellent excuse for an Octopus
Carnival post. It helps that “Cyberpunk” has been one of the genres GURPS set
out to support since its beginnings.</p>

<h2 id="part-1-high-concept">Part 1: High Concept</h2>

<p>Cyberpunk-the-setting is actually a fairly broad place that supports a large
variety of campaigns… but most people seem to be fans of that fairly narrow
slice of stylish street mercs pulling heists for money and/or personal
reasons. I’m not gonna lie, I’m like most people in that regard and so I’m going
to focus on that.</p>

<p>Though the setting has three distinct “eras” now, they all look and feel mostly
the same. The main changes are to the map of Night City and the specific reason
why Johnny Silverhand is raiding Arasaka Tower this time. I think we might be
able to condense that long timeline down a bit.</p>

<p>I’m also going to mix in my personal preferences: I believe cyberpunk doesn’t
<em>have</em> to be a dystopia. This is something you might have gathered from my
previous posts on the subject. I find a lot of cyberpunk settings tend to
confuse “things are bad” with “things can never get better”, and I don’t want to
do that here. For Cyberpunk Red specifically, this ends up resulting into a game
that tells players simple survival is the most they can expect in the same book
where it touts the epic exploits of Bartmoss and Silverhand. I want to treat
them as “iconic” characters in the modern sense, which means that if those
clowns can do all this, so can the PCs.</p>

<p>So here we are: a game about stylish street mercs in the neon-lit future, living
in the fictional Night City. They get into noir-ish situations for money, and
see them through for personal reasons. Hostile factions are mostly corporations,
crime syndicates, or violent themed gangs with corporate ties.</p>

<p>Though PCs often fight for personal stakes they can still end up having a big
impact in the setting<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. PCs who are smart about it and make use of collective
action can make big, lasting, positive change, but even more traditional “band
of badasses” actions will still do something. Not every campaign has to be about
this, but the play style should be possible and supported.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-time-and-place">Part 2: Time and Place</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, it’s Night City in the neon-lit cyber future. Feel free to
use the present date that suits you best. Set it in one of the official dates of
the original game. Set it in 2100 just to spite Transhuman Space. Make it 20XX,
21XX, 22XX, whatever. Or be like William Gibson and never even mention calendar
years. The backstory follows the same general lines of the original, using
relative dates.</p>

<p>Fifty-something years ago the US government descended further into fascist
stupidity than ever before<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Over the next few decades its economy and
environment crashed big time, the entire West Coast seceded, and the government
was either powerless to stop the rise of the megacorps or was actively helping
them along.</p>

<p>Twenty-something years ago Johhny Silverhand performed his one and only raid on
Arasaka Tower, which is more or less a combination of the events from the 2013
and 2023 raids in the original chronology. Arasaka’s nuke blows up, and the
political and literal fallout from this causes heavy backlash against megacorps
in general all over the world. Though many are still around, they can no longer
do whatever the fuck they want without fear of consequence.</p>

<p>Our narrative present is a blend of CP RED and 2077. Night city rebuilt enough
to leave “survival mode”, but it’s still something of a crime capital where the
corps have lots of influence and habitually pay those themed gangs to do their
dirty work. It also has a relatively large “edgerunner” culture with its own
honor codes and a surprisingly large propensity to take jobs from people who are
neither corp- nor gang- affiliated.</p>

<p>There is no shortage of past wars to be a veteran of. The most recent one was
the Corp War that finally died down let’s say 5 years ago. It featured lots of
big corps going at each other, and lots of governments cracking down on them for
it.</p>

<p>Cyberware is common enough that most people sport at least a bit of
“fashionware” from their late teens onwards. Most people won’t cut off healthy
limbs in order to replace them, but there are plenty of maimed veterans and
victims of disease for whom cybernetic replacements are an appealing
prospect. Implanted augmentations are somewhat more common, with the most
popular by far being a GitS-style “cyberbrain” implanted computer.</p>

<p>Guns and armored clothing are common and relatively easy to get in Night
City. This is not generally a <em>good</em> thing, and contributes to the city’s still
dismal violence statistics.</p>

<p>Advertisements are nowhere near as aggressive and explicit as they are in
CP 2077. The real world is bad enough on that front that you don’t need to
further “enhance” it to make a point.</p>

<p>Rache Bartmoss did not “destroy” the NET, because we don’t need to justify rules
changes with an in-setting event. Feral AI gods running on mutated data centers
is too good an image to pass up, though, so those are still there.</p>

<h2 id="part-3-characters-and-their-stuff">Part 3: Characters and Their Stuff</h2>

<p>The core of our rules is going to be GURPS Action, because this is a game about
action heroes. The default is that players get to build their PCs using the
250-point archetypes from GURPS Action 1. This makes them experienced
edgerunners. Greenhorns would use the lower-point templates from Specialists.</p>

<p>Our default ruleset is the one from GURPS Action 2, with the main changes to
that being due to the science fiction elements we’re introducing.</p>

<h3 id="gear-and-cyberware">Gear and Cyberware</h3>

<p>The base tech level is 9, though TL8 gear is still widely available. We’re
either not that far into the future or it’s simply easier to print at home than
the more advanced stuff.</p>

<p>Computers and biotech are at TL10. You can run a mind emulation from a
portable system, and miraculous speed-healing drugs are available. Implants are
drawn from Ultra-Tech and Bio-Tech and are mostly TL9, though some TL10 things
that appear in the CP books would also be available.</p>

<p>Cyberware <em>does not</em> inherently erode your humanity. Not even if you replace
your healthy bits with chrome that’s better than human standard. We use the
usual GURPS mechanics of making implants cost character points at character
creation and both points and money afterwards.</p>

<p>Any template can spend its discretionary points on cyberware from Ultra-Tech or
implants from Bio-Tech. This means most PCs might have one or two implants to
start with, though having none is also a valid choice. Campaigns where the PCs
are meant to start out chromed to the gills might give them 25 or 50 extra
points to spend on starting cyberware.</p>

<h3 id="netrunning">Netrunning</h3>

<p>For hacking, I want a streamlined system. The one from Pyramid #3/21 is a good
start, since one of its goals is to prevent the isolation from the classic
“dungeon crawl” system of CP 2020. However, I want to rely even less on virtual
reality and be more like Ghost in the Shell or CP 2077.</p>

<p>A prospective hacker needs a Neural Interface Implant of some sort (UT,
p. 216). A <em>cyberdeck</em> is either a Computer Implant (Complexity 5, UT p. 215) or
a small computer (Complexity 6, UT p. 22) with a cable jack and a tiny radio
communicator, but without any built-in terminal. The “default” interface tier is
“Augmented Reality”, where the hacker sees the necessary interfaces alongside
the physical world. It’s possible to go “Full Immersion”, which is faster but
leaves the character effectively unconscious in the real world.</p>

<p>Characters running AR have a -2 penalty in opposed tests against characters
running Full Immersion. This is the only game effect, so it’s only worth giving
up your physical senses when you run into an immersed enemy hacker or an enemy
AI (which always counts as immersed). Programs and skills are the same as in the
Pyramid article.</p>

<p>The biggest change from the Pyramid article is in level design. Generally
speaking, “interesting” hackable servers and networks are not directly connected
to the public Internet, and the hacker PC must be on-site to access them. The
smallest and most common target is a single device with a basic firewall,
usually something like a security camera or an automatic door.</p>

<p>Sites with better security link their devices into a slightly larger
network. This is a bit more similar to the design examples of the Pyramid
article, but remember not to make them too large. Such a network might encompass
all security devices in a given floor. No connecting through a megacorp’s
top-secret research server through the vending machines in the lobby!</p>

<p><em>People</em> might also be a valid target for hacking, if they have those
nearly-ubiquitous computer implants. The implant can have any defenses that
could be installed in a computer of the same Complexity and usually contains at
least a basic firewall. Overcoming those defenses might allow netrunners to
“jam” the target’s senses with spurious sensory data or even run the Damage
program. Savvier opposition might link their internal computers into a more
secure network overseen by a friendly hacker, or just turn the their wi-fi off
entirely if it doesn’t confer any combat benefit to them.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>And there you have it. That’s enough to play your classic edgerunners in the
Cyberpunk 2020/RED/2077 setting. Any of the Screamsheets from 2020 or RED should
be readily adaptable, since they have little in the way of stats to begin
with. The gigs and side jobs from 2077 also provide plentiful inspiration and
material for tabletop adventures, and that game’s main plot gives you an idea of
what the sort of “high impact” adventure that leaves a crater looks like. You
might need a bit more thought to devise adventures about organizing collective
action, but they’re also quite possible.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>I first saw the Catoblepas in the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition Monster Manual, and I was
very surprised to learn it’s not a “lolrandom” original monster. It’s a
legendary creature from Ethiopia, described by Roman historians Pliny the Elder
and Claudius Aelianus. I can’t tell whether that makes it part of Ethiopian or
Roman folklore - I’m sure someone more qualified than me can make that
distinction. Their name is derived from a Greek word meaning “to look
downwards”. The plural of catoblepas is <em>catoblepones</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Wikipedia speculates that the original descriptions of the catoblepas might be
referring to a wildebeest or gnu, and you need only look at Wayne England’s
illustration above to know he’s really done his homework. A D&amp;D catoblepas looks
like a wildebeest with a horrible nightmare where its neck and head should
be. Their long necks are always bent down due to the great weight of their
heads, which is where their name comes from.</p>

<p>D&amp;D catoblepones are creatures of shadow and death. They are native to the
Shadowfell but have a natural ability to wander between worlds. People believe
they appear in places that are about to be stuck by tragedy, which is kinda true
since the beast’s breath and gaze are deadly. They’re associated with the Raven
Queen and sometimes show up as part of her entourage.</p>

<p>Despite their reputation as beasts of ill omen, catoblepones are often the
targets of hunting expeditions. Knights hunt them because defeating such a
dangerous beast brings great glory; others perform ritual hunts in honor of the
Raven Queen. Success in these ritual hunts might please the goddess enough that
she grants a blessing to the hunters. A catoblepas can be tracked by the trail
of destruction it leaves, and the Raven Queen is particularly pleased by hunters
who make an effort to mend this damage as they pursue their quarry. To them, she
might grand a mighty boon such as returning someone to life or giving a living
person the ability to foresse their own death and avoid it.</p>

<p>A slain catoblepas reforms in the Shadowfell after a while, and begins wandering
again. Their arrival in a region is often preceded by supernatural phenomena
such as hauntings.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>We get two varieties of catoblepas here.</p>

<h3 id="catoblepas-harbinger">Catoblepas Harbinger</h3>

<p>A classic beast of ill omen, the catoblepas harbinger appears in places full of
hubris to announce they’re about to be hit by famine, war, or other
tragedies. It feeds on pride, anger, despair and other negative emotions,
growing ever larger over time. The poisonous gases it exhales are a byproduct of
this vitriolic diet. I wonder if one of these showed up in the throne room of
the Nerathi emperor before the empire fell.</p>

<p>The Harbinger is a Large Shadow Beast, and a Level 10 Elite Controller with 220
HP. It lumbers along at speed 6 and has Resist Necrotic 5 and Blindsight 5.</p>

<p>Like all catoblepones, the Harbinger emanates the <strong>Raven Queen’s presence</strong>, an
aura (5) that causes anyone inside who fails a death saving throw to lose HP
equal to half their bloodied value. By the standard rules, any creature who hits
their bloodied value in negative HP dies automatically, so this aura makes PCs
die after <em>at most</em> two failed saves instead of the usual three.</p>

<p>When drawn into a fight the harbinger <strong>gores</strong> with its horns and uses its
<strong>poison breath</strong> (close blast 5, recharge 5+), which obviously does poison
damage and inflicts ongoing poison damage.</p>

<p>If someone within 5 squares of the harbinger willingly tries to move away from
it, they’re subject to the beast’s <strong>Final Glance</strong>, an opportunity action that
targets Will. A victim hit by the glance takes 5 necrotic damage and becomes
Vulnerable 5 to all damage (save ends). When they pass that save, they take
another 10 necrotic damage.</p>

<h3 id="catoblepas-tragedian">Catoblepas Tragedian</h3>

<p>This is an older specimen that usually hangs out in places where dead souls
cross over into the Shadowfell, absorbing all the negative emotions that
accompany them. This steady diet has made it grow much larger, and reshaped its
face so it looks like a tragedy mask.</p>

<p>Tragedians are Huge Shadow Beasts, and Level 18 Elite Controllers with 360
HP. They’re mostly identical to harbingers, with larger numbers. They also have
a couple of new abilities.</p>

<p>The first is a <strong>Withering Gaze</strong> used as an active attack against a bloodied
enemy. It targets Will, does a tiny bit of necrotic damage, and weakens (save
ends). After the first failed save, the target is also blinded. After the
second, the target’s hit points drop to -1. And yeah, this does mean they need
to make death saves and it does subject them to the Raven Queen’s Presence
aura. This power recharges whenever no enemy is affected by it.</p>

<p>The second new ability is <strong>Inevitable Call</strong>, a minor action that automatically
hits an enemy within 20 squares and pulls them 3 squares closer to the
Tragedian.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Catoblepones are sticky melee controllers. The basic Harbinger has good powers
to prevent PCs from getting away from them, opening them up from attack from the
other monsters in the fight. It pairs really well with monsters that can do
heavy damage, like brutes and some artillery, because you want to force the PCs
to roll death saves as soon as possible. The Tragedian is all that and more. It
has powers to draw PCs closer to itself and perhaps even force them into
negative HP early.</p>

<p>I used to dismiss these monsters outright because I found the name “catoblepas”
ridiculous, but their 4e incarnation has really evocative lore! I’m a fan now.</p>

            <p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Cambions made their 4e debut in the Monster Manual and were covered
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/07/25/cambion.html">here</a>. This MM3 entry brings us a few more cambion stat blocks, and an extra
helping of lore.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The basic lore hasn’t changed: cambions are the direct offspring of a mortal and
a devil. The first Monster Manual just described the mortal parent as “depraved
or foolish”, but MM3 gets into a little bit more detail on how that
happens. It’s about as horrific as you’d imagine.</p>

<p>The “foolish” mortals are the ones who sign infernal contracts. Many of them
include “make a baby” as part of the price. The “depraved” ones are cultists,
but that doesn’t mean the process is enjoyable for them either. The highly
hierarchical nature of Hell means mortal cultists and lesser devils must
conceive cambions as commanded by their superiors.</p>

<p>Whatever their origin story, cambions mature quickly and are soon put to work
furthering the schemes of their masters. Most of them swear loyalty to Asmodeus
directly and are set loose upon the world to enact various schemes. Fierna and
Belial also walk around with a cambion honor guard.</p>

<p>Cambions associate with lesser devils and mortal diabolists. Those who style
themselves as leaders might have a retinue of guards and advisors. The advisors
are sometimes oni or rakshasa, and in that case they’ll be the true power behind
the throne.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Cambions are Medium Immortal Humanoids with the Devil keyword. They have
darkvision and fire resistance (which is 10 in all stat blocks in this
entry). Their wings give them a flight speed of 8 (clumsy), which means they
fight with their feet on the ground.</p>

<h3 id="cambion-wrathborn">Cambion Wrathborn</h3>

<p>Despite the name, wrathborn are fairly subtle. They can use magic to appear as a
mortal version of their natural appearance, and they use this ability to
infiltrate mortal societies and attain positions of power through intrigue and
violence. They <em>do</em> have a short temper, though, and tend to interpret even the
smallest slight as a grave insult.</p>

<p>Wrathborn are Level 9 Skirmishers with 100 HP. Their disguise ability is named
<strong>Wicked Guise</strong>, and it remains on while the wrathborn is unbloodied. When that
happens, they assume their true form and project an aura (1) of <strong>Burning
Anger</strong>, which deals 5 fire damage to those caught inside.</p>

<p>They fight a bit like extra-mobile infernal warlocks, using a shortsword and a
wand. The basic sword attack is <strong>Pain Blade</strong>, which damages and makes the
target grant combat advantage for a turn on a hit. They can use a maneuver named
<strong>Path of Pain</strong> to shift 4 squares and make a Pain Blade attack at any point
during the shift. The wand shoots <strong>fire bolts</strong> that target Reflex and do fire
damage.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, while bloodied, the wrathborn can also use <strong>Burst Skyward</strong>
to deal fire damage around themselves (Close burst 2 vs. Reflex) and fly 8
squares without provoking opportunity attacks. This is good to avoid getting
surrounded.</p>

<h3 id="chained-cambion">Chained Cambion</h3>

<p>Chained cambions are exactly what it says on the tin: cambions bound up in
chains, with iron masks affixed to their faces. I’m guessing this is what
happens when someone tries to imprison a cambion and it kinda-sorta breaks
free. Their bodies are completely bound, but they can move and fight by
controllng the chains that bind them. Their chief emotion is hate. The only
sound from behind the mask is a hoarse scream of rage. Zero subtlety. Zero
chill.</p>

<p>Chained cambions are Level 10 Controllers with 110 HP. Since they walk around by
moving their chains like spider legs, they lack a flight speed. They’re
surrounded by a <strong>Blinding Field</strong> (aura 3) that makes its covered squares count
as difficult terrain for enemies. Their <strong>Child of Chains</strong> trait makes them get
a +2 attack bonus when immobilized or restrained, as well as a +2 bonus on saves
to end those conditions.</p>

<p>These monsters attack by hitting people with their enchanted chains and
screaming into their minds. Their basic <strong>Chain Lash</strong> attack has a reach of 3,
and if it hits a dazed enemy it also immobilizes them.</p>

<p>The psychic screaming is expressed as two different attacks. <strong>Vile Fetters</strong> is
a reach 5 melee attack that targets Will and does psychic damage. If the target
ends it next turn closer to the cambion than it started, it becomes dazed (save
ends). <strong>Unfettered Scream</strong> (recharge 5+) is a close blast 3 that targets
Fortitude, does psychic damage, pushes 2 squares, and dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>As a minor action the chained cambion can use a <strong>Mind Shackles</strong> spell. It
automatically hits 2 enemies within 5 squares of the cambion. Shackled enemies
take 10 psychic damage at the start <em>and</em> at the end of their turns if they’re
not adjacent to the other shackled enemy at that moment. Each enemy saves
independently from the other, so it’s possible for one of them to be free and
the other still shackled. The first successful save reduces the damage to 5, the
second eliminates it. This power recharges when the cambion is bloodied.</p>

<p>Looks like a chained cambion will want to shackle a pair of enemies and then
keep them apart by interposing himself between then and using Unfettered Scream
to push them away, or Vile Fetters to prevent them from going around.</p>

<h3 id="cambion-infernal-scion">Cambion Infernal Scion</h3>

<p>Sometimes the unfortunate mortal forced to be a cambion parent is a noble or
even a monarch. Infernal scions are an object lesson on why hereditary
government is a bad idea. This one covets Asmodeus’ positition as the ruler of
Hell and is working to supplant him. I guess he’s still a ways away from doing
that.</p>

<p>He’s a Level 12 Elite Soldier with 250 HP, wearing mail and wielding a magic
sword. This <strong>Burning Longsword</strong> does fire damage and marks for a turn. If a
marked enemy tries to ignore the mark, the scion can use <strong>Majestic Stride</strong> to
teleport adjacent to them and hit them with the sword.</p>

<p>In addition to using the sword to mark people, the scion can use <strong>Oath of the
Nine</strong> (minor action, 1/round) to do so. This automatically marks an enemy
within 3 squares and gives them Vulnerable 10 Fire for a turn.</p>

<p>When not bloodied, the scion can use <strong>Dread Command</strong> (Ranged 5 vs. Will, minor
action, 1/round) to dominate an enemy for a turn. Once bloodied he flips out,
losing this ability and replacing it with <strong>Fiend Razor</strong>, which allows it to
make 2 sword attacks with an action. This is an interesting way to implement an
elite’s multi-attack ability.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Cambions are… okay I guess? The mechanics in this entry are interesting, but
the lore doesn’t quite get me going. I feel I can make some use of the infernal
scion, but the others don’t make stories jump to my mind just from reading them.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/05/20/beholder.html">Let&#39;s Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Beholder</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Beholders appear in every 4e Monster Manual and also in the Monster
Vault. They’re apparently too iconic to leave out! In this entry, we get spooky.</p>

<p>There’s no new “general” lore in this entry. Everything it introduces would be
packaged into the Monster Vault as well and we already looked at that lore here.</p>

<h2 id="beholder-spawn">Beholder Spawn</h2>

<p>D&amp;D 5th Edition would introduce that cool bit where beholders reproduce
asexually through nightmares. The MM3 just says that the means of beholder
reproduction are best left unknown. In either case, the result of that process
could be represented by this Beholder Spawn stat block.</p>

<p>These are beholders at the start of their life-cycle, very young and
comparatively weak but already quite smart and evil. You might find them
alongside their parents. Or perhaps they’re banding together for survival,
hoping to last long enough to be the first to reach full size and devour the
rest of their siblings.</p>

<p>In either case they’d be very aware of their fragility and would try to stay
mobile, spread out, and away from the reach of the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Beholder spawn are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts, and Level 15 Minion
Artillery. They have a flight speed of 6, darkvision, and all-around vision
(which means they can’t be flanked).</p>

<p>Like all beholders, they <strong>bite</strong> in melee and fire <strong>eye rays</strong> with a maximum
range of 10. Their rays are a lot simpler than that of a “full” beholder, and do
elemental damage of the same type as one of the types used by their parent.</p>

<p>If a spawn is hit or missed by a close or area attack, they can use <strong>Desperate
Flight</strong> as an interrupt to shift 2 squares. This means they can try to get out
of the area of effect before they suffer damage.</p>

<h2 id="beholder-eye-of-shadow">Beholder Eye of Shadow</h2>

<p>In past articles we already established that beholders mutate when they cross
over from the Far Realm, taking characteristics that match their new
environment. Eyes of Shadow are beholders that hung out in the Shadowfell too
long, acquiring powers compatible with that bleak place.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>We’re back in familiar territory here: this beholder is Large and a Level 12
Elite Lurker with 194 HP. It has the same speed and senses as the spawn above,
deals extra damage when it has combat advantage, and heals 20 HP at the end of a
turn if it has remained invisible since the start of that turn.</p>

<p>It capitalizes on those passive traits through a couple of auxiliary abilities:
its <strong>Central Eye</strong> (minor action 1/round) projects a fear attack that targets
Will and makes the target grant combat advantage; and it can <strong>Vanish Into
Shadow</strong> (recharge 5+) as a move action, teleporting up to 20 squares and
becoming invisible until it attacks or until the end of its next turn.</p>

<p>As for its actual attacks, there’s the usual <strong>bite</strong> and a set of 3 <strong>eye
rays</strong>. These are ranged attacks but don’t provoke opportunity attacks. The
beholder can fire two of them in the same action but must aim each at a
different target. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a <strong>Blinding Ray</strong> (vs. Reflex) that deals radiant damage and blinds for a
turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a <strong>Thundering Ray</strong> (vs. Fortitude) which deals heavy thunder damage and
deafens for a turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a <strong>Shadowbond Ray</strong> (vs. Will) that deals necrotic damage and immobilizes
(save ends). While this condition lasts, the beholder and any shadow creatures
in play have concealment while within 5 squares of the target.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This beholder wants to attack from ambush and use its central eye and blinding
ray to make the PCs grant it combat advantage from a distance. Then it’s going
to hit them with thundering rays and bites while enjoying the extra
damage. Shadowbond is for melee defenders, and Vanish Into Shadow is a good
escape hatch. The teleport range on that is so large it could allow the beholder
to escape combat entirely, though an overconfident or angry individual might
still return to the fight as soon as it finishes healing those 20 HP.</p>

<p>Its ability to target any defense makes it quite versatile, even if it only has
three rays.</p>

<h2 id="ghost-beholder">Ghost Beholder</h2>

<p>While the Eye of Shadow is merely goth, this one is actually undead. Beholders
are stubborn and hateful creatures at the best of times, so it’s natural that
some of them will linger on as ghosts after they die or are killed. This usually
suits them just fine, but it also makes the more cautious since they know they
won’t get a third chance at existence.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-2">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Ghost beholders are Large Level 18 Elite Controllers with 254 HP. It combines
common beholder traits (as seen on the two previous monsters) with undead
ones. It’s immune to disease and poison, and Vulnerable 10 to radiant damage. As
a ghost, it’s insubstantial and has phasing.</p>

<p>Its <strong>bite</strong> is a ghostly attack that targets Reflex and does necrotic
damage. Its <strong>Central Eye</strong> has a minor-action poltergeist effect that targets
Will, slides the target 5 squares, and gives if 5 vulnerability to necrotic and
psychic damage for a turn. All of its eye rays deal one of these damage types.</p>

<p>The ghost beholder has three <strong>eye rays</strong> to choose from. It can only fire one
on its own turn, but it also has the <strong>Eyes of the Beholder</strong> trait that gives
it a free random ray attack against enemies that start their turn within 5
squares of it.</p>

<p>The rays are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Chill of the Grave</strong> (vs. Fortitude) does cold and necrotic damage, and
slows (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ghostly Possession</strong> (vs. Will) inflicts 15 ongoing psychic damage (save
ends)e. The first failed save also dazes the target; the second one completes
the possession. Possessed targets are dominated, and the beholder disappears
from play until the effect ends. This happens on a sucessful save, or the
beholder can end it voluntarily.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Killing Thought</strong> (vs. Will) does psychic damage and forces the target to
make a melee basic attack against themselves! Targets who are not holding a
weapon will drop what they’re holding, draw a weapon, and make that attack
anyway, all as part of the same free action. Creepy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ghost beholders are fond of phasing into the floor or walls to protect
themselves from attack, emerging from unexpected angles to shoot against the
characters. Fighting them without access to force and/or radiant damage is an
exercise in suffering.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>More Beholders! Even though the Eye of Shadow follows the same naming convention
as the Eyes of Flame and Frost, I think it has a better stat block. It does a
variety of unexpected damage types and can target any defense!</p>

<p>The Ghost Beholder also has interesting abilities, but its defenses make it a
nightmare to fight for an unprepared party. Even well-prepared undead hunters
might boggle a bit when they find one of those instead of more standard monster
like a vampire or banshee.</p>

<p>As for the spawn, I’d probably reskin them into something else. The idea of
mobile flying artillery minions is sound, but the thought of fighting beholder
“children” is a bit disturbing and I’m partial to the idea that beholders spawn
as fully-grown nightmares given form.</p>
