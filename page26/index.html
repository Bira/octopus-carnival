<p>The North has always had a reputation as a hotbed for cultist activity,
especially in these dark times, but this reputation is more than a bit
exaggerated. In truth, most of those cults are groups of young nobles from minor
families who get together to appear edgy, intimidate rivals, and have really
wild parties. They start their meetings with some mock evil ceremonies for the
lulz, then proceed to drink themselves into a stupor and leave a mess for their
servants to clean.</p>

<p>Choosing this theme means you were one of these “cultists” until
recently. Though you come from a noble lineage, your family was never wealthy
or very influential. You saw the cult as an opportunity to make useful
connections and advance your own wealth and power. Also, the parties were really
fun.</p>

<p>One day, you were late for a meeting. And when you arrived you found all of your
cult buddies dead, the room painted with their guts. In the center of the
carnage, the brazier you used for your pretend “diabolic rituals” burned with an
intensely hot flame that drew you in as if you were a moth. It lashed out and
etched a brand on your chest, and the pain caused you to pass out.</p>

<p>You woke up at home, but your hope that this had been just a nightmare faded
when you noticed that the brand was still there. You somehow recognize it as a
mark of Asmodeus. You fled your native Waterdeep in a confused panic, heading to
a backwater where no one knew you: the ruined city of Neverwinter. You found
allies and protection in the other PCs, though you are reluctant to share your
dark secret with them, and haunted by dreams where you betray them all.</p>

<p>This theme is the best choice for infernal warlocks who want to warlock twice as
hard, but there are no hard class prerequisites. There are no racial
prerequisites either, though since the PC is also from a minor Waterdeep noble
family they are likely to be a human, half-elf, elf, dwarf, or
eladrin. Tieflings with devil ancestors are also an interesting possibility
(guess FR tieflings are more similar to old-school ones).</p>

<p>The theme skills are Bluff and Religion.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, these features let infernal warlocks go at it twice as hard,
and they also lend an infernal “flair” to non-warlocks.</p>

<p>At level 1, the devil’s mark allows you to use the <strong>Hellfire and Brimstone</strong>
encounter power. This uses up a minor action and creates a zone in a Close Burst
2 around you. Creatures in the zone when it’s created take 5 fire damage (7 at
level 11, 10 at 21). Anyone inside afterwards takes a -2 penalty to all attack
rolls and defenses. The zone lasts for a turn.</p>

<p>The damage from Hellfire and Brimstone feels a bit low, but it’s automatic. And
the attack/defense penalty is useful for everyone at all levels.</p>

<p>At level 5, you gain a +4 to Diplomacy to interact with devils, and people or
creatures devoted to them (like diabolists or duergar). The brand exerts a pull
on them and draws them to you, whether you want to or not.</p>

<p>At level 10, you gain 10 Fire Resistance. If you already have fire resistance
from other sources (such as being a tiefling) it increases by 5 instead.</p>

<h2 id="optional-powers">Optional Powers</h2>

<p>The fiction here is that you trade a bit of your soul to learn these powers (or
to <em>use</em> the level 10 one), but that doesn’t have any more mechanical impact
than other infernal warlock powers. All of them also grant you additional
benefits if you’re an infernal pact warlock.</p>

<p><strong>Traitor’s Brand</strong> is a Level 2 daily power that can be used as a reaction when
an enemy within 5 squares hits you. You cause all creatures adjacent to that
enemy to take 1d6 fire damage. Add your Int modifier to this roll if you have
the Infernal Pact feature.</p>

<p>Int isn’t usually a high attribute for infernal warlocks, so the bonus is likely
to be low. But hey, it’s automatic damage, so every point helps.</p>

<p><strong>Shielding Hellfire</strong> is a Level 6 daily power that uses a minor action. It’s a
stance that envelops you in dark infernal flames. This gives you a +4 power
bonus to Stealth and Resist 5 Fire. If you already have fire resistance, it
increases that by 5 instead.</p>

<p>If you have an Infernal Pact, whenever your Warlock’s Curse is triggered the
stance also gives you a +4 power bonus on damage rolls from fire attacks until
the end of your next turn.</p>

<p><strong>Pit Fiend Harbinger</strong> is a level 10 daily power that uses a minor action, and
represents you fully embracing the power of your brand. In other words, you turn
into Devilman: your skin hardens into blackened scales and you grow wings and
horns. This gives you a +2 power bonus to AC, a fly speed equal to your ground
speed, and fire resistance equal to 5 + (your level). As usual, if you already
have fire resistance it gets increased by 5 instead.</p>

<p>The downside of the transformation is that you can’t spend healing surges and
you must make an attack on your turn each round or take damage equal to your
level at the end of the turn. This damage cannot be prevented or reduced in any
way. Warlocks already want to be attacking every turn anyway, but this could be
a problem if the last enemy falls before they can attack that turn, or if an
enemy prevents them from attacking somehow.</p>

<p>All of this lasts for a turn but can be sustained with more minor actions. If
you have an Infernal Pact, you gain 10 temporary HP every time you sustain the
power, which neatly remedies or mitigates both downsides of this power.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>This feels like an ironic take on the “edgy but not evil” trope, since a PC with
this theme <em>thought</em> they were that but then it turned out their pretend cult
drew the attention of actual cosmic evil.</p>

<p>You can still be an involuntary wielder of infernal magics if you stick with
just the features, but by default there’s nothing “involuntary” about the
optional utilities: they represent you willingly trading bits of your soul away
for more power. And both the level 6 and 10 powers seem like a very tempting
choice for an infernal pact warlock, be they full- or multi-class.</p>

<p>I don’t think multiple PCs with this theme in a party would work out. The
default inciting incident is very specific, which means all of the Pawn PCs
would have been present there. Them being in the same party set ups an
unsustainable tension between “no one must know!” and “this one
knows!”.</p>

<p>Also, the more Devil’s Pawns you have together, the higher the chance one of
them would succumb to the temptation of embracing these powers, dragging the
others down along with them. An all-Pawn party might start with the best of
intentions, but it would turn into an evil campaign quite soon. I’m not sure I’d
allow it in a group at all. If someone really wanted to play a warlock, I’d try
to convince them to take the Fey Pact instead.</p>

<p>There’s a bit of lore elsewhere that claims most PC infernal warlocks are
following an esoteric tradition based on <em>stealing</em> power from Hell, which
allows them to wield infernal powers without imperiling their soul and could
explain why devils generally dislike the character instead of being drawn to
them. Separated from its story bits, this theme could represent a warlock who
gained their powers through the more traditional path of making deals with
devils. They are more powerful than a theme-less warlock, but also more evil.</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned the Netherese several times already, and now it’s time to view
the theme most directly connected to them.</p>

<p>Okay, so we know that there was this ancient human empire named Netheril, that
it was ruled by archmages, and that it really liked building flying islands. We
also know that it fell overnight due to Shenanigans that caused its signature
magic to stop working and caused all of those islands to fall from the sky. And
we’ve also seen (spoilers!) that one of these islands fell on the Neverwinter
Wood. This island is named Xinlenal and it happens to be the first one ever
built.</p>

<p>Now, I think that either in the 4e FR book or somewhere near the end of third
edition, you had this metaplot event where the survivors of ancient Netheril
started coming back. Turns out another one of their island cities survived the
fall by crossing over into the Shadowfell, much like the eladrin did with the
Feywild. They spent all this time there, and were mutated by the plane’s
energies. Now they’re returning to the world bent on ruling it again, and are
engaged in sinister conspiracies the world over. These people consider
themselves heirs to Netheril and call themselves Shadovar. They’re fascists.</p>

<p>And sure enough, there are Shadovar in the Neverwinter Wood, trying to repair
Xinlenal.</p>

<p>If you’re a PC with this theme, you used to be one of them. Your early education
contained a lot of fascist drivel about how the Netherese were superior to all
other peoples of the world, and how they were going to reclaim their rightful
place at the top of the societal food chain once they returned. You were
assigned a post in the first scouting expeditions into the world, and fell in
love with all the warmth and sunlight you saw there. You also interacted with
plenty of supposedly “inferior” people that quickly dispelled the bullshit put
into your head by the Shadovar leadership.</p>

<p>You volunteered for a post at the location farthest from the center of Shadovar
power - Neverwinter. You managed to vanish shortly after arriving here, and now
live in the city, keeping your past a secret. But lately you’ve been seeing
signs and hearing rumors that tell you the Shadovar presence here is
increasing. The only thing that would get them this riled up is a repairable
flying city. If there really is one here (spoiler: there is) and they manage to
make it fly, then this could become a new major center for the Shadovar, and
you’d never escape them again. You need to stop them, if only to ensure you can
live a peaceful life here.</p>

<p>There are no class restrictions for this theme, but Scions of Shadow can only be
one of human, shadar-kai, or shade. Those last two represent whose bloodlines
were affected by the Shadowfell, or who were mutated directly. I think
Shadar-kai get a full playable treatment in the Gloomwrougth supplement, and
Shades appear in Heroes of Shadow. Even if you’re human, you’re still edgier
than usual.</p>

<p>The associated background skills are Arcana, Bluff, and Stealth.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The features here are all about your heritage brings you closer to the shadows,
even though you have chosen the light.</p>

<p>At level 1 you gain <strong>Eyes of Night</strong>. This daily power gives you Blindsight 10
for a turn when used.</p>

<p>At level 5, your healing surge value increases by 4 wherever you’re in dim light
or darkness.</p>

<p>At level 10, you gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff and Stealth checks.</p>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>More shadow magic!</p>

<p><strong>Flitting Shadow</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that can be used when you
reappear at the end of a teleport. The power makes you assume a shadow form for
a turn. This gives you Insubstantial, Phasing and Vulnerable 5 Radiant, and lets
you make checks to hide when you have partial cover or concealment from any
source, including from standing behind your allies. Shadar-kai get a teleport
encounter power, and classes like warlocks and swordmages can often teleport as
well. If you can’t teleport easily, this is worthless to you.</p>

<p><strong>Binding Shade</strong> is a level 6 encounter power that can be used after you hit
with an attack. After the attack is fully resolved, you gain partial concealment
and combat advantage against its target until the end of your next turn.</p>

<p><strong>Dancing Shadows</strong> is a level 10 daily power that lets you teleport 6 squares
when used. Until the end of the encounter, you can teleport 3 squares at will
with a move action. In all cases, you must appear in a square of dim light or
darkness. This also makes that level 2 power look a lot more attractive.</p>

<h2 id="impression">Impression</h2>

<p>Very edgy. The Level 5 feature and Level 10 power are awesome in a party that
doesn’t need bright light to operate.</p>

<p>The Shadovar/Netherese are a little less horrible than the Red Wizards, but only
a little. I wonder if you can capture their restored flying island and use it to
fight the finished Thayan fortress in a giant <del>robot</del> magical structure battle.</p>

<p>Thay is an island nation located somewhere outside of our regional map. It’s
ruled by wizards who like to wear red.</p>

<p>Now, if you’re only familiar with them from the Neverwinter Nights games, like I
am, you might have a somewhat ambiguous view of them. Sure, sometimes a Red
Wizard of Thay will be involved in evil schemes elsewhere in the world, but
#NotAllRedWizards are evil. There’s even a Lawful Neutral companion in NWN2: Mask
of the Betrayer who will praise the orderliness of her nation while helping you
save the world.</p>

<p>I’m here to tell you that this view is wrong. The Red Wizards of Thay are
basically Nazis. Their mechanical “thing” in 3e was that they overspecialized in
a single school of magic, but the edition change made the mask fall all the way
off and now nearly all of them pick Necromancy as their special school. So
they’re <em>necromantic</em> Nazis.</p>

<p>Thayan society values magic power above all else, so the Red Wizards are at the
top. The use of undead labor is widespread. Their rulers are a council of liches
led by one Szass Tam, one of those annoying epic villains the Forgotten Realms
are famous for. Most of the population thinks this state of things is
natural. Dissidents get zombified.</p>

<p>If you are a PC with the Renegade Red Wizard theme, you too grew up thinking all
of this was normal. You were pretty happy when your aptitude for magic was
discovered and you were admitted into one of the island’s prestigious Red Wizard
academies. You remained happy right up until your best friend made a tiny
mistake during a ritual, and your teacher was so enraged that he killed your
friend on the spot. Then he had the body brought in to be reanimated by your
class as a group project. You were completely horrified, but you looked around
you and saw that everyone else <em>still thought all of this was normal</em>.</p>

<p>You ran away the first chance you got, as fast as your feet could carry you, and
went as far as Neverwinter before you stopped and took stock of your
situation. You decided to stick around and help the reconstruction of the city.</p>

<p>And then you discovered the Thayans were <em>here</em>, doing something unspeakably
evil somewhere in the Neverwinter Wood. You’re done running. Time to do
something about these dang wizard Nazis.</p>

<p>This theme has no ancestry restriction, but its features only make sense for the
Essentials Wizard (also known as the Mage). The associated background skills are
Bluff, Heal, Religion, and Stealth. That seems like a lot, but it’s still
balanced because you still only get to pick one of them to boost or add to your
class list.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>This theme has no optional powers, but it makes up for that with extra
features. To understand how they work we must first know a bit about the
Essentials Wizard (known as the Mage from here on out).</p>

<p>Mages specialize in specific schools of magic as they level up. Heroes of
the Fallen Lands has three of them: Enchantment, Illusion and Evocation. Each
has an Apprentice, Expert, and Master feature, and a set of paragon-tier powers.</p>

<p>At levels 1 and 4 the mage chooses an Apprentice feature for two different
schools (one at each of those levels). At levels 5 and 8, they gain Expert
features for these same schools. At level 10, they gain the Master feature for a
single school and go on to pick paragon-tier powers for that same school as they
level up even further.</p>

<p>In olden times, Red Wizards were known for specializing in a single school to a
greater degree than most others. Nowadays, they always pick “necromancy”, but
the Renegade PC has used their basic teachings to pick something else. So one of
their magic schools is Enchantment, Illusion or Invocation like a normal mage,
but the other is replaced by the extra features of this theme. The other
features usually relate to your experience hiding from and fighting your former
compatriots.</p>

<p>Starting from level 1, every time you attack from hiding with an arcane power
and miss every target, you remain hidden. Enemies can still try to make
Perception checks to find you, but you’re no longer automatically revealed.</p>

<p>At level 4, you don’t get to make a second Apprentice choice. Instead, when one
of your spells causes a save-ends effect, the target has a -2 penalty on those
saves.</p>

<p>At level 5, you can switch one of your prepared spells at the end of a short
rest once per day, as long as its from your specialist school. Usually Mages can
switch spells only at the end of a long rest. Spell-switching is less of an
issue in 4e than it was earlier, in my experience, so this isn’t a very large
benefit.</p>

<p>At level 8, you don’t get your second Expert choice. Instead you gain a +2
bonus to Bluff and Intimidate. The bonus is untyped, which is the least they
could to do compensate for the lack of another Expert magic feature.</p>

<p>At level 10, you gain an extra +1 (untyped!) bonus to attack any Red Wizard or
undead creature that grants combat advantage to you. As a ranged controller, you
can’t get combat advantage quite as easily as a melee striker, but this is still
pretty nice. Several of your spells should inflict conditions that make enemies
grant CA.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Out of all these features, I think the level 4 one is the best. Since wizards
are controllers, a very large number of their powers are of the save-ends type,
so a -2 penalty to all enemy saves is huge. The attack bonus against all undead
is also pretty cool, but it comes in very late in the campaign.</p>

<p>If a non-Mage picked this theme, I’d rejigger is so they still get the Level 1
and 10 features as written, but get the printed Level 4 feature at level 5.</p>

<p>Now, about the story: As I mentioned previously, the Red Wizards are responsible
for the volcanic eruption that half-destroyed Neverwinter. Their original
intention was to <em>fully</em> destroy it and use the deaths to power the Super
Necromantic Fortress they were building in the Neverwinter Wood. A band of novel
protagonists foiled them 30 years ago, but now they have returned to the site of
the incomplete fortress to try and finish the process. This is what the Renegade
has found clues about.</p>

<p>Therefore, I would be inclined to include an NPC Renegade if the party has none,
just so they can point the PCs towards the Red Wizards. Punching them would as
satisfying as punching Hellknights and Nazis.</p>

<p>Delzoun was the ancient dwarven empire that flourished at around the same time
as the other ancient empires of the region. Being underground, it managed to
survive the fall of Netheril relatively unscathed and last a few more centuries.</p>

<p>They had several underground cities in the area, but their grand capital of
Gauntlgrym was the most majestic and famous. It started out as a mining
complex. Eventually its workers Delved Too Greedily and Too Deep, and found a
slumbering primordial: Maegera the Inferno.</p>

<p>Luck was on the dwarves’ side, and they managed to avoid waking Maegera up. Some
time later, Delzoun’s leadership would make a deal with the archmage who ruled
over the city of Illusk, founded by Netheril survivors. Combining their
technical and magical expertise, they built a geothermal power generator around
Maegera’s prison, using her as the heat source. This brought both civilizations
great prosperity, for a time.</p>

<p>Eventually, Illusk was razed and Gauntlgrym suffered the fate of all dwarven
fortresses, falling to an orcish invasion. Over the following years the orcs
would be displaced by humans, the humans by mind flayers, and then the city
would fall out of history and into myth. Today, Gauntlgrym is seen like a sort
of dwarven Atlantis - no dwarf alive knows where it was located, but many dream
of finding it and unearthing its riches.</p>

<p>A few years ago, though, an incredible event happened: a number of dwarves
throughout the world started receiving visitations from ghosts clad in the
ancient garb of Delzoun. The ghosts warned these distant descendants of theirs
that a great and terrible beast (spoiler: it’s Maegera) was about to awaken in
the site of ancient Gauntlgrym, and that this must not be allowed to pass. They
plead with these descendants to find the city and prevent the awakening. This
provoked a sort of “gold rush” to find the city, which died down after a few
more years of no one finding it.</p>

<p>The PC is one of the dwarves visited by the ghost of their ancestor, one who
hasn’t given up the search. They dream of finding their city, reclaiming their
ancient birthright, and elevating their family name to its rightful place among
their people’s legends. Oh, and of preventing the world-ending disaster that
would happen if this mysterious beast awakens. Strike the Earth!</p>

<p>There are no class prerequisites here, but as a true heir of Delzoun the PC must
be a dwarf. The associated background skills are Dungeoneering and History.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>These generally make you dwarfier than your typical dwarf.</p>

<p>Your starting feature makes you even more resistant to poison, granting you (5 +
half level) poison resistance.</p>

<p>At level 5, you gain an extra healing surge.</p>

<p>At level 10, you gain a +4 bonus to Diplomacy, Bluff and Intimidate when
interacting with other dwarves.</p>

<h2 id="optional-powers">Optional Powers</h2>

<p>These continue the theme of the features, making you tougher or more skilled in
dwarven lore.</p>

<p><strong>Scholar of Ancient Ways</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that lets you roll a
History check in place of any other INT-based skill check, or a Dungeoneering
check in place of any other WIS-based skill check. Because all things are like
dwarf fortresses if you look at them the right way.</p>

<p><strong>Noble Indomitability</strong> is a level 6 encounter power that works as an
interrupt. When you’re subject to forced movement, you can use it to spend a
healing surge and completely negate that movement.</p>

<p><strong>Body Over Mind</strong> is a level 10 encounter power that can be used when you fail
a saving throw. It lets you spend a healing surge to succeed at that throw
instead.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>These powers and features are excellent for all types of defenders, but they can
help a dwarf of any class become even more survivable. I know this is one of the
themes that locks you into a single ancestry, but it would be quite funny to
have a non-dwarf PC who is a true heir because they were adopted into a dwarven
family that can trace their line to Delzoun. If I was trying to make Carrot
Ironfoundersson as a 4e PC, I’d give him this theme.</p>

<p>Story-wise, this is probably the best way to involve your party in the search
for Gauntlgrym. It’s easy to justify multiple PCs having it, and you could build
a campaign around an all-Heir party.</p>

<p>This is the other half of the barbarian plotline!</p>

<p>The Gray Wolf are another Uthgardt tribe. They share a lot of the same base
culture, but also have several important differences. Namely, they’re
werewolves! The condition has been with them since they were Netherese refugees,
and by now it’s quite well-integrated into their culture. Until very recently,
they behaved like your typical Uthgardt tribe: violent, yes, but turning that
capacity for violence only towards those who invaded their territory.</p>

<p>This changed with the latest generation of leaders, which have been taking the
tribe in a more aggressive direction. They’ve become raiders, killing for
material gain and sometimes even for sport. This got worse when a bunch of
mysterious shadow-people approached those leaders and filled their heads with
dreams of glory and of becoming part of a reborn ancient empire. The Grey Wolf
have stopped fighting for themselves and have begun fighting for lost
Netheril. They’ve kind of become a neo-fascist gang.</p>

<p>A PC with this theme is a member of the Grey Wolves who took a stand against
this early in the process, and was exiled. Rumors have reached them that the
leaders of the Grey Wolves have switched to executing dissidents, and this has
driven the PC to act. Their goal is now to drive the shadows of Netheril from
the region and cleanse the tribe of their influence, getting them back on the
right track. They see the other PCs as a “temporary pack” that will help them
achieve this goal. Lone wolves are a myth, after all.</p>

<p>The Pack Outcast can belong to any class. The Gray Wolves also dislike arcane
magic, but there was no one around to prevent the outcast from learning it if
they so choose. Still, melee weapon users are going to benefit much more from
it.</p>

<p>Most Grey Wolves are either humans or shifters.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>You’re a werewolf!</p>

<p>At level 1, you gain <strong>Body of the Wolf</strong>. This is an at-will power that lets
you turn into a wolf (or back) with a minor action. When you transform, you can
also shift 1 square. The character retains their stats, and gains a +1 bonus to
Speed. All equipment melds into their form and provides its passive benefits
(unless it’s a shield). The character can’t use item powers or access
containers, but gains a wolf bite attack and becomes proficient with it. This
counts as a melee weapon with a +3 proficiency bonus, 1d8 base damage, and the
same magical enhancement as the character’s primary weapon.</p>

<p>This bite is <em>much</em> better than the one the Dead Rat Deserter gets at level 10!
Its main advantage is counting as a magical melee weapon instead of being a
specific power. This lets the PC use any of their weapon powers while in wolf
form, meaning anyone that relies on this type of power benefits from it. This
means all melee martials both from the PHBs and from Essentials material, as
well as characters like wardens, barbarians, paladins, and even the Warpriest
(Essentials cleric).</p>

<p>The bite is still useless for characters who rely on implements, and the book
doesn’t say anything specific about whether implements work while melded to the
animal form. A generous GM might interpret “You continue to gain the benefits of
the equipment you wear” to say that they do work, giving you a spellcasting
wolf.</p>

<p>Starting at level 5, enemies adjacent to you grant combat advantage to you and
to <em>all</em> allies who are also adjacent to those enemies. You don’t need to be in
a flanking position, any adjacent space will do. Also, you get CA even if you’re
the only PC adjacent to the enemy. This is super useful for melee combatants.</p>

<p>At level 10, you gain a +2 power bonus to Athletics and Intimidate, which is
kinda underwhelming after the two other skills but can still be useful.</p>

<h2 id="optional-powers">Optional Powers</h2>

<p>You can get even more werewolf-y!</p>

<p><strong>Bite of the Wolf</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that can be used when you hit
an enemy that grants combat advantage to you with a melee attack. This knocks
the enemy prone. Despite the name, you don’t need to be in wolf form to use
it. And remember that after level 5 every adjacent enemy will grant you CA.</p>

<p><strong>Blood of the Wolf</strong> is a level 6 daily power that can be activated with a
minor action and gives you regeneration equal to (1 + CON Mod) while you’re
bloodied. Like a werewolf’s regeneration, it shuts down for a turn if you’re
damaged by silver.</p>

<p><strong>Soul of the Wolf</strong> is a level 10 daily power that lets you assume a hybrid
form. You retain all of your equipment, armor and weapons, and can use them
normally. You also gain the same bite attack as in the level 1 power, temporary
HP equal to (10 + CON Mod), and a +2 power bonus to Speed, Fortitude, Athletics,
Intimidate, and damage!</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>If there’s a Dead Rat Deserter in the party, they’re going to spend most of
their time looking with envy at the Pack Outcast. This is a theme that greatly
boosts melee weapon users and has a spectacular level 10 power. Even if such a
character already has something equivalent to one of its features and powers,
they’re unlikely to have all of them, so there’s something here for
everyone. Plus, you get to say you’re a werewolf!</p>

<p>The Pack Outcast and the Uthgardt Barbarian are going to get along like a house
on fire, and having both in the same party will let you “speedrun” the first
couple of milestones of the barbarian investigation plotline. And just like that
other theme, this one can also be used for multiple PCs without any convoluted
explanations. An all-Pack Outcast game is a Werewolf: The Forsaken campaign
using 4e rules.</p>
