<p>This is the fourth post of a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to
<strong>GURPS</strong>. Previous posts can be found below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/07/human-enemies.html">Humans</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/14/goblins.html">Goblins</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/17/wolves.html">Wolves</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Saurians are the least populous of the three sapient species inhabiting the
Gransys peninsula. They are less technically sophisticated than humans but
require little in the way of tools due to their great strength and
hardiness. And while they’re not nearly as malicious as goblins, they’re
fiercely territorial and have no qualms about eating any trespassers.</p>

<p>A Saurian’s body is densely muscled and covered in scales similar to a
crocodile’s in texture. Their heads resemble those of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogona">bearded dragons</a>, and
their mouths are filled with sharp teeth. A Saurian is able to walk upright not
just because of its roughly humanoid limbs, but because of its thick tail that
acts as a counterweight and shifts its center of mass backwards. The final
result makes even a burly human warrior look rather puny.</p>

<p>Saurians live in small bands humans call “basks” for their tendency to be found
basking in the sun. They reproduce by laying large eggs with soft, slimy
shells that require constaint moisture, which means basks often claim territory
near large bodies of water.</p>

<p>Saurians fight using crude spears and polearms sized for their large
frames. These and the occasional rawhide satchel are the most sophisticated
tools any human has seen them use. Those experienced in fighting them know to
sever the tail: it can be targeted from the side or behind at a -2 penalty. Like
the tail of certain mundane lizards, it comes off easily: injury over HP/2 is
enough to sever it, which means the Saurian is unable to stand upright. This
doesn’t reduce its movement, but it <em>does</em> mean it can only use its natural
weapons to fight.</p>

<p>Saurians in this state will usually try to flee the battle. The tail grows back
in time even if severed!</p>

<p>Below are descriptions of all species of saurian found in the original game and
its expansion. They are meant to be worthy challenges to 250-point delvers,
which makes them quite scary for less powerful characters.</p>

<h2 id="common-saurian">Common Saurian</h2>

<p>The most commonly found variety of Saurian is a dark brownish green in color,
and conforms exactly to the general description above. They are cold-blooded,
and thus tend to keep to Gransys’ warmer southern reaches.</p>

<p>In the original game, there was a sizable group of them living in a flooded
seaside cave underneath Cassardis, complete with a large amount of eggs.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 15; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>Parry</strong> 11U (dueling glaive); <strong>DR</strong> 4 (Tough Skin);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 15; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)</strong>: 1d+4 imp or 2d+4 cut, Reach 1,2*.</li>
  <li><strong>Claw or Bite (14)</strong>: 1d cut. The bite benefits from <em>Born Biter</em> (<strong>DF 3</strong>,
p. 15).</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Swipe (12)</strong>: 1d+1 cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); DR 4 (Tough Skin); Peripheral Vision;
Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp); Terrain Adaptation (Swamp);
Bestial; Cold-Blooded 2; Social Stigma (Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.</p>

<h2 id="sulfur-saurian">Sulfur Saurian</h2>

<p>This species of Saurian is so named for the color of their scales, which are
black with bright yellow streaks. They are a little more tolerant of the cold
than Common Saurians, and thus live further north. They share the same general
traits described above, and possess two other remarkable abilities: they can
shift the color of their scales to match their surroundings, and they can spit
paralytic venom!</p>

<p>Basks of Sulfur Saurians are common on the margins of the river crossing the
Cursewood in central Gransys and on the warm waters of Lake Hardship, being one
of the reasons for the lake’s name.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 17; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>Parry</strong> 11U (dueling glaive); <strong>DR</strong> 4 (Tough Skin);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 17; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)</strong>: 1d+5 imp or 2d+5 cut, Reach
1,2*. Often laced with the poison described below.</li>
  <li><strong>Claw or Bite (14)</strong>: 1d+1 cut. The bite benefits from <em>Born Biter</em> (<strong>DF
3</strong>, p. 15) and from the poison described below.</li>
  <li><strong>Poison Spit (12)</strong>: HT to resist; failure entails a non-cumulative -3 to DX
and IQ for 1 hour. Acc 3, Range 10.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Swipe (12)</strong>: 1d+2 cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); Chameleon 4; DR 4 (Tough Skin);
Peripheral Vision; Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp); Terrain
Adaptation (Swamp); Bestial; Cold-Blooded 1; Social Stigma (Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.</p>

<h2 id="geo-saurian">Geo Saurian</h2>

<p>This species has even stronger than a normal saurian, and has more clearly
supernatural traits. Their scales are black with small red streaks, and have a
metallic cast to them. Like sulfur saurians, they can change their coloration to
match the environment and have dangerous spit. Unlike sulfur saurians, their
sticky spit is <em>flaming</em>, not poisonous.</p>

<p>Geo Saurians can only be found on volcanic mountains or near active geothermal
vents. The most well-known concentration of these features is the Tainted
Mountain, which lies in the monster-infested range west of Gransys’s
borders. That’s not to say they couldn’t be found within some deep dungeon that
also had these features, along with other fire-themed beasts!</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 20; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 10; <strong>Parry</strong> 12U (dueling glaive); <strong>DR</strong> 7 (Tough Skin);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 20; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)</strong>: 2d+3 imp or 3d+5 cut, Reach
1,2*.</li>
  <li><strong>Claw or Bite (14)</strong>: 2d-2 cut with linked 1d burning. The bite benefits from
<em>Born Biter</em> (<strong>DF 3</strong>, p. 15).</li>
  <li><strong>Flaming Spit (12)</strong>: 1d burning. Acc 3, Range 10.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Swipe (12)</strong>: 2d cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); Combat Reflexes; Chameleon 4; DR 7 (Tough
Skin); Peripheral Vision; Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp);
Terrain Adaptation (Swamp); Bestial; Cold-Blooded 2; Social Stigma (Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.</p>

<h2 id="saurian-variants">Saurian Variants</h2>

<p>In all cases, the stat blocks above are for <em>average</em> saurians of each
type. The GM is free to increase their skills and attributes to produce
exceptional individuals without any additional justification! A few possible
variants found in the game merit special mention.</p>

<h3 id="giant-saurians">Giant Saurians</h3>

<p>Some saurians reach absurd sizes! Maybe they just never stop growing, or maybe
these have been contaminated by ambient magical energies. Take a normal saurian
and increase its SM to +2; multiply ST by 1.5. Their even bigger weapons add +1
to damage on top of the ST increase. Truly colossal specimens at SM+3, ST x2 and
+2 weapon damage might exist if the GM is feeling particularly sadistic.</p>

<h3 id="pyre-saurians">Pyre Saurians</h3>

<p>Despite their shape, they are not actual saurians, but lizard-shaped elemental
beings of pure fire and magma. Start with the stats for a geo saurian and change
its class to Elemental. Add Injury Tolerance (Homogenous), +2d to the burning
damage from the bite and spit, and a 1d burning emanation in a 2 meter
radius. Fortunately, they use no weapons and always rely on their natural
claws, bite and tail.</p>

<h3 id="saurian-sages">Saurian Sages</h3>

<p>Despite their bestial nature, Saurians do have a mystical tradition centered
around mastering their vulnerability to cold. Those rare individuals who
complete a pilgrimage to the roots of the world are able to master cold itself!
To make a Saurian Sage, start with a normal saurian and remove
Cold-Blooded. Raise IQ to at least 12, and add three or more levels of Water
College Magery or Elemental Empowerment related to water. Give them any
appropriate ice-themed spells or elementalist powers you wish. If starting from
a geo saurian, their burning spit becomes freezing instead: it still does
burning damage, but it’s no longer incendiary.</p>

<h3 id="variant-stacking">Variant Stacking</h3>

<p>“Pyre Saurian” and “Saurian Sage” are incompatible with each other. You won’t
even find individuals of both types working together! However, both variants
<em>are</em> compatible with the “Giant” upgrade, and combining them can give you
something not entirely unlike a dragon.</p>

            <p>Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder’s Iconic Characters to
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>! This is the ninth post in the series. Previous

<p>Today’s template is the Swashbuckler, which means today’s character is
Jirelle. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Jirelle.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2014 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Even if you’re familiar with Pathfinder’s Iconics, Jirelle might be somewhat new
to you. This is because the class she represents, the Swashbuckler, is not from
the core rules but from the “Advanced Class Guide” supplement. You can find her
bio <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg5a?Meet-the-Iconics-Jirelle">here</a>, and the only place where I could find her stats is inside <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9a64">this
free package of premade iconic characters</a> that contains all of them.</p>

<p>From these, we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Jirelle is a half-elf born in the Shackles, a pirate-infested archipelago. She
sunk her evil pirate’s mother ship to avoid becoming a demonic sacrifice, but
the ship and its whole crew later returned as undead. Her main long-term goal
is returning them to the depths.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her fighting style is acrobatic and daring, relying a lot on precision and
fencing skill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wields a rapier as her main weapon, and despite the illustration showing
one of every traditional off-hand fencing weapon on her person, the character
sheet indicates the buckler is her favorite.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It turns out we have quite a bit more options when picking a template for
Jirelle than we did back when I first started writing this series! The recently
released <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Denizens: Swashbucklers</strong> has <em>five</em>
different swashbuckler templates, each one with a slightly different focus! Now,
Jirelle’s piratical background might point to the Buccaneer, but her Pathfinder
stats are all about the flashy fencing with only a slight nod towards seafaring
skills. So it turns out that the default Swashbuckler template really is the
best choice here. We just have to make sure she knows how to sail.</p>

<p>I’m pretty satisfied with the result! <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> Jirelle has skill 20
with her rapier and skill 18 with her buckler, which enables some pretty cool
tricks. She also knows her way around a ship, and her Charisma helps boost her
social skills and Rapier Wit ability. Making her a better leader of men would be
a good use of earned character points, especially in parties that lack a more
dedicated social character. And of course, points spent on Rapier will never go
to waste!</p>

<p>Speaking of “points spent on Rapier”, this version of Jirelle spends one
character point on extra starting cash so she can afford the Edged Rapier.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy</strong>. Please go <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/06/enemies-overview.html">here</a> for links to all other posts in the

<p>Not even <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/14/goblins.html">goblins</a> are as annoying as the wolves of Gransys. The original
game’s suicidally aggressive monster AI combined with the move set of the “wolf”
monster family ensures that even basic wolves remain a nuisance long after
they’ve stopped being a threat. It doesn’t help that your pawns will helpfully
expound on anti-wolf tactics for even the easiest such encounter. Hopefully the
tabletop version will be a little better in that regard. This article covers all
sorts of canine enemies, but we start with the most basic of them all:</p>

<h2 id="wolves">Wolves</h2>

<p>The southern forests and mountain passes of Gransys are home to packs of large,
brownish wolves. Most of the time, they stay away from civilization and restrict
their hunting to other wild animals further down the food chain. A wolf pack
will only target livestock if no wild prey is available, and will only attack
people if they are utterly desperate. Unfortunately, both situations have become
more common ever since increased bandit and goblin presence in Southern Gransys
made game scarcer.</p>

<p>Use the Wolf stats from p. <strong>B458</strong> for average wolves, and the more powerful
Hound and Timber Wolf stats from <strong>DF 5</strong> p. 9 for large specimens (of which
there is at least one per pack encountered).</p>

<h2 id="dire-wolves">Dire Wolves</h2>

<p>The colder northern reaches of Gransys are home to a larger and more vicious
white-furred species of wolf. The <em>smallest</em> of them use the Hound template from
<strong>DF 5</strong>, and they frequently get up to the size shown in <strong>DF 2</strong>, p. 22. While
they mostly stick to wild prey deep in the woods, they are much more confident
about targetting livestock and humans who wander into their territory.</p>

<h2 id="wargs">Wargs</h2>

<p>These horrible creatures look like standard wolves from a distance, but closer
inspection will reveal their true natures. Wargs are <em>undead</em> wolves, with
rotted-through hides and infected bites. Forget any semblance of realistic
behavior here - they hang out in tombs and dungeons and prefer their meals to be
sapient and alive at the time of eating.</p>

<p>To make a warg, take a normal or dire wolf and change its class to
Undead. Change DR to 4, add Injury Tolerance (Unliving), and add a 1d toxic
follow-up to their bite, resisted with HT-2.</p>

<h2 id="hell-hounds">Hell Hounds</h2>

<p><em>These</em> horrors are stirred up by the coming of the Dragon, and enter the world
through the same portal as it. They are even more untroubled my mundane
physiology than wargs: their blood boils, and they breathe fire at will.</p>

<p>To make a hell hound, take a normal or dire wolf and change its class to
Demon. Change DR to 5 (15 vs. Fire), add Injury Tolerance (Homogenous), and a
2d Burning Innate Attack with the Cone enhancement. The cone is three yards wide
at its widest. They can use this attack <em>at will</em>, and are happy to do so since
they don’t need to worry about friendly fire!</p>

<h2 id="wolves-hunt-in-packs">Wolves Hunt in Packs!</h2>

<p>All enemies described in this article fight in a similar way. The pack attempts
to surround the target, and some of the wolves will distract it with growls and
feints so that others can bite from unexpected angles. They usually know their
territory fairly well, and might try to herd a particularly mobile victim to a
spot they can’t run away from.</p>

<p>All “wolf”-like enemies should have the Wrestling skill even if that’s not
listed in their original stats, at a level equal to the highest of their
Brawling or DX. They like to use that to grab their targets with a bite and pull
them to the ground, enabling the rest of the pack to move in and gang up on the
victim.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy</strong>. Please go <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/06/enemies-overview.html">here</a> for links to all other posts in the
series.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/07/human-enemies.html">last post</a> we saw that Gransys has a serious bandit problem, but it’s
not nearly as bad as its <em>goblin</em> problem. A lone goblin is not much of a threat
to anyone trained in fighting, but they’re never alone! The danger posed by a
force of goblins grows out of proportion to their individual might, as they
quickly organize themselves under the leadership of “goblin kings”.</p>

<p>Despite this, they don’t have anything resembling a complex culture: there’s no
goblin language, and “goblin art” is almost an oxymoron. Goblins live in
mountain caves and obtain most of their complex tools by stealing them from
humans. A goblin king is simply a goblin who’s smarter or stronger than usual
and who manages to browbeat a group of his fellows into obeying. Capable enough
monarchs soon find themselves in command of a small army, and might manage to
even enslave larger monsters such as cyclopes. Much of the Duke’s strategy with
those centrally-controlled border fortresses aims to protect Gransys from goblin
raids originating in the mountain chains west of the duchy.</p>

<p>Smaller groups are everywhere within Gransys, operating like more chaotic
bandits. Despite their common interests, goblins and human bandits don’t get
along well - goblins are just as happy to attack <em>them</em> as they are to attack
civilians.</p>

<h2 id="goblin">Goblin</h2>

<p>Your average goblin is a small humanoid with reddish skin, pointy ears and
teeth, and cat-like eyes. They’re rarely more than about five feet tall, and
their intellect is nothing to write home about. They use improvised or scavenged
weapons.</p>

<h3 id="racial-template--51-points">Racial Template (-51 points)</h3>

<p><strong>Attribute Modifiers</strong>: IQ-2 {-40}; HT+1 {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Characteristic Modifiers</strong>: SM -1; Basic Move -1 {-5}</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Infravision {10}; Resistant to Metabolic Hazards +3 {10};
Teeth (Sharp) {1}; Giant Weapons 1 {1}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Appearance Ugly {-8}; Bully (12) {-10}; Cowardice (12) {-10};
Laziness {-10};</p>

<h3 id="goblin-rabble">Goblin Rabble</h3>

<p>These are typical representatives of the goblin stereotype. They live in caves
or crude camps and love to rob and torment passing travelers. One of them is
still a credible threat to an unarmed civilian, and they always come in large
numbers.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 10; <strong>DX</strong> 11; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> -1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 8; <strong>Parry</strong> 9U (light mace); <strong>DR</strong> 0;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 10; <strong>Will</strong> 8; <strong>Per</strong> 8; <strong>FP</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 5.5; <strong>Move</strong> 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cheap Small Mace (12)</strong>: 1d+2 cr.</li>
  <li><strong>Punch (10)</strong>: 1d-3 cr.</li>
  <li><strong>Grapple (10)</strong>: Uses Wrestling.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: As per the Goblin racial template.</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Cheap small mace, rags.</p>

<h2 id="hobgoblin">Hobgoblin</h2>

<p>These are much bigger and stronger than normal goblins. It’s unknown whether
they are a separate species or not, but a group of them can often be found
bossing smaller goblins around. Hobgoblins are more sophisticated than their
smaller, lazier cousins: they can make their own equipment and are more skilled
and disciplined in combat. Despite this, individuals aren’t all that smarter
than normal goblins.</p>

<h3 id="racial-template--6-points">Racial Template (-6 points)</h3>

<p><strong>Attribute Modifiers</strong>: ST+2 {20}, IQ-2 {-40}; HT+1 {10}</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Characteristic Modifiers</strong>: Will+2 {10}; Per +2 {10}</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Infravision {10}; Resistant to Metabolic Hazards +3 {10}; Teeth
(Fangs) {2}</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Appearance Ugly {-8}; Bully (12) {-10}; Bloodlust (12) {-10};
Sadism {-10};</p>

<h3 id="hobgoblin-grunt">Hobgoblin Grunt</h3>

<p>The hobgoblin rank and file are more enthusiastic about fighting than common
goblins. They roam in small bands, sometimes with an accompanying gaggle of
goblins. They use swords, shields and mail armor of hobgoblin make. Their
overall behavior is more in line with that of human bandits than common goblins,
but they consider human bandits to be prey like any other human.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 14; <strong>DX</strong> 11; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 13</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> 0; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9 (10); <strong>Parry</strong> 10 (11) (sword); <strong>Block</strong> 10 (11); <strong>DR</strong>
4/2*.</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 14; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 13;</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 6.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cheap Thrusting Broadsword (14)</strong>: 2d+1 cut or 1d+2 imp.</li>
  <li><strong>Shield Bash (14)</strong>: 1d cr.</li>
  <li><strong>Grapple (14)</strong>: Uses Wrestling. Effective ST 16.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: As per Hobgoblin racial template.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Cheap thrusting broadsword, mail armor, small shield.</p>

<h2 id="variants">Variants</h2>

<p>Not all goblins are average! The sample enemies given above are the equivalent
of humans built with the 62-point templates in <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 15:
Henchmen</strong>. Exceptional individuals built with the Brute, Skirmisher or Killer
125-point templates and one of the racial templates above are relatively
common, and the variations below may also be found.</p>

<h3 id="goblin-king">Goblin King</h3>

<p>This is a remarkably intelligent member of the species, able to forge the usual
goblin rabble into a more efficient fighting force. Raise IQ by 2+, add one or
more levels of Born War Leader and the skills covered by that talent. The
smarter and more talented the king, the larger the force they can command!
Really strong kings might be built with the Knight template from <strong>DF 1</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="goblin-mage">Goblin Mage</h3>

<p>Some exceptional goblins delve into the arcane arts rather than contenting
themselves with brute force. Minor shamans with IQ 11, Magery 1 and around 10
spells are as likely to lead small goblin bands as a king. More powerful
examples exist as part of larger communities or deep in the mountains. Build
them with the Apprentice or Wizard templates.</p>

<h3 id="grimgoblins">Grimgoblins</h3>

<p>These terrible creatures hint at the true origin of goblins. They look like an
albino version of normal goblins or hobgoblins, but are much more dangerous than
either! Most people have never seen one, and think they are a myth. The coming
of the Dragon will make them see their error.</p>

<p>Build a normal goblin or hobgoblin first, using any of the templates and
variations above. Change Class to <em>Demon</em>. Raise ST by 5, DX and HT by 2, combat
skills by 2 or more. Change Resistant to Metabolic Hazards to Immunity to
Metabolic Hazards. Grim Kings and Mages are proportionally smarter and more
dangerous as well.</p>

<p>Now, this should really have been the <em>seventh</em> post in the series, as the
Martial Artist template comes before Scout. In any case, we’ll address it today,
which means our character is Sajan. Here he is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Sajan.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I think he looks kinda awesome. Anyway, his <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Sajan_Gadadvara">bio</a> and his <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/sajan.html">official stats</a>
give us the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>He was born in Vudra, his world’s India analogue, where he was a member of the
warrior caste along with his beloved twin sister Sajni. Even after they were
posted to separate barracks at the age of 12 they still met regularly to spar
and hang out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sajni was given away as part of a peace agreement, and Sajan ran after her. He
tracked her down to Absalom, his world’s “big cosmopolitan city”, and has been
looking for her since.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a monk he’s quite acrobatic and prefers to rely on his flurry of blows in
combat. He might also grapple or trip opponents with his hooked “temple
sword” if that’s more tactically advantageous.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest difficulty I see in building Sajan as a DF Martial Artist is that
his Pathfinder version uses unarmed strikes a lot more often than the sword, and
those are harder to make effective in GURPS. My version of him has a bigger
focus on the temple sword, which I statted up as a khopesh from <strong>Low-Tech</strong>. As
a Weapon Master, he can cause quite a bit of damage with swings, and he’s almost
as skilled with grapples and unarmed strikes. The gauntlets help him punch armed
and armored opponents without hurting his hands. Sajan’s special skills cover
many of the abilities d20 Monks have, as well. His very limited equipment
loadout means I didn’t need to spend any character points for extra starting
cash!</p>
