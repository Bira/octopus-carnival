<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Blizzard Dragons were created by Umboras, Lord of the Rimefire. The dragon
petitioners who approached this primordial were the coldest-hearted among their
number. Umboras took them to the coldest reaches of the Elemental Chaos and
entombed them there for a year and a day while he worked his magic on them. When
they emerged, they were blizzard dragons.</p>

<p>Umboras had a specific goal in mind when he did this. He had been an ally of the
winter goddess Khala, who shared with him the goal of freezing the world
solid. However, the Raven Queen had just usurped Khala and claimed the domain of
winter from her, so Umboras was out for revenge. He created blizzard dragons to
help transport his troops to the Raven Queen’s new home of Letherna.</p>

<p>The Queen, however, was smarter than him. She retreated to the labyrinthine
astral domain of Pandemonium, and used its twisty little passages (all alike) to
separate Umboras from his main forces and lock him in one of the domain’s empty
vaults. He’s still there!</p>

<p>The blizzard dragons scattered after their master was imprisoned. Some stayed in
Pandemonium, some returned to the Elemental Chaos, some even went to the coldest
places of the world. For obvious reasons, though, you’ll rarely find one of them
in the Shadowfell.</p>

<p>Blizzard dragons don’t usually have grand plans of their own, and are usually
content to freeze and sculpt their territories. However, they’re surprisingly
good team players and can often be found allied to other creatures of compatible
disposition, helping them achieve their goals. This varies from the usual frost
giants and ice archons to liches or winter fey, depending on the individual. And
they’re always down for breaking a primordial out of prison.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Blizzard dragons are Elemental Magical Beasts with the Cold and Dragon
keywords. They have Darkvision, Ice Walk, and a clumsy flight speed. All of
their attacks do cold damage, even the bites and claws.</p>

<h3 id="blizzard-dragon-wyrmling">Blizzard Dragon Wyrmling</h3>

<p>Wyrmlings are Medium, making them the smallest dragons I’ve seen in my Let’s
Read so far. They’re Level 2 Controllers with 38 HP. They have ground and air
speeds of 6.</p>

<p>Yeah, that’s right, wyrmlings are <em>regulars</em>. This means they’ll almost always
be found cooperating with a sizable group of other monsters. The most obvious
candidates are their clutch-siblings, but they’re smart enough to strike an
alliance with lots of other people.</p>

<p>They are surrounded by an aura (1) of <strong>Freezing Wind</strong>. Enemies that end their
turn inside are slid 1 square. When hit by a cold attack, the wyrmling reacts
with <strong>Sudden Flurry</strong>, immediately sliding all enemies inside its aura 1
square.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> immobilizes, and their <strong>claws</strong> slide the target 1 square on a
hit. While they’re bloodied, <strong>Wyrmling Fury</strong> allows them to spend an action to
attack with both.</p>

<h3 id="young-blizzard-dragon">Young Blizzard Dragon</h3>

<p>Young’uns grow to size Large, and become Level 7 Elite Controllers with 166
HP. Their speed increases to 8.</p>

<p>They have all of the wyrmling’s abilities with a few differences and
additions. The simplest one is that Wyrmling Flurry is replaced by a standard
Double Attack ability, and their claws slide 2 squares.</p>

<p>Unlike other dragons, blizzards don’t have a breath weapon. Instead, when
they’re hit by a melee attack, a high-pressure blast of frozen liquid bursts
forth from the wound. This is written as a reaction named <strong>Chill Rebuke</strong>, a
Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude. It deals cold damage and slows on a hit (save
ends).</p>

<p>This is also where the “living disaster” mechanic kicks in. Here it’s an ability
named <strong>Rising Winds</strong>. Once this is activated as a minor action, it causes the
size of the dragon’s Freezing Wind aura to grow to 3. At the start of the
dragon’s next turn, it automatically expands again, to 5. And at the start of
the following turn, the dragon makes a Close Burst 5 attack vs. Fortitude, with
a hit dealing cold damage, slowing, and blinding the targets. Once the attack is
resolved, the aura returns to is initial size of 1 and Rising Winds recharges.</p>

<h3 id="adultelder-blizzard-dragon">Adult/Elder Blizzard Dragon</h3>

<p>Adults and elders are identical to young’uns, with bigger numbers. Adults are
Level 12 Elite Controllers with 252 HP, and Elders are Level 17 with 338
HP.</p>

<p>Elders are Huge and can move at speed 10. They can slide enemies 3 squares with
their claws and 2 squares with their auras. Their Rising Winds attack restrains
instead of immobilizing.</p>

<h3 id="ancient-blizzard-dragon">Ancient Blizzard Dragon</h3>

<p>Ancients are Huge in size, and are Level 22 Elite Controllers with 422
HP. They’re almost idendical to elders, with bigger numbers. They also have a
new encounter power named <strong>Deep Freeze</strong> that works kinda like a breath weapon,
though I guess it’s more of a high-pressure blood ejection, since the dragon
must be bloodied to use it.</p>

<p>This ability attacks enemies in a Close Burst 5, targetting Fortitude. A hit
deals cold damage, immobilizes, and imposes a -5 penalty to Fortitude (save ends
both). A miss deals half damage and imposes the same penalty for a single
turn. All of the dragon’s non-basic attacks target Fortitude, so this penalty
makes it a lot more dangerous while it lasts.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Blizzard dragons feel like they slide into the exact same niche as white
dragons, with a similar cold theme and a similarly unpleasant
personality. Blizzards are smarter and not technically evil, but they still make
for terrible neighbors.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they <em>feel</em> like dragons and like cold themed creatures without
actually using any of the signature mechanics for either! This is a dragon that
does not have a breath attack or a fear aura, and a cold creature that is not
immune to cold. It’s fascinating!</p>

            <p>I’ve talked a lot about dragons, and why I like their 4e implementation, over
the course of these book readings. Sometimes it feels like no big D&amp;D bestiary
is complete without introducing a new dragon subtype.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual talked about the classic chromatics, which were then updated
on the Monster Vault. You can see what I wrote about them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual 2 talked about the equally classic metallics, and you can
read what I wrote about them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual 3 introduces the much less famous and much newer Catastrophic
Dragons. I believe they are new to 4e, though they might also have shown up in
some late supplement for a previous edition. You might already have noticed I’m
a bit lazy when it comes to researching monster publication histories.</p>

<p>What I’m sure about is that these are the first 4e dragons that have the
“correct” math from the start. They’re also notable for being generally <em>weaker</em>
than chromatics and metallics despite the impressive name. Your typical
catastrophic dragon is an Elite monster rather than a Solo.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As we saw in previous articles about dragons, when the god Io was split in two
during the Dawn War his followers also split along ideological lines based on
which of the two new deities they preferred: Tiamat the greedy or Bahamut the
just. I imagine the initial decision was easy for most of them.</p>

<p>For most, but not for all. Some of Io’s orphaned followers were gripped by fear
when they saw how easily their lord had been slain, and they decided that the
best way to survive would be to beseech the Primordials for protection and join
their side of the Dawn War. These turncoats were transformed by the “blessings”
of the Primordials into the first catastrophic dragons.</p>

<p>When the Primordials were defeated most surviving catastrophics scattered across
the multiverse and turned to their own selfish purposes. The typical
catastrophic in the present day is somewhat less formidable than a chromatic,
but more outwardly destructive. They tend to live in extremely hostile
environments that befit their individual natures, and from the point of view of
surrounding civilians their behavior looks a lot like that of a natural
disaster: they occasionally emerge to wreak havoc and destruction on people and
their environment, and then return to their lairs for an unknown amount of time.</p>

<p>Legends and myths dating back to the Dawn War tell of catastrophic dragons of
immense size and power, capable of sinking continents and destroying entire
astral domains. No one knows whether these stories are true, and even the gods
refuse to tell.</p>

<h2 id="the-dragons">The Dragons</h2>

<p>This entry is structured a lot like previous dragon entries, with each type of
dragon presented getting stat blocks for all of its age categories. That’s about
where it stops, though. Catastrophic dragons are more like personified natural
disasters than like the traditional dragons we saw in previous books.</p>

<p>The ones we see here are clumsy fliers, and even lack the traditional breath
weapon! Instead, they’re surrounded by an aura that’s like a miniature version
of the disaster they embody. During a fight, this aura grows in size as time
passes and then explodes in a, well, catastrophic manner before returning to its
initial size and beginning the cycle anew.</p>

<p>Despite having bodies largely made up of elemental matter, these dragons lack
any elemental resistances. Instead, damage of their associated type triggers a
reaction ability that punishes the attacker in some form. I would however say
that they are immune to <em>environmental</em> damage of their associated type even
though that’s not made explicit in their stat blocks, because it just wouldn’t
do for a blizzard dragon to die of frostbite.</p>

<p>The last major mechanical difference between these dragons and their
predecessors is that catastrophics are Elites instead of Solos. Whether this is
just bad luck or a punishment from the gods, it means that fights against them
will include a bigger supporting cast of other monsters.</p>

<p>There are more age categories here than in the previous books: Wyrmling, Young,
Adult, Elder and Ancient. Wyrmlings are Medium in size, and are regular monsters
instead of Elites. Young’uns and Adults are Large, and the last two are Huge. I
guess a wyrmling isn’t quite a “baby dragon”, but I’d still be a bit wary of
placing them as enemies, as I commented earlier.</p>

<p>Despite their thematic link to natural disasters and their destructive demeanor,
catastrophic dragons are typically Unaligned, which says interesting things
about their mindset.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>I don’t remember seeing these specific devils in earlier editions, but that
might just mean they were from a late 3e book.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>This is not the first silver-tongued manipulative devil we’ve seen, not by far,
but it seems to be the most specialized one. Vizier devils are rarely found in
the Nine Hells - they’re always out in the world serving and tempting ambitious
mortals.</p>

<p>Like all other MM3 devils, the lore text on this one is a bit obsessed with sin
and with the idea that sinners going to hell and becoming devils is a natural
occurrence, which isn’t really something that was present in earlier 4e monster
books. As we saw in previous readings, in 4e Hell is a cosmic aberration. Devils
don’t come from sinners, and they get their souls either by having mortals sign
contracts or through force. Those souls get used as currency, fuel, and magic
item ingredients, not to make new devils.</p>

<p>This makes these creatures members of Hell’s sales department, just like
imps. The main difference is that viziers are stronger, smarter, and bolder in
their suggestions. I imagine having a bound vizier devil instead of a mere bound
imp is a major status symbol among deluded diabolists.</p>

<p>If you’re into the sin thing (which was the standard in 3e and maybe earlier),
they you can go with the lore in this entry that says that vizier devils are
genuinely helpful at first but then begin to steer their “masters” down more
evil and sinful paths with the goal of making them go to Hell after they die.</p>

<p>If you prefer the standard 4e lore, then the main difference is that vizier
devils will try to get their masters to sign a soul contract either as a
pre-condition to their service, or as an “upsell” in exchange for greater power
or greater hellish support at some point after they begin their work as
advisors.</p>

<p>A 4e-style, contract-based vizier devil is ironically less treacherous than the
temptation-based 3e-style one. Their mortal bosses are likely to <em>already</em> be
evil in the first place, so they need little tempting. And after the contract is
signed there is even less need for deception, as the devil already got what it
wanted and only needs to fulfill its part of the bargain.</p>

<p>Vizier devils look like tieflings with slightly exaggerated fiendish features,
and that actually makes them good at blending in. In combat, they’re
spellcasters with a repertoire focusing on fire and charm magic. They always
have a contingency plan or two to escape if the fight goes against them, and
never fight to the death if they can help it.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Vizier devils are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils), and Level 7 Controllers
(leaders). They have Resist Fire 10, Darkvision, a ground speed of 6, and a
teleport speed of 4. That’s more or less the same set of traits as a legion
devil, so maybe they’re related.</p>

<p>They wield <strong>Scepters</strong> that work as implements and can be used to bash people
in melee. This does physical damage and slides the target 1 square on a
hit. Their basic ranged attack is a <strong>Helfire Bolt</strong> that does fire damage and
forces the target to grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>They can also use a <strong>Word of Command</strong> at will, which lets them choose a
creature within 2 squares, slide it 3 squares and have it make a free melee
basic attack against another creature of the devil’s choice. The text says “a
creature”, which means this can target either an ally or an enemy with this. And
the thing is an <em>effect</em>, not an <em>attack</em>, which means it works
automatically.</p>

<p>Word of Command does require a standard action, but it’s still a good choice if
the vizier is accompanied by big bruisers or if the party includes PCs with good
basic attacks. It’s even better if the party includes some of those Essentials
martial classes, since they’re all about having awesome melee basic attacks with
all sorts of special riders.</p>

<p>The vizier’s leader-ish abilities are <strong>Hellfire Enchantment</strong> and <strong>Infernal
Advice</strong>. The first is a minor action that grants an ally within 5 squares a +5
fire damage bonus to all its melee attacks until the end of its next turn. The
other is a reaction that allows an ally to reroll a missed attack with a +2
bonus. Hellfire Enchantment is an awesome ability to use on allies that have
multiple attacks on their turns! All of them will get the bonus.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m not gonna lie, these devils feel a bit redundant. Their concept is exactly
the same as all the other sly manipulators, and the only difference is their
power level. They’re the “level 7 sly manipulator”, where imps are “level 3” an
the others are stronger. I also don’t like the emphasis on sin in this book,
because it’s a 3e-ism.</p>

<p>That said, a vizier devil’s stats make it an interesting monster to fight and
they can easily be reskinned into infernal warlord types. They go really well
with melee bruiser monsters that can make multiple attacks. Those can be part of
the entourage of their mortal bosses, or other devils.</p>

<p>This is another devil that breaks the “morphology” guidelines, but it’s kind of
unavoidable this time. After all, they’re associated with Baalzebul, Lord of the
Flies.</p>

<p>Each swarm devil is a singular mind controlling the bodies of an entire swarm of
acidic fiendish flies. According to the book, they’re formed when an angel is
caught lying to its divine master and is torn apart as punishment. The angel’s
soul falls to the Hells and the bits of its body become flies. They roam the
stagnant pools of Maladomni, the Seventh Hell, eternally starving but unable to
die. They can only leave when their master orders them on a mission, which makes
them very happy because it allows them to fly free and eat people for the
duration. It helps that “eating people” usually <em>is</em> the mission. It’s what
swarm devils do best, after all.</p>

<p>Swarm Devils fight by just kinda walking into enemies’ spaces and letting their
flies do the work, and by spewing flies at people they can’t easily reach that
way. As swarms, they’re hard to fight unless you have area-effect weapons and
spells.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>These creatures are Large Immortal Magical Beasts (Devil, Swarm) and Level 18
Skirmishers with 174 HP. They have Darkvision and a flight speed of 10 (hover),
and 20 acid resistance.</p>

<p>They also have the standard swarm traits on top of that: half damage and
immunity to forced movement from melee and ranged attacks; Vulnerable 10 to
close and area attacks; a swarm aura; the ability to occupy the same space as
other characters; and the ability to squeeze through small openings without
slowing down.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura (1) deals 10 acid damage to enemies caught inside. I
think being in the same space as the swarm also counts as being inside the
aura. Their basic <strong>Slams</strong> do no immediate damage, and inflict 10 ongoing acid
damage.</p>

<p>They can channel <strong>Acidic Curses</strong> through their acid, targetting someone taking
ongoing acid damage with a ranged attack that deals psychic damage and inflicts
a -2 penalty to attacks for a turn. Twice per encounter they can <strong>Spew Flies</strong>
in a Close Burst 3, inflicting ongoing acid damage and forcing targets to grant
combat advantage (save ends both).</p>

<p>The “just walking into people” tactic is represented by <strong>Swarm Shift</strong>
(recharge 5+), in which it shifts its speed and deals 15 acid damage to anyone
they pass through.</p>

<p>A good tactic for them is to move in, hit a few people with the slam or spew,
use Swarm Shift to move out of the scrum and keep flinging curses at anyone
who’s melting. Reapply the acid as necessary.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Fly-themed fiends for the Lord of the Flies, nothing unexpected. The
acid/psychic damage mechanic is mildly interesting.</p>

<p>This is another one of those monsters that’s all about blurring the lines
between fiends. These monsters are devils, but they break the design rule that
says devils have a human-like appearance.</p>

<p>Slime Devils are amorphous oozes, though unlike most “true” oozes they’re
sapient and rather smart. They probably originated in some past edition as well,
because they’re the second devil said to be formed from the souls of dead
sinners (which is not a 4e thing). They arise from the mixture of the toxic mud
in the swamps of Minauros with the hatred that seeps from the souls of corrupt
inquisitors who are stuck there. Their abilities make them adept interrogators
and torturers, since they can read the minds of people they envelop and inflict
intense pain on them.</p>

<p>They’re often summoned to act in this capacity by villains in the world, so
they’ll be found alongside those villains’ guards and jailers. In Hell, they
travel with burlier devils, and with those whose controller-y powers can hold
enemies down to be engulfed.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>A Slime Devil is a Medium Immortal Humanoid (Devil, Ooze), and a Level 16 Lurker
with 123 HP. The lore does say their base form is vaguely humanoid, but still
I’d probably classify them as Magical Beasts instead. Either way, it doesn’t
change their other stats.</p>

<p>They have Darkvision, ground and swim speeds of 6, and Resist Acid 20 instead of
the usual devil fire resistance. Their <strong>Mercurial Body</strong> trait allows them to
ignore difficult terrain and not provoke opportunity attacks when
moving. They’re still vulnerable to a Fighter’s Combat Challenge or other
similar abilities, but non-defenders can’t hold them in place.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Caustic Slam</strong> that targets Fortitude and does acid
damage. They can also stretch into <strong>Acidic Tendrils</strong> that attack up to three
creatures at Reach 3, deal immediate and ongoing acid damage, and pull them 2
squares.</p>

<p>The slime devil’s main trick is <strong>Diabolical Engulfment</strong>, which targets reflex
and grabs on a hit. Grabbed targets are dazed and take ongoing 10 acid damage
while the grab lasts. The creature occupies the same space as the victim, and
pulls the victim along when it moves. Attacks that hit the slime devil deal half
damage to it and half damage to the victim.</p>

<p>As a minor action (1/round), the slime devil can use <strong>Scour the Mind</strong> on its
grabbed victim. This targets Will. On a hit, the devil poses a question to the
victim, who must choose between answering truthfully and taking psychic
damage. The amount of damage is the same as a basic attack, which is a lot for a
minor-action power. The creature can do this and still use its basic attack to
fight off the victim’s friends.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Lore-wise, kinda meh. I’m not a fan of bringing the old “fiends come from the
souls of sinners” cliches back into D&amp;D. They’re more interesting mechanically,
because I love attack powers that force PCs to choose between two bad outcomes.</p>
