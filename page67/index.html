<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Drakkoths, also known as Dracotaurs, have been around since at least 3e. They
also look like something I’d find in some of the more exotic BECMI supplements.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Like a number of other peoples, drakkoths are distant relatives of
dragons. Their humanoid half looks like a crested dragonborn, and their
quadruped half like a small wingless dragon.</p>

<p>Drakkoths are nomadic, somewhat insular and territorial, and have enough
technology to make steel weapons. Their preferred terrain are forests and
jungles, and the borders of their claimed territory tend to shift slightly over
time.</p>

<p>According to the book some drakkoth communities worship Tiamat, but others
choose to venerate an individual dragon patron instead. This is most often an
elder or ancient green, given their common terrain preference. I imagine you
could have communities of Bahamut-worshipping or good-dragon-venerating
drakkoths as well. Some dragons actively seek to set themselves as the bosses of
a drakkoth community, because as far as potential servants go they’re a lot more
useful than kobolds.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Drakkoths are very strong and tough, and quite smart as well. They mostly fight
with weapons, to which they apply poison. They tend to wear hide and leather
armor, but you could also say their scaly hides are naturally tough if you’re so
inclined. Their superior movement speed means they favor “cavalry” and
skirmishing tactics.</p>

<p>They can also breathe poison in a manner similar to a green dragon, and are
prone to flying into a rage that leaves them immune to pain when bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="common-traits">Common Traits</h3>

<p>Drakkoths are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Reptile keyword. They have
low-light vision, and their four legs give them a respectable speed of 7. Though
all of them have a breath weapon and a rage ability, the exact effects vary with
each stat block.</p>

<h3 id="drakkoth-ambusher">Drakkoth Ambusher</h3>

<p>This is a Level 13 Skirmisher with 131 HP. It fights with a Reach 2 <strong>glaive</strong>
that does a mix of physical and poison damage. It can also employ a <strong>Sudden
Rush</strong> maneuver (move action; recharge 5-6), allowing it to shift its speed and
make attacks vs. the Reflex of every enemy it moves adjacent to. This does no
damage, but knocks prone on a hit. They also do extra “sneak attack” damage
against an enemy granting <strong>combat advantage</strong> to them.</p>

<p>Their breath weapon is a very dragon-like <strong>Venomous Hiss</strong> (close blast 2
vs. Reflex; recharges when first bloodied). It does poison damage, and ongoing
poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>While bloodied the ambusher enters a <strong>Drakkoth Rage</strong>, which makes it tougher
by granting it 10 temporary HP whenever it hits with an attack.</p>

<h3 id="drakkoth-rager">Drakkoth Rager</h3>

<p>A Level 15 Elite Brute with 366 HP, the rager is a lot more direct in its
approach to combat. It wields a <strong>battleaxe</strong> and can perform a <strong>Raging
Cleave</strong> that does the same damage as the basic attack plus a bit of extra
poison damage in a Close Burst 1. It <em>wants</em> to be surrounded.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Venomous Hiss</strong> and its <strong>Drakkoth Rage</strong> have all the same effects as
those of the ambusher, but the rage also gives it a +2 to attacks and +5 to
damage.</p>

<h3 id="drakkoth-venomshot">Drakkoth Venomshot</h3>

<p>This archer is Level 16 Artillery with 125 HP, and carries a <strong>longsword</strong> and a
<strong>longbow</strong> into combat. Its arrows have a rider that gives the target
Vulnerable 10 Poison (save ends), which pairs nicely with the poisoned weapons
of its buddies.</p>

<p>Instead of the standard Venomous Hiss, it can use a <strong>Venomshot Hiss</strong> that does
less damage but can be used more often, recharging at the end of any turn where
the venomshot is bloodied. Its <strong>Rage</strong> is the same as the ambusher’s.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>In addition to palling around with dragons, drakkoths also train creatures
native to their territories to fight alongside them, and they can make
short-term alliances with neighbors to take down powerful threats.</p>

<p>We get two sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: a rager, two venomshots, and a viscera devourer. I bet there’s an
interesting story behind that one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 16: 3 ambushers, 2 venomshots, and a roc!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I didn’t even remember drakkoths existed before I got to this entry, but these
look interesting. I’m sure you could also reskin bog-standard centarus into
drakkoths and vice-versa.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Drakes make their debut on the first 4e Monster Manual, and this entry brings us
a few more of them. They remain a popular choice of animal for domestication but
the intro text mentions they retain a wild side.</p>

<h2 id="bloodseeker-drake">Bloodseeker Drake</h2>

<p>These expert trackers were included in the Monster Vault, so we already looked
at them <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/01/drakes.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="horned-drake">Horned Drake</h2>

<p>In the wild, horned drakes are pack predators who spend most of the day sleeping
and basking in the sun, going out to hunt at night. They have an excellent
instinct for teamwork, and a pack of them is able to take down much larger prey.</p>

<p>I imagine that, when domesticated, they make stronger alternatives to the
bog-standard guard drake, treating their handlers as part of the pack.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Horned Drakes are Medium Natural Beasts and Level 5 Skirmishers with 63 HP. They
have low-light vision and a speed of 6.</p>

<p>This drake’s basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> that does standard physical damage and
allows the creature to shift 2 squares on a hit. The <strong>Pack Movement</strong> reaction
also allows them to shift 2 squares when an enemy adjacent to them is hit by a
melee attack. This makes them great a setting up flanks with their fellow drakes
or with their handlers.</p>

<p>The drake can also make a <strong>Goring Horns</strong> attack, which does high physical
damage and knocks prone on a hit. It also has a +1 attack bonus over the basic
attack, which indicates to me that it’s meant to be a charge.</p>

<p>So, these drakes are set up charge an enemy, then surround and run circles
around it.</p>

<h2 id="scytheclaw-drake">Scytheclaw Drake</h2>

<p>Another species of pack predator, scytheclaws inhabit forests and
grasslands. They are known for their cunning and for their devious tactics. If
you see one scytheclaw, odds are there are two or three others approaching you
from behind.</p>

<p>In other words, they’re Jurassic Park raptors!</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Scytheclaws are Medium Natural Beasts and Level 10 Skirmishers with 105 HP,
which explains why the Jurassic Park protagonists had such trouble with
them. Their ground speed is an amazing 10.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is the titular <strong>Scytheclaw</strong>, which deals physical damage
and knocks the target prone. If used against an already prone target, it hits
harder and inflicts 5 ongoing damage (save ends).</p>

<p>When the drake hits with its basic attack, it can immediately use <strong>Springing
Step</strong> (free action; recharge 4-6), which allows it to jump 8 squares and attack
someone else at the end of the jump. This doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks
from the target of the original attack, making it safe to move away from most
PCs.</p>

<p>If a prone enemy within reach tries to get up, its <strong>Overwhelming Attacker</strong>
trait allows it to make an opportunity attack against that enemy. If this hits,
the target remains prone.</p>

<p>Scytheclaws are therefore set up to bounce between PCs while knocking them
prone, and they will absolutely kick you when you’re down.</p>

<h2 id="fang-titan-drake">Fang Titan Drake</h2>

<p>If you include the Raptors, you almost certainly have to include the T-Rex as
well. And sure enough, here it is. The largest species of drake, few creatures
other than dragons can pose much of a treat to them. Mostly solitary, they claim
large territories and chase away all other big predators, so ironically
creatures beneath the fang titan’s notice end up enjoying a measure of
protection.</p>

<p>In most settings, such a creature would be impossible to domesticate, but in
D&amp;D’s implied setting some sapients such as giants can manage it due to not
being that much smaller than them.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-2">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Fang Titans are Huge Natural Animals and Level 18 Elite Controllers with 348
HP. Their ground speed is 8.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a humongous <strong>bite</strong> that can target one or two creatures,
dealing physical damage and dazing them (save ends). They can also grab one of
the targets on a hit.</p>

<p>They can also attack with a <strong>Tail Sweep</strong> (close burst 2 vs. Reflex; recharge
4-6) that does high physical damage and knocks prone. Their <strong>Furious Roar</strong>
works exactly like a dragon’s Frightful Presence, and when they’re bloodied they
recharge it and use it immediately as a free action.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters And Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Two sample drake encounters in this entry:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 3: A lizardfolk hunting party with a pair of bloodseeker drakes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 19: A quartet of fire giants and their pet fang titan.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As I mentioned during my reading of the MM/MV, I love drakes and more of them
are always welcome. For many of them, it’s also easy to “de-skin” them as
dinosaurs if you’re so inclined, but making them a distinct type of creature
also frees the authors (and you!) from having to adhere to best paleontological
practices.</p>

<p>Silver dragons have been in the game since the days of AD&amp;D 1st Edition, as part
of the classic metallic dragon set.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Silver dragons are described by the book as “the knights-errant” of
dragonkind. They like to travel the world looking for “interesting conflicts”,
and then throwing themselves at the center of those. When not doing that, they
chill in their lairs, which are usually in cold mountain-tops or in cloud
castles.</p>

<p>Silver dragons are highly susceptible to flattery, but get angry when the people
talking to them behave in an arrogant or aggressive manner. They breathe ice,
but they prefer to mix it up in melee. They can fly, but their flight is slower
than that of most other dragons.</p>

<p>All of this kinda make me think of the “Outrageous!” incarnation of Aquaman from
the “Batman: The Brave and The Bold” cartoon. A silver dragon patterned after
him would be a true ally of justice who travels in search of wrongs to make
right, and who is also really loud and boisterous about it.</p>

<p>You can still have ambiguous or evil silver dragons without changing the written
text, though. Note that it doesn’t make any mention of which side in those
interesting conflicts a silver dragon prefers to join. So a villainous one could
be a mercenary who’s interested in chances to inflict violence and who joins
whoever pays him the most (and the villains almost always have more money in
these scenarios).</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, a silver dragon will want to be where the fighting is
thickest. They’re all about beating people up in melee, and the more surrounded
they are the better their offense becomes. Their cold breath weapon isn’t their
most damaging attack, but it makes enemies vulnerable to damage from other
sources.</p>

<p>Silver dragons are Solo Brutes. They have darkvision, and cold resistance that
starts at 15 and increases by 5 in each subsequent age category. Their ground
speed starts at 6, increases to 8 at Adult, and to 10 at Ancient. Their flight
speed is always equal to the ground speed, making them indeed slower than other
dragons.</p>

<p>Their size progression is pretty standard: starts at Large, grows to Huge at
Elder and Gargantuan at Ancient.</p>

<h3 id="young-silver-dragon">Young Silver Dragon</h3>

<p>These are Level 8 with 376 HP. They have the usual Reach 2 <strong>bite</strong> and
<strong>claws</strong> as basic attacks, doing Brute-level damage. <strong>Dragon Onslaught</strong>
allows them to make a claw attack against every enemy in range in a single
action.</p>

<p>The <strong>Breath Weapon</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude; Recharge 5-6) does light
cold damage and makes targets vulnerable 5 to all damage (save ends). <strong>Bloodied
Breath</strong> and <strong>Frightful Presence</strong> work as usual.</p>

<p>The dragon’s reaction skill is <strong>Wing Slice</strong>, which triggers when it’s hit by
an attack from an enemy flanking it. It makes an attack vs. AC dealing light
physical damage to both the attacker and the other enemy flanking the dragon.</p>

<h3 id="adult-silver-dragon">Adult Silver Dragon</h3>

<p>Adults are level 15 with 608 HP. They have all the abilities of youngsters with
some upgrades and additions.</p>

<p><strong>Dragon Onslaught</strong> adds an extra bite attack, so it’s a claw against everyone
in reach and a bite against a target of the dragon’s choice. They also gain
<strong>Threatening Reach</strong>, allowing them to make opportunity attacks against anyone
they can reach.</p>

<h3 id="elders-silver-dragon">Elders Silver Dragon</h3>

<p>Elders are Level 22 with 840 HP. They’re Huge, but their melee reach remains
at 2. They have bigger numbers and all the abilities of adults, with the
following two additions:</p>

<p><strong>Tail Slam</strong> (close blast 5 vs. AC) does high physical damage and dazes (save
ends). It’s also an at-will action!</p>

<p><strong>Unstoppable</strong> is a passive trait that allows the dragon to roll extra saves
against ongoing damage at the start of its turns.</p>

<h3 id="ancient-silver-dragon">Ancient Silver Dragon</h3>

<p>Ancients are Level 29 with 1072 HP. It has all the abilities of an Elder, with
bigger numbers. It doesn’t gain new abilities, but its bite reach increases to
3, which benefits from Threatening Reach and also improves Dragon Onslaught.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The sample encounters play up the goodly tendencies of a silver dragon, pairing
it up with similarly “righteous” creatures. There’s a Level 8 encounter with a
young’un and 2 eladrin twilight incanters, and a level 17 one with an adult and
2 daeva zealots.</p>

<p>Other likely companions include dwarves, dragonborn, and angels. Mechanically,
you want monsters that can benefit from being shielded by a big brute.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Outrageous! I now totally want to include Arthur the Boisterous Heroic Silver
Dragon in my next game.</p>

<p>Iron Dragons were bit players in 3e, appearing in Dragon Magazine #356 seemingly
as part of an effort to make a dragon for each element in the periodic table. In
4e, they are promoted to the Monster Manual 2 alongside adamantine dragons to
replace the bronze &amp; brass duo that was removed.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Iron dragons are kind of the black sheep of the metallic family, since unlike
most of their relatives they’re surly, anti-social, and underhanded. They lair
in isolated places and prefer terrain that contains plenty of hills, forests,
and other features that provide plenty of hiding spots for large predators such
as themselves.</p>

<p>They still gather followers and henchthings with the promise of generous pay
and/or loot, but they see those as expendable dupes. They’ll send those
followers first to intercept any intruders, and will only join the fight
themselves if doing so looks like it will bring victory. If the hench-people are
severely outmatched, the dragon will get away and leave them to their fate.</p>

<p>As you might have gathered, iron dragons are sneaky and prefer to attack from
ambush. They breathe lightning, and their metallic scales become tougher the
older they get.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Iron dragons are Solo Lurkers, and have Darkvision like all other
dragons. They’re not actually very lurkery aside from a basic level of
sneakiness (Stealth training). Their abilities focus on damage mitigation with a
side order of control, all on top of the standard dragon loadout.</p>

<p>Young’uns start out Large, growing to Huge at Elder and Gargantuan at
Ancient. They have Resist Lightning 15, increasing by 5 per age category beyond
Young. Their speed starts out at 8 both in the ground and in the air, growing to
9/9 at Elder and 9/10 at Gargantuan.</p>

<h3 id="young-iron-dragon">Young Iron Dragon</h3>

<p>Young iron dragons are Level 5 with 268 HP. They have a <strong>bite</strong> that does a mix
of lightning and physical damage, and a <strong>claw</strong> that does about half that in
physical damage. The usual <strong>Double Attack</strong> allows them to claw twice, allowing
them to spread some damage around.</p>

<p>The <strong>Breath Weapon</strong> does lightning damage, as described earlier, and also
pulls 3 squares on a hit. Maybe it magnetizes the dragon for a moment?
<strong>Bloodied Breath</strong> and <strong>Frightful Presence</strong> are here and work as usual.</p>

<p>There’s also <strong>Wing Block</strong>, an interrupt with triggers when the dragon is hit
by a melee attack. This gives the dragon Resist 5 against that attack, and
allows it to make a melee attack dealing light physical damage against the
attacker.</p>

<h3 id="adult-iron-dragon">Adult Iron Dragon</h3>

<p>This one is Level 11 with 472 HP and all the traits of a youngster with bigger
numbers. No new abilities appear at this level.</p>

<h3 id="elder-iron-dragon">Elder Iron Dragon</h3>

<p>Elders are Level 19 and have 740 HP. They have all of the adult’s abilities,
again with bigger numbers all around. Their Double Attack turns into a <strong>Triple
Attack</strong>, allowing for three claw swipes with a single action.</p>

<p>They also gain <strong>Wing Defense</strong> (minor action; recharge 5-6), which grants the
dragon a +2 bonus to all defenses for a turn. As long as it keep recharging,
they can keep using it every turn.</p>

<h3 id="ancient-iron-dragon">Ancient Iron Dragon</h3>

<p>Ancients are Level 26 with 992 HP. They have all of the elder’s abilities and
gain two new ones:</p>

<p><strong>Predator’s Response</strong> is a reaction that triggers when the dragon is hit by a
melee or close attack. It allows the dragon to make a claw attack against the
triggering enemy and shift 2 squares. I now notice the dragon’s reach remains 2
even though it’s now Gargantuan. Either their limbs and neck are comparatively
tiny, or you should increase the reach for the Elder to 3 and the Ancient to 4.</p>

<p><strong>Iron Wing Shroud</strong> (minor action; recharge 6) allows them to make a close
burst 3 vs. AC attack dealing physical damage, and gain resist 15 to all damage
until the start of its next turn. While the damage resistance is active, the
dragon can’t make any attacks. I guess this represents the dragon hiding behind
its wings and catching surrounding enemies in the movement.</p>

<p>The Shroud’s “can’t make attacks” clause is less of a disadvantage than it
seems - an ancient iron dragon can make all of its attacks for the turn and use
the Shroud ability as its last minor action. It will lose access to opportunity
attacks and Predator’s Response, but will be able to act normally when its next
turn rolls around.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>We have two encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: A young iron dragon and 3 dwarf hammerers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 1 adult iron dragon and 2 minotaur warriors.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Both of them would follow the standard pattern I described in the Lore section,
with the lackeys being mercenaries lured by the promise of treasure, only to be
abandoned by their boss when the fight begins to go sideways.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Iron dragons are the ones who least fit the classic metallic dragon stereotype,
which makes sense given their origins as an obscure magazine-only 3.x
dragon. Also I guess it’s hard to make a draconic Lurker who doesn’t sound shady
as fuck.</p>

<p>Still, I like that they’re here. That shadiness is one point in favor of them as
far as their utility in a story goes.</p>

<p>Gold dragons are the original metallics and have been around since the beginning
of D&amp;D.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Gold dragons are among the most powerful children of Io, with the oldest being
among the most dangerous creatures in existence. And yet they’re among the
dragons who most enjoy the company of mortals. I guess a lot of the “scholarly
metallic dragon” stereotype comes from them.</p>

<p>Their preferred terrain are plains or rolling hills, but that’s a secondary
concern. Proximity to a sapient society, or to some great source of magic, are
much more important. Gold dragons like to rule, but it seems they don’t need to
make much of a fuss about it like the other dragons. It just happens! Any
community or society located in gold dragon territory will soon find itself
being heavily influenced or ruled outright by that dragon.</p>

<p>Gold dragons are usually honest and fortright in their dealings, but the more
selfish ones don’t really care about the concerns of “lesser beings”. These
individuals tend to shape the societies under their influence to suit their own
long-term plans regardless of what the actual people who live there might
want. And of course, you can still find more traditionally “Good” gold dragons
out there as well.</p>

<p>Gold dragons breathe fire, and as they age they gain more affinity with radiant
energy as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As usual, we get a stat block for each significant age category of gold
dragon. They’re all Solo Controllers, and have Darkvision.</p>

<p>Young dragons start at size Large, with 15 fire resistance, a ground speed of 8,
and a flight speed of 10 with Hover. They gain another 5 fire resistance with
each subsequent age category, and their flight speed increases to 12 at
Elder. They grow to size Huge at Elder, and Gargantuan at Ancient.</p>

<h3 id="young-gold-dragon">Young Gold Dragon</h3>

<p>Young Golds are Level 9 Solo Controllers with 380 HP. Their melee reach is 2,
and their basic attacks are a <strong>bite</strong> that does a mix of physical and fire
damage, and a weaker <strong>claw</strong>. <strong>Double Attack</strong> allows them to claw twice in a
single action, bringing claw damage almost to parity with the bite. I guess it’s
good if they want to spread damage around rather than concentrate it.</p>

<p>If an adjacent creature hits the dragon, it can hit back with a <strong>Fiery Wing
Riposte</strong> (melee 1 vs. Fortitude), which pushes the impudent mortal 5 squares
and inflicts 5 ongoing fire damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Their <strong>Breath Weapon</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Reflex; recharge 5-6) does fire
damage and weakens (save ends), or half damage on a miss. <strong>Bloodied Breath</strong>
and <strong>Frightful Presence</strong> work as usual.</p>

<h3 id="adult-gold-dragon">Adult Gold Dragon</h3>

<p>Adults are Level 17 with 652 HP. As usual they have all the attacks of a
youngster with bigger numbers. This includes the ongoing damage from the
Riposte, which is now 10.</p>

<p>They also gain a new ability: <strong>Burning Tomb</strong> (area burst 1 within 20
vs. Reflex; recharge 6) is a spell that does the same fire damage as the breath
weapon, immobilizes (save ends), and creates a zone that does 15 fire damage to
anyone who starts their turn inside and can be sustained with minor actions.</p>

<h3 id="elder-gold-dragon">Elder Gold Dragon</h3>

<p>Elders are Level 24 with a cool 888 HP. They have all the abilities of adults
with bigger numbers. Their Melee Reach increases to 3 due to their Huge size.</p>

<p>This is at the age where their radiance begins to have a game effect, giving
them a new ability: <strong>Beguiling Glow</strong> (close burst 8 vs. Will; enemies only;
recharge 5-6) is a minor-action attack that does no damage and pulls targets 5
squares on a hit, nicely setting them up for Burning Tomb or the breath weapon.</p>

<p>They also project an aura (2) of <strong>Weakening Flames</strong>, which forces enemies
caught inside to choose between taking 15 fire damage or being weakened for a
turn.</p>

<h3 id="ancient-gold-dragon">Ancient Gold Dragon</h3>

<p>Ancient Gold Dragons are Gargantuan Level 30 Solo Controllers with 1088 HP. This
puts them on par with the friggin’ Tarrasque both in size and danger level. The
Tarrasque has more HP, but that’s before you apply the MM2 Solo HP fixes. And
the dragon is much smarter.</p>

<p>They have all the abilities of Elders with bigger numbers, including in reach,
aura size and damage, and ongoing damage from Riposte. Double Attack becomes
<strong>Triple Attack</strong>, allowing three claw swipes in one action. Their new
“capstone” skill is <strong>Ancient Radiance</strong> (close burst 4 vs. Fortitude; enemies
only; recharge 6) which does radiant damage and dazes for a turn. After the daze
clears, the target gains Vulnerable 10 Radiant (save ends). This is important
because the dragon’s <strong>Breath Weapon</strong> now does “fire and radiant” damage!</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Gold dragons surround themselves with allies and subjects that match their
individual dispositions. The evil ones employ beings such as evil minotaurs,
ogres and trolls as dumb disposable muscle. The good ones have a variety of
willing allies acting as guards.</p>

<p>The sample encounters are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: a young gold dragon and 2 angels of valor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 19: an adult gold dragon and 3 savage minotaurs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Level-wise, these are certainly the most powerful of dragons. The Ancient is a
match for the Tarrasque and could put up a decent fight against beings such as
demon lords or other “campaign end bosses”.</p>

<p>They do have the same problem as the Tarrasque in that they lack strong
condition mitigation powers - that +5 to saves from being a solo might not be
enough to prevent stun-locking by an epic party. They also wouldn’t do so well
on their own against Demogorgon, so if you want to have a kaiju fight you might
want to use the dragon as an ally of the PCs instead of sending it in alone.</p>
