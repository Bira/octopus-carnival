<p>Today is Valentine’s Day in the US, so this is me making eyes at you. Not that
kind of eyes, though.</p>

<p>In Dragon’s Dogma, the creatures known as Eyes are pure monsters: they have no
natural habitat or ecological niche. They are an expression of corruption from
beyond the Rift, appearing only in places where the world’s veil is thin and
supernatural evil is abundant. While they are living creatures, their forms and
anatomy don’t even pay lip service to normal phisiological principles. Tough
highly intelligent, they never communicate or negotiate, and always try to kill
non-Eyes that run into them.</p>

<p>They come in several varieties, all of which share some of the characteristics
of the Eye of Death found in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 1</strong>, p. 14. In fact, the
Eye of Death could easily be another member of the this monster family.</p>

<p><strong>Update (2017-02-21)</strong>: The Gazer has its own stat block now, and is even
nastier with the addition of a couple more gaze attacks.</p>

<h2 id="vile-eyes">Vile Eyes</h2>

<p>The smallest of the bunch, Vile Eyes look like fleshy spheres with a single
lidless eye always staring ahead. While they are not as agile or perceptive as
an Eye of Death, they share the same death gaze ability and can protect
themselves with a nigh-impenetrable energy barrier. Fortunately for their
victims, they can’t do both of those things at the same time. Switching from the
barrier to one of the other powers and back requires a Concentrate maneuver,
giving the PCs a window in which to hit them.</p>

<p>Unlike their larger cousins described in this article, Vile Eyes are usually
found in small groups. Despite their small amount of HP, they are usually
worthies.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 5; <strong>DX</strong> 10; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> -1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 8; <strong>DR</strong> 0;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 10; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 10</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 5.5; <strong>Move</strong> 5 (Air).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Magic Barrier (-)</strong>: Gives the Vile Eye DR 30 and Magic Resistance 10 while
up.</li>
  <li><strong>Death Gaze (Resisted by HT-5)</strong>: 1d toxic damage. Range 20. Cosmic, ignores
DR.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 5; Dark Vision (Color Vision); Doesn’t Breathe; Doesn’t
Eat or Drink; Doesn’t Sleep; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards; Injury Tolerance (No
Brain, No Neck, No Vitals);</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Elder Thing.</p>

<h2 id="evil-eyes">Evil Eyes</h2>

<p>Not to be confused with Vile Eyes, these things are leathery spheres over three
meters in diameter whose body is dominated by a huge fanged maw that opens to
reveal the central eye. A large number of tentacles protrude from the central
body, each one thick as a human leg and tipped by yet another maw. They are
invariably highly proficient spellcasters in addition to possessing debilitating
gaze attacks and a barrier similar to that of the Vile Eyes. The monster’s
tentacles reach beyond the barrier and thus are always vulnerable, but that also
means it doesn’t need to lower the barrier to attack with them!</p>

<p>Evil Eyes are solitary, and they like to clear out a large, spacious portion of
whatever dungeon or region they emerge in for use as a lair. For all anyone
knows, they just sit there waiting for intruders to kill - stories about Evil
Eye lairs tend to be about mysterious places no one returns from. Very few
people know of the creature’s existence. They are obviously boss monsters.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 35; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 16; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +3; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>DR</strong> 5 (body), 0 (eye, tentacles);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 35; <strong>Will</strong> 16; <strong>Per</strong> 16; <strong>FP</strong> 30</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 5 (Air).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Magic Barrier (-)</strong>: Gives the Evil Eye DR 30 and Magic Resistance 10 while
up.</li>
  <li><strong>Debilitating Gaze (-)</strong>: Works as Dispel Magic cast at skill 20. The target
must also resist with HT-5 or be Stunned for seconds equal to the margin of
failure. Range 30.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (14)</strong>: Damage 4d-2 imp. Reach C.</li>
  <li><strong>Tentacle Bite x8 (16)</strong>: 1d imp, plus the target is automatically grappled
at ST 15. Reach 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Spells (-)</strong>: Any the GM deems appropriate, at skill 20 for Hard spells and
19 for Very Hard ones.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 5; Dark Vision (Color Vision); Doesn’t Breathe; Doesn’t
Eat or Drink; Doesn’t Sleep; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards; Indomitable; Injury
Tolerance (No Brain, No Neck, No Vitals); Magery 5; See Invisible; Unfazeable;
Vibration Sense (Air).</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Elder Thing.</p>

<h3 id="tentacles">Tentacles!</h3>

<p>The Evil Eye’s eight tentacles act as indepentent characters. They have ST and
HP 15, Dodge 10, and attack using the statistics shown on the main Evil Eye stat
block. Once they grapple a target, they’ll attempt to drag them to the Eye’s
maw. Multiple tentacles can cooperate in this!</p>

<p>Damaging a tentacle doesn’t damage the Eye itself. Bringing a tentacle to 0 HP
severs it and takes it out of the fight… but the Eye can spend 5 Concentrate
maneuvers with its barrier down to instantly regenerate all of its tentacles!</p>

<h2 id="the-gazer">The Gazer</h2>

<p>Is this particularly ancient Evil Eye? The progenitor of the whole species?
Something else? No one knows. Its true form cannot exist all at once in our
dimension, but the visible bits are an even larger Evil Eye with an even more
terrible bite. It can use both the Evil Eye’s debilitating gaze and the Vile
Eye’s lethal one at will, as well as cast spells or simply slam victims with its
incredible bulk.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 55; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 16; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +5; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>DR</strong> 5 (body), 0 (eye, tentacles);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 55; <strong>Will</strong> 16; <strong>Per</strong> 16; <strong>FP</strong> 50</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 5 (Air).</p>

  <li><strong>Magic Barrier (-)</strong>: Gives the Gazer DR 30 and Magic Resistance 10 while up.</li>

  <li><strong>Debilitating Gaze (-)</strong>: Works as Dispel Magic cast at skill 20. The target
must also resist with HT-5 or be Stunned for seconds equal to the margin of
failure. Range 30.</li>
  <li><strong>Petryfing Gaze (20 vs. HT)</strong>: As Flesh to Stone (<strong>Magic</strong>, p.51). Range 20.</li>
  <li><strong>Blinding Gaze (20 vs. HT)</strong>: As Strike Blind (<strong>Magic</strong>, p. 38). Range 20.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (16)</strong>: Damage 6d imp. Reach C.</li>
  <li><strong>Tentacle Bite x16 (16)</strong>: 2d imp, plus the target is automatically grappled
at ST 20. Reach 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Spells (-)</strong>: Any the GM deems appropriate, at skill 20 for Hard spells and
19 for Very Hard ones.</li>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Elder Thing.</p>

<h3 id="even-more-tentacles">Even More Tentacles!</h3>

<p>The main spherical body has no tentacles, but the creature can summon up to 16
of them from rifts that open in the walls or floor <em>and move around at Move
4</em>. Severing a tentacle only means it will be automatically replaced by another
in 2 turns.</p>

            <p>Octopus Carnival now has enough material in it that I thought it was time for a
little organization. At the top of the site you should now see a “Projects”
link, which will take to a page linking to all of the big thematic post
collections I’m working on or have finished already. From there, you can go to
individual project pages that discuss its overall goals and link to every
individual post.</p>

<p>As of this post, I have pages for the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">Dragon’s Dogma adaptation</a>, and my
collection of <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics/">GURPS stats for Pathfinder Iconics</a>. If you haven’t followed
either of those from the beginning, now would be an excellent time to get
reacquainted with them.</p>

<p>In the future, I’ll add tag support to the blog to make it even easier to
navigate between posts in a project.</p>

            <p>This is the sixth post of a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to
<strong>GURPS</strong>. Previous posts can be found below:</p>

<p>In Gransys, the word “undead” applies to those walking corpses more commonly
known as <em>zombies</em> in other media, but here we use it in the more traditional
Dungeon Fantasy sense to encompass all sorts of horrors from the grave. Undead
make up a large enemy subtype that remains relevant all through the original
game, so any discussion of them necessarily involves spoilers.</p>

<p>Undead in Gransys are generally similar to those found in countless other
fantasy settings. They infest any place that has seen a great deal of death and
not much in the way of ritual purification, or where dark forces are actively at
work. Since many dungeons fall into both categories, they tend to have a lot of
undead.</p>

<p>These creatures tend to be more active at night, and while it’s common to find
large groups of undead they rarely cooperate with other types of monster, which
they view as targets just like any other living creature. In large dungeons,
undead and living monsters tend to have distinct territories and keep to them,
with the occasional fight redefining their borders.</p>

<h2 id="zombies">Zombies</h2>

<p>There’s little to say about the zombies of Gransys that hasn’t been said a
thousand times elsewhere. They’re slow, they moan a lot, they come in large
numbers and they like holding you down and biting you to death. The Horde
Zombies from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 2</strong> and the Servitor Zombie from <strong>DF 9</strong>
should do nicely to represent the bulk of them. Of note is that Gransys zombies
are usually <em>not</em> infectious. They rise because of necromancy, ambient dark
magic, or divine curse, not a plague. Of course, an industrious coven of
necromancers could still get a zombie infestation going by doing all the
animating themselves.</p>

<p>Interesting zombie variations include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Zombie Warrior: Increase ST and give them skill equal to DX with a
weapon. Give them a suit of armor and a weapon covered by the skill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Giant zombie: <em>Double</em> ST, increase SM to +1, and add Resistant to Turning
(+3).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="skeletons">Skeletons</h2>

<p>Common skeletons are little more than faster, more fragile zombies, but they get
interesting rather quickly. Like zombies, they don’t keep any of the original
person’s memories or personality, but they do often retain their skills!
Skeletons that rise from old battlefields tend to be skilled soldiers. Old
temples and mage towers will often contain skeleton <em>wizards</em>. None of them can
improve on these skills after death, but if a 400-point delver falls in the
depths of a death-tainted dungeon, they’re likely to become terrible monsters.</p>

<p>Basic skeletons were commoners in life, and follow the Servitor Skeleton
template from <strong>DF 9</strong> without any weapons or other equipment. For more
dangerous specimens, create a human opponent and apply the Servitor Skeleton
modifiers as a racial template. Using some of the ready-made
opposition <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/07/human-enemies.html">here</a> works, but unique high-point skeletons also exist.</p>

<h2 id="ghosts">Ghosts</h2>

<p>Ghosts are incorporeal undead that resemble spheres of eerie light. They tend to
appear at night over bodies of water, but some may also appear in drier settings
if they died there. In either case, ghosts never stray too far from the site of
their death. Ghosts attack by “entering” a victim and slowly draining their
life. This is erroneously referred to as possession by the inhabitants of
Gransys, but the victim is still in control of their actions while this goes on.</p>

<p>Physical attacks pass harmlessly through these creatures, but spells affect them
normally. Properly fighting them requires a magician with the right spells -
Affect Spirits or “pure energy” attack spells like Fireball or Sunbolt. A group
that lacks any of this is reduced to running and hoping they get far enough away
from the creature’s territory before they succumb to it</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> –; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 6; <strong>HT</strong> 10</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> -1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 8; <strong>DR</strong> 0;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 10; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 10</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 5.5; <strong>Move</strong> 10 (flight with Hover).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Drain Life (12 vs. Will)</strong>: Causes injury equal to the margin of
victory. Cosmic, ignores DR. If the ghost is wounded, it heals the same amount
of HP. The ghost must touch the victim to use this attack.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Flight;  Insubstantial (not vs. Magic);  Immunity to Metabolic
Hazards; Injury Tolerance (No Blood, No Brain, No Neck, No Vitals, Homogenous);
Fragile (Unnatural); No Manipulators; Divine Curse (must stay within 20m of
place of death), Supernatural Features (Glows).</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Undead.</p>

<h2 id="wights-and-liches">Wights and Liches</h2>

<p>The prime example of sapient undead in Gransys, these are powerful spellcasters
who used forbidden magic to turn themselves into immortal undead. They retain
their memories and personality and can keep on improving in their craft after
the transformation. The difference between a wight and a lich is one of degree,
not of kind - a wight is simply a lich who’s still relatively new to the
business.</p>

<p>For both, use the Lich from <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 1</strong> as a starting
point. Wights generally have less of everything that makes a Lich dangerous:
spells, Magery, IQ, resources and minions. Proper liches use the published
stats.</p>

<p>A note on the Unkillable trait: this is a big feature of the published Lich, but
the video game doesn’t seem to ascribe anything like this to its version of them
aside from the tendency all monsters there have of respawning after a while. The
easiest way to translate this would be to split the difference and say Wights
don’t possess the Trait, as they’ve yet to master the trick to it. As variant
mana levels are very rare in Gransys, it could make sense to have liches use the
more traditional philactery instead.</p>

<p>A lich that has a philactery as its weakness still has Unkillable 3: to kill
such a creature, both the philactery and its current body must be destroyed. If
the PCs somehow manage to deal with the philactery first, they must still
contend with the Lich, and do so before it has time to make another philactery
to kill it for good.</p>

            <p>I’m still working on the next post in the Dragon’s Dogma Bestiary, but I saw
something neat today and thought I had to share it and make a few comments of my
own.</p>

<p>The Hard Maths blog has an interesting article on <a href="https://hardmaths.blogspot.com.br/2017/01/grimoire-elemental-melee-spells.html">Elemental Melee Spells</a>
up. These create weapons of pure energy from nothing, and might be an
interesting addition to the arsenal of a <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/20/characters-mystic-knight.html">Mystic Knight</a>!</p>

<p>Such a character would probably value mystical power more than physical might,
as the spells don’t add to the users ST for damage and a final skill level of
15+ is vital for maintaining them for any appreciable length of time. They also
need Force Sword, a skill which would have no other use in a fantasy
setting… which means there’s a secretive order of elementalists that teaches
it along with the spells somewhere out there.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Octopus Carnival is back from is hiatus! I’ll resume my writing here with an
article that’s not directly related to any of my ongoing projects. One goes
where inspiration strikes, after all.</p>

<p>Inspiration in this case came from <a href="https://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com.br/2013/05/my-modified-df-mook-rule.html">this post</a> from Peter V. Dell’Orto over
at Dungeon Fantastic, about how the mook rules he uses on his Dungeon Fantasy
campaign. That got me thinking about the several different iteration of these
rules present both in GURPS itself and on other systems. In this article I’ll
talk a bit about those and introduce a variation on them that I’ll likely use
for my own games.</p>

<h2 id="minions-with-many-names">Minions With Many Names</h2>

<p>Mooks, Minions, Extras… by now the concept of them is probably well-known to
most roleplayers, as a bunch of RPG systems has been codifying the concept for
decades now. Since every game has a different name for this rule and I don’t
want to keep listing them all, I’ll use the name “Minions” in this article.</p>

<p>Simply put, minions are weak enemies that pose little threat to player
characters individually, and who are present in the game mostly to show case how
competent said PCs are. They have simplified statistics and usually go down with
one good hit from a PC. They take inspiration from a long line of action and
adventure movies, where it’s common for the badass protagonists to mow through a
large group of minions over the course of an action scene, or on the way to
fighting a tough, named foe. They also tend to feature heavily in chase scenes,
where their narrative purpose is to crash and burn with every maneuver the hero
pulls off to confound them.</p>

<p>The <em>concept</em> of minions has been around since the early days of D&amp;D and its
hordes of low-HD enemies pitted against mid- or high-level parties. The first
time I saw it explicitly named and codified was with Exalted and its rules for
Extras, though it almost certainly wasn’t the first system to do so. Many others
tried their hand at it, including D&amp;D 4th Edition with its Minion rules.</p>

<p>GURPS itself has multiple sets of minion rules. In the core book, each minion is
an individual opponent: they always go down in one hit, and they never use
Active Defenses (but also never All-Out-Attack either). <strong>GURPS Action</strong> and
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong> toughen them up a bit by allowing active defenses and
allowing for several different grades of opposition. <em>Swarms</em> are large groups
of “minions” treated like a single, abstract creature, and again we have a
version in the <strong>Basic Set</strong> and a couple more elaborate ones in <strong>Dungeon
Fantasy</strong> and other sources. I’m sure people have come up with their own
variations as well. So here’s mine! It’s focused on distinct individuals rather
than on swarms. For now, I’ll use the standard published rules for those.</p>

<h2 id="octopus-opposition">Octopus Opposition</h2>

<p>This is how I intend to grade my opposition from now on, from weakest to
strongest. The system takes inspiration from the existing GURPS rules, and also
from the several different grades of opposition presented by D&amp;D 4th Edition and
early Shadowrun (with its Professional Levels).</p>

<p>Please note that this system is most appropriate for cinematic games that follow
at least <em>some</em> “action movie” conventions regardless of their point
level. Grimly realistic games should stick to the <strong>Basic Set</strong> rules (which are
the equivalent of making all enemies Elite under this system). Campaigns that
sit somewhere in the middle could ellide the lower opposition grades and make
everyone at least a Worthy.</p>

<p>While higher-grade opposition is <em>usually</em> more skilled at fighting
than lower-grade foes, its final grade is as much a matter of narrative
importance as of pure power. In a campaign following action-movie narrative
rules, you are more likely to find higher-grade enemies the closer you are to
the story’s climax, or to your mission objective. Named NPCs are also more
likely to be of a higher grade than the troops they command even if they are
equally skilled, because the GM usually wants the NPC to stick around for a bit
longer and be memorable.</p>

<p>This also means that it’s perfectly possible for a given individual to move
between these grades depending on the circumstances of the story. That one lucky
goblin minion that managed to inflict significant damage on the party and escape
without a scratch might return as a worthy or better at a latter date if the
players become obsessed with defeating it. In the case of Horde Ninjas, this
progression could happen over the course of a single fight!</p>

<p>Belonging to a specific grade is always a “campaign feature” and as such never
costs or gives points.</p>

<h3 id="minions">Minions</h3>

<p>Minions are the equivalent of fodder in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> or <strong>Action</strong>. They
fight and defend themselves normally, but it only takes a single point of damage
getting past their DR to bring them down. This doesn’t necessarily represent
killing. A “downed” minion might be unconscious, wounded, or even actively
fleeing! Whatever happens, though, they <em>are</em> 100% out of the fight at that
point. Obviously, it’s still possible to interact with a defeated minion who is
still alive after the fight.</p>

<p>While minions can theoretically have very high skill levels and fight with fancy
techniques, they usually don’t. They tend to come in large numbers and their
tactics leverage that. This grade is appropriate for those goblin and dinoman
hordes, cheap hired thugs, or the regular forces of the evil Star Empire. Any
monster called out as fodder in official materials would be a minion under this
system.</p>

<h3 id="tough-minions">Tough Minions</h3>

<p>Also known as “purple” minions for entirely jocular reasons. They’re like
regular minions, but a little more ornery. A tough minion has an HP total like a
normal character, but always fails combat-related HT rolls. This means that any
hit that forces a “Knockdown and Stunning” roll will take them out, as will
reaching 0 HP or less. They can take a few scratches and keep going, but a solid
hit still breaks them. These are basically Petter V. Dell’Orto’s fodder
monsters, though they never recover from stunning before the fight ends. They do
recover in time afterwards, of course.</p>

<p>This grade is appropriate for pretty much the same types of foe as normal
minions in those cases where the GM wants to make things a bit more challenging,
or when the group in question has a reputation for strength but the GM doesn’t
want them to steal the scene. They’re your goblin veterans, experienced
mobsters, or those Imperial soldiers with the black armor that talk in sinister
coded radio transmissions.</p>

<h3 id="worthies">Worthies</h3>

<p>Worthies are the “standard” level of opposition. They defend themselves
normally, including making HT rolls to avoid and recover from knockdown and
stunning, but go down once they reach 0 HP or less. They’re a significant
obstacle, but you still don’t want them to stick around <em>too</em> long. The same
examples listed for Tough Minions also make suitable worthies, as does any
monster from the books not specifically listed as fodder.</p>

<p>Worthies still tend to come in groups, though these will be smaller than groups
of minions. A movie fight against five or six opponents who keep getting back up
after being hit is employing worthies instead of minions! Note that this doesn’t
mean worthies are necessarily low-skill opponents. At this level, there is no
inconsistency whathosever in making them as skilled as the PCs themselves.</p>

<h3 id="elites">Elites</h3>

<p>Elite enemies are treated just like PCs. They make full use of all of the
campaign’s combat rules. When they reach 0 HP or less, they’ll keep making HT
rolls to stay conscious and alive, and might fight to the death if they think
it’s warranted. When they don’t, retreating is always their own decision rather
than something the rules force them to do. Elites are almost always named NPCs
with their own personalities and motivations. They are rarely less skilled than
the PCs themselves, and are often better. A fight against such an opponent
usually marks an important plot milestone in adventures following movie logic.</p>

<p>Any enemy from the books who is supposed to still pose a threat when under 0 HP
is probably an Elite. Boss Monsters from <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> also fit here -
they are usually more <em>powerful</em> in terms of statistics, but they receive the
same level of plot protection as the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="special">Special</h3>

<p>Every category system needs a catch-all! Special opposition has something that
gives it even <em>more</em> narrative protection than the PCs, or that makes it not
quite fit in the ranking system above. Colossi with multiple parts that must be
destroyed in order? Multi-stage bosses that switch character sheets entirely
when defeated?  Anything goes!</p>
