            <p>That’s it. I’m done with Kickstarter. It’s just too much of a hassle.</p>

<p>After an excruciating process that involved 2 permanently blocked credit cards,
a 2-week wait for the replacements to arrive, a third (thankfully virtual)
blocked card, a total of 2 hours of trying to convince the nice people at my
bank and/or credit card operator that I was myself and that I did indeed want my
card unblocked and that transaction completed, I’m finally an official backer of
the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2101297466/hall-of-judgment-a-dungeon-fantasy-rpg-supplement">Hall of Judgment campaign</a> and have the preview PDF on hand.</p>

<p>Now, the thing with all the blocked cards was a first for me<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but the rest
has been pretty much par of the course every single time I backed a KS
project. It seems like either my bank (Banco do Brasil) or VISA <em>really</em> hate
the way KS charges Brazilian cards. It always gets flagged as a security
violation and there seems to be no way to let them know beforehand that it’s
really OK. And by now I’m really tired of this whole Kafkaesque nightmare.</p>

<p>So until one or more of these corporations comes up with a better way to take my
money, I won’t back anything else on Kickstarter and will instead wait for the
stuff I’m interested in to be available through normal channels.</p>

            <p>I thought Gaming Ballistic’s Lost Hall of Tyr<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> looked like an interesting
adventure when it came out, but I didn’t buy it because it was for D&amp;D 5th
Edition. I did think at the time that it would be really nifty if it ever came
out for GURPS… and now I’m about to get my wish.</p>

<p>Gaming Ballistic has recently starter another kickstarter campaign for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2101297466/hall-of-judgment-a-dungeon-fantasy-rpg-supplement">Hall of
Judgement</a>, which is a version of the same adventure for the Dungeon Fantasy
Roleplaying Game.</p>

<p>It’s not a direct conversion. The setting part has been made a bit more generic
so it can fit into ongoing DFRPG campaigns, and the adventure itself has been
expanded to be more sandboxy, with more wilderness travel and a few sidequests
added in. It’s also the first ever licensed third-party supplement for the
DFRPG, so I’m backing this not just for the book itself but to send a message to
Steve Jackson games that I want to see more of this type of deal.</p>

<p>So you found a passage to fantasy world full of magic and wonder at the back of
your grandmother’s old walk-in closet. You’ve read about things like this
before, and you’re thinking of going in and <del>raiding the place for treasure</del>
having a wholesome and memorable sightseeing trip. What should you take in your
expedition?</p>

<p>The first thing that comes to a lot of player’s minds in a game like this are
guns, but we’re not going to talk about that here. Plenty of other people
already did, for once: there’s at least one Pyramid article about it, and GURPS
Loadouts: Monster Hunters gives you a very complete treatment of what guns to
take to fight monsters. No, we’re going to talk about all the <em>other</em> stuff that
plays a role in keeping you alive: camping and expedition gear!</p>

<p>That sort of equipment is vital to every traditional dungeon fantasy adventurer
and no less important for modern PCs venturing into such worlds. In fact, the
less combat your game features, the more important this gear becomes. Even if
the game is a pure dungeon crawl, that closet portal might not open directly
into the dungeon. And even if it does you might have a hard time coming back
home and might have to stay on the other side for a while. And who knows, maybe
your game actually <em>is</em> about a wholesome and memorable sightseeing trip, making
the journey the whole point.</p>

<p>Modern camping gear is often much lighter and better at its job than the TL 3
equivalents, and can give you as much of a comparative edge to traveling and
survival as a brace of guns would give for combat. The loadouts described below
are supposed to be modern versions of the Minimal, Deluxe, and Group kits
described in GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 13: Loadouts. They assume an incursion into
the fantasy realm might take several days but won’t last <em>forever</em>, so taking
things that require batteries or fuel is allowed. All modern gear and attending
rules are taken from GURPS High-Tech.</p>

<p>The goal is for these loadouts to be at least as effective and no heavier than
the originals - if possible they should be both lighter and better. They’re
inevitably going to end up being more <em>expensive</em>, but even a “settled” modern
character has access to four times the entire life savings of a starting
medieval adventurer, so keeping price down isn’t as big of a priority.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-clothing">A Note on Clothing</h2>

<p>If you follow the rules from High-Tech, your weight savings start with the good
old set of Ordinary Clothing every character gets! The totally generic set from
Dungeon Fantasy weights 1 kg (2 lbs.), but TL 8 garments weight half that. It
might not seem much, but every pound you save is another pound of treasure you
can bring home! The same savings would apply to winter and arctic clothing,
which is good news if that portal opens into a winter wasteland.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-food">A Note on Food</h2>

<p>After looking at the options for travel-ready food in High-Tech, it turns out
the generic “Traveler’s Rations” from Dungeon Fantasy are already as close to
optimal as you can get in terms of weight per meal at 0.25kg/0.5lbs. Few of the
“realistic” rations presented in High-Tech weight less than that. I went with
Survival Tablets for travel rations here because they feel high-tech, weight
about half of what the generic rations do, and can be eaten on the move just
like those rations.</p>

<p>World-hopping delvers who insist on eating actual food and don’t mind doing a
bit of campfire cooking can instead pack meals of Freeze-Dried Food (p. HT 35)
and bring along a titanium Personal Mess Kit (p. HT57, $45, 0.15kg/0.3 lbs). The
price and weight per meal of the two types of ration is close enough that the
only difference for the whole loadout is the price and weight of the mess kit.</p>

<h2 id="minimal-modern-delvers-kit">Minimal Modern Delver’s Kit</h2>
<h3 id="424-705kg1410-lbs">$424, 7.05kg/14.10 lbs</h3>

<p>This kit provides a 30% weight savings over its medieval version, a much better
light source, a much stronger rope, and a +1 to Survival rolls because of the
sleeping bag.</p>

<p>The included batteries can last you for days. A set of spare batteries for all
powered equipment here costs $4 and weights 0.4kg (0.8 lbs.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sleeping Bag (p. HT56) <strong>[Torso]</strong>: +1 to Survival. $100, 1 kg (2 lbs.).</li>
  <li>UV purifier (p. HT 59) <strong>[Torso]</strong>: Holds 1L of water, which it purifies in
1-2 minutes. Given weight is for a full container. $100, 1.25kg (2.5 lbs.)</li>
  <li>Batteries for UV purifier (p. HT 13) <strong>[UV purifier]</strong>: 4 XS batteries, good
for 20L. $2, weight already included.</li>
  <li>Backpack, Small (p. HT54) <strong>[Torso]</strong>: Holds 25kg (50 lbs.). $120, 1.5kg (3
lbs.).</li>
  <li>Personal Basics (p. B288 or HT53) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: $5, 0.5kg (1 lb.).</li>
  <li>Bottle of Survival Tablets x 2 (p. HT35) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: Provides nutrients
equivalent to 12 meals in total. $50, 1.5kg (3 lbs.)</li>
  <li>Rope, 1cm (3/8”), 10m (p. HT56) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: Synthetic. Supports 325kg (650
lbs.). $25, 0.8kg (1.6 lbs.).</li>
  <li>Flashlight (p. HT52) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: 10m beam. $20, 0.5kg (1 lb.).</li>
  <li>Batteries for Flashlight (p. HT 13) <strong>[Flashlight]</strong>: 2 S batteries, good for
50 hours of illumination. $2, weight already included.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deluxe-modern-delvers-kit">Deluxe Modern Delver’s Kit</h2>
<h3 id="393-641kg1282-lbs">+$393, +6,41kg/12,82 lbs</h3>

<p>Like the original version, this is an add-on to the corresponding minimal
kit. It weights a little over a <em>quarter</em> of the corresponding add-on kit and
it’s cheaper, though the basic and deluxe kits combined are still a bit more
expensive than the originals. The tent included here combines with the sleeping
bag from the basic kit to add a combined +2 tool bonus to Survival. The price of
the whole package ($817) also falls well within the budget of even a “settled”
TL8 adventurer.</p>

<p>Further sets of spare batteries for the lantern add $4, 0.66kg (1.21 lbs) each.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Backpack, Large (p. HT55) <strong>[Torso]</strong>: Replaces the minimal kit’s Small
Backpack. Holds 50kg (100 lbs.). $200, 2.5kg (5 lbs.)</li>
  <li>Dive-Certified Electric Lantern (p. HT 51) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: 5m radius. $60,
1.5kg (3 lbs.)</li>
  <li>Batteries for Lantern (p . HT 13) <strong>[Lantern]</strong>: 4 S batteries, good for 20
hours of illumination. $4, weight already included.</li>
  <li>Spare Batteries for Lantern (p. HT 13) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: $4, 0.66kg (1.21 lbs.)</li>
  <li>Load-Bearing Vest (p. HT54) <strong>[Torso]</strong>: $30, 1kg (2 lbs).</li>
  <li>Bottle of Survival Tablets (p. HT35) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: Provides nutrients
equivalent to 6 meals. $25, 0.75kg (1.5lbs).</li>
  <li>Rope, 1.25cm (1/2”), 10m (p. HT56) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: Synthetic. Supports 2
tons. $90, 1kg (2 lbs).</li>
  <li>Tent, Personal (p. HT57) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: +1 to Survival. $100, 0.5kg (1 lb).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modern-group-kit">Modern Group Kit</h2>
<h3 id="563-29kg58-lbs">+$563, +29kg/58 lbs</h3>

<p>As I write the modern version of DF’s Group Kit, I notice it gets harder to find
high-tech replacements for some of the stuff here. First-Aid Kits cost and
weight the same, though obviously the TL8 version is a lot better than the
medieval equivalent. We can replace the crowbar and shovel with titanium
versions from Low-Tech for a little weight savings, but there’s no listed
high-tech substitute for the good old pickaxe. High-Tech also doesn’t talk about
Group Basics, opting to break that convenient abstraction down into its
components. However, I believe it’s safe to assume that like Personal Basics the
modern version costs and weights the same but includes more modern items (like
a camp stove and its propane tank).</p>

<p>The resulting kit is still quite a bit lighter than the original because TL 8
tents are awesome, and fits entirely into a single large backpack with some room
to spare. The party can still opt to split its items among themselves if they
don’t manage to make a half-ogre barbarian friend in the fantasy realm.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Backpack, Large (p. HT55) <strong>[Torso]</strong>: Holds 50kg (100 lbs.). $200, 2.5kg (5
lbs.)</li>
  <li>Crowbar, Titanium (p. HT30) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: $50, 1kg (2 lbs).</li>
  <li>First-Aid Kit (p. HT221) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: A <em>modern</em> first-aid kit. $50, 1kg (2
lbs).</li>
  <li>Group Basics (p. B288, see above) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: $50, 10kg (20 lbs).</li>
  <li>Pickaxe (p. B288) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: $15, 4kg (8 lbs).</li>
  <li>Pole, 3m (p. B288) <strong>[Torso]</strong>: $8, 2.5kg (5 lbs).</li>
  <li>Shovel, Titanium (p. HT26) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: $40, 2kg (4 lbs).</li>
  <li>Tent, Dome (p. HT57) <strong>[Backpack]</strong>: +2 to Survival. $150, 6kg.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Dragon Heresy Introductory Set</strong> is a book written by Douglas Cole and
published by his company, Gaming Ballistic LLC. Mr. Cole has long been a
freelancer for Steve Jackson Games, and he has to his name books such as GURPS
Martial Arts, GURPS Technical Grappling and several others. I’ve been following
his blog, also called Gaming Ballistic, for quite a while now.</p>

<p>The <strong>Introductory Set</strong> is the company’s latest offering, and it’s <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2101297466/the-dragon-heresy-introductory-set-fantasy-rpg">Kickstarter
campaign</a> is just wrapping up. As far as KS campaigns go, it was quite
successful: it got the money it needed, hit some cool stretch goals, and is set
to deliver on time. I expect the finished product will be availabe on the store
before the end of this month.</p>

<p>Having read my preliminary backer copy, I will endeavor to give you my
impressions of it.</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

<p><strong>Dragon Heresy</strong> might be the first iteration of D&amp;D Fifth Edition that doesn’t
put me to sleep. From now on, I will always be a bit sad when I play vanilla 5th
edition because I could be playing <strong>Dragon Heresy</strong> instead.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-book-itself">On the Book Itself</h2>

<p>The mostly-final PDF of <strong>The Dragon Heresy Introductory Set</strong> I have in front
of me is around 285 pages long - the final book will have 288, so this is just
missing the covers and perhaps a page or two of editorial information. People
who backed it at a higher level than I did will also get a luxurious hardcover
version (an offset print run was one of the stretch goals they achieved).</p>

<p>The book contains everything you need to play the game from levels 1 to 5, from
basic die-rolling concepts to character creation, rules for lots of common
situations and large catalogues of spells and monsters. You can see that all of
this was taken from the as-yet-unpublished full game, since there are hints
about higher-level stuff left here and there, but the text is
self-contained. The hints act mostly as teasers of what the future might bring.</p>

<p>Layout-wise, the text is reminiscent of the official D&amp;D books at a first look,
but all the graphical elements on the page are specific to Dragon Heresy. The
body font is a workable serif face, and the titles manage to be both
fancy-looking and readable. The art that is already there is quite good
overall. Several artists worked on this book, and their styles are usually
dissimilar enough to be noticeable, but not enough to make the book look
inconsistent.</p>

<p>The writing is generally clear, and occasionally sprinkled with the same
delightful bits of humor you can find in <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong> supplements,
which for me is always a plus.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, this thing has an table of contents and index comparable to
those of a GURPS book. This is high praise: no one, and I mean <em>no one</em> publishes
books that are as well-indexed as those of GURPS. The PDF also contains links in
its text, which further helps referencing related concepts.</p>

<h2 id="on-player-characters">On Player Characters</h2>

<p>Core mechanics and character creation options take up roughly the first 50 pages
of the book. The basic mechanics are what you’d expect from any SRD 5.1 game:
ability checks, advantage/disadvantage, and so on.</p>

<p>Character creation uses a set of three different number arrays. The player
chooses one and assigns the numbers to the character’s abilities. As the author
says, people who really want to roll 4d6-drop-lowest or even 3d6-in-order
already know how to do it by heart.</p>

<p>The available races are Humans, Dwarves, Dragonborn, Half-Elves and
Tieflings. None of them are what you’d expect from reading the names alone, and
all of them get a detailed overview of their culture. Humans are basically
ethnically diverse vikings. Dwarves look like they’re made of stone and have a
stronger bond to their craft guild than to their biological family. Dragonborn
can look like anything from humans with a bit of a skin condition to barely
humanoid lizard-people, and have a history as former slaves of the Elder
Dragons. Half-Elves and tieflings, in an interesting reversal of the cliche, are
generally <em>well-liked</em> by others wherever they go, having innate bonuses to
Charisma as they do.</p>

<p>You can’t play a full-blooded elf, because this is a Norse-inpired setting and
full-blooded Norse elves are scary.</p>

<p>Class-wise, you have the Berserker (a renamed Barbarian), the Skald (a renamed
Bard) plus Fighters, Clerics and Wizards. The basic rules for each are pretty
much the same as in standard D&amp;D, but their class options contain some
interesting novelty. Berserkers who don’t just want to rage harder at 3rd level
can choose to either channel rune magic or become monsters at
grappling. Fighters can get what I think might be the best Warlord-like
abilities I’ve ever seen in 5th edition material, and can start at first level
with a fighting style that makes them Valkyrie-good at spear-fighting. Skalds,
Clerics and Wizards also get their own flavorful options.</p>

<p>No rogues in this book, which is kind of appropriate as both the historical
Norse and the people of Torengar consider theft to be dishonorable. The
honorable thing to do is to <em>first</em> kill them, <em>then</em> take their stuff.</p>

<p>You also get a small selection of setting appropriate backgrounds, which segue
into an interesting set of rules for social standing. The more lavish your
lifestyle and the more expensive your bling, the more pull you have in Torengur
society.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-setting">On the Setting</h2>

<p><strong>Dragon Heresy</strong> has its own setting: the Norse-inspired kingdom of Torengar,
located in the world of Etera. The text takes pains to emphasize the <em>inspired</em>
bit, and that you shouldn’t expect the setting to rigorously match real
historical Norse facts, but you can still see that quite a bit of research went
into it.</p>

<p>The wider cosmology is based on Norse myth: you have Yggdrasil and its Nine
Realms, but there are several differences that are caused both by the need to
bring this a bit closer to a D&amp;D-ish arrangement and by the setting’s specific
history. The latter are the most interesting.</p>

<p>For example, Jotunheim is inhabited by <em>dragons</em>, not giants. Giants used to
live here at the beginning of time, but the dragons kicked them out. Alfheim was
similarly changed by ancient historical events. These details make me feel like
this is a post-Ragnarok world even though the Aesir are still kicking around.</p>

<p>The Aesir themselves are slightly changed from what you’d expect from reading up
on Norse myth. Of the “main cast”, Freya and Frigga have been mashed up into a
single deity (Valfreya), and several of the others go by names that as far as I
know are historical, but not as popular in the present-day real world. Woden,
Donnar, and such. There are also a whole bunch of other Aesir who don’t normally
get top billing in Marvel movies but which play an important part in the lives
of the people of Torengar.</p>

<p>The ancient history of Etera is dominated by a long war between the Winter Fae
and the Elder Dragons, which ended when a Fae faction performed a desperate
magical ritual of apocalyptic proportions that pretty much shattered both
empires and allowed their former slaves to spread out and form many smaller,
squabbling kingdoms. A few centuries ago, the dwarves of the island of Barakthel
began exerting their influence on the neighboring lands to make them a bit more
stable, resulting in the current political map.</p>

<p>Most Introductory Set adventures take place in Torengar, the most viking-like
kingdom of Etera, or in the neighboring land of Tanalor where most of the
ancient Fae and Dragon ruins are. There are other kingdoms that take more after
other real-world cultures and which the Torengur love to trade with and/or raid,
but they aren’t given much emphasis here. I imagine the full three-book set
would have more on them.</p>

<p>Overall the setting as presented in the Introductory Set is quite gameable, and
comes with plenty of advice and general hooks for creating adventures. It’s
certainly a lot more flavorful than the Forgotten Realms the official 5th
edition books stick to.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-new-mechanics">On the New Mechanics</h2>

<p>I’ve touched upon this a tiny bit when describing the character creation
options, but <strong>Dragon Heresy</strong> has a lot of new and interesting mechanics that,
in my eyes, turn D&amp;D 5th edition from the flavorless substrate of generic
fantasy roleplaying into something interesting in its own right.</p>

<p>The most obvious change is that it ditches Armor Class and Hit Points in favor
of a new Vigor/Wounds system. No, this isn’t the <em>first</em> wounds system in
roleplaying: Star Wars d20 tried something similar, and any Brazilian readers
will know Tagmar did it a decade before Star Wars d20. This is, however, one
of the <em>best-executed</em> wounds system I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>Your hit dice give you <em>Vigor</em> points, which explicitly represent your ability
to protect yourself from harm via weapon parries, shield blocks or plain
dodging. You gain more Vigor when you level up, and recover lost Vigor by
resting (much like HP in vanilla D&amp;D). You don’t take Vigor damage - you <em>spend</em>
vigor to avoid taking <em>Wounds</em>. Wounds are serious business. They take days or
weeks to heal without magic, and taking Wounds can seriously impair your
character long before they’re at death’s door.</p>

<p>Instead of a single Armor Class value, characters have a relatively low Threat
DC and a higher Hit DC. If an enemy beats your Threat DC, it means they will hit
you <em>unless</em> you actively defend yourself by spending Vigor. Beating your Hit DC
means they bypassed all of your defenses. Avoiding injury from that takes a
“frantic defense”, which among other things costs your reaction for the round.</p>

<p>Armor no longer makes you harder to hit - instead, it provides damage resistance
that reduces the amount of Wounds (<em>not</em> Vigor) you take from an attack. Shields
<em>do</em> make you harder to hit, and you need a shield to be able to defend yourself
normally from arrow fire or certain similar spells.</p>

<p>On top of this there’s grappling. <strong>Dragon Heresy</strong> uses a version of the
grappling system introduced in <strong>Dungeon Grappling</strong>, where attempts to grapple
an enemy cause Control Damage and enemies are more impaired the more Control has
been applied to them. You can also turn control directly into wounds, which
isn’t as efficient as just stabbing your enemy but is better than trying to
punch them barehanded.</p>

<p>I quite like these systems! You can kinda see the influence from GURPS here -
spending Vigor is the equivalent of making active defense rolls, and Dungeon
Grappling was of course inspired by Technical Grappling. These rules do a good
job of putting the age-old “hit points versus meat points” debate to rest.</p>

<p>Aside from these combat mechanics, there are other interesting additions. The
social standing system was already discussed earlier, and there is also a simple
system for Flyting, which is a ritualized contest of insults that was practiced
by Norse. Yes, apparently social combat was a thing in the real world.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you have any interest at all in the mechanic changes I summarized above, then
you should definitely get this book. This goes double if you like vikings! This
is only an introductory set, but the new mechanics and the setting could easily
be transplanted into a game based on the vanilla SRD. The only thing you’d be
missing are the new character options beyond level 5.</p>

<p>Like millions of people worldwide, I’ve been playing Assassin’s Creed games for
a long time. One of the big draws of the games is all the cool gear you get to
use, and I often bounce a few ideas around the inside of my skull about how this
stuff would look on the tabletop. This is my first attempt at actually writing
it down. In this post in particular we’ll look at the equipment used by Altaïr
in the original Assassin’s Creed, using GURPS stats.</p>

<p>There’s one obvious Cool Gadget here, and we’ll get to it eventually, but the
rest of the equipment is surprisingly mundane considering the crazy stuff that
appears in later games.</p>

<h2 id="clothing-and-armor">Clothing And Armor</h2>

<p>Altaïr and the rest of the Assassins don’t seem to wear too much in
terms of armor, which makes sense since they’re portrayed as valuing stealth and
mobility. Armor is a mainstay for the opposition in this game, and it seems to
be portrayed in a historically accurate manner: check out GURPS Loadouts:
Low-Tech Armor p. 27-29 for a very detailed breakdown. In short, both the
Templars and Sarracens tend to wear DR 3 or 4 mail, with metal helmets.</p>

<p>The infamous hooded outfit (AKA the Menacing Hood) is probably not very
historical, since looking cool was a greater priority in its design than being
period-appropriate. There’s a million jokes out there about how absurd it is
that Altaïr can hide amidst the crowd at all while basically dressed as Medieval
Batman, but that’s clearly something the Assassins are supposed to be able to do
in-setting.</p>

<p>It would make sense for Assassin characters in a tabletop game to wear
<em>Undercover Clothing</em> (Low-Tech, p. 100). Altaïr’s iconic outfit isn’t quite
bulky enough to count as a Long Coat (Low-Tech, p. 99), but wearing one in
addition to the undercover clothes would definitely make sense for PC
Assassins. The total +5 or +6 bonus to Holdout would make hiding all those
weapons much easier!</p>

<h2 id="weapons">Weapons</h2>

<p>Assassin’s mostly fight with period-appropriate weapons. All the one-handed
swords seen in the game would use the stats for a broadsword (and the Broadsword
skill). Altaïr also gets access to a Long Knife, and to Small Throwing
Knives. The opposition uses the same sort of sword. Those enemies posted as
rooftop guards tend to carry Light Crossbows as well. You can find stats for
these and many other suitable TL 2-3 weapons in the Basic Set, Low-Tech, or
Martial Arts.</p>

<p>But that’s not what you’re here for, is it?</p>

<h3 id="the-hidden-blade">The Hidden Blade</h3>

<p>This marvel of Fantasy Tech-style engineering is a pure assassination weapon
unsuited to open combat. It consists of a leather and metal bracer with a
built-in, retractable knife blade. The spring-loaded mechanism is controlled by
a ring around the hand’s little finger, and the blade is concealed along the
underside of the arm. The model used in the original game can only be used by
someone who had amputated the ring finger on the corresponding hand.</p>

<p>The bracer is mostly leather covered with light metal plates that give DR 3 to
that forearm. While the blade is retracted, the user has a +5 bonus to Holdout
to conceal its nature as a weapon unless the people doing the searching know
exactly what to look for. Extending the blade usually takes a Ready action, but
the user can make a Fast-Draw (Knife) roll to do it instantly. Retracting the
blade is a free action: just relax your hand!</p>

<p>Stabbing with the Hidden Blade uses the Knife skill. It cannot parry, and counts
as Cheap quality for other breakage purposes. It’s different enough from a plain
old knife to inflict a -2 unfamiliarity penalty to both Knife and Fast-Draw on
users who haven’t trained with it before. Such a newbie would also probably lose
their ring finger the first time they extended the blade!</p>
