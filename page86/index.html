<p>Tieflings rose to prominence during 2e, and were added as a playable option
right in the Fourth Edition PHB, though they’re a little different from their
previous incarnations here. As opposition, they’re featured in both the Monster
Manual and the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in other entries, Nerath is only the latest empire to fall in the
long story of the 4e setting. One of the many others that preceded it was the
human empire of Bael Turath, which fought for supremacy with the dragonborn
realm of Arkhosia a long time ago.</p>

<p>There came a time when Bael Turath was engulfed in turmoil, both because of that
war and because of its own decadence. In a desperate bid to retain control, its
leadership made sinister pacts with the forces of Hell. This worked for a time,
but it only delayed the final fall of the empire. Things turn ugly when both the
human nobles and the devils tried to break their side of the bargain. In the
end, both Bael Turath and Arkhosia met their end.</p>

<p>One of the effects of that diabolic compact was that the humans of Bael Turath
had their bodies infused with infernal power, transforming them into the
tieflings we know today. This transformation is hereditary and it persisted even
after the compact was broken and the empire fell. Today tiefling communities are
spread all over the world, either mixed in with larger multi-species settlements
or in small enclaves of their own, similar to dragonborn.</p>

<p>In addition to their distinctive looks, they retain a tiny bit of infernal
power. Both these things give them a bad reputation among other sapients, but
the truth is that modern tieflings are no more disposed to evil than any other
people. A tiefling could be a great champion of good just as they could choose
to embrace their bad rep and become evil diabolists.</p>

<p>Tiefling looks are a lot more uniform here than they used to be in previous
editions: red skin, prominent horns, solid red orbs for eyes, and a thick
muscular tail. They look like a less extreme version of a legion devil (which is
hairless with clawed hands and hooves for feet in addition to the other traits).</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Tieflings are Medium Natural Humanoids, and all of them have low-light vision
and some degree of fire resistance. The MM stat blocks also have the same
<strong>Infernal Wrath</strong> power tiefling PCs get. This is a minor action encounter
power that gives them a +1 attack bonus and a damage bonus against someone who
just hit them. It’s a “revenge” booster, essentially. Like PCs, they also get +1
to hit bloodied targets.</p>

<p>Each book gives us two tiefling stat blocks. As is the case for all playable
humanoids, they can be of any alignment and could be used as allies or
enemies. However, all of them seem to lean into their infernal heritage at least
a bit, so even the good ones will have the same air of ambiguity around them as
the party’s infernal warlock.</p>

<h3 id="tiefling-fury-monster-vault">Tiefling Fury (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>This is a duelist type, and a Level 5 Soldier with 63 HP. Its speed is 6, and it
has all common tiefling traits with 10 fire resistance.</p>

<p>The fury fights with a <strong>longsword</strong> whose attacks mark for a turn, and if a
marked enemy shift it can use a <strong>Tail Trip</strong> (melee 1 vs. Reflex) as an
interrupt to knock them prone and make a free longsword attack against them. If
an enemy hits the fury, it can use a <strong>Defiant Curse</strong> as a free action to mark
them for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="tiefling-heretic-monster-manual">Tiefling Heretic (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>An infernal warlock. It’s Level 6 Artillery with 60 HP, all common MM traits,
and a fire resistance of 11.</p>

<p>The heretic fights with a <strong>dagger</strong> in melee, and with bolts of <strong>Balefire</strong> at
range that deal immediate and ongoing fire damage (save ends). Once per
encounter it can conjure a <strong>Serpent Curse</strong> on a target (ranged 10 vs. will),
causing illusory snakes to appear and deal both immediate and ongoing psychic
damage.</p>

<p>When hit by a melee attack, the heretic can use <strong>Cloak of Escape</strong> as an
at-will reaction to teleport 5 squares. It also has <strong>Infernal Wrath</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="tiefling-darkblade-monster-manual">Tiefling Darkblade (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>An assassin-type, and a Level 7 Lurker with 64 HP and fire
resistance 12. Darkblades fight with <strong>poisoned shortswords</strong> that allow a
secondary attack against Fortitude on a hit, doing ongoing poison damage (save
ends). They can use <strong>Cloak of Lurking</strong> (move action; recharge 6) to teleport 5
squares and become invisible.</p>

<p>It seems they don’t have any powers that allow them to do increased damage when
attacking from hiding or with CA, so they’re in effect slightly weaker
skirmishers.</p>

<h3 id="tiefling-occultist-monster-vault">Tiefling Occultist (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>Another infernal warlock! This one is a Level 8 Controller with 87 HP and fire
resistance 10.</p>

<p>Occultists fight in melee with a <strong>Hell Rod</strong> that does immediate and ongoing
fire damage (save ends). They attack at range with <strong>Soul Fire</strong> (area burst 1
within 10 vs. Reflex), which does no immediate damage. Instead it does 10
ongoing fire damage (save ends), and deals 10 psychic damage to the target if it
moves closer to the occultist on the target’s next action.</p>

<p>As a move action it can use <strong>Baleful Teleport</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will) to
teleport a target 10 squares and teleport itself to the square the target just
left.</p>

<p>If an enemy hits the occultist, it can use <strong>Fiery Transposition</strong> to deal 5
fire damage to all enemies in a close burst 3, and swap places with the enemy
that hit it.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters And Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter goes all in on the hellish imagery: 1 heretic, 1 darkblade,
2 cambion hellswords, and a succubus.</p>

<p>I like tieflings, though more as a playable race than as an enemy. The enemy
stat blocks work well enough, however, and could also represent human warlocks
or other similar baddies.</p>

<p>Treants are inspired by Tolkien’s ents and have been in the game since at least
the days of BECMI, and likely earlier. Here, they are both in the Monster Manual
and in the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Treants are indeed very similar to the ents we see in The Lord of the Rings:
they’re sapient tree-like creatures who live in primeval forests. The main
difference between them (especially in 4e) is that treants are a lot quicker to
arrive at decisions, and a lot angrier with trespassers.</p>

<p>Treants love the forests where they live, and act as their guardians. They
spend much of their extremely long lives in a dormant/meditative state in which
they’re pretty much indistinguishable from normal trees. In this state, they can
feel the general state of the surrounding forest and its creatures, and know
when it’s in distress. When that happens, they rise to defend it.</p>

<p>Though treants love their forest and its creatures, they hold no particular
regard for any outsiders. They’ll be friendly towards those who demonstrate the
proper respect for the wild, and violent towards anyone who has the temerity to
chop down trees or otherwise despoil their territory.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault goes a little further here, saying that treants view
civilization in much the same way “civilized” people view the untamed wild: a
source of danger best removed. Their prefer nature in its wildest and most
unspoiled state, and will work to protect their territories even from natural
disasters like floods or fires caused by lightning. They’ll ally with anyone who
shares their values and opposes their enemies. They’re also very easy to anger
(particularly when they feel they’ve been betrayed) and very hard to placate.</p>

<p>A treant’s most frequent allies are dryads, who share their general
disposition. Eladrin and other fey are often allies as well, though in this case
both sides tend to view each other more warily. You could even have a treant
protecting the lair of an orc tribe, as long as the orcs focus their destruction
outside of the treant’s domain.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Treants are Huge Fey Magical Beasts with the Plant keyword. They have low-light
vision, Forest Walk, and a <strong>Wooden Body</strong> trait that makes them take ongoing 5
fire damage (save ends) whenever an attack deals immediate fire damage to
them. The trait only gets a name in the Monster Vault, but is also present in
the MM versions. If the attack in question already does ongoing fire damage, I
guess this trait doesn’t stack with it.</p>

<p>Treants fight using a combination of their great strength with primal magic that
grants them a measure of control over their surroundings. They’re fairly smart
at Int 14, and though grumpy and aggressive they’re Unaligned.</p>

<h3 id="bramblewood-treant-monster-vault">Bramblewood Treant (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>Unlike the other treants, this one is “only” Large. It could be a younger
specimen, or a different species that inhabits forests with smaller trees. It’s
a Level 10 Soldier with 108 HP and all common treant traits. It has speed 8 and
a <strong>Bramble Branches</strong> aura (2) that turns the covered area into difficult
terrain.</p>

<p>The bramblewood treant attacks with Reach 2 <strong>slams</strong> that mark the target for a
turn, and can throw <strong>stones</strong> (Ranged 20 vs. AC) for some ranged damage. If an
enemy within 2 squares moves, the treant can use <strong>Entangling Branches</strong> (melee
2 vs. Reflex) as an interrupt and grab them with an escape DC of 18.</p>

<p>This treant is at the right level to pal around with most dryads, some of the
eladrin, or the banshrae.</p>

<h3 id="treant-both">Treant (Both)</h3>

<p>The basic model is Huge, and a Level 16 Elite Controller with 316 HP and all
common traits. Its land speed is 8, and it projects a <strong>Grasping Roots</strong> aura
(3) that makes the covered area difficult terrain for nonflying enemies.</p>

<p>It fights with powerful <strong>slams</strong>, and can use an <strong>Earthshaking Stomp</strong> (close
burst 2 vs. Fortitude) to do a bunch of damage and knock enemies prone. In the
Monster Manual this is an encounter power, and in the Monster Vault it recharges
if the attack misses every target.</p>

<p>The treant’s other trick is <strong>Awaken Forest</strong> (area burst 3 within 10 vs. AC),
which causes the vegetation in the area (trees included) to animate and attack
enemies within. In the MM this is an encounter power that creates a zone which
can be sustained with minor actions, and which makes new attacks against enemies
inside whenever the treant sustains it.</p>

<p>In the MV, it’s a simple at-will standard action attack, and it creates a zone
of difficult terrain that lasts either until the end of the encounter, or until
the treant uses this power again.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault version of the treant is by far the better one, since it has
updated damage values and is also a better controller. Other than “use fire”,
there isn’t much you can do to get the upper hand over it, since it can make
solid attacks and impair movement both in melee and at range. Treants pair
really well with other creatures that have the Forest Walk ability.</p>

<h3 id="treant-grove-guardian-monster-vault">Treant Grove Guardian (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>I guess this is the sort of creature you can find guarding a powerful druid’s
home base. It’s a Level 18 Brute with 212 HP and all common treant traits. Its
speed is 8.</p>

<p>Grove guardians are all about physical combat. Their basic attack is a Reach 3
<strong>Sweeping Slam</strong> that can target one or two creatures, damaging and knocking
them prone on a hit. Once per encounter they can perform a maneuver called
<strong>Stump Stomp</strong>, in which they move their speed, can enter other creature’s
spaces, and make a sweeping slam attack against each creature whose space they
enter.</p>

<h3 id="blackroot-treant-both">Blackroot Treant (Both)</h3>

<p>This is an <em>undead</em> treant. You know those haunted forests where the trees seem
to have evil faces? These guys are those trees. Unlike living treants they’re
actively Evil, and actually a bit smarter at Int 16.</p>

<p>Blackroot treants are Huge Level 19 Elite Soldiers with 368 HP and all common
treant traits. They have Speed 6 and the Undead keyword in addition to being
Plants. They project a <strong>Killing Roots</strong> aura (2) which does 10 necrotic damage
to enemies caught inside.</p>

<p>Their Reach 3 <strong>slams</strong> also do ongoing necrotic damage (save ends), and mark the target
for a turn. They have <strong>Double Attack</strong>, and so can use two of those per
action. As a minor action they can use <strong>Entangling Roots</strong> (melee 4 vs. Reflex)
to knock someone prone and restrain them.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual version is a less powerful, since it lacks Double Attack, its
slams don’t mark, and the effect of Entangling Roots ceases if the treant gets
more than 4 squares away from the target. Always use the MV version if
possible. Used well, they can keep most of the party locked down tight, since
they can use Entangling Roots 1-3 times per turn and have no limit to the number
of people they can keep restrained.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h3>

<p>The MM sample encounter is level 19 and all about that haunted forest vibe: 1
blackroot treant, 2 slaughter wights, and 2 sword wraiths.</p>

<p>I like treants, even though this iteration of them is a bit more aggressive than
I would like. Mechanically speaking, the MV versions are clearly superior to the
MM originals, and you should use them whenever possible.</p>

<p>Swordwings are a 4e original, I believe. They’re only on the Monster Manual,
though I think they get some extra lore in a Dragon article.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Swordwings are a species of humanoid arthropod who lives in the deep
Underdark. Their name comes from their wings and from the fact that one of their
arms is shaped like a sword and can be used as such. They’re sapient, and their
alien culture is focused on building and displaying collections. Of what? It
varies!</p>

<p>Every individual swordwing has its own preferences. Some are specialized in a
single type of object, while others are more eclectic and keep several different
collections. The book says typical examples are collections of skulls, weapons,
gems, magic items, eggs, or victims’ hearts. A swordwing’s collection is what
defines it as an individual, and I guess the quality of that collection might
also act as a measure of status in their society. This implies that every
swordwing is a connoisseur and an expert curator in its chosen field.</p>

<p>Swordwings build nesting spires using the same biological processes a wasp would
use: chew the surrounding material and transform it into a paper-like substance,
which gets molded into the final structure. Each home in these spires is a small
museum of its inhabitant’s collection.</p>

<p>These creatures fly out of their nests in groups to find more items suitable for
display, and as you might expect they don’t much care for the feelings of those
items’ current owners. Sometimes, they’ll ally with other denizens of the Deep
Underdark who don’t own anything they collect but can help them increase their
hoards in exchange for certain favors.</p>

<p>As I remember, these monsters were responsible for starting one of the battles
in the Edition War, since they were showcased in an article as an example of the
sort of all-new monster you would see in the new edition to better support epic
play. Detractors complained a lot about how swordwings made no sense because any
world where these things lived would end in short order.</p>

<p>To a point, that’s true - any epic monster that gets loose in the sort of
setting one imagines for a low-level game can theoretically turn into an
unstoppable, apocalyptic menace. However, this is supposed to be the game whose
settings have a place for epic creatures. And for Swordwings, that’s the deep
Underdark, where they get to pal around with eye tyrants, gibbering orbs, and
alien gods from the Far Realm. Preventing these fine folks from invading the
surface is the type of thing an epic campaign is supposed to be about.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Swordwings are Aberrant Humanoids, and prove that the Aberrant origin isn’t
<em>always</em> about tentacles. Sometimes it’s about sword arms!</p>

<p>Swordwings are Evil and communicate using Deep Speech. They have a ground speed
of 6 and a dragonfly-like air speed of 10 with Hover. They have low-light
vision, and their main attack is of course the <strong>armblade</strong>, tough different
stat blocks do different things with it. There’s two of those.</p>

<h3 id="swordwing">Swordwing</h3>

<p>The basic model is Medium, and a Level 25 Soldier with 234 HP. Its <strong>armblade</strong>
is a Reach 2 high-crit weapon and gains a +2 to attack bloodied targets. It also
marks the target for a turn, and benefits from a couple of passive traits that
increase its damage in certain situations.</p>

<p>One of them is <strong>Sudden Strike</strong>, which allows the swordwing to attack an
adjacent enemy that shifts as an interrupt, with a damage bonus. Thanks to
<strong>Vicious Opportunist</strong>, the swordwing also gains the same damage bonus on
opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>These critters are awesome at fighting in a square formation two bugs deep,
where both rows can attack. They’re also good in a wedge formation, since
they’re so effective at punishing enemies who try to slide around them. Both of
these are better in tight quarters - wide open spaces might make then
susceptible to ranged attacks, though they can close the gap really fast.</p>

<p>Give them some artillery and controller allies who can stand behind that tight
formation, and the PCs should sweat a bit. If the heroes have lots of area
attacks at their disposal, basic swordwings are also really effective in a
looser skirmish formation, since each individual can exert some control over its
immediate area.</p>

<h3 id="crownwing">Crownwing</h3>

<p>This Large specimen is likely a high-status individual. It could be because of
simple genetics, though I think it’s more interesting if they mutate as their
collections grow fancier and more prestigious. Their average Int is 18 instead
of the basic model’s 10, and they have more skill training. It’s plausible they
know and can use magic rituals.</p>

<p>Crownwings are Level 26 Skirmishers with the Leader tag and 238 HP. Their
<strong>armblade</strong> is still a Reach 2 high-crit weapon, and this time it does bonus
damage against flanked targets. They can make the standard <strong>Flyby Attack</strong>
maneuver where they fly their speed without drawing opportunity attacks and make
an armblade strike at any point.</p>

<p>Their leadery skill is the <strong>Mark of Death</strong> (ranged 10, encounter), which
always hits and grants allies a +2 to attack and +10 to damage against the
target. This lasts until the end of the fight, which suits an encounter power.</p>

<p>Crownwings are a perfect complement for a troop of basic swordwings, and they
also work really well in command of a gaggle of minions, who suddenly become a
lot more dangerous against a PC afflicted by the Mark of Death. Multiple
crownwings can mark multiple PCs and switch targets so they’re always hitting
someone who gives them a damage bonus. Smart PCs should try pin these things
down ASAP, and either attack from range or keep switching back to avoid the
bonus.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s two sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 25:  4 swordwings and 1 crownwing. Your basic patrol or raiding squad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 29: 3 swordwings and a gibbering orb. Boss-and-bodyguards, with the
guards acting as a nice force multiplier.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It might be my bias towards 4e speaking, but I really like swordwings. They
fulfill a needed role of “high-level regulars”, and their collecting obsession
makes them more than just “Orcs, but Epic”. It also helps that they can fly.</p>

<p>Spiders have been in the game since the beginning. Here, they’re present in both
the Monster Manual and in the Monster Vault’s animal appendix.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>While some real-world spiders can have a pretty dangerous bite, they’re not
really suitable as a combat encounter. The books concern themselves with
monstrous giant spiders instead.</p>

<p>There are many species of monstrous spider in D&amp;D and they’re
everywhere. Deserts, forests, caverns (“surface” or Underdark), ruins, anywhere
a tiny spider would like can be home to a monstrous variety as well. The vast
majority of them are simply natural creatures, but some are the blessed of
Lolth and enjoy her divine gifts.</p>

<p>Predictably, drow love spiders and frequently train them or control them through
magic to serve in all the same capacities someone on the surface would use a
dog, horse, or drake for. Kobolds and goblins might also employ them if they’re
part of the locally available fauna.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>All spiders shown here, with one exception, are Natural Beasts with the Spider
keyword. That keyword is important because, among other things, drow tend to
have lots of powers that buff spider allies.</p>

<p>The individual stat blocks vary a lot, but all have some level of Tremorsense,
and a climb speed equal to their ground speed with the Spider Climb tag
(obviously). Their basic attack is always a <strong>bite</strong> and almost always has some
sort of venom effect associated with it.</p>

<p>All of the Monster Vault spiders have <strong>Web Walk</strong>, which allows them to ignore
web-based difficult terrain. While this isn’t explicitly listed in the Monster
Manual entries it would be fair to assume all of them have it too.</p>

<h3 id="spider-swarm-mv">Spider Swarm (MV)</h3>

<p>The least monstrous of the bunch, this is a lot of normal-sized aggressive
spiders acting as a swarm monster. The swarm is a Level 3 Soldier with 44 HP,
tremorsense 5 and a speed of 6, along with the usual swarm resistances and
vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura (1) slows enemies caught inside instead of granting
extra attacks. They attack with a <strong>Swarm of Fangs</strong> that targets Reflex because
they get inside your armor. It has an ongoing poison damage rider (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="deathjump-spider-both">Deathjump Spider (Both)</h3>

<p>These Medium spiders are Level 4 Skirmishers with 55 HP. They have tremorsense
5, resist poison 5, and a speed of 6. Though they have Web Walk, they’re not big
spinners themselves, and hunt by jumping on their prey.</p>

<p>The stats for the spider’s bite are a bit wonky in the MM version: compared to
what the updated math says, their attacks are woefully inaccurate and abnormally
strong. The MV version fixes this. In both cases, the rider is ongoing poison
damage (save ends).</p>

<p>The deathjump spider’s special attack is <strong>Death From Above</strong>, in which the
spider shifts up to 6 squares by jumping and makes a bite attack at the end. If
that hits, the target is also knocked prone. The MM version also does increased
base damage.</p>

<p>It can also make a <strong>Prodigious Leap</strong> as a move-action encounter power, which
allows it to shift 10 squares. So this spider could initiate combat by jumping
at the party’s wizard from a full 16 squares away!</p>

<p>The MM gives it another trait, <strong>Soft Fall</strong>, allowing it to ignore the first 30
feet of height of any fall. This is absent from the MV version, probably because
they thought it was a bit too finicky.</p>

<h3 id="bloodweb-spider-swarm">Bloodweb Spider Swarm</h3>

<p>A more powerful version of the MV swarm, these spiders have been brought
together and are controlled by magic. Without orders, they’ll default to
attacking the nearest living creature until it dies before moving on to the next
victim.</p>

<p>This swarm counts as a Level 7 Soldier with 80 HP. It otherwise works just like
the level 3 swarm, except that it’s slower at speed 4 and its aura <em>does</em> grant
free basic attacks.</p>

<h3 id="doomspinner-spider-mv">Doomspinner Spider (MV)</h3>

<p>This chunky Large spider does spin elaborate webs to catch prey with. It’s a
Level 7 Controller with 82 HP, Tremorsense 10, Resist Poison 5, and speed 6.</p>

<p>Their bite also has an ongoing poison damage rider, which increases if the
target of the bite is restrained, immobilized, stunned, or unconscious. Its
special attack is <strong>Web Casting</strong> (area burst 1 within 5 vs. Reflex), which does
no damage but restrains everyone it hits. The area of the burst becomes
difficult terrain until the end of the encounter.</p>

<p>As a minor action the doomspinner can also shoot a strand of webbing at someone,
in an attack named <strong>Drawn to Doom</strong> (Ranged 5 vs. Fortitude), which does no
damage but pulls the target 4 squares.</p>

<p>Though doomspinners can restrain enemies by themselves, they also pair really
well with other monsters that can inflict the conditions that increase the
effectiveness of their venom. “Multiple doomspinners” is the obvious setup, but
there are plenty of other options.</p>

<h3 id="blade-spider-mm">Blade Spider (MM)</h3>

<p>These Large spiders have two blade-like front legs, and attack with them instead
of biting. They live in the Underdark and are popular drow pets, having the
Mount keyword.</p>

<p>Blade spiders are Level 10 Brutes with 130 HP, tremorsense 10, and
speed 6. Unlike most of their relatives, they have no resistance to
poison. Their basic attack is a <strong>Claw</strong> with a rider that does ongoing poison
damage and weakens (save ends both). They can make <strong>double attacks</strong> with that.</p>

<p>When used as mounts, they can make <strong>combined attacks</strong>, which means they attack
with a claw as a free action when their rider makes an attack.</p>

<h3 id="cave-spider-mv">Cave Spider (MV)</h3>

<p>These Medium spiders likely behave as a scaled-up swarm, with their size and
numbers being such that you can track them individually. They’re level 12 Minion
Skirmishers with tremorsense 5, resist poison 10 and speed 6.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> does the usual fixed minion damage, with additional poison damage
on top if the target is immobilized, restrained, stunned or unconscious. They
can also use a <strong>Tethering Web</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Reflex) as a minor action to
immobilize someone for a turn.</p>

<p>Combine a small horde of these with a leveled-up doomspinner or three, and your
PCs are going to have a bad time.</p>

<h3 id="demonweb-terror-mm">Demonweb Terror (MM)</h3>

<p>Native to the Demonweb Pits, these are the true blessed of Lolth. They’re Huge
Elemental Beasts with the Spider keyword. All the other spiders in this entry
are simple Unaligned animals with Int 1, but terrors have Int 8 and are Chaotic
Evil. You can try to talk to them if you know Abyssal, but that will do you no
good.</p>

<p>Demonweb Terrors are Level 14 Elite Controllers with 296 HP, tremorsense 10, and
a speed of 6. Interestingly, they have no poison resistance, though perhaps they
should.</p>

<p>Their bite carries a venom that does ongoing poison damage and slows (save
ends). As a 1/round minor action they can shoot a <strong>web</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Reflex)
that does no damage and immobilizes (save ends). After they’re first bloodied,
they can use the <strong>Poison Spray</strong> encounter power (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude)
that has the same effects as the bite’s rider over the whole area.</p>

<p>These feel a tiny bit underpowered - they were likely only made Elite to pad out
their HP. However, they likely work well when accompanied by other monsters who
can capitalize on the immobilization and slowness they inflict.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The MM gives us 2 sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11: 2 blade spiders, 2 bloodweb spider swarms, 1 drow blademaster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 1 demonweb terror, 1 drow arachnomancer, 2 drider fanglords and 3
drow warriors.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, the book goes all-in on the whole Lolth connection. Any
encounter with drow is likely to involve spiders. And while the lower-level
spiders will likely be found as dungeon wildlife, the more powerful ones will
very often be accompanied by drow as well.</p>

<p>I think giant spiders are a classic dungeon denizen, and work well when used in
moderation. Of course, drow are known for despising the concept of moderation
when it comes to arachnids.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/01/01/mecha.html">Are Mecha Silly?</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Recently I saw someone start a thread on the RPG.net forum, with the title “Why
are mecha silly?”. The person in question was of the opinion that not only were
mecha not silly, they were <em>plausible</em>, and went on to list reasons they thought
so.</p>

<p>Of course, all of those were swiftly debunked by posters, but I think the thread
kinda got away from the main point after a while. So I thought I’d write a bit
about this subject here.</p>

<p>The thread’s title had a bit of an unfortunate framing, because it started from
the premise that mecha <em>are</em> silly even though its opening poster didn’t think
so. A better question to ask might be “Are Mecha Silly?”</p>

<p>My answer is somewhat nuanced, but it can still be summed up as “No”. Giant
robots are definitely <em>cinematic</em>, but they’re not inherently sillier than any
other cinematic trope. It’s all about the context.</p>

<p>I’m using “mech” and “mecha” here to mean a humanoid (or at least legged)
piloted machine that’s used in about the same role as an armored fighting
vehicle or tank. Non-combat versions are usually used as heavy construction
equipment.</p>

<p>These are some of the traditional excuses for mecha: Legs make them able to
handle any terrain type better than wheels or threads. A humanoid form makes
them more agile and versatile than traditional vehicles. Something about the
specific technology used to build them makes them better weapons than
traditional vehicles (this last one varies per setting).</p>

<p>None of these would hold up under scrutiny under a strictly realistic
setting. While some people are building smaller autonomous robots and
experimenting with load-bearing skeletons, building a giant mech is still far
beyond us and the general consensus on that seems to be that it’s not worth the
effort. Better to work at improving the specialized vehicles we know than
worrying about leg movement and the ground pressure exerted by two giant metal
feet.</p>

<p>As you get more cinematic mecha become a better fit. An “action movie setting”
that makes you accept some people do the impossible because they’re just that
badass shouldn’t have a lot of trouble selling the idea that sometimes tanks
have legs. Full Metal Panic in its more serious moments is a good example of
this. The show itself is silly most of the time, but the robot fights are trated
in a more serious cinematic manner.</p>

<p>Science fictional settings have more leeway than contemporary ones, because the
same classical excuses are still valid and it’s easier to assume that the
practical engineering concerns have been solved in the future. A lot of the
Gundam shows are in this territory, as are many other similar franchises.</p>

<p>And that’s just the shows that even bother to offer up excuses! You see, there
are two main “sub-genres” of mecha shows. The ones that bother to think about
excuses and to insert their mecha into a wider military context are called “Real
Robot” shows. The original Mobile Suit Gundam back in 1979 was the first of
these.</p>

<p>The other side of the coin are “Super Robot” shows, who don’t even bother with
that. Sometimes a 12-year old kid just inherits a fifteen story tall robot from
his dad, and flies that robot out of the secret hangar at the bottom of his
swimming pool to fight space monsters. Super Robot shows date from the early
seventies, and their overall aesthetic is closer to that of a gold or silver age
supers story than “proper” science fiction. They require the same kind of
suspension of disbelief. If you can accept Superman, you can accept Mazinger Z.</p>

<p>Whether Real or Super, no type of mecha is inherently silly as long as you place
it in the type of story it was meant to go in. Just like any other cinematic
trope.</p>
