<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Like other goblinoids, hobs have been in D&amp;D since the beginning, where they
used to fit right above Orcs in the Humanoid Power Ladder. Having 1+1 HD
prevented them from being casually cleaved by OD&amp;D fighters.</p>

<p>In 4e, as I’ve already discussed, they’re the most disciplined and militaristic
of goblinoids, and likely to be in charge in any situation where the three types
are working together. They produce their fair share of empire-building
commanders, and can also be found working as mercenaries for any number of
clients. Their discipline makes them the most reliable goblinoid mercenaries
money can buy.</p>

<p>Once again we have seven hobgoblin stat blocks in the MM and four in the
MV. Let’s look at them by order of level.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Hobgoblins are some of the monsters that changed the most between books, and
this includes their standard traits. Both versions have Speed 6 and low-light
vision, but the signature powers are pretty different.</p>

<p>Monster Manual hobgoblins have two such traits: Hobgoblin Resilience is a
reaction that allows them to immediately make a save when hit by an effect a
save can end. And Phalanx Soldier is a passive trait that gives them a +2 bonus
to AC when adjacent to at least one other hobgoblin. All hobs have the first,
and only warrior-types have the second.</p>

<p>You can probably see the problem here - these two traits make hobgoblins a lot
harder to kill than their level would indicate. A fight against hobgoblins could
drag on for a long time, particularly when the players are still inexperienced.</p>

<p>The signature trait for Monster Vault hobgoblins is Phalanx Movement, a move
action that allows both the user and each ally in a Close Burst 1 to shift 1
square, as long as they all end up adjacent to each other. This allows a group
of hobgoblins to slowly advance as a unit, with no gaps in their
formation. Hobgoblin Resilience still makes an appearance in the MV stat blocks,
but only once.</p>

<h3 id="hobgoblin-grunt-mm">Hobgoblin Grunt (MM)</h3>

<p>The rank and file of a hobgoblin army, these are Level 3 Skirmisher
minions. They wear leather and wield a light shield and a longsword. They have
Hobgoblin Resilience and Phalanx Soldier, but no other special tricks.</p>

<p>There’s also a Hobgoblin Warrior that’s identical to the grunt, but is level 8.</p>

<h3 id="hobgoblin-archer-mm">Hobgoblin Archer (MM)</h3>

<p>These are Level 3 Artillery with 39 HP. They have Hobgoblin Resilience, but no
formation-related traits. Their gear is similar to the grunt’s with the addition
of a longbow and quiver of arrows.</p>

<p>Their longsword attacks are nothing special; longbow attacks grant an ally
within 5 squares of the target a +2 bonus to hit it on their next attack. The
little “tactics” paragraph for archers says they have a Coordinated Fire trait,
but that’s absent from the actual stat block. Not sure if it was ever added on
errata or not.</p>

<p>Still, they do very well as support for melee combatants in addition to being a
source of ranged damage themselves. With “coordinated fire” not being a thing,
you should spread your archers out in a loose skirmish line beyond the reach of
melee PCs.</p>

<h3 id="hobgoblin-soldier-mm">Hobgoblin Soldier (MM)</h3>

<p>Hobgoblin Soldiers are Level 3 Soldiers with 47 HP, and a very good case study
of how Hobgoblin Resilience and Phalanx Soldier together can be frustrating.</p>

<p>Being soldiers, their AC is already higher than normal - in fact, at 20, it’s 1
point higher than the new math says it should be. Phalanx Soldier gives then
another +2 on top of that when you have multiple adjacent hobgoblins (which you
will <em>always</em> have). They’ll also outright ignore about half of the effects
that require saves that are thrown their way.</p>

<p>They will usually be facing level 1-3 PCs, which will likely not be able to
throw multiple save effects per round to overcome their resilience. And they’ll
be as hard to hit with AC attacks as level 6 soldiers until there is one lone
hobgoblin left. The party is in for a long fight.</p>

<p>Offensively, hob soldiers fight with flails. Their basic attack both marks and
slows for a turn, and they can also perform a Formation Strike that does the
same damage and allows them to shift 1 square to end up adjacent to another
hobgoblin. So that fight is going to last even longer because the PCs will spend
much of it slowed and will find it hard to knock the hobs out of formation.</p>

<p>You will most likely want to leave these guys out of your game entirely, and use
Battle Guards in their stead.</p>

<h3 id="hobgoblin-battle-guard-mv">Hobgoblin Battle Guard (MV)</h3>

<p>This is the updated version of the Soldier above. It’s a Level 3 Soldier with 49
HP and most of the original’s frustrating features removed.</p>

<p>The flail attack still marks, but no longer slows. Hobgoblin Resilience is gone,
and Phalanx Soldier has been replaced by Share Shield, an interrupt that grants
an adjacent ally +2 to AC and Reflex against one attack that targets either of
those two defenses. Being an interrupt, it will only work once per turn, so it
can be overwhelmed by PCs without too much trouble. The Battle Guard gets
Phalanx Movement as well.</p>

<p>So in the end you have a soldier-type that gets stronger when it’s in a tight
formation with its fellow soldiers, but not so strong as to make the fight
impossible or super-long. It’s also easier to disrupt that formation.</p>

<h3 id="hobgoblin-spear-soldier-mv">Hobgoblin Spear Soldier (MV)</h3>

<p>A Level 3 Skirmisher with 48 HP, the spear soldier was made to complement the
Battle Guard above. It wields a longspear and carries a sheaf of javelins.</p>

<p>You want to have a line of spear soldiers in formation behind a line of battle
guards. All of them will advance together via Phalanx Movement. The spearhobs
will throw those Range 20 javelins as the unit closes in, and once melee starts
will attack with their Reach 2 spears from behind the safety of the battle guard
shield wall. Yes, Share Shield works on allies behind the user. If a PC manages
to get adjacent to one of them, they can shift 3 squares as a reaction.</p>

<h3 id="hobgoblin-beast-master-mv">Hobgoblin Beast Master (MV)</h3>

<p>Beast masters are Level 3 Controllers (Leaders) with 47 HP. While goblins prefer
to use their tamed beasts as mounts, these hobs are trained to wrangle a pack of
attack animals. They wield a goad (works as a war pick) in one hand and a whip
in the other.</p>

<p>Whenever a beast or magical beast ally adjacent to the beast master hits with an
attack, it gains 5 temporary HP. The beast master’s goad is a basic attack. The
whip does damage and knocks down on a hit, and can slide the target 1 square as
an effect. It can also choose to give an attack order to an adjacent beast or
magical beast ally, giving it a Lazy Warlord-style free basic attack.</p>

<p>The beast master has Phalanx Movement, which <em>does</em> work on its beasts since the
ability doesn’t specify the affected allies must be hobgoblins.</p>

<h3 id="hobgoblin-warcaster-mm">Hobgoblin Warcaster (MM)</h3>

<p>A Level 3 Controller (Leader) with 46 HP, representing a wizard who specializes
in electricity and force spells.</p>

<p>Warcasters carry staffs that do piddly damage as basic attacks, but which can be
charged with electricity (Melee 1 vs. AC; recharge 4-6) to do respectable
lightning damage and daze for a turn.</p>

<p>They can attack at range with force spells: Force Lure (Ranged 5 vs. Fortitude;
recharge 5-6) does force damage and slides 3 squares on a hit; Force Pulse
(Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex; Recharge 6) also does force damage, pushes 1 square
and knocks targets down. On a miss, it does half damage with no riders.</p>

<p>The warcaster doesn’t get special bonuses from being in formation, but it
benefits from Hobgoblin Resilience.</p>

<h3 id="hobgoblin-warmonger-mv">Hobgoblin Warmonger (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 4 Artillery (Leader) monster has 46 HP and is basically an upgraded
version of the Archer we already saw. It uses a mace in melee and a longbow at
range.</p>

<p>Its arrows do a fair bit of damage and cause the target to grant combat
advantage for a turn, which is simpler and more powerful than the archer’s
rider. It can also use a Battle Cry (Area burst 1 within 10 vs. Will) that has a
somewhat complicated effect.</p>

<p>Each ally in the burst gets to charge or make a basic attack as a free
action. If they hit, they gain 5 temporary HP. Each <em>enemy</em> in the burst is
subject to an attack against their Will, and if hit must make a basic attack
against a creature of the warmonger’s choosing. It yells “kill the wizard!” with
such conviction even the PCs must make an effort not to follow the order! Less
facetiously, this is likely some sort of Bane-powered charm, as it does have the
charm keyword.</p>

<p>Unlike the archer, the warmonger has Phalanx Movement, meaning it can march in
lockstep with its unit of bodyguards.</p>

<h3 id="hobgoblin-commander-both">Hobgoblin Commander (Both)</h3>

<p>A rare goblinoid stat block that has the same name in both books. Commanders are
Level 5 Soldiers (Leaders) with 64 HP. They wear scale and wield heavy shields
and spears.</p>

<p>The commander’s spear attacks mark for a turn. It also has a Lead from the Front
trait which gives its allies +2 to attack and damage for a turn against anyone
it hits with the spear.</p>

<p>While the commander lacks Phalanx Movement, it can issue orders for a Tactical
Deployment (Close Burst 5; recharge 5-6; minor action) to allow allies in the
burst to shift 3 squares. And it’s the sole MV hobgoblin to have Hobgoblin
Resilience.</p>

<p>The older MM version is pretty much identical, except it has worse damage and
can shift 1 square if it hits with an opportunity attack.</p>

<h3 id="hobgoblin-hand-of-bane-mm">Hobgoblin Hand of Bane (MM)</h3>

<p>Likely a powerful paladin of Bane. This is a Level 8 Elite Soldier with 184
HP. It wears plate, carries a heavy shield, and wields a flail.</p>

<p>This is the Flail of Dread, whose basic attacks mark for a turn and allow a
secondary attack against Will. A hit on that one gives the target -2 to all
defenses for the rest of the encounter or until the Hand of Bane dies. Yikes!</p>

<p>The flail can also be used in a Flail of Tyranny attack (recharge 6), which does
more damage and stuns for a turn on a hit.</p>

<p>Bane’s Blessing gives the Hand a +4 to its damage rolls once it’s first
bloodied, and it also has Hobgoblin Resilience. It lacks any formation-based
tricks, though.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The hobgoblin niche of being the “organized, militaristic” humanoids actually
makes them the most reasonable of the bunch. That’s admitedly not a very high
bar to clear in a “bunch” that includes gnolls and orcs, but it’s already
something.</p>

<p>A given band of hobgoblins is likely to be pursuing an objective more complex
than “kill everyone and raze every building”, and doesn’t need to be defeated
with that same tactic. They’ll leave if you can prevent them from accomplishing
their goals, and the truly reasonable among them will also leave if you manage
to negotiate a nonviolent solution.</p>

<p>Heck, it’s not impossible for a paragon or epic party to hire themselves a
company of hobgoblin mercs to help deal with a some aspect of a major threat. A
morally risky move, but not an impossibility.</p>

<p>Eberron goes further on this by making them not actually villainous. Its human
nations view the goblin kingdom of Darguun with suspicion, and it might become a
real menace if the wrong clan ascends to power, but it’s at it root no better or
worse than any other Khorvairian nation.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Like all goblinoids, Actual Goblins have been a part of D&amp;D since the beginning,
occupying the second rung of the Humanoid Power Ladder in those editions where
it was a thing. In Fourth Edition, they remain one of the first enemies a PC
party is likely to fight. Because of this they get a large number of stat blocks
across both books.</p>

<p>Since we’re already looked at goblin lore earlier, let’s skip right to…</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Goblins are Small Natural Humanoids, with low-light vision and Speed 6. Their
signature power is Goblin Tactics, a reaction that allows them to shift 1 square
when missed by a melee attack. This power does a lot to distinguish them from
kobolds, the <em>other</em> low-level humanoid opponents, who are shifty in a different
way. Skill-wise, pretty much all goblin variants we see here are trained in
Stealth and Thievery.</p>

<p>There are no less than seven goblin variants on the Monster Manual and another
four on the Monster Vault. The idea is, of course, that you should be able to
stock an entire dungeon with nothing but goblins. They are typically Evil.</p>

<h3 id="goblin-cutter-mm-and-goblin-sniper-mv">Goblin Cutter (MM) and Goblin Sniper (MV)</h3>

<p>The Cutter is a Level 1 Minion skirmisher. It wears leather is armed with a
shortsword, and has no other special powers aside from Goblin Tactics.</p>

<p>The Sniper from the MV is Level 1 Artillery, armed with a short sword and a
short bow. The ranged attack is the main difference from the Cutter, and being
Artillery it also has slightly lower AC. If a sniper fires from hiding and
misses, it remains hidden.</p>

<p>Both of these fill the same niche and are probably the closest to the classic
half-HD goblins from editions past. There’ll be a lot of them, they’ll swarm or
ambush you, and the survivors will flee as soon as they realize they’re losing
the battle. Snipers are better for those unfair ranged ambushes, but the higher
AC of cutters gives them better staying power in melee.</p>

<h3 id="goblin-blackblade-mm-and-goblin-cutthroat-mv">Goblin Blackblade (MM) and Goblin Cutthroat (MV)</h3>

<p>Our first non-minion Goblin is a Level 1 Lurker with 25 HP and all common
traits. It fights with a shortsword that suffers from the “naturalistic design”
flaw, which doesn’t hurt it much due to its low level. Blackblades can sneak
attack, and have a trait called Sneaky that allow them to switch places with
another level 1 ally when they shift.</p>

<p>Cutthroats are the MM updated version, Level 1 Skirmishers with 30 HP. The
damage of their shortswords has been updated, and they can attack at range 10
with thrown daggers. Sneaky gets replaced by Deft Scurry, a move action that
allows them to shift 3 squares.</p>

<h3 id="goblin-warrior-mm">Goblin Warrior (MM)</h3>

<p>This one is a Level 1 Skirmisher with 30 HP. It has a spear for fighting in
melee, and a sheaf of javelins for ranged combat.</p>

<p>Both attacks deal extra damage if the warrior moves at least 4 squares before
attacking, and it can also perform a Mobile Ranged attack that allows it to
shift half its speed and throw a javelin without provoking opportunity
attacks. This makes it rather easy for their javelins to get that extra damage.</p>

<h3 id="goblin-beast-rider-mv">Goblin Beast Rider (MV)</h3>

<p>Meant to be used alongside a mount, the beast rider is a Level 1 Skirmisher with
29 HP. It uses javelins both in melee and at range. It has the same “extra
damage after moving 4 squares” ability as the warrior above, but only when
mounted.</p>

<p>Its Goblin Tactics also only works when mounted, but it also triggers when the
mount is missed by a melee attack.</p>

<h3 id="goblin-sharpshooter-mm">Goblin Sharpshooter (MM)</h3>

<p>Essentially a nonminion version of the MV Sniper, above, this one is Level 2
Artillery with 31 HP. It uses a short sword and a hand crossbow, and has the
same Sniper ability that prevents a missed shot from canceling its stealth.</p>

<h3 id="goblin-hexer-mm-and-goblin-hex-hurler-mv">Goblin Hexer (MM) and Goblin Hex Hurler (MV)</h3>

<p>Despite the different names these are essentially the same monster, a goblin
spellcaster specializing in curses. The hexer is a Level 3 Controller (Leader)
with 46 HP and all standard goblin traits.</p>

<p>The MM version fights with a very weak “naturalistic” rod in melee, and mainly
relies on its ranged spells. Blinding Hex (Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude; at-will)
does damage and blinds (save ends); Stinging Hex (Ranged 10 vs. Will; recharge
5-6) damages the target if it moves in its next turn.</p>

<p>Vexing Cloud (Area Burst 3 Within 10; encounter) is some sort of enchanted
flatulence that creates a zone of the specified size. Enemies inside gain a -2
penalty to attack rolls, and allies gain concealment. It lasts a turn and can be
sustained with a minor action.</p>

<p>The hexer also has several triggered actions in addition to Goblin Tactics:</p>

<p>Incite Bravery (Ranged 10) allows an ally to shift 2 squares and make an attack
when Goblin Tactics activates for the hexer. This is deceptively powerful: note
the “an ally” and “an attack” wording! This works with any ally and it allows
them to use any of their available special attacks. Want to give that young
dragon some extra actions? Give him a hexer buddy!</p>

<p>Lead from the Rear is an interrupt that allows the hexer to redirect a ranged
attack targeting it to a nearby ally.</p>

<p>The Hex Hurler is very similar: it trades the weak rod for a staff that does the
right amount of damage and slides 1 square, and it loses Incite Bravery. That
last bit kinda makes sense once you realize how powerful it was.</p>

<p>You’ll generally want to use the Hex Hurler for all your hexing purposes.</p>

<h3 id="goblin-skullcleaver-mm">Goblin Skullcleaver (MM)</h3>

<p>The Skullcleaver is here to show you even goblins can be brutes. A Level 3 Brute
with 53 HP, it wears mail and wields a battleaxe in combat.</p>

<p>This one mostly works as a slightly beefier standard goblin until it gets
bloodied. Then it goes berserk, losing Goblin Tactics and dealing an extra 1d10
damage with its axe. In this state, it will always move to attack the closest
enemy, charging to reach it if possible.</p>

<h3 id="goblin-underboss-mv">Goblin Underboss (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 4 Elite Controller (Leader) might represent the chieftain of a
smaller goblin band or a lieutenant in a more numerous one. It has 110 HP, all
common goblin traits and is trained in Perception.</p>

<p>The Underboss wears mail and wields a shortsword. Unlike other elite monsters,
it can only attack once with the sword, but if it misses then an adjacent
underling can immediately perform a melee basic attack against the same
target. This goblin’s strong Survival Instinct grants it +3 to all defenses
while it’s bloodied, making it a lot harder to kill than might appear at first.</p>

<p>Its Goblin Tactics are upgraded to Superior Goblin Tactics, which allow the
underboss itself and up to 2 other allies to shift 1 square when it triggers.</p>

<p>In addition to fixing its damage, I’d suggest removing Survival Instinct and
giving it the ability to make two shortsword attacks with a standard action. I’d
also probably change its role from Controller to Soldier, since it doesn’t seem
to have a lot of controller-y abilities.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>In addition to their cliche role as monstrous raiders lairing just off the trade
route between two starting villages, goblins can be found working as
mercenaries. They’re also frequently enslaved by more powerful villains, which
must no doubt contribute to make their foul disposition worse. They will also
often be found accompanied by whatever attack beasts they’ve managed to tame.</p>

<p>Of course, if you don’t feel like looking for beasts or employers, you can
easily make all-goblin encounters with the stat blocks provided by the MM and
MV.</p>

<p>The all- or mostly-goblin encounters from the MM are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 1: 2 warriors, 2 fire beetles, 1 blackblade.</li>
  <li>Level 3: 2 sharpshooters, 4 warriors, 4 cutters.</li>
  <li>Level 5: 1 hexer, 2 skullcleavers, 2 sharpshooters, 12 cutters. That’s likely
the “boss room” in a goblin lair.</li>
</ul>

<p>We don’t get any goblins of a level higher than 4 in these books, but you can
certainly create some yourself if you give them the common traits outlined
above.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>If you’re playing D&amp;D you gotta have goblins, though these days I tend to be a
bit wary of the “two-legged vermin” image that has been traditionally ascribed
to them by older editions.</p>

<p>I’ll still include the occasional gang of goblin bandits and/or hired goons, of
course, but I also want to leave open the possibility that there are communities
of unaligned goblins out there, possibly even living alongside humans and other
“civilized” folk. Out of all the goblinoids, they seem like the ones more likely
to do that.</p>

<p>Eberron kinda went this way, if I recall correctly. 5e has gone in the other
direction and turned goblinoids as a whole into some sort of unstoppable fascist

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In Fourth Edition, “Goblin” is a noun that names both an entire set of related
species, and the runty jerks that are at least 50% likely to be your group’s
first adversaries. I like this ambiguity as a setting element, but since I
apparently already have problems being clear enough in these posts I’ll use the
older “Goblinoids” noun for the whole set.</p>

<p>“Goblinoids” is a word from older editions that is used to refer to goblins and
all related humanoid species. Orcs used to be a part of this clade back in the
AD&amp;D days, but became their own thing from 3e onwards. 4e just uses “Goblins” as
the catch-all term, encompassing actual goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears.</p>

<p>These three species used to make up a good chunk of the Humanoid Power Ladder
back in old D&amp;D, and have been part of the game since its inception. As
expected, they appear both in the Monster Manual and the Vault.</p>

<p>We find ourselves into yet another novel situation that wouldn’t really be
relevant when using the book normally. Goblinoid lore is fairly compact and
unified, but there are tons and tons of statblocks covering these three species
across two books. So what I’ll do here is cover all of their lore in this post,
and go over the stat blocks one species at a time in the next few posts.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>All Goblinoids share some common characteristics: large pointed ears, prominent
sharp teeth, skin that comes in several tones of yellow, green or red, and dark
hair. I imagine the several types are about as closely related as the several
types of elf. The MV says they can interbreed, with children taking after one of
the parents.</p>

<p>Goblinoids are one of the many peoples in the Points of Light setting to have
had a mighty empire in the past. This Goblin Empire was particularly successful,
dominating the world and extending to the Feywild. Its chief deity was Bane, the
Evil god of war and military conquest. Hobgoblins ran the show, and some sages
speculate goblins and bugbears were created through genetic engineering to
fulfill specific roles in their society. They also had an uncanny ability to
tame all sorts of wild beasts and press them into service, a skill retained by
present-day goblinoids.</p>

<p>Little concrete information is known about this empire. We can be fairly sure it
fell due to internecine strife, with some tales saying this strife was
instigated by the fey. Like many past world rulers, the goblinoids never
recovered, a pattern which spells grim tidings for the humans of Nerath.</p>

<p>While many former empire-builders live integrated with current “civilized”
society, goblinoids seem to have been driven from it. Either they were such
cruel overlords that no one wanted to have them around, or it happened through
some unfortunate historical development in the intervening centuries.</p>

<p>Present-day goblinoid culture is militaristic and xenophobic, still worshipping
Bane as their main deity alongside his exarchs Maglubyet and Hruggek. The three
subspecies mostly live apart from each other and have their own style of doing
things, but they really come into their own once they begin working together.</p>

<p>Small and ill-tempered, Goblins favor hidden villages where most inhabitants
live in a communal space and only the leaders get private quarters. They prefer
to build them close to “civilized” trade routes and settlements, as most of
their economy is based on raiding. They’re the most prolific beast tamers among
their kin. Goblin wolf riders are a classic, but they have no trouble using
whatever is available in their local environment, such as giant spiders in the
Underdark and plant creatures in the Feywild.</p>

<p>Bugbears tend to live among other goblinoids or roam in small bands. Despite
their great size and strength, they’re quite agile and sneaky. When living among
goblins, they’ll take charge of their weaker cousins through bullying and
intimidation, but will fall in line when commanded by hobgoblins. In any case,
they hate excessive talk and prever to go straight for the violent option as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>Hobgoblins are the most sophisticated members of the family, and the ones who
most fervently wish a return to their glory days. They have preserved a lot of
the military discipline and techniques from their fallen empire and are quite
adept at organizing themselves and other goblinoids into frighteningly effective
fighting forces. When this happens, Bugbears and Goblins go right back to their
original niches of shock troops and scouts (respectively), with hobgoblins
making up the rank and file and the top brass.</p>

<p>Every once in a while, a charismatic hobgoblin general will manage to
unite a large goblinoid army and march upon “civilization” bent on total
conquest. In the past, these were driven back by whatever incumbent empire was
there, but now there is none.</p>

<p>The language of the Monster Manual gives me a bit of pause. They use the word
“tribal” a lot, along with some terms that allude to vermin when describing
“actual” goblins. This is about par of the course for D&amp;D when you look at
previous editions, of course, but after that horrible Goblin Slayer anime I’m
hesitant to accept this portrayal. The MV steps back from this a bit. Goblinoids
are still a menace there, but the language is more similar to what I used in
this post.</p>

<p>The bit about the ancient and mighty Goblin Empire seems somewhat inspired by
Eberron, whose goblinoids have such an empire in their pasts and are actually on
the verge of seeing it restored through political unification and recognized as
a modern-day nation in Khorvaire. Khorvaire’s human cities even have goblin
populations living peacefully in them!</p>

<p>5e would double down on the “goblins are evil” idea and make them into basically
Nazis, with Maglubyet as their main god.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Gnomes were introduced as a playable race in the days of AD&amp;D, where they had a
niche as the nonhuman illusionists and were otherwise slightly smaller
dwarves. The removal of class and level restrictions in 3.x turned them into one
of the least popular race choices in the game in my experience. If you wanted to
play a short angry person you played a dwarf; if you wanted a short cute person
you played a halfling; and if you wanted a non-human wizard you played an elf.</p>

<p>This might have been one of the factors that kept them out of the PHB when 4e
was released, replaced by tieflings. They would eventually appear on the PHB 2,
but until then the only gnome stats we got were in the first Monster Manual.</p>

<p>This switch was announced in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UqFPujRZWo">one of the funniest pieces of D&amp;D marketing
ever</a> before the PHB had been even published, which had the unfortunate side
effect of turning every edition warrior into a campaigner for gnome rights until
the publication of the PHB 2.</p>

<p>Gnomes appear both in the MM and in the MV. Interestingly, if you’re going
Essentials-only gnomes once again drop from the list of playable races and
appear only in the monster book.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Gnomes don’t exist, or so they would have you believe. This diminutive fey
people endured a long period of slavery at the hands of the fomorians, but were
able to escape with the (unwitting, according to some legends) help of the
eladrin. They kinda compete with eladrin for the title of “most fey playable
race”, as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>Since that remote past, they’ve spread all over the Feywild and the world,
though few know it. Gnome culture values cunning and discretion, since it
developed in a hostile environment full of much larger creatures bent on hunting
them. Gnome communities are extremely well-hidden, even when they’re located
within large human cities. In that case, gnomes might build their homes between
the walls of neighboring buildings or under their floors, wainscot-fantasy style.</p>

<p>Their interpersonal relations are similarly camouflaged. The typical gnome is
suspicious of strangers and very slow to trust, but hides that behind a mask of
pleasantness and even frivolity. In the worst case, this suspicion can sour into
paranoia and lead a gnome down the path of evil. Some of them even work as spies
and assassins for the fomorians.</p>

<p>A large percentage of gnomes train in magic, becoming wizards or warlocks and
focusing on illusions. Even a gnome untrained in magic can turn invisible.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gnomes are Small Fey Humanoids with a typical speed of 5 and low-light
vision. They have two signature traits: Fade Away is an encounter power that
allows them to turn invisible for a turn or until they attack, and Reactive
Stealth allows them to make a Stealth check to become hidden when they roll
initiative, if they have any degree of cover or concealment at that point. The
MV gnomes frequently trade those for improved powers along the same line.</p>

<p>All the gnomes we see in these books are Unaligned, as is traditional for PC or
PC-adjacent peoples. They could be used as enemies or allies depending on the
story. Let’s look at them in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-skulk-mm">Gnome Skulk (MM)</h3>

<p>This Level 2 Lurker has 34 HP and all common traits, including both powers. It
wields a war pick and a hand crossbow, and wears leather.</p>

<p>The basic pick attack has the High Crit property, and the skulk deals an extra
1d6 damage on any attack where it has combat advantage. If it attacks from
hiding and misses, the gnome skulk remains hidden.</p>

<p>Your basic rogue-type, with a few additional tricks that give it the ability to
keep hidden for longer.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-arcanist-mm">Gnome Arcanist (MM)</h3>

<p>One of those magically-trained gnomes. This is a Level 3 Controller with 46 HP
and all common traits including the two powers. It projects a 5-square Aura of
Illusion that grants concealment to itself and all allies within. The arcanist
wields a pitifully weak dagger as a basic attack and relies on ranged spells for
actual fighting.</p>

<p>Its main ranged attack is a Scintillating Bolt (Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) which
does radiant damage and dazes (save ends). As a minor action it can also fire
off a Startling Glamor (Ranged 10 vs. Will) that does no damage and slides the
target 1 square. It can also cast Illusory Terrain (Close Burst 5 vs. Will),
which does no damage and slows all enemies in the area.</p>

<p>In addition to the already-mentioned gnome racial powers, the arcanist also
borrows the Eladrin’s Fey Step.</p>

<p>Despite its low damage potential, the arcanist is still quite dangerous when
paired with other monsters that can fill that function. It has an at-will daze!</p>

<h3 id="gnome-spy-mv">Gnome Spy (MV)</h3>

<p>Basically a more powerful version of the MM Skulk, this gnome is a Level 5
Lurker with 51 HP, trained Perception, and all common gnome traits including the
two powers. It is, in fact the last gnome in this post to have those powers at
all.</p>

<p>The spy fights with a short sword in melee, and throws daggers out to
Range 10. Both do extra damage if the gnome is invisible to the target when it
attacks.</p>

<p>Aside from the reactive Fade Away power, the gnome spy can also turn invisible
for a turn or until it attacks as a standard action.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-illusionist-mv">Gnome Illusionist (MV)</h3>

<p>A more powerful gnome wizard, this one is Level 6 Artillery with 57 HP and all
common traits except for the powers. It’s also trained in Bluff and Stealth.</p>

<p>The illusionist’s weapon is a Gnarled Staff that’s nothing special in melee, but
likely acts as an implement for its spells. Bedazzle (Area Burst 1 within 10
vs. Will) is an at-will attack that does radiant damage and makes targets grant
combat advantage (save ends); See Me Not (Close Blast 3 vs. Will; recharge 5-6)
does psychic damage and makes the gnome invisible to the targets (save ends).</p>

<p>As a move-action encounter power the illusionist can use There, Not There, a
spell that teleports it 5 squares and creates two illusory doubles within 5
squares of the destination. These last until the original attacks or until they
are destroyed - they have 1 HP and the same defenses as the original. The
illusionist can use its actions to have them do anything it could, except use
powers.</p>

<p>As an at-will minor action the illusionist can disguise itself and 2 allies
within 5 squares as any Small or Medium creature. Seeing through the illusion
requires an opposed Insight check against the gnome’s Bluff.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-assassin-mv">Gnome Assassin (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 7 Skirmisher with 78 HP and all common traits except for the
powers. It wears leather and wields paired katars.</p>

<p>The katars are its basic attack, and do extra damage if the assassin attacks out
of Shade Form. Shade Form, in turn, is an encounter power that recharges when
the assassin is bloodied. It lasts for a turn or until it attacks. While this
power is active, the assassin is insubstantial, has Vulnerable 5 Radiant, and
can make Stealth checks to become hidden if it has any cover or concealment.</p>

<p>In addition to all this, the assassin can use Shadow Step as an at-will move
action, using its enemies’ shadows as portals. It teleports 3 squares to another
shadow and sheds any mark applied to it. It must start and end the teleport
adjacent to another creature, since it’s using their shadows for this.</p>

<p>You better keep your squishies far away from your defenders when fighting gnome
assassins (and hope they don’t appear near your squishies).</p>

<h3 id="gnome-entropist-mv">Gnome Entropist (MV)</h3>

<p>Our final gnome is another spellcaster, Level 8 Artillery with 71 HP and all
common traits except the powers.</p>

<p>Despite being a blasty mage, the Entropist is still skilled at illusion. Its
Illusory Defenses give it a +2 bonus against ranged attacks, and it upgrades the
standard Fade Away power to Disappearing Act, which lasts for a turn and
<em>doesn’t</em> end when the gnome attacks.</p>

<p>The entropist fights in melee with a Touch of Chaos that does acid damage, and
at range with an Entropic Arc (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex) that does physical damage
and prevents the target from taking immediate and opportunity actions for a
turn. Perfect to let a fellow skirmisher pop free from the PC fighter.</p>

<p>Its “special” attack is Chaos Flare (Area Burst 1 within 15 vs. Will) which
affects only enemies and recharges if it misses all targets. A hit does physical
damage and blinds (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter in the MM is level 3: 2 arcanists, 2 iron defenders
(low-level constructs) and a pseudodragon. They’re likely a guard patrol for one
of those hidden settlements, which is likely to be quite awkward for the humans
whose basement houses the main gate.</p>

<p>I like 4e’s take on gnomes as secretive fey tricksters, as it gives them a
distinctive flavor. It borrows a bit from Eberron, whose gnome nation of Zilargo
is the best at the great game of spying and intrigue in a setting already rife
with it. Pathfinder apparently went in a similar direction with its gnomes as
well, though theirs are less sneaky and more whimsical. This version of gnomes
survives in 5e as the “Forest Gnome” subrace.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Gnolls have been in the game since the beginning or close to it, when they fit
in the Humanoid Power Ladder right above hobgoblins and before bugbears. In 4e,
they are present in both books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Once the Humanoid Power Ladder got dismantled, just being “the 2 HD humanoid” no
longer cut it as the gnoll identity. And in Fourth Edition, they are now widely
known as the Least Reasonable Humanoids.</p>

<p>You see, the vast majority of these hyena-faced people your group ends up
fighting will be worshippers of the demon lord Yeenoghu, whose teachings can be
summed up as “kill and eat everything you see”. Gnoll bands are nomadic and roam
around fulfilling that mandate. They never build permanent structures, and even
their gear is mostly taken from those they killed. Sometimes they take slaves,
but those slaves never last long. Mostly they just kill and eat people. In
short, they’re the closest you can get to a demon while still having the natural
origin. You can frequently find actual demons in their midst, either summoned by
their priests or sent by Yeenoghu to boss them around. Their warriors carry all
sorts of demonic boons into battle as well.</p>

<p>No one else cooperates with gnolls. If you try they’ll eat you, and if you’re
strong enough to prevent them from eating you, you don’t need their help in the
first place.</p>

<p>There was a Dragon article with presented playable gnolls who were members of a
dissident faction that rejected demon worship. They are fierce and honorable
hunters, most often Good or Unaligned, and a lot more likely to cooperate with
others. I liked them a lot and I’m sad they never showed up again after that one
article.</p>

<p>The gnolls we’ll be looking at there are the usual “fanatical demon worshipper”
variety.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gnolls are Medium Natural Humanoids and typically Chaotic Evil. The gnoll
mechanical schtick is that they punch above their weight class. They get a +2
bonus to damage when bloodied, and their signature trait is Pack Attack, which
gives a further +5 damage bonus if their target has two or more of the
attacker’s allies next to it. Their land speed is 8, making it very hard for
innocent civilians to escape from them. And they have low-light vision, to
better chase you in the dark.</p>

<p>Unfortunately their MM incarnations suffer from the same “naturalistic design”
variant of the damage bug we saw with foulspawn. It’s less egregious due to
their lower level, but it does mean that a bloodied gnoll benefiting from Pack
Attack juuust manages to hit the average damage expected by the new math.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault variants behave like they’re supposed to, with their basic
damage hitting the expected average and the add-ons applying on top of
that. Don’t let them surround you!</p>

<p>There’s little overlap between the stat blocks in both books, which leaves us
with a lot of gnolls to look at. Fortunately most of them are fairly
simple. Let’s mix them all and look at them by level.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-huntmaster-both">Gnoll Huntmaster (Both)</h3>

<p>Huntmasters are level 5 artillery with 50 HP and all common gnoll traits. They
fight in melee with a handaxe, and at range with a longbow. Other than their
damage numbers, the two statblocks are identical.</p>

<p>The common traits are the entirety of huntmaster’s special tricks, which are
actually respectable since Pack Attack works with the longbow. The gnoll itself
doesn’t have to be adjacent to the target, only its allies!</p>

<h3 id="deathpledged-gnoll-mv">Deathpledged Gnoll (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 5 Brute has 75 HP and all common gnoll traits. It fights with a
spear, and generally wants to engage someone and stand its ground to both do
damage and give its buddies the benefit of Pack Attack.</p>

<p>This gnoll is “deathpledged” because when it first hits 0 HP, it goes berserk!
It regains 5 HP, gains Resist 15 All, and 1 action point! At the end of its next
turn, though, it drops dead. This means it’s going to use that last turn to
attack twice if you don’t manage to kill it first. This power is named Claws of
Yeenoghu.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-claw-fighter-mm">Gnoll Claw Fighter (MM)</h3>

<p>This Level 6 Skirmisher has 70 HP and likes to tear people apart with its bare
hands.</p>

<p>Its basic melee attack is a single claw strike, and it can make two of those
when it charges. It can also perform a Mobile Melee Attack that allows it to
make a claw strike and move a total of 4 squares at any point in the
action, without provoking opportunity attacks when moving away from the target
of the attack.</p>

<p>This gives us a pretty obvious routine: charge one turn, attack and move away on
the next. Fix the damage of the gnoll’s claws if you plan on using it, though,
it’s really low as printed.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-marauder-mm">Gnoll Marauder (MM)</h3>

<p>This Level 6 Brute has 84 HP and all common gnoll traits. It fights with a
spear, which makes me think it was an earlier version of the Deathpledged Gnoll
above.</p>

<p>Instead of the Claws of Yeenoghu power, the marauder has Quick Bite, which
allows it to make a free-action bite attack against a bloodied enemy it just hit
with the spear. This does a bit less damage than the spear, but it’s pretty good
for a bonus attack.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-blood-caller-mv">Gnoll Blood Caller (MV)</h3>

<p>Our first spellcaster is a Level 6 Soldier with 70 HP and all common gnoll
traits.</p>

<p>The blood caller fights with its claws, which mark for a turn as an effect. It
can follow that up with Blood Call (Close Burst 5 vs. Will), which targets every
enemy marked by the gnoll. A hit does psychic damage and pulls the target up to
3 squares. The gnoll itself can shift 3 squares as an effect, too.</p>

<p>Once the gnoll is bloodied it can use Blood Frenzy as a 1/round minor
action. This automatically deals a bit of damage to every enemy in a Close Burst
1 and marks them for a turn. And now you know why Blood Call is an area effect.</p>

<p>This is another monster that will make up the frontline in a gnoll encounter to
provide Pack Attack bonuses, and it has a few tricks to pull the PCs into more
favorable positions for that.</p>

<h3 id="fang-of-yeenoghu-mv">Fang of Yeenoghu (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 7 Skirmisher (Leader) has 77 HP and all common gnoll traits. It’s
another one of those caster-types.</p>

<p>The Fang of Yeenoghu wields a Cudgel of Bloody Teeth in combat, whose blows also
deal ongoing damage (save ends). Its other melee attack is a Relentless Push:
the gnoll can shift 2 squares before the attack, which does a bit less damage
than the basic cudgel blow and pushes the target 1 square. After this, one of
the gnoll’s allies within 5 squares can shift 1 square as a free action. I think
this is the most complicated gnoll power I’ve seen so far.</p>

<p>Its final technique is Howl of the Demon (Close Burst 5; Recharge 6), which
allows every ally in the burst to make a free melee basic attack.</p>

<p>It looks like the Fang’s main concern in a fight will be to position the PCs and
its allies so that all of them benefit from Pack Attack, and then let loose the
Howl.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-gorger-mv">Gnoll Gorger (MV)</h3>

<p>This most psychotic of gnolls is a Level 7 Brute with 96 HP and all common gnoll
traits. Its only attack is a bite that does Brute-tier damage, and as a minor
action it can Gorge, which means it takes a bite out of an ally. This deals 5
damage to the ally and heals the gorger for 5 HP.</p>

<p>That’s some real horrific imagery right there.</p>

<h3 id="demon-eye-gnoll-mv">Demon-Eye Gnoll (MV)</h3>

<p>This level 7 Lurker has 62 HP and all common traits. Plus, the Abyss leaks out
of its eyes.</p>

<p>This gnoll fights with a Reach 2 glaive, which does extra damage if the target
can’t see it. It has a Stare into the Abyss power (Close Burst 3 vs. Will) that
dazes and makes the gnoll invisible to the targets for a turn.</p>

<p>Once bloodied, the Abyss starts leaking through the gnoll’s wounds too,
functioning as an Aura 3 that deals psychic damage to those enemies caught
within and forces them to make a melee basic attack against an ally if they’re
dazed.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-demonic-scourge-mm">Gnoll Demonic Scourge (MM)</h3>

<p>This Level 8 Brute (Leader) has 106 HP and all common traits. It projects an
aura of command that gives a +1 attack bonus to allies within 5 squares, or +2
if the demonic scourge is bloodied.</p>

<p>It wields a heavy flail in combat, which can knock its targets prone if they’re
bloodied. And when it bloodies someone with the flail, an ally can make a free
melee basic attack against the target. Once per encounter, the gnoll can grant
this free attack to 2 allies instead of 1.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-far-fang-mv">Gnoll Far Fang (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 8 Artillery menace has 68 HP and is mostly an up-leveled version of
the huntmaster. It has one extra trick: a volley of Hungry Arrows (Area Burst 2
Within 10 vs. AC; Encounter) which does longbow damage plus ongoing damage (save
ends).</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-pack-lord-mv">Gnoll Pack Lord (MV)</h3>

<p>A Level 8 Controller (Leader) with 90 HP, this seems like a more complex version
of the demonic scourge above. It’s also pretty much a lazy warlord.</p>

<p>Its basic flail attack is nothing special, but it can cast a Demonic Frenzy
charm (Ranged 10 vs. Will) that does no damage, but dazes for a turn as an
<em>effect</em>. On a hit, it also inflicts a -2 attack penalty and forces the target
to make 2 basic attacks against targets of the gnoll’s choice.</p>

<p>It can also use a power called Feed on the Weak (Area Burst 1 within 5
vs. Will), which does no damage but causes the target to grant combat advantage
for a turn <em>and</em> allows an ally in the burst to make an attack as a free action.</p>

<p>As a minor action, it can use a Pack Cackle (Close Burst 5; recharge 5-6) to
allow its allies to shift 2 squares as a free action.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-demon-spawn-mv">Gnoll Demon Spawn (MV)</h3>

<p>Our final gnoll is a Level 9 Brute with 120 HP, who is Large but still a Natural
Humanoid despite that demonic ancestry. An upgraded version of the Gorger, it
fights with its claws and can take a bite out of its <em>enemies</em> to heal
itself. This is a minor action, and requires an attack roll since no PC is just
going to stand there and let it happen.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m not going to detail the MM encounters here, as this post is already too
long. You can guess what they look like: groups of assorted gnolls, with the
occasional pack of hyenas and evistro demons thrown in. As I said above, no one
else can work with these maniacs.</p>

<p>When it comes to humanoids and other “sapient, natural” opposition, I don’t mind
if the specific group the PCs are fighting is villainous. However it does bother
me a bit when the game seems to say every single member of the species is
similarly evil. That solitary Dragon article could have opened the way for a
setting where your typical gnoll is a person and not necessarily hostile, with
the ones you fight being those individuals who chose an evil path (much like the
game treats humans). Instead, it was never officially built upon and in fact 5e
went in the other direction and made gnolls into basically another type of
demon.</p>

<p>Anyway, these stat blocks make for mechanically interesting enemies and we have
enough of them to build entire dungeons with nothing but gnolls as the
opposition. Do grab that Dragon article if you can, I remember the playable
version was also quite good.</p>
