<p>Satyrs were inspired by Greek myth and have been in the game since at least the
days of BECMI. Here, they are only on the Monster Manual, but they get an update
in Dungeon 196 and become a playable character option in Heroes of the Feywild.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>According to the MM, satyrs are self-centered, greedy and decadent fey who live
to party. They’ll usually behave in a friendly manner to passing strangers and
invite them for a spot of good food and drink. If they’re in a good mood, the
offer will be genuine. If not, the satyrs will rob and maybe kill their guests
once their guard is down. That food and drink doesn’t come cheap,
y’know. Conversely, they’re always on the lookout for danger and trickery even
while partying their hardest, for such is life in the Feywild.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Feywild, which includes satyrs as a PC option, is a bit softer on
them. It says satyrs are by nature both curious and skittish, despite their
hedonistic streak. So they’ll tend to investigate things from a distance and
rely on their charm magic to defend themselves if it comes to that. A lot of
their bad reputation comes from bad encounters between somewhat xenophobic
humans and the first satyrs who crossed over from the Feywild.</p>

<p>Even the MM says satyrs are Unaligned despite its unflattering description of
them, so the stat blocks in this entry could be used as NPC allies as easily as
they could be enemies who <em>do</em> live up to the bad reputation.</p>

<p>A curiosity: all satyrs are male. Their mothers are usually the always-female
nymphs, whose sons are satyrs and whose daughters are other nymphs. The
raunchiness and propensity for sexual harassment of mythological satyrs has been
excised from both depictions, though you could add it back to particularly
villainous individuals.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Satyrs are Medium Fey Humanoids with speed 6 and low-light vision. Everything
else varies per stat block, and we get two.</p>

<h3 id="satyr-rake">Satyr Rake</h3>

<p>This is a mobile rogue-type, wearing leather and carrying a short sword and
short bow. It’s all about running around the party and setting up sneak attacks
with its clever feints.</p>

<p>Rakes are Level 7 Skirmishers with 80 HP. The <strong>sword</strong> and <strong>bow</strong> are its
basic attacks, and it will prefer the former once the PCs get in melee
range. They do extra damage with all attacks if they have combat advantage.</p>

<p>A rake can employ a <strong>Feint</strong> (melee 1 vs. Reflex; minor action) to make a
target grant combat advantage for a turn, so it’s dangerous even without a
flanking buddy. It can also make a <strong>Harrying Attack</strong> (recharge 5-6) which
allows it to make two basic attacks and shift 3 squares between them.</p>

<p>Aside from the updated damage, the only difference between the MM and Dungeon
versions is that the MM Feint is at-will, and the one from Dungeon recharges
when the satyr hits with a basic melee attack. This gives the target a breather
from the constant feinting if the satyr misses.</p>

<h3 id="satyr-piper">Satyr Piper</h3>

<p>A mystically-inclined archer who can produce several mental effects with its
music.</p>

<p>Pipers are Level 8 Controllers with the Leader keyword. Their basic melee attack
is a <strong>gore</strong> with their horns, which does some damage and knocks the victim
prone so the piper can move away. Their main weapon is the <strong>longbow</strong>, but
they’ll switch to playing the pipes when the enemy gets close enough.</p>

<p>These <strong>Wooden Pipes</strong> take a standard action to play and can be sustained with
further standard actions. Their musical magic works in a close burst 5 and can
be either an attack vs. Will that dazes enemies for a turn or one of three
effects that grant allies attack and damage bonuses, free shifts, or free
saves. I think the piper can select a different effect for a given turn without
having to stop the music.</p>

<p>While pipers have to choose between being leaders or combatants, they’re very
effective leaders. The beneficial songs work on every ally in the burst at once!
A piper accompanying a squad of melee bruisers, or a cluster of artillery
monsters, can really increase their threat level.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is level 8 and features a piper, three rakes, and a
displacer beast.</p>

<p>Satyrs fit perfectly as those irresponsible fey who like to “tame” fey beasts
via charm magic instead of doing it the hard way, so you can justify them having
any sort of pet. They also gladly team up with other sapients who have the same
tastes (whether for partying or robbery, depending on the satyr).</p>

<p>Salamanders have been a part of the game since AD&amp;D 1st Edition at least, and
also play a part in Mystara. In 4e, they’re present only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Salamanders are sapient fire elementals who live in the hotter regions of the
Elemental Chaos. As a people they tend to be cruel, greedy and
authoritarian. Their society is feudal, ruled by an European-style hierarchy of
nobles: dukes and duchesses, kings and queens, and so on.</p>

<p>Salamanders will gladly serve more powerful masters such as efreets, giants and
dragons if the pay is right, and they do so with unflinching loyalty. They also
expect the same from their own underlings. Either in the service of these
masters or for their own benefit, salamanders often raid the natural world
through planar rifts in order to plunder it and take slaves.</p>

<p>These slaves from the world make up the bottom ranks of salamander society, and
include not only mortals but also magma beasts and other “weaker” elementals.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Salamanders are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Fire and Reptile
keywords. They have a land speed of 6 and 20 fire resistance, but no special
senses and no special vulnerability to cold.</p>

<p>They use weapons to fight, but can also do something with their powerful snake
tails and employ some sort of fire magic that varies with the specific
salamander. Their weapons have ongoing fire damage riders, and they’re fast
enought to attack twice per action.</p>

<p>More details below:</p>

<h3 id="salamander-lancer">Salamander Lancer</h3>

<p>This Level 14 Brute has 171 HP and fights with a Reach 3 <strong>Longspear</strong> that does
physical damage and ongoing fire damage. It can spin the spear around to form a
<strong>Whirlwind of Fire</strong> that does the same damage in a Close Burst 3 and recharges
on a 6.</p>

<p>It can also attack with a Reach 2 <strong>Tail Lash</strong> that’s a little weaker than the
spear and slides the target 1 square. I suppose it will mostly use that for the
slide, since the spear is better in all other respects.</p>

<h3 id="salamander-firetail">Salamander Firetail</h3>

<p>A Level 14 Skirmisher with 138 HP, this one fights with a Reach 2 <strong>scimitar</strong>
with an ongoing fire damage rider. It can make two such attacks per standard
action, and has the same Tail Lash as the Lancer.</p>

<p>Its special attack is the <strong>Trail of Fire</strong>, which allows the salamander to move
its speed and leave a brief trail of fire behind it. Anyone it passes adjacent
to takes 10 fire damage, but the trail doesn’t persist on the map after that.</p>

<h3 id="salamander-archer">Salamander Archer</h3>

<p>Another straightforward monster, it’s Level 15 Artillery with 114 HP. Its
<strong>longbow</strong> has the usual ongoing fire damage rider and it can attack twice per
standard action.</p>

<p>The archer uses its tail as an emergency melee weapon: it can use it either in a
<strong>Tail Lash</strong> that does fire damage with no special effects or a minor-action
<strong>Tail Thrust</strong> vs. Reflex that does no damage and pushes the target 1
square. That last one is actually the better bet, as it would allow the archer
to immediately follow it up with two arrows to the offender’s face.</p>

<h3 id="salamander-noble">Salamander Noble</h3>

<p>A level 15 controller with 152 HP, the noble is the first salamander whose
primary weapon its its tail.</p>

<p><strong>Tail Crush</strong> is its basic attack, doing fire damage and grabbing the target on
a hit (escape DC 27). The grabbed victim automatically takes this attack’s
damage at the start of its turn.</p>

<p>The noble will use its <strong>Longspear</strong> to attack the other PCs while it has a
victim grabbed, which works pretty much like the Lancer’s spear above. No Double
Attack here, though.</p>

<p>Finally, the noble can cause a <strong>Fire Cage</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Reflex) to sprout
around a target. A hit immobilizes and deals ongoing fire damage (save ends)
without blocking line of sight to the target so the archers can keep shooting
it.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounters have salamanders working alongside fire archons, a
beholder eye of flame, red dragons, and lots of azers. The latter are either
giant envoys, or slaves of the salamanders themselves.</p>

<p>I think salamanders work well as fire elemental opposition that’s okay to beat
up. An azer is probaly fighting you against its will, but a salamander isn’t.</p>

<p>Sahuagin have been in the game since at least AD&amp;D 1. Here, they are present in
the Monster Manual, and get an update in Dungeon 193.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Back when I talked about Kuo-Toa, I mentioned I had a hard time distinguishing
between the various types of “fish people with spears”. At last, we have a
chance to figure out what makes kuo-toa and sahuagin different.</p>

<p>Sahuagin are also known as sea devils because they tend to be murderously
hostile to everyone who isn’t them. These fish people are said to share several
characteristics with sharks (though you can’t really see it in the
illustration).</p>

<p>They build settlements in coastal waters using materials like stone and
coral. These range in size from small villages to cities with six thousand
inhabitants or more. Sahuagin society is patriarchal and heavily hierarchic:
each village is ruled by a baron; princes rule groups of up to twenty villages;
and each sahuagin kingdom is ruled by a king living in one of those cities.</p>

<p>These kingdoms seem to claim both their surrounding waters and the nearby coasts
as territory. Though sahuagin sometimes trade with other people living in this
territory, they’ll almost always raid their settlements and ships instead,
taking what they want.</p>

<p>Sahuagin are deeply religious and I guess a lot of their orneriness comes from
their choice of deity: they venerate Sekolah, a shark god who is one of Melora’s
exarchs. Female sahuagin have an hierarchy of their own that emphasizes their
role as priests, teachers, and loremasters. The main tenets of their culture and
religion can be summed up as: “always be the hunter and not the hunted”; “if an
action is successful, then it is right” and “meat is meat”. That last bit means
they have no qualms about eating anyone, even their own when they get too weak
to hunt.</p>

<p>Despite such brutal teachings Sekolah is still a god. Both it and its favored
people hate demons with a passion, particularly Demogorgon and Dagon. So yeah,
there might come a time when the party finds itself on the same side of a battle
as a bunch of sahuagin.</p>

<p>One last bit the MV touches on is that the sea devils are very prone to genetic
mutation, so lots of them have some deviation from the “typical” sahuagin
form. Some of these are very prized, such as the one that gives an individual
four arms and marks them as suitable for the mantle of nobility. A rare and
reviled mutation is the one that produces “malenti”, sauhagin so deformed and
ugly by the standards of their society that they almost resemble greenish sea
elves. Considered pariahs in saghuagin society, they’re employed as ambassadors
and spies to people who think they’re pretty. Their true mission is almost
always to set up a backstab rather than to engage in any diplomacy in good
faith.</p>

<p>So, in the end, what distinguishes a sahuagin from a kuo-toa? Both are deeply
religious and universally hostile fish people who like hafted weapons, but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sahuagin inhabit the surface world, Kuo-toa the Underdark.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sahuagin use tridents, kuo-toa use spears and harpoons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sahuagin worship Sekolah, Kuo-toa worship aboleths and/or some cthulhoid
entity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sahuagin are scaly, kuo-toa are slimy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sahuagin have pretty infiltrators, kuo-toa do not.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Another difference is mechanical: kuo-toa are levels 14-16, while sahuagin are
levels 6-10. So there is a kind of power ladder for fish people too.</p>

<p>Most sahuagin are Medium Natural Humanoids, though the four-armed nobles are
Large. All have the Aquatic keyword, low-light vision, a land speed of 6 and a
swim speed of 6 or 8.</p>

<p>Most sahuagin fight with tridents, which can be used in melee or thrown. The MM
version has range 3/6 when thrown, and the MV version has range 5. The MM makes
it explicit that the trident must be retrieved to be used in melee again, since
most sahuagin only carry a single one into combat. It wouldn’t be hard to say
they have two so they can thrown one as they approach.</p>

<p>Their signature ability is <strong>Blood Frenzy</strong>, which gives them a +1 to attacks
and +2 to damage against bloodied enemies, and is an extra incentive for them to
gang up on such targets.</p>

<p>Aside from the updated damage, the stat blocks from Dungeon are identical to
the MM originals.</p>

<p>I’m including a small bonus here: a stat block for sharks. Though the Monster
Manual lore for sahuagin mentions sharks several times, it includes no stats for
sharks anywhere within it, leaving that as an exercise to the reader. The
Monster Vault, despite not containing sahuagin, has stats for sharks in its
animal appendix.</p>

<h3 id="shark-mv">Shark (MV)</h3>

<p>This can stand in for any species of shark large and aggressive enough to target
humans or pal around with Sahuagin. It’s a Medium Natural Beast with the Aquatic
keyword, and a Level 5 Brute with 75 HP. It swims with speed 8, and if the PCs
ever push it into dry land it will only be able to flop around at speed 1
(clumsy). It has low-light vision, though you should probably give it some form
of blindsense as well if you want to be realistic.</p>

<p>Sharks attack with a <strong>bite</strong>, of course, and the <strong>Aquatic</strong> trait means
they’ll pretty much always have a +2 attack bonus on that. They also have a
<strong>Blood Frenzy</strong> trait which gives them a further +2 to attacks and +4 to damage
against bloodied creatures.</p>

<h3 id="sahuagin-guard">Sahuagin Guard</h3>

<p>These are Level 6 Minion Brutes, with all the standard traits above. Their swim
speed is 6.</p>

<p>Like pretty much all sahuagin, they fight with <strong>tridents</strong>, which can be used
in melee or thrown, and have no other special attacks.</p>

<h3 id="sahuagin-raider">Sahuagin Raider</h3>

<p>A non-minion version of the Guard, it’s a Level 6 Soldier with 70 HP. It fights
with the same weapons and tactics, and has an extra ability: <strong>Opportunistic
Strike</strong>, a reaction that allows it to attack a flanked enemy that shifts.</p>

<p>They’ll cooperate with other raiders and melee monsters to keep enemies
flanked.</p>

<h3 id="sahuagin-priest">Sahuagin Priest</h3>

<p>Priests are level 8 Artillery with 70 HP. They have all standard traits and
their swim speed is 8.</p>

<p>They have the usual <strong>trident</strong> that can be used in melee or thrown, but they
also have much better ranged options. <strong>Water Bolt</strong> (ranged 10 vs. AC) does
physical damage, and has double the range and a damage bonus when used
underwater. <strong>Spectral Jaws</strong> (ranged 20 vs. Will) makes shark jaws appear and
bite into the target. This does a good chunk of physical damage, and inflicts
both ongoing physical damage and a -2 penalty to all defenses (save ends
both). It recharges when the target makes its save.</p>

<p>All of those magic attacks benefit from Blood Frenzy, by the way.</p>

<h3 id="sahuagin-baron">Sahuagin Baron</h3>

<p>Barons are Large, and have four arms. They’re Level 10 Elite Brutes with the
Leader keyword, 256 HP, and a swim speed of 8. They emit a <strong>Blood Healing</strong>
aura 10 that heals every ally inside that starts its turn adjacent to a bloodied
enemy for 5 HP.</p>

<p>Barons fight with the usual <strong>trident</strong> but also with their <strong>claws</strong>, which
count as a second basic attack. <strong>Baron’s Fury</strong> allows them to attack with the
trident and two claws per standard action.</p>

<p>Barons upgrade the usual Blood Frenzy to <strong>Blood Hunger</strong>, which gives them +2
to attacks and +5 to damage rolls against bloodied enemies.</p>

<p>We get no stats for princes or kings, but it’s possible they’d use the baron
stats, maybe with a few added levels.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Most sahuagin encounters will be against all-sahuagin groups, since they’re
pretty xenophobic. The main exception, surprisingly, is vampires: they and the
sahuagin apparently bond over their shared love of blood. Underwater encounters
might involve pet sharks, too.</p>

<p>Rust Monsters are a D&amp;D original, inspired by some cheap plastic “dinosaur”
figures Gygax had lying around and intended to use as miniatures. In 4e they
first appear in the Monster Manual 2 and later in the Monster Vault, so we’ll be
peaking ahead a bit.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Rust monsters came about naturally, even though plenty of people swear they were
created by a spiteful god who thought mortals had too much shiny stuff. Everyone
hates these things.</p>

<p>Rust monsters feed on metal, by secreting powerful enzymes which dissolve it and
slurping the slurry. Normally they target ore veins and leech the metal out of
them, but items made of processed metal draw them like blood in the water draws
sharks. Since food is usually scarce, rust monsters tend to have only one or two
young per brood, but when they find a plentiful source of metal like a lode or a
civilized settlement, their broods increase in size to make use of that bounty.</p>

<p>It’s not just adventurers who curse these creatures! They get into civilized
settlements and mines and eat away at all the metal tools, fittings, and support
beams if you let them. Some dwarf and duergar settlements develop complex wards
to keep them at bay, but their effectiveness is limited - some rust monsters
have a knack for finding holes in them.</p>

<p>The bright side of all of this is that rust monsters can be a source of
residuum, that precious substance which is used to fuel magic rituals and
enchant items. You see, most of them can’t digest magic, so any magic
impregnating the metal they eat ends up stored in their bodies as clumps of
residuum. This is enough incentive for some people to go out hunting rust
monsters, despite the risks to life, limb, and loot.</p>

<p>Some rust monsters <em>are</em> able to digest residuum, which causes them to grow much
larger and to crave magic as much as they do metal. These enhanced monsters are
known as Dweomer Eaters.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-residuum">A Note on Residuum.</h3>

<p>Residuum gets introduced in the PHB, so I haven’t talked about it too much
here. It’s basically concentrated, crystalized magic: I imagine it as
rainbow-colored sparkly dust. The rules measure it by its monetary value (for
example, “100gp worth of residuum”), so I imagine it’s extremely valuable for
its weight and only found in tiny quantities.</p>

<p>When you disenchant a magic item using a ritual from the PHB, you get a fifth of
its monetary value back as residuum, which ensures you can always get some
benefit even from items no one in the party wants. The substance can be used in
place of the traditional components for any ritual, no matter what its power
source is. And of course, Enchant Item is a ritual, so you can use it to make
other magic items as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Most rust monsters are Medium Natural Beasts, though Dweomer Eaters are
Large. They have low-light vision.</p>

<p>In earlier editions rust monsters could destroy metal weapons, armor and items
instantaneously, but this has become a more gradual process in 4e. Even so the
MM2 has this big box about being careful with rust monsters, because players
loathe losing their magic loot even more than they fear losing their
PCs.</p>

<p>Usually, at most one of the party’s items risks total destruction at the
antennae of a rust monster per fight, though that danger multiplies if you’re
fighting more than one and the penalties it inflicts can make fighting the other
monsters in the encounter more difficult than they would otherwise be.</p>

<h3 id="rust-monster-both">Rust Monster (Both)</h3>

<p>Basic rust monsters are Level 6 Skirmishers with 66 HP. Their speed is 8, so you
can’t easily run from them once they catch the scent of your expensive gear.</p>

<p>A rust monster’s <strong>bite</strong> does physical damage and rusts any heavy armor the
target might be wearing. Rusting armor has a -1 penalty to AC, and multiple
bites increase this to a maximum of -5. This only lasts until the end of the
encounter.</p>

<p><strong>Rusting Defense</strong> means attacking the monster with a metal weapon also rusts
it, which inflicts a -1 penalty to attack rolls and is cumulative to a maximum
of -5.</p>

<p>Rusted weapons and armor return to normal after the end of the encounter, so
this is not quite as bad as it looks. However, the monster can target a rusting
weapon or suit of armor with its <strong>Devour Metal</strong> ability (melee 1 vs. Reflex),
which destroys the item in question on a hit!</p>

<p>If the destroyed item was magical, you’ll be able to retrieve residuum from the
monster’s belly equal to the full value of the item, which doesn’t necessarily
ensure you’ll get your item back but is still a bit of a consolation prize.</p>

<p>The main difference between books, aside from the usual damage update, is in how
Devour Metal works. The MM2 version only affects magic items of 10th level or
less (or nonmagic items), and is an encounter power. The MV version is actually
more dangerous: it has no level limit and recharges when the monster misses with
it, which means it can keep trying until it manages to destroy something.</p>

<p>Fighting a rust monster still produces that funny inversion effect where the
squishies wearing cloth and bearing wooden weapons move to the front line and
the fighters cower in the back, but now the fighters aren’t instantly doomed the
moment the monster slips by the squishies.</p>

<h3 id="gluttonous-rust-monster-mv">Gluttonous Rust Monster (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 8 Brute has 110 HP, Speed 6, and all the abilities of the basic rust
monster above.</p>

<p>In addition, it has a <strong>Gluttonous Bite</strong> encounter power (melee 1 vs. AC) which
does more damage than the basic bite and rusts the target’s weapon and armor at
the same time. On a miss, it does half damage.</p>

<h3 id="young-rust-monster-swarm-both">Young Rust Monster Swarm (Both)</h3>

<p>This is what you get when a couple of rust monsters nests close to a large
source of metal. The swarm is a Level 9 Soldier with 92 HP. As a swarm, it takes
half damage from single-target attacks and 10 extra damage from area effects. It
can also squeeze through any opening wide enough to allow a single rustling
through.</p>

<p>The swarm has <strong>Rusting Defense</strong> and its <strong>Swarm of Bites</strong> also rusts
armor. Its <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura 1 deals 5 damage to enemies caught inside and,
if they have a rusting item on them, slows them for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="dweomer-eater-mm2">Dweomer Eater (MM2)</h3>

<p>Dweomer Eaters are Large, and Level 11 Skirmishers with 110 HP. They work pretty
much like standard rust monsters, with bigger numbers. There is one important
difference, though: their rusting abilities target not metal, but <em>magic</em>.</p>

<p>This means that any magic armor or weapon used by the party, no matter what
material it’s made from, is at risk when fighting a dweomer eater. Mundane items
are fine, but that is scant consolation for a level 11 party typically clad in
+2 or +3 armor and weapons. Yes, if you hit them with spells channeled through a
magic implement, the implement rusts even if it’s made of wood or crystal.</p>

<p>You can still extract residuum equal in value to any items destroyed by a
dweomer eater from its corpse, at least.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The encounters we have in the MM2 place rust monsters alongside creatures which
don’t usually employ metal weapons, such as lizardfolk that fight unarmed or
with magic, and certain faeries. I don’t think you can train a rust monster not
to eat your metal weapons, so people who rely on steel won’t be using them as
pets.</p>

<p>I like rust monsters! The original versions terrified me as a player, but the
kinder implementation here feels just right. A single mistake won’t cost you
your hard-won loot, and the GM gets to have a bit more fun by prolonging the
dread.</p>

<p>PCs with Enchant Item can make magic items with a maximum level equal to their
own, so the residuum refund from a slain rust monster makes the loss of such an
item temporary. You usually find items of a higher level than that as treasure,
though. The Essentials rules also introduce the concept of item rarity, which
makes certain items impossible to re-create via ritual. Both of these things
mean some losses are indeed permanent or at least very difficult to replace.</p>

<p>I think rot harbingers first appeared in 3e as Angels of Decay, in one of its
undead-focused supplements. Here, they are only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In 4e, rot harbingers are still sometimes called angels of decay, though that’s
the less common name for them. Though they resemble angels, the two are not
directly related.</p>

<p>Rot harbingers are one a type of undead that were never alive in the first
place. Once upon a time Orcus decided to travel outside the Abyss for reasons
that have been lost to time. The gods took this opportunity to try and kill him,
and sent a host of angels to do the deed. The angels failed, and all of them
perished at the claws of the demon lord. When Orcus returned to the Abyss, he
made the first rot harbingers from nothing as a kind of “fuck you” to the gods
that tried to kill him.</p>

<p>Most such monsters still serve Orcus, but some have managed to escape his
control and find new employment with other masters. All of them are quite
unpleasant, with their lust for inflicting agony and death being literally the
thing that keeps them animate.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Rot harbingers are Medium Elemental Humanoids with the Undead keyword. They’re
immune to disease and poison, have 10 necrotic resistance, and aren’t specially
vulnerable to radiant energy. They run at speed 6 and fly at speed 8
(clumsy). We get two stat blocks here, and they’re simple enough that I’m not
going to give them their own sub-sections.</p>

<p>The standard <strong>Rot Harbinger</strong> is a level 20 soldier with 193 HP. It fights with
its claws, which mark for a turn and do ongoing necrotic damage (save ends) in
addition to their standard physical damage. That’s their only attack.</p>

<p>There’s also the <strong>Rot Slinger</strong>, which is level 22 Artillery and has 165
HP. Its claws also do ongoing necrotic damage, and it fights at range by
shooting Orbs of Decay (Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) which do necrotic damage,
weaken, and inflict a -2 penalty to saves (save ends both).</p>

<p>They’re best used in groups, with standard harbingers providing a serviceable
front line and the slingers hanging back. They pair well with monsters that
inflict (save ends) effects, due to the penalty they inflict.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h3>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 21: 1 deathpriest hierophant, 3 slaughter wights, and 2 rot harbingers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 2 harbingers, 2 slingers, and a voidsoul specter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, Thanatos is probably crawling with these things, and they make
perfect servants to high level necromancer types even if those necromancers
aren’t part of the Orcus franchise. They’re good candidates for the “regular
foot-soldier” monster in an all-undead epic adventure.</p>
