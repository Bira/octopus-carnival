<p>I believe the Neogi first appeared as an element of 2e’s Spelljammer setting. In
4e, they make their debut here in the MM2.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Neogi are bizarre-looking spider-centipede people who originally hail from the
Far Realm. Their culture is a particularly cruel and pitiless variety of
imperialist capitalism. Ownership is all - the strong rule and own the
weak. They organize themselves in clans with slavery-based internal
hierarchies. A given neogi literally owns their immediate underlings and is in
turn a slave to its immediate superior. This goes up all the way to the Great
Old Master of the clan, who is no one’s slave. Neogi are a single-gendered
species without any concept of family. All of the clan’s eggs are carried and
gestated by the Great Old Master.</p>

<p>Neogi are renowned both as traders and slavers, following the same school of
commerce made famous during Earth’s Age of “Discovery”. If the other party is
weaker than you, rob and enslave them. If they’re equivalent or stronger,
negotiate and trade. They just love trading with similarly unsavory people like
devils, duergar, and drow. The only ones they avoid are the mind flayers, since
the entire neogi people was once enslaved by entities similar to flayers back in
the Far Realm.</p>

<p>For some reason, the MM2 doesn’t mention any of their nautical proclivities. I
guess this part of the Astral Sea wasn’t quite as fixed in the authors’ minds
back them. But since later descriptions would reveal you can pretty much
transplant all of Spelljammer directly into the Astral Sea, you can bet you have
Neogi trade/slave/warships roaming that plane.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Neogi are Aberrant Magical Beasts. Most are Medium, but Masters are Large. Their
levels cover the first half of Paragon Tier, making them appropriate encounters
for the Underdark or Astral Sea. Like all monsters, their level can be adjusted
if you want to feature them earlier or later. They usually have climb speeds and
darkvision, and a degree of telepathy. They also speak Common and Deep
Speech.</p>

<p>All Neogi are immune to the Dazed condition. Their attacks are usually some sort
of psychic power, though the exact effects vary per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="neogi-slaver">Neogi Slaver</h3>

<p>A relatively “typical” individual, likely found as crew in an astral vessel or
as troops in raiding party. In either case, they’re likely to be accompanied by
plenty of non-neogi slaves. These are some of the few monsters in the book who
would make use of the “non-lethal takedown” rule, where you can decide someone
you took to 0 HP is not dead, just unconscious. After all, dead slaves are worth
nothing.</p>

<p>Slavers are Level 10 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 106 HP. They have a
ground speed of 8 and a climb speed of 6 with Spider Climb. Their basic melee
attack is a weak <strong>bite</strong> with an ongoing poison damage rider. The first failed
save against this poison also slows the victim (save ends both).</p>

<p>Their main ranged attack is a <strong>Charm Bolt</strong> that targets Will. Instead of
dealing damage, it inflicts a -2 penalty on any attacks that don’t include the
slaver as a target (save ends). After the first failed save, the slaver
also becomes invisible to the target of the bolt!</p>

<p>Their other attack is <strong>Psychic Shackle</strong> (Recharge 5+), a Close Blast 3 that
targets Will, deals psychic damage, and dazes those it hits for a turn.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, they can also use <strong>Thrall Goad</strong> as a minor action. This
allows all allies within 6 squares of the slaver to make a saving thrown with a
+5 bonus.</p>

<h3 id="neogi-spawn-swarm">Neogi Spawn Swarm</h3>

<p>Neogi larvae are tiny and sub-sapient. Their only desire is to eat all nearby
available meat, living or not. They can be dangerous in large numbers, which is
what this stat block represents.</p>

<p>The Swarm counts as a Medium Level 10 Brute with 131 HP. They have the standard
swarm resistance to melee and ranged attacks, and a vulnerability to close and
area attacks. Their ground and climb speeds are both 6.</p>

<p>Their Swarm Attack aura (1) deals automatic poison damage, and their <strong>bites</strong>
are similar to that of the neogi slaver but deal more damage. When first
bloodied or when slain, the swarm lets out a collective <strong>psychic scream</strong> that
attacls a close burst 1 and deals psychic damage with a Daze rider.</p>

<h3 id="neogi-great-old-master">Neogi Great Old Master</h3>

<p>These Large individuals rule over entire clans, and carry all of the clan’s eggs
and larval broods in their immense abdomens. They’re Level 16 Controllers with
157 HP, a ground speed of 6, and a climb speed of 4.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 3 <strong>Scythe Claw</strong> that damages targets and knocks
them prone. Their main ranged attack is an <strong>Enslaving Bolt</strong> that targets Will,
deals psychic damage and inflicts one of those progressively worsening
conditions. The immediate effect is that the target gets a -2 penalty to any
attacks that target the Master; after the first failed save, that worsens to a
Dominate effect; and after the second the domination lasts until the target’s
next extended rest. Yes, this does mean that an unlucky PC could find themselves
trying to avenge the Master even after it’s been killed by the party.</p>

<p>When the Master is first bloodied, its abdomen ruptures and releases a Larva
Burst. This works as a Close Burst 2 against Reflex that deals physical damage
and creates a zone of difficult terrain that lasts until the end of the
encounter. This could also be a good opportunity to introduce a Spawn Swarm to
the fight if the GM is feeling sadistic.</p>

<p>Finally, they can use a version of the Slaver’s Psychic Shackle that deals more
damage and has a wider area.</p>

<p>Myconids have been in the game since AD&amp;D as one of its most famous “novelty
humanoids”. They make their 4e debut here in the MM2.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Myconids are sapient fungal humanoids who originated in the Feywild. The
fomorians did <em>something</em> to them in the distant past, and they still bear the
scars of that corruption. In our narrative present they can be found in deep
caves or the Underdark both in the world and in the Feywild. Their preferred
environment are underground mushroom forests that provide them with a complete
ecosystem to live in, but they also have an instinctive need to multiply and
spread and so can be found in less ideal conditions as well.</p>

<p>Myconids communicate by releasing special spores laced with emotions and
sensations, which only other myconids can understand. Only one individual in
each of their colonies, known as the “Sovereign”, can communicate with outsiders
through telepathy.</p>

<p>These mushroom-people aren’t evil, but their expansionist instinct, difficulty
with communication, and the fact that they live in the friggin’ <em>Underdark</em>
means they tend to engage in conflict with anyone they come across. They often
end up enslaved by drow, fomorians, and shadar-kai.</p>

<p>Peaceful interaction with myconids is predictably hard - you have to reach the
sovereign, which means infiltrating the heart of their territory or letting
yourself be captured and hoping they take you there.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Myconids are Fey Humanoids with the Plant keyword. Sovereigns are Large,
everyone else is Medium. They have Tremorsense 10, which allows them to operate
well in total darkness. Their signature trait is <strong>Roots of the Colony</strong>, a free
action that triggers when they’re hit by an attack and allows them to split half
the damage between themselves and a myconid ally within 5 squares. Given they’re
level 3-4, this is likely to be the party’s first encounter with something
resistant to focus fire.</p>

<h3 id="myconid-rotpriest">Myconid Rotpriest</h3>

<p>Myconid culture isn’t well-understood enough for people to know if they worship
something, but rotpriests kinda fulfill the “healer” role usually taken up by
clerics in other species. They do so in a much more self-sacrificing way,
though.</p>

<p>Rotpriests are Level 3 Brutes with the Leader keyword and 48 HP. They have a
speed of 5, and Regeneration 5 that can be temporarily disabled by radiant
damage. They fight with <strong>stipe staffs</strong> in melee and can also release
<strong>decomposing sprays</strong> to deal necrotic damage in a Close Burst 3.</p>

<p>They have Roots of the Colony like every other myconid, and when another myconid
uses this ability to deal damage to them, rotpriests can use <strong>Sacrifice for the
Colony</strong> to take all of the damage from the trigerring attack instead of just
half. The idea is that they then heal this using their regeneration.</p>

<p>When they finally get killed, they release a <strong>Life Burst</strong> that heals every
living creature in a Close Burst 1 for 10 HP. This includes both monsters and
PCs!</p>

<h3 id="myconid-sovereign">Myconid Sovereign</h3>

<p>Each colony has one of these acting as its leader. As mentioned before,
sovereigns are the only myconids with any ability to communicate with
outsiders. They’re Level 4 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 58 HP. If
forced into a fight they can defend themselves with <strong>Slams</strong> and with a variety
of interesting spore bursts.</p>

<p>The default <strong>Spore Burst</strong> is a close blast 3 that targets the Will of
nonplants and deals poison damage. There’s also <strong>Commanding Spores</strong>, which
allows a plant ally within 5 squares to shift 1 square. Sounds like a waste of a
standard action, but it can set up some interesting flanks.</p>

<p>A Sovereign should stay a bit away from the main scrum, spraying it with its
spore pesticides and helping keep the PCs surrounded.</p>

<h3 id="myconid-guard">Myconid Guard</h3>

<p>Though it’s the last monster in the entry, guards are likely to be the most
numerous foes the party meets. They’re the rank and file of the colony’s
protectors. Guards are Level 4 Soldiers with 56 HP.</p>

<p>They fight with <strong>spiny strikes</strong> from their fists, and can release
<strong>pacification spores</strong> in a close burst 1 that target enemies’ Wills, do poison
damage, and prevent those hit from taking standard actions during their next
turns. Fortunately, this is only an encounter power. Roots of the Colony is the
last trick on their arsenal.</p>

<p>Front-liners are going to have a bit of a bad time facing down myconid guards,
since the guards can stagger their spore releases to keep the PCs from attacking
for a while.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Myconids can live in any place that provides good conditions to mundane fungi,
such as damp caverns, surface forests, and so on. Encounters with them can
involve any wildlife that also lives in these places, either as “third parties”
or perhaps as pets if the wildlife is also fungal. They can also be found
alongside the several people who enslave their colonies, though in that case you
might need to perform some level adjustments.</p>

<p>The sample encounters are an all-myconid party that has just ran into a
deathjump spider (level 3); a pair of myconid guards minding an arbalester for
their bosses near a patch of green slime (level 4); and a geonid accompanied by
a pair of rust monsters and another of rotpriests (level 5).</p>

<p>I like these mushroom people, and I like making then relatively friendly once
the PCs manage to breach the communications gap.</p>

<p>Fourth edition Maruts debuted in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/07/03/marut.html">first Monster Manual</a>, as enigmatic
mercenaries from the Astral Sea that demanded future favors as payment for their
services and kept detailed ledgers of these in their astral fortresses. Here we
get a bit more lore about them, and three new stat blocks to go with the two
from the first MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The MM2 bits of lore seem to have been written by a different author from the
first, and this second author seems to have time-traveled from 3e or 2e. It
talks a lot about Maruts being interested in “the upholding of oaths and
contracts” in the abstract, which doesn’t really match the first book. Yes,
they’re very interested in this stuff, but only when the oaths made <em>by them</em> or
<em>to them</em>.</p>

<p>There’s also another bit that says they consider themselves to be “astral
spirits of the air”, and despite the convoluted justification accompanying this
I don’t think the Astral Sea is a place with strong elemental associations
either way.</p>

<p>A more interesting bit is the one that says Maruts aren’t an unified block -
they’re divided into groups called “cadres” that hold slighty different
philosophies. Each cadre has their own fortress and interacts with other
sapients in more or less the same way, but I guess they differ in what they’re
stockpiling those favors for.</p>

<p>Some cadres have started calling in a few of their favors and demanding periods
of indentured servitude from people. Maruts don’t mistreat their servants, but
they’re still demanding and humorless bosses.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The Maruts in this entry are Medium Immortal Humanoids. They have Truesight out
to 10 squares, a ground speed of 8, and flight and teleport speeds of 4. They’re
immune to sleep and have Resist Thunder 10.</p>

<p>All of the stat blocks in this entry are described as “hunting down those who
oppose marut law”, which again doesn’t quite make sense. Pretty much every Marut
will hunt and fight someone who backed out of a deal with them, so instead of
repeating this I’ll speculate about what someone might hire these new varieties
for.</p>

<h3 id="marut-castigator">Marut Castigator</h3>

<p>Castigators make good bounty hunters, since they’re good at preventing their
target from running away. They’re Level 21 Skirmishers with 146 HP and all
standard traits. They wield a double sword in combat, and have access to thunder
and lightning-themed magic.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>double sword</strong> attack can deal physical or lightning damage, at
the marut’s discretion. They can also make <strong>Double Attacks</strong> with it, but not
all the time (recharge 4+).</p>

<p>To prevent someone from running, they can use the <strong>Punisher’s Lash</strong>, a Reach 2
vs. Reflex spell that deals weak lightning damage, slows, and prevents the
target from teleporting for a turn. If the target still tries to run, they can
give chase with a <strong>Thunderbolt Strike</strong>, which allows them to teleport 4
squares and make a basic attack with bonus damage afterwards. This recharges
when they hit with the two strikes from a double attack.</p>

<h3 id="marut-prosecutor">Marut Prosecutor</h3>

<p>Objection! Prosecutors are probably pretty good at that very role during an
actual trial, with their epic levels of Insight and Intimidate. They can also
use magic to infuse their words with the leaden weight of the law.</p>

<p>Prosecutors are Level 21 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 147 HP. They
can punch people with <strong>slams</strong> that do bonus thunder damage and slow (save
ends), but their judicial magic is their greatest asset.</p>

<p>As a minor action they can issue a <strong>Dictum</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) that
does no damage and immobilizes (save ends). They can also use a minor action to
mark someone with a <strong>Sigil of Indictment</strong>  (ranged 10 vs. Will), which also
does no damage but forces the marked victim to grant combat advantage to the
prosecutor and take 5 extra psychic damage from all attacks directed at it. This
lasts for a turn and can be sustained, but only one target can bear the Sigil at
a time.</p>

<p>Finally, the prosecutor can take a bit more time and spend a standard action to
harangue someone with a <strong>Biting Testimony</strong> (close burst 10, targets one enemy,
vs. Will). This deals psychic damage, and inflicts a -2 penalty on all of the
target’s attacks, skill checks, and ability checks (save ends).</p>

<p>All of this means prosecutors call the shots during a fight, marking someone
with the Sigil and having their allies focus fire on the victim, which they’ll
try to immobilize with Dictums. Dictums can also be used to prevent defenders
from helping a focused squishy. “Close Burst X; targets one enemy” is just a
terse way of saying that power is a ranged attack that doesn’t draw OAs.</p>

<h3 id="marut-executioner">Marut Executioner</h3>

<p>An executioner is who you call when you need an obstacle removed. When they’re
not doing that, they’re out collecting debts owed to their cadre.</p>

<p>Executioners are Level 22 Brutes with 205 HP. They wield <strong>Double Axes</strong> that
does bonus thunder damage, knocks prone on a critical, and can be used in
several other maneuvers. <strong>Slayer’s Fury</strong> (encounter) allows them to attack
everyone in a Close Burst 1; <strong>Warranted Stroke</strong> targets a bloodied enemy, does
a ton of damage, always knocks prone, and gives the executioner 1 action point
if it drops the target to 0 HP or less.</p>

<p>They can also issue an <strong>Execution Call</strong> once per encounter, a Close Blast 5
that targets enemies’ Fortitude, does thunder damage, and pulls them adjacent to
the executioner. A miss here still does half damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like the mechanics of these new Maruts, but I dislike the throwback to 3e lore
here. Law is not a universal cosmic principle in 4e!</p>

<p>The sample encounters have marut mercenary squads accompanying a djinn (level
21) or a trio of rakshasa knights (level 23).</p>

<p>Cribbing from paleonthology is one of the classic ways to add interesting
monsters to your D&amp;D world. Dinosaurs are the obvious choice, but there’s also a
bunch of post-dinosaur megafauna that can be slotted in with no problem at
all. Among that set, mammoths are some of the most famous.</p>

<p>Looks like the Monster Manual 2 only had one page to dedicate to them, though,
so it decided to skip mundane mammoths altogether and give us a fantastical
variety.</p>

<h2 id="nyfellar-mammoth">Nyfellar Mammoth</h2>

<p>These creatures are native to Nyfell, the same frozen realm in the Elemental
Chaos from which frost giants originally came. They’re partially made of ice,
and subsist on a combination of organic food and ice, so they thrive in the most
inhospitable frozen hells.</p>

<p>Frost giants have long ago tamed Nyfellar mammoths for use as mounts, and were
responsible for bringing them to the world, where they can still be seen filling
that role. I imagine it’s also possible to find wild specimens.</p>

<p>Nyfellar Mammoths are Huge Elemental Beasts with the Mount keyword, and Level 17
Brutes with 202 HP. They have Resist Cold 10 and a respectable ground speed of 8
with Ice Walk, which allows them to ignore “icy” difficult terrain.</p>

<p>They also possess the same <strong>Icebound Footing</strong> trait that’s common among frost
giants, reducing any forced movement inflicted on them by 2 squares, and getting
a free save to avoid being knocked prone. They fight with their tusks and big
feet in combat.</p>

<p>The tusks are Reach 2 and can either <strong>gore</strong> as a basic attack or perform a
<strong>Tusk Toss</strong> (recharge 4+) that targets Fortitude, does a little less damage
and slides the target 5 squares. At the end of the slide the target falls from a
height of 30 feet on the destination square, so it really is a toss. The fall
does damage (and can be mitigated) according to the standard rules for falling.</p>

<p>The feet can <strong>stamp</strong>, a Reach 1 attack that targets fortitude, does about same
damage as a gore, and knocks prone. The mammoth can also execute a <strong>Blizzard
Trample</strong> maneuver to move 8 squares, go through enemy spaces, and stamp each of
those enemies. This recharges when the mammoth is bloodied, or when it takes
cold damage.</p>

<p>If used as a mount, the mammoth can employ a <strong>Bitterwind Charge</strong>, which allows
it to use a Tusk Toss <em>or a Blizzard Trample</em> when charging. Yeah, it moves 8
squares then tramples for another 8 in a single standard action. After this
special attack concludes, the rider gets to make a free melee basic attack.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is a level 17 frost giant patrol, with 2 giants riding
nyfellar mammoths and accompanied by a rimefire griffon acting as a spotter. The
book notes that giants like to play badminton with PCs by readying actions to
attack victims of Tusk Toss as they fly by.</p>

<p>These ice mammoths are pretty cool, and I can see why they preferred to include
them over the mundane variety. They have a good synergy with frost giants, which
also debut in this book.</p>

<p>You could pretty easily derive a mundane mammoth from the nyfellar stat block,
making it level 10-13 and removing some of the more blatant elemental
abilities. Maybe they could be used as hill giant or ogre mounts then.</p>

            <p>Gaming Ballistic is about to launch a campaign for the Nordlond Bestiary, and
you can go to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamingballistic/nordlond-bestiary-and-enemies-book">this page</a> to click a button and be notified of when that
happens. Everyone always says GURPS really needs a good bestiary. Well, here’s
one!</p>

<p>Contributing to Kickstarter campaigns is a bit hard for me, as my bank dislikes
it and tries to cancel my credit card whenever I do it. But if that’s not a
problem for you, by all means click that button. I’ll be here waiting for the
book’s final launch to buy myself a copy in the traditional way :).</p>
