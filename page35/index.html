<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Horses are a real-world animal, so you likely have a good idea of what they’re
like. They’ve been in the game since the very beginning, and here they have
their own entry in the MM and are part of the animal appendix on the MV.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>They’re horses! Herbivore ungulates widely used as mounts and beasts of burden
by any society that managed to develop animal domestication. You can still find
wild herds running through the plains of the world and the Feywild, but most
horses the PCs are likely to meet in their adventures will be acting as
someone’s mount.</p>

<p>Unlike in the real world, horses are far from the only choice of mount for your
typical D&amp;D society. There are plenty of other, more fantastic beasts that can
do the job just as well. If that job is “war mount”, they can likely do it
better. Yeah, warhorses are still a thing here, but the same amount of work that
goes into training one can instead get you a dire boar, hippogriff, or some kind
of drake. I think this is the first setting I see where a warhorse is the animal
you ride into combat when nothing better is available.</p>

<p>There’s a breed of horse that’s a potential exception to this: the celestial
charger, which is infused with divine energy and typically used as mounts only
by noble warriors and champions of justice. A Paladin PC might get one of these
as a reward for service to their kingdom, for example. They’re much more
powerful and intelligent than a typical horse, though they’re still animals.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Horses are Large Natural Beasts with the Mount keyword. They have low-light
vision, trained Perception and high ground speeds. We get three different stat
blocks.</p>

<h3 id="riding-horse-mm">Riding Horse (MM)</h3>

<p>These are meant for transportation, not battle, and are as close to a
non-combatant as you can be while still having a stat block. They’re here
because they’re likely to be the first rides your PCs get in their adventuring
careers.</p>

<p>They’re Level 1 Brutes with 36 HP and can run at speed 10. Their usual strategy
when in combat is to run away! Their only attack is a basic Kick they’ll only
employ when trapped or startled. The only reason these aren’t minions it’s
because have your horse one-shotted out from under you is no fun.</p>

<h3 id="warhorse-mm">Warhorse (MM)</h3>

<p>A larger, stronger horse trained to be ridden into combat and fight alongside
its rider.</p>

<p>It’s a Level 3 Brute with 58 HP and a ground speed of 8. Its basic attack is
still a Kick, but it can also Trample. We saw this one before: it allows the
warhorse to move its speed, go through enemy spaces (while drawing opportunity
attacks) and make an attack against any enemy whose space it crosses. This
attack is a bit stronger than the kick, and knocks prone on a hit.</p>

<p>Warhorses also have a Charger passive trait, which gives their riders a +5
damage bonus on charges.</p>

<h3 id="horse-mv">Horse (MV)</h3>

<p>The “generic” horse in the MV animal appendix is actually an updated
warhorse despite being a Level 1 Brute with 36 HP. The damage of its attacks has
been fixed, so they’re actually stronger than the MM warhorse’s despite the
lower level. The Charger trait is still here, though it only gives a +3 damage
bonus in this version.</p>

<h3 id="celestial-charger-mm">Celestial Charger (MM)</h3>

<p>Celestial Chargers are Large Immortal Beasts with the Mount keyword, instead of
being Natural like other horses. They’re Level 10 Soldiers with 111 HP, a +5
bonus to saves against fear, and Speed 8.</p>

<p>Celestial chargers kick and trample like warhorses, though their damage could
use a serious boost. They have two supernatural passive traits: Zephyr Footing
allows them to ignore all difficult terrain and move across any solid or liquid
surface; and Celestial Charge gives a +2d6 radiant damage bonus to their rider’s
charges.</p>

<p>I think these might be like the magic horses from Krull, or Gandalf’s Shadowfax.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>No sample encounters here, but as I said almost any sapient humanoid could be
found riding horses.</p>

<p>I would normally say you gotta have horses in your medieval-ish setting, but
we’ve seen so many other awesome mounts already that I think they might actually
be somewhat redundant. A setting with no horses but all sorts of other mounts
might look a bit like Final Fantasy. A few other possibilities present
themselves as well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The setting has no horses and everyone uses other mounts, but then it gets
invaded by an interdimensional army and the invaders use horses, which would
make <em>them</em> the exotic and alien mount.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The setting has no <em>mundane</em> horses, but one or more gods send celestial
chargers to their chosen champions as a sign of their favor. They’re seen as
this powerful divine beast without an eartlhy equivalent, in another neat role
inversion.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hook horrors definitely look like something that’s been around since AD&amp;D. My
first contact with them was in Neverwinter Nights, which used a model for them
that was nearly identical to that of vrock demons. The chunky fellow above is
quite different from those and much easier to tell apart. They’re only on the
MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Hook horrors are yet another example of predatory Underdark wildlife, adapted to
hunt in total darkness by clinging to a cave ceiling and dropping on its
victims. Unlike a lot of other Underdark wildlife we’ve seen so far, they’re
Natural, not Aberrant, which means they evolved down there on their own instead
of immigrating from the Far Realm.</p>

<p>Hook horrors are omnivorous, but prefer meat and are rumored to like drow meat
more than other kinds. They live in total darkness and use echolocation to
perceive their surroundings, though they have functional eyes to see in brighter
environments. The clicking noises they make are also used for communication, and
smart explorers can listen for those to see if hook horrors are nearby.</p>

<p>A group of hook horrors is called a “clan”, and is led by its strongest
egg-laying female. It ranges widely in the Underdark, with its members forming
smaller packs to hunt. Drow tend to kill adult hook horrors on sight and steal
their eggs to raise the hatchlings as attack animals.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>There’s only one stat block, so we’ll get right on it. Hook Horrors are Large
Natural Beasts, and Level 13 Soldiers with 137 HP. They have Blindsight 10 to
represent their echolocation, and a relatively slow ground speed 4. They can
also climb at speed 4.</p>

<p>Their basic attack uses those hooked forelimbs, dealing damage and pulling the
target 1 square on a hit. They can choose to attack twice at a -2 penalty to
each attack, and if both hit they deal some extra damage and grab the target
until escape. They can keep making hook attacks against grabbed victims, and can
also bite them as a minor action (which does slightly less damage).</p>

<p>They can also use their hooks to Fling a target. The book doesn’t say whether
this only works on a grabbed target or on anyone. It’s an attack vs. Fortitude
that rercharges on a 6, does more damage than the basic hook attack, slides the
target 3 squares, and knocks them prone.</p>

<p>I imagine you can make different hook horrors by giving them the same blindsight
as this one and a few hook-based attacks that do different things.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13, a balhannoth and 3 hook horrors. Looks like the ninja slug is
opportunistically following the horrors around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13, a hook horror, 2 grimlock berserkers and 1 beholder eye of
flame. A beholder and its retinue.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m indifferent to hook horrors. I suppose a large variety of Underdark
predators is good, but since they all fulfill more or less the same dramatic
role they tend to leave me cold.</p>

            <p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>I think Homunculi are derived from a medieval alchemy concept, and I’m pretty
sure they’ve been in the game since AD&amp;D. Here they appear only in the Monster
Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In my post on Helmed Horrors I compared construct creators to real-world
programmers. Let’s stretch the analogy a bit further: if golems and greater
helmed horrors are big packages of enterprise software, then homunculi are shell
scripts.</p>

<p>These minor constructs are built for the exact same purposes as their beefier
relatives: to act as tireless guardians, servants, and muscle. Being low-level,
I imagine they’re a lot easier to create, and their programming includes some
“shortcuts” that make them particularly adept at a specific kind of guard job.</p>

<p>Mentally, they’re pretty much like golems: they can understand even complex
instructions from their masters perfectly, and execute them without much thought
of self-preservation unless specifically ordered to avoid taking damage. Unlike
golems, though, ownership of an homunculus can be transferred to someone else
with a simple order (“this person is your master now”). This means they’ll often
be found in the service of someone who isn’t their creator.</p>

<p>So a low-level aspiring golem maker can have homunculi as servants, and
higher-level casters who would use actual golems as personal guards can
mass-produce homunculi and assign them to their underlings. The relative
weakness of an homunculus is actually an asset here! If those pesky organic
underlings start getting rebelious ideas, your personal guard-bot can easily
squash them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three quite diverse stat blocks here. They’re all Natural Animates with
the Construct and Homunculus keywords, training in Perception, darkvision, and
immunity to disease and poison. Everything else is variable.</p>

<p>Different types of homunculus gain special bonuses when tasked to guard a
person, object or area. For rules purposes, objects can weight up to 50 pounds
and areas can be up to 5 squares on a side. We’ll see why in a minute.</p>

<h3 id="clay-scout">Clay Scout</h3>

<figure class=left>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-clay-scout.png"/>
  <figcaption>Illustration Copyright 2008 Wizards of the Coast.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This Small homunculus is probably the one closest to the classic myth. It’s used
for, well, scouting, or for guarding small objects. I imagine it makes an
adequate menial lab assistant if well-managed.</p>

<p>Clay scouts are Level 2 Lurkers with 31 HP and all common homunculus
traits. They’re also trained in Stealth, and can run at speed 6 or fly at speed
3 (clumsy).</p>

<p>Scouts attack with a weak venomous bite that allows a secondary attack against
Fortitude, which slows on a hit (save ends). They can attack at range using a
Mind Touch (Ranged 10 vs. Will) which does adequate psychic damage and dazes
(save ends). Mind Touch is clearly their main attack, with the bite being more
of an emergency measure.</p>

<p>When targeted by a melee or ranged attack, they can use Redirect as an
interrupt. This target’s the attackers Will, and on a success forces them to
redirect their attack to an adjacent creature of the homunculus’ choice. Tricky!</p>

<p>They cap things off with a couple of interesting passive traits: clay scouts are
invisible to dazed creatures and, if tasked to guard an object, gain a +4 to
attack anyone adjacent to or carrying that object.</p>

<p>I think they’d mostly use their attacks to prevent pursuit in case they’re
discovered spying on you. They’re big enough to carry most objects they could be
set to guard, too. This is the construct you use when you want to carry
something to the ends of the earth so it’s never found again.</p>

<p>A metal guard dog, for when drakes aren’t enough but you don’t have the budget
for a shield guardian. It’s a Level 3 Soldier with 47 HP and all common
homunculus traits. It runs with speed 6.</p>

<p>It attacks by biting, and if tasked to guard a creature it can bite anyone who
attacks that creature as a reaction. It can also shift 1 square before or after
making opportunity attacks.</p>

<h3 id="iron-cobra">Iron Cobra</h3>

<figure class=left>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-iron-cobra.png"/>
  <figcaption>Illustration Copyright 2008 Wizards of the Coast.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>An homunculus named for its shape, not its role. As far as homunculi go, this is
a high-end model.</p>

<p>It’s a Level 6 Skirmisher with 75 HP and all common homunculus traits. It
slithers with speed 7, and can shift 3 squares as a move action.</p>

<p>They attack with a venomous bite that also does 5 ongoing poison damage (save
ends), and it can poison its enemies’ minds as well.</p>

<p>Poison the Mind (Ranged 10 vs. Will; recharge 3-6) is an attack that can only
target creatures suffering ongoing poison damage. The cobra’s bite is an obvious
source of this, but if other venomous creatures are part of the same encounter
their attacks also count. A hit dazes and slows the target (save ends).</p>

<p>When set to guard an area, iron cobras can use Poison the Mind without
restriction against any creature inside that area. This means the attack
effectively becomes at-will, and can target anyone in the area even if they
aren’t taking poison damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 9: 2 iron cobras, 2 snaketongue warriors, and 1
snaketongue assassin. As expected, iron cobras are a hit with snake fanatics
everywhere!</p>

<p>I think homunculi fulfill a necessary role for GMs who want to pit their PCs
against constructs from an early point in the campaing. As we’ve seen already,
golems and other similar constructs are usually too powerful to be fought by
early-heroic tier characters.</p>

<p>I also like that their existence allows for that “construct-making as a parody
of the tech industry” setting element I’ve been thinking about.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>I first remember seeing Helmed Horrors in Neverwinter Nights, which used the 3e
rule set. It’s quite possible they’ve been in the game since AD&amp;D, though. Here,
they’re only on the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Helmed Horrors are one of the many constructs-that-are-not-golems. They’re
created by means of an ancient ritual just like golems, but have several
practical differences.</p>

<p>First, the ratio of matter to elemental energy is different. The physical body
of a helmed horror is a suit of plate armor, not a solid statue. This suit is
filled with a much greater amount of energy pulled from the Elemental Chaos,
enough to give the horror a coruscating aura and to infuse its weapon attacks
with elemental damage. This also gives them the ability to regenerate.</p>

<p>Mentally, Helmed Horrors are smarter and have a bit more personality, though
they’re still completely loyal to their creators. They can speak, and they have
excellent senses (including both darkvision and truesight). They’re typically
given greatswords as weapons, and are used for much the same purposes as a
golem: guardians, bodyguards, or remorseless muscle.</p>

<p>Given their greatly enhanced senses and their trained skills, I imagine it’s
also possible for a helmed horror to be used as a bounty hunter or city guard,
possibly accompanied by organics who handle the more delicate social tasks.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two helmed horror stat blocks here. Both are Medium Elemental Animates
(constructs) with training in Perception and Insight, plus Darkvision and
Truesight. They speak Common and Primordial, and have human-level intelligence
(one has 10, the other 12).</p>

<p>Helmed Horrors are immune to charm, disease, fear, poison and sleep, a greater
suite of immunities than even some golems get. They also have varying levels of
Regeneration and the ability to fly at the same speed they walk, though they do
so clumsily.</p>

<h3 id="helmed-horror">Helmed Horror</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 13 Soldier with 131 HP and all common traits
above. Its regeneration is 5, and its speed is 6 both on the ground and in the
air.</p>

<p>The horror’s Elemental Greatsword does a mix of physical damage and one of cold,
fire, lightning or thunder, chosen before each attack is rolled. Its damage is
“naturalistic”, but the bonus elemental damage manages to get to just a couple
of points less than its correct value.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the horror can perform a Blade Sweep to attack two different
targets, and it has a Tactical Step ability that allows it to shift 2 squares
when it hits with an opportunity attack.</p>

<h3 id="greater-helmed-horror">Greater Helmed Horror</h3>

<p>This is a Level 18 Elite Soldier with 348 HP, which at first glance looks like
it puts it on a roughly even footing with stone or iron golems. However, that’s
not quite true.</p>

<p>The Greater Helmed Horror is basically a leveled-up version of the basic
model. Its Regeneration is 10, its speed 8 in all movement modes, its Tactical
Step shifts it 3 squares instead of 2.</p>

<p>It still gets only one greatsword attack, which due to “naturalistic” design
only does 1 point of damage more than the basic model’s. It can also do a Blade
Sweep, but still only once per encounter.</p>

<p>It does get a new attack in the form of Elemental Burst (Close Burst 5
vs. Reflex; Recharge 5-6), which does a bit less damage than the sword and has
the same damage type options.</p>

<p>Greater Helmed Horrors require a bit more work to bring up to the standards of
the new math - their damage needs a boost, and I’d also make their Blade Sweep
an at-will action. <em>That</em> would put them in the same footing as a golem.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get one sample encounter here. Level 14, 2 helmed horrors, 1 mummy lord and 3
firelasher elementals. I’m guessing the mummy was the thing’s original creator,
and summoned the elementals too.</p>

<p>We’ve already seen at least three different “families” of constructs that are
created via ancient rituals and end up getting used for roughly the same
purposes: golems, guardians, and helmed horrors. That makes me think of a
setting where construct-making spellcasters are a bit like programmers. Each
follows a specific school of thought and employs a different “language”, and
they bicker constantly about whose is best. And unlike real-world programmers,
these people can have their creations beat each other up when their arguments
get really heated.</p>

<p>D&amp;D Harpies are inspired by the harpies from Greek mythology, with a bit of
siren mixed in. They’ve been in the game since pretty much the beginning. Here,
they are on the Monster Manual only.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In ancient times there was an evil elf witch queen. She and her unscrupulous
children often took the form of golden eagles to spy on their subjects. A mighty
hero defeated them and drove them into exile, breaking the queen’s magic crown
in the process. It was the crown that gave them the power to change shape, and
when it broke the evil family became stuck as part-bird, part-elf beings. These
were the first harpies.</p>

<p>Modern harpies roost in dismal places where few others can live: swamps,
badlands, ruins, coastal cliffs. They fly out to hunt or to attack travelers,
pacifying their victims with their magic-imbued songs and tearing them apart
with their claws.</p>

<p>Both male and female harpies exist, but they usually only spend enough time
together to produce a batch of eggs. Once the female lays her eggs, the male
takes off. Because of this is quite rare for PCs to find a mixed-gender group of
harpies.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Harpies are Medium Fey Humanoids and have human-level intelligence. This means
there’s nothing stopping your setting from containing settlements of unaligned
or friendly harpies, but the ones we get here are Evil bandit-types.</p>

<p>Harpies walk with speed 6 and fly with speed 8 (clumsy), which means they mostly
fight on the ground when using their claws, or from some high perch when using
their ranged special powers. If you want them to be better fliers, removing the
Clumsy keyword is a good start.</p>

<p>Unlike the elves they used to be, harpies have no special ability to see in the
dark.</p>

<h3 id="harpy">Harpy</h3>

<p>The classic model is a Level 6 Controller with 71 HP and the common traits
listed above. It also has Resist 10 Thunder.</p>

<p>Harpies fight in melee with their claws, and prefer to do so from the ground
since they’re clumsy fliers.</p>

<p>Their main special ability is the afore-mentioned <strong>Alluring Song</strong> (Close Burst
10 vs. Will), which can affect any non-deaf enemy in range. A hit pulls the
target 3 squares and immobilizes them (save ends). The harpy can use a minor
action in subsequent turns to sustain the power and pull anyone who hasn’t saved
yet another 3 squares.</p>

<p>Once their enemies are all nice and bunched up, the harpy can let loose a
<strong>Deadly Screech</strong> (Close Burst 4 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6), which does
thunder damage and dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>Both of the harpy’s damaging attacks are in serious need of a damage
boost. This, and removing the Clumsy keyword from their flight speed, should be
enough to bring them up to MV standards. The Alluring Song is particularly
dangerous in a battlefield full of cliffs or other hazards.</p>

<h3 id="bloodfire-harpy">Bloodfire Harpy</h3>

<p>This one doesn’t bother with nice songs, it just kills you with fire.</p>

<p>A Bloodfire Harpy is a Level 9 Soldier with 100 HP. It has Resist 10 Fire and
sings a Burning Song (aura 20) that slowly boils the blood of anyone in range
who can hear it, dealing 5 fire damage at the start of their turns.</p>

<p>This harpy also fights with claws, which are red-hot and do a mix of physical
and fire damage. It can also disgorge a Cloud of Ash (Close Blast 3
vs. Fortitude; recharge 4-6) which does fire damage and blinds (save ends).</p>

<p>These fiery things could use the same damage boost as the basic model, but they
work fine otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Judging by the sample encounters in the book, harpies tend to keep some fine
company:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 3 harpies, 2 spined devils. They have a lot in common when you think
about it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 1 bloodfire harpy, 3 gnoll marauders, 2 cacklefiend hyenas. Just a
bunch of bros hanging out, doing some light pillaging and burning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 2 harpies, 1 sahuagin priest, 3 sahuagin raiders. Better plug your
crew’s ears before you get too close to <em>this</em> reef.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I like harpies! Mythological monsters are always fun, and these ones have some
interesting song effects. It’s also not too hard to come up with new varieties,
like a skirmisher harpy with better agility and Flyby Attack, or one that can
put people to sleep with their song.</p>
