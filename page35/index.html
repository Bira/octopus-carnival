          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/11/22/goncharov.html">Shadowrun: Goncharov</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I’ve recently read about a fun Tumblr meme. It’s about Goncharov, a 1973 Martin
Scorcese movie that never existed.</p>

<p>It began when someone posted a picture of these bootleg boots they bought
somewhere. The brand label had one of those word salads copied from somewhere
and edited by someone not too familiar with the target language. In this case,
it was copied from a poster for Gomorrah, a real movie. And it read “Martin
Scorcese presents Goncharov”.</p>

<p>Tumblr <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/hussyknee/701454778540146688/im-so-confused-rn-can-you-explain-the-goncharov">kinda ran with it</a>, so now you have a lot of people making things up
about the movie and fabricating screenshots, posters, bits of soundtrack,
talking about all of this as if it was a real cinematic masterpiece.</p>

<p>Someone in a Discord server I frequent suggested Goncharov should become a
standard name for someone who doesn’t exist, the opposite of John Doe. And this
got me thinking about Shadowrun again. Here are two uses for the name Goncharov
in a Shadowrun-like setting.</p>

<h2 id="the-mundane">The Mundane</h2>

<p>In Shadowrun, “Mr. Johnson” is shadowrunner slang for a person who hires
shadowrunners. The stereotypical Mr. Johnson is a shady fuck in a suit who talks
in vague businesslike terms<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but it can be anyone who is willing to be the
“client” for a runner group. That’s an established part of the game already.</p>

<p>So how about we say Goncharov is the “reverse” term? Goncharov is Johnson code
for shadowrunners! Sure “shadowrunners” is canon and also works well, but you
can’t really write “shadowrunner payoff” in your official corporate ledger, can
you? So instead you write “payment to Goncharov for services rendered”.</p>

<p>And just like no self-respecting mysterious client calls themselves Mr. Johnson,
no self-respecting runner calls themselves Goncharov. Someone who takes that as
their handle or even as an alias is telling the whole world they’re a clueless
poser.</p>

<p>This little bit of culture works well in the Shadowrun setting itself, and on
any other setting that has stylish urban mercenaries as characters, including a
lot of GURPS Action or GURPS Cyberpunk campaigns.</p>

<h2 id="the-numinous">The Numinous</h2>

<p>Let’s go a bit further, shall we? Here’s a mystical explanation that’s a bit
more mystical than even Shadowrun’s default setting allows for<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and is a bit
closer to Exalted’s take on spirits and magic.</p>

<p>Goncharov is the Small God of Shadowrunners. He started out as an abstraction,
as above, but at some point became a real part of shadowrunning culture. Either
an existing spirit took on the mantle, or folk belief made him real.</p>

<p><em>Real</em> runners, those who are more than amoral assholes doing horrible things
for money, they have an understanding with Goncharov. They never forget the
corps and the big syndicates are the enemy even when circumstances force them to
work for these groups. They never sell out. They know who their community and
friends are, and they look out for them. And after every successful job, they
give Goncharov his cut.</p>

<p>Goncharov looks like a fit but somewhat scuffed up man in a nice but somewhat
scuffed up suit. The details vary, but he never looks overly fancy or
arrogant. In other words, he might look like John Wick after a fight or three,
but never like the Continental Hotel guy - that’s the god of Mr. Johnsons.</p>

<p>Magicians can take Goncharov as a mentor spirit. He provides bonuses to combat
spells and Spirits of Man, whatever form those bonuses take in your edition of
choice. Non-magicians can also have “an understanding” with him for a slightly
cheaper price. This gives them access to the Goncharov’s Cut rule.</p>

<h3 id="goncharovs-cut">Goncharov’s Cut</h3>

<p>Those who have an understanding with the god of Shadowrunners, and keep to his
code, can gain extra Karma for giving him his cut. This includes magicians who
take him as a mentor spirit, or any character who spends points to buy a
slightly cheaper Edge representing the covenant.</p>

<p>If you’re using the Karma for Cash rule in your game, such characters gain an
extra point of Karma when using the rule, if they would already gain at least
one point normally.</p>

<p>If that’s not a general campaign rule, such characters still gain access to it,
becoming able to exchange money for a single point of Karma after every run.</p>

<p>In both cases the money goes to support and improve the runner’s community, or
to help out fellow shadowrunners in need.</p>

<h3 id="in-gurps">In GURPS</h3>

<p>In a GURPS Action or Cyberpunk campaign with supernatural elements, The
Understanding is a -10-point Code of Honor, since it’s informal but applies to
interactions with people who are not your peers. Give Goncharov his cut and use
it to support your community and fellow runners; hunt down and punish any who
betray them<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>; never sell out; even if you need to do a job for a corp or a
crime syndicate, never forget they’re the enemy.</p>

<p>This code can work as a “pact” limitation for supernatural or cinematic traits
related to being stealthy, discreet, or good at combat (yes, even Gunslinger or
a talent like Smooth Operator). It would provide a 10% discount on their price,
as normal, and would make these abilities unavailable until atonement if the PC
breaks the attached code.</p>

<p>The monetary value of Goncharov’s cut is 10% of any earnings from
“shadowrun”-like missions. GMs and players who don’t want to bother with
accounting can just remove it from the PC when it’s given, and assume it gets
spent properly. In games where more detailed tracking is important, the PC
doesn’t need to spend the money immediately, just set it aside for use when
necessary. Using it for personal benefit after it’s been set aside is a
violation of the Code, though. If the protected community has its own
organization stats, the player might want to consider transferring this money
from the PC to the organization.</p>

<p>Following the code might also lead to acquiring traits such as positive
reputation among your community or fellow runners, or Enemies in the form of
traitorous villains and amoral mercenaries who think you’re weak for having a
conscience.</p>

<p>Atonement from breaking the code usually takes the form of a dangerous mission
to aid an oppressed community or fellow runner in trouble.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Yetis are inspired by real world folklore and I’m sure they showed up in a
previous edition of D&amp;D before. This seems to be their 4e debut.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>D&amp;D yeti are borderline-sapient predators adapted to live in permafrost covered
mountains. While they usually feed on other mountain-dwelling animals, they’re
more than powerful and ferocious enough to attack people, and so everyone who
lives near their habitat knows they exist. Learning how to recognize signs of
yeti presence and avoid the creatures is probably a standard part of mountain
survival training.</p>

<p>Yetis have a well-developed sense of smell and can track prey across great
distances. They hate the smell of rotting flesh, however, so leaving decomposed
animal carcasses around an area can serve to keep them away. Herders also know
to pay attention to their animals: if they grow too agitated for no apparent
reason, it might be because they’ve sensed an approaching yeti.</p>

<p>A yeti relies on its powerful muscles, sharp claws, and magic-enhanced howls to
kill its prey. They don’t really have any sort of technology or a complex
society, but they live in bands and work very well together. They’re smart
enough to avoid large, well-armed expeditions, but they’ll be on top of any
isolated stragglers before you can say “Look out, a yeti!”.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Yeti are Medium Natural Beasts with Speed 6, Ice Walk, Resist 5 Cold and
Low-Light Vision. Their signature encounter power is their <strong>Fearsome Howl</strong>, a
Close Blast 4 vs. Will that deals psychic damage and pushes 3 squares.</p>

<p>All of the entries here have <strong>claws</strong> as their basic attacks. These don’t have
any riders and are always underpowered for their level, which means they’ll use
their other attacks as much as possible. Their other attacks also tend to have
low-ish damage, but have interesting riders. They have an Int between 9 and 11
while still counting as Beasts, which is why I said “borderline sapient” above.</p>

<p>Yeti encounters will most often be against an all-yeti group, as they don’t
really ally with anyone or keep pets. For variety, you can add other
opportunistic predators, or maybe a wild cold elemental or two. Also, these
encounters are all pretty much guaranteed to take place in treacherous frozen
mountain paths full of ice-based difficult terrain and hazards like tall cliffs
and snow-covered sinkholes. Every yeti has at least one forced-movement power
available to it (Fearsome Howl), so they’re likely to be more dangerous than
their stats alone indicate.</p>

<h3 id="yeti-hunter">Yeti Hunter</h3>

<p>Your typical roaming yeti, whose howls can be heard from miles away but don’t
really give away their position because of the way sound echoes in the
mountains. It’s a level 3 Soldier with 49 HP.</p>

<p>The hunter’s claw attack will probably only feature as part of a <strong>Twin Claw
Grab</strong>, which lets it make two attacks and grab the target if both hit. It
doesn’t have any special abilities to exploit a grab, but the basic rules still
apply. Its marking abilities are a ranged <strong>How of Challenge</strong> that deals
psychic damage and marks for a turn, and a close burst <strong>Call for Blood</strong> that
deals more psychic damage and marks everyone it hits (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="yeti-howler">Yeti Howler</h3>

<p>A yeti whose magic howls are more powerful than usual. Some stories say they’re
the embodiment of angry ghosts, howling against the injustice of their premature
deaths. They’re Level 4 Controllers with 58 HP.</p>

<p>The howler’s <strong>Chilling Wail</strong> acts as an aura (3) that deals 5 psychic damage
and imposes a -2 defense penalty for a turn against any enemy who ends their
turn inside. This actually brings its melee damage up to par, with a little
extra aimed at the other PCs inside the aura. If you try to stay away from it,
the howler will bombard you with <strong>Hurled Boulders</strong> that work like ranged area
attacks dealing physical damage.</p>

<p>In addition to their Fearsome Howl, howlers can also emit a <strong>Piercing Shriek</strong>
once per encounter. This ranged attack deals thunder damage, and if the target
ends their next turn within 5 squares of the yeti they take another 5 thunder
damage.</p>

<h3 id="yeti-rampager">Yeti Rampager</h3>

<p>This one is angrier than usual, with a more mobile fighting style. It’s a Level
5 Skirmisher with 67 HP. They have a Speed of 7.</p>

<p>Rampagers love to charge, so they’ll try to make space for those charges as
often as possible. They’ll pick a target and use their <strong>Battle Howl</strong> against
it, a ranged attack that deals psychic damage and lets them charge as a free
action on a hit. They can also just charge normally instead, if they’re not
confident of hitting the target with the howl. In either case their <strong>Furious
Charger</strong> trait gives them +5 bonus damage on charges.</p>

<p>If they’re surrounded by melee PCs, howlers can use Furious Howl or <strong>Trample</strong>
to get away. That last ability lets them shift their speed and make a melee
attack that damages and knocks prone on a hit against any enemies whose spaces
they move through during the shift.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Yeti are interesting mechanically, but they require a bit more thought on the
part of the GM to ensure they’re dealing level appropriate damage. None of them
are the type to stand still and spam basic attacks.</p>

<p>Lore-wise, I don’t see much wrong with their lore. They’re described as
dangerous predators, and the word “savage” doesn’t appear even once in this
entry. The biggest criticism I can make is that yetis are so iconic outside D&amp;D
that facing one feels kinda “mundane” when compared to some of the other
monsters available. That’s just a personal taste thing, though.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t be hard to use these stat blocks for a sapient and friendlier yeti
if that’s how you want them to be in your campaign.</p>

<p>I’m sure xivorts appeared in a previous edition, but here they get some new
4e-specific lore.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Xivorts are a tragic threat. They are descended from gnomes enslaved by
fomorians and subjected to all sorts of tortures and experiments. Their long
captivity in the Feydark caused them to mutate into their present cave-adapted
state, which was further exacerbated when most of them were freed from their
captors by a cabal of night hags and brought to the Shadowfell.</p>

<p>The hags were only interested in liberating the xivorts as a way to deal a blow
to their fomorian masters, so they just left the former gnomes to their own
devices in the Shadowfell. These newly freed xivorts had only known torment and
suffering all their lives, so they set about dealing that to others.</p>

<p>As usual I’m not fond of painting a whole sapient species with such a broad
negative brush, so I want to say xivorts are just people and you can find whole
communities of non-evil individuals out there. The ones you end up fighting
might still fit the description here, though.</p>

<p>For good or ill, xivorts tend to associate with dark ones and gnomes. They have
a particular distrust of larger people, an echo of the hatred they hold for
fomorians. Goliaths and half-orcs tend to be priority targets in combat
encounters because of this.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Xivorts are Small Fey Humanoids with a Speed of 5 and Darkvison. Their signature
ability is <strong>Shadow Step</strong>, which triggers whenever an adjacent enemy hits
them. It allows the xivort to teleport 2 squares to another space adjacent to
the enemy.</p>

<p>All of the entries here are level 1 or 2, which makes me think they’re meant to
be novel kobold and goblin replacements.</p>

<h3 id="xivort-slasher">Xivort Slasher</h3>

<p>This is a “slasher” in the horror movie sense. It fights because it likes to
inflict pain. As a Level 1 Skirmisher with 26 HP, it’s not a big threat to a
trained adventurer, but from the point of view of a non-combatant it could look
like an unstoppable killer.</p>

<p>The slasher fights with a <strong>short sword</strong> in melee and throws <strong>daggers</strong> at
range. Besides the standard Shadow Step it has <strong>Cunning Step</strong>, which allows it
to shift 1 square when an enemy adjacent to it is hit by an attack. This doesn’t
have to be one of the slasher’s own attacks, it can be anything.</p>

<p>If several slashers gang up on a single enemy, that enemy will soon find
themselves surrounded by them.</p>

<h3 id="xivort-darter">Xivort Darter</h3>

<p>This one fights using concealable thrown darts, a tradition dating back to the
xivort’s time as Fomorian captives. It’s Level 1 Artillery with 22 HP.</p>

<p>Both the xivort’s <strong>Dagger</strong> and its <strong>Darts</strong> are a bit weak, but it can use
<strong>Dart Volley</strong> to make two ranged attacks in the same action. Once per
encounter it can throw its special <strong>Dream Venom Dart</strong>, which does the same
damage as a basic one and dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>All of the darter’s ranged attacks target <em>Reflex</em>, not AC, making it
particularly effective against heavily armored defenders.</p>

<p>Instead of the usual Shadow Step, the darter has <strong>Darter’s Step</strong>, which
works the same but doesn’t restrict its teleport destination. It’s meant to let
them get away from melee.</p>

<h3 id="xivort-net-caster">Xivort Net Caster</h3>

<p>This one is trained to bring larger foes down so they’re easier to kill. It’s a
Level 1 Controller with 26 HP.</p>

<p>The net caster can use a non-damaging <strong>net</strong> as a ranged area attack to
restrain everyone it hits (save ends). If someone escapes the net it can throw a
pair of non-damaging <strong>bolas</strong> as a minor action to knock them prone and prevent
them from getting up for a turn. Then it moves in with its <strong>short sword</strong>,
which deals bonus damage against prone, immobilized, restrained or sloweed
enemies.</p>

<p>All of the status effects the net caster inflict make the target grant combat
advantage, so they go really well with monsters that can exploit that.</p>

<h3 id="xivort-shadow-caller">Xivort Shadow Caller</h3>

<p>A spellcaster using the ‘mysteeeerious’ Shadow source, who apparently traded
part of their soul to the Shadowfell itself in exchange for power. It’s Level 2
Artillery with the Leader keyword.</p>

<p>Shadow callers user <strong>daggers</strong> in melee, but like most artillery they want to
stay further away and use their ranged spells. <strong>Shadow Phantoms</strong> is their
basic ranged attack, dealing psychic damage and making the target grant combat
advantage for a turn. This has an extra +1 to hit for every creature adjacent to
the target, be it ally or enemy.</p>

<p><strong>Deathmark Bolt</strong> (recharge 5+) deals necrotic damage and lets an ally of the
caster make a free melee basic attack against the target. And <strong>Shadow
Strangler</strong> (encounter) is a “pseudo-summon” that immobilizes and inflicts
ongoing 5 necrotic damage (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>As far as low-level enemies go, they’re… okay I guess? Fighting these guys
instead of kobolds is a nice change of pace, but I’ll confess I lose a bit of
enthusiasm for them when I realize they’re another attempt to hype up the Shadow
power source.</p>

<p>I believe wilden are new to 4e, first appearing in the Player’s Handbook 3 as an
option for PCs. This is their corresponding Monster Manual entry.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Wilden are the middle world’s immune response to the Far Realm. They appeared
very recently, emerging from the Feywild’s deepest and most untouched natural
environments. Theoretically, that’s a reaction to an upsurge in Far Realm
activity in the world, and it’s worrying that the signs of that haven’t been
noticed by anyone else yet.</p>

<p>Not even the wilden themselves have a clear idea of what caused them to
emerge. The setting’s youngest sapient people by far, they have an instinctual
drive to protect nature and oppose aberrant creatures, but they have yet to form
a unified culture and traditions of their own. Most individuals turn to other
creatures around them for examples. For many, those come from more established
fey peoples like elves, eladrin, and gnomes. Others turn to the beasts of the
wild, or to more zealous spirits like dryads and treants, and end up much
fiercer and much less sociable. Some even fall in with evil fey like fomorians,
ending up as villainous as them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Wilden are Medium Fey Humanoids with a speed of 6 and low-light vision. As PCs,
their gimmick is that they may assume one of three <em>aspects</em> after an extended
rest, each of which changes their appearance a bit and gives them a different
racial power.</p>

<p>Each of the three stat blocks in this entry belongs to a single aspect and
carries that aspect’s related power, in a version stronger than what’s available
to PCs. They’re Unaligned and may represent allies, neutrals, or hostiles as
your story requires.</p>

<p>They’re all in the low-heroic range, which means you can find NPC wilden in the
same areas where you’d find NPC elves and gnomes. They often use wolves, spiders
and drakes as pets, and there are many such creatures that would be
level-appropriate for a wilden encounter.</p>

<h3 id="wilden-destroyer">Wilden Destroyer</h3>

<p>Wildens who adopt the aspect of the Destroyer are usually the designated
warriors of their communities. They wield large carved wooden clubs, and every
time they survive a battle they add a new carving to their weapons to celebrate
it.</p>

<p>Destroyers are Level 2 Soldiers with 39 HP. Their carved <strong>greatclubs</strong> damage
and mark for a turn on a hit, and they can throw <strong>handaxes</strong> as basic ranged
attacks. If an enemy marked by the destroyer tries to ignore the mark, the
destroyer gains a +4 bonus to attack and damage that enemy during their next
turn. If a bloodied enemy attacks the destroyer or one of the destroyer’s
adjacent allies, it can use the <strong>Wrath of the Destroyer</strong> encounter power to
attack that enemy as a reaction. If this hits, the enemy becomes stunned for a
turn.</p>

<p>PC Wildens in Destroyer aspect can use that power too, though for them it dazes
instead of stunning.</p>

<h3 id="wilden-hunter">Wilden Hunter</h3>

<p>Wilden who adopt the Hunter aspect fulfill that role in their community, and
also make for excellent scouts. They are Level 2 Lurkers with 33 HP. They fight
with <strong>shortswords</strong> and <strong>longbows</strong> that just make basic attacks. All their
interesting stuff is in their passive traits and their racial power.</p>

<p>The passives are familiar to us by now: <strong>Camouflage</strong> allows them to make
Stealth checks with only partial cover and concealment; <strong>Sniper</strong> lets them
stay hidden when they miss with a ranged attack from hiding; and <strong>Hidden Shot</strong>
lets them deal extra damage when they attack from hiding.</p>

<p>Their encounter power is <strong>Pursuit of the Hunter</strong>, which triggers when an enemy
ends their movement within 2 squares of the hunter. The hunter can react by
shifting 3 squares, and for their next turn they will deal 5 extra damage with
their attacks against that enemy, and will also ignore partial cover and
concealment against them.</p>

<p>PC Wilden in the Hunter aspect get a similar Pursuit power, except it deals 1d6
extra damage instead of the fixed 5.</p>

<h3 id="wilden-ancient">Wilden Ancient</h3>

<p>Wilden who adopt the aspect of the Ancients are their community’s shamans and
guides. They’re called “Ancients” because their magic lets them cast their minds
to the collective history of the Feywild and the world. When they go into these
trances, their whole community stops to take care of them and await their
awakening, which might bring important insights or prophecies with it.</p>

<p>The Ancient depicted here is Level 4 Artillery with 45 HP and the Leader
tag. It’s a primal spellcaster who fights with a <strong>spear</strong> and with several
combat spells. Their spear attacks are very weak but allow an ally adjacent to
the target to make a free melee basic attack at +4 to hit.</p>

<p>Their combat spells have varied effects: <strong>Spectral Vine</strong> is a basic ranged
attack that deals physical damage and pulls 2 squares; <strong>Rumbling Earth</strong>
(recharge 5+) is a ranged area attack that damages and immobilizes (save ends);
and <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> (encounter) is a ranged area attack that does heavy
lightning damage, half on a miss.</p>

<p>Once per round as a minor action they can impart the <strong>Wisdom of the Ancients</strong>,
granting them a +2 attack bonus for their next turn. And then they hit an enemy
with an area attack, they can use their <strong>Voyage of the Ancients</strong> encounter
power to teleport 3 squares and make one of the enemies they just hit grant
combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>Despite their many controllery effects, it makes sense for Ancients to be
artillery. They want to stay safe behind a wall of bodyguards and bombard their
enemies, not mix it up in melee like a controller might want to do.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I gotta say it feels a bit odd to find a low-heroic entry right after the
high-epic Weavers, but that’s just a product of the book being in alphabetic
order.</p>

<p>Wildens are serviceable enough as low-heroic enemies, about in line with what I
expect from an entry dedicated to a creature that’s also a PC option.</p>

<p>Weavers have apparently been around since the days of AD&amp;D, appearing in a
Monstrous Compendium Annual there under the name “Spell Weavers”. Their 4e debut
was actually in Dungeon #165, in the adventure titled “Secrets of the White
Lotus Academy”. Here in the MM3 they get updated into a major cosmic threat.</p>

<p>As an aside, it was in a weaver ruin that Kyuss found the writings that let him
become the Worm that Walks, back in the 3e adventure path.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Weaver civilization is incredibly ancient, and what little remains of it seems
to have been somehow shattered and spread across the cosmos. Records recovered
from these few ruins seem to describe a terrible Far Realm incursion that tried
to inject a seed of chaos into our cosmos. The Weavers tried to stop this, and
were only partially successful. This is what shattered them.</p>

<p>To hear the Weavers themselves tell it, their civilization predated even the
gods and primordials, and the event that caused its destruction was in fact what
caused the universe to separate into the Elemental Chaos and the Astral
Sea. Contemporary sages don’t believe this to be true, but the surviving Weavers
certainly do. This belief is at the root of their disdain for all things
divine. To them, the gods are just annoying upstarts. Their own bodies and minds
are the product of aeons of transhuman enhancement. They’re much stronger,
faster, and smarter than your average mortal, and possess an unparalleled
multitasking ability that lets them even cast multiple complex spells at once.</p>

<p>Present-day Weavers preserve as much of their ancient lore as they can, and work
on a grand plan to rebuild their civilization by undoing the planar disjunction
that broke it. Yes, they want to smush the planes back together. If they’re
right, it will be a very bad time for everyone else in the universe. If they’re
wrong, it will be a bad time for absolutely everyone, including themselves.</p>

<p>Their plan has two parts. The first is to restore and repair as many weaver
ruins as possible. Within each one is a planar portal that links all active
ruins into a single network, and a mystical furnace that burns the life force of
mortals and the enchantments that power magic items. By feeding these furnaces,
weavers gather power for the series of rituals that will finally accomplish
their goal.</p>

<p>A weaver will be most likely be found masterminding some plan to gather powerful
mortal souls and magic items. They drain this power through enchanted chromatic
disks that only work for weavers. Every individual carries one of these, though
they specialize in different “flavors” of soul.</p>

<p>Weavers easily form alliances with other powerful groups that have the same
negative opinion of the gods and a nihilistic bent, like tulgars and the
Forsaken. They also hold great influence over the Nerra, leading some scholars
to say the creation story in that entry is wrong and the Nerra are actually
creations of the Weavers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Weavers are Medium Immortal Humanoids. They have Darkvision, a ground speed of
6, and a teleport speed of 6. Their signature trait is <strong>Multitasking Brain</strong>,
which limits the effect of the dazed condition on them: they only lose their
move action, and can still take immediate actions (like interrupts and
reactions).</p>

<p>The other signature trait is more of a design directive: most of a weaver’s
attacks are minor actions, and they’re about as effective as a standard action
from another monster would be. They’re also all Elites.</p>

<p>Each weaver statted below specializes in collecting the souls of characters who
employ a different power source, using that same power source as its main
weapon. There’s one for every power source except divine, whom they consider
beneath them even as fuel for their furnaces. Ironically, this means divine
characters have a bit of an advantage over weavers.</p>

<h3 id="spell-weaver">Spell Weaver</h3>

<p>The classic model, concerned with the collection of arcane power. Spell weavers
usually lead raids into secure locations in order to steal magic itens and
particularly desirable souls. They’re planned months in advance with intel from
spies and divinations, and usually involve the opening of a long-distance portal
as close to the target as possible. Once the spell weaver has what it wants, it
teleports back to the portal and escapes. It’s Level 28 Elite Artillery with 400
HP. Yes, according to this entry the typical weaver is equivalent to a demigod
in power.</p>

<p>They have three basic attacks, all doable as minor actions: <strong>Esoteric Touch</strong>
deals force damage and pushes 5 squares; <strong>Dimensional Ray</strong> allows the weaver
to teleport 2 squares before rolling, deals untyped damage, and teleports the
target 2 squares; and <strong>Esoteric Blast</strong> deals fire damage to its target and an
automatic 10 fire damage to all enemies adjacent to it.</p>

<p>Also as a minor action, it can wield its chromatic disk and cast <strong>Extract
Arcane Soul</strong> (recharge 5+). This can only target characters with arcane
powers. It deals psychic damage and dazes (save ends). On a miss it deals half
damage. Hit or miss, the weaver regains 20 HP. So this doesn’t extract your
whole soul, just a bit of your life force. It’s still bad news!</p>

<p>They also have a standard action attack: <strong>Chilling Echo</strong> can be used to
automatically deal 15 cold damage to all creatures the spell weaver has damaged
since the start of its current turn.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, when the weaver takes damage, it can use <strong>Defensive Jaunt</strong>
as a reaction, becoming invisible and teleporting 20 squares.</p>

<p>The spell weaver’s minor action attacks deal about half the damage you would
expect from the MM3 formula, but the addition of Chilling Echo brings them back
up to their expected potential. Don’t forget to use it!</p>

<h3 id="battleweaver">Battleweaver</h3>

<p>Possibly some of the best warriors in the universe, battleweavers wield 4
exquisitely-crafted swords in combat, and hold their chromatic disk in their
other two hands. They collect the life force of worthy warriors. Battleweavers
are Level 26 Elite Soldiers with 488 HP.</p>

<p>It’s imposssible to duel a battleweaver and come out unscathed, because their
<strong>Blade Mastery</strong> acts as an aura (1) that deals 10 automatic damage to any
enemies inside and marks them for a turn when this happens.</p>

<p>They have a standard <strong>longsword</strong> basic attack, but they’re usually going to
open with one of their two minor-action maneuvers, which also count as basic
attacks. <strong>Quick Jab</strong> deals light physical damage and slides the target 3
squares to a space adjacent to the weaver; <strong>sidestep jab</strong> does the same damage
and allows the weaver to shift 3 squares to a space adjacent to the
target. Combined, they allow the creature to lead its foes on a merry dance
across the field. The basic attack can then act as a “finisher” in the round,
bringing their damage potential to a level a bit above the one expected by the
formula.</p>

<p>Battleweavers can use their chromatic disk to <strong>Extract a Martial Soul</strong>,
targetting characters with martial powers. This is like the spellweaver’s
version: it deals psychic damage, dazes (save ends), and heals the weaver for
about 5% of its total HP (24 in this case).</p>

<p>If an enemy marked by the battleweaver within 10 squares makes an attack that
doesn’t include the weaver as a target, the weaver can teleport to the enemy and
make a melee basic attack against it, as an interrupt. This is the other main
use of their standard-action basic attack.</p>

<p>Battleweavers will use their “jab” strikes to wander around the battlefield and
disrupt PC formations while their aura damages and marks enemies. Like a
swordmage, it will try to stay far away from enemies it has marked, to increase
the chances of their mark triggering. It will use its stronger longsword attacks
to punish mark-ignoring PCs or to pile on more damage on a target it wants to
focus.</p>

<h3 id="thought-weaver">Thought Weaver</h3>

<p>A weaver that specializes in the power of the mind. It usually doesn’t go out
hunting like the others - instead it can be found in weaver ruins working to
restore their gates and furnaces. If forced to fight, it will do so entirely
through the use of psionic powers, barely moving unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Thought weavers are Level 27 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 500
HP. Their basic attacks are minor actions:: <strong>Quick Strike</strong> is a standard melee
attack, and <strong>Mind Spike</strong> is a ranged attack that deals psychic damage,
inflicts a -2 penalty to all defenses for a turn, and slides the target 3
squares. They can also <strong>Extract A Psionic Soul</strong>, targetting a PC with psionic
powers with the same standard Extract Soul effects. As standard actions, it can
use two powerful mind control techniques:</p>

<p><strong>Mental Puppet</strong> is a non-damaging attack that slides the target 5 squares,
forces them to make a basic attack against a target of the weaver’s choice, and
then dominates it (save ends). It recharges when no one is dominated by the
power.</p>

<p><strong>Command the Puppet</strong> automatically hits someone dominated by Mental Puppet. It
deals psychic damage and has the same rider as the other power (slide 5 squares,
make a basic attack).</p>

<p>If someone leaves a square adjacent to the dominated puppet, the weaver can use
<strong>Guardian Puppet</strong> as an interrupt to have the dominated character use a basic
attack against the triggering enemy.</p>

<p>Tought weavers can also choose to spend a standard, move, or minor action
directing a <strong>Coordinated Strike</strong>, which essentially gifts the spent action to
an ally within 5 squares and allows the ally to immediately take that action.</p>

<h3 id="hex-weaver">Hex Weaver</h3>

<p>This is the weaver attuned to the Shadow power source. And what is the Shadow
power source? As far as I know it’s basically “Arcane in a Halloween
costume”. It started getting mentions as something distinct around this time,
and would get a supplement all to itself named Heroes of Shadow the next year.
To my knowledge it never got very popular due to this conceptual confusion with
arcane magic and due to most of its associated classes not being very
good. Anyway, it got a weaver here.</p>

<p>Hex Weavers are too cool to hang out with other weavers, and instead oversee
portals into the Shadowfell from which they launch expeditions to pursue
mysterious goals that may or may not be related to the overall plan of the
weaver civilization.</p>

<p>A Hex Weaver is a Level 27 Elite Lurker with 382 HP, and it’s also too cool to
follow the same rules as the other weavers. Its minor action attacks are
<strong>Extract Shadow Soul</strong>, which has the usual effects but only targets creatures
with shadow powers, and <strong>Shrouded Eye</strong>, a ranged attack that deals psychic
damage and makes the weaver invisible to the target for a turn. The latter can
only be used once per round, which breaks from the pattern.</p>

<p>This is also the weaver with the highest number of standard action powers:
<strong>Shadow Grasp</strong> is a stronger, melee version of Shrouded Eye; <strong>Stinging
Shroud</strong> is a close burst 1 that deals necrotic damage and is much stronger
against creatures granting combat advantage to the weaver. And <strong>Shadow Mask</strong>
is an encounter power that makes it invisible for a turn.</p>

<p>Finally, if the weaver is damaged, it can <strong>Step Into Shadow</strong> (recharge 4+) to
become insubstantial for a turn and teleport its speed as a reaction.</p>

<p>Hex weavers are a bit disappointing. They’d be a lot more dangerous if Shadow
Mask was a recharge or at-will power, or if Shadow Grasp was a minor
action. They also had the problem that there weren’t a lot of shadow-based PCs
around when they were published, because Heroes of Shadow was like six months
away from its release.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m not familiar with weavers from previous editions but I really like their
lore here. The targetting restrictions on their Extract Soul attack do feel a
little artificial, but are easily removed. I don’t like the shadow power source
very much, so I didn’t like Hex Weavers, but the others are quite flavorful and
powerful.</p>
