<p>Luskan is a coastal city a ways north of Neverwinter. In the games, it was a
pirate and thief-infested cesspool secretly ruled by a cabal of evil
wizards. The evil wizards were defeated in a novel before the start of the
events in this book, so now it’s just exactly what it always appeared to be.</p>

<p>The Dead Rats are currently the most successful thieves’ guild in Luskan. They
have this name because their senior members are wererats, and their initiation
ceremony involves a ritual that imparts some wererat powers to the
initiate. Their leader is a halfling bard named Toytere, also known as “King
Toy”, who seems to have the power to see the future and uses it to foil the many
assassination attempts made on him.</p>

<p>A PC with this background used to be an average member of the Rats until they
were brought in before King Toy, who proclaimed the PC was destined to lead a
mutiny against him and ordered their execution. This was news to the PC, who
barely made it out of the room alive and managed to abscond to Neverwinter.</p>

<p>Their original goal here was to build enough wealth and power to return to
Luskan and take revenge on those who wronged them, but this might have changed
by the time the campaign starts.</p>

<p>Dead Rat Deserter PCs are usually shifty and shady types, though they’re loyal
to their friends (who include the other PCs). While rogues are the first to come
to mind, there aren’t any class restrictions. Characters should be either
humans, half-elves, or halflings, since those are the majority ancestries in
Luskan and make up all of the Dead Rat membership.</p>

<p>The background skills for this theme are Intimidate, Stealth, and Thievery.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>You don’t need a theme just to make a shifty character with a shady criminal
past, so why choose this one? Because it also lets you be a <em>wererat</em>!</p>

<p>The level 1 feature is <strong>Body of the Rat</strong>, an 1/round minor-action at-will
power that lets the PC assume the form of a Tiny rat. The same power also lets
them change back, and whenever they change shape they can also shift 1
square. In rat form, the PC can’t attack but gains a climb speed equal to half
their ground speed and a +4 to Stealth checks. The PC’s equipment melds into the
rat form, and continues to provide all of its passive benefits. There are a few
exceptions: they don’t get AC bonuses from shields, can’t use active item
powers, and can’t access any containers (like bags or potion vials). On the
other hand, their equipment can’t be removed in any way while it’s part of the
rat form.</p>

<p>At level 5, the PC gains a +2 power bonus to Stealth and Bluff. This is useful
for a rogue-type, but would be much better if it was untyped.</p>

<p>At Level 10, <strong>Hybrid Bite</strong> lets the PC assume the classic hybrid wererat
form. Changing back and forth is an at-will minor action, like above, and the
character retains all their equipment and can use it normally. The hybrid form
has the same size as the character. The character also gains a bite attack. The
attack bonus for this is (STR or DEX modifier)+4, and the damage is 1d8+(same
modifier) plus 5 ongoing damage (save ends). The bonus increases to +6 and the
damage to 2d8 at level 21.</p>

<p>This attack is a little underwhelming, I think. If Strength or Dexterity is your
main attack stat, it’s going to be about on par with a +2 weapon with a +2
proficiency bonus, which means it’s less accurate than the characters’s actual
main weapon if any of those stats are better on it. Ongoing damage on an at-will
is good, but also maybe not as good as the bonuses of a level 10’s character
main weapon and class powers. If you use anything other than STR or DEX to
attack, this power is useless.</p>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>The optional powers here are all about tapping into your inner rat.</p>

<p><strong>Savage Hiss</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that helps intimidate enemies in a
fight. When the PC scores a critical hit, they can use this power to inflict
every enemy within 5 squares with a -4 penalty to attack the PC for a turn.</p>

<p><strong>Dead Rat Stealth</strong> is a level 6 daily power that takes a minor action and
gives the PC a +2 power bonus to Stealth and Thievery for the rest of the
encounter. If the PC dislikes a roll for one of these skills, they can end the
effect and reroll it with a +5 power bonus.</p>

<p><strong>Intuitive Leap</strong> is a Level 10 daily power that represents the PC inheriting
some of King Toy’s prophetic abilities. The PC can use it when it’s time to roll
initiative, gaining a +4 power bonus to the roll and being able to stand up or
move their speed for free at that point.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Mechanically, this theme suits high-Dex characters the best, since it boosts
Stealth and Thievery and might let a character who lacks both to get access to
one of them. Being able to turn into a normal-looking rat can enable <em>all sorts</em>
of shenanigans, especially out of combat, but the hybrid form and bite attack
are of dubious utility at best. This is not a theme that will do a lot to boost
your damage output.</p>

<p>Story-wise, I haven’t gotten far enough into the book to see whether Luskan and
the Rats influence Neverwinter in any significant way. It’s possible a Rat would
just be along for the ride if they’re the only one in the party. An <em>all-Rat</em>
party would result in a significantly different path than those implied by the
other paths we saw so far. They all got set up together and would still retain
their goal of getting rich and powerful enough to return and get some revenge,
likely causing a lot of chaos in Neverwinter in the process.</p>

<p>From what I remember, the Harpers used to be a “good conspiracy” back the “old
days” of the Forgotten Realms. A secret society dedicated to doing good,
fighting for freedom, and keeping the many evil factions of the setting in
check. Elminster was a big fan, and several of the setting’s iconic NPCs were
members.</p>

<p>Those Harpers got destroyed during the Spellplague, but sixty years before our
narrative present a new group took up the name. This incarnation of the group is
mostly focused on stopping the machinations of those Netheril survivors who came
out of the Shadowfell, though they also have their fingers in other pies.</p>

<p>A PC with this background has a very specific and rather tense backstory. They
always dreamed of joining the Harpers, and traveled to Everlund to apply. They
were given a trial mission - to go to Neverwinter and link up with a woman named
Cymril. Cymril was not only a fully-fledged Harper Agent but also the leader of
the Sons of Alagondar. The Sons are a group of rebels who opposes Dagult
Neverember, and who fight for an independent Neverwinter.</p>

<p>The PC gets included in night-time recon mission led by Cymril herself, and
their group gets ambushed by a force of Neverember’s mercs. In panic, the PC
hides, and then gets to witness as the rebels are massacred. The thing is,
Cymril herself turned coat as soon as the fight started, and began killing her
own underlings! In the end, the hidden PC is the only survivor on the rebel
side: Cymril gets taken out by one of her lieutenants, who in turn dies to the
mercenaries. They leave the rebels’ bodies on the street as a warning. Our PC as
the foresight to steal Cymril’s Harper pin before absconding.</p>

<p>So the title of “Harper Agent” is kind of misleading. The PC is actually a
<em>rogue</em> agent, sympathetic to the organization’s ideals but operating without
their official support. The PC can’t let it become known that they’re not a real
Harper, and even without that secret coming out they’re already facing suspicion
from the very rebel group they were supposed to help, for being the only
survivor of the ambush that killed Cymril.</p>

<p>A PC with this background wishes to discover the truth behind that massacre,
prove their innocence, and fulfill their original mission of preventing
Neverember from becoming the cutthroat merchant-king he wishes to be. This theme
brings even more intrigue and spy games into the game than the Neverwinter
Noble.</p>

<p>There are no class or race prerequisites, though the book recommends Harper
characters be good at subterfuge and say many of them multiclass into bard,
rogue, ranger or wizard.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>This class gains only a single feature: that Harper Pin pried from Cymril’s
corpse. It marks the bearer as a member of the Harpers, brings with it a
blessing from one of their patron goddesses, and can be used as a key to secret
Harper hideouts and caches.</p>

<p>Mechanically, it’s a Rare Level 3 Wondrous Item, which means it doesn’t take up
any slots and can’t be bought in stores. The PC chooses one of three possible
blessings at character creation, and this becomes the pin’s item encounter
power. <strong>Llira’s Grace</strong> lets them roll 1d6 and add it to an attack roll they
just missed, potentially turning it into a hit. <strong>Mielikki’s Endurance</strong> lets
them reduce incoming damage from an attack by 5 + half level. And <strong>Tymora’s
Luck</strong> lets them re-roll a save with a +2 bonus to the new roll.</p>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>This class’s optional utility powers continue to follow the themes of the divine
blessings above.</p>

<p><strong>Harper’s Healing Boon</strong> is a level 2 daily power that can be used as an
interrupt when the PC is hit by an attack. They take only half damage from the
attack and can immediately roll a save.</p>

<p><strong>Unexpected Ally</strong> is a level 6 power that represents the PC use fast-talk to
trick an enemy into believing the PC is a secret ally of theirs. This means the
enemy can’t make opportunity attacks against the PC and grants combat advantage
to them. The effect ends when the PC attacks the fooled enemy.</p>

<p><strong>Resourceful Dastard</strong> (yes, with a D) is a level 10 daily power. It’s a stance
that gives +4 to all defenses when the PC has cover or concealment, and lets
them ignore all difficult terrain when shifting.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>This theme is very strongly oriented towards rogue, bard, or even ranger PCs, I
feel. Its blessing and utility power can help make these characters less fragile
and more mobile.</p>

<p>A criticism I’d make is that this one is a lot less generic than the other
themes we saw so far. With a background like that, it’s a bit hard to make the
PC anything other than a rogue Harper in the Neverwinter region of the Forgotten
Realms. It’s also almost impossible to have more than one Harper Agent in a
party unless you change that very detailed background and come up with another
reason why they can’t contact out-of-town Harpers for support.</p>

<p>A Harper Agent in a party has reasons to cozy up to and aid the Neverwinter
Noble, and provides a good hook for the GM to introduce the group to the Sons of
Alagondar (or what’s left of them). Cooperation would not be automatic, since
the Sons distrust the Harper, but it would be a start. The Agent would also try
to convince any other neutral PCs to oppose Neverember.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<p>Oghma is the Forgotten Realms god of knowledge and thought, occupying the
roughly the same position as Ioun does in the default 4e setting. This
particular PC is one of his worshipers, and for a while now they’ve been
receiving dreams and visions from the god. These start as nightmares, but soon
the threats are burned away by divine fire and the dreamer finds themselves in a
grand hall where the sound of a water clock can be heard.</p>

<p>The meaning of these visions is clear: the faithful must go to Neverwinter and
restore the House of Knowledge, a big temple to Oghma that was destroyed in the
eruption. Neverwinter used to produce famously accurate water clocks, you
see. This, and many of the city’s other lost craft secrets, could be restored
from the temple’s archive, if it still survives. This would help the city’s
reconstruction immensely, and of course bring the worship of Oghma back to the
region in a big way.</p>

<p>This is about as lofty a goal as that of the Noble, though it’s much less
concerned with secular politics. The Faithful is still going to need allies, and
so has a ready-made reason to work together with any other PCs interested in
restoring the city.</p>

<p>Oghma’s Faithful can belong to any race or class. Though the book says the theme
fits divine characters better, the actual powers printed here surprisingly good
for skill-monkeys from all power sources. Essentials Clerics can also pick up an
Oghma domain, shown later. The theme’s background skills are History, Religion,
and Streetwise.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>At level 1, the Faithful gains the <strong>Understand Language</strong> power, an encounter
power that lets the PC choose a language they’ve heard or seen in the last 24
hours and become able to understand it until the end of the encounter. Outside
of combat, that would be about 5 minutes, but as this is an encounter power you
might as well consider the PC constantly able to understand that language during
extended exploration sequences.</p>

<p>At level 5 the PC gains another power, <strong>Sudden Insight</strong>, which once per
encounter lets them re-roll a skill check and take the second result. This is
any skill, not just knowledge ones.</p>

<p>At level 10, they gain a +4 bonus to Perception checks made “to search”, which I
guess means to actively search for something (such as traps, treasure, or the
right book in the temple’s archive).</p>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>As always, these become additional options when it’s time for the PC to choose
utility powers.</p>

<p><strong>Learned Response</strong> is a level 2 daily power that lets the PC use the result of
an Insight check as their initiative for that combat. Even to me this feels a
little too narrow in scope, but it does mean the low-Dex cleric will act much
earlier once per day.</p>

<p><strong>Bad Idea</strong> is a Level 6 encounter power which can be used as an interrupt when
an adjacent creature attacks the PC. The PC slides the attacker 2 squares to
another adjacent space, and inflicts a -2 penalty to its attacks and saves for a
turn. Good for melee skirmisher-types like rogues or avengers. Clerics probably
have something better to choose here from their class.</p>

<p><strong>Tactical Inspiration</strong> is a level 10 encounter power that lets the PC shift 3
squares to be adjacent to an enemy as a move action, and also allow an ally
within 5 squares to shift 3 squares for free. I could see a warlord or rogue
taking this too, to help gain combat advantage earlier.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>This feels less spectacular to me than the Neverwinter Noble theme, as I’m not
very enthusiastic about the FR pantheon. Mechanics-wise, it’s mostly about
improving your skill checks, which can be awesome in the sort of campaign
suggested by this book where you can have plenty of non-combat investigative and
intrigue scenarios. It’s probably not going to do much for your combat
effectiveness, though.</p>

<p>Multiple PCs with this background are very easy to accommodate in the same
party, as they would all share a common cause and would have every reason to
work together.</p>

<p>Now that Neverwinter is on the way to being restored, Lord Dagult Neverember of
Waterdeep has arrived to take control. He claims to be a distant relation of the
old rulers of Neverwinter, and has declared himself Lord Protector of the city
until “order is fully restored”. He’s backed by an army of mercenaries, and
everyone expects him to crown himself king once he stamps out resistance to his
rule and controls the whole city.</p>

<p>A lot of people suspect his claim to the throne is a lie. You are completely
sure it’s bunk, because <em>you</em> are the true heir to the throne of
Neverwinter.</p>

<p>You are the child of a noblewoman who escaped the city as it was being
destroyed, shortly before you were born. She would succumb to her wounds and her
grief shortly after having you, and you would be adopted by the Thann noble
house in Waterdeep. You were given a proper noble education and consumed a
steady diet of heroic poems and epics. They told you about your true heritage
shortly after Dagult took over Neverwinter, and by the time the campaign starts
you have decided to seek your birthright there.</p>

<p>This is a lofty goal, and a difficult one: you need strong allies, and the sort
of conclusive evidence for your claim that can only be found in the ruins of the
city. It’s up to you whether the other PCs know of your heritage or not.</p>

<p>Neverwinter Nobles must be at least <em>part</em> human, because the historical lords
of the city were human. The powers suit melee defenders and give them a leaderly
bent, but there are no hard class prerequisites. The background skills are
Diplomacy and History.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The level 1 feature is an extra encounter power named <strong>Take Heart, Friend!</strong>,
which lets you use your lordly charisma to rally a comrade. It’s a minor-action
encounter power that gives an ally within 5 squares a +2 power bonus to all
defenses and 5/tier temporary HP. The “5/tier” bit means it would remain useful
even after the projected level range for this campaign, which is a nice touch.</p>

<p>The level 5 and 10 features are less flashy, which follows the usual design
formula for themes.</p>

<p>At level 5, when you flank an enemy your allies gain a +1 power bonus to attack
that enemy. This does stack with the usual +2 bonus from combat advantage.</p>

<p>At level 10, you are probably close to claiming the throne and your regal mien
is obvious for any to see. You gain a +4 bonus to Diplomacy when interacting
with citizens of Neverwinter, and a +4 bonus to Intimidate against anyone who
opposes your rule.</p>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>These are not mandatory, as I’ve said earlier. Rather, they become additional
choices alongside class powers whenever the PC would gain an utility power.</p>

<p><strong>Honorable Challenge</strong> is a Level 2 encounter power that requires a minor
action. It gives you an aura 2 that lasts a turn. Enemies inside take a -2
penalty to attack anyone other than you. In other words, it’s a wider Defender’s
Aura that lasts for a single round.</p>

<p><strong>Cover Your Ally</strong> is a level 6 encounter power. When an ally within 3 squares
of you is attacked, and you are not a target of the attack, you can swap places
with your ally as an interrupt, and become the new target of the
attack. Castling!</p>

<p><strong>Pillar of Lordly Might</strong> is a level 10 daily power. It’s a move action that
gives you a +2 to all defenses and a +5 to Diplomacy, but also immobilizes
you. This lasts for a turn but can be sustained with minor actions. Great for
all those Thou Shall Not Pass moments, and it might even allow you to negotiate
peace in the middle of a fight.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I honestly don’t have a lot of skill at gauging the effectiveness of PC powers
in 4e. These seem cool to me. They do work much better for melee defenders, and
here they work equally well for Essentials and PHB classes. I like it that none
of the powers involves attack rolls.</p>

<p>Regardless of the theme’s mechanical effectiveness, it gains major points for me
because you get to become the ruler of Neverwinter if you follow the built-in
story and succeed at it! Very few of the GMs I’ve known would just let a PC be
the True Heir to the Throne if they asked it. Here, it’s just a character option
anyone can take.</p>

<p>Technically, multiple characters in the party could take this theme. Perhaps the
mother had twins, or perhaps you had multiple nobles who fled to Waterdeep with
small or unborn children. This being 4e, I would <em>not</em> recommend using this as
an excuse for deadly intra-party conflict. After all, Dagult Neverember is
already there to provide proper opposition to the PCs. Rather, players of
multiple nobles should probably agree on who has the actual claim to the throne
and who “merely” stands to inherit an estate and become a trusted advisor to the
monarch.</p>

            <p>Chapter 2 - Character Options is the one players will be most interested in, and
the reason the book strongly recommends creating new characters to play a
Neverwinter campaign. It’s divided into four major sections: Character Themes,
Racial Backgrounds, New Domains, and the Bladesinger class.</p>

<p>In this post, we’ll introduce the concept of character themes.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-theme">What is a Theme?</h2>

<p>Character Themes are described here as the “third pillar” that defines your
character alongside race and class. I also describe them as the “thing” you have
in your Heroic Tier, just like Paragon Paths are the “thing” in Paragon and Epic
Destinies are the “thing” in Epic. They were first introduced in Dark Sun, and I
think we also got a few generic ones in Dragon before this point.</p>

<p>Here, themes are meant to give each character special knowledge and social ties
that firmly ground them in the Neverwinter campaign. Unlike a character class, a
theme is a thing that always exists and is acknowledged in the setting. People
will never really call you “a fighter”, but they will definitely notice if you
happen to be the lost heir to the throne of Neverwinter!</p>

<p>Aside from these narrative hooks, a theme also has several mechanical
widgets. At levels 1, 5 and 10, you gain a <strong>Feature</strong> specified by your theme,
which gets added on top of everything you already gain from your class. It gives
you access to a few optional <strong>utility powers</strong> which you can take instead of a
class power at levels 2, 6 and 10. And it also works like the <strong>backgrounds</strong>
from the Dungeon Master’s Guide 2: each theme lists a handful of skills, and you
pick one. If it’s already a class skill you get a +2 bonus to it. If it’s not
you can make it into a class skill, and become able to choose it during
character creation.</p>

<p>These features and powers can act to reinforce a character’s mechanical roles,
or to broaden it in ways that weren’t possible before. The narrative bits can
provide excellent reasons for the party to work together beyond the usual “you
all meet in a tavern”. They’re not exclusive either. Several PCs can pick the
same theme, and you could theoretically have a party where everyone does
that. Some of the themes are better for this than others.</p>

<p>Technically, themes are entirely optional. A heroic-tier character without a
theme would be just as viable. In practice, I’ve never seen anyone refuse to
choose a theme once they became widely available. A hypothethical edition that
refined the concepts of 4e would probably include them right in the PHB.</p>

<p>The next few posts will be dedicated to looking at the Neverwinter Campaign
Setting themes in detail, and we’ll start with the most spectacular one.</p>
