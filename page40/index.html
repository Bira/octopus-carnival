        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As I write this, I have just finished a <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">Let’s Read of the first D&amp;D 4 Monster
Manual and Monster Vault in parallel</a>, which took me about one year and four
months to complete and and around 2 years and 2 months to finish posting
here. This means it’s time to start up on the Monster Manual 2!</p>

<p>Published in 2009, this book includes both more varieties of monsters that
appeared in its predecessor, and those that are new either to the game or to
this edition of it. There’s not much in the way of preamble in its text: after
explaining the same thing I just did in the previous sentence, it launches into
a description of the stat block format and then goes right to the monster list.</p>

<p>Before I do the same, I’m going to use this post to describe some useful
information for people unfamiliar with either D&amp;D Fourth Edition, or the
conventions I’ve adopted over time while going through the first Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="fourth-edition-encounter-basics">Fourth Edition Encounter Basics</h2>

<p>While you don’t need to be intimately familiar with Fourth Edition D&amp;D to
understand my writeups, it helps to know some basic terminology.</p>

<p>4e uses the same level scale for monsters as it does for PCs. Monsters of the
same level are all worth the same amount of XP, and you calculate an encounter’s
level by adding up their XP values and adjusting it a bit for the size of your
PC party. The game’s platonic ideal of a “balanced encounter” is one where the
party faces a group of monsters of the same size and level as themselves. Note
that “balanced” here means a fairly easy fight of the sort the PCs can go
through several times per day. To make it harder increase either the number or
level of monsters, and vice-versa. A “level+1” or “level+2” encounter is
challenging, a “level+3” or “level+4” one are boss battle material. A difference
of +5 or greater is one of those situations where the PCs might be better off
running away.</p>

<p>Levels go from 1 to 30, though some rare monsters meant to be “final bosses” for
epic campaigns go a bit beyond that. It’s perfectly possible to have an entire
campaign where the party never fights a “balanced”, same-level battle.</p>

<p>Some monsters are “Elite”, which means they are more powerful and are worth two
regular creatures in the encounter building formula. Others are “Solos” and are
worth four regulars - but despite the name might not make for a fun encounter
all by themselves. Combat is a team sport! Last and least, a few are “minions”
which do less damage and go down in one hit. Four of these are worth a single
regular.</p>

<p>What this means is that you should never evaluate a monster in isolation. Always
assume it’s going to fight alongside a team of other opponents with
complimentary roles and abilities. This is true even for a lot of solo monsters.</p>

<h2 id="monster-roles">Monster Roles</h2>

<p>A monster’s role describes both the sort of tactic you should employ when using
it, and acts as a “class” of sorts. A monster’s attack bonuses, defenses, and HP
all depend on its level and role, not on what type of creature it is like in
3.x.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Skirmishers</em> have baseline stats across the board and abilities that make
them highly mobile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Brutes</em> hit hard in melee and take a lot of killin’. They have high HP, high
damage, and reduced AC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Soldiers</em> are also melee combatants, but have high AC and tend to have
abilities similar to that of a PC fighter, being good at preventing the enemy
from targetting their more fragile buddies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Lurkers</em> have attacks that do a lot of damage but require some setup. A
typical lurker will have some sort of “routine” where it makes a big attack
one turn and spends the following turn setting it up again. This makes them
good for ambush scenarios.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Controllers</em> have stats similar to those of a skirmisher, but their abilities
are a mix of ranged and melee attacks that also inflict negative conditions on
the PCs or shape the battlefield in other ways.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Artillery</em> monsters are fragile and have lousy melee attacks, but their
ranged attacks are stronger and more accurate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When designing an encounter, you’re usually supposed to mix and match the roles
so that they complement each other. <em>In general</em> you want a “front line” made up
of soldiers and brutes, with artillery and controllers hanging back and
providing ranged support, and with lurkers and skirmishers running around the
edges trying to get past the PC’s own front line. The exact composition of your
Team Monster will of course alter this in all sorts of interesting ways.</p>

<p>The existence of monster roles means we’ll often encounter monsters with several
different stat blocks, which allow you to do something like an “all-bullywug
fight” that’s still tactically interesting.</p>

<h2 id="the-dreaded-math-bugs">The Dreaded Math Bugs</h2>

<p>While the foundation of the encounter design system in 4e was really solid, it
took a bit of time for the writers to fine-tune the math. Monsters from the
first Monster Manual generally did too little damage. Elites and Solos also had
defenses that were too high, and high-level solos in particular had ridiculously
large HP totals. All of this could lead to fights that were both too easy and
too long to be fun.</p>

<p>In the Monster Manual 2, some of these problems were fixed: Elites and Solos
lost their defense bonuses, and Solos have about 20% less HP than they would
have under MM1 rules. Brutes and soldiers also had their accuracy fine-tuned
(the former missed too much, the latter were too accurate).</p>

<p>From this point on you also start seeing minions with roles: where a MM1 monster
might have been described as a “Level 10 Minion”, here you might get a “Level 10
Minion Brute” for example. Role affects a minion’s defenses and damage, but not
their HP, which is always 1 with a “minions can’t be damaged by missed attacks”
condition.</p>

<p>One problem still remains: damage is still too low, by an amount that increases
with monster level. So a level 1 or 2 monster doesn’t suffer from this at all,
but a level 25 epic threat will hit like a feather pillow when it should be
hitting like a speeding truck.</p>

<p>If you’re preparing a 4e adventure and you need to fix a MM2 stat block
yourself, the famous <a href="http://blogofholding.com/?p=512">Monster Manual 3 on a Business Card</a> post from Blog of
Holding has a wonderful summary of the definitive formulas, which you get in a
longer form in one of the DMG update PDFs that WotC published back in the day.</p>

<p>An even quicker fix is to add half the monster’s level to all of its damage
rolls, as outlined in this <a href="http://blogofholding.com/?p=782">other Blog of Holding</a> post. So, for example, add
+5 to all damage rolls for a level 10 monster. This should get you close enough
to the “correct” figures.</p>

<p>In our <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/03/06/spaceplane.html">previous post</a>, we used GURPS Spaceships rules to build a “minimum
viable spaceplane” at TL8, with no superscience.</p>

<p>Our company, Octopus Aerospace, builds one of those and sells it to the
Kerbal Space Program for close to a billion GURPS dollars<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and after using
it for a few launches Director Kerbman comes back to us with a few change
requests.</p>

<p>His astronauts have complained that the Mark I Spaceplane handles very poorly
for its size. They’re entering a phase of their program where future missions
will require a lot of precise orbital maneuvers, like docking and such, so they
need a ship that can do better at that.</p>

<p>We want to satisfy KSP’s requests because we want a slice of their inifinte
budget, but we’re also committed to making only Single Stage To Orbit craft. How
can we satisfy both of these requirements?</p>

<h2 id="building-the-mark-ii">Building the Mark II</h2>

<p>We’re still using “realistic” TL 8 for our Mark II, and it’s still streamlined
and winged just like its predecessor.</p>

<p>As we saw in our previous post, a TL8 craft capable of reaching orbit can only
spare 10% of its mass to systems that are not fuel tanks or chemical engines. We
achieved that in the Mark I by shrinking our control systems and cargo bay,
filling the freed space with additional fuel tanks.</p>

<p>We want a full size control system for the second iteration, but having that
means we’ll be short on delta-V and can’t make an orbital insertion. We have to
shrink something else to compensate. We’re already shrunk the cargo bay, and I
don’t want to shrink the armor because I’m envisioning as the craft’s heat
shield.</p>

<p>How about the engine?</p>

<p>Our resulting configuration is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 x Metallic Laminate Armor</li>
  <li>1 x SM +8 control room</li>
  <li>1 x 15-ton cargo bay</li>
  <li>17.33 x Fuel Tanks (865 tons rocket fuel)</li>
  <li>1 x SM +7 Chemical Rocket Engine (1G Acceleration)</li>
</ul>

<p>One lone G of acceleration is useless for leaving Earth… in a traditional
rocket. We have wings! According to GURPS Spaceships p. 37, a winged craft can
take off and reach Earth orbit even if its acceleration doesn’t exceed 1G.</p>

<p>That leaves us with the following stat line for our Mark II space plane:
<strong>dST/dHP</strong> 70; <strong>Air Hnd/SR</strong> +3/4; <strong>Space Hnd/SR</strong> -2/4; <strong>Move</strong> 1G/6.05mps;
<strong>LWt</strong> 1000; <strong>Load</strong> 15.3; <strong>SM</strong> +8; <strong>Occ</strong> 4; <strong>dDR</strong> 0/2/0.</p>

<p>This model’s Air Handling and Stability is pretty awesome when compared to that
of most contemporary airplanes. Its space handling is still not exactly
spectacular, but it’s the best we can do for a ship of this size at TL 8, and
should help with those delicate maneuvers. It takes longer to reach orbit due to
its lower acceleration, but it still has the same Delta-V. Finally, it has space
for one additional crew member, allowing KSP to bring extra scientists or other
mission specialists along with the payload.</p>

<p>The cheaper engine and more expensive control room balance themselves out. The
Mark II costs the same as the Mark I: a nominal $8.8M for the craft and $693,200
for a full load of rocket fuel.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-notessales-pitch">Bonus Notes/Sales Pitch</h2>

<p>This is something I forgot to mention in the previous post: both the Mark I and
Mark II Octopus Carnival Spaceplanes can take off from conventional runways,
dispensing with the need for an expensive launch pad!</p>

<p>The Mark I would probably require a launchpad if you want to use those 3Gs of
acceleration right away, but if I remember correctly liquid fuel engines can be
throttled. So you can take off using a jet-engine-equivalent 1G and throttle up
when you reach a higher altitude.</p>

<p>Even when you multiply their nominal cost by 100 for the extremely limited
production run, you still end up with a cost-effective system. SpaceX’s
semi-reusable rockets cost between $50M and $150M <em>per launch</em>. The real-world
Space Shuttle cost between $500M and $1.5B per launch. The Saturn V cost about
$1.6B per launch in modern dollars.</p>

<p>Our fictional spaceplane would cost little more than the cost of a load of
fuel. Sure, it’d need to undergo maintenance between flights, but it probably
wouldn’t need to be practically rebuilt like the real-world systems. So perhaps
we’re looking at $2M per launch or so? It practically pays for itself in six
launches or so when compared to the “competition”.</p>

<p>Of course, that’s a very optimistic assumption. In your games you’re always free
to assume Octopus Aerospace is full of shit and this thing is a lemon in all its
incarnations. It’s what prevented all those real world spaceplane projects from
going forward, after all.</p>

<p>I’ve been reading about Kerbal Space Program recently, and it made me want to
try my hand at designing some GURPS spaceships.</p>

<p>One of the terms that often gets thrown about when talking about near-future
space tech is “Single Stage to Orbit”, or SSTO. This would be a vehicle that can
go from ground to orbit all by itself, without needing any detachable
boosters. In the real world, a lot of plans for building one of these have been
conceived and dropped, but we don’t have a real example yet.</p>

<p>How close does GURPS Spaceships think we are to such a thing?</p>

<p>In this post I’ll try to design a spaceplane, a popular type of theoretical SSTO
craft. The basic idea is that they take off and fly to the upper atmosphere
using air-breathing engines, and only then activate their rockets to reach
orbit. After completing their mission, they can re-enter atmosphere and land by
gliding. Spaceplanes are an attractive concept because they can use a lot less
fuel to reach orbit, are fully reusable, and easier to maintain. Plus they tend
to look really cool.</p>

<h2 id="mission-statement-and-design-options">Mission Statement and Design Options</h2>

<p>For this attempt, we’re going to assume a realistic TL8 setting (“present-day
technology”), giving us access to TL7 and 8 items from the book. I’ll
arbitrarily assign it SM +8, making it a 1000 ton craft.</p>

<p>Therefore, our craft is SM +8, TL8, streamlined, and winged. It must take off
from the ground on Earth and reach orbital velocity using without the aid of
external boosters or detachable stages, while carrying a multi-ton payload in
its cargo hold.</p>

<p>This means it must have a total delta-V exceeding 5.6 miles per second after all
the calculations are done<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. We get a bonus 0.3 mps if we launch eastwards
from the equator, but having the craft reach the number on its own would allow
it to launch from anywhere in the planet.</p>

<h3 id="fixed-systems">Fixed Systems</h3>

<p>The design options above lock down 3 of the 20 systems we have available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We need 1 armor system because we’re streamlined.</li>
  <li>We need a control room (1 system).</li>
  <li>We need a cargo bay (1 system).</li>
</ul>

<p>For our purposes in this post it doesn’t matter what the armor is made of, but
we might as well use Metallic Laminate since we’re designing a “cutting edge”
craft. The remaining 17 systems will be split among engines and fuel tanks.</p>

<p>At our TL, we have two engine options: the Chemical Rocket and the Jet
Engine. They both help, but use different fuel sources. Adding jet engines means
we need to figure out their top airspeed and subtract that from the necessary
delta-V to reach orbit. Rocket delta-V is purely a function of how many tanks we
dedicate to rocket fuel.</p>

<h3 id="attempt-1-mixing-rockets-and-jet-engines">Attempt 1: Mixing Rockets and Jet Engines.</h3>

<p>My first draft had the following configuration for our 17 “free” systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 Jet Engines</li>
  <li>1 Chemical Rocket Engine</li>
  <li>14 Fuel Tanks (13 for rocket fuel, 1 for jet fuel).</li>
</ul>

<p>The jet fuel allowed us to run the jets for half an hour, which was more than
enough to reach maximum speed and altitude. They lowered our target to 4.63 mps,
but that’s not enough. Combining the rules for chemical rockets and fuel tanks,
our rocket had 3.12 mps of delta-V available to it.</p>

<p>This might be good for a fancy passenger plane for people with money to burn,
but not for a SSTO vehicle.</p>

<h3 id="attempt-2-rocket-plane">Attempt 2: Rocket Plane</h3>

<p>What if we build an all-rocket engine assembly?</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 Chemical Rocket Engine</li>
  <li>16 fuel tanks (all rocket fuel)</li>
</ul>

<p>Adding up the delta-V for this version is easier, and we do end up with more of
it, but it’s still not enough. We get 4.8 out of 5.6 mps. So close, yet so far.</p>

<p>What this configuration gives us is a reusable <em>launch-assist vehicle</em> can get
its 50-ton payload <em>almost</em> to orbital speeds. The payload itself would need to
be another vehicle that could provide the remaining 0.8 mps of delta-V itself,
and perhaps include a bit more for maneuvers once in orbit. The LAV can spend
all of its own fuel and glide down.</p>

<h3 id="attempt-3-cheating-with-optional-rules">Attempt 3: Cheating with Optional Rules.</h3>

<p>We’ve run up against one of the harsh realities of the Spaceships design
rules. Using only TL7-8 chemical rockets, you simply can’t make an orbit-capable
vehicle with less than 17 fuel tanks. A traditional disposable rocket can be
modeled with 1 chemical rocket system, 17 fuel tanks, and an upper stage with an
SM 2 smaller than the rocket itself. This upper stage has the armor needed by a
streamlined craft, and the discarded lower stage burns up on re-entry. Our
spaceplane faces some trouble because it needs to include that armor system
itself, leaving us 1 fuel tank short.</p>

<p>The only way we can make it work is by pulling in an optional rule from GURPS
Spaceships 7 p. 4: Smaller Systems. By shrinking both our cargo bay and control
room to SM +7, we decrease our cargo capacity to 15 tons, decrease our
Handling/SR in by 1, and add 1.33 fuel tanks to our all-rocket spaceplane. That
gets us 6.05 mps of delta-V, enough to launch from anywhere on the planet and
still leave us some reserves for maneuvers and corrections. It carries less than
the equivalent disposable rocket but is fully reusable, able to land by gliding
even with an empty fuel tank.</p>

<p>We leave the armor system at the same size because it’s meant to serve as a heat
shield on re-entry, so it’s probably placed in the central hull.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The thing we just designed is remarkably similar to the Lockheed-Martin
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VentureStar">VentureStar</a>, at least if the stats in the Wikipedia article are to be
believed. This is a project for a SSTO spaceplane whose most famous product is
the X-33 prototype, a scaled-down version of the final design intended to test
some of its technologies.</p>

<p>VentureStar was supposed to be a lot simpler to maintain than the space shuttle,
and was intended to be available for sale to private companies and not just to
NASA, kick-starting a wave of private space exploration. The project was
cancelled in 2001 because its fuel tanks were too hard to manufacture using the
technology of the time. Ironically, better manufacturing techniques were
discovered a few years later.</p>

<p>Aside from having to contend with the “harsh truth” of the design rules we
already mentioned, our spaceplane also illustrates what seems to be a constraint
plaguing real-world designers: separate air-breathing and rocket engines are
inefficient. Go rocket-only or get you an engine that can do both.</p>

<p>Its final stats are: dST/dHP 70; Air Hnd/SR +2/3; Space Hnd/SR -3/3; Move
3G/6.05mps; LWt. 1000; Load 15.3; SM+8; Occ 3; dDR 0/2/0. The Space handling is
terrible, but workable when the mission is “get up, release the payload, get
down”.</p>

<p>Our spaceplane costs $8.8M according to the design rules. Of course, that’s its
price if it was mass-produced and commercially available. The rather more
bespoke space program manufacturing model means it could cost up to 100 times
more. It runs on liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen rocket fuel, a full load of which
costs $693,200.</p>

<p>The LAV version has better handling and stability (+3/4 in air and -2/4 in
space) and costs about $40K less to fuel, and can deliver a bigger payload as
long as that payload has some delta-V of its own. But it’s not a spaceplane, so
nyeh.</p>

<p>Before I close the curtain on this Let’s Read, there’s one more thing to
discuss. I had forgotten it was there at all! Back when the Monster Manual had
just been published, though, I remember thinking it was a big deal.</p>

<p>We’ve been talking about the animal appendix on the Monster Vault, but the
Monster Manual also has an appendix. This one is filled with stats for using
several of the book’s entries as playable characters!</p>

<p>Some of them are for characters from that were traditionally considered “monster
races”, others are for races that had been popular in previous editions but
didn’t fit into the Player’s Handbook. The full list is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bugbear</li>
  <li>Doppelganger</li>
  <li>Drow</li>
  <li>Githyanki</li>
  <li>Githzerai</li>
  <li>Gnoll</li>
  <li>Gnome</li>
  <li>Goblin</li>
  <li>Hobgoblin</li>
  <li>Kobold</li>
  <li>Minotaur</li>
  <li>Orc</li>
  <li>Shadar-kai</li>
  <li>Shifter (Longtooth and Razorclaw)</li>
  <li>Warforged</li>
</ul>

<p>Each one has more or less the same information as a basic racial stat block from
the PHB: Average height and weight, ability score bonuses, size speed, vision
modes, starting languages, skill bonuses and a racial power.</p>

<p>The reason I forgot this appendix even existed is because it slowly became less
relevant as more 4e material was published.</p>

<p>Even at the start the appendix races were already a little bit behind
mechanically, since the ones from the PHB had a handful of extra racial feats
each and these didn’t. The gap widened as further player option books came out
with yet more feats and stuff like racial paragon paths. And finally, several of
the appendix races would have more complete versions published in future books,
rendering the appendix version obsolete.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Doppelgangers, Shifters and Warforged would appear in the Eberron Player’s
Guide.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gnomes would appear in the PHB2. Half-Orcs too, which you could just reskin
into full orcs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Githzerai and Minotaurs would appear in the PHB 3.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drow would appear in the Forgotten Realms Player’s Guide and then in Heroes of
the Forgotten Kingdoms.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That’s almost all of them, isn’t it? Gnolls and Shadar-kai would get articles in
Dragon or Dungeon, but they still ended up with less support overall. At some
point in the edition the ability score bonuses also went from “+2 to these two
fixed scores” to “+2 to one fixed score and +2 to one of these other two
scores”, and some of the races here never did get that third option. Still, this
appendix was pretty useful before all of this extra material came out.</p>

<p>And this slightly maudlin post finally finishes our Let’s Read of the first
Monster Manual! I hope you enjoyed it. I plan on doing the other two and the
other Vault, and hopefully I’ll take less time to post those in their entirety.</p>

<p>This is it. The final entry in the Monster Manual, the only Z monster, and the
penultimate post in this particular Let’s Read. Zombies have of course been in
the game since the very beginning. Here they are present both in the Monster
Manual and the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>You know what they’re like: rotting corpses who slowly shamble around and attack
the living. They’re one of those monsters who made it into D&amp;D from popular
culture and are extremely popular outside of the game (like vampires, or
dragons). There’s a whole lot of different zombie versions out there, and it
seems the game has made an effort to incorporate most of them.</p>

<p>Like skeletons, zombies are often created through a necromantic ritual that
creates an animus and nails it to a dead body. They might also be spontaneously
created when an area is bathed in necrotic emanations, or when some sort of
divine curse falls over it, which is more common with zombies than with
skeletons.</p>

<p>The main difference, of course, is that zombies are still fleshy. That flesh
<em>remembers</em>, however poorly, what it’s like to be alive. A zombie’s dead heart
still pumps its rotten blood. Its lungs still wheeze, and its guts still
hunger. Left to their own devices, zombies will seek the warmth of the living
and try to eat their flesh, moving on to new victims when the current one gets
cold. Zombies who have a master will follow that master’s orders, but they’re
not smart enough to do anything complex.</p>

<p>Though the typical image of a zombie is that of an animated human corpse, that’s
not necessarily true! Anything that had a pulse in life can be animated as a
zombie, by ritual or accident.</p>

<p>D&amp;D zombies are not “contagious”, but you can still have a zombie apocalypse
when a sudden influx of necrotic energy into a region causes every corpse within
to rise as a zombie. And if the infusion is constant, then people killed by
these zombies would rise as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Zombies are Natural Animates with the Undead keyword. Their size is the same as
the original creature, usually Medium or Large. Monster Manual zombies have
necrotic resistance and radiant vulnerability like all other undead, but the
Vault ones aren’t so fancy and have neither. Most are fairly slow, with a Speed
of 4, but there are exceptions. They all have Darkvision.</p>

<p>The two signature traits for Monster Vault zombies are <strong>Zombie Weakness</strong> and
<strong>Deathless Hunger</strong>. The first one causes any critical hit to reduce the zombie
to 0 HP instantly (“Boom! Headshot!”). The other triggers when they’re reduced
to 0 HP: roll a d20, and if the result is 15 or more, the zombie remains at 1 HP
instead. This means they’re both unusually fragile and unusually tough. Several
MM zombies have similar traits, but they’re less universal.</p>

<h3 id="grasping-zombie-monster-vault">Grasping Zombie (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>This Medium Level 1 Brute has 33 HP and all the standard traits. It attacks with
<strong>Slams</strong> that do extra damage against grabbed targets and can instead try to
grab someone with <strong>Zombie Grasp</strong> (melee 1 vs. Reflex) which does no damage but
grabs the creature (escape DC 12).</p>

<p>They naturally lend themselves to classic zombie horde tactics, surrounding
victims, grabbing and beating them up/biting them into chunks.</p>

<h3 id="zombie-monster-manual">Zombie (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>This is basically a Level 2 version of the Grasping Zombie, with 40 HP. Its
defenses are actually a bit lower, but the escape DC for the grab is higher
because victims have a -5 penalty to escape it.</p>

<h3 id="zombie-rotter-monster-manual">Zombie Rotter (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>A level 3 minion brute with a single <strong>slam</strong> attack, Speed 4, and none of the
special traits listed above. Pretty simple. Make sure to use literal hordes of
them.</p>

<p>The monster Vault instead has Zombie Shamblers, which are level 5 minions and
have Deathless Hunger, making them tougher than usual.</p>

<h3 id="gravehound-monster-manual">Gravehound (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>A zombie dog! It’s Medium and unlike its humanoid counterparts it can run at
Speed 8. Its <strong>bite</strong> also deals ongoing necrotic damage (save ends), and knocks
Medium or smaller targets prone. It has Zombie Weakness, and when it hits 0 HP
it makes one last bite attack as a free action.</p>

<h3 id="corruption-corpse-monster-manual">Corruption Corpse (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>A <em>regenerating</em> Medium zombie who uses this fact to rip out chunks of itself
and throw them at victims. It’s Level 4 Artillery with 46 HP. Its <strong>Grave
Stench</strong> acts as an aura (1) that inflicts a -5 penalty to all attacks,
discouraging enemies from getting into melee range. Its regeneration turns off
for a turn if the zombie takes radiant damage.</p>

<p>Though the corpse’s <strong>slams</strong> are weak, its thrown <strong>motes of corruption</strong>
(ranged 10 vs. reflex) do decent necrotic damage and weaken (save ends). When
killed, it explodes in a close burst 1 vs. Fortitude, dealing necrotic damage to
all in the area.</p>

<h3 id="hulking-zombie-monster-vault">Hulking Zombie (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>This Large Level 4 Brute with 70 HP was clearly an ogre in life. Its <strong>slams</strong>
are Reach 2 and do extra damage to prone or grabbed targets. Its <strong>Zombie Rush</strong>
allows it to charge (with its speed of 4) and make an attack against Fortitude
that does the same damage as a slam and knocks prone.</p>

<h3 id="zombie-hulk-monster-manual">Zombie Hulk (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>Pretty much the same monster, only this one is Level 8 with 88 HP because MM
ogres are level 8. In place of Zombie Rush it has <strong>Zombie Smash</strong>, a recharge 6
melee attack that does a lot of damage and knocks prone. Zombie Hulk Smash, get
it?</p>

<p>Instead of Deathless Hunger it has the much more dangerous <strong>Rise Again</strong>, which
triggers automatically when the zombie hits 0 HP and makes it get back up with
44 HP at the start of its next turn.</p>

<h3 id="rotwing-zombie-monster-manual">Rotwing Zombie (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>A <em>flying</em> zombie, either because it was a flying creature in life or because
some maniac stitched wings to it. It’s still speed 4 both in the ground and in
the air, so don’t expect fancy maneuvers here.</p>

<p>Still, it does have a little trick: its <strong>slams</strong> do extra damage when used as
part of a flying charge.</p>

<h3 id="flesh-crazed-zombie-monster-vault">Flesh-Crazed Zombie (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>AKA a “Romero Zombie”, which kinda steps in the ghoul’s toes. This one is a
Level 4 Skirmisher with 55 HP and all standard zombie traits. Its speed is 6, or
8 when charging. <strong>Flesh-Crazed Charge</strong> ensures its charges don’t provoke
opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>These zombies fight with <strong>clubs</strong>, which do extra damage on a charge. If they
can’t charge, they’ll <strong>bite</strong>, which actually does more damage and dazes for a
turn.</p>

<h3 id="chillborn-zombie-monster-manual">Chillborn Zombie (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>The corpse of someone who died in the cold. It’s a Level 6 Soldier with 71 HP,
and exudes a <strong>Chillborn Aura</strong> (2) which does 5 cold damage per turn to those
caught inside. Multiple chillborn auras <em>stack</em>. This zombie also has Resist
Cold 10.</p>

<p>Hey, given enough of these they might end up damaging each other with their
auras! I don’t think this was the intention, so you can just say they’re immune
to each other’s auras.</p>

<p>Their <strong>slams</strong> immobilize for a turn and inflict ongoing cold damage (save
ends). When they die, <strong>Death Burst</strong> causes them to explode and deal cold
damage in a Close Burst 1 (vs. Fortitude). <strong>Ice Reaper</strong> makes either of these
attacks deal extra cold damage to immobilized targets.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I consider zombies to be an important part of the dungeon fantasy genre, which
includes D&amp;D. They’re not an exclusive monster or anything, but they’re
inevitably one of the first undead any party is going to face. The variety shown
here is interesting: though the MV stat blocks are a little better mechanically,
they’re also a lot more conventional in appearance and concept. “Normal zombie”,
“big zombie”, “fast zombie”. You should absolutely make an effort to spring the
more exotic varieties on your players if possible.</p>

<p>What about possible encounters? Any two-bit necromancer can animate a zombie or
ten, so they’re a good fit for any encounter or adventure that might include one
of those. Surprisingly they also work well with other non-sapient creatures, as
long as neither would eat the other and the living critters aren’t bothered by
the smell. The sample MM encounters bear this out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 3 standard zombies, 4 rotters, 4 kruthik hatchlings, and 2 wererats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 2 hulks, 2 rot scarab swarms, 1 oni night haunter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Both encounters clearly include monsters who could be considered necromancers,
but I suppose the kruthiks and the scarabs could be found alongside zombies even
without a sapient to handle them. And of course, other undead work fine as
zombie buddies.</p>
