    <p>The table of standard monsters that make up the AbSov’s roster includes pretty
much every heroic-tier aberrant creature, from Fell Taints (MM2) to Mooncalves
(Threats to the Nentir Vale). It also includes Heroic-Tier versions of iconic
aberrants usually found in Paragon, and non-aberrant creatures and humanoids
that can act as covert agents or as the basis for mutated monstrosities with the
Plaguechanged Monster theme described here.</p>

<p>We’ll take a look at the new monsters, NPCs, and at the template here.</p>

<h2 id="aboleth-opener">Aboleth Opener</h2>

<p>This is an aboleth specializing in brute-force psychic intrusion, “opening the
mind” of its victims using mental attacks and then dominating them for transport
to the underground base, where they will become test subjects. It’s a Large
Aberrant Magical Beast and a Level 7 Controller with 82 HP and the Aquatic
keyword. It has darkvision, a ground speed of 5, and a swim speed of 7.</p>

<p>The Opener projects an <strong>Eroding Mucus Haze</strong>, an aura (5) that is difficult
terrain for enemies and deals 5 psychic damage to any dazed enemy that starts
their turn inside. It can fight in melee with its <strong>Flaying Tentacles</strong>, which
do immediate and ongoing damage, but it prefers to stick to mental attacks if
possible in order to avoid damaging the goods.</p>

<p>The creature’s title comes from its <strong>Mental Lance</strong> ranged attack, which deals
psychic damage and dazes for a turn. It can then target dazed targets with
<strong>Enslaved Open Mind</strong>, a minor action power that dominates the target (save
ends). This recharges whenever the Opener has no dominated victims.</p>

<h2 id="aboleth-remnant">Aboleth Remnant</h2>

<p>Not even the aboleths themselves are immune to Spellplague corruption. Exposure
tends to turn them into these Remnants, whose body constantly spawns and sheds
tentacles and other limbs, and whose mind is in tatters. Remnants can fly,
unlike typical aboleths. They’re treated like the rest of the base’s “trash”,
and sent up the chasm to harass Neverwinter.</p>

<p>These wretches are Large Aberrant Magical Beasts and Level 5 Brutes with 78 HP
and the Aquatic keyword. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 5, a flight
speed of 7 (hover) and a swim speed of 10. They project an aura (2) of
<strong>Maddening Mucus</strong>, which acts as difficult terrain for enemies and makes them
grant combat advantage while inside.</p>

<p>Their attacks are a Reach 2 <strong>Telescoping Tentacle</strong> that damages and knocks
prone on a hit, and a <strong>Tentacle Flurry</strong> that targets enemies in a Close Burst
2, damaging and dazing them on a hit (save ends). A miss here deals half
damage. This recharges when the creature is first bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="grell-strangler">Grell Strangler</h2>

<p>This less-venomous variety of Grell is fond of strangling its victims. It’s a
Medium Aberrant Magical Beast with the Blind keyword. It has Blindsight 12, a
ground speed of 1, and a flight speed of 6 (hover).</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Tentacle Lash</strong> that deals physical damage and
forces the target to grant combat advantage for a turn. That last one seems to
be a poison effect.</p>

<p>If the strangler isn’t grabbing anyone at the moment, it can use <strong>Grasping
Tentacles</strong> to remedy the situation. This Reach 2 attack does a bit of physical
damage and grabs the target (escape DC 16). The grell can immediately shift 1
square and pull the victim up to 2 squares, and while the grab persists the
victim takes 5 ongoing damage.</p>

<p>Once the strangler grabs someone, it will use <strong>Haul Away</strong> to do exactly
that. This move action lets it shift half its speed and drag a victim along with
it.</p>

<p>These are great for separating the party and messing up their
formations. Defenders and controllers should focus on locking them down to
prevent that.</p>

<h2 id="nothic-plagegazer">Nothic Plagegazer</h2>

<p>This monster is entirely made by the chaotic magic of the Spellplague
pocket. Its gaze can inflict a debilitating spell sickness on its victims.</p>

<p>Plaguegazers are Medium Aberrant Humanoids and Level 6 Artillery with 60
HP. They have a speed of 6, darkvision, and truesight 10. They exude an <strong>Oozing
Plague</strong> from their skin that causes any creature that ends their turn adjacent
to the nothic to take ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>The nothic prefers to keep away from enemies and attack them with its
<strong>Sickening Gaze</strong>, which deals necrotic damage, ongoing 5 poison damage, and
slows (save ends both). After the first failed save, the Slowed condition
worsens to Immobilized.</p>

<p>It can also use an area attack named <strong>Spread the Infection</strong>. This targets a
creature taking ongoing poison damage, and affects an Area Burst 1 centered on
them. It deals necrotic damage and inflicts ongoing 10 poison damage (save ends)
on those it hits. On a miss, it still inflicts half its immediate and ongoing
damage. It recharges when the nothic is bloodied.</p>

<p>If it has no other choices, it will use its <strong>claws</strong> in melee. They have no
riders, but Oozing Plague will probably be in effect here.</p>

<h2 id="nothic-mindwarp">Nothic Mindwarp</h2>

<p>Another nothic produced by the plague pocket. It’s more insane than usual, and
likes to caper and cackle about as it drives others mad with its gaze. It’s a
Level 3 Lurker with 42 HP and a Speed of 6.</p>

<p>The mindwarp will try to affect someone with its <strong>Warping Gaze</strong>, a ranged
attack that deals psychic damage and forces the target to grant CA (save
ends). While the target is affected by this condition, the nothic becomes
invisible to everyone but the target, and its basic <strong>claw</strong> attack does 1d6
extra damage. On a miss, the nothic still has partial concealment for a
turn. The power recharges when the victim saves against it.</p>

<p>So the tactic here is to use Warping Gaze on someone, and then try to attack
<em>someone else</em> with enhanced claw attacks, repeating the procedure when the
gaze’s victim saves against it.</p>

<p>If the nothic gets surrounded, it can use its <strong>Forbidding Glare</strong> encounter
power to attack enemies in a Close Burst 2, dealing psychic damage and pushing
them 2 squares on a hit.</p>

<h2 id="plaguechanged-monster-theme">Plaguechanged Monster Theme</h2>

<p>A monster <em>theme</em> modifies a monster in a less drastic way than a monster
<em>template</em>. Templates turn a regular into an elite or an elite into a
solo. Themes add a couple of flavorful powers without changing the monster’s
level or “quality”. They’re a great way to really tie a dungeon together, even
if the base creatures are very disparate otherwise.</p>

<p>Plaguechanged monsters are affected by the Spellplague. They show the scars or
mutations associated with it, and possess magic abilities that use its
characteristic blue flames and corruptive effects.</p>

<p>I was mistaken before - plaguechanged monsters do <em>not</em> gain the ability to
sense spellscarred PCs, nor do they suffer defense penalties against these
PCs. To create one, you just add one attack and one utility power to the base
creature from the sets provided here.</p>

<p>Attack powers include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blue Fire Burst</strong>: Encounter, triggers when first bloodied. Close burst 2
vs. Reflex, deals fire and force damage, pushes 2 squares.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inferno Step</strong>: Teleport 5 squares and attack a Close Burst 1 on
arrival. This deals fire damage and knocks prone on a hit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scouring Lash</strong>: At-will reach 2 melee attack, deals fire and force damage
and slides 1 square on a hit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Unraveling Touch</strong> Encounter reach 1 melee attack, deals necrotic damage and
dazes (save ends).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The attack and damage from all of these are expressed in terms of the base
creature’s level, so they can be applied to any monster from any book - even
minions, as the DMG2 has rules for applying themes to them.</p>

<p>Utility powers include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Burning Gaze</strong> Encounter, minor action. Invisible or otherwise hidden
enemies within 5 squares of the creature glow with blue flame, losing the
benefits from cover and concealment and granting combat advantage until the
end of the creature’s next turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Devourer of Flame</strong>: Encounter, triggers in reaction to taking fire
damage. The creature gains temporary HP equal to half the fire damage, and a
+4 bonus do damage rolls until the end of its next turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wings of Blue Fire</strong>: Encounter, move action. The creature flies its speed,
and anyone making opportunity attacks against it during this movement takes
fire damage equal to the creature’s level.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prophet-of-helms-hold">Prophet of Helm’s Hold</h2>

<p>Here we have a surprise NPC big-shot belonging to the AbSov faction. Rohini is
the person in charge of Helm’s Hold, which as we saw before has been converted
into a hospital for Spellplague victims and has a Realms-wide good reputation
for its humanitarian efforts. This is where we learn that the Hold is a front
for the Abolethic Sovereignity, and Rohini is their agent. There was already
some mention of it in the New Neverwinter section, but this one gives us the
full details.</p>

<p>The Prophet of Helm’s Hold presents herself as an attractive and charismatic
female human, but she’s something fair weirder. Not long ago, she was a succubus
summoned by the Ashmadai and tasked with infiltrating the spellscarred treatment
center in Neverwinter’s House of Knowledge. There, a priest corrupted by the
Sovereignity exposed her to an artifact named the Hex Locus, a solidified chunk
of Spellplague magic. This warped the devil and infused her with the same
essence that turns humans into foulspawn.</p>

<p>Rohini’s main mission is to safeguard the Locus, which she moved to Helm’s
Hold. Her secondary goal is to collect new Choir candidates from among the
Hold’s patients and send them to the underground base. She is called the Prophet
because she makes statements about future events that tend to come true (due to
AbSov meddling). Her healing blessings are entirely fake, and make patients feel
good just as their condition steadily worsens.</p>

<p>Rohini has stats very similar to a [standard succubus][1], making her a Level 9
Controller. There are some important differences, though. She’s Aberrant instead
of Immortal. Her basic Corrupting Touch is upgraded to a <strong>Maddening Touch</strong>
that does psychic damage and slides 2 squares. Her Charming Kiss turns into a
<strong>Soul-Wrenching Kiss</strong> that places more restrictions upon the victim.</p>

<p>As before, the victim of the kiss is unable to attack the succubus, but they
also can’t willingly move away from her, closing the main loophole in the basic
succubus’ power. They also take 10 ongoing fire and psychic damage while under
the effect of the kiss. All of this is a (save ends) package, and it also ends
when Rohini attacks the victim or uses the kiss on someone else.</p>

<p>Her Loyal Consort power is upgraded to <strong>Mind-Warped Bodyguard</strong>. Now it works
as long as the victim of the Kiss is within 5 squares of Rohini, and lets them
teleport to switch places before redirecting attacks to the victim.</p>

<h2 id="chartilifax">Chartilifax</h2>

<p>This complicated name belongs to a [young green dragon][2] who used to inhabit
the Neverwinter Wood, and which Rohini managed to seduce and
subvert. Experiments performed by the AbSov’s foulspawn sorcerers have given him
the ability to transform into a Medium humanoid like his master, and the
Devourer of Flame power from the Plaguechanged theme.</p>

<p>Chartilifax spends most of his days in the shape of a green-skinned elf in the
basements under Helm’s Hold, performing menial tasks. He’s also pretty close to
Rohini’s seat of power, so he’s gonna be there as a nasty surprise when the PCs
manage to corner her there.</p>
