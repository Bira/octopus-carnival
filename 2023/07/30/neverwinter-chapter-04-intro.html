    <p>Here begins Chapter 4, the Gazeteer. This takes up the remaining half of the
book and focuses on describing interesting places in the region and their
associated plot hooks. It also talks about interesting NPCs that might get
involved with the group. These locations and people aren’t fully mapped or
statted out, but are intended to serve as starting points for individual GMs to
customize. As promised in the book’s preface, a lot of plot hooks here are
optional and/or multiple-choice, and GMs are free to change anything in here
however they want.</p>

<p>The chapter covers several major areas, and we might need more than one post for
each of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ruined Neverwinter</strong> is the city proper, struggling to rebuild and deal with
political intrigue, dangerous ruins, and plaguechanged monsters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Helm’s Hold</strong> is a stout-hearted village with a monastic community that
hides a terrible threat to the region.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Neverwinter Wood</strong>: You wouldn’t believe how many dangerous places and
threatening factions can fit into this one forest!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Gauntlgrym</strong>: the hidden dwarven city no longer has any dwarves in it, but
it has pretty much everything else including that slumbering primordial.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Evernight</strong> is Neverwinter’s reflection on the Shadowfell and the main
battleground in the war between Thayans and Netherese.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Thay Through the Veil</strong>: PCs who follow the plot threads from Evernight all
the way to their end might find themselves needing to make some visits to Nazi
Necromancer Central.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
