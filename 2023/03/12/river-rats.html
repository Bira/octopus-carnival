<p>A very specific group that makes the city of Fallcrest its home.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Before we talk about the River Rats, I figure it’s useful to talk a bit about
Fallcrest itself. This is information from both the DMG and this book.</p>

<p>Fallcrest grew around a small fort (Moonstone Keep) originally built to guard a
portage site around a big waterfall in the Nentir River. The entire rest of the
river is perfectly navigable, but trade boats arriving at this point need to
unload their cargo so that it can be hauled up or down the limestone cliffs
around the waterfall that would eventually give the city its name. The loading
points are known as the Upper and Lower Quays.</p>

<p>Fallcrest was a prosperous trade hub for many years, but it was hit hard by the
Bloodspear invasion. It hasn’t recovered completely even after all these years,
since the volume of foreign trade coming into the Vale was severely reduced by
the fall of Nerath.</p>

<p>The cliffs split Fallcrest into two districts, Hightown and Lowtown. Hightown is
located at the more defensible top of the cliff. It suffered relatively little
during the sack of the city and was the first area to be rebuilt and resettled,
making it the wealthier half of the city in our narrative present.</p>

<p>Lowtown is the poorer half, located at the foot of the cliff. It was almost
completely razed back during the invasion, and only began to see new
construction much later, as the city began growing again. There are still
significant stretches of it that are abandoned or ruined, which make good
hideouts for the city’s criminal element.</p>

<p>That finally brings us to the River Rats, which are a significant faction in
that criminal element. This gang had a Dickensian start, with a band of orphans
who got together for protection and were turned to crime by an unscrupulous
adult. Most of its members are grownups in our narrative present, but they still
recruit new members by taking in street urchins. These new recruits are provided
with food, shelter, training, and a sense of camaraderie they have likely never
experienced before, which makes the River Rats extremely loyal to each other.
They also have something of a “us against the world” mentality, since the world
never gave them any of the things the Rats did.</p>

<p>The gang’s current leader is Kelson, the halfling who owns the Lucky Gnome
Taphouse and who despite rising from the ranks neatly fills the archetype of the
exploitative leader. The Taphouse is the cheapest and rowdiest of Fallcrest’s
taverns, catering to dockworkers and porters. Despite the unsavory reputations
of the Taphouse and its owner, Kelson has not yet been linked to the activities
of the River Rats.</p>

<p>The gang has a wide repertoire, but the most profitable of their activities
consists of burglarizing the warehouses near the Lower Quays. Kelson chooses
targets based on the information he overhears in the Taphouse, and his gang is
very enthusiastic about following through. Merchants who make use of these
warehouses must carefully weigh the risk of losing their merchandise against the
abusive monopoly prices charged by the Porter’s Guild to haul the cargo to safer
storage spaces in the Upper Quays. The Porter’s Guild is <em>not</em> in collusion with
the Rats, but the overall picture still adds up to quite a damper on Fallcrest’s
economy.</p>

<p>Kelson dreams of expanding the River Rats into a true criminal syndicate with
chapters on every city in the Vale, but before he focuses on that he wants to
eliminate all his rivals in Fallcrest. If his plans succeed, Fallcrest could be
the site of a bloody gang war, likely between the Rats and the Shadow Court plus
whatever other groups the GM wants to add into the mix.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As a hostile faction that resides in Fallcrest itself, the River Rats are early
to mid-Heroic threats. They’re from a variety of “playable” species, and as
mentioned in he Lore section are mostly Unaligned, since their loyalty to each
other is their main motivation.</p>

<p>You can easily switch their races around for more variety through the usual
tactic of changing and reassigning the relevant stats and abilities.</p>

<p>The gang’s signature trait is <strong>River Rat Tactics</strong>, which lets its owner gain
combat advantage against any enemy who has one of the owner’s allies adjacent to
them.</p>

<h3 id="lowtown-urchin">Lowtown Urchin</h3>

<p>These halflings are actually around the age of a typical starting adventurer,
but they disguise themselves as human children to avoid suspicion as they pick
pockets and spy on people.</p>

<p>Our urchin is a Level 1 Skirmisher with 28 HP. As a halfling they have a Speed
of 6 and a +5 bonus to saves vs. Fear effects. They fight with a <strong>dagger</strong>, and
will use the <strong>Cloak of Filth</strong> that covers them to make themselves harder to
hit. This is a move action that allows them to shift 3 squares and gain partial
concealment for a turn. As a halfling, they can use the <strong>Second Chance</strong> power
once per encounter to force an enemy who hit them to reroll the attack and use
the new result.</p>

<p>When bloodied, the Urchin will resort to the <strong>River Rat’s Gambit</strong> special
attack. This encounter power lets them make a basic attack and cause 2d6 bonus
damage if that attack hits. If it misses, the urchin takes 1d6 damage instead.</p>

<h3 id="market-green-grifter">Market Green Grifter</h3>

<p>Grifters usually pick pockets or run rigged gambling scams in Fallcrest’s Market
Green area, but might be called in to do other work. They’re not very good at
direct confrontations, but they can play dead like no one else. This one’s a
half-elf.</p>

<p>The grifter fights with a <strong>Short Sword</strong> whose basic attack profile is nothing
special. They’ll make a half-assed attempt at fighting until they first take
damage, and then they’ll <strong>Play Dead</strong>. This causes the grifter to fall
prone. Until the start of the grifter’s next turn, they have a +5 to all
defenses against close and area attacks, and enemies must spend a minor action
to roll and pass a DC 20 Insight check to target them with melee or ranged
attacks (otherwise, the enemy will believe the grifter is dead).</p>

<p>On their next turn, the grifter can come <strong>Back From the Dead</strong>, which lets them
stand up, shift 3 squares, and make 3 shortsword attacks against an enemy. The
attacks use the basic profile, but also do half-damage on a miss.</p>

<p>Once the grifter hits 0 HP, they can use <strong>The Jig is Up</strong> as an interrupt. They
retain their last hit point and can shift 3 squares, likely as a prelude to
running away at full speed.</p>

<h3 id="lower-quays-guttersnipe">Lower Quays Guttersnipe</h3>

<p>Guttersnipes usually act as lookouts and spies, but are not adverse to a spot of
murder if needed. They’re Level 2 Artillery with 30 HP. This one’s a halfling.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that the guttersnipe <em>doesn’t</em> need to be adjacent to
an enemy to benefit from River Rat tactics! As long as at least one ally is
adjacent to that enemy, the guttersnipe can shoot them with combat advantage.</p>

<p>They also have the <strong>Sniper</strong> trait, which lets them stay hidden if they miss
with a ranged attack from hiding.</p>

<p>Those ranged attacks will be made with <strong>Slings</strong>. If enemies get too close for
comfort, the guttersnipe can toss a <strong>Hooked Net</strong>, which acts as a Close Blast
2 that restrains and deals 5 ongoing damage to those it hits (save ends). They
only have one of these, though, and after it’s spent they’ll need to resort to
weak-sauce <strong>Gut Punches</strong> to discourage melee attackers.</p>

<p>They also have the halfling Second Chance power.</p>

<h3 id="razorclaw-jack">Razorclaw Jack</h3>

<p>Jacks are part of the Rat’s beefier contingent, and specialize in burglary and
kidnapping. This one’s a Razorclaw shifter, and a Level 3 Skirmisher with 43
HP. When they’re bloodied, <strong>Razorclaw Shifting</strong> gives them a +2 bonus to
Speed, taking it from 6 to 8.</p>

<p>The jack fights with their <strong>claws</strong>, which deal extra damage if they have
combat advantage. They can also use the River Rat’s Gambit technique. If
conditions are right (recharge 4+) they can use <strong>Skulduggery</strong> to shift half
its speed as a move action and gain combat advantage against enemies adjacent to
them at the end of the movement. This combat advantage lasts until the end of
the current turn, so the movement must come before an attack.</p>

<h3 id="lowtown-kneebreaker">Lowtown Kneebreaker</h3>

<p>Kneebreakers are pure muscle, sent to rough people up or kill them when the time
for subtlety is past. This one’s a human, and a Level 3 Brute with 56 HP.</p>

<p>They fight with <strong>Clubs</strong>, can use River Rat’s Gambit, and can do what their
name says as part of a <strong>Crippling Strike</strong> (recharge 6+), which deals extra
damage and slows (save ends). It still does half damage on a miss.</p>

<h3 id="kelson">Kelson</h3>

<p>The leader of the River Rats has the only stat block in this entry with an Evil
alignment. Everyone else is Unaligned. I take this to mean that the River Rats
are motivated primarily by loyalty to each other, but that Kelson is exploiting
that loyalty for his own profit. He’s a Level 5 Elite Skirmisher with the Leader
tag and 120 HP.</p>

<p>Kelson’s skills as a <strong>Gang Leader</strong> act as an aura (3) that gives allies inside
a +2 bonus to saves. He fights with a <strong>Short Sword</strong> and throws poisoned
<strong>Daggers</strong> that deal damage and inflict 5 ongoing poison damage on a hit (save
ends). The <strong>Flickering Blades</strong> at-will maneuver lets him make a shortsword
attack, shift 3 squares, and throw a dagger at someone else, all within the same
standard action.</p>

<p>He can also use River Rat’s Gambit and Second Chance.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The River Rats are mostly a pretty standard thieves’ guild and are a good tool
for GMs who want to add a bit of urban adventuring to 4e’s standard
points-of-light setup. They’re more straightforward and less problematic than
the Fell Court, and also a bit more morally ambiguous. Most of the River Rats
are in this business simply to make a living and take care of their found
family. This means it’s possible for diplomatic PCs to dismantle the gang using
mostly non-violent means!</p>

<p>They’d need to befriend its rank-and-file members, make them turn against
Kelson, and give them the material conditions to leaver their criminal careers
behind for good. More complex than the usual “kill’em all” approach, but
potentially much more satisfying. Of course, less scrupulous but still
diplomatic PCs might end up just replacing Kelson as the boss instead of ending
the Rats’ criminal activities.</p>
