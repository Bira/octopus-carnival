    <p>A while ago I posted a compilation of methods and tools for <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html">underwater
adventuring</a>. In this post, I’ll add a few items and artifacts that further
help with that or that make sense as possessions for underwater people. This is
a grab-bag article without much direction, but I hope it will be useful
nonetheless.</p>

<h2 id="alchemical-pills">Alchemical Pills</h2>

<p>Any drinkable concoction (including magic potions) might be made as a solid pill
instead. Pills tend to be round, thumbnail sized, hard, and meant to be
swallowed whole. Pills are popular with alchemists and herbalists who don’t have
a line to a crystal vial supplier, and with underwater civilizations since
liquid potions don’t really work there.</p>

<p>A pill costs the same as the equivalent liquid potion. It’s waterproof and not
at risk of breaking from falls and the like, but it also can’t be put into
bandoliers for easy access during combat. Dry-swallowing a pill during a fight
requires either two Ready maneuvers or a single maneuver and a HT roll.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> put each of your pills into a separately-purchased crystal vial (DF1
p. 111) in order to have them in your potion belt, but that does add an extra
Ready maneuver to the process of ingesting it since you have to open the vial
first.</p>

<h2 id="elixir-of-water-breathing">Elixir of Water Breathing</h2>

<p>This alchemical elixir can be found on GURPS Magic, and is “reprinted” here with
additional options. It’s a drinkable potion that lets you breathe underwater as
if you had Gills for 1d hours.</p>

<p>The GM rolls the die in secret when you drink it, and you remain unaware of how
long you have… until 5 minutes before that time expires, when you get an
instinctive mental warning that you only have 5 minutes left.</p>

<p>GMs who dislike the randomness can set a fixed duration based on how much they
want their PCs to spend on these potions. I suggest from 1 to 3 hours.</p>

<p>Purely aquatic people can instead get Elixirs of <em>Air</em> Breathing for the same
price and with the equivalent effect for air. Both variants are very likely to
be found in pill form (see above).</p>

<p>In all cases, the potion is $600, 0.25kg (0.5 lbs).</p>

<h2 id="coral-items-4-cf">Coral Items (+4 CF)</h2>

<p>Coral is a new implausible material: items made from it have a somewhat porous
texture but are covered in intricate natural patterns of bright colors. Coral
comes in rough or polished varieties, though both cost the same. Surfacers value
it because it’s pretty, underwater civilizations value it for its incidental
properties.</p>

<p>Coral items can be made without fire, though they do require special magic and
techniques known to underwater armorers. They also have neutral buoyancy: their
weight does not count towards Encumbrance when determining the user’s penalty to
Swimming. Anything that’s usually made of metal or wood can be made of coral
instead. Being made of coral adds +4 CF to the item’s total cost.</p>

<h2 id="artifact-atlantean-armbands">Artifact: Atlantean Armbands</h2>

<p>Origin: Divine.</p>

<p>This is a pair of gilded orichalcum armbands decorated with reliefs of sharks
and other marine creatures. The Atlantean Armbands were said to be a gift of the
gods to a human hero destined to become the queen of a great underwater
nation. That did indeed happen, and since all of the queen’s descendants were
born with the ability to live underwater the armbands became honored museum
pieces.</p>

<p>That ancient empire has long since fallen to the tides of history, so who knows
where these artifacts might surface next?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sell Price</strong>: $50.000.</li>
  <li><strong>Weight</strong>: 0.5kg (1 lb) for the pair.</li>
  <li><strong>Power Item Capacity</strong>: 20 FP.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When worn (one in each arm), they allow the wielder to freely breathe and move
underwater as if they had the Gills and Amphibious traits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If used as power items, any FP from the armbands that’s spent on the Swim and
Breathe Water spells is worth double the energy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="variations">Variations</h3>

<p>Some legends tell of another pair of armbands, of silver-plated orichalcum and
decorated with land-animal motifs, that would allow an aquatic wearer to breathe
air and walk on land, assuming a humanoid form if necessary. These were created
by an evil but powerful witch for a mermaid that wanted to walk among humans,
and are Druidic in origin.</p>

<p>Instead of armbands, you could have rings, piercings, or amulets with the same
enchantments.</p>
