    <p>This chapter starts the GM-focused part of the book. The factions presented here
are the “other half” of all the plots hinted at in the character themes -
they’re what the themes are hooking into. This chapter will contain a lot of
information players won’t know at the start of the campaign.</p>

<p>There are five major factions operating in the Neverwinter region during this
campaign:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New Neverwinter</strong>: Dagult Neverember and his mercenary army, who want to
become the legitimate rulers of the city.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Abolethic Sovereignity</strong>: A sect from this aberrant empire is experimenting
with a pocket of the Spellplague beneath the city with the eventual goal of
using it to control the sleeping primordial Maegera.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A cult of Asmodeus worshipers, also known as <strong>Ashmadai</strong>, is plotting to take
over the region for themselves but is in for a whole bunch of nasty surprises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>Thayans</strong> want to create an undead army and possibly complete their
genocidal plans from thirty years ago.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>Netherese</strong> want to repair the flying island of Xinlenal and use it as
the center of their new empire.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from these, there are many other smaller factions centered around either
the city of Neverwinter, like the rebel remnants, or around the Neverwinter
Wood, like the Uthgardt or the angry eladrin of Ilyianbruen.</p>

<p>Each major faction gets their own section consisting of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A general overview of who they are.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A detailed explanation of their goals. This includes text boxes with Theme
Tie-Ins that could lead the faction to interact with the PCs or
vice-versa. Some are obvious, others less so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A summary of their relationship to other major factions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A discussion of what encounters against them look like, complete with
statistics for their important figures and any new monsters that might make up
their rank-and-file.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As the introduction says, everybody’s levels are calibrated to fit in a
Heroic-tier campaign, and none of the plots and goals detailed here are set in
stone. Some of the faction descriptions include text boxes musing about
alternate setups, or what happens if the faction’s plots are seriously derailed.</p>

<p>The minor factions get less space for themselves, but they still get some and
we’ll be looking at all of them in the order they appear on the book.</p>

<p>Each major faction is going to be split into two posts here. The first will look
at their general description, goals, relationships, PC tie-ins and my
impressions of them. The second will deal with the Encounters section of their
writeup, which tends to be pretty long and often includes new monster stat
blocks.</p>
