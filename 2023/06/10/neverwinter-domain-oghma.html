    <p>Oghma is the Forgotten Realms god of knowledge, occupying the same conceptual
slot as Ioun does on the default 4e setting. His purview includes knowledge,
inspiration, and discovery. His followers believe that to serve him is to serve
the truth.</p>

<p>The stats for this domain can also be used for priests of the god Gond, which I
think is an artificer god?</p>

<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h2>

<p>Oghma’s powers focus on boosting allies’ skill checks by granting them bonuses
or rerolls, and on penalizing enemy attacks and saves. Its main distinction from
other domains is that its attack powers focus on doing <em>psychic</em> damage instead
of Radiant, though one of your at-wills still does radiant and thunder damage.</p>

<p>The old character optimization forums rate this domain as pretty good, though
they say it takes until the mid-Paragon tier to really get going: its level 11
feature makes that radiant and thunder at-will immobilize on a hit, and its
level 16 one makes your Healing Word grant the target a free basic attack. You
should still be able to do just fine in a standard Heroic-only Neverwinter
campaign, though.</p>

<p>As you might expect, this theme combos well with the Oghma’s Faithful. The
domain’s first-level feature lets you use Wisdom to make Int-based skill checks,
and the skill-boosting abilities from the theme will let you easily become the
party’s encyclopedia.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I don’t have much to say about this domain that hasn’t been said above
already. Oghma isn’t a particularly exciting FR deity to me, though this
campaign does give his clerics some pretty nice hooks. The domain’s powers could
easily be used for priests of Ioun in a campaign in the core setting.</p>
