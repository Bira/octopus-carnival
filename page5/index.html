            <p>This part gives an overview of the fabled lost city of Gauntlgrym,and goes into
detail about its “upper” strata.</p>

<h2 id="historical-errata">Historical Errata</h2>

<p>There’s another bit I missed when I glossed over the big-ass timeline at the
beginning of the book, and now I must correct that here.</p>

<p>The dwarves of Gauntlgrym found the primordial Maegera early in their habitation
of the city, but they left her sealed up for a few hundred years before messing
with her.</p>

<p>The massive project that bound her into a sort of arcane power generator was a
three-way joint project between the dwarves, the mages of Illusk and the elves
of Iliyanbruen. As we saw in the post about Shandarar, they were still around
for a few centuries after the fall of Netheril, so they took part in this as
well. The book describes this as a positive example of what the three peoples
can do when they work together, though it outlived their friendship.</p>

<p>Maegera’s power allowed the dwarves of Delzoun to create inumerable wonders, in
the form of both potent magical items and marvelous works of infrastructure for
their capital and their empire. Gauntlgrym became a big center of trade and even
saw numerous human families moving there.</p>

<p>The reason it fell was because of the Orc Marches, a massive region-wide
invasion by an army of orcs larger than any seen before or since. By the time
this happened, the three peoples were no longer on speaking terms, as each had
grown more arrogant and mistrustful over time. They could have banded together
to repel the invasion, but each thought they could go it alone. Illusk fell
first, and Delzoun was next, and only at the gates of Shandarar was the
already-weakened orc army repelled.</p>

<p>Iliyanbruen would end up dismantling anyway when it tried to take the fight to
the orcs in Illusk, as we saw earlier. Gauntlgrym was left alone since no one
seemed to be coming up from there. Its dwarven and humans refugees scattered all
over the Realms, with many of the humans joining Uthgardt tribes on the surface
and the dwarves ranging out further to move to their surviving nations.</p>

<p>The empire of Delzoun and its capital of Gauntlgrym are today kinda like the
dwarven equivalent of the Roman Empire in that stupid meme. No dwarf living
today has ever laid eyes on the lost city, but they think of it regularly and
describe it as the height of their civilization.</p>

<h2 id="gauntlgrym-today">Gauntlgrym Today</h2>

<p>Despite being lost to the surface, Gauntlgrym did not remain static in all these
millennia. The orcs were kicked out by mind flayers; the mind flayers by derro;
and the derro by duergar. That last one happened fairly recently in historical
terms, so the duergar still consider themselves masters of the place. However,
they are not the only people living there. There are other groups seeking to
control the city, and literal multitudes of ghosts belonging to its original
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the city from the outside in.</p>

<h3 id="the-great-cavern">The Great Cavern</h3>

<p>Whatever paths to Gauntlgrym exist in your campaign, they will always end
here. This is a massive natural cavern filled with alien Underdark vegetation
and labyrinthine formations of stone pillars and stalagmites. Small forts and
balconies are carved into the walls and around the largest pillars - the remains
of former guard posts. The bones of ancient battles litter the floor.</p>

<p>There’s a small lake at the center of the cave, and on one of its walls stands
the massive mithral gate that leads into Gauntlgrym proper. It’s nearly
impossible to open by mundane or magical means, but a true heir of Delzoun can
open it with the slightest push. The cave is filled with your preferred
selection of Underdark monsters, and also with two sapient factions.</p>

<p>The first is a group of old Ashmadai who came here with Valindra when she first
tried to free the primordial in that Drizzt novel. The tunnels they used filled
with magma at the end of that, so they became trapped here. Their first reaction
to any strangers they spot is violence, though some of them might be prepared to
surrender or betray the rest in exchange for a way back to the surface.</p>

<p>The second faction is the House Xorlarrin expedition, who arrived recently and
built a hidden camp. They’re spying on the Ashmadai while looking for a way to
open the gates. Their reaction to intruding PCs will be to remain hidden and spy
on them as well, waiting to see if they can open the gates. If they can, the
drow will follow them covertly, scattering if spotted, and will only attack if
the PCs become distracted by some other enemy inside the city.</p>

<h3 id="the-iron-tabernacle">The Iron Tabernacle</h3>

<p>The Iron Tabernacle was Gauntlgrym’s temple district, and was both the city’s
physical and spiritual center. Its many temples and shrines were dedicated to
Moradin and other good gods, and attended by a sizable contingent of dwarven and
human priests. This enormous multi-leveled district was a marvelous sight to
behold in its glory days, but now most of it lies ravaged by both time and by
duergar impiety. The city’s new occupants have defaced every religious image and
statue they could find, and stolen anything of value here, from precious relics
to the mithral trim in the walls.</p>

<p>Still, the Tabernacle is so vast that some hidden shrines remain untouched and
could be reconsecrated by PCs. There’s a text box here detailing the minor boons
they can gain from doing so. An extended rest next to the restored shrine takes
only three hours instead of six, and has no danger of being interrupted by
wandering monsters. And if a member of the party is a non-evil dwarf or a
worshiper of Moradin, they might gain the attention of one of the city’s ghosts,
who will help them in battle the next time they fight (using a level-appropriate
incorporeal undead stat block). Both benefits only happen once.</p>

<p>The Tabernacle is also the hub of Gaunglgrym’s ancient mine rail network. The
rails connect directly or indirectly to every other district in the city, and
are meant to be traveled by self-propelled mine carts that were used for bulk
cargo transport back in the day. They still run according to their ancient
schedules and could be commandeered by PCs. A big switching station in the
Tabernacle can let them switch carts from one track to another. It’s an easy
way to get around this vast city.</p>

<p>Or perhaps not so easy - there are some rules here that might come into play
when a fight happens during a cart ride, or when a cart <em>derails</em> during a
fight.</p>

<h3 id="ancient-cemetery">Ancient Cemetery</h3>

<p>The lowest level of the Tabernacle is a massive collection of crypts, laid out
according to a now forgotten scheme or tradition. Some are simple, some very
elaborate, but all of them have the names, titles, and lineage of their
occupants carved on their stone.</p>

<p>Unlike the upper levels, the crypts are intact. The many, many ghosts who roam
the place attack any would-be vandals and thieves en masse, so the duergar stay
away from here.</p>

<p>The ghosts will not bother the PCs at first, but will attack as above if they
try to damage or steal from the crypts. The group should take care to remain on
their best behavior while in this area.</p>

<h2 id="theme-tie-ins-and-impressions">Theme Tie-Ins and Impressions</h2>

<p>The PC theme that’s most interested in Gauntlgrym is definitely the Heir of
Delzoun. Finding this place is their life’s goal, so if your party includes one
or more Heirs Gauntlgrym is going to be a vitally important place for the
campaign.</p>

<p>For the Heir and most other characters who might be interested in finding the
city, the true treasure here is all the historical and genealogical information
contained in the crypt walls. It’s a major archaeological finding all by itself,
which is reason enough for Oghma’s Faithful, but it’s even more valuable to the
Heir and perhaps even to the Neverwinter Noble. All dwarves, and a lot of human
nobles, keep pretty detailed genealogies of their own clans and families and
these would be easy to connect to the ones in display here.</p>

<p>If the Noble could prove that their house is older than Neverwinter itself, then
they might have an unassailable claim to the throne! And if the Heir’s ancestors
are important enough, they might have a strong claim to <em>Gauntlgrym’s</em> throne,
or perhaps to that of one of its successor states.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone would be happy with these findings. There are plenty of
dwarven nobles out there who built their prestige on forged lineages, and who
would not want the world to discover this fact. And many others who would be
more than happy to pull a Beloq and kill the PCs before they can announce their
findings to the world, so that they can claim the credit.</p>

<p>The “default” way to arrive at Gauntlgrym is to navigate the river of flame
beneath Mount Hotenow, but there could be other paths as well. Maybe they could
take a detour through Hotenow’s Shadowfell reflection, or maybe there’s a
mystical path similar to Shadowfell Road that takes those who follow it properly
to the mithral gates.</p>

<p>In the next post, we dig too greedily and too deep.</p>

<p>The Coiled Spring is an amulet made of brass. It’s disc shaped and about an inch
thick. On its front, there is a relief of a snake eating its own tail, the
classic Ouroboros. The inside of the ring formed by the snake is a clear crystal
panel, through which can be seen a spring like that of a watch.</p>

<p>That spring can store up to ten Fatigue Points which can be used to enable
bursts of extra effort - most often <em>Extra Effort in Combat</em> (p. B357), but also
other athletic feats. The stored FP can only be used for those purposes, and is
not affected by negative effects that would sap the user’s own FP. In other
words, it works just like the Heroic Reserves advantage from <strong>GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy 20: Slayers</strong>, and <em>almost</em> like a power item for martial characters.</p>

<p>The main difference between the Coiled Spring and a normal Power Item is that it
hijacks the natural recovery processes of the wearer’s body in order to “wind”
itself, and cannot be recharged by the usual methods for power items. While the
Spring is not at full capacity, its wearer is unable to recover their own
Fatigue Points, and the amulet gains 1 FP every 10 minutes. This is a constant
rate - traits which speed up FP recovery for the wearer have no effect on the
amulet. The wearer regains their usual ability to rest when the amulet is fully
charged, or when it’s removed (which stops the charging process).</p>

<p>While this does mean recharging the Coiled Spring in town is effectively free,
it can make dungeon delving more complicated for martial characters,
particularly if the GM enforces rules like fatigue costs for fighting a battle
(p. B426 or DF Exploits p. 60). Characters who normally can’t use Fatigue Points
can wear the Coiled Spring and use it to benefit from the Extra Effort rules in
and out of combat, though they can’t recharge it.</p>

<p>Scholars who know of the Spring speculate that it was originally meant  to allow
golems and other constructs to surpass their limits. In an adventure, it will
most likely be found worn by such a construct, or by an elite warrior who
figured out it works just as well for organics. If found in a chest or hoard,
though, it will always start out empty.</p>

<p>If the delvers try to sell the Coiled Spring, or if you decide it’s available in
shops, its monetary value is twice that of a Power Item of the same
capacity. That’s $3400 for the 10 FP version described here, though you could
have versions with greater or smaller capacity. Note that you <em>can’t</em> double-dip
and use the Coiled Spring as a Power Item.</p>

<p>Variant Springs are possible. Maybe the Flywheel of Faith can power divine
magic, the Arcane Array wizardly spells, and the Goddess Gyre druidic ones. The
recharging mechanics and all other restrictions are the same. They could allow a
construct who can’t normally cast spells or use casting magical items due to a
lack of FP to do so.</p>

<p>Whether called a hacker, a decker, or a netrunner, the person who invades
computer systems and makes them do things features prominently in the stories
most cyberpunk RPGs take inspiration from, and so often ends up being a vitally
important archetype in those games. However, they tend to have a very mixed
track record when it comes to actually presenting you with a hacking system
that’s fun and bug-free.</p>

<p>This means there are many possible reasons for why you might find yourself
planning a cyberpunk game but have no cause or wish to use its hacking
rules. Maybe none of the players wants to be a hacker, or maybe the group just
doesn’t like the rules of the game in question. In those cases, a popular
suggestion is to include a NPC hacker, and in this post we’ll discuss a way to
do so that keeps the rest of the group reasonably involved in the hacking. Rules
are for GURPS, but the concepts can be easily translated to other systems.</p>

<h2 id="work-from-home">Work From Home</h2>

<p>The current best practice in games that include hacker PCs is to devise ways to
keep the hacker together with the rest of the party, so that they can fully
participate in the game even when it’s not hacking time. When your group’s
hacker is an NPC, however, the best thing to do is the opposite. Hacker NPCs
should always do their thing remotely.</p>

<p>Managing NPCs who constantly accompany the party is a tricky affair. A character
who’s much weaker than the party runs the risk of turning the adventure into a
video-game-style escort quest, one of the most reviled types of mission in
existence. One who is strong enough to protect themselves can end up becoming a
GMPC, a label reserved for annoying characters who overshadow the players and
make them feel like the support cast of someone else’s story.</p>

<p>All of this is subjective, which makes it even trickier. Your group’s fun will
be hurt if they <em>feel</em> either of those scenarios is happening, even if the math
is well-balanced.</p>

<p>A remote hacker removes most of the risk. They’re in communication with the
group, and they can do the jobs covered by their niche, but any other challenge
that can be handled by the PC’s own skills <em>should</em> be, even if it’s
technological in nature. And there are things the hacker can only do with
on-site support from the PCs, which keeps them involved in the actual hack even
if you’re not engaging with those rules.</p>

<p>The exact nature of these support tasks depends on how your specific setting
handles computers and hacking. Most games either go the same Retro way of early
Shadowrun and CP2020, or a more “Modern” way that uses more recent tropes such
as the ones employed by Shadowrun 4th Edition or CP2077. We’ll look at how you
can accommodate a remote NPC hacker in both.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-another-timeline">The Future of Another Timeline</h2>

<p>It’s not immediately obvious to us here in 2023, but the earliest iterations of
Shadowrun’s Matrix and CP2020’s NET were based on a pre-Internet model of
networked computing. Strip all the futuristic terms from their description and
you’ll find out you’re dealing with 80s mainframes. This lies at the root of a
lot of things there that can look a bit weird or silly to modern
readers<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Here’s a short and approximately correct explanation for how that
works:</p>

<p>Mainframes are huge (and hugely expensive) computers that are usually
responsible for handling all data processing for an entire company or
organization. They were the dominant form of institutional computing from around
the 1950s to at least the early 1990s, and never really went away.</p>

<p>A mainframe is operated through remote terminals, which can be in the same
building or even off-site. Therefore, it must be ready to receive connections
and requests from these terminals. And the way you do that in the 80s is through
phone lines and modems. They do have <em>internal</em> security measures to
authenticate users and prevent one user from seeing or changing other users’
data, but there is no such thing as a firewall because permanent Internet
connections are not yet a thing for mainframes. The most security you can add to
the connection step is to keep the numbers for your mainframe’s phone lines
unlisted<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>And this is why both Shadowrun’s and CP2020’s descriptions of their “global
nets” are so concerned about splitting them into geographical regions and
assigning codes to them and the servers within them. That net is not the
<em>Internet</em>, but a world-spanning phone circuit. The first step to hacking
into that corporate mainframe is to dial the unlisted number of its modem<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="old-school-remote-hacking">Old-School Remote Hacking</h3>

<p>When you have a PC hacker in these more “retro” games, the number of the
target’s modem line might be included with the mission briefing, letting them
hack removely. It’s more likely that no number is included, then the hacker has
to go in with the group and find an terminal in the target facility through
which they could connect.</p>

<p>With a hacker NPC and they have the number, the reason the adventure is
happening at all is because the mission objectives have a physical component
that must happen at the same time. The typical setup is that you need to steal
the physical prototype while the hacker grabs the research files.</p>

<p>If they don’t have the number, then <em>discovering</em> the number becomes one of the
physical mission objectives! The place the PCs are infiltrating might not even
have any direct relation to the real, final objective, but it could be a place
that also uses the same mainframe remotely. The number is going to be written
down somewhere in there, either in an official manual, some employee’s personal
notes or even a scrap of paper that was carelessly thrown away<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Some
non-VR-dungeon hacking of a physical terminal to peek at its configuration might
be necessary, which might be resolved by a couple of rolls since dumb terminals
are less secure than the mainframe they talk to. Or you might need to find a way
to scam the info out of an someone who works there (“social engineering”).</p>

<p>This fact-finding expedition could be a whole adventure in itself, or it might
just be an intermediate step in a more complex operation where the group must
also infiltrate the final target facility at the same time as the hacker does
their thing, as outlined above.</p>

<h2 id="twenty-minutes-from-now">Twenty Minutes From Now</h2>

<p>More recent cyberpunk games tend to base their networks on the real-world
Internet and the technologies that support it. This means that every individual
device attached to a network is effectively a full-feature computer, be it an
employee’s workstation, a security camera, or a guard’s smartphone. Different
departments have their own private servers and their own internal network that
doesn’t necessarily connect to the others or to the outside world.</p>

<p>Less sensitive facilities might allow employees to work remotely from their
homes or from other buildings by letting them connect via <em>virtual private
networks</em>. These connections to happen over the Internet, but they’re encrypted
and protected from general snooping. Realistically, our dastardly hacker would
need to steal valid credentials to be able to access a VPN.</p>

<p>On the other extreme, a top-secret secure facility might be <em>air-gapped</em>, which
means it’s isolated and sealed in such a way that no signal can enter or leave
the building. None of its internal networks are connected to the outside world,
and they are not connected to each other either unless this is absolutely
necessary. The servers controlling the security system are isolated from the
servers housing sensitive data. Each has its own independent set of protections.</p>

<p>This is both realistic according to our contemporary understanding of network
security, and an excellent way to make sure PC hackers stick with the group and
have plenty to do once inside. Individual hacking attempts tend to be shorter
but more numerous, and made against devices that are within the hacker’s
immediate reach<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. Shadowrun 4th Edition goes deep into this (5th and onwards
go back to the retro model), and it’s also more or less how things work in
Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<h3 id="new-school-remote-hacking">New-School Remote Hacking</h3>

<p>In an environment so full of incentives for the hacker to stick with the party,
how can you accommodate a remote NPC hacker?</p>

<p>If the target facility has a VPN that contains the data you want, then many of
the same “classic” techniques for acquiring those old-school mainframe phone
numbers might also work to acquire valid VPN credentials, allowing the NPC to
hack the place remotely.</p>

<p>If it doesn’t have a VPN or is completely isolated, then we need to resort to
quantum bullshit. Below we’ll see GURPS stats for the bullshit in question,
imported directly from Warframe. It’s easily usable in other systems, though.</p>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/CorpusDatamass.webp" width=200/>
  <figcaption>A datamass.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A <strong>datamass</strong> is a device similar in concept to the causality communicator in
Ultra-Tech page 45, but <em>much</em> cheaper. It consists of an armored,
briefcase-sized device that incorporates several kinds of data cable plus laser
and IR micro-communicators and a small radio (GURPS Ultratech pages 43-44). All
of these are connected to a sizable amount of quantum-entangled matter.</p>

<p>Datamasses are made in entangled pairs that allow high-bandwidth communication
and data transfer between elements of the pair through any amount of barriers or
interference. They have DR 10, HP 8, cost $5000 for the pair, weight 5kg (10 lb)
each, and are LC1 (AKA <em>super illegal</em>). They also include an emergency
self-destruct switch that melts the internals of both elements of the pair and
can be triggered from either side.</p>

<p>In your typical cyberpunk setting, datamasses were first invented as
super-secret espionage tools by a major government or computer-focused megacorp,
and initially gave them a major leg up in one of the many ongoing cold wars
between such entities. The secret of their existence soon leaked, however, and
an enterprising independent engineer figured out they were quite easy to make
with a properly modified home 3d printer. Yes, even the entangled matter. The
plans for a home-baked datamasses were soon made widely available on the Net,
and they keep popping up no matter how much effort the corps spend to squash
them. That’s why they’re relatively cheap.</p>

<p>Datamass technology is going to be really revolutionary when FTL travel is
invented in the distant future, but for now it’s mostly used for its original
purpose, and allows teams of plucky street mercs like the PCs to operate at the
same level as crack corporate commandos when it comes to high-level
espionage. If the PCs are hired to do a hacking mission, they will usually be
provided a datamass pair. PCs can also buy their own through the usual illegal
channels available to PCs in these games. It should be difficult, but not
impossible.</p>

<p>In a setting that has datamasses, hacking missions look a lot like the Warframe
“mobile defense” missions these devices come from. The PCs need to sneak into
the target facility carrying a datamass, and find a place where to connect it. A
direct cable connection to a machine in the target network is best. A wi-fi
connection will do in a pinch, but will make everything that follows take
longer.</p>

<p>Since the hacker is an NPC, you don’t need to roll anything for the actual
hack - you just need to give the PCs a time frame for when it will be done. And
then they must stay near the datamass and guard it until that much time has
elapsed. If they snuck in, they need to find a way to maintain stealth and
divert security attention from their access point. If they’re found out, it
turns into a fight, but they still must stay until the hack is done or it will
fail. For added Fun(TM), a difficult mission might require the party to do this
several times from different access points.</p>

<p>The self-destruct switch is useful for when the hack is done, as it allows the
party to leave without having to lug the datamass back out. It can also prevent
the hacker from being traced if the device is captured. Or it can be used in a
double-cross that leaves the team stranded in enemy territory without network
support. Use that last one sparingly!</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/10/06/neverwinter-hotenow.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: Mount Hotenow</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Mount Hotenow is a huge barely-dormant volcano on the southeast end of the
Crags, in Neverwinter Wood. The heat it produces is the reason the region’s
rivers never freeze, and therefore it’s at the root of Neverwinter’s
prosperity. It was also the cause of its downfall 27 years ago, when a Thayan
ritual caused it to erupt.</p>

<p>Even before the cataclysm Mount Hotenow was already the subject of many rumors
and legends. It’s an opening to Hell; it’s an opening to the Elemental Chaos;
demons live here; giants live here; dragons live here; and so on. The most
recent tale is that anyone who enters one of Hotenow’s many caves is fated to
die within a year, even if they make it out.</p>

<h2 id="fire-cultists">Fire Cultists</h2>

<p>Though the original mountain in the middle world is back to its pre-cataclysm
state, its reflection on the Shadowfell has been spewing a slow and steady
stream of lava since the cataclysm. Some people believe that this shadow
eruption could cause one in the middle world if the barriers between planes wear
thin enough. Such a state of constant eruption would spell doom for Neverwinter.</p>

<p>Chief among these believers are the many elemental fire creatures that do indeed
make Mount Hotenow their home. They’re led by the hunchbacked fire giant
Gommoth, who has lived here since he was banished from his clan. The eruption 27
years ago was a major ecstatic experience to him and to every other fire
creature who lived here, and since then Gommoth started a cult dedicated to
making it happen again.</p>

<p>The ecstatic experience happened because it was Maegera’s near-awakening that
caused the eruption, and her power tugged at the elementals’ primordial
nature. Gommoth doesn’t know this, but the cult’s latest rising star probably
does. This is Qualthus, the shadovar outcast. Remember him? He was banished from
Xinlenal after being blamed for the accidental sabotage of their mythallar. True
to the general disposition of his former buddies, Qualthus has decided that the
best way to remedy this injustice is to cause Mount Hotenow to erupt again and
bury Xinlenal in lava.</p>

<p>He’s confident he can do it. After all he’s an arcanist of the Netherese
tradition (read: a megalomaniacal asshole). His actual chances are incredibly
small, after all it took the full might of the Dread Ring to make it happen the
first time. But he could get lucky, since Maegera’s bonds are weakened.</p>

<p>To represent Gommoth, the book suggests using an ogre mercenary stat block with
added fire resistance, increased Charisma, and with attacks doing fire
damage. You could also level down a standard fire giant stat block to make him
fit with the campaign’s level range.</p>

<h2 id="the-river-of-flame">The River Of Flame</h2>

<p>Deep underground, beneath the territory of the fire cultists, there is a river
of liquid flame. This isn’t poetic language or a metaphor for magma, but a
literal description. The river follows a winding subterranean path, and the
important thing for player characters is that it passes by a tunnel that leads
directly to Gauntlgrym.</p>

<p>PCs who know where to disembark could take some sort of fireproof boat or
submersible through this river, and arrive at the lost city. Their main
challenge here besides the hostile environment is Karrundax, the very
territorial young red dragon who lairs in the area.</p>

<h2 id="seekers-of-the-way">Seekers of the Way</h2>

<p>One thing that happens repeatedly in this book is that a theme description in
Chapter 2 will give us the impression that the PC in question is the only one
doing something, and then a faction or location description further down the
line will give us a whole group of NPCs with the same goal, and that’s going to
be the first time we hear of these NPCs.</p>

<p>This might be a disconnect between different authors, or it might be a sort of
soft “Player’s Guide/Campaign Setting” separation within the same book, since
presumably you want PCs to choose a theme without seeing any spoilers about what
they’ll encounter during the campaign. Whatever the case, we now run into the
group that ties to the Heir of Delzoun, and it’s a genuine Dwarf Fortress
expedition!</p>

<p>The Heir’s description actively lied to the player: they’re not one of the last
dwarves who are still looking for the lost city. In reality there are so many
that after their disparate teams and groups joined together to coordinate their
efforts they had to elect a government to keep them organized. Their newly
elected leader decided that Mount Hotenow was their best bet, since there were
many stories connecting it to Gauntlgrym and a few confirmed Delzoun outposts on
its slopes.</p>

<p>This extremely large expedition set out from Neverwinter before the Heir got
here, and the litany of setbacks and tragedies they experienced along the way is
what gives me that Fun (TM) Dwarf Fortress vibe.</p>

<p>First they bought a letter of safe passage from Neverember in order to pass
through Many-Arrows territory unharmed, but the dwarves and orcs just couldn’t
resist provoking each other until hostilities broke out.</p>

<p>Then they arrived at the Wood and lost yet more dwarves to eladrin arrows and
miscellaneous monsters. Either Shandarar’s guardians were particularly
trigger-happy or it was those old rivalries flaring up again.</p>

<p>Then they got to the volcano and lost a bunch more dwarves to Gommoth’s cult.</p>

<p>And now they’re stuck at the river of flame. Can’t forge ahead because no one
packed a fireproof submersible, can’t retreat because the survivors aren’t sure
they can make it back to Neverwinter alive. To say that morale is low is a
massive understatement.</p>

<p>Morale would be even lower if the expedition’s leader, Vandra Hillborn, revealed
the terrible secret she’s keeping. Many of the dwarves “lost” to the elementals
actually <em>defected</em> to them, and now work together to bring about the volcano’s
next eruption. Hillborn believes they cracked under the strain of the trip and
went insane, but the truth is even worse: they were intentionally driven insane
by the Gauntlgrym mind-flayers through remote telepathy. The flayers believe
that a volcanic eruption is just the thing to permanently block access to
Gauntlgrym and prevent any meddlers from finding it.</p>

<p>As we already know, the mind flayers are themselves being controlled by the
aboleths, so we have a true conspiracy onion here.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>There are several ways to discover Gauntlgrym’s precise location elsewhere, but
the River of Flame under Mount Hotenow appears to be the most viable path to
actually go there. The fate of the dwarven expedition is a good blueprint of
what an overland journey from Neverwinter to here would involve.</p>

<p>It’s possible to have an entire party of PCs who would be more interested in
pursuing this journey than dealing with the other hooks in the setting: not just
one or more Heirs of Delzoun but also perhaps one of Oghma’s Faithful who’s
really into archaeology, a Dead Rat Deserter who’s after the score of the
century, and even a Neverwinter Noble in a campaign where finding Gauntlgrym
will give them the popular acclaim they need to take the throne. If there’s an
extended detour to deal with the eladrin, then perhaps the Iliyanbruen Guardian
can get into the mix too.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This post covers the city itself and several nearby locations related to the
Gray Wolf Uthgardt, who serve the Netherese.</p>

<h2 id="content-warning-brutal-savages-nonsense">Content Warning: “Brutal Savages” nonsense</h2>

<p>There is a lot of Gray Wolf material in this section, and this is where the
mounting inconsistencies in their portrayal start to get in the way. The stuff
about them that I read so far gave me the impression of a people who were mostly
minding their own business before the Netherese turned their leaders into
fascist assholes. Most of the actual tribe members were not happy with the
situation: a significant number of them had defected, and those who hadn’t were
open to persuasion by a PC like the Pack Outcast.</p>

<p>This section drops most of that and goes all in on the “brutal savages who
disdain civilization” cliches, painting the Gray Wolf as being bad guys even
before the Netherese got to them. After being co-opted, they got even worse.
Anyone who’s still a member of the tribe at this point is either on board with
the cruelty or too cowardly to ever stand against it. Even their guardian
spirits are disgusted with them.</p>

<p>I’m going to report what the book says below, but I personally would completely
change it were I to run a Neverwinter campaign.</p>

<h2 id="xinlenal-from-the-outside-in">Xinlenal From the Outside In</h2>

<p>As we saw before, Xinlenal wasn’t just a Netherese flying city, it was the first
ever built. It fell here in the Wood when Netheril’s magic stopped
working. Today, when viewed from the outside, it looks like an out-of-place
60-foot tall plateau jutting up from the ground in an otherwise flat area of the
Wood. The structures atop it are hidden from view by the Wood’s vegetation,
which grew over it in the two millennia since the city crashed. The Shadovar led
by Prince Clariburnus use Xinlenal as their main base of operations in the
region, and are hard at work trying to make it fly again.</p>

<h3 id="the-forest-of-hides">The Forest of Hides</h3>

<p>The Gray Wolf recognize this is the center of Netherese power even though they
don’t know what goes on in here. So when they declared war on the Forsworn, they
started hanging up the skins of their “traitorous kinfolk” in a clearing outside
the plateau. This acts as both a warning to enemies and as a show of support for
their new masters.</p>

<p>Ironically, the sheer brutality of this practice has led many rank-and-file Gray
Wolf to question their leadership, and the horrible smell of dead werewolf
lingering about the place acts as a cover for Forsworn spies and makes it easier
for them to scout the plateau.</p>

<p>The act of building the Forest of Hides outraged and horrified many of the
primal spirits who used to be friends of the Grey Wolf. If the Pack Outcast,
Uthgardt Barbarian, or any other PC who uses primal powers dismantle the Forest
of Hides, those spirits will reward them with a daily power named <strong>Wrath of the
Fallen</strong>, which can be activated after an attack hits and makes the target
vulnerable 5 to all damage (save ends), including that of the triggering
attack. Once the target saves, they take another 10 damage.</p>

<p>Here you see the first instance of what I talked about in the intro paragraphs
above. There’s more below.</p>

<h3 id="the-city-and-the-web-of-stone">The City and the Web of Stone</h3>

<p>The walls of the plateau are a sheer climb, but they look natural after two
millennia of weathering. Some flying monsters even made lairs there. The city at
the top looks completely ruined when viewed from the plateau’s edge.</p>

<p>Those moving towards the center will soon spot a massive suspended “web” made of
stone looming over the skyline. This acts as a gigantic crane and construction
tool used in the Shadovar’s renovation efforts. It can lift whole city blocks
for relocation, or remove an equivalent quantity of soil and vegetation to
reveal the structures buried beneath. Workers both organic and artificial are
constantly swarming all over it.</p>

<p>This web was built by the shadar-kai witch Korvina, who realized she could use
residual energy from the city’s old protection rituals to power it. Later she
would find out she was actually drawing power from the city’s broken mythallar
and delaying its repairs. When her bosses found out about the oopsie, she
managed to pin the blame for it on her colleague Qualthus, whose fate we’ll
learn in a future post.</p>

<h3 id="the-womb-of-stone">The Womb of Stone</h3>

<p>Gee, these Netherese sure have a knack for naming things, don’t they?</p>

<p>This building is an ancient construct factory reactivated by the Shadovar. This
is where they build all the thaalud constructs they’re using as a workforce. The
ones they build today aren’t as powerful as the ones from ancient Netheril
(using the thaalud constructor stat block from earlier in this book), but they
can do their job just fine.</p>

<p>The Womb of Stone is run and operated by a shade named Ulrukan (stats as a human
slaver with shade traits). His left arm and leg are animated prosthetic
constructs, which I think is awesome. Ulrukan discovered the problem with the
Web of Stone before anyone else, decided to keep it to himself until he could
gain something by revealing it, and lost the chance to do so when other people
found the issue and reported it immediately. Now that it’s public he’s trying to
figure out how to extract some advantage from the fact that he knew it before
anyone else did. I don’t think he knows it’s Korvina’s fault, or he’d already be
blackmailing her.</p>

<h3 id="cathedral-of-night">Cathedral of Night</h3>

<p>This is a ancient building repurposed as a temple to the goddess Shar. The
exterior is still ruined and worn, but the interior is very fancy and all done
up in onyx and jet. It’s also protected by enchanted hungry shadows, a very
interesting hazard that can temporarily remove PCs from play and cause ongoing
psychic and necrotic damage to them while they’re gone. This security protects
the usual temple treasures and also a portal to the Shadowfell, which is used by
the Shadovar to access their supply routes.</p>

<p>Orthinos Eln is the priest in charge of both the temple and the restoration
project. He can be found here either meditating or communing with his boss
Prince Clariburnus, who leads the faction as a whole.</p>

<h3 id="xinlenals-heart">Xinlenal’s Heart</h3>

<p>The city’s <em>mythallar</em> is located at its very center. The tower that houses it
was the first building to be completely restored, and a small army of Shadovar
artificers is now busy restoring the artifact itself.</p>

<p>The restoration process is simple to describe but very hard to execute. It
consists of mixing melted glass with large quantities of residuum, carefully
pouring the resulting substance over the <em>mythallar</em>, and molding it so that it
slowly recovers its original spherical shape. Right now it looks like a partial
sphere, already over 100 feet (30 meters!) in diameter.</p>

<p>This is why the Netherese are scouring the region’s many ruins and dungeons for
magic items and other ancient enchanted relics, and also why they’re poised to
begin raiding Neverwinter. All of that loot is going to get destroyed for its
residuum. The Shadovar are burning the legacies of others to rebuild their own.</p>

<p>The central tower is also where their main war room is located, as well as
Clariburnus’ quarters and throne room. He can either be found here coordinating
the faction’s overall strategy, or somewhere out in the world leading another
raid for magic items. He also sometimes brings members of the Gray Wolf
leadership here for briefings.</p>

<h2 id="vellosk">Vellosk</h2>

<p>This is the main “settlement” of the Gray Wolf tribe, located in the Wood away
from Xinlenal. The quotes are there because they are mostly nomadic, and this is
just where a few more permanent structures are built - pack leader’s homes, a
feast hall, and some other communal buildings. You can also find a number of
tents and lean-tos scattered around the area, belonging to other tribe members
who are currently staying there.</p>

<p>The book says the Grey Wolf have the technology to make weapons and tools as
sophisticated as that of Neverwinter, but that they have no real culture to
speak of beyond an obsession with behaving like D&amp;D’s idea of a wolf pack. It
could be that this is what the current leadership thinks, but the way the book
phrases it kinda makes me think this is what they were like even before.</p>

<p>Vellosk’s central feature is a sloped pit whose bottom is coated in dry bones,
and also contains a totem pole decorated with animal skulls. This is their
center of worship, dedicated to Uthgar and the tribe’s guardian spirits. It’s
also where ritual combats and duels happen.</p>

<p>One of the permanent structures here is the home of Ormshas, a dark creeper
necromancer who is here officially as a Netherese ambassador and in reality as a
spy placed to make sure the Grey World remain under control. She has a large
group of wraiths under her control, which she uses to uncover secrets and
silence dissenters.</p>

<h3 id="the-gray-wolf-and-the-pcs">The Gray Wolf and the PCs</h3>

<p>A lot of the rank-and-file Grey Wolf are very unhappy with the direction the
tribe is taking, but they also believe their leaders’ commands are absolute and
those leaders have been completely bought the Netherese party line. Many tribe
members would rather leave than try to challenge their leaders, but these days
those who express a desire to leave are executed on the spot.</p>

<p>PCs such as the Pack Outcast or the Uthgardt Barbarian would have an easier time
convincing the Grey Wolf to reject their leadership, but they would still need
to challenge those leaders to ritual combat and win (or convince/help a friendly
Gray Wolf to do so). Ritual combat is, of course, to the death.</p>

<p>Making a legitimate challenge would also require convincing a majority of the
tribe that their leaders are being bamboozled by the Netherese. Just going for
the leaders at once is a sure way to get the whole tribe to declare war on you
no matter what they think about those leaders, so it’s not a good option for
most groups.</p>

<h2 id="conyberry">Conyberry</h2>

<p>Conyberry is a small village at the edge of the Wood that became quite scenic
during the Spellplague when a populated slice of Abeir was isekaied there. It
gained a new lake, a bunch of floating earthmotes, and a mixed population that
learned to live well together after some initial friction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately you don’t get to see that version of it, because the Grey Wolf
killed everyone long before the Netherese even got to them. According to the
book they believed the people from Abeir to be hostile invaders and the people
of Conyberry to be their co-conspirators.</p>

<p>The Gray Wolf used the now empty village as a storage area for a time. No one
else went there because everyone (rightly) assumed it had been destroyed after
news stopped coming, and when someone did stumble into the place they were
killed.</p>

<p>When the Netherese recruited them they started using the village to, in the
words of the book, “practice civilized behavior” so that they would blend into
the communities they were ordered to infiltrate. Now when outsiders end up there
by accident they’re received by a bunch of Gray Wolf in sheep’s clothing eager
to test their acting skills. Only after the actors are satisfied, or when
they’re found out, do the murder attempts start.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Xinlenal itself seems like a good dungeon location. A final battle against
Caliburnus in the <em>mythallar</em> chamber would look awesome.</p>

<p>But everything about the description of the Gray Wolf kinda ruins it. The text
is filled with the exact set of racist tropes that draw so much criticism to
D&amp;D. I’m left with the distinct impression that the Gray Wolf are described as
being bad <em>because they’re tribal</em>, in contrast to the “civilized” people they
disdain and victimize. Yikes!</p>

<p>That’s definitely something I’d completely rewrite if I ever ran a campaign in
this setting. It actually kinda tainted the good memories I had of this book,
and made me stop writing new Let’s Read material for it for a while.</p>
