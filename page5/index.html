            <p>Here begins Chapter 4, the Gazeteer. This takes up the remaining half of the
book and focuses on describing interesting places in the region and their
associated plot hooks. It also talks about interesting NPCs that might get
involved with the group. These locations and people aren’t fully mapped or
statted out, but are intended to serve as starting points for individual GMs to
customize. As promised in the book’s preface, a lot of plot hooks here are
optional and/or multiple-choice, and GMs are free to change anything in here
however they want.</p>

<p>The chapter covers several major areas, and we might need more than one post for
each of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ruined Neverwinter</strong> is the city proper, struggling to rebuild and deal with
political intrigue, dangerous ruins, and plaguechanged monsters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Helm’s Hold</strong> is a stout-hearted village with a monastic community that
hides a terrible threat to the region.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Neverwinter Wood</strong>: You wouldn’t believe how many dangerous places and
threatening factions can fit into this one forest!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Gauntlgrym</strong>: the hidden dwarven city no longer has any dwarves in it, but
it has pretty much everything else including that slumbering primordial.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Evernight</strong> is Neverwinter’s reflection on the Shadowfell and the main
battleground in the war between Thayans and Netherese.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Thay Through the Veil</strong>: PCs who follow the plot threads from Evernight all
the way to their end might find themselves needing to make some visits to Nazi
Necromancer Central.</p>
  </li>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The encounter table for the Netherese is packed with shadow-themed
opponents. There are a few humans here and there, but also a lot of shadar-kai,
and Dark Ones, and a few new options to turn any of these into Shades. Since
they’re a magic-heavy faction the table also includes a few constructs and bound
incorporeal undead.</p>

<h2 id="shades">Shades</h2>

<p>Shades are creatures that absorbed so much of the Shadowfell’s ambient magic
that they mutated. They can also be born from otherwise “mundane” creatures who
absorbed that energy. As you might expect a lot of the Shadovar fit this
description.</p>

<p>There are two ways to turn a monster stat block into a Shade. The Forgotten
Realms’ campaign setting has a monster template that turns a regular monster
into an elite shade. And this book presents a theme that adds appropriate powers
to an existing creature without upgrading its “quality”.</p>

<p>The theme changes the base creature’s origin to Shadow, adds Darkvision and
Vulnerable 5 radiant and also these three abilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Regeneration</strong> 5, which shuts down for a turn when the creature takes
radiant damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Coalescing Darkness</strong>, a trait that gives the shade total concealment for a
turn whenever it moves 3 or more squares by any means.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shadow Stride</strong>, an encounter power that takes a move action and lets the
shade teleport up to <em>20</em> squares, but requires that the destination space be
in dim light or darkness.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thaalud-constructor">Thaalud Constructor</h2>

<p>One of the most fearsome security measures in Netherese tombs and ruins are the
constructs known as Thaalud Tomb Trappers. The Constructor is a modern design
based on those, weaker but easier to make.</p>

<p>That’s all the lore we get for this monsters. Since I don’t know anything about
tomb trappers I’m forced to speculate based on their stats. I’m thinking they’re
huge eyeless humanoid statues, and quite a bit smarter than your typical
mindless construct.</p>

<p>A constructor is a Huge Natural Animate with the Blind and Construct keywords,
and a Level 5 Elite Brute with 154 HP. It’s immune to poison, blindness, and
gaze attacks, and has Resist 5 to cold, fire, and lightning. It perceives the
world with Blindsight 20.</p>

<p>It attacks with <strong>Mauling Fists</strong> that damage and grab on a hit (escape DC 15),
and can make <strong>double attacks</strong> with them. If the constructor has a Large or
smaller creature grabbed, it can throw it at someone else with <strong>Hurl Foe</strong>, a
ranged attack that damages both the target and the “ammunition”. On a hit, the
target is pushed 1 square and knocked prone, and the hurled PC falls prone on
the target’s former space. On a miss both take half damage and the thrown
character falls prone adjacent to the target. I gotta say “grab and yeet” sounds
like a very fun combat style.</p>

<p>When a constructor is destroyed it <strong>Collapses into rubble</strong>, attacking a Close
Burst 1 around itself and turning that area into a zone of difficult terrain
that lasts until the end of the encounter. Note that the creature is Huge, so
this zone is 4 squares on a side.</p>

<h2 id="clariburnus-tanthul-prince-of-shade">Clariburnus Tanthul, Prince of Shade</h2>

<p>The Shadovar are ruled by the Twelve Princes of Shade, Netherese mages who were
witnesses to the fall of their empire and managed to stay alive(-ish) to the
present day. Clariburnus Tanthul is one of these Twelve.</p>

<p>Contrary to all expectations, he’s not undead! Tanthul is an ancient living
shade, and is described as retaining more of his original humanity than the
other Princes. Still, he’s a merciless manipulator with no concept of honor,
breaking his promises as casually as he breathes.</p>

<p>Clariburnus Tanthul is a Medium Shadow Humanoid and a Level 10 Elite Skirmisher
with 158 HP. He has a Speed of 7 and both Blindsight 10 and Darkvision. His
traits resemble those of the Shade theme above but they’re custom and more
powerful.</p>

<p>His <strong>Benighted Presence</strong> acts as an aura (5) that turns bright light dim, and
his <strong>Regeneration</strong> heals 15 HP per turn, though it’s still shut down for a
turn by radiant damage.</p>

<p>He wields a scimitar named <strong>Gloom Crescent</strong>, which can make basic attacks and
is also used for the <strong>Severing Shadows</strong> technique. This lets him make 2 basic
attacks (3 if bloodied), teleporting 5 squares before each one. If he hits the
same target twice that target also takes 5 ongoing force damage (save
ends). This worsens to 10 ongoing force damage and blindness after the first
failed save (save ends both).</p>

<p>Once per encounter he can use a ranged spell named <strong>By Night Consumed</strong>, which
deals necrotic damage and <em>removes the target from play</em> (save ends). A miss
deals half damage and dazes (save ends). Nasty!</p>

<p>His <strong>Shadow Stride</strong> lets him teleport 5 squares regardless of light
conditions, which increases to 10 if the destination is in darkness. It’s also a
(Recharge 4+) ability instead of an encounter power, so he can use it more than
once in a fight.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>This has less custom stat blocks than some of the other factions, so you’ll be
mostly relying on the encounter table and shade versions of natural
critters. Still, the custom stat blocks we do get are fun, and it looks like
Clariburnus is a genuine Forgotten Realms big shot who would probably get an
epic-level stat block in a more traditional FR setting book. I love it that he’s
“within reach” of a heroic-tier party here. His stats make for a very
interesting fight, though you should also give him an honor guard.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As mentioned several times in this Let’s Read already, Netheril was a human
empire who ruled over most of the world around three thousand years before our
narrative present.</p>

<p>Their understanding of magic reached levels never seen before or since, but they
fell literally overnight when one of their top archmages tried to cast a spell
that was supposed to make him into a god but instead irreversibly fucked up
Toril’s magic. This caused the vast majority of the flying islands where these
archmages lived to plummet to the ground.</p>

<p>One such island managed to avoid this fate when its inhabitants plane-shifted it
into the Shadowfell (known as the Plane of Shadow back then). They stayed there
until the end of Second Edition, when they started coming back into the world,
mutated by their millenia in darkness and with a desire to rebuild their former
empire.</p>

<p>These shadow-people are known as Shadovar, but they also consider themselves to
be Netherese and the book uses the two terms interchangeably. There’s a group of
them hiding in the Neverwinter Wood, led by a mage named Clariburnus Tanthul.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>The Shadovar have a single major goal in this region: to repair the fallen
island of Xinlenal.</p>

<p>Xinlenal was the first Netherese flying island ever built, the crowning
achievement of the ancient archmage Iolaum, who discovered the technique to
making them. Making it fly again would raise the flag of Netherese dominance
over the whole region, and it would become their greatest center of power in the
entire world.</p>

<p>The key to fixing Xinlenal is to repair its <em>mythallar</em>, a magical engine that
looks like a giant crystal sphere and shines like a contained sun. It shattered
when the city fell, and Shadovar artificers are hard at work repairing it as the
campaign starts. The process requires immense quantities of Residuum, and the
easiest way to produce Residuum is to destroy magic items. The older and more
powerful, the better.</p>

<p>This means Shadovar agents are scouring the entire region looking for ancient
ruins and the magical relics they contain. The ruined cities of Illefarn, the
crumbling outposts of Delzoun, even the burial mounds of Uthgardt heroes: all of
these are fair game, and anyone who would object to their plundering is an
enemy.</p>

<p>Not even these ancient ruins might yield enough residuum for their purposes,
though. They’ve started looking at less-old places too. As the campaign starts
that’s still mostly consists of clashing with and looting the bodies of Thayan
and Ashmadai goons, but they could soon move up to plundering Neverwinter
itself.</p>

<p>One of Caliburnus’ secondary goals include discovering the fate of Iolaum. Sure,
the wizard lived thousands of years ago and was on Xinlenal when it fell, but
surely one of the bestest mages from the bestest magical empire ever wouldn’t
let little details like that kill him, would it? Imagine what he could do for
the Shadovar cause if he’s brought on-board!</p>

<p>The other secondary goal is to pursue their war with Thay. There’s only room for
<em>one</em> world-spanning fascist mage empire in this planet, after all. The Shadovar
regularly attack the Thayan base in the Dread Ring, and they’ve also managed to
park one of their flying fortresses above the Thayan city of Surcross, which
they bombard regularly. In case you don’t remember, that’s one of the possible
locations where Valindra might have hidden her soul vessel.</p>

<p>And finally, further down the list, there’s the handling of the Gray Wolf
Uthgardt tribe. The Shadovar recruited them into their service with appeals to
their “ancient Netherese heritage” and gave them the mission to infiltrate and
eventually conquer Helm’s Hold. So far the werewolves have managed to place
several agents in the town, who are busy sowing unrest and generally making it
ready for a takeover. Their progress is slow but in Caliburnus’ view the tribe’s
main purpose is to act as a red herring when people start trying to investigate
Netherese activities. In the meantime, Gray Wolf warriors also get used as
muscle when the need for it arises.</p>

<h2 id="player-tie-ins">Player Tie-Ins</h2>

<p>The Netherese seems to be the major faction with the most explicit tie-ins to PC
backgrounds.</p>

<p>The Scion of Shadow, of course, starts the game in direct conflict with
them. They have enough information to begin opposing the faction right away, and
especially bold Scions might think to pretend to be loyal in order to infiltrate
it.</p>

<p>Their rampant plundering of ancient ruins also places them in direct opposition
to the Iliyanbruen Guardian, Heir of Delzoun, and the Uthgardt Barbarian. The
book says they are definitely guilty of stealing those eladrin relics, but it’s
less definitive about their role in plundering the Uthgardt barrow - that could
have been the Thayans depending on what the GM desires. Even so, their control
of the Gray Wolves will still make them cross paths with both the Barbarian and
the Pack Outcast.</p>

<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>

<p>The Netherese don’t care about <strong>New Neverwinter</strong> at all, though that will
change a bit when they start targeting the city for its magic items.</p>

<p>They are completely ignorant of the <strong>Abolethic Sovereignity</strong>. Some of their
officials suspect there’s something funky going on beneath Neverwinter and have
sent agents to investigate, but they’re only going to bother Caliburnus about
this when those agents return with answers. This makes the fact that they’re
trying to conquer Helm’s Hold particularly funny.</p>

<p>They see the <strong>Ashmadai</strong> as nothing more than minions of the Thayans and have
no idea the cult has plans of its own. The <strong>Thayans</strong> of course are their
greatest enemies in the region and the Shadovar devote as many resources to
fighting them as they do to restoring Xinlenal.</p>

<p>They also have some important links to minor factions, as mentioned above. Their
hold over the Gray Wolves means they will have to deal with the other <strong>Uthgardt
Tribes</strong> eventually, and the <strong>fey of Iliyanbruen</strong> are the primary targets of
their relic raids.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>While the Netherese are a bit less cognizant of the other factions than I
expected, their plans are appropriately ambitious and they have a real shot at
success barring PC intervention. They also have a bunch of strong ties to
several PC themes, so they’re very likely to feature in your campaign.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>My recent adaptation efforts for that Hell’s Rebels campaign had me going on a
spelunking expedition about fiend stats in D&amp;D. Here’s what I found out, and
what I intend to do about it on this GURPS adaptation.</p>

<p>For our purposes here, “fiend” refers to all of the monsters that originate from
the “evil planes” of the D&amp;D universe: demons, devils, daemons, and
others. “Fiend” was the only general term left, so we’re using it in this post.</p>

<h2 id="fiends-in-dd">Fiends in D&amp;D</h2>

<p>D&amp;D’s fiend situation is one of the most egregious examples of its tendency
towards overly-complicated taxonomies<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Every synonym becomes the name of a
distinct type of monster with stats that differ from those of the rest.</p>

<p>The real purpose of the divide here seems to be mechanical: in most editions
each type has a different lengthy list of weaknesses and resistances that seems
calculated to confuse players. Things that are good against devils are bad
against demons and vice-versa - if the PCs guess wrong, they’re in trouble. The
specifics here change from edition to edition.</p>

<p>Lore-wise, early editions made a big deal out of the fact that devils were
Lawful Evil and demons Chaotic Evil. Later ones tried to elaborate on it and
find more ways to explain that the two alignments were different at a
fundamental cosmic level. Pathfinder really doubles down on that, trying to find
additional themes for every fiend type it presents.</p>

<p>Pathfinder 1e, which is what we’re interested in, has this configuration for the
mechanical bits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Demons are immune to lightning; Devils take normal damage from it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Devils are immune to fire; Most demons are merely resistant to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They’re equally resistant to acid and cold.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They’re both immune to poison.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They’re resistant to weapon attacks unless the weapon is Good-aligned <em>or</em>
made from a special material. For demons, that’s cold iron; for devils,
silver. Powerful specimens have resistance that can only be bypassed by
weapons fulfilling both the alignment and material requirements.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is about as complex to describe as it was in previous editions, but it’s
actually much easier to completely bypass due to the combinatorial explosion in
spells and magical effects available to players compared to AD&amp;D.</p>

<p>After the first couple of levels you can forget about the materials requirement
entirely, because you’ll have access to Align Weapon or the Holy enchantment. By
the time you’re fighting those stronger fiends, you’ll probably have a +3 weapon
in hand, which also bypasses both material requirements. And as for elemental
damage types, this is the edition that introduces sonic damage, which damages
both demons and devils normally. It also makes it quite easy for a character to
swap all of their spells’ damage to sonic<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="fiends-in-dungeon-fantasy">Fiends In Dungeon Fantasy</h2>

<p>Dungeon Fantasy is a lot simpler. Demon is one of the big monster categories in
the game, and all demons come from the area colloquially known as Hell. The
specifics are left as an exercise to the GM.</p>

<p>Belonging to the Demon category makes them immune to magic that affects the
minds of natural creatures and susceptible to magic that affects spirits in
general or demons in particular. They don’t count as “alive” for spells that
strictly require living targets but always count as “evil” for spells and
abilities that affect evil creatures.</p>

<p>Most notably, they do not have any universal resistances to elemental damage or
mundane weapons. Each demon “species”, other than the very weakest ones, does
have additional defenses. Most take damage as normal but can only <em>die</em> if a
specific condition is met. They also often lack some or all of the weak points
of natural creatures, such as blood and vital organs.</p>

<p>Gaming Ballistic’s <em>Nordlond Bestiary</em> does include some demons that are direct
adaptations of D&amp;D fiends, but only the most powerful of them (the Balor and Pit
Fiend equivalents) have resistances that resemble Pathfinder’s to any degree.</p>

<h2 id="what-will-i-do-in-hells-rebels">What Will I Do in Hell’s Rebels?</h2>

<p>If I was starting this project way back in 2017, I’d probably be gearing up to
convert every devil that appeared in Hell’s Rebels to GURPS. But since this is
2023, I don’t have to!</p>

<p>I have <em>plenty</em> of first- and third-party Dungeon Fantasy books now, and between
them I have more than enough stat blocks available that I can just pick whatever
looks closer to the original monster and use that.</p>

<p>This does mean that I’m going to end up ignoring a lot of the default D&amp;D
cosmology and lore when picking my monsters. “Demon” and “devil” are once again
synonyms - there is no fundamental cosmic difference between them. They all come
from the same place. Any differences, if they ever become relevant, are
political rather than taxonomical.</p>

<p>We’re also ignoring the difference between Lawful Evil and Chaotic Evil because
1) there is no alignment in GURPS DF and 2) it’s a bit nonsensical anyway. In
fact, <em>Pathfinder itself</em> is going to get rid of alignment in its upcoming
revised second edition, which was motivated by an attempt to rid itself of all
remaining ties to the OGL after this January’s brouhaha.</p>

<p>The game’s existing rules should suffice to determine whether something counts
as “holy”/”good” or “unholy”/”evil” for game purposes. This is a similar
approach to what I hear PF 2.5 is going to take.</p>

            <p>The encounter table includes a <em>lot</em> of undead, and some spellcasters like the
Human Transmuter from the MV to act as living Red Wizards. Valindra’s special
projects also get some consideration here, and then we move on to the lich
herself.</p>

<h2 id="the-neverwinter-nine">The Neverwinter Nine</h2>

<p>These were the renowned bodyguards of Lord Nasher Alagondar a century ago. After
their deaths, they were buried in the castle crypts in honor of their exemplary
service. Should Valindra manage to animate them as undead, they’d have the stats
of a Deathlock Wight from the MV or the stats for a Unhallowed Wight presented
in this book (level 7 soldier, 80 hp, claws that immobilize and drain healing
surges, auto-damage as an opportunity action on enemies who pass a saving
throw). You can also use similar undead monstrosities if you want to.</p>

<p>Members of the Neverwinter Nine get two extra powers in addition to whatever
their base stat block gives them. <strong>One in Nine</strong> is an encounter power that
lets the creature teleport and swap places with another of the Nine that’s
within 20 squares. And <strong>Change Shape</strong> lets them take the form of a Medium
humanoid they killed during the last encounter, lasting until they use the power
again or cancel the transformation.</p>

<p>That last one means the Nine can serve story roles as infiltrators. One might
even manage to replace Lord Neverember or another big shot.</p>

<h2 id="ash-zombie">Ash Zombie</h2>

<p>These are zombies produced by the particular conditions of the eruption disaster
area. They leave a trail of ash in their wake and are drawn to “fresh” life, the
younger the better.</p>

<p>Any corporeal undead can be converted into the “Ash” equivalent with the
addition of the <strong>Puff of Ash</strong> encounter power. When the creature is first
bloodied, this triggers and enemy Fortitude in a Close Burst 2. A hit makes the
target grant combat advantage and prevents them from spending healing surges
(save ends both).</p>

<h2 id="lorragauth">Lorragauth</h2>

<p>Lorragauth was a particularly despicable elder black dragon who died in the
process of destroying his own domain, which he started doing because he realized
he was dying. If he couldn’t have it, then no one else could!</p>

<p>If Valindra succeeds at reanimating him, he’s going to use the stats for a
dracolich from the Monster Vault or the Forgotten Realms Campaign
Setting. Either is going to make him a Level 12 Solo Controller and one the most
powerful monsters in the entire campaign.</p>

<h2 id="valinda-shadowmantle">Valinda Shadowmantle</h2>

<p>Valindra is much like a typical lich in that she’s extremely arrogant,
egotistical and ambitious. She serves Tam because it suits her for now and is a
very competent lieutenant, but her arrogance makes her prone to underestimating
her opposition.</p>

<p>She has complete confidence that her soul vessel is securely hidden and will
never be found by any of her enemies, so she doesn’t fear destruction and fights
with seemingly suicidal zeal to protect her plans.</p>

<p>How right she is depends on how the GM wishes to play her. If they want the PCs
to defeat her after a single climatic battle, the vessel is right there in her
inner sanctum at the Dread Ring. If they want to make her a recurring threat,
it’s hidden in the far away Thayan city of Scorrus (which is covered later in
the book).</p>

<p>Velindra’s stats shows us she was an eladrin in life, probably a sun elf. She’s
a Level 9 Elite Controller with 188 HP. She has a ground speed of 6, a flight
speed of 4, and darkvision.</p>

<p>Her basic melee attack is a <strong>Vampiric Touch</strong> that deals necrotic damage and
heals Valindra for the same amount. This will be quite annoying to PCs and
greatly increase her staying power. Her basic ranged attack is a <strong>Phantom
Claw</strong> that targets one or two creatures, deals necrotic and psychic damage, and
immobilizes (save ends). Each failed saving throw lets her slide the target 2
squares. On a miss, the target is still slowed (save ends).</p>

<p>She has a <strong>Profane Fire</strong> attack that’s pretty much a fireball that does
necrotic and fire damage, and recharges when she’s bloodied. And she retains the
<strong>Fey Step</strong> she had in life.</p>

<p>As minor actions, she can use one of two encounter powers. <strong>Shadow Cloak</strong>
gives her insubstantial and phasing but prevents her from taking standard
actions until she ends the whole effect as a free action. And <strong>Reanimate</strong> lets
her bring a dead non-minion ally back into the fight as an undead creature. The
creature comes back with HP equal half its bloodied value and gains Resist
Necrotic 10 and Vulnerable Radiant 5. The target must have been a living
creature before dying - if it was undead already, this doesn’t work.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Which of these is the Thayan’s most fearsome weapon depends on how you want to
play them. If they’re an insidious and secretive threat in your campaign, then
you’ll get a lot of mileage out of the Neverwinter Nine and their ability to
replace key people in other organizations. If they’re a more direct and forceful
enemy, facing Lorragauth is a distinct possibility in the PCs’ futures.</p>

<p>Either way, Valindra herself is a key player and should likely be there for the
final fight. PCs might end up facing her a few times before then, depending on
how secure you want her soul vessel to be. Finding it could be a neat series of
adventures in itself.</p>
