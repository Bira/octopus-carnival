</figure>

<p>This is the start of a series! Go to the <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/">project page</a> to see all entries.</p>

<p>It’s been quite a while since I posted an article on this series! There are
several reasons for this, both real-world and blog-related. One of the latter
ones was that these adventures were getting <em>bigger</em>. The detailed approach I
took on Adventure 02 was meant to kinda be a stealth GURPS adaptation, but it
probably wasn’t as helpful as I thought and it left me kinda burned out on
Hell’s Rebels.</p>

<p>I’m going to take a more condensed approach on Adventure 03, <strong>Dance of the
Damned</strong>, and leave the detailed conversion bits for their own post. This one
feels even bigger than Adventure 02, as it has three “dungeons” and a number of
social encounters as well. I’ll try to cover them all with one post.</p>

<p>One of the things that happened over the hiatus is that I ran the first
adventure and most of the second for a group of my friends, over roll20 and
using GURPS. So you can expect <em>real</em> conversion notes in the future!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>By the end of the previous adventure, the PCs had secured a permanent
headquarters under the ruins of the Lucky Bones casino and completed several
high profile missions that increased their fame and notoriety within the city of
Kintargo. Even Barzilai Thrune, ruler of Kintargo and the campaign’s Big Bad,
was forced to congratulate them on their “civic-mindedness” after they get rid
of a dangerous serial killer.</p>

<p>Thrune unwittingly helps them further by increasing the Bleakbridge toll to 2gp
per crossing (or 10 for a day pass). This a trivial amount for the PCs by this
point, but it’s prohibitive for a lot of the civilian population. You see,
Kintargo is split into northern and southern halves by a river, and this bridge
is the only crossing. Plus D&amp;D sets the daily wage of a common laborer at about
1gp. So yeah, dick move on Barzilai’s part.</p>

<p>Some people set up illegal ferry operations in response to this, at first
charging just a few coppers and then doing it for free just to stick it to the
Man. It’s quite possible the Silver Raven PCs themselves have already done this
after the first couple of increases in previous adventures (like my group
did). If they did that, they’re sure to gain a massive reputation boost. Even if
they didn’t anti-Thrune sentiment should still help them gather supporters.</p>

<p>With the rebellion poised to grow so much, it’s time to begin thinking bigger,
and this is what Adventure 03 is about.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, the book also mentions that the PCs might want to begin thinking about
improving the Lucky Bones’ defenses. It doesn’t get attacked during <em>this</em>
adventure, but there’s a high chance that will happen in the future.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1-the-silver-council">Chapter 1: The Silver Council</h2>

<p>If the PCs aren’t yet regularly meeting with the key NPC allies they’ve been
making along the way, then one of these allies will suggest they begin doing so
now. The book calls this group the Silver Council. It will at the very least be
composed of Laria Longroad and Rexus from Adventure 01 plus Hetamon Haace from
Adventure 02, and will also contain any other such allies the group makes in
your game.</p>

<p>The Silver Council’s first order of business in this adventure is an alliance
proposal by Lady Mialari Docur, one of Haace’s good friends. She runs Lady
Docur’s School for Girls, which is a real school but also a front for the
closest thing Kintargo has to a functioning thieves’ guild. The offer is
genuine, the numeric and political benefits are great, and the alliance is more
or less automatic unless the PCs go out of their way to be assholes.</p>

<p>After these pleasantries are concluded it’s time to discuss the next big
steps in the rebellion’s progression. They have plenty of citizen support, but
they should still secure official alliances with Kintargo’s noble houses. And
even beyond that, they should gather <em>regional</em> support and prevent Thrune from
doing the same. Kintargo is not the only city in the duchy of Ravounel, after
all.</p>

<h3 id="noble-alliances">Noble Alliances</h3>

<p>Kintargo’s eight remaining noble houses are a bit more similar to Renaissance
families than to feudal ones. Their fortunes come from varied commercial
interests in the duchy. We get a list of houses, a short stat line for their
leaders, their political allegiance, the requirement for an alliance, and its
mechanical benefits to the rebellion.</p>

<p>Political allegiance can be either to Kintargo or to Thrune. Houses whose
allegiance lies with Kintargo can be persuaded to support the rebellion if the
PCs can impress their leaders and convince them the city would be better off if
it declares independence from Cheliax. Failure to do so results in them staying
neutral. Thrune-aligned houses can’t be convinced to ally with the
Ravens. They’re also a bunch of evil slave traders, so we don’t want then on
our side anyway.</p>

<p>Four of the houses are Kintargo-aligned, three are Thrune-aligned, and one is
undecided. This last one is House Aulorian, which will only ally with the Ravens
if the PCs undo their good deed from Adventure 02 and return Marquel to them. I
don’t imagine many groups will go for this, but the option is there. Unless this
happens, they flip to Thrune when the chips are down.</p>

<h3 id="regional-hot-spots">Regional Hot Spots</h3>

<p>Kintargo is the capital of the duchy of Ravounel, but it’s not its only
city. The duchy is cut off from central Cheliax by an imposing mountain chain
with a single pass through it. Most trade comes via sea.</p>

<p>There are three important places related to the goal of gathering regional
support in Ravounel:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The aquatic elf village of Acisazi, whose inhabitants can do a lot to defend
Kintargo from Chelish naval actions. The PCs rescued scouts from this
community in the previous adventure, which should give them an “in” with the
local rulers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The city of Vyre, a mostly independent “vice city” that’s a preferred vacation
spot for the country’s nobility. The Chelish government wants to keep good
relations to them because it loves its vacations; they want to keep good
relations to Kintargo because they don’t have a decent sea port. Securing an
alliance with Vyre would help with keeping Cheliax away.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Menador Gap, that one mountain pass to Central Cheliax.  If the pass is
closed, it will prevent Chelish troops from marching directly into the
province. They’d have to take the long way around and march through
neighboring nations, which will be at the very least much harder.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these is its own chapter (or “Part”) in the book.</p>

<h3 id="rumors">Rumors</h3>

<p>We close with a round of rumors where the GM can insert the ones they like. The
book notes two important ones: a reminder that the former Mayor of Kintargo is
still missing, and the news that Barzilai Thrune is organizing a grand gala to
assure the city everything is fine.</p>

<p>The gala, named the Ruby Masquerade, will be the adventure’s climax.</p>

<h3 id="notes-and-impressions">Notes and Impressions</h3>

<p>I think this is where the Adventure Path format hurt the actual adventure a
bit. Both Lady Docur and the noble houses feel like things that could have been
introduced way back in Aventure 01.</p>

<p>An early introduction to Lady Docur give the PCs a good starting bonus on the
“strategic layer” of the campaign, and allows her to act as the “face” of
Kintargo’s black market when the PCs need to buy gear. I did that when I GMed
Adventure 01 and had a lot of fun inserting Little Witch Academia characters as
students / guild members.</p>

<p>The noble houses also benefit from an early introduction. Securing alliances
with them requires a lot of personal interactions with their leaders, so PCs who
like the tradecraft and roleplaying aspects could have a good time researching
their habits, arranging meetings, and negotiating with them. It also gives a
little more weight to the decision of whether to rescue Marquel in the first
place or not. Rescuing him still the right thing to do, IMHO, but it feels more
organic to have it be inserted in a political context from the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2-dead-in-the-deep">Chapter 2: Dead In the Deep</h2>

<p>Ravounel has a northern coast that’s mostly dominated by a huge tangle of reefs
known as the Dismal Nitch. There are charted routes through this, but Kintargo
is pretty much the only decent sea port in the region. The Acisazi village is
located in the Nitch, and its sea elf inhabitants can easily swim all through
it. They can do wonders to block those sea routes if they don’t like the people
trying to sail through. The PCs should make sure they dislike Thrune.</p>

<p>If the PCs saved the sea elf scouts from Adventure 02, they’re going to have a
<em>much</em> easier time here.</p>

<h3 id="the-situation">The Situation</h3>

<p>The Acisazi village has a submerged district and a coastal one, where its
half-elf inhabitants live. It’s located near an underwater shaft called The
Drowned Eye, a cursed place whose evil was contained by Acisazi wards. Back
around the start of Adventure 01, though, these wards failed, and a strange
malady began affecting the village’s inhabitants.</p>

<p>Here’s the spoilerific truth: the wards failed because they were destroyed by
Menotheguro, an aboleth necromancer who moved in around the time Adventure 01
was getting started. He’s working on focusing the Drowned Eye’s cursed energy
into the creation of an epic undead creature called a “sea bonze” (i.e, an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umib%C5%8Dzu">Umibozu</a>).</p>

<p>To protect himself, he’s raized an entire sunken ship’s crew as draugr, and a
huge great white shark as a zombie. He also secretly placed Nerrenn, the
village’s main protector, under long-term mental domination.</p>

<p>Menotheguro’s draugr have been raiding the village and taking prisoners below
the waves to serve as sacrifices in his magical workings. The elf scouts came to
Kintargo to ask for Shensen’s help - she was a long-time friend of theirs. With
her missing, though, the PCs are their only hope. If the scouts survive
Adventure 02, their leader Aava can tell the PCs about the malady, the draugr
raids, and that they serve someone named “Menotheguro”. She doesn’t know the
rest.</p>

<h3 id="negotiation">Negotiation</h3>

<p>Getting into the village is going to be hard even if the PCs bring the sea elf
scouts with them. Nerrenn will receive them at the head of a crowd of hesitant
half-elves. Acting as the village’s interim leader, he will deny then entry
citing all sorts of paranoid reasons.</p>

<p>PCs good at Diplomacy or Intimidation might convince him to allow an audience
with the village’s Speaker. Otherwise there’s going to be a fight. Whether he’s
browbeaten or just plain beaten up, Nerrenn will rush to his master’s side after
this encounter. Perceptive PCs might realize he’s dominated, and might think to
restrain him and try to dispel or suppress the effect. If they succeed at it,
Nerrenn will spill the whole truth outlined above.</p>

<p>Next is an audience with the village’s true leader, Speaker Athannah. This aged
half-elf druid is close to death due to the curse. She will be an instant friend
of the PCs if they brought the scouts back or revealed Nerrenn’s
domination. Otherwise winning her over will require some more diplomacy on the
PCs’ part. In either case, her condition for a formal alliance is the same:
break the curse of the Drowned Eye and save the village.</p>

<h3 id="dungeon-the-drowned-eye">Dungeon: The Drowned Eye</h3>

<p>The Drowned Eye is a deep pit in the ocean floor near a particularly treacherous
set of reefs. Its “curse” comes from the fact that a lot of ships sunk and fell
into it over the years, saturating the place with a death aura. Menotheguro is
at the bottom, protected by his guardians.</p>

<p>This is a “dungeon” only in the sense that it’s a location with monsters. The
layout is entirely linear, and the PCs will run through every encounter in the
order listed. The biggest environmental complication is that it’s all
underwater. By this point the PCs should have some experience with underwater
combat, since it was a good bit of Adventure 02’s final dungeon. Acisazi Village
should have more than enough water-breathing magic available even if they didn’t
come prepared for this.</p>

<p>When the PCs approach the vincinity of the hole, they’re going to be attacked by
half of Menotheguro’s draugr contingent. If they haven’t yet dropped underwater,
they’re going to have a surprise because the undead will surely try to sink
their boat and/or drag then under.</p>

<p>Dropping down into the Eye itself, the PCs are going to fight the zombie white
shark on the way down. There is no ground, and their opponent is aquatic, making
this fight extra-tricky even though the shark’s numbers aren’t particularly
scary against the whole party.</p>

<p>The bottom has the other half of the draugr, including their captain, and an
entrance to Menotheguro’s cave.</p>

<p>It’s almost guaranteed that the aboleth will notice the fight just outside his
door. If that happens he’ll try to trick the PCs with an illusion after they
deal with the draugr, claiming to be the ghost of a druid named “Menotha” who
needs a cleansing ritual performed by a living druid so she can finally rest.</p>

<p>If the PCs don’t fall for the illusion, the aboleth fights them immediately. If
they <em>do</em>, he will wait for them to bring Athannah down here, dominate her and
<em>then</em> fight the PCs.</p>

<p>Menotheguro himself only has 3 levels of Necromancer, but those are stacked on
top of an aboleth stat block so he’s certainly boss material. If Nerrenn escaped
the surface he will be here at full health ready to fight alongside his
master. He’s considerably more dangerous here because he has terrain advantage
and has his shark animal companion with him.</p>

<p>After the fight the PCs can destroy the runes etched in the cave’s wall to ruin
Menotheguro’s ritual and cleanse the Eye. Then they can loot the pile of
treasure in the corner.</p>

<p>With the aboleth destroyed and the curse lifted, the PCs secure an alliance from
Acisazi.</p>

<h3 id="notes-and-impressions-1">Notes and Impressions</h3>

<p>This is by far the most “side-trekky” part of the adventure. It does have a
connection to the overall campaign and its story is kinda interesting, which is
good. On the other hand, its ends in an underwater “dungeon” featuring exactly a
day’s worth of combat encounters placed in a straight line one after the
other.</p>

<p>I think this is enough to make skipping this chapter altogether a reasonable
decision. In that case you can say Acisazi is actually fine, that Aava was a
relative of the Speaker, and that rescuing her back in Adventure 02 is enough to
secure the alliance. Escorting her back home is something one of the rebellion’s
NPC teams might do, freeing the PCs up for the other scenes.</p>

<p>Next up: a feast and a fort.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Sit down dear readers, for there’s a lot of lore coming your way. Imix himself
first appeared in the Fiend Folio for AD&amp;D 1e, along with the other Elemental
Princes. His writeup here also melds two classic stories from the 1e era.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>So, as it’s been mentioned a few times before, the god Tharizdun is probably the
biggest asshole in all of 4e’s implied setting. Before even the Dawn War, he
came across a shard of cosmic evil, and decided to use that in a bid to conquer
the universe. He planted this shard in the Elemental Chaos as if it was a seed,
and from this seed sprouted the Abyss. Tharizdun used the Abyss to generate an
innumerable host of demons. Some of these were created through corruption (of
elementals, of his own servants, and others). Others were formed directly from
abyssal energies under Tharizdun’s direction.</p>

<p>A lot of things happened after that but it suffices to say that Tharizdun’s
attempt at conquest ultimately failed and the god was imprisoned by his peers in
the most secure prison they could conceive. His name was erased from all records
of the gods, some say from reality itself. We only know it because we’re the
readers and we’re outside the setting.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to the time of the Dawn War. The gods are slowly winning, for they
are capable of teamwork and their proud enemies are not. Except, that is, for a
group of 5 Primordials who were contacted by a mysterious entity that introduced
itself as the Elder Elemental Eye. The contacted Primordials believed they had
just lucked into a direct line to the <em>first</em> Primordial, and so they readily
accepted its offer of power in exchange for loyalty. They called themselves the
Elemental Princes from that point onward.</p>

<p>The alliance between the Elemental Princes was far from ironclad, but it was
enough to allow them to get through the War with both their lives and their
freedom. They’re still out there, in the Elemental Chaos, plotting to overthrow
the gods and free their master.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: The Elder Elemental Eye is a pseudonym for Tharizdun. Serving and
worshiping the Eye funnels power to the Chained God so that he might one day
break free of his prison.</p>

<p>This entry concerns Imix, the Evil Elemental Prince of Fire. As the name
implies, he represents all the bad things one usually associates with
fire. Uncontrolled passions, rage, indiscriminate destruction. Though he is
technically free, Imix lives in a state of self-imposed house arrest. He has a
stronghold built into the caldera of an active volcano, and he never leaves
it. His attempts to influence the world and advance his plan all go through his
agents and cultists.</p>

<p>Imix’s cult in the middle world is unusually large and active for a
primordial’s. It accepts misanthropes, murderers, and those who are angry at the
world and willing to swear any oath for the power to take revenge. Whatever
their individual reasons might be, they eventually cease to matter, as advancing
in the cult means having pieces of your free will burned away until your only
wish is to do Imix’s bidding and help free the Eye.</p>

<p>They usually hide out among sapient communities and sow division and discord,
encouraging its inhabitants to rebel and fight among themselves. Their temples
tend to be built inside ruins and other scary places. The cultists protect them
vigilantly and burn to death anyone who gets too close.</p>

<p>More important temples are usually dedicated to the Elder Elemental Eye and
protected by two or more Elemental Prince cults, who spend as much time
sabotaging and upstaging one another as they do actually advancing the Eye’s
cause. The cult’s greatest seat of power in the middle world is the legendary
Temple of Elemental Evil, protected and operated by all the Elemental Prince
cults and any mercenaries and servants they manage to recruit.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>This entry concerns Imix himself. We’ll take a look at his cultists in the next
one.</p>

<p>Imix is a Huge Elemental Humanoid with the Fire and Primordial keywords. I think
he’s the first monster to carry that last one, but he won’t be the last. He’s a
Level 32 Solo Controller with 1140 HP. He has darkvision, a ground speed of 10,
and a flight speed of 8 with Hover. He is immune to disease and fire.</p>

<p>The heat from Imix’s <strong>Withering Flames</strong> acts as an aura (5) that <em>strips all
fire resistance</em> from any enemies inside. His basic attack is a Reach 3
<strong>Blazing Blade</strong> that deals immediate and ongoing fire damage, and the
<strong>Blazing Arc</strong> maneuver allows him to attack every enemy in reach with a single
action.</p>

<p>Imix can call up <strong>Servants of Elemental Fire</strong>, summoning four Fire Grues, or
six if he’s bloodied. Fire Grues are minions with the same defenses as
Imix. Grues don’t attack, but any enemy that ends their turn adjacent to one or
more grues takes 15 fire damage. Imix can move all of them up to 6 squares with
a single minor action, and the summoning power recharges if there are no grues
in the field.</p>

<p>He can also use <strong>Volcanic Circle</strong> to detonate a grue, dealing heavy fire
damage in a Close Burst 1 around the minion. This creates a zone that lasts
until the end of the encounter and deals 20 fire damage to enemies that enter it
or end their turns there. Yes, this is at-will. Once the battle against Imix
starts, the entire battlefield will very soon be on fire.</p>

<p><strong>Blinding Flare</strong> is a minor action that attacks all enemies adjacent to grues
in a Close Burst 10, dealing fire damage and blinding (save ends). A miss deals
half damage and imposes a -2 penalty to attack rolls for a turn. This recharges
when Imix is first bloodied.</p>

<p><strong>Hungry Flames</strong> is another minor action that targets every enemy taking ongoing
fire damage within 10 squares. It weakens them (save ends) and deals 10 fire
damage to any creature adjacent to them.</p>

<p>If an enemy tries to move away from a grue, Imix can use <strong>Demand Focus</strong> to
attack their Will and daze them for a turn. If an enemy misses him with a melee
attack, <strong>Formed of Fire</strong> deals 10 damage to that enemy and any ally adjacent
to them. And if Imix is affected by a save-ends effect, <strong>Eternal Resilience</strong>
allows him to roll a save against that effect immediately in addition to the
normal saves everyone gets.</p>

<p>I guess Imix will use grues to surround the party, and the grue-based attacks to
blind the PCs and prevent them from getting away. He will detonate enough grues
to light the battlefield on fire, and will strive to keep the PCs within his
aura as he attacks them with his blazing sword. Once enough PCs are taking
ongoing damage, he will use Hungry Flames and keep attacking.</p>

<p>For extra pain, you can set the battle in a Font of Power aligned to Fire. This
is a special terrain type listed in the DMG that gives damage bonus to attacks
with the appropriate damage type. An epic one gives +15 damage, and it certainly
makes sense for Imix’s own seat of power to qualify as a Font.</p>

<p>Howlers totally feel like a 3e monster, probably because of the art. I suppose
they might have shown up in AD&amp;D too, it’s not like the game was ever shy about
adding one more dog monster to the pile.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Howlers are spiky, sapient quadrupedal predators that feed on fear. They’ve
evolved to hunt in a way that’s as terrifying as possible. Younger howlers are
quick to kill because they enjoy the spike of fear the victim feels when it
dies, but older specimens are sophisticated enough to hold whole villages
hostage with the <em>threat</em> of death-by-howler and feed off the ambient terror.</p>

<p>The most legendary howler of all is known as Terror Incarnate. This creature
managed to devour the fear felt by an entire army as it died, and this excess
power turned it into something like a demigod of terror. Its eventual progeny
inherited its powers.</p>

<p>There’s some fuzzy edges in their lore. It mentions howlers attacking people in
the middle world and in the Underdark, mentions associations with shadar-kai,
but gives the creature an Elemental origin. I think they might fit better as
either Natural or Shadow. Fortunately origin doesn’t influence
stats. Alternatively you might go the other way and make them a type of demon.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, Howlers are Elemental Magical Beasts. They have Darkvision
and a Speed of 8. They understand Abyssal but can’t speak.</p>

<h3 id="howler-dread-hound">Howler Dread Hound</h3>

<p>One of those young specimens that kills too quickly. They gather in huge packs
to massacre whole villages at once. They are Medium Level 9 Minion Controllers
with a speed of 8. At Int 5, they’re sapient but dim.</p>

<p>As with all “dog monsters”, their basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong>. This one does a
bit of damage and slides the target 1 square on a hit. They also have a
<strong>Piercing Spines</strong> trait that deals the same damage as the bite to anyone who
misses them with a melee attack. The ability that gives them their name is the
<strong>Dread Howl</strong> encounter power, a fear attack that catches every enemy in a
Close Blast 5 and targets Will. A hit does a bit of psychic damage and makes the
target grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>These are minions, so there will always be a lot of them when they appear. A bit
of orchestration could ensure PCs grant combat advantage for most of the fight.</p>

<h3 id="howler-doom-mastiff">Howler Doom Mastiff</h3>

<p>An older, fully developed howler who has learned the value of prolonged
psychological torture. They roam ruins and tunnels in small packs, looking for
victims to terrify. They are Large Level 13 Skirmishers with 129 HP and a speed
of 8.</p>

<p>Doom Mastiffs are large enough to ride, and they have the Mount keyword. As they
have Int 9, I think this is more of an equal partnership thing than the rider
“keeping” the howler as a mount or pet. The <strong>Guarding Spines</strong> trait gives the
mastiff’s rider a +2 bonus to AC. Its <strong>Piercing Spines</strong> does 10 damage to
anyone who misses the howler <em>or its rider</em> with a melee attack.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>Bites</strong> are a little weak but can be used as part of a <strong>Loping
Bite</strong> attack that allows the mastiff to shift half its speed and bite. Their
<strong>Terrifying Howl</strong> is a lot stronger than the dread hound’s: it deals 10
ongoing psychic damage to those it hits, and makes them grant combat advantage
(save ends). Targets adjacent to the mastiff <em>can’t save agains this</em>. Finally,
this is a (recharge 6+) power instead of an encounter power. So it might happen
more than once!</p>

<p>Being all about that delicious fear, the mastiff will open with a howl and then
will do its best to stick to one of the affected PCs, using move actions and
Loping Bites to do so. It’s smart enough to prefer a squishy victim over a
defender, too.</p>

<h3 id="howler-terror-incarnate">Howler Terror Incarnate</h3>

<p>The one that devoured an army’s collective fear and became a demigod of
terror. It’s a Large Level 22 Lurker with 155 HP.</p>

<p>The terror’s <strong>Shadow Spines</strong> work a lot like that of its lesser relatives, but
deal necrotic damage. It also has a <strong>Terror Incarnate</strong> aura (3) that deals 10
psychic damage per turn to any enemies inside.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>bite</strong> deals the same damage as that of the level 13 doom mastiff,
which I’m almost sure is a typo. It can also possess people with the <strong>Shadow of
Terror</strong> power. This is a melee attack that can only be used against people who
can’t see the howler, and who haven’t been possessed during the fight yet. On a
hit, the howler is removed from play and the target is dominated (save
ends). The target’s at-will attacks deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage and target
Will instead of their original defenses. The posession ends when the target
passes a save or takes radiant damage - when this happens, the howler reappears
adjacen to them. The target is then dazed (save ends).</p>

<p>Their final attack is the <strong>Death Howl</strong>, another blast attack. This one does
immediate psychic damage and dazes (save ends) on a hit.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Lope</strong> (recharge 4+) provides the ability to set up for a Shadow of
Terror attack: it allows the howler to become invisible for a turn and move its
speed.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>Howlers are far from the first dog monsters to show up in D&amp;D. They’re not even
the first dog monsters with fear powers. Still, you can use them in your
campaign in place of wargs and other similarly-leveled canine menaces for added
variety. The Doom Mastiff’s ability to act as a mount also makes it an possible
replacement for a Nightmare. Anyone who would ride an Evil Fire Horse would also
certainly ride an Evil Fear Dog.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This is kind of an addendum to my earlier post on <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/08/03/merging-weapon-skills.html">Merging Weapon Skills in
GURPS</a>, which occurred to me after reading this other post in <a href="https://aftertheogre.blogspot.com/2022/08/df-novices-merging-weapon-skills.html">After the
Ogre</a>. I realized I hadn’t mentioned Shield skills, but I had been merging
them for so long I had forgotten that wasn’t the standard.</p>

<p>In my GURPS games, there is only one shield skill:</p>

<h3 id="shield-dxe">Shield (DX/E)</h3>

<p>This skill merges <strong>Shield</strong>, <strong>Shield (Buckler)</strong> and <strong>Force
Shield</strong>. There is still a mechanical difference between a shield that’s held in
the hand and one that’s strapped to the arm, but both of them use the same
skill and there is no familiarity penalty from switching between them.</p>

<p>If you’re using the optional rules for Familiarity Penalties in the previous
post, such a penalty would definitely apply when someone used to traditional
shields wields a weightless force shield, and vice-versa. As a reminder, that’s
a -2 penalty to Shield that goes away after a few hours of practice during
downtime, at no point cost.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>As I mentioned way back in the MM/MV post about <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/05/16/hag.html">Hags</a>, they’re a species of
fey that resemble fairytale witches in appearance and behavior. They tend to
have great knowledge of magic, but also tend use it to further selfish and
greedy schemes.</p>

<p>Their basic lore remains the same in the MM3, which also adds that hags are
keepers of secrets. They’re always after new treasure and new secrets, generally
of the type that increases their power. They use divination magic, pacts with
mortals, and a network of portals that weaves through the Feywild and the middle
world, which they also use to keep connected to each other.</p>

<p>Hags are of course loathe to part with any of their secrets for
free. Adventurers seeking information from a hag must usually agree to do them a
favor, which commonly means doing something nasty to one of the hag’s many
enemies. These enemies might include archfey, demons, devils, other hags…</p>

<p>Hags are Medium Fey Humanoids and have Low-Light Vision. Everything else varies
with stat blocks, which are usually split along the lines of which type of magic
a hag uses in combat. I don’t think they’re supposed to be different sub-species
or anything of the sort.</p>

<h2 id="pact-hag">Pact Hag</h2>

<p>This is your typical “sinister village witch”, living in a hut out of sight of
the village itself. This location is far enough away to deter curious casuals,
but still close enough that someone who really wants to make a deal with the hag
can easily reach it.</p>

<p>A pact hag is much more willing to negotiate with these visitors than most of
her relatives, though she’s still just as prone to seeking deals that benefit
her more than they do the petitioner. She usually keep ogres, trolls, and
dangerous fey fauna as bodyguards. They’re initially out of sight, but can
arrive quickly if a fight breaks out.</p>

<p>Pact hags are Level 11 Controllers with the Leader tag and 115 HP. In a fight,
they use all sorts of fun mind control magic, starting with a <strong>Pact of
Obedience</strong> aura (5) that allows allies inside to spend 5 HP to reroll a missed
attack roll with a +2 bonus to the reroll.</p>

<p>Her basic melee attack is a <strong>Compelling Staff</strong> that deals light damage but
forces the target to make a melee basic attack against a target of the hag’s
choice.</p>

<p>Her basic ranged attack is named <strong>Pact of Compelled Obedience</strong> and does no
damage at all, but it dominates the target for a turn instead. Fun (TM) for the
whole party.</p>

<p>Her special attacks follow along the same lines. <strong>Pact of Choked Aggression</strong>
also doesn’t do immediate damage and inflicts a nasty curse on the target:
they take 10 psychic damage the first time they hit a creature during one of
their turns. This lasts until the end of the encounter, or until one of the
target’s allies attacks the target. And it recharges when no enemy is affected
by the curse!</p>

<p>The other special attack is <strong>Pact of Shared Agony</strong>, which the hag can only
use while bloodied. It’s another curse: until the end of the encounter, if the
target is within 10 squares of the hag, they take 10 psychic damage whenever the
hag takes any amount of damage. This power recharges whenever the hag misses
with it, so she can keep using it until she hits.</p>

<p>This big emphasis on indirect damage means pact hags work best when surrounded
by those beefy bodyguards, and will probably try to flee the fight once they
become bloodied. Pact of Shared Agony is good for discouraging pursuit by melee
strikers. Their “Pact” theme makes them a good patron for a heroic-tier fey
warlock! This patron hag might either level up as the PC does, or you can have a
story where the PC “trades up” to a better teacher Sith-style once the hag’s
demands become untenable.</p>

<h2 id="dream-hag">Dream Hag</h2>

<p>These hags, as you might imagine, focus on dream magic. They can send dream
visions to people, a power they use to lure their (or their paying customer’s)
enemies to traps. However, the constraints of dream magic mean the hag doesn’t
have full control over the content of the visions, so genuinely useful
information tends to slip through.</p>

<p>Dream Hags are Level 19 Controllers with 179 HP. They project a <strong>Nightmare
Weaver</strong> aura (3) that causes unconscious enemies inside to become dominated for
a turn. They stand up and perform one action of the hag’s choice while still
remaining unconscious. The wording here makes it clear that this puppetry
continues while the enemies remain inside the aura.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Staff of Mindless Reverie</strong>, which damages and dazes
for a turn on a hit. Their at-will ranged attack are weaponized <strong>Nightmare
Visions</strong> that deal psychic damage and slide the target 5 squares.</p>

<p>And then we have the powers that make people unconscious so the hag can exploit
her aura. Both affect a Close Blast 5! <strong>Dust of Dreams</strong> (recharge 5+) dazes on
a hit (save ends), and this worsens to unconsciousness after the first failed
save. <strong>Sleep’s Undeniable Grasp</strong> (Encounter) makes its targets unconscious
right away. It’s a (save ends) effect and it also ends if the target is
attacked.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s possible for the hag to put the whole party to sleep at once if she’s
really lucky. This <em>shouldn’t</em> be an automatic total party kill if you run the
abilities as written, though - sleeping PCs can still roll saves to end the
effect, and in the case of the encounter power they also wake up if attacked. Of
course, this attack will probably be an auto-crit if it comes from an enemy, so
it’s still a problem.</p>

<p>I also think it’s acceptable to fudge things a little if Team Monster’s goal is
something other than killing the PCs. If the goal is capturing them, or taking
them somewhere else, then you can fade to black if the whole party falls asleep
and have them wake up at that place.</p>

<h2 id="mist-hag">Mist Hag</h2>

<p>These are among the most powerful of hags. They’ve been accumulating secrets,
artifacts and power for ages, and they dwell in the deepest forests of the
Feywild. Their dwellings are surrounded by a thick mist that they have full
control over. If the Death Hag from the MM1 was a “Baba Yaga wannabe”, this one
is closest to the real deal. She’s pretty much an arch-fey herself. The Mist Hag
does not deal with devils - devils deal with <em>her</em>. A few of them probably have
been pressed into service as her bodyguards. Other possible allies include epic
undead, fomorians, and so on.</p>

<p>A Mist Hag is a Level 27 Controller with the Leader tag and 247 HP. She has a
zippy ground speed of 8, instead of the standard 6 for a medium humanoid. Her
aura is a <strong>Mist Shroud</strong> that makes allies within 1 square insubstantial.</p>

<p>The hag’s <strong>Mist Staff</strong> damages and pushes targets 5 squares. During the push,
targets act as if they had the Phasing trait, which means the hag can push them
through walls and other creatures. The final destination square must still be
empty, but the hag doesn’t need to have a line of effect to it or the other
squares of the push. If you want to get cute with this ability, include a piece
of hazardous terrain surrounded by walls in your battle map.</p>

<p>Her basic attack is <strong>Mist on the Wind</strong>, which damages and removes the
target from play for a turn! The target returns to play in a square of the hag’s
choice within 4 squares of its original position.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Choking Mist</strong> (recharge 5+) is a ranged attack serves as a reminder
that the PCs are breathing the same mist the hag can control. It deals heavy
physical damage and ongoing 20 damage (save ends). Every time the target fails a
save, the hag can slide them 3 squares.</p>

<p>When an enemy gets to within 2 squares of the hag, the hag can use <strong>Maze of
Mist</strong> to mess with them. This is a triggered effect that doesn’t require an
action, so it can happen every time the trigger happens. When it does, the hag
can roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, she slides the triggering enemy 1
square. This makes closing to melee reach a lot harder than usual.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>As I said back in the original article, I like hags when they are portrayed as
their own species of fey being that don’t necessarily need to obey natural
laws. They’re fairytale witches, with a penchant for doing the things fairytale
witches do.</p>

<p>That said, I think treating each hag stat block as an entirely different species
is going a bit too far. I prefer to treat those as differences of skill and
training.</p>
