        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The Neverwinter Wood dominates the northern half of our regional map and is much
larger than the city that gives it its name. It’s a classic Creepy Forest, where
the canopies block out all sunlight and even in the safer trails it seems like
someone is always watching you from the shadows. And that’s just the baseline
mood - the Wood is also currently full of ill-intentioned outsiders.</p>

<p>Characters in a Neverwinter campaign might need to trek through this place for
any number of reasons. This section of the chapter covers some of the Wood’s
most notable places, but it’s large enough that you could run a full
hex-crawling campaign on it.</p>

<p>The book actually includes rules for a “Creepy Woods” hazardous terrain type
that can be included in exploration or combat maps. Anyone on this terrain when
a fight starts must roll a save before rolling Initiative - if they fail,
they’re surprised during the first round. They also gain a -2 to Will while on
Creepy spaces and when they fail a Perception check there they always think they
heard something that’s not there.</p>

<p>This first post covers the “smaller” areas and “standard” geographical features
of the Woods. It also contains several faction strongholds that will each get
their own post.</p>

<h2 id="the-crags">The Crags</h2>

<p>This is a large mountain range that splits the Wood in two, running from NE to
SW. Mount Hotenow is the most notable place in the Crags, as it’s where the
Neverwinter River starts and also the source of the eruption that caused the
cataclysm.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more besides the volcano though - this is a typical D&amp;D mountain
range full of monsters, caves, and hidden valleys and is also rumored to contain
paths to lost Gauntlgrym. Whether those exist or not, the range does definitely
contain a lot of old Delzoun outposts.</p>

<p>Those outposts will give the Heir of Delzoun something to marvel at even if they
don’t find a path to the lost city here. They’re also targets for Netherese
plundering in their unceasing quest for magic items to burn.</p>

<h2 id="iceless-waterways">Iceless Waterways</h2>

<p>All of the Wood’s rivers are warmed by Hotenow’s heat, so they never freeze even
during winter, and generally act to keep the forest warm and untouched by the
seasons. They teem with non-monstrous aquatic wildlife but never gave rise to
monsters - except for the River Morgur, the northernmost tributary of the
Neverwinter. It’s still iceless, but also has river monsters.</p>

<h2 id="bones-of-thundertree">Bones of Thundertree</h2>

<p>Thundertree used to be a logging village that produced a lot of quality
timber. It was completely destroyed by the eruption, and all of its surviving
inhabitants fled to never return. The place is now haunted by possessed plant
monsters (take plant monster stat blocks of your choice and give them undead
traits). Aside from them, only the dwarf Favria, leader of the more violent
faction of the Ashmadai, calls this place home. She lives in an underground wine
cellar.</p>

<p>I was given to understand her whole Ashmadai sub-faction used this place as a
base, so it looks like there was a miscommunication between different authors
here. I’d probably add them here if I ran a Neverwinter campaign. Maybe say
those plant monsters are possessed by <em>devils</em> instead of undead. How do you
like evil treants with 20 fire resistance?</p>

<h2 id="the-tower-of-twilight">The Tower of Twilight</h2>

<p>There used to be a wizard’s tower built in the middle of a lake island. It, and
the bridge leading to it, only appeared at night, becoming more solid as the sun
set and fading out again when it rose. During the Spellplague, the tower
vanished entirely and did not return until after the cataclysm. Now, it appears
sporadically with no set schedule, and no one knows what goes on in there
anymore.</p>

<p>One suggestion from the book is that the tower fades out of <em>time</em> when it’s not
visible in the physical world, and the people inside only experience the passage
of time when it appears. This mean that the tower’s wizard and their apprentices
and staff might still be there, either absorbed in their studies as if this was
still 3e or struggling with what is to them a very recent bout of “original
strain” Spellplague.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/09/18/neverwinter-helms-hold.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: Helm&#39;s Hold</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>We’re getting outside of the city proper now! Helm’s Hold is a small town
located on the edge of the Neverwinter Wood, built around a monastery and
cathedral dedicated to the god Helm. It’s about a day’s travel northeast of
Neverwinter.</p>

<p>The town’s proximity to the Wood and its traditions of rugged individualism give
it big “American frontier” vibes, tempered a bit by the monastery’s own
culture. Helm used to be the god of guardians, and the monastery’s purpose since
its ancient founding is to give sanctuary to those who have none. The monastery
came first, and the town slowly grew around it.</p>

<p>About a year before the Spellplague, when the inhabitants had just laid the
foundation for the cathedral, Helm died. The grieving priests and citizens
finished the huge building as a monument in his honor, and kept its purpose as a
sanctuary, welcoming people of all faiths.</p>

<p>My experience of Helm’s Hold from the computer games and reading this book is
that the place’s narrative purpose is to be infiltrated and secretly taken over
by the current campaign’s Big Bads. It happened in the first computer game
(ancient underground civilization), it happened again shortly before the
Spellplague (Netherese), and now it’s happening once more (the aboleths). We’re
headed for a plot pileup here because the Netherese are also trying to
infiltrate the town anew, via their werewolf minions.</p>

<h2 id="lurking-threats">Lurking Threats</h2>

<p>Those mysterious disappearances and murders are caused not by the spellscarred,
but by the Grey Wolf Uthgardt, who have been ordered by their Netherese masters
to infiltrate the town and cause chaos. They’re proficient at disguising
themselves as locals or pilgrims, which lets them get into position to wolf out
at night and go hunting. The core of their force hides out in the Wood. The
Netherese don’t think the Hold is strategically valuable, they just want to keep
the barbarians occupied until they’re needed in their true function as
expendable muscle to throw against the Thayans.</p>

<p>The two barbarian-themed PCs are quite likely to end up here, and a peaceful
resolution to the Grey Wolf plot would involve convincing them the Netherese are
both evil and not interested in the tribe’s well-being. This has to be done
subtly, though, as they are likely to attack the Pack Outcast on sight.</p>

<p>And of course there’s also the cathedral itself, which is currently being run by
Rohini’s group and thus is a secret aboleth center of power. No one else knows
about this currently, though ironically the AbSov is also interested in solving
the murders because it will reduce the suspicion currently directed at them.</p>

<h2 id="the-hold-and-environs">The Hold and Environs</h2>

<p>The Hold’s mission as a sanctuary turned into the region’s premier treatment
center for Spellplague victims, a duty which only became heavier about a year
ago when Lord Neverember made it his official policy to send any such victims he
finds in Neverwinter to the cathedral.</p>

<p>The rest of the region tends to see the spellscarred as dangerous freaks, but
the inhabitants of the Hold see them as unfortunate victims affected by a
horrible curse. Still, the overwhelming influx of new patients has been testing
their open stance, as the city had to do a lot of rush construction to
accommodate them all, with limited success. You can find newer buildings
haphazardly constructed between older structures, their quality dubious due to
the Hold’s chronic labor shortage. Most skilled builders are over on
Neverwinter, where the work pays better.</p>

<p>The Hold’s citizens are further stressed out by the recent spate of mysterious
murders and disappearances, which the more conservative among them have started
blaming on the spellscarred. A group of spellscarred activists calling
themselves the Heirs of Azure has sprung up to try to counter the distrust
heaped upon their community. However, the Mintarn detachment sent by Neverember
to help keep the peace isn’t having much success tracking down the real
culprits, tensions keep increasing.</p>

<p>The city is governed by a council of elected Speakers who meet at a former
tavern named The Dragon’s Gauntlet. They’re also split on the issue of the
spellscarred, though the official stance is still receptive since current Chief
Speaker is in that camp. The council’s collective power is waning, as there are
enough mercs in town that they could declare martial law unopposed. Their
commander, however, is uncharacteristically responsible and dutiful, so the
order won’t come from him.</p>

<h3 id="heartward">Heartward</h3>

<p>The market plaza, so named because there’s a shrine to Sune here. Fights are
frequent because resources are scarce and prices high. Every now and then, at
night, a major haunting happens here and a bunch of ghosts goes through the
motions of market life. Some crew the stalls, some walk around making purchase
and talk to each other. Most of their words are gibberish, but some are
prophetic.</p>

<h3 id="old-dirty-dwarf">Old Dirty Dwarf</h3>

<p>And old, respected, and dirty tavern, with a reputation as the place for new
arrivals to go in order to get the lay of the land and hear the latest news from
the Hold. The owner is friendly to the spellscarred, but some of the staff
aren’t. Agents of the Prophet keep an eye here at all times and report news to
their boss.</p>

<h3 id="scar-alley">Scar Alley</h3>

<p>The ground under this neighborhood softened during the Spellplague, causing many
of its buildings to sink and crack. Nowadays it’s a barely-standing,
precariously-patrolled slum that is home to the most deformed of the
spellscarred, those even the Hold shuns. It’s also filled with shady characters
and the occasional monster hiding out in an abandoned ruin.</p>

<h2 id="helms-cathedral">Helm’s Cathedral</h2>

<p>The aging faithful of Helm’s Cathedral now share it with a contingent of Oghma’s
priests who arrived to set up a sanatorium for spellscarred patients. Brother
Satarin commands the former: he’s a 160 year old dwarf who was an acolyte before
Helm’s death. Rohini the Prophet officially commands the latter, and is the de
facto boss of the whole place. As we learned a few posts ago, she’s a former
succubus turned aberrant creature, and serves the Abolethic Sovereignity, as do
all her subordinates. She holds the loyalty of Helm’s old priests because some
of her (fake) prophecies hint at his return.</p>

<p>The surface levels of the cathedral are airy and well-lit. The underground is
far less pleasant and houses the sanatorium for the most “severe” cases. Rohini
spends a lot of time down there “treating” them (i.e, turning them into
foulspawn). They go out for exercise every day, and the foulspawn among them are
only detectable as such by people specifically looking for them.</p>

<h3 id="the-warrens">The Warrens</h3>

<p>This was a failed attempt to expand the city’s drainage system, abandoned when
the dig broke into the monastery’s old crypts and was overwhelmed by
monsters. It became a kind of unofficial sanatorium for monstrous humanoids
afflicted by the plague, who find no acceptance even in a tolerant city such as
this. Goblins, kobolds and others venture into the city to steal food for
themselves, and this has given rise to rumors of fey hauntings. I think it still
connects to the rest of the crypts, described below, and would be a good
alternate route for parties who want to sneak in. I’d probably run that as a
negotiation focused adventure rather than a classic murdery crawl, at least
until the PCs get to the crypts where the actual bad guys are.</p>

<h3 id="crypts-of-the-vigilant-eye">Crypts of the Vigilant Eye</h3>

<p>These crypts lie beneath the Cathedral, and predate its construction. Though the
levels closer to the surface were clearly used by priests of Helm from the older
monastery, things get more ancient and mysterious the deeper you go. There’s a
big vertical pit full of side niches that could only be reached by flight or
teleportation, and is now full of gargoyles. There’s a hallway full of gigantic
robed skeleton statues that don’t resemble any sort of Helmite iconography.</p>

<p>And all that is without counting the twisting of the place by Spellplague
energies and its current occupation by AbSov agents and foulspawn. Or the
trapped Grey Wolf recon force that still hasn’t managed to find a way out
through all of that.</p>

<p>The deepest levels turn into caverns that were excavated and mutated by the
Symphony of Madness, turning into a fungal underground swamp. These are
Chartilifax’s hunting grounds, so they probably contain all sorts of creatures
that are tasty to dragons and dangerous to adventurers. From here you can enter
a pulsating tunnel to the brain-like chamber containing the Hex Locus, a bronze
coffer that acts as a repeater for the Symphony of Madness.</p>

<p>The Locus chamber can also be reached via a teleportation circle somewhere in
the crypt levels, and Rohini will use that as soon as she learns someone is
inside. She is linked to the artifact and can feel when someone enters its
room. This is likely where any final confrontation against her and her pet
dragon will occur.</p>

<h2 id="plot-hooks">Plot Hooks</h2>

<p>The Spellscarred Harbinger will most likely be told to go here soon after the
campaign starts. The Pack Outcast and Uthgardt Barbarian’s pursuit of the Grey
Wolf might also bring them here early.</p>

<p>The city’s werewolf problem and the creepy happenings at the cathedral should be
obvious enough to get the PCs investigating, and the growing tension between
locals and refugees would make a fine secondary plot line.</p>

<p>Rohini herself would not appear immediately villainous - she would instead
attempt to coopt the PCs and get them to help with her goals. By default that’s
serving the AbSov, but the book offers a few alternatives. Perhaps she wants to
break free of them and would secretly help them destroy the Hex Locus instead of
protecting it. She is of course still a devil, so she might double-cross the PCs
once she has what she wants.</p>

<p>Independent of that, Mordai Vell is working hard to woo her, aware that she’s a
devil in disguise but unaware of all the rest. So <em>he</em> might hire the PCs as
go-betweens in his courtship efforts. That’d be a fun way to introduce the AbSov
and Ashmadai to the campaign.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I tried to be fair and write a complete summary of the material in the book, but
the truth is that I have a hard time caring about what’s going on in the town of
Helm’s Hold proper. The original Neverwinter Nights computer game colors my
perceptions here - it skipped the “town” bit entirely and placed you directly
inside the monastery, which it treated as a dungeon. I only learned the Hold was
an actual town once I read this book.</p>

<p>I feel like most campaigns will go a similar route, focusing all of their “urban
intrigue” creative energy on Neverwinter itself and treating the Hold as a
mostly-skipped prelude to the big delve into the cathedral and the crypts
beneath. On the other hand, it would also be possible to do the reverse and
ignore the big city depending on your party composition. There are several
themes that have more reason to start at the Hold than at Neverwinter, like the
Spellscarred Harbinger, the Uthgardt Barbarian, and the Pack Outcast.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>We already saw several underground danger spots in the city. Neverdeath
Cemetery, the dungeons of Castle Never, and of course the Chasm. But there are
even more beyond those. The Mintarn mercs usually stay on the surface, so every
one of these places can be considered “dungeon-like”.</p>

<h2 id="shattered-sewers">Shattered Sewers</h2>

<p>Neverwinter had an extensive sewer system that’s still largely ruined. It makes
for a great way to move about the entire city undetected, but it’s hazardous to
navigate and filled with both monsters and other people who don’t want to be
discovered.</p>

<h2 id="kraken-tunnels">Kraken Tunnels</h2>

<p>This is an underground complex with a floor plan that vaguely resembles an
octopus. It used to be the former headquarters of the Kraken Society, a criminal
syndicate specializing in slavery. Now it’s the headquarters for the Nashers
faction of the Sons of Alagondar.</p>

<p>The complex is build right above an underground canal that links to the sea, and
this canal is the home of an actual kraken. The Spellplague reduced the monster
to bestial intelligence. The Society used to feed it and keep it as a guardian
beast, and the Nashers have continued the practice. The complex has several
floor openings through which the creature can attack intruders.</p>

<p>The kraken was trained by the Society to recognize anyone bearing an amulet with
its symbol as a friend - it attacks all who <em>don’t</em> have this amulet on
them. The Nashers know this and carry Kraken Society amulets with them when
inside the complex.</p>

<p>There’s a tunnel here that links the Kraken Tunnels to the Dead Rats’ HQ through
the sewers, which the Nashers use to talk and trade with them. The Rats don’t
yet know the trick to avoiding the Kraken, but it’s just a matter of time until
they find out and attempt to take over.</p>

<p>It’s possible the Nashers might end up releasing the kraken into the river or
the docks as a sort of weapon of mass destruction if they become desperate
enough. The aboleths could also try to get to it in order to search its mind for
secrets from back when it was sapient.</p>

<h2 id="dead-rat-hole">Dead Rat Hole</h2>

<p>This is a section of the sewers that has been taken over by the Neverwinter
chapter of the Dead Rats. It’s marked with gang signs gouged into the sewer
walls, and packed with both loot and trash collected by the gangers. Their
leader, Rsolk, holds court at a set of caves near the shores of
Blacklake. There’s a trap here that can let the waters of the lake in and
“flush” the whole complex.</p>

<p>These Dead Rats are <em>not</em> familiar with the Dead Rat Deserter PC, contrary to
what I thought before. Looks like word hasn’t got to them yet. A bold Deserter
might try to infiltrate the gang and perhaps even challenge Rsolk for
leadership. This starts as a one-on-one duel but turns into a standard mass
fight once he’s bloodied. And of course he flushes the lair if it looks like his
side will lose.</p>

<h2 id="tunnels-and-trenches">Tunnels and Trenches</h2>

<p>The sewers around the Chasm area are partly collapsed, forming trenches where
the street above was destroyed and tunnels where it hasn’t. This and the influx
of non-sapient monsters provides good cover for the AbSov’s smarter agents to
infiltrate the River District or to escape the city and head to Helm’s Hold and
other places.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/09/10/neverwinter-chasm.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: The Chasm</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The southeast quadrant of Neverwinter is where a huge chasm opened during the
cataclysm, a chasm which has been disgorging a constant stream of mutant
monsters ever since. As if that wasn’t enough, staying near the rift for too
long also makes people go mad. The other quadrants of the city only survive
because they managed to isolate themselves from this one somehow.</p>

<h2 id="the-ruined-city">The Ruined City</h2>

<p>This isn’t a “bad part of town” like the River District. There’s nothing
“town-like” about this expanse of ruined buildings and twisted streets. By
setting foot in here you’re already on a proper dungeon delve. No one does this
much any more, since few who try ever return and those who do come back changed.</p>

<p>PCs might be hired to search for someone who vanished here. Or they might end up
sleepwalking here due to the Chasm’s influence and need to fight their way
out. If they have a Spellscarred Harbinger, that character is going to feel an
odd connection to the Chasm and a desire to explore it.</p>

<p>As we already learned from the faction descriptions, the Chasm goes all the way
down to the Underdark, where it opens on an underground lake whose bottom houses
a Spellplague pocket and the AbSov research base built around it. The
Plaguechanged monsters are projects and rejects created by the aboleths - they
have been growing more powerful and “efficient” as of late, as the creatures
improve their designs.</p>

<p>Even if no other reason draws the characters to explore the Chasm region, they
will eventually have to come here in a campaign where the AbSov is the greatest
threat. Getting to them requires not only traversing the ruined city on the
surface, but also going down the Chasm itself.</p>

<h2 id="the-upper-reach">The Upper Reach</h2>

<p>When descending the Chasm, the first few hundred feet might seem fairly mundane,
but after that the landscape starts resembling the Elemental Chaos or Abyss more
and more. Elemental energies surge up from the depths at irregular
intervals. The walls are harder to climb, with handholds appearing and vanishing
at random and occasional blasts of fire or wind erupting from them. Earthmotes
abound, some drifting slowly and others bashing against the walls.</p>

<p>Monsters can be found climbing the walls or flying from the depths. Even those
who have no flying ability can be seen floating up in bolts of chaos magic,
particularly if they were sent to attack the surface.</p>

<h3 id="creeping-madness">Creeping Madness</h3>

<p>At this point the Spellplague radiation is already so intense that characters
are already at risk of contracting Creeping Madness, a magical disease
similar to the plague itself. They must make a DC 10 Endurance check on every
short or long rest to avoid contracting it. Further resistance rolls also use
Endurance, with a Maintain DC of 10 and an Improve DC of 15.</p>

<p>Stage 1 inflicts a -2 penalty to Will and Initiative, and a +1 bonus to psychic
attacks. Stage 2 eats a healing surge and inflicts -4 to Perception and
Insight. Stage 3 inflicts a -2 penalty to all skill checks, and makes the
victim’s attacks deal +1d6 psychic damage. Stage 4 drives you mad and makes you
permanently dazed.</p>

<p>Unlike most diseases I think it’s possible to recover from the final stage
through Endurance rolls. If a character fully recovers from stage 3 or later,
they also gain a spellscar. The Spellscarred Harbinger has a +2 on all Endurance
checks against this disease.</p>

<h2 id="the-twisted-fane">The Twisted Fane</h2>

<p>This is the apparent bottom of the chasm, a broken wasteland whose rock pulses
as if it was alive. There’s an alien-looking black fortress here, the Twisted
Fane, which is built around an eerily shining crystal. The Fane is guarded by a
colony of fouslpawn which will fight to repel any intruders they detect. The
monsters attack on sight and fight to the death.</p>

<p>All of this is a ruse put in place by the Aboleths to stall any would-be
heroes. They expect these interlopers to slay the disposable foulspawn, destroy
the useless crystal, and go back home thinking they solved the problem of the
Chasm. PCs can make several different skill tests to notice the crystal doesn’t
have any actual power, the foulspawn are acting strangely because of mental
domination, and that there are tunnels hidden in the area around the fortress,
leading deeper underground.</p>

<h2 id="plaguechanged-warrens">Plaguechanged Warrens</h2>

<p>This is an enormous chunk of rock wedged between the two walls of the Chasm. It
could be moved by sufficient force, but only has room to go up. The top surface
is where the Twisted Fane was built, and the inside is a maze of twisty passages
that end in gross “breeding pits” where creatures are stuffed into fleshy
cocoons and mutated by Spellplague magic directed by the Symphony of
Madness. This is where all the plaguechanged monsters that attack the surface
come from.</p>

<p>This deep into the chasm, characters have a -2 penalty to Endurance to resist
creeping madness. At the bottom levels of the rock, they also start to hear the
physical sounds of the Symphony of Madness, which inflicts a -2 penalty to Will
on all non-aberrant creatures.</p>

<h2 id="the-blue-cauldron">The Blue Cauldron</h2>

<p>The underside of the Warrens opens into a large cavern mostly filled by an
underground lake. The water glows blue and bubbles as if boiling due to the
Spellplague pocket at the bottom.</p>

<p>There is no physical way to safely climb down to the water; characters must
either fly or fall down the 60-foot drop. There is an “unfettered travel”
magical effect put in place by the aboleths that lets them swim in the air
inside this cave. Characters trained in Arcana might be able to hijack that and
be able to swim through the air as if it was water.</p>

<p>At a depth of 20 feet, the PCs can find bubbles holding particularly interesting
prisoners. At the bottom of the lake, is the research lab itself. Any characters
who get to this cave will immediately draw the attention of the aboleths, both
because they proved themselves a major threat and because they might make
excellent research subjects. The aboleths themselves are quite powerful and
might also be plaguechanged.</p>

<p>At this depth, characters have a -4 penalty to resist creeping madness.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>The surface of the Chasm could make for a decent hex- or point-crawling map as
characters try to find a safe path to the rift itself. As described, it seems
the Chasm itself is a very meaty dungeon delve. None of its separate areas
described above get maps, so the GM can make maps that suit their
purposes.</p>

<p>Sure, once you’re here you know you need to go <em>down</em>, but depending on how long
the GM wants you to spend inside each of the named areas could vary in
complexity from the equivalent of a single “room” with a big battle in it to an
entire labyrinthine dungeon level where finding the way down is a significant
challenge in itself.</p>
