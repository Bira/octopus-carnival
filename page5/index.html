          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/10/23/neverwinter-evernight.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: Evernight Overview</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Evernight is Neverwinter’s reflection on the Shadowfell, but it’s also a city in
its own right, inhabited by a large number of undead and undead-adjacent people
(cultists, necromancers, and the like). This book doesn’t go too deep into its
history, but it does give me the impression Evernight has existed for a long
time. It was probably described in a previous edition when the Shadowfell was
called “the plane of Shadow”.</p>

<p>Evernight is ruled by a Tribunal composed by its most influent citizens, all of
whom are ghouls and ghasts who worship Orcus and his exarch Dorensain. The
Tribunal makes the laws and settles disputes. It does the latter by deciding who
is right and eating the loser.</p>

<p>The city is very dangerous for living mortals who aren’t citizens, though it’s a
bit <em>less</em> dangerous than you’d think. Only its vampire and ghoul inhabitants
feel the need to feed on the living, and since the ambient energies of the
Shadowfell help sustain them this happens much less often than it would in the
world. Mortals and undead alike can apply for citizenship. Mortal citizens gain
legal protection from random attacks on the street, though they should probably
keep their token of citizenship within easy reach at all times. Living merchants
who pass through the city on the way to other locations can also acquire tokens
of safe passage.</p>

<p>The legal status of a mortal who doesn’t have any of that can best be summed up
as “fresh meat”, but even that isn’t an automatic death sentence. Undead who see
the living brazenly walking down the streets of Evernight tend to assume they
belong there, and will only challenge that assumption if given reason to be
suspicious. Such as when the “tourists” make horrified faces at the deeply
fucked up stuff that happens in the city’s routine unlife.</p>

<p>There are no official portals between Evernight and Neverwinter, but the planar
membrane separating the two is awfully thin and becomes fully permeable in
certain places known as “dusk crevices”. These crossings link a place in
Evernight to its corresponding worldly location, which is always in dim light or
darkness. Some are fixed, some temporary or mobile. They’re the true cause of
most spooky stories about disappearances in Neverwinter since before the
Spellplague. Mortals who fall through these crevices into Evernight make up a
significant portion of the diet of its ghoul and vampire population.</p>

<p>Despite its (literally!) ghoulish culture and society, Evernight is a major
Shadowfell trade hub, so it often sees passing caravans that link it to other
settlements in the plane. One of the trade routes passing through here is the
Shadowfell Road, a mystical path that has a ritual component. It only exists if
approached and traversed in a very specific way. The Thayans use it to supply
the Dread Ring, and the Tribunal allows them to use it for that purpose because
the Thayans pay them in <em>people</em>. A similar arrangement allows the Netherese to
maintain an embassy in the city and use their own share of trade and supply
routes.</p>

<p>Part of the reason the Tribunal accepts these deals is that both factions
represent powerful nations who are very adept at necromancy, but the ghouls
still draw the line at permitting hostilities within city limits. Evernight is
neutral territory, and violating this edict is one of the things that would
cause the Tribunal to take drastic action against the rule-breaker. In practice
that means conflict within the city takes the form of sordid spy stories of
intrigue and assassination.</p>

<p>The city did suffer some changes during the cataclysm. A reflection of the
Chasm, known locally as the Demon Pit, opened up in the corresponding Shadowfell
coordinates. And while the eruption of mount Hotenow was a quick affair in the
world, its shadowy counterpart continues to expel a slow and steady stream of
lava that flows through the equivalent of the Neverwinter River’s bed. Sometimes
you can see crew-less ghost ships sailing the lava, docking in abandoned piers,
and leaving after a few days. All of the other horrific stuff we’ll see in the
following posts was already there before that.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Evernight comes as a bit of a surprise to me, since I think it was only
mentioned in one place in the book before this section and that mention didn’t
hint at the full scope of the thing. I’m guessing old FR hands already know all
about it, though.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Here we cover the lower strata of Gauntlgrym, where the place’s greatest dangers
live.</p>

<h2 id="duergar-mines">Duergar Mines</h2>

<p>The duergar of Gauntlgrym live in this sector, which lies deeper than most of
Gauntlgrym. The book says they’ve been here for “a few generations”, which is a
lot longer than I thought before even if these are human generations. Their
situation, however, still matches: they’ve taken over old mining tunnels and dug
new ones under the direction of their leader Kholzourl.</p>

<p>They’ve unearthed several veins of useful metal, including iron, silver, mithral
and hellthorn (the one that likes infernal enchantments). Their work is
ceaseless, grueling, and mostly done by slaves, which they replenish by
capturing any non-duergar they lay eyes on down here. Tunnels built by the
original dwarves show their characteristic sloped walls and tend to be both safe
and clean. Duergar tunnels are slapdash and hazardous, sometimes nearly vertical
due to their leader’s need to go ever deeper. Some of these shafts are so deep
that they contain semi-permanent work camps where duergar and enslaved workers
live instead of going back to the city at the end of every day.</p>

<p>The duergar don’t care about the big mithral gates. They got here from below,
via tunnels that link their camps to the deep Underdark. Some of these tunnels
have since been taken over by plaguechanged mind flayers, which are as much a
cause of injury and death as the work itself.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the mines is also a temple to Asmodeus built from desecrated
material taken from the Iron Tabernacle, which Kholzourl uses to commune with
his god and summon the occasional devil.</p>

<p>And why exactly are the duergar so intent on digging ever deeper? Only Kholzourl
and the GM really now. The book gives us several possible reasons - GMs can
either pick one or use them as inspiration for a bespoke sinister plot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hellthorn comes from a meteorite that fell here in primeval times, and the
main body of the thing contains far more power than the mere shards that have
been found so far. Maybe it contains an alien diabolic entity, millions of
years old, waiting for the moment when it is found and awakened.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The duergar want to drain the magma from Maegera’s resting place and transport
her slumbering form to some place where she can wake up and destroy an enemy
of Asmodeus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mining is just a cover and their actual goal is to observe the mind
flayers and track down their aboleth masters. The duergar suspect they want to
open a permanent portal to the Far Realm and want to hijack the procedure so
the portal leads to Hell instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or maybe the interaction of all the different types of bad magic that bathe
this region (infernal, aberrant, necromantic, oh my!) has created something
terrible underground that they wish to claim for themselves.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-fiery-pit">The Fiery Pit</h2>

<p>The lowest halls of Gauntlgrym are occupied by this enormous lake of magma, at
the center of which spins a white-hot whirlpool that marks Maegera’s resting
place.</p>

<p>The prison devised by the ancient mages if Illusk used bound water elementals
fed by a continuous stream of sea water pumped here by magical means. The system
could only be turned off by a true heir of Delzoun. The cataclysm happened when
Valindra found one to pull the lever, causing Maegera to nearly awaken. Drizzt
and his buddies prevented a full awakening back then, but the partial one was
still enough to ruin Neverwinter.</p>

<p>Unfortunately one of the channels had been destroyed, and so was not reactivated
when the rest of them were. This caused the binding to become imperfect and to
slowly fade over time. Now Maegera is dangerously close to another awakening.</p>

<p>Maegera is meant to be used as a looming threat - the bad guys want to wake her,
the PCs want to stop that from happening. PCs could fix the broken arcane pump
by using the notes found in the Waterclock Crypt in Neverwinter, which would
make the whole thing stable once more.</p>

<p>Unless of course the Heir of Delzoun PC is foolish enough to pull the “off”
switch again, causing another cataclysm. Then the whole Sword Coast is due for a
TPK.</p>

<h2 id="the-great-forge">The Great Forge</h2>

<p>In addition to the water elemental-based restraints, the structure around
Maegera also contains a complex network of pipes and wires made from all sorts
of enchanted and rune-carved metal, from copper to adamantine. These act as
conduits for the primordial’s power, which was siphoned to this sector of the
city.</p>

<p>The heat arrived at a great adamantine pyramid known as the Burning Heart, which
collected it and distributed it to the various forges and manufactories in the
sector. This heat could melt through any metal in short order, making it
extremely easy to shape and ensuring the resulting products would carry a little
of Maegera’s power with them.</p>

<p>PCs investigating the Forge can find remains of an ancient battle here, and will
find with the appropriate skill tests that the bones of the invading force
belong to legion devils.</p>

<p>The Heart itself can also be investigated by characters competent in
Arcana. Beating a DC of 11 reveals the obvious (lots of fire magic!); beating a
16 reveals this fire magic is being moderated by water magic; and beating a 23
reveals that the energy is being drained by a third party (the aboleths, which
use it in their research).</p>

<p>“Normal” areas of the Forge are subject to the Unearthly Heat terrain effect,
and since Maegera is partially unbound some terrain here can display more
overtly supernatural fire features.</p>

<p>Breaching one of the conduits from the Heart or the Forge will bathe the
offending character in primordial fire magic, making them resistant to fire and
better at using fire attacks, but vulnerable to and worse at using some other
element of the GM’s choice. Also, they get a bonus to Diplomacy with elemental
creatures and a corresponding penalty when dealing with immortal ones.</p>

<p>The character loses three healing surges when this happens, and it wasn’t clear
to me whether they could be recovered normally. The mutations are permanent
until cured by Remove Affliction or an equivalent power. A cure removes all
effects - there’s no way to keep just the beneficial ones!</p>

<h2 id="the-deepest-depths">The Deepest Depths</h2>

<p>This is the part of Gauntlgrym that connects to the Underdark. The duergar
originally came in through here, but the place has since become very
inhospitable even to them. Many species of aberrant creature dwell in these dark
passages, chief among them the plaguechanged mind flayers that are giving the
duergar trouble. Their mission is to prevent anyone from messing with Maegera,
and thus from getting in the way of the AbSov’s remote experiment with her.</p>

<p>This means they fight the duergar, but they aren’t any less evil than their
foes. Like most Underdark villains mind flayers are fond of slavery, and they
keep their captives here as well.</p>

<p>This region is also where the dwarves built secure vaults to store a variety of
horrors they found in their delves. Most are still secure, but some have been
opened over the centuries. One of the vaults that are already open is the one
that housed the original population of dire corbies, and which has become their
largest nest. They keep a lot of treasure there that no other faction has
managed to claim yet.</p>

<p>Beneath even this, you get into tunnels that aren’t part of Gauntlgrym, and
which snake their way downwards to the Underdark. Whatever is down there is out
of scope of the campaign. It could perhaps be an interesting segue into Paragon
Tier when the PCs do finish it, should the group be willing.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>The areas detailed in this post have a definite “endgame” feeling. Whatever your
reasons for coming to Gauntlgrym, if you’re here you’ll need to deal with the
mess of adversarial factions described in this post, finish what Drizzt and
company could not, and make sure Maegera stays asleep.</p>

<p>This would be a fitting end to a campaign centered on the Heirs of Delzoun, but
others might go from here to the bottom of the Chasm as they follow the clues
left by the mind flayers to their real masters.</p>

<p>Conversely, if the group doesn’t include any heirs or anyone else who’d be
interested in the lost city, Gauntlgrym can be safely and entirely removed from
the campaign. Just say that Maegera is in no danger of waking up, and focus on
those elements that are relevant to your players.</p>

            <p>This part gives an overview of the fabled lost city of Gauntlgrym,and goes into
detail about its “upper” strata.</p>

<h2 id="historical-errata">Historical Errata</h2>

<p>There’s another bit I missed when I glossed over the big-ass timeline at the
beginning of the book, and now I must correct that here.</p>

<p>The dwarves of Gauntlgrym found the primordial Maegera early in their habitation
of the city, but they left her sealed up for a few hundred years before messing
with her.</p>

<p>The massive project that bound her into a sort of arcane power generator was a
three-way joint project between the dwarves, the mages of Illusk and the elves
of Iliyanbruen. As we saw in the post about Shandarar, they were still around
for a few centuries after the fall of Netheril, so they took part in this as
well. The book describes this as a positive example of what the three peoples
can do when they work together, though it outlived their friendship.</p>

<p>Maegera’s power allowed the dwarves of Delzoun to create inumerable wonders, in
the form of both potent magical items and marvelous works of infrastructure for
their capital and their empire. Gauntlgrym became a big center of trade and even
saw numerous human families moving there.</p>

<p>The reason it fell was because of the Orc Marches, a massive region-wide
invasion by an army of orcs larger than any seen before or since. By the time
this happened, the three peoples were no longer on speaking terms, as each had
grown more arrogant and mistrustful over time. They could have banded together
to repel the invasion, but each thought they could go it alone. Illusk fell
first, and Delzoun was next, and only at the gates of Shandarar was the
already-weakened orc army repelled.</p>

<p>Iliyanbruen would end up dismantling anyway when it tried to take the fight to
the orcs in Illusk, as we saw earlier. Gauntlgrym was left alone since no one
seemed to be coming up from there. Its dwarven and humans refugees scattered all
over the Realms, with many of the humans joining Uthgardt tribes on the surface
and the dwarves ranging out further to move to their surviving nations.</p>

<p>The empire of Delzoun and its capital of Gauntlgrym are today kinda like the
dwarven equivalent of the Roman Empire in that stupid meme. No dwarf living
today has ever laid eyes on the lost city, but they think of it regularly and
describe it as the height of their civilization.</p>

<h2 id="gauntlgrym-today">Gauntlgrym Today</h2>

<p>Despite being lost to the surface, Gauntlgrym did not remain static in all these
millennia. The orcs were kicked out by mind flayers; the mind flayers by derro;
and the derro by duergar. That last one happened fairly recently in historical
terms, so the duergar still consider themselves masters of the place. However,
they are not the only people living there. There are other groups seeking to
control the city, and literal multitudes of ghosts belonging to its original
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the city from the outside in.</p>

<h3 id="the-great-cavern">The Great Cavern</h3>

<p>Whatever paths to Gauntlgrym exist in your campaign, they will always end
here. This is a massive natural cavern filled with alien Underdark vegetation
and labyrinthine formations of stone pillars and stalagmites. Small forts and
balconies are carved into the walls and around the largest pillars - the remains
of former guard posts. The bones of ancient battles litter the floor.</p>

<p>There’s a small lake at the center of the cave, and on one of its walls stands
the massive mithral gate that leads into Gauntlgrym proper. It’s nearly
impossible to open by mundane or magical means, but a true heir of Delzoun can
open it with the slightest push. The cave is filled with your preferred
selection of Underdark monsters, and also with two sapient factions.</p>

<p>The first is a group of old Ashmadai who came here with Valindra when she first
tried to free the primordial in that Drizzt novel. The tunnels they used filled
with magma at the end of that, so they became trapped here. Their first reaction
to any strangers they spot is violence, though some of them might be prepared to
surrender or betray the rest in exchange for a way back to the surface.</p>

<p>The second faction is the House Xorlarrin expedition, who arrived recently and
built a hidden camp. They’re spying on the Ashmadai while looking for a way to
open the gates. Their reaction to intruding PCs will be to remain hidden and spy
on them as well, waiting to see if they can open the gates. If they can, the
drow will follow them covertly, scattering if spotted, and will only attack if
the PCs become distracted by some other enemy inside the city.</p>

<h3 id="the-iron-tabernacle">The Iron Tabernacle</h3>

<p>The Iron Tabernacle was Gauntlgrym’s temple district, and was both the city’s
physical and spiritual center. Its many temples and shrines were dedicated to
Moradin and other good gods, and attended by a sizable contingent of dwarven and
human priests. This enormous multi-leveled district was a marvelous sight to
behold in its glory days, but now most of it lies ravaged by both time and by
duergar impiety. The city’s new occupants have defaced every religious image and
statue they could find, and stolen anything of value here, from precious relics
to the mithral trim in the walls.</p>

<p>Still, the Tabernacle is so vast that some hidden shrines remain untouched and
could be reconsecrated by PCs. There’s a text box here detailing the minor boons
they can gain from doing so. An extended rest next to the restored shrine takes
only three hours instead of six, and has no danger of being interrupted by
wandering monsters. And if a member of the party is a non-evil dwarf or a
worshiper of Moradin, they might gain the attention of one of the city’s ghosts,
who will help them in battle the next time they fight (using a level-appropriate
incorporeal undead stat block). Both benefits only happen once.</p>

<p>The Tabernacle is also the hub of Gaunglgrym’s ancient mine rail network. The
rails connect directly or indirectly to every other district in the city, and
are meant to be traveled by self-propelled mine carts that were used for bulk
cargo transport back in the day. They still run according to their ancient
schedules and could be commandeered by PCs. A big switching station in the
Tabernacle can let them switch carts from one track to another. It’s an easy
way to get around this vast city.</p>

<p>Or perhaps not so easy - there are some rules here that might come into play
when a fight happens during a cart ride, or when a cart <em>derails</em> during a
fight.</p>

<h3 id="ancient-cemetery">Ancient Cemetery</h3>

<p>The lowest level of the Tabernacle is a massive collection of crypts, laid out
according to a now forgotten scheme or tradition. Some are simple, some very
elaborate, but all of them have the names, titles, and lineage of their
occupants carved on their stone.</p>

<p>Unlike the upper levels, the crypts are intact. The many, many ghosts who roam
the place attack any would-be vandals and thieves en masse, so the duergar stay
away from here.</p>

<p>The ghosts will not bother the PCs at first, but will attack as above if they
try to damage or steal from the crypts. The group should take care to remain on
their best behavior while in this area.</p>

<h2 id="theme-tie-ins-and-impressions">Theme Tie-Ins and Impressions</h2>

<p>The PC theme that’s most interested in Gauntlgrym is definitely the Heir of
Delzoun. Finding this place is their life’s goal, so if your party includes one
or more Heirs Gauntlgrym is going to be a vitally important place for the
campaign.</p>

<p>For the Heir and most other characters who might be interested in finding the
city, the true treasure here is all the historical and genealogical information
contained in the crypt walls. It’s a major archaeological finding all by itself,
which is reason enough for Oghma’s Faithful, but it’s even more valuable to the
Heir and perhaps even to the Neverwinter Noble. All dwarves, and a lot of human
nobles, keep pretty detailed genealogies of their own clans and families and
these would be easy to connect to the ones in display here.</p>

<p>If the Noble could prove that their house is older than Neverwinter itself, then
they might have an unassailable claim to the throne! And if the Heir’s ancestors
are important enough, they might have a strong claim to <em>Gauntlgrym’s</em> throne,
or perhaps to that of one of its successor states.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone would be happy with these findings. There are plenty of
dwarven nobles out there who built their prestige on forged lineages, and who
would not want the world to discover this fact. And many others who would be
more than happy to pull a Beloq and kill the PCs before they can announce their
findings to the world, so that they can claim the credit.</p>

<p>The “default” way to arrive at Gauntlgrym is to navigate the river of flame
beneath Mount Hotenow, but there could be other paths as well. Maybe they could
take a detour through Hotenow’s Shadowfell reflection, or maybe there’s a
mystical path similar to Shadowfell Road that takes those who follow it properly
to the mithral gates.</p>

<p>In the next post, we dig too greedily and too deep.</p>

<p>The Coiled Spring is an amulet made of brass. It’s disc shaped and about an inch
thick. On its front, there is a relief of a snake eating its own tail, the
classic Ouroboros. The inside of the ring formed by the snake is a clear crystal
panel, through which can be seen a spring like that of a watch.</p>

<p>That spring can store up to ten Fatigue Points which can be used to enable
bursts of extra effort - most often <em>Extra Effort in Combat</em> (p. B357), but also
other athletic feats. The stored FP can only be used for those purposes, and is
not affected by negative effects that would sap the user’s own FP. In other
words, it works just like the Heroic Reserves advantage from <strong>GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy 20: Slayers</strong>, and <em>almost</em> like a power item for martial characters.</p>

<p>The main difference between the Coiled Spring and a normal Power Item is that it
hijacks the natural recovery processes of the wearer’s body in order to “wind”
itself, and cannot be recharged by the usual methods for power items. While the
Spring is not at full capacity, its wearer is unable to recover their own
Fatigue Points, and the amulet gains 1 FP every 10 minutes. This is a constant
rate - traits which speed up FP recovery for the wearer have no effect on the
amulet. The wearer regains their usual ability to rest when the amulet is fully
charged, or when it’s removed (which stops the charging process).</p>

<p>While this does mean recharging the Coiled Spring in town is effectively free,
it can make dungeon delving more complicated for martial characters,
particularly if the GM enforces rules like fatigue costs for fighting a battle
(p. B426 or DF Exploits p. 60). Characters who normally can’t use Fatigue Points
can wear the Coiled Spring and use it to benefit from the Extra Effort rules in
and out of combat, though they can’t recharge it.</p>

<p>Scholars who know of the Spring speculate that it was originally meant  to allow
golems and other constructs to surpass their limits. In an adventure, it will
most likely be found worn by such a construct, or by an elite warrior who
figured out it works just as well for organics. If found in a chest or hoard,
though, it will always start out empty.</p>

<p>If the delvers try to sell the Coiled Spring, or if you decide it’s available in
shops, its monetary value is twice that of a Power Item of the same
capacity. That’s $3400 for the 10 FP version described here, though you could
have versions with greater or smaller capacity. Note that you <em>can’t</em> double-dip
and use the Coiled Spring as a Power Item.</p>

<p>Variant Springs are possible. Maybe the Flywheel of Faith can power divine
magic, the Arcane Array wizardly spells, and the Goddess Gyre druidic ones. The
recharging mechanics and all other restrictions are the same. They could allow a
construct who can’t normally cast spells or use casting magical items due to a
lack of FP to do so.</p>

<p>Whether called a hacker, a decker, or a netrunner, the person who invades
computer systems and makes them do things features prominently in the stories
most cyberpunk RPGs take inspiration from, and so often ends up being a vitally
important archetype in those games. However, they tend to have a very mixed
track record when it comes to actually presenting you with a hacking system
that’s fun and bug-free.</p>

<p>This means there are many possible reasons for why you might find yourself
planning a cyberpunk game but have no cause or wish to use its hacking
rules. Maybe none of the players wants to be a hacker, or maybe the group just
doesn’t like the rules of the game in question. In those cases, a popular
suggestion is to include a NPC hacker, and in this post we’ll discuss a way to
do so that keeps the rest of the group reasonably involved in the hacking. Rules
are for GURPS, but the concepts can be easily translated to other systems.</p>

<h2 id="work-from-home">Work From Home</h2>

<p>The current best practice in games that include hacker PCs is to devise ways to
keep the hacker together with the rest of the party, so that they can fully
participate in the game even when it’s not hacking time. When your group’s
hacker is an NPC, however, the best thing to do is the opposite. Hacker NPCs
should always do their thing remotely.</p>

<p>Managing NPCs who constantly accompany the party is a tricky affair. A character
who’s much weaker than the party runs the risk of turning the adventure into a
video-game-style escort quest, one of the most reviled types of mission in
existence. One who is strong enough to protect themselves can end up becoming a
GMPC, a label reserved for annoying characters who overshadow the players and
make them feel like the support cast of someone else’s story.</p>

<p>All of this is subjective, which makes it even trickier. Your group’s fun will
be hurt if they <em>feel</em> either of those scenarios is happening, even if the math
is well-balanced.</p>

<p>A remote hacker removes most of the risk. They’re in communication with the
group, and they can do the jobs covered by their niche, but any other challenge
that can be handled by the PC’s own skills <em>should</em> be, even if it’s
technological in nature. And there are things the hacker can only do with
on-site support from the PCs, which keeps them involved in the actual hack even
if you’re not engaging with those rules.</p>

<p>The exact nature of these support tasks depends on how your specific setting
handles computers and hacking. Most games either go the same Retro way of early
Shadowrun and CP2020, or a more “Modern” way that uses more recent tropes such
as the ones employed by Shadowrun 4th Edition or CP2077. We’ll look at how you
can accommodate a remote NPC hacker in both.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-another-timeline">The Future of Another Timeline</h2>

<p>It’s not immediately obvious to us here in 2023, but the earliest iterations of
Shadowrun’s Matrix and CP2020’s NET were based on a pre-Internet model of
networked computing. Strip all the futuristic terms from their description and
you’ll find out you’re dealing with 80s mainframes. This lies at the root of a
lot of things there that can look a bit weird or silly to modern
readers<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Here’s a short and approximately correct explanation for how that
works:</p>

<p>Mainframes are huge (and hugely expensive) computers that are usually
responsible for handling all data processing for an entire company or
organization. They were the dominant form of institutional computing from around
the 1950s to at least the early 1990s, and never really went away.</p>

<p>A mainframe is operated through remote terminals, which can be in the same
building or even off-site. Therefore, it must be ready to receive connections
and requests from these terminals. And the way you do that in the 80s is through
phone lines and modems. They do have <em>internal</em> security measures to
authenticate users and prevent one user from seeing or changing other users’
data, but there is no such thing as a firewall because permanent Internet
connections are not yet a thing for mainframes. The most security you can add to
the connection step is to keep the numbers for your mainframe’s phone lines
unlisted<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>And this is why both Shadowrun’s and CP2020’s descriptions of their “global
nets” are so concerned about splitting them into geographical regions and
assigning codes to them and the servers within them. That net is not the
<em>Internet</em>, but a world-spanning phone circuit. The first step to hacking
into that corporate mainframe is to dial the unlisted number of its modem<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="old-school-remote-hacking">Old-School Remote Hacking</h3>

<p>When you have a PC hacker in these more “retro” games, the number of the
target’s modem line might be included with the mission briefing, letting them
hack removely. It’s more likely that no number is included, then the hacker has
to go in with the group and find an terminal in the target facility through
which they could connect.</p>

<p>With a hacker NPC and they have the number, the reason the adventure is
happening at all is because the mission objectives have a physical component
that must happen at the same time. The typical setup is that you need to steal
the physical prototype while the hacker grabs the research files.</p>

<p>If they don’t have the number, then <em>discovering</em> the number becomes one of the
physical mission objectives! The place the PCs are infiltrating might not even
have any direct relation to the real, final objective, but it could be a place
that also uses the same mainframe remotely. The number is going to be written
down somewhere in there, either in an official manual, some employee’s personal
notes or even a scrap of paper that was carelessly thrown away<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. Some
non-VR-dungeon hacking of a physical terminal to peek at its configuration might
be necessary, which might be resolved by a couple of rolls since dumb terminals
are less secure than the mainframe they talk to. Or you might need to find a way
to scam the info out of an someone who works there (“social engineering”).</p>

<p>This fact-finding expedition could be a whole adventure in itself, or it might
just be an intermediate step in a more complex operation where the group must
also infiltrate the final target facility at the same time as the hacker does
their thing, as outlined above.</p>

<h2 id="twenty-minutes-from-now">Twenty Minutes From Now</h2>

<p>More recent cyberpunk games tend to base their networks on the real-world
Internet and the technologies that support it. This means that every individual
device attached to a network is effectively a full-feature computer, be it an
employee’s workstation, a security camera, or a guard’s smartphone. Different
departments have their own private servers and their own internal network that
doesn’t necessarily connect to the others or to the outside world.</p>

<p>Less sensitive facilities might allow employees to work remotely from their
homes or from other buildings by letting them connect via <em>virtual private
networks</em>. These connections to happen over the Internet, but they’re encrypted
and protected from general snooping. Realistically, our dastardly hacker would
need to steal valid credentials to be able to access a VPN.</p>

<p>On the other extreme, a top-secret secure facility might be <em>air-gapped</em>, which
means it’s isolated and sealed in such a way that no signal can enter or leave
the building. None of its internal networks are connected to the outside world,
and they are not connected to each other either unless this is absolutely
necessary. The servers controlling the security system are isolated from the
servers housing sensitive data. Each has its own independent set of protections.</p>

<p>This is both realistic according to our contemporary understanding of network
security, and an excellent way to make sure PC hackers stick with the group and
have plenty to do once inside. Individual hacking attempts tend to be shorter
but more numerous, and made against devices that are within the hacker’s
immediate reach<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. Shadowrun 4th Edition goes deep into this (5th and onwards
go back to the retro model), and it’s also more or less how things work in
Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

<h3 id="new-school-remote-hacking">New-School Remote Hacking</h3>

<p>In an environment so full of incentives for the hacker to stick with the party,
how can you accommodate a remote NPC hacker?</p>

<p>If the target facility has a VPN that contains the data you want, then many of
the same “classic” techniques for acquiring those old-school mainframe phone
numbers might also work to acquire valid VPN credentials, allowing the NPC to
hack the place remotely.</p>

<p>If it doesn’t have a VPN or is completely isolated, then we need to resort to
quantum bullshit. Below we’ll see GURPS stats for the bullshit in question,
imported directly from Warframe. It’s easily usable in other systems, though.</p>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/CorpusDatamass.webp" width=200/>
  <figcaption>A datamass.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A <strong>datamass</strong> is a device similar in concept to the causality communicator in
Ultra-Tech page 45, but <em>much</em> cheaper. It consists of an armored,
briefcase-sized device that incorporates several kinds of data cable plus laser
and IR micro-communicators and a small radio (GURPS Ultratech pages 43-44). All
of these are connected to a sizable amount of quantum-entangled matter.</p>

<p>Datamasses are made in entangled pairs that allow high-bandwidth communication
and data transfer between elements of the pair through any amount of barriers or
interference. They have DR 10, HP 8, cost $5000 for the pair, weight 5kg (10 lb)
each, and are LC1 (AKA <em>super illegal</em>). They also include an emergency
self-destruct switch that melts the internals of both elements of the pair and
can be triggered from either side.</p>

<p>In your typical cyberpunk setting, datamasses were first invented as
super-secret espionage tools by a major government or computer-focused megacorp,
and initially gave them a major leg up in one of the many ongoing cold wars
between such entities. The secret of their existence soon leaked, however, and
an enterprising independent engineer figured out they were quite easy to make
with a properly modified home 3d printer. Yes, even the entangled matter. The
plans for a home-baked datamasses were soon made widely available on the Net,
and they keep popping up no matter how much effort the corps spend to squash
them. That’s why they’re relatively cheap.</p>

<p>Datamass technology is going to be really revolutionary when FTL travel is
invented in the distant future, but for now it’s mostly used for its original
purpose, and allows teams of plucky street mercs like the PCs to operate at the
same level as crack corporate commandos when it comes to high-level
espionage. If the PCs are hired to do a hacking mission, they will usually be
provided a datamass pair. PCs can also buy their own through the usual illegal
channels available to PCs in these games. It should be difficult, but not
impossible.</p>

<p>In a setting that has datamasses, hacking missions look a lot like the Warframe
“mobile defense” missions these devices come from. The PCs need to sneak into
the target facility carrying a datamass, and find a place where to connect it. A
direct cable connection to a machine in the target network is best. A wi-fi
connection will do in a pinch, but will make everything that follows take
longer.</p>

<p>Since the hacker is an NPC, you don’t need to roll anything for the actual
hack - you just need to give the PCs a time frame for when it will be done. And
then they must stay near the datamass and guard it until that much time has
elapsed. If they snuck in, they need to find a way to maintain stealth and
divert security attention from their access point. If they’re found out, it
turns into a fight, but they still must stay until the hack is done or it will
fail. For added Fun(TM), a difficult mission might require the party to do this
several times from different access points.</p>

<p>The self-destruct switch is useful for when the hack is done, as it allows the
party to leave without having to lug the datamass back out. It can also prevent
the hacker from being traced if the device is captured. Or it can be used in a
double-cross that leaves the team stranded in enemy territory without network
support. Use that last one sparingly!</p>
