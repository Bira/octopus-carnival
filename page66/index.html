            <p><strong>Update</strong>: This is the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy version of the character. If you
want to see a version for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG, click <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/10/10/pathfinder-dfrpg-druid.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder’s Iconic Characters to
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy!</strong> This is the fourth post in the series. Previous
entriers can be found here:</p>

</ul>

<p>Today’s template is the Druid, which means today’s star is Lini. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Lini.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can find her full bio <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Lini">here</a>, and her original Pathfinder
stats <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/lini.html">here</a>. From looking at these, we see the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lini is a Golarion gnome, which is different from the Dungeon Fantasy gnome.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is a druid and hails from the Land of the Linnorm Kings, home of the
Not-Vikings. She was always good with animals, and left the place shortly
after meeting her snow leopard animal companion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wields a sickle and a sling, but prefers to send her animal companion to
fight for her. Her magic is more or less even mix of terrain-affecting,
support and attack spells. She is also described as having a knack for
handling animals, particularly large mammals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Template-wise, the default <strong>Druid</strong> will be appropriate here, as Pathfinder
druids draw their power directly from nature. The biggest difficulty will be
Lini’s racial template, as gnomes from Golarion (Pathfinder’s setting) are
different from those presented in DF. So the first order of business here is
creating a racial template for the Golarion Gnome.</p>

<p>From the point of view of Dungeon Fantasy, the gnomes of Golarion are more like
slightly larger leprechauns than the gadget-oriented folk you see in
DF 3. They’re about the size of halflings, and while the original system does
give them a small bonus to crafting skills, their innate magic and faerie
heritage are more emphasized. I also want to keep the template cost at or under
20 points, since that’s what DF gnomes cost. Putting all of that together we
have something like this:</p>

<h2 id="golarion-gnomes-0-points">Golarion Gnomes (0 points)</h2>

<p><strong>Attribute Modifiers</strong>: ST-3 {-30}; HT+2 {20}.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Characteristic Modifiers</strong>: SM -2; HP+1 {2}; Will+1 {5}; Per +1 {5};

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Impulsiveness (12) {-10}</p>

<p>And now that we have all we need, here’s today’s character! Her spell repertoire
is a bit lighter on direct buffs than in Pathfinder, but still strikes the same
balance.</p>

<p>After covering occupational templates in some detail, it’s time to look at
racial templates. What options do players have for creating non-human
characters?</p>

<p>The default answer is “not many”. The original game started out with a more
traditional fantasy setting containing all the races you’d expect, but was
eventually developed into the setting we see when playing it. <em>Humans</em> make up
the bulk of civilization in Gransys and the rest of the world. A minority of
alien <em>Pawns</em> are the only non-humans who are also part of it.</p>

<p>There are other non-human sapients around: <em>Goblins</em> and their <em>Hobgoblin</em>
cousins clearly have a civilization of sorts, and the various species of
<em>Saurian</em> (humanoid lizards) are fairly sophisticated tool-users. However, their
views of humanity run between “fun to torment” and “tasty”, with humans holding
an equivalent low opinion off them. Peaceful interaction between these species
is vanishingly rare. Other sapient monsters (such as the <em>Harpy</em> and <em>Dragon</em>
families) are even less appropriate as player characters! These will all be
covered when we get to the monsters.</p>

<p>Below you will find two racial lenses for the Arisen and the Pawns. These can be
used as-is in the Dragon’s Dogma setting presented in this blog, or in a more
traditional DF setting if the GM is willing to bring in the cosmic baggage that
comes with them. In those settings, the lenses can be applied to members of any
playable race, giving you characters such as elven Arisen or halfling Pawns.</p>

<p>But first, let’s briefly discuss a setting element tied to both of these lenses:</p>

<h2 id="setting-element-the-rift">Setting Element: The Rift</h2>

<p>The world of Dragon’s Dogma is touched by the Rift, an interstitial realm that
appears as a dimly lit, fog-covered plain. The Rift connects multiple worlds,
and is the original home of the Pawns. The Dragon comes from somewhere beyond
it. The points where it touches the world are marked by <em>Riftstones</em>, and the
Arisen can use those to interact with the Rift.</p>

<p>We’ll reveal much more about it in future posts, but for now it’s enough to know
that the existence of the two racial lenses shown below in a setting also
implies that it’s touched by the Rift and contains Riftstones. GMs using
different settings that already possess similar “planar travel” elements might
want to use those instead, or to integrate the Rift with them.</p>

<h2 id="the-arisen-10-points">The Arisen (10 points)</h2>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/arisen-party.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>Copyright 2013 Capcom</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Arisen are those who dare stand against the Dragon when it first enters the
world. For this, they are marked in a mystical ritual where the Dragon consumes
their heart. The stolen heart still beats within the beast, and so the victim
rises again compelled to confront it once more.</p>

<p>Having no heart, the Arisen also have no pulse or heartbeat. The ritual also
leaves a very large and distinctive scar in their chests, which is the same
shape for all of them. This scar can be covered up fairly easily, but it
sometimes glows through any clothing or armor when in proximity to a Pawn or a
draconic being. The Arisen also have the ability to interact with the Rift by
touching a Riftstone. By doing this they are able to draw forth specific Pawns
from the Rift itself and the worlds beyond.</p>

<p>They are widely respected in any society that is aware of their existence, but
that comes at the cost of being expected to confront the Dragon. Jealous or
snobbish nobles also like to impose “tests of skill” to Arisen characters so
they might prove they are “worthy” of the station.</p>

<p>The Arisen are portrayed as being unusually capable in the original games,
though it is unclear if this comes from their condition or if they were chosen
for being heroic in the first pĺace. Either way, Arisen PCs shouldn’t be built
on less than 250 points.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the ability to drawn Pawns forth from the Rift is a
0-point feature. At most it’s a way of acquiring an Ally (see Arisen Power-Ups
below), but usually it’s just fancier dressing for the usual Search rolls to
find and hire henchmen.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Injury Tolerance: No Vitals (Heart only, -50%) {3}<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>; Hero 2
{10};</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Unnatural Features (No heartbeat, occasionally glowing scar)
{-3}<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>;</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>: Unaging<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>; Can interact with the Rift through Riftstones.</p>

<h3 id="arisen-npcs">Arisen NPCs</h3>

<p>The Dragon usually only creates one Arisen per incursion, but it’s definitely
possible for more than one to exist at the same time. Even if the party already
includes an Arisen PC they might find others who are still hanging around from
previous draconic invasions. Their attitudes towards a PC Arisen will vary
greatly.</p>

<h3 id="arisen-pcs">Arisen PCs</h3>

<p>An Arisen PC will necessarily bring with it the narrative of the Dragon. It must
be addressed, even if it’s just a sentence in the character’s back story
explaining how they avoided the confrontation. If it’s publicly known that the
character avoided their “fate”, the positive reputation implied by the Hero
advantage can be replaced by a negative reputation for cowardice or laziness
instead, giving everyone a -2 Reaction and worth -10 points. Simply removing the
Hero advantage brings the cost of the lens down to 0 points. Adding the negative
Reputation makes it cost -10 points in total.</p>

<p>There’s nothing preventing multiple Arisen PCs from being on the same party!
Some of them might be old Arisen created in a previous invasion, or the Dragon
might just have decided to be more prolific this time around. It’s not like
anyone can stop it from performing the ritual multiple times.</p>

<h3 id="arisen-power-ups">Arisen Power-Ups</h3>

<p>Most Arisen tend to acquire the company of an extremely loyal Pawn shortly after
being marked, known as their Main Pawn. If this Pawn is an NPC, then it can be
bought as an Ally (100% of points, Available Constantly) {20}.</p>

<p>And while not technically a “power-up”, killing the Dragon removes the Arisen
lens from all of the Arisen it ever created, returning the hearts it retains to
their owners. Such characters retain the loyalty of their Main Pawns and the
respect of the rest of the Legion, but become normal members of their base races
and <em>immediately age to their natural age</em>. This <em>can</em> cause an ancient Arisen
to crumble to dust on the spot, and it’s the main reason why these might be
hostile towards their younger “siblings”.</p>

<p>Any world subject to the cycle of draconic invasion is riddled with rifts that
open to a foggy place beyond it. From these rifts comes the Pawn Legion,
familiar yet alien.</p>

<p>Pawns, also known as “Myrmidons”, have no childhood, and no parents. They spring
fully grown from the stuff of the Rift. Some are created by an Arisen, others
seem to be spontaneously generated, and some are brought over from other
worlds. Despite this artificial origin, they are very similar to humans
physiologically and still need to eat, drink and sleep as normal. All have a
“birthmark” of sorts in the palm of their right hands, shaped like an Arisen’s
scar and known as the “pawnprint”. This mark sometimes glows when in the
presence of an Arisen.</p>

<p>The main difference between a human and a Myrmidon is psychological. From a
human’s point of view, Pawns have a cold and detached demeanor that makes them
hard to relate to. They do have emotions and the ability to display them, but
the way they do so feels “off” in way that’s hard to describe. They also seem to
have a problem displaying significant personal initiative, which is why most of
them make a living as errant mercenaries, singly or in small groups. Unlike most
standard fantasy races, the average Myrmidon is an adventurer. It’s the
“civilians” who are the rare exceptions. Regardless of their profession, all
Pawns consider themselves to be members of the “Pawn Legion”, and never fight
each other.</p>

<p>Pawns directly created by an Arisen are unflinchingly loyal to their creator,
and all Pawns are predisposed to respect any Arisen they meet. They are unaging
and have very long memories. Those who feel particularly well-disposed towards
their master or employer might offer a constant stream of advice drawn from
these memories in an attempt to be more helpful. Fortunately, they can learn to
tone it down.</p>

<p>When a Pawn is killed, their body dematerializes. They can be drawn back to life
from the Rift by an Arisen. This weakens the Pawn’s metaphysical cohesion, so it
can only be done a limited number of times before that individual is lost
forever.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Eidetic Memory {5}; Extra Life (Requires an Arisen and a
Riftstone, -40%) {15}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Hidebound {-5}; Low Empathy {-20}; Social Stigma (Minority
Group) {-10}.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>: Unaging<sup id="fnref:3:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>; Reacts at +2 to Arisen; Cannot be resurrected by any
other means.</p>

<h3 id="pawn-npcs">Pawn NPCs</h3>

<p>In the original game, all Pawns are AI-controlled characters, and their
psychological traits as described above are a justification for their in-game
behavior. It’s similarly easy to make them NPCs in a tabletop campaign: any
sufficiently-sized city will have a small contingent of Pawns ready to act as
hirelings for an adventuring party. They’re a little cheaper than equivalent
human help, which compensates for the increased supervision their lack of
flexibility requires. Like any hireling, they will refuse to work for a party
who purposefully endangers or mistreats them! Word gets around, even among
Pawns.</p>

<h3 id="pawn-pcs">Pawn PCs</h3>

<p>PCs can choose to play a Pawn as well. In that case, simply use the racial
template above with the same type of template used by the other PCs in the
campaign. If another PC is an Arisen, then the Pawn PC will likely be their Main
Pawn, and should have a Sense of Duty towards the PC.</p>

<p>If no other PC is an Arisen but someone still wants to play a Pawn, it’s
recommended that the GM either change the limitations on the character’s Extra
Life or include an NPC Arisen who might perform the service of restoring the
dead Pawn. If neither appeal, feel free to delete this advantage and the
resurrection-related feature from the racial lens, making it worth -30
points.</p>

<h3 id="pawn-power-ups">Pawn Power-Ups</h3>

<p>Pawns who serve an Arisen for a long time or who develop strong relationships
with other non-Pawns might find their own souls strengthened by these
bonds. They may buy more instances of Extra Life for 15 points each, and Special
Rapport with their Arisen creator for 5 points. Additionally, they may buy off
the Low Empathy and Hidebound disadvantages from the lens. Extraordinary
circumstances might allow a Myrmidon to buy off the entire lens and become a
full member of their base race.</p>

<p>This is the second of the two Dragon’s Dogma-specific character templates I
promised. Like the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/19/characters-magic-archer.html">Magic Archer</a>, it’s a 250-point template suitable for a
Dungeon Fantasy campaign, with additional notes on how they fit into the
Dragon’s Dogma campaign setting.</p>

<p>Note that this is not the same as the template presented in <strong>Pyramid
#3/13</strong>, despite having the same name. As explained <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/18/characters-part-3.html">earlier</a>, I’m staying
away from Imbuements in this setting. Of course, if you like the Pyramid Mystic
Knight better, don’t hesitate to use it instead! And if you want to use both
templates in the same game, please feel free to rename this one.</p>

<h2 id="the-mystic-knight">The Mystic Knight</h2>

<p>You are a master of war, equally versed in the arts of melee combat and
battlefield magic. Unlike the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/19/characters-magic-archer.html">Magic Archer</a> you like to be right in the
middle of the fight, though you prefer to make the enemy come to you rather than
charge blindly into the fray. You fight like a knight (<strong>DF 1</strong>, p. 10) but can
also handle trickier foes with your wizardly spells.</p>

<p><strong>Attributes</strong>: ST 13 {30}; DX 13 {60}; IQ 12 {40}; HT 13 {30}.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Characteristics</strong>: Damage 1d/2d-1; BL 16.9kg (17 lbs); HP 13; Will

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Born War Leader 1 {5}; Magery 3 {35}; Weapon Channeling

<p><strong>Primary Skills</strong>: Hidden Lore (Demons, Magical Items, Magical Writings,

</ol>

<p><strong>Secondary Skills</strong>: Armoury (Body Armor <em>or</em> Melee Weapons) and Connoisseur

{4}-14; Leadership (A) IQ {1}<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">4</a></sup>-12; <em>and</em> Strategy and Tactics, both (H) IQ+1

<p><strong>Spells</strong>: Spend 20 points on wizardly spells, which start at either (H) IQ+1
{1}-13 or (VH) IQ {1}-12 with the +3 from Magery. Alternatively, spend some of
those points in additional Archmagic abilities.</p>

<h3 id="customization-notes">Customization Notes.</h3>

<p>Much of the variation in this template comes from weapon and spell choice. All
Mystic Knights favor either spells that enhance their own abilities and weapons
(such as Flaming Weapon and Flaming Armor), deliver DR-ignoring damage that they
can channel through their weapons or shields (such as Shocking Touch or Death
Touch), or cause damage over an area that doesn’t depend on resistance
rolls. Spells such as Affect Spirits also come in handy for insubstantial foes.</p>

<p>Mystic Knights who favor their spells should increase either IQ or Magery with
discretionary advantage points. They might also wish to spend 10 of their points
reserved for spells in an additional level of Magery. Adding an Energy Reserve
or extra FP is always useful, as well. Those who wish to emphasize their martial
side should increase DX or ST, or perhaps invest in more Born War Leader
talent. And in all cases, spending some of the points earned from quirks in
extra starting cash for armor and weapons is advisable.</p>

<p>Beyond that they can be knightly paragons (Honesty, Sense of Duty), dastardly
brigands (Greed, Callous, Bully), slightly odd from their study of magic
(Unnatural Features, Pyromania, Weirdness Magnet), or a combination of these.</p>

<h3 id="mystic-knight-power-ups">Mystic Knight Power-Ups</h3>

<p>Mystic Knights may spend extra points in spells and in anything on their
template, plus these options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Magery up to 6 {10/level}.</li>
  <li>Born War Leader up to 6 {5/level}.</li>
  <li>Any Archmagic abilities.</li>
  <li>Enhanced Block up to 2 {5/level}.</li>
  <li>Enhanced Parry (one Melee Weapon skill) up to 2 {5/level}.</li>
  <li>Extra Attack 1 {25}.</li>
  <li>The Armor Mastery and Shield Mastery power-ups found in <strong>DF 11</strong> p. 29.</li>
  <li>Weapon Master (Single Weapon) or Weapon Master (Weapon and Shield) {20 or 25}.</li>
</ul>

<p>As their base skill level with wizardly spells is kind of low compared to that
of a full caster, all Mystic Knights can benefit from more Magery, from an
Energy Reserve, or increased FP (which also helps with combat maneuvers).</p>

<h3 id="mystic-knights-in-gransys">Mystic Knights in Gransys</h3>

<p>Mystic Knights are more common in Gransys and neighboring nations than Magic
Archers, especially among actual knights, as the physical component of their
fighting style is already popular with that crowd. They remain relatively rare
when compared to their non-magical cousins, though.</p>

<p>Like pure Knights, they have access to Status 1 or 2 in campaigns where that
matters. And since all magic in Gransys is wizardly in nature the Social Stigma
(Excommunicated) advantage is worth only -5 points.</p>

<h2 id="new-perks">New Perks</h2>

<h3 id="weapon-channeling">Weapon Channeling</h3>

<p>Normally, the Staff enchantment doesn’t work if applied to something other than
a wand or staff. With this perk, available only to Mystic Knights, you become
able to use melee weapons and shields with the enchantment! You must still buy
or find items so enchanted. They can still be used to deliver touch and Melee
spells like standard Staffs. A block with a shield won’t trigger a held Melee
spell, but a shield bash or Beat with the shield will.</p>

<h2 id="new-spells">New Spells</h2>

<p>One of the signature Mystic Knight abilities in the original game is the power
to enchant all the party’s weapons with a given element at once, which saves a
lot of time when that element turns out to be required in the middle of a
fight. This is something can try replicating here by introducing a few new
spells.</p>

<p>These spells can be learned by any wizardly caster who meets the
prerequisites. They’re an efficient choice when the party is composed of two or
more adventurers who have the chance to cluster inside the affected area. GMs
worried about having their PCs waltzing into every fight with
elementally-charged weapons should disallow them!</p>

<h3 id="flame-trance-area">Flame Trance (Area)</h3>

<p>Adds the effect of either Flaming Weapon or Flaming Missiles on the melee and
missile weapons held by every person in the affected area.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Duration</em>: 1 minute.</li>
  <li><em>Base Cost</em>: 5. Cannot be maintained.</li>
  <li><em>Time to Cast</em>: 2 seconds.</li>
  <li><em>Prerequisites</em>: Magery 3 and Flaming Missiles.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="frost-trance-area">Frost Trance (Area)</h3>

<p>Like Flame Trance, but adds the effects of Icy Weapon and Icy Missiles as
appropriate.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Duration</em>: 1 minute.</li>
  <li><em>Base Cost</em>: 4. Cannot be maintained.</li>
  <li><em>Time to Cast</em>: 2 seconds.</li>
  <li><em>Prerequisites</em>: Magery 2 and Icy Missiles.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="lightning-trance-area">Lightning Trance (Area)</h3>

<p>Like Flame Trance, but adds the effects of Lightning Weapon or Lightning
Missiles as appropriate.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Duration</em>: 1 minute.</li>
  <li><em>Base Cost</em>: 5. Cannot be maintained.</li>
  <li><em>Time to Cast</em>: 3 seconds.</li>

<p>As promised, here is the first of the two entirely new templates related to
Dragon’s Dogma. The Magic Archer is meant to combine the archery prowess of a
Scout with the magic of the Wizard in a more balanced way than what is possible
by using “multiclass” lenses.</p>

<h2 id="the-magic-archer-250-points">The Magic Archer (250 points)</h2>

<p>You blend two tricky disciplines into an elegant, pointy whole. You’re almost as
good a shot as any Scout (<strong>DF 1</strong>, p. 10), but you chose to spend the rest of
your time learning the secrets of magic rather than getting lost in the
woods. You trade the Scout’s skill at wilderness survival for the ability to
deliver magical explosions at greater distances than the Wizard (<strong>DF 1</strong>,
p. 15).</p>

<p><strong>Attributes</strong>: ST 12 {20}; DX 13 {60}; IQ 13 {60}; HT 11 {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Characteristics</strong>: Damage 1d-1/1d+2; BL 29 lbs (14.4kg); HP 12 {0};

Magery. Some of them may be spent in Archmagic abilities instead.</p>

<h3 id="magic-archers-in-gransys">Magic Archers in Gransys</h3>

<p>Magic Archers are relatively rare in Gransys, as it takes a lot of work to get
this good with both a bow and magic. Noble scions are the ones most likely to
have the necessary time on their hands, though anyone who makes a living
fighting could also acquire the necessary training during their careers. This
includes both knights and bandits!</p>

<p>In campaigns where Status and social position matter, Magic Archers have access
to Status 1 or 2, like knights. And since all magic in Gransys is wizardly in
nature the Social Stigma (Excommunicated) advantage is worth only -5 points.</p>

<h3 id="customization-notes">Customization Notes</h3>

<p>The Magic Archer is about as specialized as the Scout, being built around the
Spell-Archery spell and its prerequisites. A wide spell selection allows for
plenty of diferentiation between characters, and several different avenues
present themselves.</p>

<p><em>Arcane Artillerists</em> blanket the battlefield witht their magic from afar. They
take extra Magery and/or a large Energy Reserve, go for Area spells, and make
frequent use of the fact that attacking an area rather than a person gives +4 to
skill.</p>

<p><em>Sorcerous Snipers</em> focus on eliminating high-value targets. They take Weapon
Master (Bow) to improve their base damage and chose single-target damaging touch
spells to increase it even further.</p>

<p><em>Archer-Commanders</em> go for Born War Leader and choose healing and support spells
to use on allies through boffer arrows (see the Cleric-Scout lens on <strong>DF 3</strong>,
p. 23 ). If using the template on a generic Dungeon Fantasy game, you could
replace Magery 3 {35} with Clerical Investment {5} and Power Investiture 3 {30}
on the template and add an apropriate required disadvantage to make it a Holy
Archer.</p>

<h3 id="magic-archer-power-ups">Magic Archer Power-Ups</h3>

<p>Magic Archers may spend earned points on extra spells and anything on their
template, plus these options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Magery up to 6 {10/level}.</li>
  <li>Any Archmagic abilities.</li>
  <li>Enhanced Tracking (Multiple Lock-Ons, +20%) {6/level}, with <em>no</em> upper
limit.</li>
  <li>Extra Attack 1 {25}.</li>
  <li>Zen Archery <em>without</em> needing Meditation.</li>
  <li>The Double-Shot (<strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 32), Quick-Shot (<strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 33) and
Strongbow (<strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 33) power-ups.</li>

<p>Now that we have a <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/17/characters-part-2.html">solid grasp of magic</a> in the world of Dragon’s Dogma, we
can finish our tour of its vocations and how they relate to the templates in
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>. The last big category we have yet to cover are Hybrid
Vocations, which I think are one of the most distinctive aspects of the original
game.</p>

<h2 id="hybrid-vocations-in-dragons-dogma">Hybrid Vocations in Dragon’s Dogma</h2>

<p>Dragon’s Dogma has three <em>hybrid vocations</em>, each of which combines aspects from
two of the color-coded categories we covered back in <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/13/characters.html">Part 1</a>. They are
covered here in a little more detail than the single-color vocations were,
because I feel it’s important to examine how their concepts are executed.</p>

<p>The Red/Yellow vocation is the <em>Assassin</em>. An Assassin can equip all basic “red”
and “yellow” weapons in any combination, which allows them to have a large
number of active special abilities accessible via the equipment menu. These
abilities tend to have involve high mobility and precision damage, with some use
of explosives. An Assassin is <em>versatile</em> and fights by choosing the best weapon
for each opponent and trying to kill them quickly before they can fight back.</p>

<p>The Yellow/Blue vocation is the <em>Magic Archer</em>. They can wear heavier armor than
a pure spellcaster, and since their arrows are made of magic they use no
ammunition. Their abilities add specific elemental and “trick” effects to their
arrows (bouncing on walls, explosions, and so on). They fight mostly by
remaining at range and hitting enemies on their <em>elemental vulnerabilities</em>.</p>

<p>The Red/Blue vocation is the <em>Mystic Knight</em>. Mystic Knights wear heavy armor
and wield one-handed swords or maces paired with large shields. Their abilities
allow them to reflect blocked damage back to the attacker, add elemental damage
to the whole party’s weapons at once, and place damaging mystical sigils on the
ground. They fight by <em>controlling the battlefield</em> and making sure the enemy
suffers for any decision they make.</p>

<h2 id="missing-templates">Missing Templates</h2>

<p>You might have been wondering how the two <strong>DF 1</strong> templates we haven’t
discussed yet fit into this. The short answer is they don’t.</p>

<p><em>Martial Artists</em> would seem like a good example of a Yellow/Blue template, as
they rely on agility and have access to supernatural powers. However, the
template as it stands is tied into the whole “kung-fu” aesthetic, which Dragon’s
Dogma doesn’t really go for. The “exotic but supremely skilled foreign
combatant” niche is better filled by a Swashbuckler wielding fencing weapons.</p>

<p><em>Holy Warriors</em> also seem like a good example of a Red/Blue template, but once
again the Holy Might power implies a strong connection to the divine that
doesn’t match the way magic works in this setting. Changing this template to
match Dragon’s Dogma magic would be more work than it was for the Cleric, and so
it’s better to drop it.</p>

<h2 id="hybrid-templates">Hybrid Templates</h2>

<p>How can we translate the feel of these vocations into Dungeon Fantasy templates?
The obvious way would be to resort to the Mixed Profession lenses from <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level</strong>. Aside from giving players the ability to
combine powers from multiple templates, they also feel like an “advanced option”
for characters with a some experience under their belts, just like their
counterparts in the original game.</p>

<p>The other option would be to create a character from the start using a template
that draws on multiple concepts to inform their abilities. We will also look at
those options here.</p>

<p>A good way to get a versatile, “Assassin”-like character is to add a <em>Scout</em>
lens to a character who started with either the Knight or Swashbuckler
template. Alternatively, you can add the <em>Swashbuckler</em> lens to a Scout, choosing
a melee weapon such as a broadsword. This will leave you with an agile character
who is equally adept at ranged and melee combat. A small investment in the
appropriate Fast-Draw specialties and the Quick-Sheathe perk can ensure you
always have the right weapon on hand.</p>

<p>For a “Magic Archer”-like character, adding the <em>Scout</em> lens to a spellcaster
certainly helps, but the most important bit is the <em>Spell-Archery</em> spell found
in both <strong>DF 3</strong> and <strong>DF 11</strong>. Doing it the other way around (Adding a Wizard
lens to a Scout) is somewhat less efficient but still possible.</p>

<p>Similarly, a “Mystic Knight”-like character could be approximated by either a
Knight with the <em>Wizard</em> lens or a Wizard with the <em>Knight</em> lens. A Cleric with
the <em>Knight</em> or <em>Swashbuckler</em> lens would also work and give us a more balanced
approach.</p>

<p>In both cases, the choices available feel somewhat unsatisfactory, as the end
result doesn’t strike a good enough balance between the physical and magical
sides of the concept.</p>

<p>As an aside, I’m aware that there’s a <em>Mystic Knight</em> template in <strong>Pyramid
#3/13</strong>. Despite the rather fortuitous naming coincidence, I chose not to
include it because it uses Imbuements. While I like the concept of Imbuements, I
don’t like the amount of rolls their implementation adds to the average fight.</p>

<h2 id="new-templates">New Templates!</h2>

<p>So it seems we have two vacancies in our template lineup with the removal of the
Holy Warrior and Martial Artist. Given that the “Mixed Professions” route for
creating a Magic Archer or a Mystic Knight leaves something to be desired, I
feel compelled to bring the number of available templates back to 11 by creating
two entirely new templates for those vocations. This will be the subject of my
next couple of posts.</p>
