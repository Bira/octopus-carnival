<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Kanks are giant, beetle-like hive insects. A wild hive will viciously attack
strangers and intruders, but they’re actually relatively easy to domesticate:
just start feeding them. After a while, the kanks will start seeing those who
bring them food as members of the hive.</p>

<p>Each hive has a queen that does little more than continuously lay eggs. The
larvae that hatch from these eggs can specialize in one of two ways:</p>

<p>Kank spitters are the hive’s workers. Their duty is to forage for any sort of
organic matter and process it into a nutritive nectar that is used to feed the
hive (and extracted to feed people). They can store the noxious byproducts of
this processing and spit them at intruders as a form of defense, hence their
name.</p>

<p>Kank soldiers are very straightforward: they’re big, they’re strong, they have
huge mandibles. Their duty is to protect spitters from threats. When properly
trained, they’re also extremely popular war mounts.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Kank queens are too immobile to get combat stats, but we do get stats for the
other two types. Both are Natural Beasts with a ground speed of 8 and Resist 5
Acid and Poison.</p>

<h3 id="kank-spitter">Kank Spitter</h3>

<p>Spitters are Small but not defenseless. They’re Level 2 Artillery with 30
HP. Their <strong>bites</strong> do a mix of untyped and acid damage. Their <strong>Kank Spit</strong> has
range 10. On a hit it does a little bit of physical damage, inflicts ongoing 5
acid damage, and slows (save ends). If the target was already slowed, it is
immobilized instead.</p>

<h3 id="kank-soldier">Kank Soldier</h3>

<p>These Large kanks are Level 4 Soldiers with 54 HP and the Mount tag. Their
<strong>bite</strong> is rather weak to start with, but it grabs on a hit. Once the soldier
has a grabbed victim, it can only bite that victim, but its bite attack gains +2
to attack and +10 to damage.</p>

<p>The soldier can instead choose to inject the victim with <strong>Kank Venom</strong>
(recharge 5+), an attack that targets Fortitude, slows, and deals ongoing 10
poison damage (save ends both). After the first saved throw, this worsens to
immobilized.</p>

<p>If serving as a mount, their benefit is <strong>Grabbed Advantage</strong>: this gives their
rider combat advantage against the kank’s grabbed victim.</p>

<p>Kank soldiers don’t have marking mechanics, but they don’t need them. They’ll
focus on a victim and try to keep it grabbed by their mandibles, using the venom
as a parting shot if they have reason to release the grab.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I keep hearing about kanks in other Dark Sun Let’s Reads, so it’s nice to
finally put a (bug) face to the name, so to speak. They feel more interesting to
me than crodlus, both because they’re beetles and because they have a use other
than “war mount” to their humanoid caretakers.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Described as “small, squat, and pugnacious”, these round boys are reptilian dog
equivalents with keen senses and a vicious streak. On the wild they follow your
standard pack hunter structure, but they’re also frequently “tamed” by people
for use as combat, guard, and tracker animals.</p>

<p>“Tamed” is in quotes here because jhakars don’t form bonds of loyalty with their
handlers. They respect strength and pain, but they also nurse grudges. So the
process of training a jhakar is quite cruel and results in a creature that’s
likely to turn on their handler as soon as it sees a chance. Ironically, because
of this owning a trained jhakar is seen as a sign of strength.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Jhakars are Small Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag. They have a ground speed
of 6 and Low-Light Vision. Their signature ability is <strong>Uncanny Senses</strong>, which
makes their attacks ignore concealment.</p>

<p>Jhakars don’t have supernatural tracking abilities like some of the monsters we
saw before, but you can probably consider them as good at it as a trained
mundane hound.</p>

<h3 id="jhakar-tracker">Jhakar Tracker</h3>

<p>This specimen is a Level 1 Skirmisher with 28 HP and all standard jhakar
traits. As mentioned above, it’s probably as good at tracking as a mundane dog,
but its stat block focuses more on what it does once it finds its prey.</p>

<p>The tracker’s <strong>bite</strong> does standard damage with a sizable bonus against targets
granting combat advantage to it. The attack also lets the tracker shift 1 square
as an effect.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the tracker can use an <strong>Opportunistic Chomp</strong> as a reaction
when an enemy ends its turn within 2 squares. It lets make a free bite attack
with the damage bonus.</p>

<p>Trackers are unlikely to stay in one place for very long. Their free shift with
a bite lets them move in, bite, and then dart away.</p>

<h3 id="jhakar-trapjaw">Jhakar Trapjaw</h3>

<p>This beefier specimen is a Level 3 Soldier with 47 HP. Its <strong>Bite</strong> is a bit
stronger, grabs on a hit, and lets the trapjaw make a secondary attack against
Fortitude. If that one hits, the grabbed victim takes 5 ongoing damage until
the grab ends.</p>

<p>The trapjaw can also <strong>Drag Down</strong> a grabbed victim, attacking their
Fortitude. If they hit, they deal heavy damage and knock the target prone. It
can’t get up until the grab ends either! This recharges when the creature is
first bloodied.</p>

<p>Unlike trackers, jhakar trapjaws are set up to choose a PC and make their day
extremely bad. They’ll do exactly that, positioning themselves as the center of
attention to let their quicker buddies attack the party while they’re
distracted. This works no matter who those allies are, so it’s appropriate for
both wild and domesticated jhakar.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>This entry is short and to the point, just like the creatures it
describes. You’ll never ever need to include normal dogs or wolves in our Dark
Sun Campaigns if this book has anything to say about it.</p>

<p>An encounter group of wild Jhakars will probably include one or two trapjaws
with trackers making up the rest of the numbers. And of course any of the other
doglike creatures in this or other books could be reskinned as a jhakar. They
also work in any mixed encounter as trained beasts, as they are fairly common in
that role.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Unlike most of the Athasian fauna we saw so far, these giant lizards are fairly
docile omnivores. They mostly eat plants and roots, though they’ll also feed on
carrion and small animals. They only attack people if directly
threatened.</p>

<p>Inixes are widely domesticated for use as mounts, draft animals, and
livestock. Some people like to keep juveniles as pets. In the wild, they roam in
small bands. Inix females lay eggs once a year, and are capable of producing
viable eggs even without a male.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Inixes are Natural Beasts, with the Reptile tag. When forced to fight they
attack with bites and with swipes of their large and powerful tails.</p>

<h3 id="inix-juvenile">Inix Juvenile</h3>

<p>Inix juveniles are only about half the size of adults, which means they’re
Medium. This slighter build makes them faster than adults. Juveniles also have
venom in their bites, which they lose as they grow up. They’re Level 4
Skirmishers with 57 HP and a speed of 8.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, their <strong>bite</strong> is venomous, dealing a mix of physical and
poison damage. As a minor action they can attempt a <strong>Tail Trip</strong>, which attacks
Fortitude. On a hit, the inix knocks the target prone and can shift 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="inix-adult">Inix Adult</h3>

<p>Adults are size Large, and Level 9 Brutes with 120 HP and a Speed of 6. They’ll
probably open the fight with a <strong>Tail Slap</strong> that attacks the Fortitude of
enemies in a Close Blast 2. On a hit it deals standard physical damage and
knocks the targets prone.</p>

<p>Next, it’s time for the <strong>bite</strong>, which deals standard physical damage. When it
hits a prone target, the bite deals extra damage and grabs that target. The
victim can only try to stand up after the grab ends, and the inix can keep
making bite attacks against it (but not against others while the victim remains
grabbed).</p>

<p>If the inix is serving as a mount, it can use the <strong>Warding Tail</strong> ability. This
triggers when the rider is hit by an opportunity attack provoked by making a
ranged or area attack, and lets the inix use Tail Slap against the triggering
creature as a free action. This makes them a fine mount for artillery monsters!</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>A short and sweet entry. It’s always good to see another member of the club of
Athasian creatures that are not suicidally aggressive predators.</p>

<p>Encounters with domesticated inixes tend to be much more interesting than those
with wild ones, as they can feature more varied encounter groups. As mentioned
above, adults are awesome mounts for artillery and controller riders. They’re
also fun to have as the draft animal for a “runaway wagon” scenario, as they
tend to be much harder to physically stop than horses.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Id fiends are big toothy lizards with psionic powers of fear manipulation,
which they use to hunt their preferred prey. Which is, of course, people.</p>

<p>As reasonably smart magical beasts, they are capable of making alliances with
other creatures, though these tend to be strained at best. More often, an id
fiend might craft fearful illusions to manipulate those creatures into helping
it attack others. When that happens, the best tactic is to focus on the id
fiend - when it dies, its control ends.</p>

<p>Id fiends are a major threat to civilians, but a favorite target of seasoned
monster hunters. The House of the Mind in Draj pays generously for live
specimens, whose fresh organs and fluids go into making alchemical potions meant
to awaken someone’s psychic potential. Many of those are dubious at best, but at
least some of them have real effects. The book mentions “terror ichor” by name -
this is a consumable reagent that can be used to enhance fear-based powers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>If Fiends are Large Aberrant Magical Beasts with the Reptile tag. This probably
makes them the most mundane-looking aberrants we saw so far. Just a big lizard,
not a tentacle in sight.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they end up filling the empty niche left by absence of low-level
dragons in Athas. They’re Level 1 Solo Controllers with 120 HP, Darkvision, a
Speed of 6, an immunity to Fear and Resist 5 Psychic.</p>

<p>A fiend can attack with a <strong>quick slash</strong> of its claws, which deals light
physical damage and lets it shift 1 square; with a bite of its <strong>Snapping Jaws</strong>
that deals more damage and slides the target 1 square; or with a <strong>Double
Attack</strong> that uses both.</p>

<p>Instead of a breath weapon, it has the <strong>Manifest Fear</strong> power (recharge 4+),
which affects enemies in a Close Burst 5. Those hit by it are dazed for a turn
as they see a vision of their worst fears becoming reality.</p>

<p>Once the fiend dazes a few enemies, it will use the <strong>Fearful Torment</strong> power, a
minor-action ranged attack that targets one or two tazed creatures. A hit deals
psychic damage, immobilizes, and inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks for a turn. I
guess this means it makes the vision of fear worse.</p>

<p>Once the fiend is first bloodied, Manifest Fear recharges and it can use the
power immediately as a free action.</p>

<p>Looks like id fiends prefer to use their fear powers to kill their victims if
possible, though they’re also perfectly capable of physical fighting as seen
above.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>A single id fiend makes a fine boss battle for beginner PCs. Once they gain a
level or two, you can begin to add thralls enraptured by visions of fear, and
fooled into thinking the PCs are monsters to be slain. As the book says, killing
the fiend will likely free the thralls.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting monster, I think. Effectively a low-level dragon that
breathes fear. You can level it up a bit to make it more challenging for
mid-Heroic PCs, but I’d probably set that as the upper bound of their power.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Remember how I keep mentioning Mixed Groups of People as possible encounter
groups? How they can be anything, allied or hostile, made up of free or enslaved
individuals, working for any one of the setting’s factions or none at all?</p>

<p>That’s exactly the kind of description you get for humans in this entry. They
are the most numerous humanoid species on Athas, they are infinitely varied and
adaptable, and all the other stuff you have read about them a thousand times in
other places. What this tells me is that those Mixed Groups of People will be
mostly made up of humans.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Humans in Athas are mechanically identical to humans elsewhere. Medium Natural
Humanoids with Speed 6, and with absolutely everything else determined by
training in each specific stat block.</p>

<p>Any of these stat blocks can easily be adjusted to represent a member of another
species by adding that species’ signature traits o it.</p>

<h3 id="human-slave">Human Slave</h3>

<p>If humans make up the bulk of those Mixed Groups of People, then it’s logical to
assume they also make up the bulk of Athas’ enslaved population. You’ll see them
in large numbers while walking down the street of any of the sorcerer-kings’
city states.</p>

<p>The Human Slave is a Level 1 Minion Brute, armed with a <strong>club</strong> that’s likely
improvised. They gain +1 bonus damage for each ally adjacent to their target,
and <strong>Laborer’s Resilience</strong> make them stay up for an additional turn after
being reduced to 0 HP.</p>

<p>As you can see, they’re quite bad at fighting, and will likely only do so if
they have no other choice. Only their large numbers make them a threat to
PCs.</p>

<h3 id="human-wasteland-raider">Human Wasteland Raider</h3>

<p>This is a typical member of those hostile Mixed Groups of People who attack you
while you’re traveling the wastes, intent on either killing you, taking your
stuff, or both. They’re Level 2 Soldiers with 40 HP.</p>

<p>The most striking thing about this stat block is the big editing error right in
the middle, a <strong>barbed spear</strong> attack that has no listed damage and should be
ignored. The raider’s actual weapon is a <strong>Dagger</strong> that does standard physical
damage and can be used in a stronger <strong>Gutting Dagger</strong> attack against someone
grabbed by the raider.</p>

<p>Maybe the spear was supposed to be the attack that grabbed the target? As it is,
the raider has to use the default rules and perform a Grab action to do
it. My suggestion here would be to replace the <strong>dagger</strong> basic attack with a
<strong>Barbed Spear</strong> that does the same damage, grabs on a hit, and cannot be used
against other targets while the raider has a target grabbed. Gutting Dagger
would then turn into Gutting Spear, with the same effects.</p>

<h3 id="human-dune-trader">Human Dune Trader</h3>

<p>I remember disliking the emphasis the book put on elven traders being unreliable
and dishonest, but it looks like it doesn’t have much better to say about the
human ones. This one is described as being flanked by burly bodyguards as he
cheerfully lies about the price and quality of his goods.</p>

<p>Dune Traders are Level 4 Controllers with the Leader tag and 55 HP. They’re
armed with <strong>hatchets</strong> that do physical damage and cause the target to grant
Combat Advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>While unbloodied, they can spend minor actions on <strong>Goading Commands</strong> that let
one ally within 6 squares move their speed as a free action. While bloodied,
this changes to a <strong>Furious Glare</strong>, a standard action that attacks the Will of
enemies in a Close Blast 3. It does no damage, but immobilizes and makes the
targets grant combat advantage on a hit (save ends both).</p>

<h3 id="human-gladiator-novice">Human Gladiator Novice</h3>

<p>Those gladiators who managed to survive their first few fights can go on to
achieve fame and greatness… but this one is still figuring out the surviving
part. There are many like him on every arena. He’s a level 4 Soldier with 55 HP.</p>

<p>The gladiator novice fights with a <strong>short sword</strong> that damages and marks on a
hit, and can perform a <strong>hamstring cut</strong> that does the same damage, knocks
prone, and slows (save ends). If an adjacent enemy stands up, the novice can
use <strong>Stay Down!</strong> as a reaction to attack their Reflex and knock them back down
on a hit.</p>

<p>The book remarks that gladiators are one of the opponent types that have
in-character reasons for picking less than optimal combat options during a
fight, as long as they make for a better show.</p>

<h3 id="human-overseer">Human Overseer</h3>

<p>Our first explicitly Evil stat block in this entry. The things they oversee are
the sale, transport, and daily (mis)treatment of slaves. Whether they display
malicious glee or banal apathy towards the cruelty that surrounds them, it
remains true that their job is to perpetuate it. They’re Level 9 Controllers
with the Leader tag and 96 HP.</p>

<p>Overseers are armed with <strong>Obsidian Swords</strong>, and they have extensive training
in psychic powers that assault and dominate the mind because of course they
do. They project a <strong>Mental Mire</strong> around themselves (aura 2) that slows enemies
who starts their turns inside. <strong>Not So Fast!</strong> is a ranged attack that deals
psychic damage and pulls 3 squares. And <strong>Do My Bidding</strong> targets one slowed
creature within 2 squares and dominates it for a turn on a hit. This one is
thankfully not at-will - it recharges when the overseer is bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="human-slavehunter">Human Slavehunter</h3>

<p>Another Evil entry. Slavehunters do what it says on the tin, roaming both the
wilds and the streets looking for new people to enslave. Anyone who looks like
they’d fetch a good price and won’t put up much of a fight is fair game. They’re
Level 10 Skirmishers with 103 HP.</p>

<p>This villain is armed with a <strong>Mace</strong> and a <strong>Obsidian-toothed Whip</strong>. A hit
with the mace lets them shift 1 square. A hit with the whip pulls the target 1
square and knocks it prone. As minor actions, they can use <strong>Swift Pursuit</strong> to
shift 3 squares (recharges when bloodied) or <strong>Cutting Lash</strong> to inflict ongoing
10 damage (save ends) on a prone creature as an encounter power.</p>

<p>The book mentions a power named “Face Smash”, but this isn’t present on the stat
block. I guess there were some editing hiccups, and it was replaced by Cutting
Lash without any changes to the surrounding text.</p>

<h3 id="human-templar-of-tyr">Human Templar of Tyr</h3>

<p>Fourth Edition Dark Sun is set right after the sorcerer-king of Tyr was deposed
and killed in a violent revolution, and this book describes the city’s templars
as being “cast adrift” and only relying on “themselves and each other” to impose
their will.</p>

<p>This seems to me like a fancy way to say they immediately pivoted to being a
crime syndicate after losing their official authority, though I remember
something in the older 2e books about Tyr still having some templars in its
government. This stat block is Evil, so I’m guessing it represents a “loyalist”
templar who is now a mobster.</p>

<p>This templar is a Level 10 Controller with 106 HP. It fights exclusively with
Force magic. Its basic melee attack is an <strong>Eldritch Spear</strong> that does force
damage and slides targets 1 square on a hit. The basic ranged attack is an
<strong>Eldritch Bolt</strong> that does the same amount of force damage and pushes 2
squares. <strong>Eldritch Cage</strong> (recharge 5+) is an Area Burst 2 spell that attacks
all creatures in the area. On a hit it restrains and deals 10 ongoing force
damage (save ends). The book says the templar is not shy about including some of
its own allies in the area if it will help them get more PCs.</p>

<p>None of the templar’s powers explicitly mention defiling, but you could give
them a version of the next stat block’s passive trait if you wish.</p>

<h3 id="human-defiler">Human Defiler</h3>

<p>In Athas, despoiling an already ravaged ecosystem is a big taboo that’s sure to
draw the ire of those who see you do it… unless you’re a sorcerer-king or a
templar, I guess. The defilers represented by this stat block are neither, but
they really want to be and think the scorn of the ignorant masses is a light
price to pay for Ultimate Cosmic Power. You could also uses these stats for a
higher-ranking templar.</p>

<p>The Human Defiler is Level 14 Artillery with 108 HP (and also Evil). It has the
<strong>Defiling</strong> passive trait, which deals 5 necrotic damage to all enemies within
3 squares whenever the defiler uses an implement power.</p>

<p>Its only non-implement power is a <strong>staff</strong> bonk that causes a mix of physical
and necrotic damage. The templar prefers to fight from a distance with lightning
spells. <strong>Lightning Lance</strong> is a basic ranged attack that does lightning damage,
and <strong>Lightning Serpent</strong>, an encounter power that does a bit less lightning
damage but also inflicts ongoing 10 poison damage (save ends). Once per
encounter, the Defiler can use <strong>Dimension Door</strong> to teleport 10 squares,
something it will probably use as an emergency escape measure.</p>

<p>When an enemy within 10 squares of the defiler spends a healing surge, it can
use <strong>Defiling Serpent</strong> as a free action to regain HP equal to half the value
of the triggering surge and recharge Lightning Serpent.</p>

<h3 id="human-mind-adept">Human Mind Adept</h3>

<p>We’re out of the Evil Zone again. This is a powerful human telepath that can be
cast in any role, friendly or not: a Level 15 Controller with 145 HP.</p>

<p>Mind adepts rely solely on their powers (and on their teammates, of course) for
defense. We start with an aura (2) of <strong>Overwhelming Thoughts</strong> that makes it so
any enemy that ends their turn inside cannot target the adept with an attack
until the end of their next turn. This means melee-based PCs will only be
attacking them every other turn.</p>

<p>Pretty much all of the adept’s attacks are psychic powers that target Will. For
melee, we have the <strong>Mind-Wracking Touch</strong> dealing psychic damage and making the
target grant combat advantage for a turn. For greater ranges we have the at-will
<strong>Paralyzing Blast</strong> (close blast 5) which targets enemies, deals light psychic
damage, and immobilizes for a turn on a hit.</p>

<p>The adept’s ultimate technique is <strong>Will of the Master</strong>, a ranged attack that
deals no damage and dominates (save ends). While the target is dominated, it
emits harmful psychic waves: any enemy that starts their turn within 2 squares
of the target takes 5 psychic damage and is immobilized for a turn. This is an
encounter power that recharges whenever it misses.</p>

<p>When the adept is reduced to 0 HP, it causes <strong>Mental Overload</strong> in a Close
Burst 1. This targets enemies and on a hit deals psychic damage and stuns for a
turn.</p>

<h3 id="human-blade-noble">Human Blade Noble</h3>

<p>The most powerful human in this entry is not a wizard or a psychic, but someone
who is Just That Good with a sword. Or in other words: Hello, Ms. Malenia! Fancy
meeting you here. This is a Level 17 Controller with 163 HP.</p>

<p>The blade noble has a trait named <strong>Unpredictable Flank</strong> that gives them combat
advantage against any enemy adjacent to one of their allies. No need to setup a
by-the-book flanking position.</p>

<p>They fight with a <strong>Duelist’s Blade</strong>, which given the context is probably one
of the few magical steel swords that still survive in Athas. Its basic attacks
do physical damage and slide the target 1 square.</p>

<p><strong>Dance of Blades</strong> (recharge 6+) is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlnv_DCBEa8">technique</a> that reminded me of
Malenia: it attacks enemies in a Close Burst 2, deals the same damage as a basic
attack, immobilizes, and inflicts ongoing 5 damage (save ends). On a miss it
still does half damage, which is a rarity on a rechargeable attack. The noble
can shift 2 squares as an effect as well.</p>

<p>For triggered actions we have <strong>Whirling Parry</strong>, an encounter power that
triggers when an ally of the noble’s within 2 squares is hit by a melee or
ranged attack. As an interrupt, the noble shifts 2 squares to be adjacent to the
ally and rolls an attack using its standard bonus vs. AC. If that’s higher than
the triggering attack roll, the triggering attack misses.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The individual stat blocks are pretty cool, but the lore is your standard Humans
Are The Most Generic thing. In the end this ends up being a very ecletic set of
People that you can reskin as any species and any narrative role that best fits
your specific campaign.</p>

<p>I know some more recent games have explicitly gone this route for pretty much
every humanoid NPC, giving us stat blocks based on narrative or mechanical role
(“Bandit”, “Guard”, “Brute”, “Wizard”) and then letting us assign any species as
necessary. D&amp;D 4e wasn’t quite there yet, but ended up doing it by accident on
this entry.</p>
