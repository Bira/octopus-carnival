<p>As I write this, RPGnet forum user zedturtle is just starting a Let’s Read of
the Dark Sun Campaign Setting for 4e, and I thought I’d join in on the fun by
doing a parallel Let’s Read of the Creature Catalog.</p>

<p>The Creature Catalog was published alongside the Campaign Setting in 2010, and
is the “second to last” monster book published for D&amp;D Fourth Edition. The last
one would be Threats to the Nentir Vale, which I already covered and which can
be read either <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">in my blog</a> or on the <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/lets-read-threats-to-the-nentir-vale.904788/">RPG.net forums</a>. It did still come
after the Monster Manual 3, and so enjoys the rules and formatting improvements
that came with that book.</p>

<p>The book opens up with a short description of the stat block format, and tells
us that the book is divided into two sections. “Monsters A to Z” is the kind of
thing you’ve come to expect from a monster book, and “Personages of Athas” is a
bunch of important NPCs and major villains like the Sorcerer Kings.</p>

<h2 id="fourth-edition-monster-rules-a-refesher">Fourth Edition Monster Rules: A Refesher</h2>

<p>I posted something similar at the start of every monster book Let’s Read, and
I’ll do so again this time, since it’s been a while.</p>

<h3 id="level-and-role">Level and Role</h3>

<p>Unlike 3e and 5e, Fourth Edition D&amp;D doesn’t have the concept of a “Challenge
Rating”. Monsters instead have levels ranging from 1 to 30, just like PCs. A
monster’s base attack bonus, damage, defenses, and HP are all based on its
level, with adjustments for its combat role.</p>

<p>A monster’s combat role determines the monster’s baseline stats and most of its
preferred tactics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Skirmishers are highly mobile melee combatants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soldiers have good AC, accurate attacks, and usually some ability that helps
draw PC attention to themselves. They form a “front line” that protects Team
Monster’s squishier damage dealers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brutes deal heavy damage and have more HP, but are a bit less accurate and
easier to hit. They’re also good components of the front line, particularly
when paired with soldiers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Controllers are good at both melee and ranged combat, and have lots of area
attacks and other powers that impose negative conditions on PCs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Artillery monsters have strong and accurate ranged attacks, but are worse at
melee and kinda fragile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lurkers are fragile in a direct fight but have attacks that deal huge damage
if certain conditions are met. Most commonly, that’s when they attack from
hiding. They have abilities that let them re-establish that condition, so a
typical lurker will attack one turn and spend the next one hiding again.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to this “primary” role, there are some extra roles a monster might
have. An Elite monster is worth two regular monsters, with double the HP and
some ability to perform multiple attacks per turn. A Solo monster is worth five
regulars, has four times the HP, attacks that affect a large number of PCs at
the same time, and usually some resistance to being “stun-locked”. Minions are
weak monsters that deal half the damage for their level and always have 1 HP
(but cannot be damaged by missed attacks). Four to six minions are worth one
regular monster.</p>

<p>Finally, a monster tagged as a Leader will have abilities that enhance their
buddies somehow.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.blogofholding.com/?p=512">famous post</a> from the Blog of Holding has the individual monster design
formula written out as compactly as possible. This also shows us that it’s easy
to adjust a monster’s level on the fly, if needed.</p>

<h3 id="origin-and-type">Origin and Type</h3>

<p>Monsters also have an origin and a type, though that’s more of a lore component
and doesn’t affect mechanics like it does in 3e and 5e.</p>

<p>The origin tells us the place in 4e’s cosmology to which the monster is most
closely tied, even if it’s not currently where it lives. Each of the big planes
has its own origin tag. Natural monsters are from the natural world (known as
the “Prime Material” in other editions), Fey monsters from the Feywild, Aberrant
monsters are tied to the Far Realm, and so on.</p>

<p>Monster type is largely “vibes” based in a way I really like:</p>

<p>Beasts behave like animals; magical beasts look like animals and behave like
people; humanoids look and behave like people; animates are non-intelligent
things that move because of magic. A giant ant is a natural beast, an elf is a
fey humanoid, a shield guardian is a natural animate, a zombie is a shadow
animate.</p>

<p>Humanoid doesn’t even mean “two arms and two legs”: centaurs are fey humanoids!
I love this system. In previous readings, I tended to go with Int scores and the
like to guess if a monster was sapient or not, but in this one I’m going mostly
from the classification.</p>

<h3 id="encounter-design">Encounter Design</h3>

<p>When designing encounters, the GM decides the encounter’s level (which is
usually from 1 to 35). That and the number of PCs in the party gives them a XP
budget for the encounter. The easiest way to fill this budget is to add a number
of regular monsters equal to the number of PCs, of the same level as the
encounter. Obviously GMs can mix it up by varying monster levels, and adding
minions, elites or solos too.</p>

<p>Encounter level <em>doesn’t</em> have to be equal to the party’s level. An “equal
level” encounter is considered a easy-to-moderate difficulty fight. Level-1 or
Level-2 are easy, and anything lower than that is not worth playing out using
the full combat rules. Level+4 or Level+5 are scary nightmare battles where
victory is no longer assured, suitable for final boss fights. Anything harder
than that will dramatically increase the chances of a TPK.</p>

<p>Encounters don’t <em>have</em> to be “perfectly balanced”, not anymore than they do in
any other edition. What this system does is deliver <em>consistent</em> encounters. If
you want them to be easy, they’ll be easy. If you want them to be hard, they’ll
be hard. The number of times where the opposite of what you want happens is kept
to a minimum. And that’s why I love these rules to bits.</p>

<h2 id="coming-up-next">Coming up Next</h2>

<p>Starting from the next post, we’ll get right to the monster entries!</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Este post é completamente diferente do conteúdo usual do Octopus Carnival, mas
obter a informação aqui foi tão complicado que eu me sinto compelido a deixar
instruções para as gerações futuras (e para mim mesmo, caso eu esqueça). Ele
está em português porque estas instruções são relevantes para quem está no
Brasil.</p>

<p>Neste artigo, eu vou explicar todos os passos necessários para emitir e instalar
um certificado digital A3 (e-CPF ou e-CNPJ) em uma máquina rodando Ubuntu 22.04
ou 24.04.</p>

<p>O post foi originalmente escrito no meio de 2024, mas até onde eu sei suas
instruções ainda são válidas.</p>

<h2 id="background-e-introdução">Background e Introdução</h2>

<p>Pode pular essa sessão inteira se você só quer as instruções. Vá direto aos
Pré-Requisitos.</p>

<p>Apenas uma raríssima minoria das certificadoras brasileiras sequer apresenta
instruções para emitir um utilizar um certificado A3 em Linux, e essas
instruções são invariavelmente para uma versão mais antiga do Ubuntu, como a
18.04 ou a 20.04. Se você tem uma versão mais recente, como provavelmente é o
caso, você está por conta própria. O propósito deste artigo é remediar isso. Ele
reúne informações de diversas fontes separadas.</p>

<p>Minha inspiração para escrever este post foi <a href="https://linuxuniverse.com.br/linux/token-a3">este outro excelente artigo</a>
que explica muitas das mesmas coisas. A diferença aqui é que ele usa uma versão
um pouco mais antiga de alguns softwares, com instalação mais complicada.</p>

<h2 id="pré-requisitos">Pré-requisitos</h2>

<p>Você precisa de um computador rodando a versão mais atualizada do Ubuntu 22.04
ou 24.04, ou um de seus derivados (como o Pop OS). Os passos a seguir em geral
são válidos para as duas versões, com uma única excessão:</p>

<p><strong>O Assinador SERPRO só pode ser instalado no Ubuntu 22.04 ou derivados!</strong> A
versão mais recente quando da autoria deste post é a 4.2.1, que depende da
biblioteca <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libappindicator1</code>, que por sua vez foi removida do Ubuntu 24.04.</p>

<h2 id="passo-1-adquira-o-token">Passo 1: Adquira o Token</h2>

<p>Escolher um dispositivo físico com bom suporte a Linux costumava ser uma dor de
cabeça sem tamanho, mas isso agora está bem mais fácil: usaremos um token USB do
modelo Safenet eToken 5110.</p>

<p>Se você conhecer uma certificadora que venda certificados A3 em tokens com esse
modelo, pode pular este passo, o passo 3, e o passo 6. Caso contrário,
precisamos de um token vazio para cada certificado que queremos obter. Cada
token guarda apenas um único certificado. A <a href="https://loja.digitalsecurity.com.br/">Digital Security do Brasil</a>
vende tokens vazios, e ela não é a única. Se tiver outra loja de sua confiança,
pode encomendar por lá.</p>

<h2 id="passo-2-instale-o-driver-do-token">Passo 2: Instale o Driver do Token</h2>

<p>Mesmo um token USB ainda precisa de um driver especializado para ser lido. O
eToken 5110 utiliza o Safenet Authentication Client, e foi por isso que eu o
escolhi - ele roda em ambas as versões do Ubuntu visadas por este artigo e tem
uma interface um pouco mais agradável e completa.</p>

<p>Precisamos da versão 10.8 do cliente. A maioria dos lugares só tem até a 10.7
para download, mas a GlobalSign tem a 10.8 <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/en/safenet-drivers/USB/10.8/GlobalSign-SAC-Ubuntu-2204.zip">aqui</a>.</p>

<p>Faça o download (é gratuito e não requer registro), extraia o arquivo zip, e
ache o arquivo chamado <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">safenetauthenticationclient_10.8.1050_amd64.deb</code> dentro
da estrutura. Instale-o em seu sistema usando os seguintes comandos:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>dpkg <span class="nt">-i</span> safenetauthenticationclient_10.8.1050_amd64.deb
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">--fix-broken</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>O primeiro comando acima instala o pacote; o segundo instala quaisquer
dependências dele que estejam faltando. Todas essas dependências existem nos
repositórios padrão do Ubuntu 22.04 e 24.04.</p>

<h2 id="passo-3-inicialize-o-token">Passo 3: Inicialize o Token</h2>

<p>Cada token deve ter duas senhas associadas a ele. Uma senha “de usuário” (PIN)
que é usada para acessar o conteúdo do token, e uma senha de administração (PUK)
que é usada para modificar as informações dele. Neste passo vamos definir as
duas para o(s) token(s) que você adquiriu no primeiro passo.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.locasuporte.com.br/suporte_manuais/safenet/manual_etoken5110.pdf">Este manual</a> explica como inicializar um eToken 5110 vazio usando o Safenet
Authentication Client que instalamos no passo anterior. As instruções relevantes
começam na página 11. Lembre-se de anotar as senhas em um local seguro, como um
gerenciador de senhas. Elas não podem ser recuperadas de outra maneira depois de
definidas.</p>

<p>O processo basicamente consiste em mudar as senhas de um valor pré-defindo “de
fábrica” para os valores que você deseja. Se você adquiriu o seu token de outra
loja que não a Digital Security, pode ser que a senha default seja outra -
cheque o manual que vier com ele. <strong>Jamais mantenha a senha de fábrica do
token!</strong></p>

<h2 id="passo-4-compre-seu-certificado-a3">Passo 4: Compre Seu Certificado A3</h2>

<p>Aqui eu tive uma boa experiência com a <a href="https://www.soluti.com.br/">Soluti</a> e o <a href="https://www.mafragrupo.com.br/">Grupo Mafra</a>. Em
ambos os casos foi necessário falar com o canal de vendas por WhatsApp deles
para especificar que eu precisava de um certificado digital A3 sem mídia. A
Soluti vende e-CPF e e-CNPJ - eles têm loja virtual mas para adquirir sem mídia
ainda é necessário falar com um representante. O Grupo Mafra vende direto por
WhatsApp e representa a certificadora ABS, que no final das contas também emite
certificado pela Soluti - mas o preço deles é bem menor.</p>

<p>Em ambos os casos o procedimento foi o mesmo. Após pagar o certificado, marquei
uma videoconferência pelo sistema deles, na qual foi verificada minha identidade
e obti uma <em>senha de emissão e revogação</em>. No caso da Mafra/ABS, fui direcionado
a uma página onde eu mesmo gerei a senha. No caso da Soluti, eles me passaram a
senha durante a chamada de vídeo.</p>

<p>Após o sucesso da chamada, recebi um e-mail com um assunto parecido com
“Solicitação de Certificado Digital aprovada”. No corpo desse e-mail, há um
número de solicitação e um “Usuário de Emissão”. Esse é o nome de usuário que
faz par com a senha obtida na chamada. Precisamos dos dois para os próximos
passos.</p>

<h2 id="passo-5-instale-o-java-8">Passo 5: Instale o Java 8</h2>

<p>Sim, é o Java. Sim, é o oito. Vamos precisar dele para rodar o programa que
realiza a emissão dos certificados. Felizmente, não precisa ser o java da
Oracle. Use o seguinte comando:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>openjdk-8-jdk icedtea-netx
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Isso instala a mais recente versão do OpenJDK 8, que tem paridade com o da
Oracle para os nossos propósitos. O <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">icedtea-netx</code> nos dá a funcionalidade do
Java Web Start porque sim, também precisamos disso.</p>

<p>Após instalar o JDK, configure seu sistema para que ele seja o
padrão. Precisamos fazer isto de duas maneiras diferentes. A primeira é:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>update-alternatives <span class="nt">--config</span> java
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Isso vai mostrar um menu com os diferentes executáveis Java no seu
sistema. Mesmo que você não tenha instalado nenhum antes do 8, pode ser que o
sistema tenha instalado o 11 junto. Pressione o número correspondente ao <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java</code>
to JDK 8 e depois <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;enter&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Depois, use esta sequência de comandos para fazer o Java Web Start entender que
queremos executá-lo com Java 8:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> /usr/lib/jvm/
<span class="nb">sudo rm </span>default-java
<span class="nb">sudo ln</span> <span class="nt">-s</span> java-8-openjdk-amd64 default-java
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="passo-6-prepare-para-a-emissão">Passo 6: Prepare para a Emissão</h2>

<p>Com o Safenet Authentication Client rodando, plugue o seu token vazio no
computador. Tenha à mão a senha PIN gerada no passo 3, e também o usuário e
senha obtidos no passo 4.</p>

<p>A Soluti possui um manual de emissão bem completo <a href="https://www.soluti.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Instalacao-A3.pdf">aqui</a>. Note que já fizemos
muito do que está lá: temos o driver certo do nosso token, e a versão correta do
Java.</p>

<p>Seguindo o manual, o próximo passo é baixar o aplicativo emissor <a href="https://emissor.ca.inf.br/prod/Emissor.jnlp">aqui</a>. Você
vai notar que isso é um arquivo de extensão <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jnlp</code>. É por isso que precisamos do
Java Web Start.</p>

<p>Em um terminal, vá ao diretório onde você baixou o arquivo <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Emissor.jnlp</code> e
execute o seguinte commando:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>javaws Emissor.jnlp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Você pode a partir daqui seguir o <a href="https://www.soluti.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Instalacao-A3.pdf">manual da Soluti</a>. Como já disse, vai
precisar do nome de usuário e senha do Passo 4 para iniciar a emissão, e a senha
do passo 3 para abrir seu token para a gravação das chaves e certificados.</p>

<p>Ao final deste passo, você já tem seu certificado digital emitido! Os próximos
passos deixam seu sistema pronto para <em>usar</em> o certificado.</p>

<h2 id="passo-7-certifique-se-de-que-o-firefox-é-um-pacote-deb">Passo 7: Certifique-se de que o Firefox é um pacote .deb</h2>

<p>Conforme é dito no <a href="https://linuxuniverse.com.br/linux/token-a3">post que me inspirou a inscrever este artigo</a>, a versão
Snap do Firefox, que vem com o Ubuntu, não reconhece o token, porque não tem
acesso às portas USB. Precisamos instalar o browser como um pacote .deb
tradicional.</p>

<p>É possível que você já tenha feito isso por algum outro motivo, ou esteja usando
uma variante que já faz isso como o Pop_OS. Se esse for o caso, pode pular este
passo.</p>

<p>Caso contrário, adicione o PPA da equipe Mozilla às suas fontes de software:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Em seguida, crie um arquivo chamado <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/preferences.d/mozilla-firefox</code> com os
seguintes conteúdos:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Package: firefox<span class="k">*</span>
Pin: release <span class="nv">o</span><span class="o">=</span>LP-PPA-mozillateam
Pin-Priority: 1001

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Isso guarante que a versão do PPA tenha precedência sobre o Snap. A seguir,
remova o Snap e instale a versão do PPA:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>snap remove firefox

<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt remove firefox

<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-t</span> <span class="s1">'o=LP-PPA-mozillateam'</span> firefox
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="passo-8-adicione-suporte-ao-token-ao-firefox">Passo 8: Adicione Suporte ao Token ao Firefox</h2>

<p>Vá em “Edit” -&gt; “Settings” e procure por “Security Devices”. Clique o botão que
aparece nos resultados.</p>

<p>Na janela que vai aparecer, clique em “NSS Internal PKCS #11 Module”, depois em
“Load” no canto direito da tela. No diálogo que aparecer, dê o nome que quiser
ao módulo e em “Module filename” entre <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/lib/libeToken.so</code>.</p>

<p>O módulo vai carregar e aparecer na lista do canto esquerdo desta mesma
janela. A partir daí você pode plugar seu token, escolher “Log In”, e entrar com
a senha PIN dele para ter acesso ao certificado.</p>

<p>Com isso, você já pode usar seu certificado para realizar login em serviços que
o exijam. Ele também permite que procurações sejam assinadas pelo serviço e-CAC
do Ministério da Fazenda.</p>

<h2 id="passo-9-assinador-serpro">Passo 9: Assinador SERPRO</h2>

<p>Conforme dito na introdução, <strong>o Assinador SERPRO só pode ser instalado em
Ubuntu 22.04 ou derivados</strong>.</p>

<p>Se o seu sistema se encaixa nessa categoria, basta seguir o <a href="https://tutorial.assinadorserpro.estaleiro.serpro.gov.br/html/demo_4.html">tutorial</a> da
própria SERPRO. Isso vai instalar a versão 4.2.1 do assinador, que é a mais
recente quando da autoria deste post. O Assinador SERPRO é usado para assinar
documentos em PDF ou XML em sua máquina local.</p>

<p>We’re firmly in the wrap-up stage now. If you’re here, the PCs have succeeded at
dismantling the powerful magical defenses of the Temple of Asmodeus and
disrupted a dire summoning ritual that was Barzilai Thrune’s last attempt at
squashing the Silver Raven rebellion. They made it out with a literal dragon’s
hoard worth of loot and if they were particularly skilled they might even have
managed to kill Thrune himself during the raid! In this post, we’ll see what all
of that means for the rebellion.</p>

<h2 id="strategic-and-campaign-implications">Strategic and Campaign Implications</h2>

<p>As far as the rebellion is concerned, it has achieved its major goal. All of the
Thrune leadership has been neutralized one way or the other, ceding control of
not just Kintargo but the entire province of Ravounel.</p>

<p>The next few days immediately after the PC’s victory at the temple are a flurry
of activity as the former rebel organization sets itself up as the new
government. If Jilia Bailinus has been rescued and revived (a likely outcome),
then she’s immediately reinstated as Lord Mayor. Otherwise the job goes to a
sympatethic noble or priestly NPC - the players should have some input on who
gets the job.</p>

<p>The new mayor will have several difficult issues to solve in the medium term,
but for now it’s time to celebrate!</p>

<h2 id="the-silver-span-celebration">The Silver Span Celebration</h2>

<p>All of the PC’s heroics quickly become common knowledge, now that there is no
more need for secrecy on their part. Soon after they recover from the temple
raid, they and their allies are invited to a huge party in their honor. It takes
place on Bleakbridge - the same spot where the PCs busted a blockade in Part 01
of the adventure.</p>

<p>The place is quite crowded now. A wooden stage has been erected right in the
middle of the bridge, where a whole bunch of statues are covered with cloth
awaiting for their unveiling. The PCs, every single member of the Silver Ravens,
and anyone else whom they had positive interactions with will be at the party.</p>

<p>Some time after the party gets going, the mayor calls the PCs up to the stage,
makes a speech renaming the bridge from Bleakbridge to the Silver Span, and
unveils the statues. These represent all the PCs, plus any NPCs who were
especially important to the rebellion’s success at the group’s discretion. These
are going to be installed along the Silver Span, as an eternal reminder of their
heroic deeds.</p>

<p>The PCs themselves are then presented with silver Keys to the City! The keys are
worth quite a bit of money, but the real prize here is the major reputation
boost that comes with being recognized as an official hero. That’s a hefty bonus
to gather information or perform for money in the city, as well as a permanent
10% discount on all Kintargan shops that don’t have reason to actively hate the
characters.</p>

<p>Before we can close the curtains on this adventure, however, there is the small
matter of the retributive strike.</p>

<h2 id="from-hells-heart">From Hell’s Heart</h2>

<p>… I stab at thee! That’s a particularly appropriate quote here.</p>

<p>You see, right after the PCs receive those keys, the remnants of the Thrune
faction teleport in and try to kill the PCs. I don’t think they can take the
province back at this point - this is simply done out of spite.</p>

<p>Who the attackers are depend on what exactly happened so far. From the worst
case to the best one, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Barzilai on a Fucking Dragon</strong>: If both Thrune and the dragon Rivozair are
still alive, they both show up, with Thrune riding the dragon. This happens
even if Rivozair fled the city after being defeated by the PCs in their
previous confrontation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Barzilai OR a Fucking Dragon</strong>: if either one of the pair is dead, the other
still attacks. Rivozair shows up alone; Thrune appears accompanied by four
bone devils.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Dregs</strong>: If both main baddies are dead, the GM should build a CR 13
encounter with any secondary villains who managed to escape death over the
course of the adventure, focusing on those the players loved to hate the
most. If there are not enough to hit CR 13 on their own, fill the encounter
with appropriate minions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No One!</strong>: Particularly thorough groups might have not left anyone alive to
attempt revenge! The chance of this happening is quite low, as there are a lot
of named villains here and many of them will make an effort to escape when
first fought. But if this does happen, just skip this battle altogether.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If anyone shows up at all, they fight to the death this time around regardless
of their previous cowardice. This encounter is the “main event”, and it’s
accompanied by a “sideshow” in the form of a bunch of loyalist dottari and minor
devils who arrive more conventionally and try to slaughter the crowd. These keep
the rest of the NPC Silver Ravens occupied, and are handled as series of
Security checks to prevent civilian deaths.</p>

<p>Thrune remains as hard to kill as ever, but this time the PCs are fully rested
and have no other encounters to worry about. And with all those NPCs present,
someone is bound to have a handy spell to finish him off if the PCs don’t have
one of their own.</p>

<h3 id="victory-tally">Victory Tally</h3>

<p>After this fight is over, we finally get to tally the party’s XP award for
liberating Kintargo. This depends entirely on how many inhabitants have survived
the whole ordeal.</p>

<p>The city starts the game with 11900 inhabitants, according to its stat sheet in
the Player’s Guide. The GM is supposed to keep track of this number from the
start of the campaign until now. There are several events in the strategic layer
(Thrune reprisals, mostly) that kill a number of innocents and reduce this
number. Deaths of innocents during the “tactical adventuring” portions also
reduce the number - for example, the Ruby Masquerade trap, or if the PCs fail to
rescue a sacrifice victim.</p>

<p>If the city has at least 9000 surviving inhabitants at the end of this last
party, the game considers the rebellion an Unmitigated Success. 7500 or more
survivors makes for a Grim Success, and less than that is a pyrrhic victory
marked by Tragic Loss. I think it’s quite hard to end up with less than 9000
citizens unless the group completely fails to prevent the Ruby Masquerade
massacre and really slacks off during the “hot war” portion of this adventure.</p>

<h2 id="the-chelish-crux">The Chelish Crux</h2>

<p>This device, apparently a Hellraiser-style puzzle box, is also the plot coupon I
mentioned earlier. It sits inside Barzilai Thrune’s chest cavity - he replaced
his heart with it back during adventure 2. The book mentions that retrieving
this thing from Thrune’s corpse and opening it up are vital steps to proceed
with the remaining two adventures in the campaign.</p>

<h2 id="concluding-the-adventure-and-what-happens-next">Concluding the Adventure, and What Happens Next</h2>

<p>First of all, nothing <em>has</em> to happen from this point on. This is an excellent
stopping point for the campaign if the GM doesn’t feel like spending money on
the last two volumes. Just remove the Crux, and say that Barzilai has lost his
chance to become a genius loci by dying. He’s in Hell forever. Campaign
complete, mission accomplished, let’s leave nation-building to the government
and retire as glorious heroes.</p>

<p>If you do want to continue playing Hell’s Rebels, though, then the Crux still
exists and the situation is the following:</p>

<p>Kintargo is free for now, and Cheliax is busy fighting the Glorious Reclamation
in its heartland, but that situation won’t last much longer. Cheliax will
eventually send an army to retake the city, which won’t be able to hold against
an all-out military assault. The key to solving that problem happens to be
inside the Chelish Crux, and we’ll deal with that in the next adventure.</p>

<p>Barzilai himself isn’t exactly out of the picture either. Even dead, he’s still
on track to become a genius loci, and solving the Cheliax issue will actually
make that process much faster. Dealing with him once and for all is the subject
of the last adventure in the campaign.</p>

<p>Before I launch into a description of the big dungeon raid in this adventure, I
think it’s useful to go over some background information.</p>

<h2 id="barzilais-desperation-move">Barzilai’s Desperation Move</h2>

<p>As we say back in the background for Adventure 01, Barzilai’s scheme to become a
genius loci will only work exactly as planned if he dies a natural death from
old age. So he very much wants to keep on living.</p>

<p>As soon as he sees he’s lost the upper hand in the rebellion (at Authority 0),
the dictator will turtle up in the Temple of Asmodeus, and will order its high
priest to enact a ritual to contact Mephistopheles directly. The ritual takes
three days and a lot of sacrifices to complete, and when it does Mephistopheles
answers by sending <em>six pit fiends</em> to serve Barzilai and by giving him and all
his underlings a major boost in stats that’s going to last for a whole month. So
you can see why the PCs should be very interested in stopping this. This is why
the final part of this adventure is an assault on the temple.</p>

<h2 id="the-song-of-silver">The Song of Silver</h2>

<p>Fortunately, after completing all the missions in Part 01 of this adventure, the
PCs should have eliminated some of Barzilai’s main goons and acquired everything
they need to perform the Song of Silver: the score, the lyrics, and control of
the Opera House.</p>

<p>The Song of Silver is a ritual developed by the original Silver Ravens. It must
be performed on stage at the Kintargo Opera House, though it doesn’t really
require an audience beyond the PCs and maybe some of their main allies. It’s
short, taking only one minute to sing, and requires a skill test that should by
now be trivial for any bard in the party. Shensen can also sing it if there are
no PCs trained in Performance.</p>

<p>As soon as it completes, the dome of the opera house shines with a bright light
and the whole city is enveloped in a protective field that lasts for seven
days. While it’s active, all weapons in the city count as being made of silver,
and all evil outsiders must succeed at a moderately difficult caster level check
to teleport or use similar abilities. The performer, every other PC, and up to
four additional allies also gain a major bonus on saves against charm and
compulsion effects, and become completely immune to fear. They can choose to end
this blessing to automatically pass a save, or to gain the effects of the
<em>breath of life</em> spell (which yes, can return them to life if they die).</p>

<p>The song can only be performed once a month - the PCs should ideally only need
to perform it once in this adventure. When it’s performed for the first time,
Barzilai’s Authority is reduced by 15 if that’s still an issue. It would be
optimal if the PCs went into the Temple while under the effects of the Song, as
it makes the assault much easier.</p>

<h2 id="the-temple-of-asmodeus">The Temple of Asmodeus</h2>

<p>The temple is a very large round building. It used to be dedicated to Aroden but
was converted to the worship of Asmodeus when House Thrune took over
Kintargo. The Asmodeans sacrificed all the remaining priests of the dead god
back then, turning them into undead that hang around the temple and help defend
it. In addition to this atrocious contingent, the place is as heavily fortified
as its current occupants could make it.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, when Thrune’s forces retreat to the temple its Asmodean
priests will begin a summoning ritual that will mean Game Over for the
rebellion. This takes 3 days to complete, so that’s the window of time the PCs
have to stop it. You should definitely inform them of this.</p>

<p>PCs can use rebellion actions to make their assault on the temple easier. These
require DC 30 Secrecy checks, so if you haven’t been tracking the Rebellion
rules so far, that’s where the PCs should put their +15. Their actions during
the previous missions will gain them allies that will further help with
this. One of the actions gives them a nearly complete map of the temple. The
other sabotages the ritual, making it take 6 days instead of 3, penalizing its
divine spellcasters (they’re demoralized!) and even reducing the frequency with
which the temple bells ring (see below).</p>

<h3 id="raiding-the-temple">Raiding the Temple</h3>

<p>The Temple of Asmodeus is a huuuge dungeon, and detailing every one of its rooms
would be a bigger slog than raiding the place in play. So let’s take a more
concise approach.</p>

<p>The party has two main goals when raiding the temple: disrupt the infernal
ritual, and disable the cursed bells that are the temple’s main defense. This
will break the remaining morale of the Thrune leadership, and cause them to flee
the city.</p>

<p>The first thing is to get inside. There are three double doors on the temple’s
ground floor and a balcony with another double door on the second floor. All
four are protected by a magical trap that can teleport a PC straight to Hell
unless it’s disarmed or dispelled first by the usual means.</p>

<p>The ground floor doors lead to empty foyer areas from which the PCs can either
go to the central nave or through doors into a series of small side rooms. The
balcony door leads directly into the rooms in the second floor loft.</p>

<p>As soon as the PCs enter, they must contend with some temple-wide magical
defenses. There’s an effect similar to the Unhallow spell which is powered by a
pair of “infernal engines”. These engines also maintain a series of more
localized magical hazards inside the temple.</p>

<p>After every fight in here, the bells gather 1d6 power points (1d4 if the ritual
was disrupted). When they reach 10 they ring, which inflicts a random bad effect
on the PCs. The Song of Silver can help resist some of them, but the only way to
stop the bells is to reach the belfry and exorcise them.</p>

<p>The ritual is happening in the nave on the center of the ground floor, but going
there directly is suicidal. The enemies at that location are not only a hard
encounter, they can also issue a general alert that will draw many of the
temple’s other defenders there.</p>

<p>The optimal route would be to enter through the balcony, which puts the PCs on
the second floor loft where they can head more or less directly to the infernal
engines. This is something they should be able to figure out if they get the
full map through a covert action.</p>

<p>Each engine is a magic circle carved on the stone floor with an imprisoned
outsider inside. The circle slowly drains the outsider’s life force and uses it
to power the temple’s security system. Disabling them requires either expert use
of Thief skills, damaging the (very tough) floor carving, or killing the “fuel
source”. One holds a rakshasa, the other a lillend azata. Both have a high
number of negative levels and will gladly join in as temporary allies if those
are restored, despite their opposite alignments.</p>

<p>With the engines disabled, it’s time to take care of the reinforcements. The
dragon Rivozair has most likely been defeated before the PCs make it into the
temple, but if that didn’t happen for some reason she will be in her lair here
on the second floor. She will join in to defend the ritual unless she’s defeated
first. In either case her hoard will be here, which is something to keep in mind
for after the dungeon is cleared.</p>

<p>The rest of the reinforcements are in the side rooms on the ground floor. Most
of these rooms are used in the temple’s day to day activities and populated
either by the people and monsters responsible for those activities, or by
assigned defenders. Many of these would respond to a general alarm, but none of
them can raise one. Individually, each room is a medium-to-easy encounter, made
a bit easier by the fact that the engines are already off.</p>

<p>With the reinforcements neutralized and the engines disabled, it’s finally time
to assault the ritual. The team performing it can stop for long enough to put up
a fight: that’s High Priest Grivenner, five lower-ranking clerics, and five
summoned devils. Also in the room is a vampire high priestess of Zon-Kuthon (the
shadow-and-torture god) acting as a bodyguard, and a fiendish-shadow-snake thing
that will become a lot weaker with the infernal engines disabled.</p>

<p>It’s still a tough fight, but much more manageable without additional enemy
waves or magic hazards. Theoretically there are several ways to disrupt the
ritual, but “killing everyone involved” is probably the best one.</p>

<h3 id="optional-goal-kill-thrune">Optional Goal: Kill Thrune</h3>

<p>This is the first time in the whole adventure path where the books recognize the
PCs might be able to fight Thrune and win. He’s holed up in his inner sanctum on
the second floor, though exceptionally stealthy PCs might be able to catch him
sleeping in his room. He’s a tough fight on par with the other boss battles in
this dungeon, but he’s definitely defeatable.</p>

<p>The problem is he’s nearly <em>unkillable</em>. The same infernal pact that lets him
survive without a heart also make him supernaturally resilient to HP damage. He
can keep operating normally until reduced from 206 all the way to -24 HP, after
which he becomes stunned. The stun only clears if he’s healed to above -24 HP,
but he does have access to a class ability that gives him fast healing and he
uses that at the start of every fight.</p>

<p>There are two ways to kill him for real: total bodily destruction, or a certain
set of insta-death or soul-trapping spells.</p>

<p>The first happens “naturally” if you get him to -191 HP (!) via standard damage
sources, basically turning his body into hamburger. It also happens if you hit
him with Destruction or Disintegrate spells when he’s below -24.</p>

<p>The second consists of spells like <em>flesh to stone</em>, <em>soul jar</em>, and other such
magic that bypasses damage reduction. This triggers a clause in his infernal
contract that kills him instantly to prevent capture.</p>

<p>Killing Barzilai here will prevent a later battle with him and will give the PCs
early access to a vital plot coupon, but it’s perfectly possible to bypass the
guy entirely. Given what awaits the PCs in the belfry, avoiding Thrune to
preserve resources is an equally valid choice as killing him early.</p>

<h3 id="raiding-the-profane-belfry">Raiding the Profane Belfry</h3>

<p>The dungeon is set up so that this is the last thing you do regardless of the
path you took through the Temple. It’s not an optional goal, and it’s no simple
victory lap either - it’s the <em>real</em> final boss fight for the Temple of
Asmodeus.</p>

<p>The belfry can only be accessed via the hole on the roof of the nave, which only
“unlocks” once both infernal engines have been deactivated. There are no
stairs - you need flight or teleport magic to get there. A couple of magical
traps lie in wait just past the lip of the hole. And then there are the
guardians: four powerful undead with an even stronger leader, all former priests
of Aroden.</p>

<p>The leader can and will ring one of the bells with his mind as a free action
every round, causing an effect much more powerful than the ones the party has
been experiencing so far. A Silence spell will prevent this, but will also
prevent the PCs from casting most spells too.</p>

<h3 id="hells-bells">Hell’s Bells</h3>

<p>Once all guardians are destroyed, it’s time to exorcise the bells. The procedure
for this is quite elaborate and it’s definitely something I’d allow the PCs to
easily find out via prior research, because if they find themselves unprepared
here the whole raid was for nothing. They’re going to need to at least one
scroll of Hallow and five of Dispel Evil, though I’d also recommend multiple
spares for each one. Preparing these spells also works, of course, but it eats
into the number of slots they have available for the fights in the temple.</p>

<p>Steps 1 and 2 are disabling the infernal engines and killing the guardians. Done
and done.</p>

<p>Step 3 is casting a Hallow spell on the belfry, or a Consecrate spell on each
of the five bells.</p>

<p>Step 4 is drumming the chorus to the Song of Silver on one of the bells, which
requires a trivial Performance check.</p>

<p>Step 5 is casting Dispel Evil on the same bell within a minute of drumming the
chorus on it. This causes the bell to begin glowing. A PC must then touch the
bell within 3 rounds (18 seconds). This will plunge the PC into a semi-real
vision related to the bell’s nature, and if the PC can endure and overcome the
vision, the bell is exorcised.</p>

<p>Failure to perform the song’s chorus, to enter the vision in time, or to
overcome the vision causes the bell to ring a discordant note that dispels the
Hallow effect and possibly summons a devil. The PCs must fight the monster and
begin the process anew from step 3.</p>

<p>For each vision, the GM describes the scene, lets the player describe their PCs
reaction to it, and then asks for a roll to overcome the ordeal. Good
roleplaying on the part of the PC can give a +5 on the roll. Success exorcises
the bell, failure deals ability drain and resets the procedure as above. The GM
should tailor the vision to the PC. Here’s a summary of the visions and their
tests:</p>

<p><strong>Bell of Torments</strong>: The PC is being tormented in Hell by an enemy that
particularly vexed them in the past. After a while they realize they are holding
their favorite weapon, and can strike at their tormentor. <em>Test</em>: Attack roll
vs. AC 28.</p>

<p><strong>Bell of Slaves</strong>: The PC is enslaved to a cruel master (someone who lorded
over them in the past), working on a grueling task. They must either tough it
out, escape their bonds, or stand up to their overlord. <em>Test</em>: Player’s choice
of Fort, Ref, or Will vs. DC 21.</p>

<p><strong>Bell of Pride</strong>: The PC is called before one of the gods to display their
skill or craft. Failing the test turns the vision into one of
humiliation. <em>Test</em>: A Craft, Perform, or Knowledge skill test vs. DC 30.</p>

<p><strong>Bell of Tyrants</strong>: The PC is the defendant in a trial where Barzilai is the
judge, and the PC’s friends and allies jeer at them from the crowd. The PC must
mound a successful defense. At the end of the trial, the crowd riots; on a
success, they tear the judge apart, on a failure they do it to the PC. <em>Test</em>:
A social skill vs. DC 30.</p>

<p><strong>Bell of Infernal Darkness</strong>: The PC is sharing a happy moment with a loved
one, when suddenly the <em>entire world</em> becomes a giant Barzilai Thrune with a
black hole where his heart should be. The PC must lead the loved one away from
danger through a shifting surreal landscape. <em>Test</em>: A movement skill
vs. DC 30.</p>

<p>These tests seem to be calibrated so that only the PC most specialized in that
skill has a decent chance of success, so unless the GM is very cruel I’d
recommend giving advance warning that a different PC must touch each bell and
throwing the PC in question straight into the vision they are most likely to
overcome.</p>

<h3 id="concluding-the-raid">Concluding the Raid</h3>

<p>Once all bells have been properly exorcised, the temple can be considered
cleared. Any remaining defenders, including Barzilai himself, either flee or get
banished back to hell if they were summoned creatures. The party has some time
to finish looting the temple as well.</p>

<p>We’ll look at what happens after they leave in the next post.</p>

<p>The first three volumes of this adventure path were dedicated to building up the
Silver Ravens and their rebellion. Strikes against Thrune were indirect and
targeted peripheral facilities, which prevented the enemy from mounting a big
response.</p>

<p>All of this changes at the very end of Adventure 03, where Barzilai lays a
deadly trap for the PCs and potentially kills a lot of innocents. At the start
of this one, Barzilai Thrune makes his final three proclamations: he outlaws the
Silver Ravens, he forbids worship of any god that’s not Asmodeus, and he
blockades the bridge that separates the two halves of the city. As soon as this
happens, his forces begin a brutal series of reprisals against the Ravens and
the population in general.</p>

<p>The Silver Ravens immediately begin to fight back, since at this point their
rebellion has reached its maximum power and anyone who was even a little
sympathetic to them throws their full support behind the organization.</p>

<p>In summary, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzNs4-kRLaE">shit’s going down</a>.</p>

<p>PCs start this adventure at level 10 and are expected to finish halfway into
level 13.</p>

<h2 id="gming-the-rebellion">GMing the Rebellion</h2>

<p>The bulk of this adventure is dedicated to commanding the full might of the
rebellion to topple Barzilai Thrune. While you might have been able to ignore
the custom rebellion rules up until now, they’re unavoidable here. If you didn’t
bother with them before the book suggests assigning a default set of stats for
the organization (Notoriety 75%, focused stat +15, secondary stats +10). Those
numbers are higher than what’s on the Player Guide, probably to account for
bonuses the PCs would have gotten if they kept track of things in detail. Even
if you were using detailed rules before I recommend upgrading the org’s stats to
at least that level.</p>

<p>Now that Thrune’s government can be “killed”, it gets stats of its own. The
important one is Authority, which must be brought down to 0 for the Ravens to
win. When that happens, Thrune and his remaining lackeys lock themselves up in
the Temple of Asmodeus for a last-ditch desperation move, and the PCs can get at
them with a final assault.</p>

<p>The PCs and the Silver Ravens fight the Thrune government by completing
missions. These usually involve raids against important facilities controlled by
named villains. Success at these usually removes whatever capabilities that
villain brought into play, and gives the Silver Ravens control of the city
district they’re in. Districts under Raven control become safe from patrols and
such, and lower both current and maximum Authority by a certain amount (10 or 20
points, depending on the district). This is why I linked the Assassin’s Creed:
Brotherhood trailer above.</p>

<p>Thrune’s government tries to resist the rebellion through brutal reprisals
against the Ravens and the population in general. They can launch one such
reprisal per day for every 25 Authority or fraction thereof they have. Specific
reprisals are rolled out of a d100 table. The best possible result here is “No
Reprisal”, an organizational snafu that actually decreases Thrune’s
Authority. The other events result from mere defamation or increased patrols all
the way to a dragon air strike, each one increasing Authority by an amount
proportional to its badness. As Authority drops and named villains are killed,
some of these entries will be removed and replaced with No Reprisal. Can’t have
a dragon attack if the dragon is dead! Authority also increased by 1d6 at the
start of every day, to represent the population’s and the Ravens’ war weariness.</p>

<p>The problem with those reprisal events is that they also kill some of the city’s
population. While the chance that the PCs will lose the game at this stage is
small, they must act quickly and forcefully to prevent Thrune from doing too
much damage to the city they’re trying to protect.</p>

<p>Authority starts at 100 by default, but past Silver Raven victories in previous
adventures can reduce this starting amount. A “perfect run” means allying with
both the sea elves and Vyre; destroying Menador keep <em>and</em> stealing the
documents kept there; and finishing the Ruby Masquerade with 20 or more Masque
Points. This would mean Thrune starts this adventure with Authority at 65/100,
giving the PCs a major starting advantage.</p>

<h2 id="the-missions">The Missions</h2>

<p>The default expectation here is that the PCs managed to win the battle at the
opera house and fully explore it at the end of the last adventure. If this is
the case, the adventure starts with an emergency meeting of the Silver Council
taking place as soon as the PCs are recovered, to update them on the state of
the rebellion and explain the available district control missions.</p>

<p>If on the other hand the PCs <em>lost</em> the opera house battle, they wake up in a
cell in Kintargo Keep, and must escape. They basically tackle the hardest
mission first, from the inside out, and then add the Opera House to their to-do
list later - it’s still full of stuff vital to their success.</p>

<p>Most of the missions consist of relatively short dungeon raids that are
essentially big set-piece battles against the villain of the hour and their
minions. These encounters tend to all be CR 13. This is where the game
introduces a new monster type, the Troop, which works a lot like a 4e Swarm but
occupies an area that’s more “malleable” than the standard square. There are
Dottari and Inquisitor troops here, representing the fact that Thrune’s security
forces are out in well, force.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, PCs can order the Ravens to perform support actions before
every dungeon raid instead of just at the end of every week. If the named
villains in each one manage to survive and escape, they’ll likely join Thrune at
the Temple of Asmodeus. Even if this happens, they still count as defeated for
district-taking purposes.</p>

<p>This is the mission list:</p>

<h3 id="rescue-hetamon-jarvis-end-district">Rescue Hetamon (Jarvis End District)</h3>

<p>Hetamon Haace is the Rose of Kintargo. He became an ally and a member of the
Silver Council back in adventure 02, but is missing from this adventure’s
emergency meeting. Finding him is a priority.</p>

<p>Turns out he’s been kidnapped by his evil half-succubus sorceress of a mother,
who is holed up in the basement of Shensen’s former home and plans to sell him
to Thrune in exchange for some sort of cushy job or at least a license to hunt
people in Kintargo. She has a bevy of minions both voluntary and enslaved. The
former consist of a covey of hags; some of the latter can be freed instead of
fought.</p>

<p>Shensen can give the PCs the full layout of her own basement, of course. And if
she comes along the PCs might also recruit her best friend who is hiding in
there, a sapient dinosaur rogue!</p>

<p>Completing this one and reconsecrating the basement as a shrine to Sarenrae
gives PCs control of Jarvis End.</p>

<h3 id="take-the-records-hall-the-greens-district">Take the Records Hall (The Greens District)</h3>

<p>The Records Hall is full of important information about the city and its
inhabitants, and denying this to Thrune will be a major blow to his forces. It’s
also the current lair of Tiarise Izoni, the witch responsible for most
atrocities of an arcane nature committed so far in the campaign. Opposition here
consists of the witch, two inquisitor troops, and two invisible stalkers.</p>

<p>Tiarise’s notes can give the PCs clues about Thrune’s ultimate plan for
immortality, and also alert them to the fact she has performed a ritual on
herself that will turn her into a powerful undead creature when she dies. Unless
she is killed under specific circumstances, Tiarise returns in the last
adventure in undead form as one of its named villains.</p>

<h3 id="bleakbridge-yolubilis-harbor-district">Bleakbridge (Yolubilis Harbor District)</h3>

<p>The bridge is blockaded by a huge force of dottari (three troops, two captains,
a named commander). They’re being helped by a gang of tengu named the River
Talons, who are acting as lookouts. Fortunately, their alliance is shaky and the
Talons’ leader is the brother of Silver Council Member Chok (a weapon shop owner
who joins at the start of this adventure). If the PCs can arrange a meeting
between Chok and his brother, the latter can be convinced to betray the
dottari. In that case, the Talons will not raise the alarm when the PCs sneak
into the bridge, and will take care of one of the dottari troops “offscreen”.</p>

<p>Sneaking into the bridge is possible at all because it’s huge - there are
actually buildings on both sides, with plenty of space to cross in the middle.</p>

<h3 id="skinsaw-assassins-villegre-or-redroof-districts">Skinsaw Assassins (Villegre or Redroof Districts)</h3>

<p>These cultists are led by Hei-fen, the spiteful and vengeful wererat who has it
in for the PCs. The PCs are warned about them by Molly Mayapple, the helpful and
grateful wererat from Vyre.</p>

<p>The cultists will attack the PCs in three separate occasions, possibly while
they’re busy with something else. The first strike is six cultists, the second
one a jorogumo, and the final one another twelve cultists, another jorogumo, and
Hei-fen herself. They’re also doing murders for Thrune on the side.</p>

<p>Eliminating all of them changes the corresponding reprisal table entry to “No
Reprisal”, and gives the city enough breathing room for the PCs to take control
of either Villegre or Redroof.</p>

<h3 id="kintargo-keep-castle-district">Kintargo Keep (Castle District)</h3>

<p>This is where Thrune’s most important political prisoners are being kept. If the
PCs have been captured at the end of the last adventure, they start here and
must escape. Otherwise, this will probably be the last place they hit. The keep
and castle are much less guarded than usual because Barzilai ordered most of the
troops stationed here to go out and hunt for the PCs, which ironically lets them
approach the Keep.</p>

<p>While the tower has five levels, only the ground floor and basement are truly
relevant. When the PCs attack the tower is being guarded by six Hellknights of
the Rack and their leader, Paralictor Kyrre Ekodyre. The knights should spot the
PCs as soon as they make it past the door, so they will eventually need to deal
with all of them and the paralictor in the same fight. There are some undead
knights possessing suits of armor guarding a shrine, but they will not join the
main fight unless disturbed.</p>

<p>The keep’s archives contain the contracts Barzilai made with the order of the
Rack, to transfer all of the assets of the Order of the Torrent to them (back in
adventure 02). Turns out there are a lot of irregularities in these contracts
that make them illegal. The Hellknights, who are Lawful-Eviler-than-thou, will
abandon Thrune once these documents are made public. This will remove them from
all random and pre-arranged encounters!</p>

<p>The archives also contain prisoner records showing that Jackdaw, the original
leader of the Silver Ravens, is still here! House Thrune’s redaction efforts
were so effective that not even Barzilai or the knights remember why she was
important.</p>

<p>Jackdaw is being held in a special cell in the basement, behind a secret
door. She’s guarded by a being known as the First Warden, a former warpriest of
Asmodeus who was turned into a lich and bound to this prison as a punishment for
some forgotten transgression. The Warden will at first attempt to talk to the
PCs because it’s been a long time since she had a proper conversation, but will
attack when she realizes they’re here to free Jackdaw. She has a lot of priestly
abilities and the help of four more of those possessed armors.</p>

<p>Jackdaw is in a pretty sorry state - the lich has kept her from dying, but
hasn’t done anything to make her comfortable. Once the PCs restore her health
and sanity, she becomes a very valuable ally. She can also supply them with the
lyrics for the Song of Silver, which combined with the score from the opera
house allows the PCs to use the ritual.</p>

<h3 id="the-dragon-villegre-or-redroof-district">The Dragon (Villegre or Redroof District)</h3>

<p>I did mention a dragon, didn’t I? She’s an adult blue dragon named Rivozair. She
first attacked the city during the Chelish civil war, and was nearly killed by
the original Silver Ravens. Rivozair returned shortly before the campaign
started and agreed to join up with Barzilai for a chance to take revenge on the
city. He invested her with additional infernal power, binding her to a horned
devil in the same way Nox from Adventure 01 was bound to a bearded one.</p>

<p>Rivozair is a powerhouse of a solo boss, and one of Barzilai’s most powerful
minions. In addition to her usual “I’m a dragon!” suite of abilities, her
lightning breath has been replaced with hellfire, she can summon barbed devils,
and she has Regeneration 5 that can only be overcome by Good-aligned spells and
weapons (though that last bit shouldn’t be a problem at this point). After the
PCs finish the other five missions, or after they reduce Barzilai’s Authority to
0 (whatever happens first), the dragon will be unleashed to hunt down and kill
the PCs directly.</p>

<p>If the GM wants to make this battle a bit easier, they can have some of the PC’s
allies help in the fight. If on the other hand they want to make it harder, they
can have the dragon begin its hunt earlier than scheduled. Rivozair will try to
become invisible and run away when she’s badly wounded, but instead of rallying
at the Temple she will flee the region. She might come back to disrupt the
victory celebration, if the GM wishes. Otherwise she will remove herself from
the campaign.</p>

<p>Defeating Rovizair removes her entry from the reprisal table… but more
importantly it <em>instantly reduces Authority to 0</em>. I guess any remaining minions
will see that the PCs can handle the dragon and will immediately leave their
posts as if they had been defeated, rallying at the Temple of Asmodeus. We now
enter the final stage of the adventure.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>And that brings this post to a close. There’s actually little I would cut from
this part of the adventure, since all of the fights here seem pretty cool. When
playing in Pathfinder, they are also quite amenable to alpha-strike tactics.</p>

<p>In the next post, we’ll take a look at the effects of the Song of Silver and at
the Temple of Asmodeus, which unlike these short raids is a huge grinding slog.</p>
