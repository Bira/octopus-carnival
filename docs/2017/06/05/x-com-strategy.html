<p>The intrepid soldiers of my <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">X-COM campaign</a> have just completed their second
field op and returned alive but not unharmed. They discovered and explored a
huge Forest of Woe in southeastern Brazil, met a new and more dangerous type of
enemy, and brought back what seems to be an alien defector.</p>

<p>At this point I once again invited the players to step out of character for a
while, and we entered the game’s second strategic/research phase. The bonus
event they got this time was a debriefing of the alien refugee, because Sokolov
was their head scientist. Had it been one of the others, this would have been a
normal research choice and would cost points.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-event-the-refugee">Bonus Event: The Refugee</h2>

<p>The alien is around 1.5m tall, and quite skinny. Its body is covered in a dark
purple, chitinous carapace, over which it wears clothes. It has four arms and
two legs, and moves in a somewhat discomforting and “twitchy” fashion. Its seems
to wear a mask, as there is a clear seam between its face and the rest of its
head, but this “mask” is soft and warm and almost human-like, and moves like it
was a natural face. It’s a strong royal blue in color. The alien’s eyes are
yellow with black pupils, and it has a very pronounced nose. This being does not
have a gender as humans conceive of the concept.</p>

<p>As a genderless alien who wants to come and meet us, it was inevitable that the
refugee would receive the code-name of Ziggy (from David Bowie’s Ziggy
Stardust). Despite Dr. Vahlen’s strenuous protests, Dr. Sokolov elected to
debrief X-COM’s new guest by personally interviewing Ziggy, since it was capable
of communicating in English.</p>

<p>Ziggy’s use of grammar was quite peculiar, and it refused to use the pronoun
“I”. Sokolov soon found out the movements of its mouth didn’t match what it
seemed to be saying, and recordings of the interview only showed it speaking the
same alien language the PCs had heard over their comms multiple times. As a
result, the interviews were all transcribed the old-fashioned way, using the
services of a stenographer.</p>

<p>Ziggy gave X-COM some basic organizational information on their opposition: they
were made up of multiple alien species, some from previously conquered worlds
and some engineered for war. The leaders of this force called themselves the
Ebon Masters, and arrived on Earth through “gates”. The trees were part of a
weaponized, artificial ecosystem it called “The Moon Flower”. Ziggy had been
only a civilian clerk in the employ of the Masters, so he wasn’t able to provide
much in the way of specific strategic detail.</p>

<p>Ziggy also referred to something called “The One Power” several times, and said
none of the species previously conquered by the Masters had such an advanced
mastery of it. Figuring that misunderstanding out quickly revealed that the
advanced alien technology on display so far was, in fact, magic, and that humans
were totally ignorant of it. Ziggy became as fascinated by this revelation as
Sokolov was about the existence of magic.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the alien Masters, Ziggy’s look and culture are a mashup of the
original Ethereals from X-COM and the devils from the
excellent <a href="http://killsixbilliondemons.com/">Kill Six Billion Demons</a> comic. It’s the equivalent of a Blue
Devil, so low-ranked but quite intelligent. Ziggy also has a <em>conscience</em>, which
makes it nearly unique among its species.</p>

<p>The whole “friendly alien helps X-COM” idea sprung from a My Little Pony fanfic,
of all places. That story is <a href="https://www.fimfiction.net/story/100455/stardust">here</a> if you’re curious, and though it becomes
a bit muddled later on its premise was interesting enough that I decided to
recycle it with a more campaign-appropriate alien.</p>

<h2 id="research-options">Research Options</h2>

<p>This time, the players had 2 research points to allocate. Their options were the
following, with the ones in italics being new:</p>

<p><strong>Cutting-Edge Research</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Advanced Medkit (this was Vahlen’s “free” project”) 0/1</li>
  <li>Personal-scale combat drones (this was Shen’s “free” project) 0/1</li>
  <li><em>Project Stardust</em> (Employ Ziggy as part of the research staff and harness the
One Power) 0/2</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alien Artifacts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Pinnochio (Puppet of Ruin) corpse 0/1</li>
  <li>Rosie (Bakegumo) corpse 0/1</li>
  <li>Alien guns 0/1</li>
  <li>Alien swords 0/1
 -Alien Explosives (from grenades/RPG rounds) 0/1</li>
  <li><em>Black Trees</em> (Study those substantial Black Tree pieces) 0/1</li>
  <li><em>Red Dust</em> (It’s sprinkled over every alien body and artifact, as you’ve
discovered earlier) 0/1</li>
</ul>

<p>The group discussed this for a while. Two new players had joined the group at
this time, and they provided their input as well. In the end, Project Stardust
won out. It was the equivalent of researching psionics in the computer games,
and it was even more vital here than in the original material.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-power-setting-information">The One Power: Setting Information</h2>

<p>What Ziggy called “The One Power” is the ability to cause direct changes to
physical reality by visualizing them in extreme detail and willing them into
existence. It’s called that by the Ebon Masters because they never before had
encountered a civilization that managed to achieve more than a medieval level of
technology without resorting to it.</p>

<p>Ziggy’s description of the theoretical underpinnings of the One Power match a
lot of human occult lore, sharing several similarities with Kabbalah and
Pythagorean numerology among other sources. Manifesting a given effect requires
modeling it through an equation in the alien numerological system, and then
repeatedly solving it in one’s mind. Using it in practice requires more than an
active imagination and skill at mathematics, however!</p>

<p>Medical scans show Ziggy’s body is permeated by an extensive network of
circuit-like metallic filaments, made from the same materials detected in the
tree fragments. These are naturally occurring in every species capable of using
the One Power, according to the alien. These “circuits” act as a conduit for it,
and take on some of the work of processing those mental equations.</p>

<p>Once X-COM’s scientists and engineers figured out the basics of how all of that
works, they realized it wasn’t much different from modeling a physical process
in software. With this knowledge in hand, they were able to separate the steps
of building the necessary model (“compilation”) and running its simulation
enough times to manifest the effect (“execution”). Sokolov didn’t like calling
these things “spells”, so he named them “metatronic loops” to make the whole
thing sound more scientific.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-power-game-mechanics">The One Power: Game Mechanics</h2>

<p>Behind the scenes, the One Power as used by the aliens is basically Ritual Path
Magic from <strong>GURPS Monster Hunters 1: Champions</strong> and <strong>GURPS Thaumathology:
Ritual Path Magic</strong>. The main break from those supplements is that the aliens
are able to use it to create permanent items and constructs, which is where all
the “TL 4+n” stuff comes from.</p>

<p>The bit about naturally occurring “magic circuits” is swiped from the <em>Fate</em>
franchise; their game effect here is to allow a character to buy Magery (Ritual
Path) and Ritual Adept. Humans in this game lack these circuits and so can’t use
“classic” RPM at all. However, this discovery allows them to build similar
circuits into <em>computers</em>, giving them access to the Technomagic variant from
<strong>GURPS Monster Hunters 5: Applied Xenology</strong>.</p>

<p>The immediate game effect of this discovery was to add a new item to the group’s
master equipment list: the Metatronic Device, a hardened, custom-made PDA that
could store one metatronic loop in its memory and run it at the tap of an
icon. The thing’s processor would burn out after the effect ended, but it would
be possible to carry several of them into the field. The first loop available
was one that completely protected everyone in a given radius from the Hostage
Effect (AKA psychic numbness) for up to 6 hours.</p>

<p>Players can also elect to learn ritual magic paths from now on - once they do,
they’ll be able to develop their own loops using the top-of-the-line setup at
X-COM HQ and take them into the field using the PDAs. For now they’re limited to
what the NPC scientists can make.</p>

<p>Another, less visible effect of the discovery was to give X-COM access to the
magical side of every other discovery they made through research! This is why
researching the One Power was so vital - every possible countermeasure for the
Dreams of Ruin involves a healthy dose of magic, particularly the higher-end
ones. They couldn’t arrive at any of those solutions without this knowledge.</p>

<p>Once the choice was made and the effects explained, I took a little time to come
up with their next mission. In the next update to this series, we’ll begin
covering Operation SNAKE OIL.</p>
