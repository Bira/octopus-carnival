<p>This is the fourth post of a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to
<strong>GURPS</strong>. Previous posts can be found below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/07/human-enemies.html">Humans</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/14/goblins.html">Goblins</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/17/wolves.html">Wolves</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Saurians are the least populous of the three sapient species inhabiting the
Gransys peninsula. They are less technically sophisticated than humans but
require little in the way of tools due to their great strength and
hardiness. And while they’re not nearly as malicious as goblins, they’re
fiercely territorial and have no qualms about eating any trespassers.</p>

<p>A Saurian’s body is densely muscled and covered in scales similar to a
crocodile’s in texture. Their heads resemble those of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogona">bearded dragons</a>, and
their mouths are filled with sharp teeth. A Saurian is able to walk upright not
just because of its roughly humanoid limbs, but because of its thick tail that
acts as a counterweight and shifts its center of mass backwards. The final
result makes even a burly human warrior look rather puny.</p>

<p>Saurians live in small bands humans call “basks” for their tendency to be found
basking in the sun. They reproduce by laying large eggs with soft, slimy
shells that require constaint moisture, which means basks often claim territory
near large bodies of water.</p>

<p>Saurians fight using crude spears and polearms sized for their large
frames. These and the occasional rawhide satchel are the most sophisticated
tools any human has seen them use. Those experienced in fighting them know to
sever the tail: it can be targeted from the side or behind at a -2 penalty. Like
the tail of certain mundane lizards, it comes off easily: injury over HP/2 is
enough to sever it, which means the Saurian is unable to stand upright. This
doesn’t reduce its movement, but it <em>does</em> mean it can only use its natural
weapons to fight.</p>

<p>Saurians in this state will usually try to flee the battle. The tail grows back
in time even if severed!</p>

<p>Below are descriptions of all species of saurian found in the original game and
its expansion. They are meant to be worthy challenges to 250-point delvers,
which makes them quite scary for less powerful characters.</p>

<h2 id="common-saurian">Common Saurian</h2>

<p>The most commonly found variety of Saurian is a dark brownish green in color,
and conforms exactly to the general description above. They are cold-blooded,
and thus tend to keep to Gransys’ warmer southern reaches.</p>

<p>In the original game, there was a sizable group of them living in a flooded
seaside cave underneath Cassardis, complete with a large amount of eggs.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 15; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>Parry</strong> 11U (dueling glaive); <strong>DR</strong> 4 (Tough Skin);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 15; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)</strong>: 1d+4 imp or 2d+4 cut, Reach 1,2*.</li>
  <li><strong>Claw or Bite (14)</strong>: 1d cut. The bite benefits from <em>Born Biter</em> (<strong>DF 3</strong>,
p. 15).</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Swipe (12)</strong>: 1d+1 cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); DR 4 (Tough Skin); Peripheral Vision;
Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp); Terrain Adaptation (Swamp);
Bestial; Cold-Blooded 2; Social Stigma (Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.</p>

<h2 id="sulfur-saurian">Sulfur Saurian</h2>

<p>This species of Saurian is so named for the color of their scales, which are
black with bright yellow streaks. They are a little more tolerant of the cold
than Common Saurians, and thus live further north. They share the same general
traits described above, and possess two other remarkable abilities: they can
shift the color of their scales to match their surroundings, and they can spit
paralytic venom!</p>

<p>Basks of Sulfur Saurians are common on the margins of the river crossing the
Cursewood in central Gransys and on the warm waters of Lake Hardship, being one
of the reasons for the lake’s name.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 17; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>Parry</strong> 11U (dueling glaive); <strong>DR</strong> 4 (Tough Skin);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 17; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)</strong>: 1d+5 imp or 2d+5 cut, Reach
1,2*. Often laced with the poison described below.</li>
  <li><strong>Claw or Bite (14)</strong>: 1d+1 cut. The bite benefits from <em>Born Biter</em> (<strong>DF
3</strong>, p. 15) and from the poison described below.</li>
  <li><strong>Poison Spit (12)</strong>: HT to resist; failure entails a non-cumulative -3 to DX
and IQ for 1 hour. Acc 3, Range 10.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Swipe (12)</strong>: 1d+2 cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); Chameleon 4; DR 4 (Tough Skin);
Peripheral Vision; Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp); Terrain
Adaptation (Swamp); Bestial; Cold-Blooded 1; Social Stigma (Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.</p>

<h2 id="geo-saurian">Geo Saurian</h2>

<p>This species has even stronger than a normal saurian, and has more clearly
supernatural traits. Their scales are black with small red streaks, and have a
metallic cast to them. Like sulfur saurians, they can change their coloration to
match the environment and have dangerous spit. Unlike sulfur saurians, their
sticky spit is <em>flaming</em>, not poisonous.</p>

<p>Geo Saurians can only be found on volcanic mountains or near active geothermal
vents. The most well-known concentration of these features is the Tainted
Mountain, which lies in the monster-infested range west of Gransys’s
borders. That’s not to say they couldn’t be found within some deep dungeon that
also had these features, along with other fire-themed beasts!</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 20; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 8; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 10; <strong>Parry</strong> 12U (dueling glaive); <strong>DR</strong> 7 (Tough Skin);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 20; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 7.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)</strong>: 2d+3 imp or 3d+5 cut, Reach
1,2*.</li>
  <li><strong>Claw or Bite (14)</strong>: 2d-2 cut with linked 1d burning. The bite benefits from
<em>Born Biter</em> (<strong>DF 3</strong>, p. 15).</li>
  <li><strong>Flaming Spit (12)</strong>: 1d burning. Acc 3, Range 10.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Swipe (12)</strong>: 2d cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); Combat Reflexes; Chameleon 4; DR 7 (Tough
Skin); Peripheral Vision; Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp);
Terrain Adaptation (Swamp); Bestial; Cold-Blooded 2; Social Stigma (Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.</p>

<h2 id="saurian-variants">Saurian Variants</h2>

<p>In all cases, the stat blocks above are for <em>average</em> saurians of each
type. The GM is free to increase their skills and attributes to produce
exceptional individuals without any additional justification! A few possible
variants found in the game merit special mention.</p>

<h3 id="giant-saurians">Giant Saurians</h3>

<p>Some saurians reach absurd sizes! Maybe they just never stop growing, or maybe
these have been contaminated by ambient magical energies. Take a normal saurian
and increase its SM to +2; multiply ST by 1.5. Their even bigger weapons add +1
to damage on top of the ST increase. Truly colossal specimens at SM+3, ST x2 and
+2 weapon damage might exist if the GM is feeling particularly sadistic.</p>

<h3 id="pyre-saurians">Pyre Saurians</h3>

<p>Despite their shape, they are not actual saurians, but lizard-shaped elemental
beings of pure fire and magma. Start with the stats for a geo saurian and change
its class to Elemental. Add Injury Tolerance (Homogenous), +2d to the burning
damage from the bite and spit, and a 1d burning emanation in a 2 meter
radius. Fortunately, they use no weapons and always rely on their natural
claws, bite and tail.</p>

<h3 id="saurian-sages">Saurian Sages</h3>

<p>Despite their bestial nature, Saurians do have a mystical tradition centered
around mastering their vulnerability to cold. Those rare individuals who
complete a pilgrimage to the roots of the world are able to master cold itself!
To make a Saurian Sage, start with a normal saurian and remove
Cold-Blooded. Raise IQ to at least 12, and add three or more levels of Water
College Magery or Elemental Empowerment related to water. Give them any
appropriate ice-themed spells or elementalist powers you wish. If starting from
a geo saurian, their burning spit becomes freezing instead: it still does
burning damage, but it’s no longer incendiary.</p>

<h3 id="variant-stacking">Variant Stacking</h3>

<p>“Pyre Saurian” and “Saurian Sage” are incompatible with each other. You won’t
even find individuals of both types working together! However, both variants
<em>are</em> compatible with the “Giant” upgrade, and combining them can give you
something not entirely unlike a dragon.</p>
