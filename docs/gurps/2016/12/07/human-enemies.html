<p>This post is part of a series on converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy</strong>. Please go <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/06/enemies-overview.html">here</a> for links to all other posts in the
series. The first “monster family” I’m covering here is good old humanity! You
might say they’re not monsters, but you should see what they get up to from time
to time.</p>

<p>Joking aside, human opposition can be easily built using the 62- and 125-point
templates from <strong>DF 15</strong>, or the full PC templates from the other books for
leaders or particularly skilled individuals. The ready-made henchthing templates
from <strong>Mirror of the Fire Demon</strong> are also appropriate.</p>

<p>Human opponents come in several forms, with the most common discussed below. The
writeups focus on combat skills and tactics - feel free to add any other skills
and traits appropriate to the specific characters you wish to include in your
games.</p>

<h2 id="bandits">Bandits</h2>

<p>A <em>bandit</em> or <em>brigand</em> is someone who hides out in the wilderness and makes a
living robbing passing travelers. People can turn to banditry for a variety of
reasons. Some are civilians made destitute by a natural disaster and see no
other option. Some have been convicted of crimes that would see them dead anyway
if they showed their face anywhere civilized. Some, like Robin Hood’s merry men,
might use banditry as a way to undermine a ruler they oppose. And some just like
killing people and taking their stuff.</p>

<p>Bandits are never encountered alone - they always bring a few buddies to better
shank you with. While usually not very skilled as individuals, they’re clever
about picking their battles and only attack when they think they can win. Bandit
gangs range from a handful of thugs living in a small forest camp to a large and
well-organized unit in a fortified position. These hidden bases are always
relatively close to a road or settlement, which provides the gang with their
main source of targets.</p>

<p>Unless a victim looks important enough to be worth ransoming, Gransys bandits
don’t usually take prisoners. The dead tell no tales! If a potential victim
looks too tough to take on, they either leave or try to negotiate if that is not
an option.</p>

<p>The three largest bandit gangs in Gransys are the Iron Hammers, who occupy the
ruins of Aernst Castle to the south; the all-female Labrys Bandits who occupy
the ruins of Heavenspeak Castle to the northwest; and a large but nameless band
of smugglers holed up in the canyons between Windbluff and Bluemoon towers.</p>

<h3 id="bandit-strider">Bandit Strider</h3>

<p>Most bandits are archers or light skirmishers. They prefer to shoot at targets
from high ground and will only draw their swords as a last resort. They are
usually fodder, though more powerful examples exist.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 12; <strong>DX</strong> 11; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>Parry</strong> 8 (shortsword); <strong>DR</strong> 2.</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 12; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 12;</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 6.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bow (13)</strong>: 1d imp. Acc 2.</li>
  <li><strong>Cheap Shortsword (11)</strong>: 1d imp or 1d+2 cut.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Callous, Code of Honor (Pirate’s), Greed.</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Regular bow, hip quiver with 20 arrows, Medium Hardened Leather
armor, cheap shortsword.</p>

<h3 id="bandit-bouncer">Bandit Bouncer</h3>

<p>These hardier sorts prefer the personal touch. Their job is to keep the targets
too busy to get to the archers and spellcasters. They are usually worthies.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 14; <strong>DX</strong> 13; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 10 (11); <strong>Parry</strong> 10 (11) (broadsword); <strong>DR</strong> 3 (2 vs crushing).</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 14; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 12;</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 6.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cheap Thrusting Broadsword (15)</strong>: 1d+2 imp or 2d+1 cut.</li>
  <li><strong>Shield Slam (15)</strong>: 1d cr.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Combat Reflexes, High Pain Threshold, Bully, Bloodlust, Code of Honor
(Pirate’s), Greed.</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Cheap thrusting broadsword, small shield (DB 1), Jack of Plates,
leather pot-helm.</p>

<h3 id="bandit-caster">Bandit Caster</h3>

<p>The brains of the outfit, they hang back with the archers and cast debilitating
spells. They are usually worthies.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 10; <strong>DX</strong> 11; <strong>IQ</strong> 14; <strong>HT</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 8; <strong>Parry</strong> 11 (Staff).</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 5; <strong>Move</strong> 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Staff (12)</strong>: 1d+2 cr. Enchanted with the Staff spell.</li>
  <li><strong>Fireball (14)</strong>: 1d or 2d burning, costs 1 or 2 FP.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Spells</strong>: Itch-14, Spasm-14, Clumsiness-14, Hinder-14, Debility-14, Create
Fire-14, Shape Fire-14, Fireball-14, Foolishness-14, Daze-14.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Magery 2, Psychic Guidance (fireball), Bully, Callous, Code of Honor
(Pirate’s), Greed.</p>

<h2 id="guards-and-soldiers">Guards and Soldiers</h2>

<p>These make up the rank-and-file of an organized fighting force. Most are
<em>retainers</em> in the service of a noble or wealthy merchant. They can also be
<em>mercenaries</em>, working for anyone who can pay their fee. The latter aren’t very
popular in Gransys, and are more common in other nations.</p>

<p>They’re built much like bandits, but tend to have better gear and slightly
higher combat skills.</p>

<h3 id="marksman">Marksman</h3>

<p>Marksmen use crossbows, and are trained to form firing lines and fire en
masse. In smaller battles they keep their distance and focus on high-value
targets like magicians.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 13; <strong>DX</strong> 13; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>Parry</strong> 9 (Shortsword); <strong>DR</strong> 4/2*</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 6</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Crossbow (15)</strong>: 1d+4 imp. Acc 4.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Mail Armor, Steel Pot Helm, Shorstsword, Crossbow, Quiver with 20
bolts.</p>

<h3 id="halberdier">Halberdier</h3>

equally useful on and off the battlefield.</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 10; <strong>Parry</strong> 11 (Dueling Halberd); <strong>DR</strong> 5 (torso); 4/2* (elsewhere).</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 14; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 12;</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 6.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dueling Halberd (16)</strong>: 2d+4 cut or 1d+3 imp or 2d+3 imp.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Combat Reflexes, Duty (to Lord).</p>
