<p>Now that we have a <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/17/characters-part-2.html">solid grasp of magic</a> in the world of Dragon’s Dogma, we
can finish our tour of its vocations and how they relate to the templates in
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>. The last big category we have yet to cover are Hybrid
Vocations, which I think are one of the most distinctive aspects of the original
game.</p>

<h2 id="hybrid-vocations-in-dragons-dogma">Hybrid Vocations in Dragon’s Dogma</h2>

<p>Dragon’s Dogma has three <em>hybrid vocations</em>, each of which combines aspects from
two of the color-coded categories we covered back in <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/13/characters.html">Part 1</a>. They are
covered here in a little more detail than the single-color vocations were,
because I feel it’s important to examine how their concepts are executed.</p>

<p>The Red/Yellow vocation is the <em>Assassin</em>. An Assassin can equip all basic “red”
and “yellow” weapons in any combination, which allows them to have a large
number of active special abilities accessible via the equipment menu. These
abilities tend to have involve high mobility and precision damage, with some use
of explosives. An Assassin is <em>versatile</em> and fights by choosing the best weapon
for each opponent and trying to kill them quickly before they can fight back.</p>

<p>The Yellow/Blue vocation is the <em>Magic Archer</em>. They can wear heavier armor than
a pure spellcaster, and since their arrows are made of magic they use no
ammunition. Their abilities add specific elemental and “trick” effects to their
arrows (bouncing on walls, explosions, and so on). They fight mostly by
remaining at range and hitting enemies on their <em>elemental vulnerabilities</em>.</p>

<p>The Red/Blue vocation is the <em>Mystic Knight</em>. Mystic Knights wear heavy armor
and wield one-handed swords or maces paired with large shields. Their abilities
allow them to reflect blocked damage back to the attacker, add elemental damage
to the whole party’s weapons at once, and place damaging mystical sigils on the
ground. They fight by <em>controlling the battlefield</em> and making sure the enemy
suffers for any decision they make.</p>

<h2 id="missing-templates">Missing Templates</h2>

<p>You might have been wondering how the two <strong>DF 1</strong> templates we haven’t
discussed yet fit into this. The short answer is they don’t.</p>

<p><em>Martial Artists</em> would seem like a good example of a Yellow/Blue template, as
they rely on agility and have access to supernatural powers. However, the
template as it stands is tied into the whole “kung-fu” aesthetic, which Dragon’s
Dogma doesn’t really go for. The “exotic but supremely skilled foreign
combatant” niche is better filled by a Swashbuckler wielding fencing weapons.</p>

<p><em>Holy Warriors</em> also seem like a good example of a Red/Blue template, but once
again the Holy Might power implies a strong connection to the divine that
doesn’t match the way magic works in this setting. Changing this template to
match Dragon’s Dogma magic would be more work than it was for the Cleric, and so
it’s better to drop it.</p>

<h2 id="hybrid-templates">Hybrid Templates</h2>

<p>How can we translate the feel of these vocations into Dungeon Fantasy templates?
The obvious way would be to resort to the Mixed Profession lenses from <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level</strong>. Aside from giving players the ability to
combine powers from multiple templates, they also feel like an “advanced option”
for characters with a some experience under their belts, just like their
counterparts in the original game.</p>

<p>The other option would be to create a character from the start using a template
that draws on multiple concepts to inform their abilities. We will also look at
those options here.</p>

<p>A good way to get a versatile, “Assassin”-like character is to add a <em>Scout</em>
lens to a character who started with either the Knight or Swashbuckler
template. Alternatively, you can add the <em>Swashbuckler</em> lens to a Scout, choosing
a melee weapon such as a broadsword. This will leave you with an agile character
who is equally adept at ranged and melee combat. A small investment in the
appropriate Fast-Draw specialties and the Quick-Sheathe perk can ensure you
always have the right weapon on hand.</p>

<p>For a “Magic Archer”-like character, adding the <em>Scout</em> lens to a spellcaster
certainly helps, but the most important bit is the <em>Spell-Archery</em> spell found
in both <strong>DF 3</strong> and <strong>DF 11</strong>. Doing it the other way around (Adding a Wizard
lens to a Scout) is somewhat less efficient but still possible.</p>

<p>Similarly, a “Mystic Knight”-like character could be approximated by either a
Knight with the <em>Wizard</em> lens or a Wizard with the <em>Knight</em> lens. A Cleric with
the <em>Knight</em> or <em>Swashbuckler</em> lens would also work and give us a more balanced
approach.</p>

<p>In both cases, the choices available feel somewhat unsatisfactory, as the end
result doesn’t strike a good enough balance between the physical and magical
sides of the concept.</p>

<p>As an aside, I’m aware that there’s a <em>Mystic Knight</em> template in <strong>Pyramid
#3/13</strong>. Despite the rather fortuitous naming coincidence, I chose not to
include it because it uses Imbuements. While I like the concept of Imbuements, I
don’t like the amount of rolls their implementation adds to the average fight.</p>

<h2 id="new-templates">New Templates!</h2>

<p>So it seems we have two vacancies in our template lineup with the removal of the
Holy Warrior and Martial Artist. Given that the “Mixed Professions” route for
creating a Magic Archer or a Mystic Knight leaves something to be desired, I
feel compelled to bring the number of available templates back to 11 by creating
two entirely new templates for those vocations. This will be the subject of my
next couple of posts.</p>
