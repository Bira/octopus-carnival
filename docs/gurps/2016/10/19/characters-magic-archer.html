<p>As promised, here is the first of the two entirely new templates related to
Dragon’s Dogma. The Magic Archer is meant to combine the archery prowess of a
Scout with the magic of the Wizard in a more balanced way than what is possible
by using “multiclass” lenses.</p>

<h2 id="the-magic-archer-250-points">The Magic Archer (250 points)</h2>

<p>You blend two tricky disciplines into an elegant, pointy whole. You’re almost as
good a shot as any Scout (<strong>DF 1</strong>, p. 10), but you chose to spend the rest of
your time learning the secrets of magic rather than getting lost in the
woods. You trade the Scout’s skill at wilderness survival for the ability to
deliver magical explosions at greater distances than the Wizard (<strong>DF 1</strong>,
p. 15).</p>

<p><strong>Attributes</strong>: ST 12 {20}; DX 13 {60}; IQ 13 {60}; HT 11 {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Characteristics</strong>: Damage 1d-1/1d+2; BL 29 lbs (14.4kg); HP 12 {0};
Will 13 {0}; Per 13 {0}; FP 11 {0}; Basic Speed 6.00 {0}; Basic Move 6 {0}.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Heroic Archer {20} and Magery 3 {35}. • A further 20 points
chosen from among <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/17/characters-part-2.html">Archmagic</a> abilities or ST +1 or +2 {10 or 20 points}, DX
+1 {20}, IQ +1 {20}; HT +1 or +2 {10 or 20}, Will +1 to +4 {5/level}, Born War
Leader 1-4 {5/level}, Combat Reflexes {15}, Eidetic Memory {5} <em>or</em> Photograpic
Memory {10}, Fit {5}, Luck {15}, Magery 4 or 5 {10 or 20}, Night Vision 1-5
{1/level}, Rapid Healing {5}, Signature Gear {Varies}, Weapon Bond {1}, or
Weapon Master (Bow) {20}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: -15 points chosen from among Curious {-5<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>}, Pyromania
{-5<sup id="fnref:1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>}, Callous {-5}, Code of Honor (Pirate’s or Soldiers) {-5 or -10}, Greed
{-15<sup id="fnref:1:2"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>}, Honesty {-10<sup id="fnref:1:3"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>}, or Sense of Duty (Adventuring Companions <em>or</em>
Nation) {-5 or -10}. • Another -35 points chosen from among the previous
traits or Bad Temper {-10<sup id="fnref:1:4"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>}, Frightens Animals {-10}, No Sense of Humor
{-10}, Oblivious {-5}, Odious Personal Habits {-5 to -15}, Overconfidence
{-5<sup id="fnref:1:5"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>}, Social Stigma (Excommunicated) {-5<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup>}, Stubborness {-5}, Unnatural
Features 1-5 {-1/level}, or Weirdness Magnet {-15}</p>

<p><strong>Primary Skills</strong>: Hidden Lore (Demons, Magic Items, Magical Writings, <em>or</em>
Spirits) and Occultism, both (A) IQ {2}-13; Thaumathology (VH) IQ {1}<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup>-13;
• <em>One</em> of these two missile-weapon packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bow (A) DX+3 {12}-16 <em>and</em> Fast-Draw (Arrow) (E) DX+2 {4}-15.</li>
  <li>Bow (A) DX+4 {16}-17.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Secondary Skills</strong>: <em>Eight</em> of Climbing or Stealth, both (A) DX {2}-13;
Armoury (Missile Weapons), Research, Hazardous Materials (Magical), Hidden Lore
(any) or Leadership; all (A) IQ {2}-13; Strategy or Tactics, both (H) IQ-1
{2}-12; or 2 points to raise one of the previous skills by 1.  • Either
Smallsword (A) DX+2 {4}-15 <em>or</em> Staff (A) DX+2 {4}-15.</p>

<p><strong>Background Skills</strong>: <em>Seven</em> of Brawling, Fast-Draw (any), Jumping or Knife,
all (E) DX {1}-13; Boxing, Riding (Horse), or Wrestling, all (A) DX-1 {1} - 12;
First Aid or Gesture, both (E) IQ {1}-13; Cartography or Fast-Talk, both (A)
IQ-1 {1} - 12; Hiking or Running, both (A) HT-1 {1}-10; Intimidation (A) Will-1
{1} - 12; Scrounging (E) Per {1} - 13; Observation or Search, both (A) Per-1
{1} - 12.</p>

<p><strong>Spells</strong>: Spell-Archery (H) IQ+2 {2}<sup id="fnref:2:1"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup>-15; 25 points in wizardly spells,
which will be either (H) IQ+1 {1}-14 or (VH) IQ {1} - 13 with the +3 from
Magery. Some of them may be spent in Archmagic abilities instead.</p>

<h3 id="magic-archers-in-gransys">Magic Archers in Gransys</h3>

<p>Magic Archers are relatively rare in Gransys, as it takes a lot of work to get
this good with both a bow and magic. Noble scions are the ones most likely to
have the necessary time on their hands, though anyone who makes a living
fighting could also acquire the necessary training during their careers. This
includes both knights and bandits!</p>

<p>In campaigns where Status and social position matter, Magic Archers have access
to Status 1 or 2, like knights. And since all magic in Gransys is wizardly in
nature the Social Stigma (Excommunicated) advantage is worth only -5 points.</p>

<h3 id="customization-notes">Customization Notes</h3>

<p>The Magic Archer is about as specialized as the Scout, being built around the
Spell-Archery spell and its prerequisites. A wide spell selection allows for
plenty of diferentiation between characters, and several different avenues
present themselves.</p>

<p><em>Arcane Artillerists</em> blanket the battlefield witht their magic from afar. They
take extra Magery and/or a large Energy Reserve, go for Area spells, and make
frequent use of the fact that attacking an area rather than a person gives +4 to
skill.</p>

<p><em>Sorcerous Snipers</em> focus on eliminating high-value targets. They take Weapon
Master (Bow) to improve their base damage and chose single-target damaging touch
spells to increase it even further.</p>

<p><em>Archer-Commanders</em> go for Born War Leader and choose healing and support spells
to use on allies through boffer arrows (see the Cleric-Scout lens on <strong>DF 3</strong>,
p. 23 ). If using the template on a generic Dungeon Fantasy game, you could
replace Magery 3 {35} with Clerical Investment {5} and Power Investiture 3 {30}
on the template and add an apropriate required disadvantage to make it a Holy
Archer.</p>

<h3 id="magic-archer-power-ups">Magic Archer Power-Ups</h3>

<p>Magic Archers may spend earned points on extra spells and anything on their
template, plus these options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Magery up to 6 {10/level}.</li>
  <li>Any Archmagic abilities.</li>
  <li>Enhanced Tracking (Multiple Lock-Ons, +20%) {6/level}, with <em>no</em> upper
limit.</li>
  <li>Extra Attack 1 {25}.</li>
  <li>Zen Archery <em>without</em> needing Meditation.</li>
  <li>The Double-Shot (<strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 32), Quick-Shot (<strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 33) and
Strongbow (<strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 33) power-ups.</li>
</ul>
