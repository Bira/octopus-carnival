<p>This is the fifth post of a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to
<strong>GURPS</strong>. Previous posts can be found below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/07/human-enemies.html">Humans</a></li>

</ul>

<p>From a distance, harpies look like man-sized owls, with round heads and thick
plumage. Only when they take flight and turn on you is it possible to notice
their human-like faces and upper torsos. These features are invariably those of
women: though there are male harpies, it’s impossible to tell the difference
without dissection.</p>

<p>Harpies also have feminine voices, though they seem to be incapable of verbal
communication. In fact, they behave like large birds of prey, nesting at high
altitudes and ranging far and wide in search of prey. Harpies are full
carnivores and will attack anything that seems meaty enough to sustain them -
even people. They are an ever-present hazard in Gransys’ highlands and mountain
passes.</p>

<p>Note that these harpies are different from the those presented in <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 3: Born of Myth and Magic</strong>. You are free to use those
here as well!</p>

<p>No one has managed to tame a harpy, but those crazy enough to try are willing to
pay handsomely for unhatched eggs. Fetching those would require climbing the
steep crags where they make their nests, a challenging proposition even if one
doesn’t have to contend with a choir of enraged harpies on the way up.</p>

<p>These creatures originally came from beyond the world: ancient accounts of past
draconic invasions report armies of them arriving through the same rift as the
Dragon itself. Several stable populations remain:</p>

<h2 id="brown-harpies">Brown Harpies</h2>

<p>These inhabit the mountain chain separating South and Central Gransys, as well
as the mountains to the soutwest beyond the Shadow Fort. Their skin is an ashen
grey, covered in dark brown feathers.</p>

<p>Brown harpies have innate magical abilities: their song can compel other
creatures to sleep, an effect that becomes stronger the more voices are added to
the choir. Brown harpies live in bands (“choirs”) of 4-6 adults.</p>

<p>Brown harpies fight by using their soporific song and then grappling their
sleeping victims and dropping them from a great height. If they can’t do that
(because the target is too heavy, or resists the song), then they’ll attempt to
rake with their talons. As detailed in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 3</strong>, harpy
flyby attacks receive the -4 for Move and Attack but don’t have their skill
capped at 9, and they may retreat <em>up</em> while dodging to receive a +4 bonus.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 15; <strong>DX</strong> 13; <strong>IQ</strong> 6; <strong>HT</strong> 13</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>DR</strong> 2;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 15; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 13</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6.50; <strong>Move</strong> 3 (Ground)/13 (Air)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Soporific Song (15 vs Will)</strong>: Resisted by Will, at -1 per singing harpy
beyond the first. Affects non-harpies within 10m who hear the song. First
failure causes sluggishness (1/2 Move and Dodge) while the song lasts. Second
failure causes the target to fall asleep for 1 hour or until awoken, possibly
by being dropped from a great height by the harpy.</li>
  <li><strong>Talons (16)</strong>: 1d+3 cut. Reach C. May also <em>grapple</em> at skill 14.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (16)</strong>: 1d+2 cut.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 2; Claws (Talons); DR 3 (Tough Skin); Flight (Winged);
Peripheral Vision; Striking ST 4; Teeth (Sharp); Bestial; Fragile; Social Stigma
(Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Aerobatics-14; Brawling-16; Wrestling-14</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Faerie.</p>

<h2 id="snow-harpies">Snow Harpies</h2>

<p>These inhabit the northern highlands of Gransys, particularly the area known as
Souflayer Canyon. Their skin is black, and their feathers are snow-white with
black spots. Snow harpies possess the same soporific song as their southern
cousins, and are also endowed with a deadly frost breath attack. Use the same
stats for a brown harpy, but add Temperature Tolerance 2 for cold and the
following attack:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frost Breath (14)</strong>: Jet (range 5/10). 1d cr damage with no knockback and no
blunt trauma. Targets hit by this must roll HT with a penalty of -1 per 2
points of damage suffered or be frozen (paralyzed) for 1 minute per margin of
failure. Each snow harpy can use this only once per fight.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="succubi">Succubi</h2>

<p>While they share some similarities with harpies, succubi are demons rather than
mere magical creatures. Immortal spirits given physical form, they linger in
sites of ancient draconic invasions, or close to the Dragon itself during
them. Visually, the main difference between an harpy and a succubus is that a
succubus’ lower body and wings are those of a bat, not a bird. Their fur and
wing membranes are dark brown in color.</p>

<p>They have all the same abilities as common harpies, but their bite also carries
a deadly venom, and their touch carries a curse. Take the stats for a brown
harpy and add Immunity to Metabolic Hazards as well as an 1d toxic follow-up to
their bite. Add the following attack:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Demonic Curse (15 vs. Will)</strong>: Targets an enemy the succubus can see,
suffers from range penalties. Targets who lose the contest suffer from a
1-point Curse as per the spell on <strong>GURPS Magic</strong>, p. 129. Doesn’t work on an
already cursed target.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="silver-sirens">Silver Sirens</h2>

<p>These creatures resemble silver-colored succubi, and are actually guardian
spirits summoned by forgotten sorcery. Therefore, they can usually be found in
dungeons protecting something important. Unlike all other monsters presented in
this article, they are not only sapient but also know magic! While Silver Sirens
can fight in much the same way as harpies, they prefer to cooperate with
stronger guardian beasts, which they target with healing and support spells
while staying out of melee reach.</p>

<p>To make a Silver Siren, take the stats for a Brown Harpy and add Immunity to
Metabolic Hazards. Remove Bestial, change IQ to 12+, and add Magery 2+ along
with Healing and Body Control spells meant to buff allies. This magic requires
song, in the same manner as that of a bard.</p>
