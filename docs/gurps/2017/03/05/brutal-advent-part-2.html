<p>Welcome to another installment on
my <a href="/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">GURPS X-COM: Noises in the Dark campaign report</a>! Today I’ll continue to
tell you about Operation BRUTAL ADVENT, our group’s inaugural mission. The
following PCs participated in it:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kendall Fairbarn</strong>: A paranoid hacker from the UK. Was completely convinced
human society had been heavily infiltrated by shape-changing aliens… and it
turned out he wasn’t entirely wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Minette Duvall</strong>: A bomb-disposal expert from Southern France, Minette is
also quite handy with a rifle. She’s devoutly Catholic and swears a lot when
faced with danger, which is all the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Niu Yulan (AKA Julia Yulan)</strong>: A former hostage negotiatior from China.
Julia is pretty handy with a rifle but her medical training and innate
kindness are equally important parts of her arsenal.</li>
  <li><strong>Jack Choi</strong>: A former police detective from Hong Kong, and a staunch
adherent of the “kick down the door” school of policing despite his light
frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following NPCs also had important roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Valenkov</strong> and <strong>Gutierrez</strong>: A pair of shooters from Russia and Argentina,
respectively, both members of the squad who lost their players just before the
start of the mission.</li>
  <li><strong>Yevgeny Korsakov</strong>: The pilot of the squad’s Skyranger transport.</li>
  <li><strong>Jan Wiest</strong>: A cop stuck in the anomaly zone. Together with his unit, he’s
been fighting the aliens for months.</li>
  <li><strong>Gisela Vahlen and company</strong>: Seven civilians inhabiting a building inside
the anomaly zone. Three of them are relatives of Dr. Vahlen, one of X-COM’s
top scientists.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="evacuation">Evacuation</h2>

<p>After arriving on the scene and <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/02/25/brutal-advent-part-1.html">investigating the anomaly’s effects</a> the
squad managed to pinpoint its source in the St. Marien Hospital. They decided
they will eventually have to get in there to stop all of this, but rescuing the
civilians should come first. Choi is a little disappointed that they can’t just
call in an airstrike and level the place.</p>

<p>Kendall manages to reach Korsakov, who tells them the Skyranger will be fully
refueled in an hour, but that he can leave ealier if they don’t need to fly a
long distance. Getting them heavier weapons would require flying all the way to
HQ and back, though, which would take a whole day. The local military doesn’t
want to share. The squad asks him to fly in ASAP in order to get the civilians
out.</p>

<p>Korsakov says he’ll be there in 30 minutes, and calls again after that exact
amount of time to request specific landing coordinates. He suggests the roof of
a building just behind the one everyone is in, in the middle of the block. It’s
lower than the surrounding structures, which should provide cover from snipers.</p>

<p>The PCs accept his suggestion, and having prepared to move out with the
civilians in the last half-hour, begin to do so immediately. Just before they
leave the apartment building, however, they get a worrying radio message from
the pilot: “I see a weird light nearby. I will investigate.”</p>

<h2 id="ambush">Ambush!</h2>

<p>This is worrying because Korsakov is never supposed to leave the cockpit during
an extraction, and he knows it. Before the party and the civilians have crossed
half the courtyard, they see him exit through the ground floor door of the
center building and head east at a brisk pace, flight helmet still on. In the
direction he’s walking there’s an eerie blue light shining through an open
second-floor window.</p>

<p>Choi and Kendall rush to the pilot’s side, and notice he’s obviously out of it,
as if hypnotized. He doesn’t stop to talk to them, but doesn’t resist when
physically stopped from walking. The others remain with the refugees, herding
them towards the Skyranger, but Vasily shouts out a warning when he notices that
the blue light is rapidly intensifying. In a second, a ball of fire shoots
towards Choi! He dodges it, and it leaves a small frost-rimmed crater in the
ground.</p>

<p>Minette pours suppressing fire into the window the shot came from, as Choi and
Kendall drop smoke grenades for cover. Julia and the NPCs stay by the civilians
as they run into the building. As the smoke grenades go off, a huge alien
<em>thing</em> jumps out from the window to the left of the one Minette was shooting
at, and disappears into the cloud. They only catch a brief glimpse, but it looks
like a giant seven-fingered hand.</p>

<p>Kendall takes Korsakov’s hand and books it back to the Skyranger. The pilot, now
recovered, is only too happy to run the rest of the way towards the safety of
his cockpit as Julia and the NPC soldiers finish loading the civilians into the
craft. Minette stands ready to shoot the alien if it gets close, but it’s hard
to see into the smoke from this distance.</p>

<p>Choi stays near the smoke, intent on fighting the alien. He fires blindly into
the cloud and hits it, but then the creature charges at him and pokes him in the
chest hard enough to break some ribs despite his body armor. He won’t survive
another hit like that!</p>

<p>Kendall runs back to the fray, followed by Valenkov and Gutierrez. The NPCs fire
burst at it and score a few hits, which do a lot less damage than
expected. The creature swipes at them with its fingers, but thankfully
misses. It hits Kendall with another energy blast, but the hacker’s ridiculous
armor loadout pays off, and he gets away with only a slight frost burn.</p>

<p>Valenkov manages to attract the alien’s attention for long enough to
allow Kendall to stick a greande wrapped in duct-tape on its skin. They get
clear, and the grenade finishes it off. This was their first official close
encounter, and it was only one alien. How many more are there?</p>

<p>They would soon find out. With the civilians clear of the danger zone, it was
time to plan the attack on the alien position at the hospital.</p>

<p>With the campaign already over, it’s safe to spoil you on the alien’s true
nature. It was a Bakegumo (“goblin-spider”), a creature that’s an integral part
of the ecosystem of the Dreams. They do indeed look like giant hands, though the
seven-fingered part was a personal addition: it both made them weirder and
referenced the “mystical” number seven, which I decided would be a recurring
motif in the alien forces. After this encounter, the PCs named it “Rosie” - I
never revealed any of the creature names in the Dreams of Ruin book, an
encouraged players to come up with their own.</p>

<p>The original stats for Bakegumo gave then five hit dice, so my version of them
is large and has exceptional ST and HP. It’s also Unliving, which explains why
bullets didn’t do much against it. It retains <em>all</em> of the original’s
supernatural abilities, so it’s a good thing no one was grappled by it. This one
was a scout, and approached the building in the half-hour between the call going
out and Korsakov arriving.</p>

<p>The party did an excellent job coming up with a plan to quickly evacuate the
civilians: the longer they waited, the more aliens would converge on their
position. Waiting the whole day for more ordinance would bring an overwhelming
attack force a few hours in. Using the grenade at the end was also inspired, and
worth the two uses of Gizmo it cost Kendall. Without that the fight would have
been a lot longer and more costly for the PCs.</p>

<p>They made some mistakes as well: smoke grenades were a total newbie trap in this
game, as the creatures of the Dreams see through a special psychic sense that
completely ignores things that impair normal sight. There was no way to know
this in the first mission, of course, but they would learn the aliens don’t rely
on normal sight if they had autopsied any of them in the strategic
interludes. Alas, this ended up not happening before the game ended.</p>
