<p>Looks like my <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017-03-28-psi-wars-golko.md">nascent Psi Wars campaign</a> has gathered attention from the
highest of circles, by which I
mean <a href="https://mailanka.blogspot.com.br/2017/03/a-psi-wars-round-up.html">Mailanka himself is following the game</a>. So hey, no pressure.</p>

<p>I only noticed the above post today, since I was a bit behind on my RSS
reading. It contains a very detailed summary of my recruitment/character
creation thread, with links to relevant posts and an analysis of some of my
campaign decisions. That’s a better summary than I could have written myself, so
go read it! I’ll use this post to provide some additional context on my
decisions.</p>

<p>First of all, a small nitpick: It’s “Bira’s Octopus Carnival” :). Bliss
Authority was indeed the one who had the idea for a Psi Wars game on the RPG.net
forums, but the blog is mine. It’s all good, though! Let’s move on to the good
stuff:</p>

<h2 id="on-communion">On Communion</h2>

<p>Mailanka comments about my stated view that True Communion is good, and Broken
and Dark Communion are bad. Indeed, I know that things were meant to be more
ambiguous than that in the Psi Wars text, but this is my first time actually
<em>using</em> the material! I wanted to keep things simple both for myself and for any
players who weren’t familiar with Psi Wars as its own thing.</p>

<p>So, for this specific campaign, I adopted a stance more closely aligned with
that of Star Wars itself. A game more focused on exploring Communion would
certainly benefit from the more neutral view.</p>

<p>There was also the more practical reason that it looked like we were headed
towards a party which included followers of conflicting Paths, and I wanted to
avoid that in the first game. This ended up not happening, as no one spent
points in Communion to start. Jatuu the former gladiator might still end up
going either True or Dark in the future, if the game lasts long enough.</p>

<h2 id="robots-and-cyborgs">Robots and Cyborgs</h2>

<p>I denied lordmcdeath’s wish to play “a robot who pretends he’s a cyborg” for a
couple of reasons, the main one being that I wanted to limit the amount of
template surgery in this particular game. There are no ready-made racial
templates for PC-level robots, and while something could be arranged by taking
the base Android template and tweaking it into a usable racial template, the
ensuing discussion would have added more time to the already lengthy
play-by-forum character creation process. Reality Glitch’s character had already
gone through an extensive round of such discussion, and they ended up leaving
the game.</p>

<p>Mailanka’s discussion on whether it’s thematically appropriate to have robots
pass themselves off as organic is another reason why I disallowed it for this
game - it’s not a theme I wanted to focus on.</p>

<p>That said, I might end up working on a “playable robot” racial template to post
here in Octopus Carnival, possibly even with an “organic disguise” lens. Just
because I’m not focusing on that in my current campaign doesn’t mean I don’t
like the concept!</p>

<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing…</h2>

<p>I’m very happy to see this game has been noticed by the setting’s author and I
hope I don’t disappoint in my execution :). If you’re interested in following
the game as it happens, the out-of-character thread is <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?800200-GURPS-Psi-Wars-Golko-Wants-You-Dead!">here</a> and the
in-character thread is <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?800803-Psi-Wars-Golko-Wants-You-Dead!">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next up: Golko himself!</p>
