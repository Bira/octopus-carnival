<p>At this point in the campaign our PCs had <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/03/22/brutal-advent-part-3.html">completed their first assignment</a>
and brought home <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/03/30/x-com-arsenal-of-ruin.html">a ton of alien doodads</a>, though they didn’t know much about
them yet. It was time to do something about that last part, and this post will
both tell you how they did it and give you a peek behind the curtain of my
research system.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-science">The Power of Science!</h2>

<p>Research was always one of my favorite parts of any X-COM game, especially in
that first playthrough where the tech tree is still a mistery. I wanted to bring
the same sense of mistery and discovery to this campaign, while keeping
bookkeeping to a minimum. This meant I needed an intriguing tech tree, and a
simple way to walk it.</p>

<p>The composition of the tech tree was the easiest part: as it turns out,
the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/152691/The-Dreams-of-Ruin">Dreams of Ruin</a> book already has a perfectly usable and quite
comprehensive tree! I would need some conversion work before I could use it, but
the general shape of the thing was already good.</p>

<p>The main conversion work lay in deciding how my version of X-COM could perform
this research. The detailed descriptions in the original material are geared
towards a D&amp;D fantasy setting: a place with medieval technology but rich in
magic where the greatest challenge lies in building scientific instruments
precise enough to study the Dreams, each of which is a unique major artifact in
its own right.</p>

<p>The research challenges faced by X-COM were the exact opposite of the scenario
above: its scientists have an abundance of mass-produced high-precision
instruments, but must discover magic from first principles over the course of
the campaign in order to truly understand the threat they face. This means I
would need to insert a few extra items on the research tree related to
that. As pretty much all the alien technology involves some form of magic,
discovering its principles is a very high priority strategic goal - the rest of
the research will be severely limited until that happens.</p>

<p>Another important consideration was to figure out the pace of research. This is
determined by your basic infrastructure, which in the original material is
expressed in fantasy terms (“a single wealthy kingdom”, “all the world’s
kingdoms”, “the combined might of the Nine Hells”). Each level gives you a
shorter interval between possible breakthroughs, which is important because the
spread of the Dreams becomes irreversible 13 years after the first trees
appear. I had to decide how the X-COM project measured up in that scale.</p>

<h2 id="the-noises-in-the-dark-research-system">The Noises in the Dark Research System</h2>

<p>At the end of each field op, I would present the <em>players</em> with a
list of research topics, drawn from the loot their PCs brought from this and
previous missions, and from previous research or other story developments. Each
topic would have a cost in <em>Research Points</em>, of which they would have an amount
corresponding to X-COM’s research budget. This budget, in turn, would depend on
how happy with the organization the Council nations were, just like in the
computer games.</p>

<p>Paying for a technology in full meant it gets researched and yields it fruits
before the next mission comes up. If they could only pay part of a topic’s cost,
those points would remain “banked” until after the next mission.</p>

<p>Each of these “research phases” should represent the effort spent in one
research interval, though this part didn’t end up mattering a lot in play as I
never really tracked how much time passed between missions. I believe I settled
internally on 1-month intervals in my head, though if we were doing this
according to the <strong>Dreams of Ruin</strong> rules it should be three months for a
starting X-COM (“intermediary” infrastructure).</p>

<p>The list after their first operation consisted of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advanced Medkits</li>
  <li>Personal-Scale Combat Drones</li>
  <li>Bakegumo Corpse</li>
  <li>Puppet Corpse</li>
  <li>Alien Guns</li>
  <li>Alien Swords</li>
  <li>Alien Explosives (from mines and such)</li>
  <li>Black Tree Fragments</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two items were the technologies they would have started with had they
picked Vahlen or Shen as leads, respectively. The rest was from alien loot.</p>

<p>All of the items cost a single point, but they also had a single point to spend
at the start. After some discussion, the players ended up voting for the Black
Tree Fragments: the trees had <em>really</em> impressed them!</p>

<p>Strategically speaking, this was a good decision, since the Trees of Woe are one
of the fundamental research topics in the original material. However, the fact
that their destroyed the trees in the first mission using extreme amounts of
explosive meant R&amp;D only had a limited amount of material to work with, so I
decided this topic alone wouldn’t give them the full information on the
trees. It did give them a bit of data in their structure (“more like a fungus
than a plant, traces of metal mixed in”), as well as giving them the goal of
bringing in a proper tree sample. It also led to the researchers noticing the
fragments and most alien artifacts had this weird red dust in all of their nooks
and crannies, so the dust became a topic available for the next phase of
research.</p>

<p>Soklov’s game benefit also came in handy here, as he also gave the group a more
complete picture of what he termed the “Hostage Effect”, which is what the
original material calls <em>psychic numbness</em>. No means to counter it yet, but now
they know it exists and what it does.</p>

<p>This sort of decision is still something that causes me some worry, to be
honest. Was I giving my players a good enough benefit for their choice? This was
a PbP game, remember, so each mission took literally months to resolve. Research
phases would be few and far between, and I didn’t want to give the group the
impression they weren’t making progress. Here, opening up a new goal seems to
have satisfied them, but in retrospect I should probably have given them the Red
Dust information for free in addition to the other things. Knowing about the
spores early on would likely have changed their perception of things quite
significantly, and it’s something they never ended up voting for on their
own.</p>
