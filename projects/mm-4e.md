title: "Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual/Vault"
permalink: /projects/mm-4e/
---

This project was started in early January 2019. Right around this time several
"Let's Read" threads for D&D books were flourishing on the RPG.net forums and I
was sorta binging on them. There were threads for the 3.5 Monster Manual, the
3.0 Monster Manual II, the BECMI Creature Catalog, the 3.0 Epic Level Handbook,
and even the Book of Erotic Fantasy!

I decided to get in on the action, and to focus on my favorite D&D edition which
I saw wasn't getting much love. Since the threads about monster books were my
favorite, I thought I'd start with the first Monster Manual for Fourth
Edition. Early Fourth Edition monsters have a well-documented "bug" in their
damage calculations, and a lot of the MM monsters were later updated in the
Monster Vault supplement, so I figured I couldn't really read one book without
also reading the other. And so here we are!

In an uncommon move for this blog, I'm posting my comments first on an RPG.net
thread, and here with some delay (plus text corrections and illustrations). This
is what we have so far on the blog:

- [Introduction][1]: Introduces the project and discusses the damage bug I
mentioned above, as well as how to fix it for older monsters.

After this, we get right on the monsters:


- A
  - [Aboleth][2]: Fishy masterminds!
  - [More aboleths][3]: Someone on RPG.net asked me to review the aboleths from
    an issue of Dungeon, and I obliged.
  - [Abomination][4]: A grab-bag of epic horrors from the edge of time.
  - [Angel][5]: Messengers of the gods (be they good or evil).
  - [Archons][6]: Soldiers of the primordials.
  - [Azer][7]: Dwarves on fire.

- B

  - [Balhannoth][8]: Ninja slugs of the Underdark.
  - [Banshrae][9]: Kung-fu mantid fey.
  - [Basilisk][10]: Lizards with a stony gaze.
  - [Bat][11]: What you find when you go into bat country.
  - [Battlebriar][12]: Weaponized biotech siege engines.
  - [Bear][13]: For all the bear necessities of life.
  - [Beetle][14]: Big bugs.
  - [Behemoths][15]: Dinosaurs!
  - [Berbalang][16]: Memory-eaters loosely based on Filipino myth.
