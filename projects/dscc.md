RPG.net forum user zedturtle decided to do a reading of the Dark Sun Campaign
Setting book, and I decided to do a parallel one of the Dark Sun Creature
Catalog. There were the only two books published for Dark Sun during D&D Fourth
Edition: the Campaign Setting book also included player-facing material.

This page collects all posts related to that project.

- [Introduction][1]: Where I talk a bit about the history of the book and
  include our customary refresher on 4e monste rules.


This is the list of monsters from A to Z, which will grow as the book is read:

- A
  - [Aarakocra][2]
  - [Anakore][3]

- B
  - [Baazrag][4]
  - [Belgoi][5]
  - [Braxat][6]
