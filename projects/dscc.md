RPG.net forum user zedturtle decided to do a reading of the Dark Sun Campaign
Setting book, and I decided to do a parallel one of the Dark Sun Creature
Catalog. There were the only two books published for Dark Sun during D&D Fourth
Edition: the Campaign Setting book also included player-facing material.

This page collects all posts related to that project.

- [Introduction][1]: Where I talk a bit about the history of the book and
  include our customary refresher on 4e monste rules.


This is the list of monsters from A to Z, which will grow as the book is read:

- A
  - [Aarakocra][2]
  - [Anakore][3]

- B
  - [Baazrag][4]
  - [Belgoi][5]
  - [Braxat][6]
  - [Brohg][7]

- C
  - [Cactus][8]
  - [Chathrang][9]
  - [Cilops][10]
  - [Cloud Ray][11]
  - [Crodlu][12]

- D
  - [Dagorran][13]
  - [Dragonborn][14]
  - [Drake][15]
  - [Dune Reaper][17]
  - [Dwarf][16]

- E
  - [Eladrin][18]
