As the title implies, this is an adaptation of the Dragon's Dogma videogame to
GURPS. It tries to follow the structure laid out in [GURPS Adaptations][0],
dealing with places, characters and items in that order, followed by a
bestiary. As of this writing, it's _almost_ complete, and consists of the
following posts:

## Introduction and High Concept

These articles talk about the Dragon's Dogma videogame, my approach to adapting
it, and what a tabletop campaign in this setting could look like.

- [Adapting Videogames][1]
- [High Concept][2]
- [Adventuring in Gransys][3]

## Places

These talk about the setting of Dragon's Dogma, and focus on expanding the
in-game map into something that resembles a medieval setting, expanding details
hinted at in the game's plot into an interesting political situation for it.

- [How big is this place anyway?][4]
- [The Sovereign Duchy of Gransys][5]
- [Villages and Baronies][6]
- [Towns][7]
- [Castles][8]
- [The City of Gran Soren][9]

## Characters

Here I discuss the differences between magic in Gransys and in generic Dungeon
Fantasy and the role of the existing DF archetypes in the setting. I also
introduce two new archetypes inspired by some of the most distinctive vocations
of the original game. There are also stats for Pawn and Arisen characters.

- [Characters, Part 1][10]
- [Characters, Part 2][11]
- [Characters, Part 3][12]
- [The Magic Archer][13]
- [The Mystic Knight][14]
- [Character Races][15]

## Things

Here I discuss what equipment should be avaible where in the setting, and
introduce a relatively rules-light system for upgrading equipment with mundane
and magical enhancements that complements the default enchantment rules in
GURPS.

- [Items and Equipment][16]
- [Dragon's Dogma Equipment Upgrades in Dungeon Fantasy][17]
- [Artifacts of Gransys][18]

## Bestiary

And finally, here is a big ol' list of monsters inspired by Dragon's Dogma. The
posts here take a mixed approach between pointing out which published monsters
fit into Gransys and providing entirely new stat blocks.

- [Enemies Overview][19]
- [Human Enemies][20]
- [Goblins][21]
- [Wolves][22]
- [Saurians][23]
- [Harpies][24]
- [The Undead][25]
