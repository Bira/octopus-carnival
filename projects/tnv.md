Unlike the previous Let's Reads, I'm planning to keep this one in sync with the
RPG.net forum version. It covers a book named **Monster Vault: Threats to the
Nentir Vale**, the last "proper" monster book for Dungeons & Dragons 4th
Edition.

This page collects all posts related to that project.

- [Introduction][1]: Talks a bit about the history of the book and the setting
  it describes.

As more monsters are added, they will be linked below.

- A
  - [Abyssal Plague Demon][2]

- B
  - [Barrowhaunts][3]
  - [Bitterstrike][4]
  - [Blackfang Gnolls][5]
  - [Bloodfire Ooze][6]
