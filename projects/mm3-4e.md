Like the previous Let's Reads, this one was started off-site a while ago: July
30th 2021, in this case. We now move to the Monster Manual 3. Chronologically,
this is the first D&D 4e monster book to include the celebrated "new math",
though we already had a taste of it back when we read the Monster Vault.

This page collects all the posts related to that project.

- [Introduction][1]: Talks a bit about the new math and the history of the book.

And here are the monsters, in alphabetic order by the title of their
entries.

- A
  - [Ape][2]
  - [Apocalypse Spell][3]
  - [Arcanian][4]

- B
  - [Banderhobb][5]
