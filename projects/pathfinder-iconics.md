title: "Pathfinder Iconics in Dungeon Fantasy"
permalink: /projects/pathfinder-iconics/
---

This project began shortly after
the [Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game Kickstarter][0] was sucessfully funded. I
thought it would be good to have a large pool of ready-to-play characters to
help those who wanted to get into DF before the full boxed set was out, and when
it finally did to provide alternatives to the set of finished characters that
will be contained there. I know that many others have done a marvelous job
adapting Pathfinder monsters to DF, so I thought I would do the same with its
large stable of iconic characters.

The goal of this project, then, is to end up with a set of adapted Pathfinder
Iconics covering all of the templates from **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 1:
Adventurers**. I use material from **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level**
and **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 11: Power-Ups** when necessary, and I use metric
units because I like them, but otherwise I stay as close to vanilla DF as
possible. This does mean I'm not using **Low-Tech's** improved armor rules, for
example. I also refrain from using rules not present in the main "numbered" set
of DF books.

This goal was achieved in January of 2017! Below are links to the eleven
resulting iconics. If I ever adapt any others, they will also be mentioned in
this page.
