This project began shortly after
the [Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game Kickstarter][0] was sucessfully funded. I
thought it would be good to have a large pool of ready-to-play characters to
help those who wanted to get into DF before the full boxed set was out, and when
it finally did to provide alternatives to the set of finished characters that
will be contained there. I know that many others have done a marvelous job
adapting Pathfinder monsters to DF, so I thought I would do the same with its
large stable of iconic characters.

This goal was achieved in January of 2017! However, when the **Dungeon Fantasy
RPG** actually went out to backers in August of that same year, I noticed it was
different enough from the **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy** line that preceded it that
the iconics I made wouldn't quite work in a campaign that used only the boxed
set. Therefore, I set out to make a _second_ set of iconics using only the rules
from the boxed set, as explained [here][13].

Below are links to the eleven resulting iconics. Each one has a link to both its
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy** version and its **DFRPG** version. If a given
character is missing a link, it's because the corresponding sheet isn't done
yet. Keep an eye on the site to see then it's published!

The GURPS DF versions use material from DF 1: Adventurers, DF 3: The Next Level,
and DF 11: Power-ups. The DFRPG versions use material from the boxed set. In
both versions I add a little extra original material where it's needed, and use
metric units because I like metric (just multiply weights by 2 if you _must_
have Imperial pounds).

- **Amiri the Barbarian**: [GURPS DF][1], [DFRPG][14]
- **Lem the Bard**: [GURPS DF][2], [DFRPG][15]
- **Kyra the Cleric**: [GURPS DF][3], [DFRPG][16]
- **Lini the Druid**: [GURPS DF][4], [DFRPG][17]
- **Seelah the Paladin**: [GURPS DF][5], [DFRPG][18]
- **Valeros the Fighter**: [GURPS DF][6], [DFRPG][19]
- **Harsk the Ranger**: [GURPS DF][7]
- **Sajan the Monk**: [GURPS DF][8]
- **Jirelle the Swashbuckler**: [GURPS DF][9]
- **Merisiel the Rogue**: [GURPS DF][10]
- **Ezren the Wizard**: [GURPS DF][11]

I didn't stop making characters after I was done with the Main Eleven, though!
With the initial goal complete, I could relax my restrictions a bit. The
character below uses a broader set of sources, and thus is a little more
"exotic" than the Main Eleven, with rules not covered by the boxed set. The same
will be true of any further characters I add here.
