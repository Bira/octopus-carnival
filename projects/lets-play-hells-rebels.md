This is a series of posts wherein I do a solo playthrough of Hell's Rebels,
using DFRPG as the rule system with stuff mixed in from vanilla GURPS where
appropriate. This page is being written in 2026, but the actual project has been
going on since 2023.

Some of the posts related to this project are already published as of this
writing, and the page will be updated with the rest as they become
available. There's plenty of material in the queue, as I've been playing since I
first announced I'd do it.

## Posts About The Project Itself

- [Let's Play Hell's Rebels!][1] : Where I announce the project and explain the
  reasoning behind it.

- [LPHR: Devils and Other Fiends][3]: Where I decide what I will do about devil
  stats for the game.

- [LPHR: Adjusting Setting Assumptions][9]: Where I talk about the overal
  setting adjustments I'm going to make to fit this campaign to Dungeon Fantasy,
  and link to several other rules posts which you can also find in the next
  session.

- [Player Character Origins][5]: A list of possible player character origins for
  the game. It's somewhat depeer than the cursory treatment given to it in the
  Hell's Rebels Player's Guide, and inspired by the excellent character themes
  in the Neverwinter Campaign Setting.

- [Origin Corrections][6]: In which I fix one of the origins to better mesh with
  the adventure background. This fix was already applied to the post in the
  previous link, so this one is only here for historical interest.

- [A Decision][7]: Explains why I've never posted any PCs or play scenes here
  even though I had been doing them in the background, and why I decided to
  start.

## Supplementary Rules Material

These are posts that might not have been tagged as part of the project to start
with, but were motivated by stuff I wanted to add to the game. Listed in
chronological order.


- [Underwater Dungeon Fantasy][2]: Adventure 02 and 03 feature significant
  underwater bits.

- [Wealth in D&D and Dungeon Fantasy][10]: In which I figure out a nice and easy
  conversion rate between Pathfinder 1e/D&D 3.5 coinage and Dungeon Fantasy
  money.

- [Underwater Dungeon Fantasy 2: Items and Artifacts][8]: Contains items useful
  for underwater adventuring.

- [Denizens of the Sea][4]: Contains some aquatic species that can be used in
  the game. Not explicitly connected to the game, as the setting information is
  generic, but one of the PCs is an Atlantean.

## Player Characters

Our heroes! I like making parties of five ever since I started GMing D&D 4th
Edition.

The character sheets here depict how the characters are at the start of the
campaign. I might add updated versions as the opportunity presents itself.

- [Jade Irinka][11]: The Sixth Raven.
