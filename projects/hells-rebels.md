This is a series of posts wherein I read and comment on Paizo's Hell's Rebels
Adventure Path for the Pathfinder system. I like the Pathfinder setting, but its
rules aren't exactly my favorite, which means I'll provide GURPS conversion
notes along with the comments. As I read, I'll try to imagine how a hypotetical
party of Dungeon Fantasy delvers would fare on each scene.

This is an ongoing project. These are the posts that comprise it:

- [Let's Read Hell's Rebels][1]: An introduction that goes into a little more
  detail about my motivation and methods.

- [The Player's Guide][2]: Where I go through all of the free Player's Guide for
  this adventure path and pick a party of delvers.

- **In Hell's Bright Shadow**: The absurdly named first adventure, covered in
  several posts.

  - [Part 1][3]: Fledglings of Silver.
  - [Meet the NPCs, Part 1][4]: Descriptions and conversion notes for the NPCs
    met so far.
