This is a series of posts wherein I read and comment on Paizo's Hell's Rebels
Adventure Path for the Pathfinder system. I like the Pathfinder setting, but its
rules aren't exactly my favorite, which means I'll provide GURPS conversion
notes along with the comments. As I read, I'll try to imagine how a hypotetical
party of Dungeon Fantasy delvers would fare on each scene.

This is an ongoing project. These are the posts that comprise it:

- [Let's Read Hell's Rebels][1]: An introduction that goes into a little more
  detail about my motivation and methods.

- [The Player's Guide][2]: Where I go through all of the free Player's Guide for
  this adventure path and pick a party of delvers.

- **In Hell's Bright Shadow**: The absurdly named first adventure, covered in
  several posts.

  - [Part 1: Fledglings of Silver][3]: In which the PCs are drawn to form the
    core of a new resistance movement.
  - [Meet the NPCs, Part 1][4]: Descriptions and conversion notes for the NPCs
    met so far.
  - [Part 2: Rebuilding the Ravens][5]: In which the PCs do what it says on the
    title.
  - [Part 3: Redactions and Revelations][6]: In which the PCs discover the fate
    of the Sacred Order of Archivists.

- **Turn of the Torrent**: The second adventure.

    - [Part 1: A Cousin's Plea][7]: In which the PCs set out to find a
      potentially useful ally. Not much meat here, but you have to start
      somewhere.
    - [Part 2: Trouble in Old Kintargo][8] has some layout issues, but presents
      three interesting missions that further the cause of the Silver Ravens.

    - **Part 3: The Lucky Bones** is about this huge dungeon, and I had to
      resort to multiple posts to cover it.
      - [Part 3-1: The Lucky Bones][10] covers the first half of the first
        level of the dungeon.
      - [Part 3-2: Haunted Opium Den][9] covers the second half of the
        first level of the dungeon.
      - [Part 3-3: Flooded Hideout][11] covers the second level of the dungeon.

    - [Part 4: Conclusion][12] covers the final "cutscene" and the main ways in
      which it can go off the rails due to unforeseen PC badassitude.

- **Dance of the Damned**: The third adventure.

    - [Part 1][13]: A council and a fish.
    - [Part 2][14]: A feast and a fort.
    - [Part 3][15]: A party for partisans

- **A Song of Silver**: The fourth adventure, in which the final battle for the
  city takes place.

  - [Part 1][16]: Taking the city a district at a time, Assassin's Creed style.
