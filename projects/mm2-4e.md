This project was actually started in May 13th 2020, but since I wanted to wait
until all the [Monster Manual/Monster Vault][1] posts had made it into the blog,
I'm only beginning to post it now. This is a continuation of the first Monster
Manual Let's Read linked in this paragraph, where we move on to the Monster
Manual 2.

Below, you can see links for all the related posts:

- [Introduction][2]: Introduces the project, gives a primer on how 4e monsters
  work, and discusses the fixes applied since the first Monster Manual as well
  as the math bugs still present in the book.

who already appeared in the previous Monster Manual and who are getting more
variants here. Here they are, from A to Z:
