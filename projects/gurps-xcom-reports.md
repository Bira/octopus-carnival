These are the notes and play reports for a GURPS campaign I GMed over the
RPG.net forum from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016. I consider it to be a
success, as far as forum games go: tough it wasn't finished for reasons
explained below, the players had plenty of fun and I so did I. It consists of
the following posts:

## General Posts

- [GURPS X-COM: Noises in the Dark (a campaign post-mortem)][1]: A high level
  description of the campaign, what worked, what didn't and why it ended.

- [GURPS X-COM: Campaign Setup][2]: A more detailed description of the campaign
  setup, the choices given to the players there, and what the consequences of
  each were.

## Play Reports

- **Operation BRUTAL ADVENT**: Strike One's inaugural operation, which took
  place in Germany.

  - [Part 1][3]
  - [Part 2][4]
  - [Part 3][5]

- [First Research Phase][7]: This both details the research system I used in the
  campaign and tells you how the first research phase went.

- **Operation DARK JUDAS**: Strike One's second operation, which took
  place in Brazil.
