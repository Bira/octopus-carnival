These are the notes and play reports for a GURPS campaign I GMed over the
RPG.net forum from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016. I consider it to be a
success, as far as forum games go: tough it wasn't finished for reasons
explained below, the players had plenty of fun and I so did I. It consists of
the following posts:

- [GURPS X-COM: Noises in the Dark (a campaign post-mortem)][1]: A high level
  description of the campaign, what worked, what didn't and why it ended.

- [GURPS X-COM: Campaign Setup][2]: A more detailed description of the campaign
  setup, the choices given to the players there, and what the consequences of
  each were.

- [Operation BRUTAL ADVENT, Part 1][3]: The first half of Strike One's inaugural
  operation.
