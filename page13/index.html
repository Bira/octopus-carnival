        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The encounter table includes a <em>lot</em> of undead, and some spellcasters like the
Human Transmuter from the MV to act as living Red Wizards. Valindra’s special
projects also get some consideration here, and then we move on to the lich
herself.</p>

<h2 id="the-neverwinter-nine">The Neverwinter Nine</h2>

<p>These were the renowned bodyguards of Lord Nasher Alagondar a century ago. After
their deaths, they were buried in the castle crypts in honor of their exemplary
service. Should Valindra manage to animate them as undead, they’d have the stats
of a Deathlock Wight from the MV or the stats for a Unhallowed Wight presented
in this book (level 7 soldier, 80 hp, claws that immobilize and drain healing
surges, auto-damage as an opportunity action on enemies who pass a saving
throw). You can also use similar undead monstrosities if you want to.</p>

<p>Members of the Neverwinter Nine get two extra powers in addition to whatever
their base stat block gives them. <strong>One in Nine</strong> is an encounter power that
lets the creature teleport and swap places with another of the Nine that’s
within 20 squares. And <strong>Change Shape</strong> lets them take the form of a Medium
humanoid they killed during the last encounter, lasting until they use the power
again or cancel the transformation.</p>

<p>That last one means the Nine can serve story roles as infiltrators. One might
even manage to replace Lord Neverember or another big shot.</p>

<h2 id="ash-zombie">Ash Zombie</h2>

<p>These are zombies produced by the particular conditions of the eruption disaster
area. They leave a trail of ash in their wake and are drawn to “fresh” life, the
younger the better.</p>

<p>Any corporeal undead can be converted into the “Ash” equivalent with the
addition of the <strong>Puff of Ash</strong> encounter power. When the creature is first
bloodied, this triggers and enemy Fortitude in a Close Burst 2. A hit makes the
target grant combat advantage and prevents them from spending healing surges
(save ends both).</p>

<h2 id="lorragauth">Lorragauth</h2>

<p>Lorragauth was a particularly despicable elder black dragon who died in the
process of destroying his own domain, which he started doing because he realized
he was dying. If he couldn’t have it, then no one else could!</p>

<p>If Valindra succeeds at reanimating him, he’s going to use the stats for a
dracolich from the Monster Vault or the Forgotten Realms Campaign
Setting. Either is going to make him a Level 12 Solo Controller and one the most
powerful monsters in the entire campaign.</p>

<h2 id="valinda-shadowmantle">Valinda Shadowmantle</h2>

<p>Valindra is much like a typical lich in that she’s extremely arrogant,
egotistical and ambitious. She serves Tam because it suits her for now and is a
very competent lieutenant, but her arrogance makes her prone to underestimating
her opposition.</p>

<p>She has complete confidence that her soul vessel is securely hidden and will
never be found by any of her enemies, so she doesn’t fear destruction and fights
with seemingly suicidal zeal to protect her plans.</p>

<p>How right she is depends on how the GM wishes to play her. If they want the PCs
to defeat her after a single climatic battle, the vessel is right there in her
inner sanctum at the Dread Ring. If they want to make her a recurring threat,
it’s hidden in the far away Thayan city of Scorrus (which is covered later in
the book).</p>

<p>Velindra’s stats shows us she was an eladrin in life, probably a sun elf. She’s
a Level 9 Elite Controller with 188 HP. She has a ground speed of 6, a flight
speed of 4, and darkvision.</p>

<p>Her basic melee attack is a <strong>Vampiric Touch</strong> that deals necrotic damage and
heals Valindra for the same amount. This will be quite annoying to PCs and
greatly increase her staying power. Her basic ranged attack is a <strong>Phantom
Claw</strong> that targets one or two creatures, deals necrotic and psychic damage, and
immobilizes (save ends). Each failed saving throw lets her slide the target 2
squares. On a miss, the target is still slowed (save ends).</p>

<p>She has a <strong>Profane Fire</strong> attack that’s pretty much a fireball that does
necrotic and fire damage, and recharges when she’s bloodied. And she retains the
<strong>Fey Step</strong> she had in life.</p>

<p>As minor actions, she can use one of two encounter powers. <strong>Shadow Cloak</strong>
gives her insubstantial and phasing but prevents her from taking standard
actions until she ends the whole effect as a free action. And <strong>Reanimate</strong> lets
her bring a dead non-minion ally back into the fight as an undead creature. The
creature comes back with HP equal half its bloodied value and gains Resist
Necrotic 10 and Vulnerable Radiant 5. The target must have been a living
creature before dying - if it was undead already, this doesn’t work.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Which of these is the Thayan’s most fearsome weapon depends on how you want to
play them. If they’re an insidious and secretive threat in your campaign, then
you’ll get a lot of mileage out of the Neverwinter Nine and their ability to
replace key people in other organizations. If they’re a more direct and forceful
enemy, facing Lorragauth is a distinct possibility in the PCs’ futures.</p>

<p>Either way, Valindra herself is a key player and should likely be there for the
final fight. PCs might end up facing her a few times before then, depending on
how secure you want her soul vessel to be. Finding it could be a neat series of
adventures in itself.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>When Szass Tam the epic lich took over the nation of Thay, he tasked the Red
Wizards with building a series of fortresses over powerful sources of
necromantic magic all through the Realms. These fortresses would siphon and
channel magic energy to him, helping him power a major ritual that would turn
him into a god.</p>

<p>The Dread Ring was the fortress built into the Neverwinter Wood. The Thayans’
plan here was to wake up the slumbering primordial Maegera, which would level
Neverwinter completely and kill every one of its inhabitants. The power derived
from these deaths would then be sent to Tam. The wizards were foiled at the last
minute, yet Maegera still woke up a little and caused the eruption which
<em>almost</em> destroyed Neverwinter.</p>

<p>Now the Thayans are back. There are little more than frightened whispers about
their presence in the region, and no one knows they were responsible for
destroying the city thirty years ago, but if left unchecked there’s a good
chance they’ll finish the job, one way or another.</p>

<h2 id="goals-and-strategies">Goals and Strategies</h2>

<p>The Thayan presence in the region is focused on the ruins of the Dread Ring,
where living wizards and undead laborers work tirelessly to rebuild the walls of
the fortress and fix its damaged magic circuits. They’re led by a lich named
Valindra Shadowmantle, one of Tam’s lieutenants.</p>

<p>Her mission is to either restore the Ring to its old purpose, or to find a new
one for it. The first goal is likely impossible - the godhood ritual does not
allow for second chances and all of the other fortresses have proved
unusable. Valindra has a pretty good idea of how she will reach the second goal,
though.</p>

<p>She has discovered why this site was a suitable location for the fortress in the
first place! Deep beneath its location is the incredibly ancient tomb of a great
black dragon named Lorragauth. Inside rests the beast’s intact skeleton, which
emits a great deal of necrotic energy. Valindra thinks it’s possible to animate
the skeleton as a dracolich under her control, and she’s “conquered” a local
cell of the Cult of the Dragon to aid her in this endeavor.</p>

<p>The Cult of the Dragon are an old Forgotten Realms standby: yet another bunch of
evil maniacs intent on ruling the world, but also the only group in the setting
who knows how to make dracoliches. Their ritual requires a <em>living</em> dragon, but
Valindra is confident her pet cult can change it to work on ancient bones. And
if they can’t, she’ll find someone to resurrect the dragon first and <em>then</em> turn
it into a dracolich.</p>

<p>The cult, of course, is not happy about this. Its leader, Adimond Kroskas, is
being forced to work for Valindra because she stole his Ring of the Dragon,
which acts as his symbol of authority and is a powerful magical item in its own
right. He can’t call on his own superiors for help because they’ll destroy him
for losing the ring. He’s currently maintaining the loyalty of his underlings
because he’s promised to get the ring back. While he figures out a way to do it,
he and his cult are working to find a way to raise Lorragauth… as slowly as
possible.</p>

<p>At the same time, Valindra is still trying to find a way to properly “refuel”
the Dread Ring. One of her theories is that it might be possible to drain power
directly from Maegera to feed into the fortress. That would require finding a
new path to Gauntlgrym (the one they used in the novel has collapsed). If the
Netherese manage to fix Xinlenal, though, she might divert her efforts to
capturing it in order to use its mythalar engine as that power source.</p>

<p>A third goal they’re working towards is building up an undead army. They’ve
begun a mass grave-robbing operation in Neverwinter’s cemetery to produce
low-level undead to act as laborers and guards, and are sending the surplus back
to Thay to aid in their war with Netheril as well. They’re also established an
outpost in the crypts beneath Castle Never, where they are attempting to raise
an old group of heroes (the Neverwinter Nine) as powerful revenants.</p>

<h2 id="player-tie-ins">Player Tie-Ins</h2>

<p>The Renegade Red Wizard is our theme that’s on a collision course with the
Thayans, but others might also find themselves involved. People have started to
notice the grave-robbing and might contact someone like Oghma’s Faithful or the
Neverwinter Noble to help them solve this mystery.</p>

<p>The Uthgardt Barbarian would also be very interested in this as the Thayans are
a very likely suspect in the sacking of their holy burial mound.</p>

<p>Conversely, Oghma’s Faithful might be approached my mysterious but generous
patrons who wish to hire them to perform some important magical research…</p>

<p>Oh, we also get full stats for the stolen <strong>Ring of Dragons</strong>, which might make
a cool magic item for the PCs if they manage to acquire it. It’s a Level 7 Rare
item. Wearing it gives you the ability to speak, read, and write Draconic, and
to communicate telepathically with dragons in your line of sight. It also has
two active daily powers. One of them makes your location known to every evil
dragon within a day’s travel, which cultists use as a way to summon allies but
is likely to backfire for PCs. The other projects sustainable illusion of a
dragon of up to Gargantuan size within 40 squares of you. It can make sounds and
move, and generally does a convincing job of looking like you summoned an elder
dragon bodyguard. However it will pop like a soap bubble if it touches anything
or is hit by an attack.</p>

<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>

<p>New Neverwinter has just started to look into Thayan activities in the region,
and the Thayans have begun providing material support to the Sons of Alagondar
to thrown them off the trail.</p>

<p>Valindra knows the Abolethic Sovereignity has an operation in the region, but
that’s all she knows, and it makes her very angry. She’s begun sending people to
investigate.</p>

<p>The Thayans and Netherese are at war all over the Realms, and this area is no
exception. A lot of that undead manpower Valindra has been building up is being
used in an ongoing battle against the local Netherese operation.</p>

<p>She also has some conflicts with the Many-Arrows Orcs, who occasionally encroach
upon the Dread Ring and must be driven off.</p>

<p>And finally, you’ll notice that I did not mention the Ashmadai even once despite
Valindra living in their head rent-free over in the Ashmadai entry. That’s how
much she thinks of them. They are nothing more than disposable muscle to her.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>As we’ll see from the encounter table in the next post, the Thayans are clearly
set up to be one of the campaign’s final bosses - possibly <em>the</em> final boss if
they manage to animate Lorragauth. Valindra is the most powerful faction boss so
far even without the dragon, and their backstory does have a nice thematic link
to the event that started this whole situation in the first place.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The enemy table for the Ashmadai includes Heroic-tier devils and cambions from
several books, and also several humanoid opponents that could be reskinned as
cultists. We also get a few new stat blocks for cultists and devils, and for the
cult’s leaders.</p>

<h2 id="seared-devil">Seared Devil</h2>

<p>Looking like a stinky burned corpse, this devil hurls itself at its victims,
driven by envy of their uncooked state. It’s a Level 3 Soldier with 50 HP, speed
5, and Resist 10 Fire. Its basic attack is an <strong>Ashen Slam</strong> that damages and
marks for a turn on a hit. Enemies that ignore the mark are hit by the <strong>Choking
Ashes</strong> power, taking 5 fire damage and getting slowed for a turn.</p>

<h2 id="branded-zealot">Branded Zealot</h2>

<p>Those who get initiated into the cult are branded with the symbol of
Asmodeus. Most of them use this stat block. The typical zealot has a frightful
temper and is easily goaded into fights. They’re Level 4 Brutes with 66 HP.</p>

<p>Zealots attack in melee with a <strong>Branding Iron</strong> that deals fire damage, and at
range with a Range 3 <strong>Hellfire Chain</strong> spell that deals fire damage, pulls 2
squares, and slows for a turn on a hit.</p>

<p>Their special move is named <strong>Bow to Your Master</strong>, and it lets them do a
Hellfire chain attack followed by a Branding Iron attack if the target is
adjacent to them. It recharges when neither attack hits. If both of them do, the
target falls prone.</p>

<h2 id="hellfire-warlock">Hellfire Warlock</h2>

<p>A more discreet cultist, who got infernal warlock powers from deals with
Asmodeus. They’re better at concealing their brands and like to infiltrate enemy
centers to spy and sabotage them. They’re Level 4 Artillery with 48 HP.</p>

<p>The warlock’s <strong>Hellfire Affinity</strong> gives them +2 to defenses against enemies
who are taking ongoing fire damage. Both of their basic attacks (a <strong>dagger</strong>
for melee and a <strong>Hellfire</strong> bolt for ranged combat) damage and inflict ongoing
fire damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can release a <strong>Concussive Inferno</strong> in a Close
Burst 2, targeting enemies. On a hit, this deals fire and force damage, pushes
the targets 2 squares, and knocks them prone. On a miss it still deals half
damage and pushes 2 squares.</p>

<p>If a creature within 10 squares of the warlock is taking fire damage, they can
<strong>Ride the Fire</strong> as a move action (recharge 5+) and teleport to swap places
with them.</p>

<h2 id="fimbrul-devil">Fimbrul Devil</h2>

<p>Looks just like a seared devil, but is cold. These things hail from Nessus or
Cania, and it is said that someone who survives a fight with them suffers from
persistent chills for years afterwards. They’re Level 5 Controllers with 66 HP,
Speed 6 with Ice Walk, and Resist 10 to both fire and cold damage.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Icy Claws</strong> deal cold damage; their <strong>Icy Exhalation</strong> hits a Close
Blast 3, deals cold damage, and slows for a turn. Targets that were already
slowed are instead immobilized. Once per encounter they can encase a creature in
a <strong>Frozen Prison</strong> as a ranged attack, which deals cold damage and restrains
(save ends). On a miss, the target takes half damage and is immobilized (save
ends).</p>

<h2 id="mordai-vell">Mordai Vell</h2>

<p>The pleasant face of the cult, Mordai Vell is a tiefling aristocrat descended
from one of Neverwinter’s minor noble clans that was largely unaffected by the
cataclysm. This doesn’t give him a claim to the throne, but does leave him with
a lot of inherited wealth. His money and title make him an influent character in
the city’s politics, and his public reputation is generally good because he’s
almost as charismatic as he thinks he is. He sees Asmodeus not as his master,
but as a means to an end.</p>

<p>In addition to the deals and schemes detailed above, Vell is also dealing with a
duergar named Nimor Ironvoice who claims to have access to a source of
hellthorn, a special metallic alloy that is very easy to enchant with infernal
magic. He has people following Ironvoice around for a while now, but the duergar
is careful enough to avoid revealing his sources.</p>

<p>When faced in combat, Vell is a Level 6 Lurker with 60 HP and Resist 10
Fire. His basic melee attack is with a <strong>rod</strong> that damages and pushes 2
squares, but his special powers are the most interesting part about him.</p>

<p><strong>Fiery Corona</strong> attacks a Close Burst 2, dealing fire and force damage and
inflicting ongoing fire damage. <strong>Shrouded in Fire</strong> deals 5 automatic fire
damage to everyone adjacent to Mordai and lets him become invisible and teleport
5 squares. He remains invisible until he attacks or until the end of his next
turn. Using one of these powers recharges the other, so he’s going to alternate
them if possible.</p>

<h2 id="favria">Favria</h2>

<p>Favria had been enslaved by a far-away band of Asmodeus-worshiping duergar since
her birth. She escaped their service, but kept their faith. She made her way to
Neverwinter to search for Gauntlgrym, joining up with the local cult and rising
to a leadership position mostly through force and intimidation.</p>

<p>If Vell is the pleasant lie, Favria is the harsh reality of Asmodeus
worship. Instead of lies and intrigue, she prefers to deal with problems by the
direct application of violence. Still, she sees value in his way of doing
things, and cooperates by keeping herself and her underlings mostly out of
Neverwinter proper. They have a hideout in the ruins of the village of
Thundertree.</p>

<p>Unlike Vell, Favria knows exactly what the unholy relic of Asmodeus held by the
Thayans is capable of, which is why she is so intent on recovering it. She’s
also still looking for Gauntlgrym. She is unaware that it’s currently occupied
by Asmodeus-worshiping duergar, and her reaction to that discovery is
unpredictable. Will she readily cooperate with her fellows in faith, or will she
try to kill them to avenge her suffering at the hands of a similar group?</p>

<p>Favria is a Level 5 Skirmisher with 68 HP. She has Resist 5 to fire and poison,
and fights using a pair of custom <strong>bladed hand crossbows</strong> that can be used in
melee or at range. The melee attack deals extra damage if the target grants
combat advantage, and the ranged attack fires <strong>poisoned bolts</strong> that damage and
inflict ongoing poison damage (save ends). <strong>Dual Assault</strong> lets her make one of
each attack once per encounter, recharging if neither hits.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I did say I wasn’t inclined to make the Ashmadai a major thread but if I still
wanted them to have a bit of staying power I’d probably tone down Mordai Vell’s
personality.</p>

<p>As written, his demeanor is so Trump-like any players here in 2023 will
immediately figure out he’s a bad guy and do their best to gank him early. That
might bring some attention from the other factions, but would remove the cult
itself as an effective threat.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Since before the cataclysm that destroyed the city, the Neverwinter region was
being infiltrated by the Ashmadai, a particularly powerful cult of
Asmodeus. There’s a lot of backstory here, which seems to tie into to a Drizz’t
novel. Let’s try to go over it quickly.</p>

<p>So back before the Cataclysm, the Ashmadai mostly worked as flunkies for the
Thayans, because the Thayan leader Szass Tam had in his possession a scepter
believed to be an unholy relic of Asmodeus. They were the wizards’ muscle when
they tried to destroy Neverwinter to build the Dread Ring, their super
necromantic fortress.</p>

<p>After that plan fell through in a Drizz’t novel, the Thayans fled the area and
left the Ashmadai to their own devices until recently, when this Thayan lich
named Valindra came back and announced she was the unholy scepter’s new owner,
demanding the cultists’ loyalty.</p>

<p>The cult now finds itself split into two sub-factions:</p>

<p>The traditionalists are older and less educated, and serve out of genuine faith
in their evil god. They’re okay with going back to being Thayan flunkies because
of the scepter, which they value highly. They’re led by a dwarf named Favria.</p>

<p>The “new guard” is less religious and a lot more pragmatic. They want to retain
their independence and rule the region themselves. They’re led by a tiefling
named Mordai Vell.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>Those two sub-factions are actually quite friendly with each other. Their
leaders meet regularly, even though their lower-ranking members have no
contact. Favria will happily leave the Thayans’ service if Vell can steal the
scepter from them. Vell also wants to capture Valindra’s soul vessel, which will
let him extract some payback from the lich for all the abuse she has been
heaping upon them.</p>

<p>Once they’ve attained their independence, the Ashmadai plan to move on to
dominating the region. What exactly this means is up to the GM, and will inform
their strategies. Do they want to rule the region openly as its new imperial
masters? Do they want to establish themselves as a “legitimate” religion and
rule that way? Do they want to be a power behind the throne? Do they want to
harness Maegera’s power to do so?</p>

<p>That said, the Ashmadai are by far the weakest of the major factions from this
book, so a lot of their more immediate goals revolve around fixing that and
avoiding the notice of the others.</p>

<p>The pragmatist faction operates mostly from the shadows. Mordai Vell established
a complex system of cells or “pods”, where the highest-ranking leaders report to
him but don’t know each other, and this structure repeats down each leader’s
hierarchy all the way down to the dumb muscle on the ground.</p>

<p>The traditionalist faction is more direct and violent, though they mostly keep
out of town unless called upon. In areas already under their control, they paint
their symbol on buildings and alleys as a way to remind the local populace who’s
boss.</p>

<p>Like the aboleths, the Ashmadai are fond of kidnapping people. Their victims
become sacrifices in a peculiar arrangement they have with their diabolic
patron. For each devil they summon into the world, they must also bind a mortal
to a devil’s spirit. These possessed individuals can look like mortals while
using devil stats, or use their original stats with the addition of a couple of
thematic powers. I guess this devil-summoning must be the Ashmadai’s primary
means of increasing their firepower, but since those possessions are framed as
the <em>price</em> of the summonings I’m guessing the possessed are not directly
beholden to the cult’s hierarchy. Whether it’s possible to rescue them
from this possession is up to the GM.</p>

<h2 id="player-tie-ins">Player Tie-Ins</h2>

<p>The Devil’s Pawn is on a collision course with the Ashmadai, who will make big
efforts to recruit them. They will also go after people who look like they can
rise to positions of power in Neverwinter, like the Noble.</p>

<p>Whether the cult tries to actively recruit the PCs or not, they can certainly
use their services against the aboleth menace. PCs who would never accept
working with diabolists might be approached by disguised agents intending to
point them at their enemies.</p>

<p>It’s not actually stated anywhere within this entry, but other places in the
book say the Ashmadai control the above-ground portion of Oghma’s temple,
meaning Oghma’s Faithful is very likely to end up fighting them.</p>

<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>

<p>The Ashmadai are hard at work trying to infiltrate New Neverwinter, but they
haven’t managed to make any progress with Mayor Soman Galt (who, as we saw, is a
pawn of the aboleths already). Mordai himself is busily trying to convert
General Sabine of New Neverwinter to his cause, and has a good shot of managing
this as her natural disposition is compatible with the cult’s.</p>

<p>The Abolethic Sovereignity is the competition, and they’re ahead. The cultists
ideally want to seal the chasm leading to their base, or otherwise drive them
off permanently, but they’re not even close to accomplishing this. The only
reason the Ashmadai are still around is that the aboleths don’t consider them a
serious threat.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the Ashmadai are nominally serving the Thayans while looking
for a way to break free of that servitude. They only do the minimum to prevent
Valindra from suspecting them, but their rebellious plot is doomed to failure as
Valindra does not have that relic scepter any more - she shipped it back to
Szass Tam as soon as she was done showing it off.</p>

<p>The cult looks at the Netherese with much more genuine awe, though. They’ve
begun holding secret talks to forge an alliance, though they’re still having to
keep that hidden from the Thayans.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>As far as major factions go the Ashmadai are kinda weak. All of their major
goals and strategies lead them down a path that ends in a face-first collision
with one of the factions. They can’t recover the scepter because it’s not here
any more. They can’t corrupt New Neverwinter entirely because the aboleths got
there first. The direct approach to conquest doesn’t work because all the other
would-be conquerors are stronger.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s a small chance that campaign events and PC actions end up
giving them a leg up, if only because the PCs open a power vacuum the cult can
exploit. I myself am not inclined to make them into a major threat, because it’s
always refreshing to have a group of villains you can easily stomp into the
ground.</p>

<p>Underwater adventuring is one of those things that older editions of Dungeons
and Dragons seemed to like more than their players did. Lots of monster books
included a selection of monsters that could only be encountered under the sea,
but every bit of commentary I read on those was always about how no one ever
bothered to include submarine delves in their campaigns. If a sea monster
couldn’t go up to the surface to attack a ship or climb on its deck, it was
usually ignored by GMs.</p>

<p>The Dungeon Fantasy lines learned this lesson well, and don’t spend a lot of ink
on support for underwater adventures. This was a big problem for me when I was
GMing Hell’s Rebels to a group of friends. This particular adventure path
follows the old tradition of making PCs spend a chunk of levels 5-8
underwater. When I got to that part in my GURPS conversion, I had no idea what
to do and got a bit stressed out trying to figure this out on the spot.</p>

<p>Frantically researching rules in real time is no fun at all even when I am the
only player, so for the benefit of my solo Hell’s Rebels game and any future
run-throughs with actual players, I’m going to collect everything I know about
fighting underwater in GURPS right here in this post.</p>

<p>I admit I don’t have all the officially published primary sources that discuss
underwater adventuring. The ones I’m using are <strong>DF: Exploits</strong> and the
simplified rules that can be found in <a href="https://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com/2019/01/simplified-df-underwater-combat-revised.html">Dungeon Fantastic</a>, which <em>do</em>
reference the sources I don’t have.</p>

<h2 id="underwater-fighting-for-land-lubbers">Underwater Fighting For Land-Lubbers</h2>

<p>If you’re not an aquatic creature, you use these rules when fighting underwater.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your Move is limited to your Swimming move: Basic Speed/5, minimum 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All of your skills are capped at the level of your DX-based <strong>Swimming</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thrusting and unarmed strikes receive no penalties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some grappling techniques won’t work. Others work as normal. GM adjudicates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Swinging attacks with Reach 1+ weapons are impossible. This does cover pretty
much every weapon listed in DF: Adventurers, as even small knives have a Reach
of “C, 1” when swung.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shield bashes are -2 x DB to hit and do half damage. Don’t bother trying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blocks are impossible but you still get your shield’s DB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parries with Reach 1+ weapons are impossible. Parries with close-combat-only
weapons like daggers, and unarmed parries, are allowed and suffer no
penalties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dodge is possible and not penalized, but you can’t Retreat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No thrown ranged attacks, even from Missile spells. Special underwater ranged
weapons exist and use specific stats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ranged attacks into our out of water have -4 to hit, 1/10 range, and do half
damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All through this, you’ll be holding your breath under Heavy Exertion (DF:
Exploits p. 21)!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="underwater-fighting-for-fish-and-fish-people">Underwater Fighting for Fish and Fish-People</h2>

<p>Water adaptation in GURPS has two main components. One is the ability to
<em>breathe</em> underwater. The other is the ability to <em>move freely</em> while
submerged.</p>

<p>In monsters, the first is handled by traits such as <strong>Gills</strong>, some variety of
<strong>Doesn’t Breathe</strong>, or the ability to hold their breath for a really long time
even in combat. A combatant with one of these traits doesn’t need to worry about
the standard Breath Holding rules.</p>

<p>The second is handled by the <strong>Amphibious</strong> or <strong>Aquatic</strong> traits. If you have
one of these traits, you get a lot of advantages over land-lubbers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your get to use your full Move and skills, not limited by your Swimming.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are exempt from most skill penalties from being underwater and from many
Swimming tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can Retreat!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your other attacks and defenses are limited as for land-lubbers. This is
important for weapon users, not so much for aquatic beasts.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="from-delver-to-diver">From Delver to Diver</h2>

<p>If you’re a typical delver belonging to one of DFRPG’s standard ancestries, then
you fall squarely in the “land-lubber” category, and you have to solve a couple
of problems before you can dive in.</p>

<h3 id="breathing">Breathing</h3>

<p>If you don’t want your underwater life expectancy to be measured in seconds, you
need to find a way to breathe in there. In most typical DF settings, that means
magic.</p>

<h4 id="spells">Spells</h4>

<p>The DFRPG boxed set includes two main drowning-prevention measures: the
<strong>Breathe Water</strong> and <strong>Hold Breath</strong> spells. They have different
prerequisite chains but work the same, letting you ignore that part of the rules
for as long as they last. Both have a base duration of 1 minute and an energy
cost of 4 to cast and 2 to maintain, reduced by skill as normal. Hold Breath
is a little better because it also let you survive in non-watery environments.</p>

<p>Their main disadvantage is that their duration is relatively short. Unless the
PC casting these spells has a skill of 20 or more with them, the affected
character is only going to be able to remain underwater for a few minutes at a
time. That’s nowhere near enough for a full delve, and it’s an even shorter time
if you need to maintain this spell for multiple PCs. If the caster <em>does</em> have
skill 20 then things get a lot easier, but that costs a lot of points.</p>

<h4 id="items">Items</h4>

<p>If we expand our scope a little to look at DF supplements, then we see that
Dungeon Fantasy Magic Items 1 has an alchemical <strong>Water-Breathing Amulet</strong>. You
can breathe underwater as long as you wear it… but it costs an amazing
$23.400. Outfitting a party of 5 with that is a very expensive proposition,
unless you find them as treasure.</p>

<p>A reusable casting item like a wand or ring with the Breathe Water spell would
cost at least $8200. This basic version would be powered by the user, so it has
the same duration limits as the spell. Doubling the price would halve the energy
cost, which is better but not perfect.</p>

<p>However, if we expand our scope even further and break out of the DFRPG bubble,
we can go to GURPS Magic and find an alchemical <strong>water-breathing elixir</strong> that
costs $600 in a setting with common magic and gives you the ability to breathe
water for 1d hours! Even a minimal roll gives you a nice amount of time to
explore, and per that book’s rules you’ll know the duration is about to expire 5
minutes in advance, which is better than nothing.</p>

<p>That elixir is clearly the best approach for campaigns where underwater delves
are a sometimes thing. They’re a little less convenient than the amulet, but the
price can’t be beat. I’m definitely including this in my campaign.</p>

<h3 id="moving">Moving</h3>

<p>Unless your delvers are willing to spend the time and points to become
better-than-Olympic swimmers, solving their underwater movement issues also
means resorting to magic.</p>

<h4 id="spells-1">Spells</h4>

<p>DF: Spells gives us two options here: <strong>Swim</strong> and <strong>Ethereal Body</strong>. The first
makes the subject effectively Amphibious, the second makes them intangible and
thus able to ignore all that water. GURPS Magic additionally gives us <strong>Walk
Through Water</strong>, which makes the user intangible only to water and ice. This
means you don’t enjoy 3D movement while underwater… but your maneuvers in
combat are unrestricted! I think I can kinda see why this one didn’t make the
cut to the DFRPG.</p>

<p>As with water-breathing, our biggest limitation here are spell maintenance
costs, which limit our unimpeded movement to a few minutes at most. These are
also harder to completely eliminate, since Ethereal Body costs 4 energy per
minute to maintain and the others cost 3. Still, a caster could conceivably save
these for when a fight is about to start, and only cast it on the group’s
physical fighters.</p>

<h4 id="magic-items">Magic Items</h4>

<p>I couldn’t find an always-on item with a Swim enchantment in the books I own. A
basic casting item for Swim will cost at least $20500, almost as expensive as
the always-on water breathing amulet. Lowering its casting/maintenance cost from
6/3 to 3/2 doubles the price, lowering it to 2/1 quadruples it.</p>

<p>We might built this as a charged item instead, with each charge giving you 2
minutes of Swim time and costing 9 energy. A non-rechargeable item would cost
$1350 per charge, a rechargeable one $2700 (plus $180 per charge to reload).</p>

<p>If Walk Through Water is allowed in the campaign, an item with the same duration
per charge would be a tad cheaper: $910/$1820/$140.</p>

<p>In any of these cases, the item is best used sparingly, in the same manner as
the spell. You activate it when it’s time for a big fight or a crucial skill
test, and rely on your Swimming lessons the rest of the time.</p>

<h2 id="optimal-strategies">Optimal Strategies</h2>

<p>Given all of the above, I think we can pretty easily arrive at an “optimal”
strategy for underwater expeditions.</p>

<p>If your group is about to embark in a <strong>campaign centered around underwater
delving</strong>, your PC party should include a caster who can use Breathe Water at
Skill-20, and also someone who can use Swim at Skill-15. A druid or wizard could
do both, a cleric can use Breathe Water and leave Swim to someone else. This is
a hefty investment, but worth it for the amount of use they’ll get out of
it. Every PC, caster or not, should also consider investing points into the
Swimming skill, because it can help conserve spell energy and is pretty useful
in itself. You might want to give them extra points for these purposes depending
on your desired power level.</p>

<p>An alternative here is for you to allow players to make PCs from ancestries that
have an easy time underwater. Both Sea Elves from GURPS DF 3 and <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html">Argonians</a>
from this blog have Gills and are Amphibious. <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/17/dfrpg-warforged.html">Warforged</a> are a bit less
nimble but don’t need to breathe at all. Each delver who is a natural-born diver
will make the rest of the party’s life that much easier. For those who aren’t,
Water-Breathing Amulets make excellent treasure.</p>

<p>If you’re planning a standard campaign that features a <strong>one-off underwater
dungeon</strong>, Water-Breathing Elixirs are the way to go, possibly supplemented by
one or two rechargeable Wands of Swimming. The elixirs should definitely be
easily available in a nearby town (perhaps it’s a coastal fishing village?). The
wands might be for sale as well, or might be found as treasure either before or
during the delve. Proper safety procedure is to carry two elixirs per
PC, saving the second one for the return trip if the first one wears off.</p>

<p>If you only have <strong>isolated underwater encounters</strong>, we’re back to learned
spells, but they don’t need to have high levels. The submerged environment
becomes an additional challenge, but no one is going to spend too long inside
it.</p>

<p>Hell’s Rebels in particular fits the second category, so I’ll be using that
solution.</p>
