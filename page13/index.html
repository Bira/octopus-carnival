        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Golems showed up in the first MM and were iconic enough to later make it to the
Monster Vault. I covered those <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/30/golem.html">here</a>, and you can check that same post to
see their basic lore. The Monster Manual 2 brings us yet more golems, which
share the same basic lore.</p>

<p>As before, golems are Natural Animates with the Construct keyword. They’re
immune to disease, poison, and sleep. They have darkvision, and though their
ground speed tends to be high they cannot shift. Most are Large, but one of the
examples here is Huge.</p>

<h2 id="bone-golem">Bone Golem</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-golem-bone.png"/>

</figure>

<p>Bone golems are made from the skeletons of several creatures, whose bones are
sharpened and fitted together to form the construct’s body. Despite being made
of bones and beloved of necromancers, it’s a construct animated through
elemental magic and not an undead monster. Throw this one into an encounter that
does have undead skeletons in it, and it should be good to surprise your PCs a
bit.</p>

<p>Bone Golems are Level 12 Elite Brutes with 302 HP. It’s so spiky the pointy bits
count as a <strong>Bone Spikes</strong> aura (1) that deals 5 damage to any enemy that enters
it. The pointy bits also justify the <strong>Osseous Retaliation</strong> trait, which deals
a bit of automatic damage to anyone who hits the golem with an opportunity
attack.</p>

<p>This construct fights with Reach 2 <strong>Bone Spurs</strong>, and can attack twice per
action with them. It can also fire a <strong>Bone Volley</strong> (burst 3 vs. Reflex,
recharge 6+) that deals heavy physical damage and dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>When the golem is destroyed <strong>Bone Death</strong> allows it to make one last
attack. If Bone Spurs is charged then it uses that, otherwise it makes a basic
bone spur attack.</p>

<h2 id="chain-golem">Chain Golem</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-golem-chain.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These Huge golems are modeled after chain devils, and are often tasked to guard
prisons and Actual Dungeons instead of the usual tombs or treasure vaults. As
you might have guessed, their fighting style is very grapple-intensive.</p>

<p>Chain Golems are Level 22 Elite Soldiers with 418 HP, a speed of 8, and all
standard golem traits. Their <strong>Entangling Chains</strong> act as an aura (3) that slows
everyone caught inside.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 3 <strong>Chain</strong> that does physical damage and pulls
the target 2 squares. <strong>Chain Smash</strong> is their double attack power, allowing it
to attack two different targets in one action. While they’re bloodied, <strong>Berserk
Attack</strong> allows them to make a chain strike against anyone who damages them as a
reaction.</p>

<p>All that and we didn’t even use the grappling rules yet! We have to do that for
<strong>Chain Grab</strong>, though. This at-will attack is a Close Burst 2 that does the
same damage as the basic strike, pulls targets 1 square, and grabs them. The
escape DC is 32 or 35 depending on the skill you use. The golem can move away
from the grabbed victims without ending the grab because chains. Once it
finishes moving it can either slide the victims next to itself or let them go.</p>

<p>So your typical chain golem will try to keep the whole party grabbed while it
smacks them around with its chains. PCs who aren’t grabbed will still be slowed,
and the golem’s strikes will pull them back if they try to run away. Staying far
away and using ranged attacks is a good tactic against them, but that speed of 8
will make keeping away a real chore.</p>

<h2 id="clay-golem">Clay Golem</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-golem-clay.png"/>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Clay Golems were one of the original golem types described in the first entries
back in AD&amp;D or in the nebulous times before it. They were originally inspired
by the legend of the golem of Prague, and so were the only golem that required
divine magic to make (all the others were arcane).</p>

<p>In Fourth Edition, <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/12/eidolon.html">eidolons</a> are used to represent divine constructs, so
clay golems have the same arcane/elemental origin as the other types. They have
a somewhat “runny” appearance, but are surprisingly fast and retain a slightly
less harsh version of the ability to inflict unhealing wounds that they had in
previous incarnations.</p>

<p>Stat-wise, they’re Level 15 Elite Brutes with 368 HP, Large size, a speed of 6,
and all common golem traits. Their basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Slam</strong> that does
heavy physical damage and curses the target, making it unable to regain HP. This
is a (save ends) condition, but it’s still quite dangerous, since it makes
wounds inflicted by <em>all</em> enemies unhealing, not just the golem’s. <strong>Clay
Smash</strong> allows it to slam two different targets in one action, and they have the
same Berserk Attack reaction as the chain golem above.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Hasty Reaction</strong> passive trait allows them to roll initiative twice and
take the highest result, and <strong>Unstoppable</strong> is a move-action encounter power
that allows them to move 8 squares and pass through enemy spaces. They draw
opportunity attacks when doing this, but reduce their damage by 10. This isn’t
worded like a resistance, so I guess powers that bypass or reduce resistances
don’t work against it.</p>

<h2 id="iron-golem">Iron Golem</h2>

<p>These made it into the MV, so we already covered them. The MM2 has two versions,
the Level 20 one that we saw, and a Level 26 “Iron Golem Juggernaut” that’s
basically the same aside from being size Huge and having bigger numbers.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Each kind of golem presented here gets a sample encounter. I guess there was
something of an editing snafu here, because most golems have their encounter
listed right after their stats, but the one for chain golems is all by its
lonesome in an “Encounter Groups” section at the end of the overall entry. I
guess it must be there because it has two golem types in it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 1 bone golem, 4 horde ghouls (minions), 1 human wizard lich. So
that’s the kind of caster who makes bone golems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 1 clay golem, 1 shadar-kai gloom lord, 2 shadow snakes. A Zehiri
operation, if you still want to associate clay golems with clerics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 21: 1 chain golem, 1 dark naga, 1 iron golem. Someone <em>really</em> wanted
this place guarded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 24: 1 iron golem juggernaut, 1 storm gorgon, 1 djinn skylord. A noble,
his pet, and his mechanical manservant.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a point past which adding more golem types feels a bit redundant. There
are also so many non-golem constructs out there that I almost think “golem”
should be a singular monster type with very specific characteristics, rather
than a whole family of them. Otherwise it would be best to do away with the term
entirely.</p>

<p>D&amp;D Fourth Edition uses “Goblins” to describe a set of closely related species
of humanoids: actual goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. They’re a very
traditional component of the game and we looked at lots of them in the
MM1/Monster Vault Let’s Read. The post covering their basic lore is <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/22/goblinoids.md">here</a>.</p>

<p>Since the first Manual covered them so well, the second brings us a small number
of more specialized stat blocks for them.</p>

<h2 id="bugbear-wardancer">Bugbear Wardancer</h2>

<p>Wardancers are specialized martial artists. Their weapon of choice is a
two-handed heavy flail, which they swing in wide arcs while moving through enemy
forces in the battlefield. The end result looks something like a dance, thus the
name. There’s a religious element to the art: there are different schools
organized around the worship of different exarchs of Bane, who compete among
each other to see whose war dance is the best.</p>

<p>The wardancer presented here is a Level 6 Skirmisher with 70 HP, low-light
vision, and Speed 7. Its basic attack is a <strong>Flail Dance</strong> that does physical
damage and has a lot of stacked riders: it pushes the target 2 square and knocks
it prone, and also allows the bugbear to shift 1 square. Yes, this is an at-will
basic attack.</p>

<p>The wardancer also has a couple of special attacks. <strong>Flail Barrier</strong> (recharge
5+) does a bit of automatic damage in a burst 2 around the bugbear, and makes it
take half damage from weapon attacks until the end of its next turn. <strong>Flail
Assault</strong> (close burst 2 vs Reflex; encounter) does a bit more damage and knocks
those it hits prone.</p>

<p>All the wardancer’s attacks deal extra damage if it has combat advantage against
the target.</p>

<h2 id="goblin-acolyte-of-maglubyet">Goblin Acolyte of Maglubyet</h2>

<p>Another martial artist, this one a goblin from a sect devoted to Maglubyet. In
previous editions (and again on 5th), Maglubyet is the main goblinoid deity, but
here he’s one of Bane’s Exarchs. His acolytes seek to make themselves in his
image.</p>

<p>The Acolyte is a Level 1 Controller with 29 HP, Speed 6, and low-light
vision. They wield a battleaxe in combat, and back it up with a bit of divine
magic.</p>

<p>Acolytes are surrounded by a <strong>Life Scourge</strong> aura (2) that prevents enemies
inside from recovering hit points. Their basic attack is a <strong>Slashing Shroud</strong>
that consists of an axe strike that also makes the acolyte invisible to the
target until the end if the acolyte’s next turn. A good option against PC
defenders.</p>

<p>They can attack at range with the <strong>Hand of Maglubyet</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Fortitude), a telekinetic attack that deals force damage and either slides
the target 3 squares or immobilizes it for a turn. <strong>Maglubyet’s Fists</strong>
(recharge 5+) allows them to use this attack twice in a single action. So as far
as martial artists go, this is one of those annoying hadouken spammers.</p>

<p>The acolyte also has the standard <strong>Goblin Tactics</strong> power that allows it to
shift 1 square as a reaction when missed by a melee attack. This is what you
would change if you were making acolytes of other species.</p>

<h2 id="lolthbound-goblin">Lolthbound Goblin</h2>

<p>Goblins are generally big on Bane worship, but that’s not universal among
them. This is a goblin whose people have been slaves to the drow for
generations. Their training, and even their physiology, have some important
differences from your usual goblins. They’re clearly meant to be encountered
alongside drow, though for that to work out you’ll need to make those drow lower
level or the goblin higher level.</p>

<p>As written, the Lolthbound Goblin is a Level 3 Soldier with 45 HP. They have
speed 6, and replace the usual low-light vision with full darkvision. They wear
light armor and fight with a war pick.</p>

<p>When Lolthbound Goblins are within 5 squares of a drow, they gain a +2 bonus to
all their attacks and defenses. That <strong>pick</strong> is a high-crit weapon and marks
targets for a turn on a hit. Once per encounter they can use a <strong>Stinging Blow</strong>
that deals poison damage and instead of marking increases any ongoing poison
damage the target is taking by 5. This synergizes with the poisoned weapons drow
so often carry.</p>

<p>Also once per encounter they can use a <strong>Lolthbound Shriek</strong> (close blast 5
vs. Fortitude), which deals light thunder damage to anyone in the area who is
not a drow or spider.</p>

<p>Aside from the usual Goblin Tactics reaction, they also have <strong>Drow Protector</strong>,
an interrupt where the goblin throws himself in front of a drow that’s just been
targetted by an attack, becoming the target instead.</p>

<h2 id="lolthbound-goblin-slave">Lolthbound Goblin Slave</h2>

<p>This is a Level 12 Minion Skirmisher version of the lolthbound goblin above,
which makes it appropriate for use with drow without the need for level
adjustments. They’re also armed with war picks, and add a hand crossbow to their
loadout.</p>

<p>Their basic melee attack is a <strong>Stinging Pick</strong>, which works just like the
Stinging Blow from the regular version. Their basic <strong>crossbow</strong> attack deals a
bit more damage if they’ve moved 3 or more squares before making it.</p>

<p>They also gain the attack and defense bonus from being near drow, and have
Goblin Tactics.</p>

<h2 id="hobgoblin-fleshcarver">Hobgoblin Fleshcarver</h2>

<p>This is the hobgoblin specialized martial artist. Unlike the bugbear and goblin
examples, fleshcarvers don’t seem to have a religious component to their
training. It’s all about hard work and crafting your own custom-fitted
weapons. Their weapons of choice are a polearm and a set of poisoned throwing
darts, whose poison is harvested from serpents they hunt as part of their
training. Fleshcarvers never refuse a challenge to combat, though they’re smart
enough to not let such a challenge distract them in the middle of an ongoing
battle.</p>

<p>Fleshcarvers are Level 6 Elite Controllers with 146 HP. They have Speed 6 and
low-light vision, wear heavy armor, and are armed with the afore-mentioned
specialized weapons.</p>

<p>Their stance and movements act as an aura (2) named <strong>Fleshcarver’s Trap</strong>,
dealing 5 damage to any enemy inside the first time they move during their
turn. Their <strong>glaive</strong> is reach 2 and is used both for basic attacks and for an
at-will <strong>Glaive Flurry</strong> that targets all enemies in a close burst 2, does more
damage than the basic attack, and slides targets 2 squares.</p>

<p>At range they can throw those <strong>Toxic Darts</strong> to do a bit of poison damage and
slow the target (save ends). If the target was already slowed, it’s immobilized
instead. When they’re hit by a melee attack, they can use their reaction to
shift 2 squares and make a dart attack. And finally, fleshcarvers have the same
Hobgoblin Resilience and Phalanx Soldier powers from MM1 hobgoblins.</p>

<p>These hobgoblins are more effective when lots of enemies are in reach, but the
selective targetting on their area attack means they engage all those enemies
while fighting in formation for that sweet defense bonus from Phanlanx Soldier.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>These new goblinoid specialists can be inserted into any goblin encounter, and
being goblins themselves also work well with any of their typically allied
creatures. These are the encounters we get on the book:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 1: 1 goblin acolyte, 3 goblin warriors, 1 Lolthbound Goblin. It’s likely
the whole group are drow slaves, with the LBG being their leader. The level
math works out, but the LBG’s drow-related skills are wasted here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 2 bugbear wardancers, 2 bugbear warriors, 1 barghest battle lord. A
warlord and their bodyguards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 1 fleshcarver, 3 hobgoblin soldiers, 2 dire wolves. A patrol with a
little extra kick to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 4 lolthbound goblin slaves, 1 drow priest, 2 blade spiders, 2 drow
warriors. Lots of poison being thrown around on this one, which makes the
minions more dangerous than their level would indicate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like these new additions, because their stat blocks are interesting and their
associated lore fleshes goblin culture out a bit more. I like that they’re
complex enough to have multiple martial styles.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/09/01/gnome.html">Let&#39;s Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Gnome</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Gnomes were introduced in the first Monster Manual, and you can see the post I
did on them <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/21/gnome.html.">here</a>. By the time the MM2 came out, they were already available
as a playable option in the Player’s Handbook 2.</p>

<p>We get three new gnome stat blocks in this entry, but one of them (the Gnome
Entropist) also appeared in the Monster Vault and so was covered in the original
post. We’ll cover the other two here.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-mistwalker">Gnome Mistwalker</h2>

<p>Gnome Mistwalkers are like the triple-classed fighter/illusionist/thieves of
yore. They’re skilled at illusion magic and melee combat, using those to ambush
their targets. This sort of training is common among gnome brigands, who build
elaborately disguised hideouts and strike at merchants passing along nearby
trade routes.</p>

<p>Mistwalkers are Level 5 Lurkers with 51 HP and all standard gnome traits
(including the Fade Away and Reactive Stealth powers described in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/21/gnome.html.">original
post</a>). They wear light armor and wield picks in combat.</p>

<p>The <strong>picks</strong> have the High-Crit property, and they deal extra damage to targets
granting them combat advantage. <strong>Mistwalker’s Strike</strong> (recharge 4+) allows
them to become invisible until the end of their next turn, shift 2 squares, and
make a pick attack in that order. This means the attack will always benefit from
the extra damage, and won’t disrupt the invisibility.</p>

<p>In addition to the two standard powers, they have a third defensive ability in
the form of <strong>Blur of Movement</strong>, a reaction that allows them to teleport 1
square when hit by an enemy.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-entropist">Gnome Entropist</h2>

<p>Their mechanics were covered in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/21/gnome.html.">original post</a>, but here we get a bit of
extra lore on them. Entropists are magicians whose power flows from the
Elemental Chaos. This tends to interfere with their natural link to the Feywild,
so they’re not usually the most stable of gnomes.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-wolverine">Gnome Wolverine</h2>

<p>This gnome is the best at what it does, and what it does ain’t pretty, bub. And
that’s pretty much all you need to know to understand this short berserker.</p>

<p>Wolverine is a Level 9 Skirmisher with 95 HP, lightly armored and wielding an
axe. His natural speed of 5 becomes 7 on a charge, and he has a +3 to AC against
opportunity attacks plus the standard gnome powers.</p>

<p>That <strong>axe</strong> can be used for basic strikes and for an <strong>Unbalancing Swipe</strong> that
does the same damage, slides the target 2 squares on a hit and knocks then prone
on a critical. When the Wolverine drops an enemy to 0 HP, <strong>Vicious Fury</strong>
allows him to shift 5 squares and gain a +3 bonus to damage rolls until the end
of his next turn. Once per encounter, and once again after being bloodied,
Wolverine can use a <strong>Shrieking Strike</strong> that’s much stronger than the basic
attack and does a bit of splash damage to an enemy adjacent to the target. Hit
or miss, it grants Wolverine a +3 bonus to all defenses until the end of his
next turn. This can be used as part of a charge.</p>

<p>Despite my joking, this Wolverine doesn’t regenerate.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 1 entropist, 2 wolverines, 2 spriggan giantsouls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 3 entropists, 2 phase spiders, 1 satyr piper, and 1 will-o’-wisp.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All seem to be the sort of gnome who’s up to no good, since they include the
dodgier sort of fey (spriggans/redcaps and the wisp).</p>

<p>I like 4e gnomes, so I liked seeing more of them. The wolverine is particularly
fun, because it goes so hard against type.</p>

            <p>The absolutely best thing about the Monster Manual 2 gnolls is that I don’t have
to talk about them! It turns out I’ve already covered them all in the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/20/gnoll.html">MM1/Monster Vault gnoll post</a>. The Deathpledged Gnoll, Fang of Yeenoghu, and
Gnoll Gorger that appeared in the Monster Vault all had their first appearances
here in the MM2. Just read the original article for everything you need to know
about 4e gnolls.</p>

            <p>The first Monster Manual and the Monster Vault contained plenty of giants, whose
lore in 4e is pretty awesome. I covered their basic lore <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/30/giants.html">here</a>, and also had
individual posts for <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/01/earth-giants.html">hill</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/04/frost-giants.html">frost</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/06/fire-giants.html">fire</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/07/death-giants.html">death</a> and <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/10/storm-giants.html">storm</a>
giants.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual 2 added more giants, and it’s actually where Frost Giants
made their first appearance in this edition. We already covered them in the
corresponding post linked above. In this one, we’ll cover the two other
varieties introduced in the same entry: Eldritch and Stone giants. The latter
are old standbys, and I had never heard of the former until now. If they existed
in a previous edition, it was in one of the more out-of-the-way supplements or
Dragon articles for 3e.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the basic lore post, the primordials made the first Giants from
the same elements they used in the world, to help them shape and understand
it. Well, it turns out <em>raw magic</em> is as much a basic building block of the
world as the more classical elements of earth, fire, air, and water. Therefore,
it got its own Giant type.</p>

<p>Eldritch giants were among the most powerful creations of the Primordials, and
they helped a lot with shaping the flow of magical energies in the still-cooling
world. Today their power is much diminished from what it was at the dawn of
time, and most of them dedicate their lives to accumulating magical power and
knowledge in hopes of returning to those lofty heights.</p>

<p>Both eldritch giants and titans are still well-versed in magic. They know how to
form weapons out of pure force, and they tattoo their bodies with symbols that
allow them to absorb the magic of others and teleport at will. They live near
sources of arcane power, and jealously hoard knowledge and artifacts. Eldritch
giant social hierarchy is based on how much power individuals managed to
accumulate - Eldritch Titans tend to be at the top. An individual eldritch giant
or titan might have more abilities than what is depicted in the “typical” stat
blocks of this entry, and they’ll certainly have access to lots and lots of
magic rituals.</p>

<p>Most interactions between mortals and eldritch giants as written here are likely
to be hostile, since the giants don’t have much reason to be friendly. They love
binding and enslaving other creatures with magic, though, so they might be
encountered alongside powerful elementals, slaads, and other such creatures. A
more reasonable group of them would make valuable allies against powerful
incorporeal enemies, though, since they specialize in force magic.</p>

<h3 id="eldritch-giant">Eldritch Giant</h3>

<p>“Standard” eldritch giants are Large Fey Humanoids with the “giant”
keyword, and Level 18 Skirmishers with 171 HP. They have low-light vision, 10
force resistance, and a +5 bonus to saves vs. charm effects. Their ground speed
is 8 and they also have a teleport speed of 6.</p>

<p>These giants fight in melee with Reach 2 <strong>Eldritch Blades</strong> that target Reflex
and deal force damage, and at range with Range 20 <strong>Force Missiles</strong> that do the
same. Being so large, they can also use <strong>Sweeping Sword</strong> attacks to target
everyone in a Close Blast 2 instead of a single victim, and they can do that
even when charging.</p>

<p>As a minor action, they can deploy an <strong>Eldritch Field</strong> (close blast 5; recharge
5+) that counts as difficult terrain and makes enemies inside take extra damage
from the their attacks. Also as a minor action, they can use <strong>Consume Magic</strong>
to absorb a magic zone created by a PC. This requires them to hit the caster’s
Will with an attack, and if they succeed their own attacks get a big damage
boost until the end of their next turn.</p>

<h3 id="eldritch-titan">Eldritch Titan</h3>

<p>Eldritch Titans are Huge, and Level 21 Elite Skirmishers with 394 HP. They have
the same passive traits as their smaller cousins.</p>

<p>Their Reach 3 <strong>Eldritch Hammers</strong> deal more damage, and they can make two
attacks per action, even on a charge. Their ranged force attack is also stronger
and pushes the target 5 squares on a hit.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can cast a <strong>Force Hammer</strong> that damages everyone on a
close blast 3, pushes then 3 squares and knocks them prone. On a miss the
targets still take half damage and are pushed. They have the same Consume Magic
and Eldritch Field abilities as eldritch giants.</p>

<h2 id="stone-giants">Stone Giants</h2>

<p>The other type of classic earth giant, Stone Giants are among the most
reasonable people among all giantkind. They usually don’t care about raiding or
conquest, and just want to be left alone in their mountain homes. Discrete and
contemplative sorts, they can stay immobile for years while lost in thought, and
are surprisingly adept at hiding themselves in their home terrain.</p>

<p>Someone passing throug stone giant territory might never spot them at all, and
ill-intentioned travelers might find themselves ambushed before they can do any
harm. The exception to all of this is when the giants are feeling rowdy and want
to have some fun: their favorite game is basically dodgeball with enormous
boulders, and when they’re in the middle of it they don’t usually pay attention
to any smaller creatures who might be in the path of those boulders.</p>

<p>Stone giants are one of the few Giants who are actually on friendly terms with
communities of galeb duhrs and azers. They have a long and proud tradition of
stone carving, and their magic is based on carved runes. It’s possible the
dwarves originally learned their own rune-magic from stone giants, though modern
dwarf scholars dispute this notion.</p>

<p>Friendly giants of other types, unable to stand their generally unpleasant
societies, often move in with stone giants. Conversely, evil stone giants tend
to move out of their ancestral homes and throw their lot with their more
villainous relatives.</p>

<p>Stone Giants are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Earth and Giant
keywords. They’re Level 14 Soldiers with 140 HP, immune to petrification, and
have a ground speed of 8 with Earth Walk. This lets them ignore difficult
terrain with a “geological” origin.</p>

<p>They use giant-sized <strong>stone greatclubs</strong>. As usual for soldiers, their basic
attacks mark on a hit and they can make opportunity attacks marked creatures in
reach that move or shift. They can also make a <strong>Staggering Sweep</strong> that works
like an area attack, pushes targets 2 squares, and marks them. At range, they
can <strong>hurl rocks</strong> like you’d expect out of an old-school giant.</p>

<p>While they’re unbloodied, they can use <strong>Stone Bones</strong> as an interrupt when hit
by an attack, gaining 5 resistance do its damage.</p>

<h3 id="stone-giant-runecarver">Stone Giant Runecarver</h3>

<p>This spellcaster is a Level 16 Controller with 155 HP and the Leader
keyword. Their magic is partly about slowing and immobilizing enemies, and
partly about doing unpleasant things to enemies suffering from those conditions.</p>

<p>They fight in melee with <strong>Enruned Picks</strong>, which are High-Crit weapons and have
a slow (save ends) rider. <strong>Grasping Stone</strong> ensures that any enemy slowed by
the giant is also immobilized for a turn.</p>

<p>Magic-wise, their <strong>Rune of Thundering Echo</strong> (recharge 5+) deals thunder damage
over an area and inflicts ongoing thunder damage (save ends) on targets who are
slowed or immobilized. The <strong>Rune of Stony Sleep</strong> (recharge 6+) affects a
similar area, deals physical damage and slows (save ends). After the first
failed save, slowed enemies become petrified instead (save still ends). That
rune also creates a zone within its affected area that inflicts a -2 penalty
against saves vs. slowness or immobilization effects.</p>

<p>“Save ends” petrification might not sound so bad, but runecarvers also have a
<strong>Hardened Focus</strong> aura (5) that makes all petrified enemies inside lose any
damage resistance they have <em>and</em> gain Vulnerable 5 to all damage. An evil
runecarver is a good counter to a group of PCs who thought a fight against frost
or fire giants was going to be easy just because they packed the right elemental
resistances.</p>

<h3 id="stone-titan">Stone Titan</h3>

<p>Stone Titans are basically Stone Giants Plus, being Huge in size and Level 18
Elite Soldiers with 348 HP. They fight unarmed and throw rocks, but there are
some important differences.</p>

<p>First, their marking ability is a <strong>Slipstone Distortion</strong> aura (1) that marks
any enemy who starts their turn inside. Their <strong>slams</strong> deal extra damage to
marked enemies, and they can make opportunity attacks against marked enemies
like stone giants can.</p>

<p>Second, they can use an <strong>Avalanche Stomp</strong> (encounter) to attack everyone in a
Close Burst 3, with a hit doing heavy damage and causing the very earth to grab
the targets. The escape DC is 28, and the giant doesn’t need to spend actions to
sustain the grab. A miss still does half damage.</p>

<p>And third, they can “charge” a thrown rock and turn it into a <strong>Quakestone</strong>
(recharge 5+), making it into an area attack that does light damage, knocks
prone, and dazes (save ends) on a hit. A miss does half damage and knocks prone
without the daze.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Eldritch giants have a somewhat unusual name and appearance when compared to the
traditional types, but they’re a lot closer to them than it seems at first. I
guess calling them “Force Giants” would have been a little too on the nose, but
this is basically what they are. They use Force attacks in the same way a frost
giant would use Cold, or a fire giant would use Fire. Their fighting style is
similar, aside from the “I eat magic!” thing.</p>

<p>Stone giants on the other hand are one of the traditional types that have been
there since the beginning. I’m happy to see them here because your average stone
giant fits the “Earth Giant” mold a lot more readily than a hill giant, who’s
just a big human-looking person. I also like that the book doesn’t consider all
of them evil, and even mentioned that they partner up with non-evil individuals
of the other giant types. I often ponder how to make sapient monsters less evil
and hostile when I discuss them, so it’s nice to see an entry that does that as
written.</p>
