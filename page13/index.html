<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Like the ghouls we just covered, fire giants are classic monsters that appeared
both in the original Monster Manual, and who would appear again in the upcoming
Monster Vault. The MM3 gives a selection of fire giant stat blocks that
complements that of the MV.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The lore for fire giants remains pretty much the same as it was <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/06/fire-giants.html">in the
MM/MV</a>. The new bits here add that the ancient fire giant empire had close
contact with the efreets of the Elemental chaos, and that their many volcano
fortresses were linked to each other and to the City of Brass via teleportation
circles and portals. Most of these portals are deactivated in the present day,
though the giants labor to reignite them wherever they find one.</p>

<p>As usual, fire giants love to team up with other fire creatures, preferrably
ones they can dominate and command. Some of them end up in the service of more
powerful masters like efreets or the older red dragons, but since fire giants
always think they should be the ones in charge they make for untrustworthy
subordinates.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Fire Giants are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Giant keyword. They have a
ground speed of 8 and Resist 15 Fire.</p>

<h3 id="fire-giant-lavamaster">Fire Giant Lavamaster</h3>

<p>Here’s a name that looks like it came from the writer’s 8-year-old
child. Lavamasters are… masters of lava! Their magic allows them to control
magma and use it both as a weapon, and to heal their allies. Lavamasters are
Level 17 Controllers with 164 HP and the Leader tag.</p>

<p>They project an aura (2) of <strong>Hearthflames</strong> that hurts enemies and bolsters
allies. Enemies caught inside take 10 fire damage; bloodied allies recover 10 HP
when they start their turns inside the aura. This is not any kind of “drain”
effect. Allies recover HP regardless of whether there are enemies to damage or
not.</p>

<p>The lavamaster attacks with a <strong>Molten Sword</strong> that deals fire damage, and can
also use several spells. <strong>Magma Lash</strong> is a ranged attack that deals a bit more
fire damage than the sword, and pulls the target 4 squares. If the target ends
up adjacent to the lavamaster, the giant grabs them. The spell recharges when
the giant has no target grabbed. <strong>Magma Burst</strong> is like an at-will
mini-fireball that leaves a fiery zone in its affected area. The zone lasts for
a turn, counts as difficult terrain, and deals fire damage to enemies inside.</p>

<p>If the lavamaster has an enemy grabbed, <strong>Fiery Vendetta</strong> allows the lavamaster
itself or one of its allies to make a free attack against that enemy whenever
the enemy attacks the lavamaster.</p>

<p>A good tactic here is to keep away and repeatedly fireball the enemy, grabbing
anyone who gets too close. Keep a Brute or two nearby as bodyguards so they can
make free attacks against the grabbed victim and benefit from that healing aura.</p>

<h3 id="fire-giant-flamedancer">Fire Giant Flamedancer</h3>

<p>This martial artist is trained in an ancient style developed by the efreets. It
combines mobile spear fighting with fire-based teleportation magic. Flamedancers
are Level 18 Skirmishers with 174 HP.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Nimble Reaction</strong> trait gives them +4 to AC vs. Opportunity Attacks, and
their <strong>Whirling Spear</strong> basic attack deals fire damage and allows them to shift
2 squares on a hit. They can also make at-will <strong>double attacks</strong>, which must be
against different targets.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can make a <strong>Flameburst Leap</strong> as a move action,
teleporting 8 squares and dealing automatic fire damage to any enemies adjacent
to them at the starting point.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t expect a giant to be this agile! The same stat block can be used
for a slightly lower-level efreet without much issue.</p>

<h3 id="fire-giant-smokecaller">Fire Giant Smokecaller</h3>

<p>Smokecallers are what passes for a “subtle” fire giant spellcaster. They
surround themselves in clouds of volcanic smoke, and attack by turning that
smoke into a pyroclastic cloud aimed at their enemies. It’s “subtle” without
necessarily being “stealthy”, unless you’re already in an environment naturally
choked with sulphurous smoke. Which is… actually a common situation when
you’re fighting fire giants.</p>

<p>Smokecallers are Level 19 Lurkers with 140 HP and a nice speed of 10. They fight
with a <strong>Smoldering Whip</strong> that has a fantastic reach of 5. It targets Reflex,
does fire damage, and pulls up to 3 squares on a hit.</p>

<p>Its main tactic consists of two abilities: <strong>Smokecloud</strong> creates a zone of
smoke in a Close Burst 3 that lasts for a turn. It blocks line of sight for all
creatures except the smokecaller. While inside this zone, the smokecaller can
use <strong>Cindersmoke</strong> to attack all enemies in a Close Blast 5. This deals fire
damage on a hit, and it ends the smokecloud immediately.</p>

<p>Both are standard actions, which means the lurkery routine here is Smokecloud
followed by Cindersmoke on the next turn. Cindersmoke does the same damage as a
whip attack to each target. This means the whip is only worth it if its forced
movement component would synergize with something. An example is when you have
multiple smokecallers and one of them wants to pull a PC into its buddy’s
upcoming Cindersmoke area.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Like the ghoul entry, this one feels like it was designed to fit together with
the (upcoming, at the time) Monster Vault. The giants here all use the same
improved math as the ones that would appear on the MV, and they fill roles which
the more “classic” MV lineup does not. Combining the two gives you enough
ready-made stat blocks to make a dungeon inhabited solely by fire giants, though
you might also want to sprinkle in some hell hounds, elementals, and enslaved
azer that just need that final push to revolt.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/08/08/coffee-machine-from-hell.html">Magic Item: The Coffee Machine From Hell</a>

            <p>I dreamed about this thing today, and what use is a blog if I can’t use it to
write about the weird things I dream up?</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>This looks like a chunky, tabletop coffee machine of the sort that can be made
at TL8, and which might be found in an office. It’s self-contained, with
internal reservoirs for beans and plastic cups. An authorized technician
supposedly refills those after working hours, but employees who stay late never
see this technician, no matter how late they stay. And yet, the machine never
seems to run out.</p>

<p>The device bears the name of a company that does indeed make this type of
appliance, though instead of their usual logo it has an upside-down star with a
smiley face. It has no model name or other contact information printed anywhere
on its body.</p>

<p>The Coffee Machine From Hell has a counter-intuitive control panel. Several
button presses are required to tell it what you want, but that’s just bad
interface design. The Machine’s true curse is more insidious.</p>

<p>As its name implies, the Coffee Machine From Hell is literally a torment device
built by demons. It will do its nominal job of producing cups of shitty office
coffee, but only if the user is making one for themselves (i.e, being
self-serving) or is thinking hostile or hateful thoughts about the intended
recipient of the drink. Someone who’s genuinely trying to help, or even just
being neutral about it, will find the machine seizes up or behaves
unpredictably. Even if all buttons are pressed correctly, it will spit mangled
cups, spill hot liquid on the countertop, make the wrong drink, and generally go
out of its way to make user experience a nightmare and to never ever produce
whatever it is the third party ordered.</p>

<p>Placed in an office where “making a coffee for someone else” is an accepted part
of the culture, the Machine will soon turn it into a nest of hate and
resentment. This is accelerated if the “someone else” is always the
boss. Unlucky interns and employees will cause mess after mess until they start
to truly hate the boss. The boss, in turn, will be frustrated that no one else
seems to be able to operate this “simple” machine that always works for them and
will come to hate their underlings in turn.</p>

<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h2>

<p>Despite its shitty interface, no roll is required to operate the Machine. It
does however read the operator’s mind to see if it should trigger the curse, in
which case it behaves as if a critical failure had been rolled. This will either
result in a humiliating mess, or in a normal-looking but undrinkable cup of
coffee that’s sure to cause inflict a nasty surprise on its intended recipient.</p>

<p>Someone who is wise to the curse can try to trick the device into operating
normally with a successful <strong>Mind Block</strong> roll, or through any powers they have
that can shield their thoughts from telepathy. This roll can me made at the
usual <strong>Will-5</strong> default if the character lacks the skill.</p>

<p>The machine’s infernal nature can be detected by any power or spell that detects
evil or infernal powers. It can be “cleansed” through <strong>Exorcism</strong> or equivalent
powers, like a more typical cursed artifact. Its greatest defense against
detection and exorcism is that neither of these abilities are common in the
settings in which it appears. Its true nature can’t be detected by purely
scientific means.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it-in-a-game">How to use it in a game</h2>

<p>The Coffee Machine From Hell is a perfect addition to any oppressive office your
PCs must infiltrate for a while, particularly if they’re undercover as
interns. It’s something of a trap in that case: If everyone else already hates
each others’ guts, the PCs will be the only ones who trigger the curse, and this
will draw undue attention to them.</p>

<p>Obviously, every office <em>in</em> Hell has one of these, but it can also be present
on Earthly companies under demonic influence, or just wind up in an otherwise
normal company without any explanation.</p>

<p>PCs on an infiltration mission will most likely need to trick the
machine. Exorcism attempts are too obvious and will likely blow their cover,
especially if they are actually infiltrating Hell. In an infiltration scenario
where the office is weird or evil in other ways, the machine is unlikely to be
the only obstacle they face.</p>

<p>In a campaign centered on paranormal investigation or monster hunting, the PCs
might be hired to find the problem behind a supernaturally toxic work
environment. If they have supernatural means of detecting evil, they’ll be able
to easily find the Machine, but in those cases it might be only one of the
sources of trouble. If they must rely only scientific instruments, then finding
the Machine is considerably harder even if they can easily use Exorcism to
cleanse it.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>As classic monsters, Ghouls had their 4e debut on the first Monster Manual, and
would end up making it into the Monster Vault as well. Here, the Monster Manual
3 gives us a few specialized ghoul variants that can compliment the ones on the
MV.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The basic lore for ghouls remains the same. You can check out a description of
it on my post about <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/20/ghoul.html">ghouls in the MM/MV</a>.</p>

<p>The MM3 emphasizes that ghouls are creatures of pure evil, since they used to be
individuals who practiced cannibalism or did other equally horrible things in
life. It adds that they are not only driven by a hunger for flesh, but are also
drawn to places where evil is powerful.</p>

<p>Ghouls will spontaneously show up at the home bases of evil cults, especially
those who worship Orcus or one of his exarchs. These villains often secure the
ghouls’ services by paying in live captives.</p>

<p>Ghouls will also seek out ruins and dungeons where great evil is entombed,
sometimes digging for miles to reach these places if they happen to be deep
underground. This attraction handily explains why the ghouls that live in these
places prefer to hang out there rather than terrorizing the countryside.</p>

<p>Some adventurers like to use these ghoul tunnels and warrens as a way to reach
their dungeons or the Underdark, but this is a risky proposition as any ghouls
living in the tunnels will have a terrain advantage against the interlopers.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>We get three different varieties of Ghoul here, none of which seem to be
reprinted in the MV. They’re all Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead
tag. They have Darkvision, Immunity to disease and poison, Resist 10 Necrotic,
and Vulnerable 5 Radiant.</p>

<h3 id="ghoul-flesh-seeker">Ghoul Flesh Seeker</h3>

<p>This is a cultist of Orcus who has undergone a voluntary transformation into a
ghoul. I guess the origin could be applied to any stat block, but this specific
entry describes a stealthy bastitch. They sometimes hunt in civilized
settlements, disguising themselves with heavy robes. When accompanying other
monsters, they like to strike from ambush while the PCs are busy with their less
stealthy buddies.</p>

<p>Flesh Seekers are Level 4 Lurkers with 45 HP. Their ground speed is an excellent
8, and their <strong>Shadow Skulk</strong> trait allows them to roll Stealth to hide in
combat when they have partial cover or concealment (normally you need full cover
or concealment).</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Claw</strong> that damages and immobilizes (save ends) on a
hit. They don’t have abilities to exploit this directly, but “standard” ghouls
do.</p>

<p>They have two “lurker”-y special attacks. The first is <strong>Prepare For
Sacrifice</strong>, which they can use against a creature from which they were hidden
at the start of their turn. It does more damage than the claw attack, and on a
hit the flesh seeker knocks the target prone and grabs it. The target can escape
using the normal rules (Athletics DC 14 or Acrobatics DC 16) but takes a -2
penalty on the escape test and can’t stand up until the grab ends.</p>

<p>The second special attack is <strong>Render Unto Orcus</strong>, and it can only be used on a
target grabbed by the flesh seeker. No special riders here, just a massive chunk
of damage.</p>

<p>Tactics write themselves: Ambush -&gt; Prepare For Sacrifice -&gt; Render Unto
Orcus. If someone pries you off your victim, hide and repeat.</p>

<h3 id="adept-of-orcus">Adept of Orcus</h3>

<p>A cannibal priest of Orcus who died and returned as a ghoul. This one retains
its memories, but since it already behaved like a ghoul in life the only way you
can tell it’s because it can use magic.</p>

<p>Adepts are Level 6 Controllers with the Leader tag and 71 HP. Their speed
is 8. They project an <strong>Uneasy Grave</strong> aura (5). Any non-minion ghoul ally that
dies inside this aura comes back as a zombie rotter (a minion) at the start of
its next turn.</p>

<p>The adept’s <strong>Claw</strong> damages and immobilizes, as typical for ghouls. It also has
three spells, all ranged attacks. <strong>Grave Grasp</strong> (at-will) does no damage and
restrains (save ends). <strong>Call to Feast</strong> (recharge 5+) immobilizes (save ends)
and allows a ghoul ally adjacent to the target to make a free basic attack
against them. And <strong>Grave Dust Cloud</strong> (encounter) is an area spell that does
necrotic damage and creates a zone that does 5 necrotic damage to any enemy who
enters it or ends their turn inside.</p>

<p>These things are extremely dangerous when paired with traditional ghouls, since
they can paralyze from a distance and allow their buddies to do huge damage
right away.</p>

<h3 id="ghast">Ghast</h3>

<p>Ghasts are a monster as traditional as the ghoul. Basically, they’re stronger
and stinkier ghouls. The MM and MV had Abyssal Ghouls to fill this role, but
they were level 16. This official Ghast entry is appropriate for mixing in with
standard ghouls.</p>

<p>Ghasts are what happens when a ghoul goes for too long without eating the flesh
of the living. Instead of starving, they rot from the inside and become even
more desperate and voracious. This rot is what gives them their horrible stench.</p>

<p>Ghasts are Level 6 Brutes with 85 HP. They’re a bit slower at speed 6, and their
<strong>Stench of Death</strong> aura (1) slows any living creatures that start their turns
inside.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> that damages and immobilizes for a turn. They
can use a <strong>Devouring Bite</strong> against an immobilized creature, which does huge
damage and keeps recharging until they hit with it. After the bite hits and is
spent, they can use their <strong>Rabid Claws</strong>, to make two melee attacks against
immobilized creatures. Each one does slightly less damage than the basic bite,
but if the two hit they hurt more overall.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These new ghoul types can fit into the same types of encounter group as the ones
from the MM/MV, which means they pair well with Orcus cultists and other
undead. And now you have enough ghoul stat blocks to make a large variety of
all-ghoul encounters.</p>

<p>As for my impressions… I like ghouls as opponents, and I would like to repeat
my warning from the original article to prefer the MV ghouls over the MM1
ones. The ones from this book pair well with the MV versions.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/08/03/merging-weapon-skills.html">Merging GURPS Weapon Skills</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Recently, Peter V. Dell’Orto made a post in his blog Dungeon Fantastic about
<a href="https://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com/2022/07/possible-weapon-skill-mergers-for-gurps.html">merging GURPS weapon skills</a>. I really, really like the idea, so I thought
about writing about how I’d do it.</p>

<p>Mr. Dell’Orto’s post is specific to Dungeon Fantasy and to his own Felltower
campaign. Mine is a bit more generic since I don’t have an active campaign
going, and I tend to kind of mix up Dungeon Fantasy and default GURPS rules in
my head. Consider it an addition to my <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/12/18/df-house-style.html">House Style</a>.</p>

<p>The reason for doing this is also pretty well-covered by this <a href="https://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com/2022/08/why-all-merging.html">follow-up Dungeon
Fantastic Post</a>: having too many fine distinctions between spells and skills
in a cinematic campaign can serve as a bit of a damper on the pacing and
excitement of the campaign. My usual players tend to have a certain resistance
to trying stuff that’s not on their character sheets, especially in a complex
system like GURPS, so having broader traits would allow them to experiment a bit
more.</p>

<h2 id="the-skills">The Skills</h2>

<p>In campaigns where this post is in effect, I’m going to use the following list
of weapon skills.</p>

<h3 id="axemace-dxaverage">Axe/Mace (DX/Average)</h3>

<p><em>Defaults: DX-5, Two-Handed Axe/Mace-3</em></p>

<p>This skill is a combination of the original <strong>Axe/Mace</strong> with <strong>Flail</strong>. When
using a flail, the character suffers a -1 skill penalty.</p>

<p>In games that use Techniques, <strong>Flail</strong> is a new Hard technique that defaults to
Skill-1 and has a maximum level equal to Skill. This means you can buy the -1
penalty off for 2 points.</p>

<h3 id="fencing-dxaverage">Fencing (DX/Average)</h3>

<p><em>Defaults: DX-5, One-Handed Sword-4</em></p>

<p>This new skill merges <strong>Rapier</strong>, <strong>Saber</strong> and <strong>Smallsword</strong>. It allows you to
use not only these three “titular” weapons, but also any other weapon that would
fall under those skills, such as the jian (Rapier) or the light stick
(Smallsword).</p>

<p>All the normal rules for fencing weapons apply.</p>

<h3 id="force-sword-dxaverage">Force Sword (DX/Average)</h3>

<p><em>Defaults: DX-5, Fencing-3, One-Handed Sword-3, Two-handed Sword-3</em>.</p>

<p>Should I ever play a science fiction game with force swords, this gets merged
with <strong>Force Saber</strong>. Whether you get fencing parries or not depends on the stat
line of the weapon you’re using. The “Fencing parries for everyone!” option is
also valid in a more explicitly Star Warsy game.</p>

<h3 id="knife-dxaverage">Knife (DX/Average)</h3>

<p><em>Defaults: DX-5, Fencing-4</em></p>

<p>This merges the original <strong>Knife</strong> skill with <strong>Jitte/Sai</strong> and
<strong>Main-Gauche</strong>. Any weapon that could be used with either of these can be used
with the new skill. Weapons use their Main-Gauche profiles for this, meaning
there’s no penalty for using the off hand and the user gets fencing parries.</p>

<p>In my experience, “knife expert” PCs always went for Main-Gauche anyway. People
who dropped a point in Knife as a back-up skill almost never ended up using it,
so they can just drop a point in this one instead.</p>

<p>The Jutte and the Sai get both a +2 for disarm attempts and fencing parries
without any special stance switches required. They are rare enough in my games
that I don’t believe it will be a problem. And by “rare” I mean no one has taken
these weapons and no one has tried a disarm yet.</p>

<h3 id="one-handed-sword-dxaverage">One-Handed Sword (DX/Average)</h3>

<p><em>Defaults: DX-5, Fencing-4, Two-Handed Sword-4</em></p>

<p>This is the skill used for all one-handed swords, merging both <strong>Broadsword</strong>
and <strong>Shortsword</strong>.</p>

<p>Blade length is an important consideration in real life, but it’s below the
level of granularity I prefer. This also broadens the range of really cool magic
swords your sword-wielding players can find and immediately use.</p>

<h3 id="pole-weapons-dxaverage">Pole Weapons (DX/Average)</h3>

<p><em>Defaults: DX-5, Two-Handed Sword-5</em></p>

<p>This merges <strong>Polearm</strong>, <strong>Spear</strong>, and <strong>Staff</strong>. The Form Mastery perk is
redundant for these weapons.</p>

<p>What about that sweet Staff parry bonus? If it’s in your weapon’s stat line
under Staff, you get it. If it’s not, you don’t. The only exception to this are
balanced two-handed spears, which I feel should have the bonus.</p>

<h3 id="two-handed-axemace-dxaverage">Two-Handed Axe/Mace (DX/Average)</h3>

<p><em>Defaults: DX-5, Axe-Mace-3</em></p>

<p>Like Axe/Mace, but for two-handed weapons. The same rules apply for two-handed
flails, including the existence of a Hard technique to buy the -1 penalty off.</p>

<h3 id="two-handed-sword-dxaverage">Two-Handed Sword (DX/Average)</h3>

<p><em>Defaults: DX-5, One-Handed Sword-4</em></p>

<p>This is pretty much the same skill as the original, with a suitably altered list
of defaults.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-all-the-other-skills">What about all the other skills?</h2>

<p>All of the more exotic weapon skills, like Whip, Kusari, and Tonfa, remain the
same. I might change my mind in the future and come back to this, but I haven’t
actually used any of them in my games, so it makes no difference for them to
stay as-is.</p>

<h2 id="optional-rule-weapon-familiarity">Optional Rule: Weapon Familiarity</h2>

<p>If you like how these skills are merged, but still feel a staff user shouldn’t
be able to pick up a halberd and wield it just as proficiently right away, then
you can use a version of the Familiarity rules from the GURPS core book.</p>

<p>PCs are considered familiar with any weapons they acquire during character
creation. If they pick up a weapon that would be used with a different skill
under the standard rules, they have a -2 penalty to use that weapon until they
can spend a few hours practicing with it. This takes time but costs no money or
points. In effect, it can only happen when the PCs have a significant amount of
downtime (such as when returning to town from a dungeon in DF). After this, the
PC is considered familiar with that weapon type.</p>

<p>I’m writing this up as an option, but it’s not one I’ll use myself.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Gargoyles made their 4e debut in the first Monster Manual. I wrote about them
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/12/gargoyle.html">here</a>. Though that article includes a whole bunch of gargoyles, most of them
are from the Monster Vault. When the MM3 was published, we still only had the
two originals from the MM1.</p>

<p>This entry adds a lot more variety, and it doesn’t actually overlap with the
later MV gargoyles, so we’re going to be looking at all of them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Gargoyle lore remains basically the same, and you can read it <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/12/gargoyle.html">here</a>. We get
two new bits in this entry:</p>

<p>The first is that efreets love to train packs of gargoyles to hunt sapients for
sport. The elemental lords are endlessly amused by their pets’ penchant for
sadism when hunting. In the world, cultists of the Elder Elemental Eye
frequently recruit and train gargoyles to guard their temples.</p>

<p>The second is that while gargoyles have a fearsome reputation in the world, they
tend to be viewed as weak in their native Elemental Chaos. There, they are more
often the prey than the hunter. Gargoyle packs skulk in caves and other secluded
locations, and only attack when they greatly outnumber their target.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>All gargoyles in this entry are Medium Elemental Humanoids with the Earth
keyword. They have Darkvision, a ground speed of 6, and a flight speed
of 8. They’re immune to petrification, and all but one of them have a passive
trait called <strong>Lurking Presence</strong>, which gives them a +10 bonus to Stealth
against enemies’ passive Perception.</p>

<p>It’s also interesting to note that none of the gargoyles in this entry have the
Lurker role - with these and the ones from the MV, you can build varied
all-gargoyle encounters.</p>

<h3 id="ironstone-gargoyle">Ironstone Gargoyle</h3>

<p>Identified by the rust-red streaks covering their bodies, Ironstone Gargoyles
behave like their “default” cousins, hanging out in mountain passes and ruins
waiting to raid unsuspecting passers-by. They wait in ambush but fight in a more
aggressive and mobile way than usual once combat starts.</p>

<p>Ironstone Gargoyles are Level 7 Skirmishers with 80 HP and the traits outlined
above. They use <strong>claws</strong> to fight, and have a special attack named <strong>Crashing
Stride</strong> (recharge 5+). This allows them to shift 4 squares and make claw
attacks against two targets at any point along the shift. If they hit, they also
slide the target 1 square and knock it prone.</p>

<p>When surrounded, a <strong>Leaping Glide</strong> (at-will move action) allows them to fly 4
squares without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>

<h3 id="hornstone-gargoyle">Hornstone Gargoyle</h3>

<p>This robust specimen is distinguished by its large horns, which it uses to gore,
impale and drag victims in combat. It’s a Level 8 Brute with 107 HP and all
standard traits.</p>

<p>Those horns can be used in an <strong>Impaling Charge</strong>, an attack which must be used
as part of a charge. It does heavy damage and grabs the target by impaling them
in the gargoyle’s horns. The target takes 5 ongoing damage while the grab
lasts. Escaping uses the standard rules (Athletics DC 22 or Acrobatics DC 19).</p>

<p>The gargoyle can use <strong>Skewering Drag</strong> as a move action to move half its speed
and automatically pull the grabbed victim along with it. Neither provokes
opportunity attacks from the other during this movement.</p>

<p>I left the basic <strong>Claw</strong> attack for last because it interacts with the above
abilities: aside from doing the usual heavy damage of a Brute, it allows the
monster to use Skewering Drag as a free action. Attacking the grabbed victim is
a perfectly valid choice, mind you.</p>

<p>In combat they’ll do their best to impale and drag an enemy away. If the charge
fails they prefer to fly away and try again rather than stand and fight with
basic attacks.</p>

<h3 id="obsidian-gargoyle">Obsidian Gargoyle</h3>

<p>Obsidian gargoyles are kinda brittle, but also covered in sharp edges. Massive
flocks of these things darken the skies of the Elemental Chaos, and they’re the
preferred variant of Elemental Eye cultists. They’re Level 8 Minion Soldiers.</p>

<p>Their <strong>claw</strong> attacks are nothing special, but they also have a <strong>Cruel Claws</strong>
passive that deals 4 damage to an enemy who leaves a square adjacent to the
gargoyle. That’s not a lot, but it triggers on a shift and <em>stacks</em>. Surround a
PC with these beasts. Leave only one way out. Dare them to take it.</p>

<h3 id="runic-gargoyle">Runic Gargoyle</h3>

<p>This is an <em>artificial</em> gargoyle variant, originally created to serve the Elder
Elemental Eye. Their skin looks like white marble covered in arcane runes, and
they are a lot smarter than your average gargoyle. Some of them have since
broken out of their servitude and found jobs with different groups.</p>

<p>Runic Gargoyles are Level 8 Soldiers with 87 HP and all standard traits <em>except</em>
for Lurking Presence, since they don’t really have natural camouflage. They were
made to be bodyguards, and their runes can be configured to bind them to a
designated “master”. I guess “client” might be a better word for free runic
gargoyles.</p>

<p>Their <strong>claw</strong> attack marks the target for a turn. They can also use an
<strong>Avenging Claws</strong> maneuver that dazes instead of marking. This recharges when
they’re first bloodied.</p>

<p>As a move action, they can teleport <strong>To the Master</strong>, appearing in a space
within 2 squares of the client. There is <em>no range limit</em> on this, and it allows
you to have a cool scene where the boss snaps his fingers and a gang of gargoyle
guards teleports in.</p>

<p>If the gargoyle is adjacent to its client and the client takes damage, it can
use <strong>Shielding Wings</strong> as an interrupt to take the damage instead.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>The same encounter building tips for MM1/MV gargoyles also apply here. The
efreet and Elder Eye angles are new and just as valid.</p>

<p>Inter-gargoyle synergy is highest between the gargoyles from this entry. You
have a couple of variants who are excellent at inflicting forced movement, and a
minion who deals damage to enemies who move away from it. And since all of them
fly, they also pair well with pits and other floor-based hazards.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The stat blocks in this entry don’t really change my general opinion of
gargoyles. They might be <em>too</em> iconic, as the exceptional case in a D&amp;D
adventure is meeting an inanimate gargoyle statue who <em>won’t</em> come to life and
try to kill you. For this reason, you don’t want to use them too much in your
actual game. Still, by combining the MM3 and the MV you have enough variants to
make that one gargoyle encounter truly memorable.</p>
