<p>Dark Ones appeared in the first 4e Monster Manual, and you can read my take on
that book’s entry <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/09/16/dark-one.html">here</a>. This entry adds a few more stat blocks and tries to
fill in the lore gaps.</p>

<p>If you read the post linked above, you’ll see that the MM1 contained little in
the way of Dark One Lore. I speculated that most of them would be peaceful
civilians like halflings are, but it seems that the Monster Manual 3 is moving
in the opposite direction by saying they’re <em>all</em> thieving murderers. I guess
this is a prelude for some of the even more egregious stuff you could find on
the Monster Vault and on some early 5e supplements.</p>

<p>This book says Dark Ones are “incapable” of crafting beautiful or useful
objects. This is described more like a divine curse than some sort of
neurological limitation. Everything they make is destined to be ugly, fragile,
and useless. Their armor crumples, their weapons shatter. So instead of making
their own stuff, they steal other people’s.</p>

<p>As the MM1 said, most Dark Ones live in the Shadowfell. This one says that they
tend to see the middle world as a, well, “loot pinãta”, full of stuff just
waiting to be taken. They tend to go for “loot caches” that are relatively
hidden from the larger societies of the middle world, and target groups that are
isolated from those same societies.</p>

<p>In other worlds, your typical team of Dark One acquisition experts is in direct
competition with adventuring parties for the XP and treasure contained in
dungeons, bandit lairs, and cultist strongholds. The PCs could arrive at one of
these places only to discover a group of Dark Ones got there first and took all
the stuff.</p>

<p>Some of them prefer to work as mercenaries instead of thieves, and they’ll join
forces with anyone who pays them. Often their clients end up being cults of
Vecna and other appreciators of the sneaky-stabby arts.</p>

<p>And of course, if you want to tone down the speciesism here, you can just remove
the divine curse bit. If you still want a Dark One community to be dependent on
goods from outside, you can say they rely on <em>trade</em> more than on theft and
mercenary work.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Most of the basic Dark One information remains identical to what it was on the
MM1. They’re Small Shadow Humanoids with Darkvision, a Speed of 6, and two
signature abilities.</p>

<p>The first is <strong>Dark Step</strong>, an at-will move action that lets them move 4 squares
with a +4 AC bonus against opportunity attacks, and gain combat advantage
against any enemies it ends up adjacent to.</p>

<p>The second is <strong>Killing Dark</strong>, which causes them to explode in a cloud of inky
darkness when reduced to 0 HP, blinding any enemies adjacent to them for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="hex-knight">Hex Knight</h3>

<p>Hex Knights are the closest thing Dark Ones have to noble warriors, though their
codes of conduct apply only to members of their own society. Their gear is very
similar to that of a common sneaky-stabby Dark One: leather or hide armor, short
sword, hand crossbow. Their fighting style, however is much more direct.</p>

<p>Hex Knights are Level 4 Soldiers with 54 HP. They mark enemies using the
<strong>Shadow Hex</strong> minor action, which lasts until the fight ends or the knight uses
it on someone else. Enemies who ignore the mark grant combat advantage to all
enemies for a turn.</p>

<p>The <strong>hand crossbow</strong> is a basic ranged attack and it’s merely okay. Knights are
better in melee, where their basic <strong>short sword</strong> can attack twice with one
action, and each hit slows the target. Knights can also use their swords in a
<strong>Vicious Flurry</strong> (recharge 5+), which targets 1 or 2 enemies with a sword
attack that also does ongoing damage.</p>

<h3 id="shadow-bolters">Shadow Bolters</h3>

<p>These spellcasters are usually on some secret mission to acquire a treasure or a
valuable bit of information, and will prioritize that mission over whatever else
might be going on. They might pose as mercenaries or allies to some other
faction as a cover. Once they have what they seek, they’ll abscond, leaving
enemies and allies alike behind.</p>

<p>Bolters are Level 5 Artillery with 50 HP. They fight with <strong>daggers</strong> in melee
and with <strong>black bolt</strong> spells at range, and they’re all about gaining combat
advantage. The <strong>Deadly Precision</strong> trait gives them combat advantage against
any enemy flanked by two allies, even if the bolter themselves are far
away. When they hit someone with combat advantage, they deal 5 extra necrotic
damage to the target and to any of the target’s allies adjacent to it.</p>

<p>The black bolts also make a hit target take 5 necrotic damage whenever they
provoke an opportunity attack (save ends), which is very situational but might
be useful to punish mobile PCs.</p>

<h3 id="shadow-speakers">Shadow Speakers</h3>

<p>Shadow Speakers are the Dark Ones that know the necessary rituals for crossing
between the middle world and the Shadowfell. They lead “acquisition” expeditions
into the middle world, and are responsible for bringing them back home. They
carry little clay jugs filled with soil from the Shadowfell as a focus for their
powers.</p>

<p>Shadow speakers are Level 6 Controllers with 70 HP. They fight with <strong>short
swords</strong> and shadow magic.</p>

<p>Their basic ranged attack is a <strong>Shadow Curse</strong> that deals necrotic damage,
makes the target grant combat advantage, and inflicts 5 necrotic damage when the
target provokes an opportunity attack (save ends both).</p>

<p>Less often, they can cast a <strong>Choking Shadow</strong> spell (recharge 5+), which deals
heavy necrotic damage and immobilizes for a turn.</p>

<p>Even one of these is an excellent force multiplier for a Dark One party, or
really for any encounter group whose members deal extra damage with combat
advantage. Just have then stay at the range limit for Shadow Curse and spam it
on the PCs to make them all grant combat advantage.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Shadow Speakers tend to be “load-bearing monsters” for Dark
One encounter groups, since they’re the group’s only way home. If the Shadow
Speaker is in too much danger, the entire group might try to make a run for it.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like the greater encounter variety, but I dislike the extra emphasis on a
species-wide negative stereotype (“they’re all thieves, every last one of
them”). I’ll stick to my initial assumptions that these stat blocks represent
the Dark One equivalent of adventurers and other combatants rather than typical
members of the culture.</p>

<p>I think crauds are a new monster. At the very least they’re one I haven’t met
before.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Crauds are giant crawdads! These crustaceans are about the same height as a
halfling, but bulkier. They tend to show up in large numbers in maritime and
coastal areas that have suffered extensive environmental damage such as from
pollution or overfishing.</p>

<p>In these circumstances they’re very aggressive and voracious man-eaters, raiding
ships and villages with terrifying frequency. If a craud “army” shows up at your
village or town, they’ll keep showing up every few days until either all of them
or all of you are dead.</p>

<p>This causes some scholars to speculate that crauds are the vengeance of Melora
made manifest and sent against those who despoil her coasts. Others defend the
more mundane explanation that crauds attack sapients because their usual food
sources have been driven to extiction by the environmental damage. In a world
where the goddess of nature is real, though, is there any difference?</p>

<p>I guess non-distressed crauds normally stay mostly underwater and feed on fish
and such. They’re non-sapient but have good teamwork instincts and a somewhat
“hive-like” social organization where certain individuals known as Kings can
direct other crauds via patterns of flashing colors and lights in their
carapaces.</p>

<p>Sometimes an unscrupulous sea-borne villain like a pirate captain will manage to
catch a craud king, torturing it in specific ways to direct its “subjects” to
attack interesting targets. Coastal druids and clerics of Melora know gentler
ways to secure the cooperation of these crustaceans.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Crauds are Medium Natural Beasts with the Aquatic keyword. They have darkvision,
and move at speed 6 on land or in water. The effects of the Aquatic keyword
haven’t changed, but in this book they’re written down on all the stat blocks as
a trait: aquatic creatures can breathe underwater, and when fighting underwater
gain a +2 attack bonus against non-aquatic opponents.</p>

<h3 id="craud-impaler">Craud Impaler</h3>

<p>Impalers are lithe and quick on their feet, usually arriving at the head of a
craud “army”. Their job is to tie up the opposition until their stronger cousins
can arrive. They’re cautious, and become more so after being bloodied,
preferring to focus on already weakened opponents.</p>

<p>Impalers are Level 3 Skirmishers with 51 HP. They fight using <strong>claws</strong> and some
sort of pointy appendage that allows them to make an <strong>Impale</strong> attack. It has
Reach 2, deals light physical damage, and inflicts ongoing 5 damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Impale is an encounter power, and the claws are a bit underpowered too. But the
<strong>Scissor Claws</strong> at-will ability allows the impaler to make two claw attacks,
and if both hit the creature immediately recharges Impale and uses it as a free
action. That’s a lot of damage if everything hits.</p>

<p>And when the impaler misses with an attack, <strong>Scuttle</strong> allows it to shift 2
squares as a free action. So if that any component of that claw/claw/impale
combo fails to hit, the beast can try to get away safely.</p>

<h3 id="craud-crusher">Craud Crusher</h3>

<p>These are the “stronger cousins” the impalers are waiting for. Their claws are
so huge they can crush a human torso, or bludgeon that human with enough force
to send them flying. When they arrive, they engage the impalers’ opponents and
free the impalers up to scuttle around and be skirmishers.</p>

<p>Crushers are Level 4 Brutes with 70 HP. Their <strong>claws</strong> do surprisingly little
basic damage, but a hit with them also grabs the target. Crushers can grab one
victim at a time, and can inflict automatic damage to them with a minor
action. Once per encounter they can also use <strong>Hammerclaw</strong> to backhand a fool,
dealing heavy damage, pushing 1 square, and knocking them prone.</p>

<p>If the crusher reduces anyone to 0 HP by any means, <strong>Red Tide</strong> gives them a +5
bonus to their next damage roll. This is an incentive for them to target enemies
previously softened by impalers.</p>

<h3 id="craud-king">Craud King</h3>

<p>Craud Kings are imposing specimens whose shells are covered in bio-luminescent
organs. Signals from these organs direct other crauds and boost their morale in
a fight. There might be some magic involved here, as some of their light
patterns have an effect on humanoids too. The creature is also a pretty good
fighter itself, so its ideal location is at the forefront of the melee
surrounded by loyal subjects. The best way to influence a craud force is to
influence its king, as discussed in the Lore section.</p>

<p>Kings are Level 5 Soldiers with the Leader tag and 67 HP. Their lights project
an aura (3) named <strong>Blood in the Water</strong>, giving allies a +2 bonus to attack
bloodied targets.</p>

<p>Their <strong>claws</strong> do good damage and slide the target 1 square. <strong>Claw Flurry</strong>
(recharge 5+) allows them to attack twice, and if a slid enemy ends up adjacent
to one of the king’s allies, the ally gets to make a free attack too.</p>

<p>By changing the pattern of its lights, the King can use the <strong>Angler’s Lure</strong>
ability as a minor action. This is a charm attack that does no damage, pulls
the victim 3 squares, and marks it for a turn.</p>

<p>Finally, when the king is bloodied it prompts all of its allies to act <strong>For The
King</strong>. All allies within 5 squares of the wounded sovereign immediately shifts
4 squares closer to the king and make free attacks against any enemy they end up
next to.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>If this had been a 3e-style entry, I’d probably have glossed over it
entirely. Giant crawdads, yawn. The varied stat blocks to make them more
interesting, as does the “nature’s vengeance” aspect of their lore. That’s a
handy adventure hook built right into the monster entry.</p>

<p>I’m sure you could complete the lineup seen here with custom-made artillery
crauds that fire high-pressure water jets. Or maybe you could use the
“controlled by pirates” angle to pair them up with pirate musketeers.</p>

<p>Cloakers are an old D&amp;D standby, originating back in the days of AD&amp;D 1st
Edition where they belonged to a category of monsters that looked like
furniture.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The lore introduction for cloakers in this book actually references their
“gygaxian gotcha” origins! It tells the story of a thief who had the bad habit
of looting the room while his buddies were still fighting the monsters, and who
died when the “fine leather cloak” he found in Tsojcanth turned out to be a
cloaker.</p>

<p>Aside from that easter egg, though, the “disguised cloak” thing is
gone. Cloakers are still sneaky, but they prever to fly silently and swoop on
from above. They’re sapient but profoundly anti-social, and their preferred
“team-up” method is to follow group of other monsters unnoticed, from a safe
distance. When those other monsters find tasty prey, the cloaker swoops in to
grab some of it.</p>

<p>Cloakers tend to avoid each other except in rare “conclaves”, where a whole
bunch of them huddle up in a big sphere and exchange news and gossip. Outside of
that you’ll only find cloakers cooperating if their lives are in imminent risk.</p>

<p>Whether hunting or defending themselves, cloakers fight by slapping with their
barbed tails and by enveloping victims with their flexible wings that can choke
and crush someone to death. They also emit a strange moaning sound that causes
unnatural fear in those who hear it.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Cloakers are Large Aberrant Magical Beasts with Darkvision. Their ground speed
is a pitiful 2 (clumsy), but their flight speed is 8. Despite being aberrant
there’s nothing in their lore linking them to the Far Realm. If you wanted, you
could make them Natural or give them another any other origin without changing
anything about their stats.</p>

<h3 id="cloaker-ambusher">Cloaker Ambusher</h3>

<p>These are your common specimens. They’re Level 12 Lurkers with 95 HP. Those
<strong>Unnerving Moans</strong> count as an aura (2) with the Fear keyword, inflicting a -2
attack penalty on non-deafened enemies caught inside.</p>

<p>The afore-mentioned <strong>Tail Slap</strong> is a basic attack doing standard physical
damage, but the <strong>Envelop</strong> ability gets lots of text. It’s an attack that
targets Reflex and does no immediate damage. On a hit the target is grabbed,
pulled to the cloaker’s space, and becomes blinded, dazed, restrained and takes
10 ongoing damage. While enveloping a victim, any attacks that hit the cloaker
do half damage to the monster and half to the victim.</p>

<p>Since this is a grab, escaping requires an Athletic test against the cloaker’s
Fortitude (24) or Acrobatics against its Reflex (23). I guess explicit escape
DCs are a Monster Vault innovation.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the cloaker ambusher can use <strong>Shadow Shift</strong> to gain
concealment for a turn. If it was already concealed by the environment, it gains
total concealment instead.</p>

<h3 id="cloaker-lord">Cloaker Lord</h3>

<p>This is a cloaker that managed to live to a more advanced age than most of its
peers, and has mastered the natural magic that powers its moan. It’s a Level 18
Controller with 172 HP and all the same abilities as a basic cloaker plus a few
more moaning-related ones.</p>

<p>The first one is <strong>Terrifying Moan</strong> (recharge 4+), a Close Burst 2 targetting
Will. It does psychic damage and forces the target to move its speed away from
the monster. This isn’t a push, it’s a move, so the victim could trigger
opportunity attacks from other monsters during it.</p>

<p>The second one is <strong>Hypnotic Moan</strong>. It affects the same area but instead of
doing damage it stuns for a turn on a hit and dazes for a turn on a
miss. Thankfully it’s an encounter power, so this will only happen once.</p>

<p>Both the cloaker’s Unnerving Moan aura and the area covered by its attacks
increase from 2 to 5 when the creature is bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The Envelop ability is kinda frightening, but I guess my impression of cloakers
remains the same it’s always been: meh.</p>

<p>Chitines feel like a late-3e addition to the game, and likely had slightly
different lore back then.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Chitines are an artificially engineered people. The first of their kind were
produced in drow laboratories in an attempt to create the perfect slaves. The
techniques and materials used were a mixture of arcane magic, prayers to Lolth
and both souls and genetic material from elves, spiders, and demons.</p>

<p>It did not work out. Soon after the first batch of chitines was created, <em>Lolth
herself</em> intervened to grant them freedom and allow them to strike back at their
would-be enslavers. This makes a lot more sense once you remember Lolth doesn’t
really like or trust her worshippers, as we discussed in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/06/24/demons-04.html">Yochlol</a> entry.</p>

<p>Lolth’s intervention caused a special priestly caste of chitines, known as
Choldriths, to emerge from the vats and lead their people to freedom. In our
narrative present, chitines inhabit the upper Underdark and believe themselves
to be the true chosen of Lolth. The relationship between their two peoples can
be summed up as “kill on sight”, though chitines are more willing to negotiate
with non-drow peoples and trade their service as mercenaries in exchange for
money, weapons and magic.</p>

<p>Most chitines are devout Lolth worshippers to the same extent drow are, though
each people considers the other’s faith heretical. Chitines believe they, and
not the drow, are Lolth’s favorites, and that her true form is that of a spider
rather than that of a drow.</p>

<p>The creation of the chitines is a relatively recent event, so they lack much
experience with surface. They know it exists, but haven’t really explored it and
tend to see it as a source of baffling mysteries. The book mentions a story
about a shifter illusionist that managed to convince a chitine settlement that
she was an aspect of Lolth, and used them to attack a nearby drow settlement and
assassinate a rival.</p>

<p>There’s an interesting side box here about how chitines build their lairs. The
basic structure here is a <strong>suspended fortress</strong>, a tear-shaped web sack hanging
from the ceiling that’s large enough to contain two or three floors of
chambers. Larger settlements have several of these linked by walkways. You can
use this style to build chitine-themed dungeons.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Chitines are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Spider keyword. They have
Darkvision, and a Spider Climb speed equal to their ground speed (usually
6). Most of them prefer daggers for combat, with specialists using other
weapons.</p>

<p>Their signature power is a <strong>Web Line</strong> (move action, encounter), which can be
used when they’re climbing and allows them to fly 5 squares. Everything else
comes from training.</p>

<h3 id="chitine-grunt">Chitine Grunt</h3>

<p>Chitines don’t really have the concept of a “non-combatant”. When their lairs
are attacked, every individual inside grabs a knife or four and rushes to its
defense. The vast majority of them are going to use this stat block.</p>

<p>Grunts are Level 5 Minion Brutes. They wield four <strong>daggers</strong> which can be used
for melee or ranged basic attacks. When killed they emit a <strong>Dying Shriek</strong> that
inflicts a -2 penalty to the defenses of all adjacent enemies for a turn. This
is an untyped penalty, so I <em>think</em> it might stack. I’m not sure, though.</p>

<h3 id="chitine-warrior">Chitine Warrior</h3>

<p>These chitines have a combination of extra training and experience that makes
them a much greater threat in combat. They’re Level 5 Brutes with 72 HP. They
carry eight daggers, four in hand and four ready to replace any thrown
blades. Like their minion counterparts, they can use <strong>daggers</strong> for melee and
ranged basic attacks, and they can also make a <strong>Four Blade Strike</strong> that
consists of four slightly weaker dagger attacks.</p>

<p>They’re pretty much a non-minion version of the Grunt, and they never step on
the actual floor of the map unless they can’t help it, attacking instead from
the ceiling and walls.</p>

<h3 id="chitine-scounts">Chitine Scounts</h3>

<p>Scouts patrol and defend the approaches to a chitine cave, using rapid-firing
hand crossbows to attack from unexpected angles. They’re Level 5 Artillery with
48 HP.</p>

<p>Their melee basic attack is still a <strong>dagger</strong>, but those <strong>hand crossbows</strong>
have a lot more range than a thrown knife. Using the <strong>Furious Volley</strong> ability,
they can make up to two dagger and two crossbow attacks with a single
action. Once per encounter they can fire a <strong>Poisoned Bolt</strong> that targets
Fortitude, does the same damage as a regular attack and inflicts 10 ongoing
poison damage. That’s a lot for level 5!</p>

<h3 id="chitine-marauders">Chitine Marauders</h3>

<p>Chitine custom says that any offspring beyond the first eight in a clutch must
be cast out to fend for themselves in the Underdark. If these outcasts manage to
survive a year out there, they’re welcomed back. Most who survive don’t bother
trying to return, and instead form their own outcast communities. They set up
ambush spots by building camouflaged web doors over niches in narrow tunnels,
from which they emerge to surround victims.</p>

<p>Marauders are Level 6 Skirmishers with 72 HP. They’re armed with paired <strong>short
swords</strong>, and the <strong>Quick Jabs</strong> ability allows them to make two attacks per
action with them, shifting 2 squares after each one. They deal extra damage if
they have combat advantage.</p>

<p>The same stat block can of course be used for non-marauder chitine skirmishers
if you need some.</p>

<h3 id="chitine-web-crafter">Chitine Web Crafter</h3>

<p>Web crafters are those chitines specialized in producing webs and building stuff
with them. They’re responsible for architecting and building those suspended
fortresses, as well as the traps and mechanisms that go into them. The web
crafter’s guild is usually the second most influential organization in a chitine
society - if you anger them, your home might come crashing down with you
inside.</p>

<p>The choldrith priests are the only group above them, and one way they keep the
web crafters in check is to demand they participate in combat. Chitine patrols
or raiding parties probably include a web crafter or two, who might act as the
officer in charge. If the crafters had time to prepare before the fight, the
battle map certain to include web-based hazards and traps.</p>

<p>Web crafters are Level 6 Controllers with 72 HP. They fight in melee with
lightly-poisoned <strong>speads</strong> that do physical damage and slow for a turn. They
can throw <strong>poisoned web orbs</strong> that do poison damage and also slow for a turn,
or <strong>web balls</strong> (recharge 4+) that do physical damage and restrain (save ends).</p>

<p>They can also create a <strong>Web Wall</strong> once per encounter. The wall is 6 squares
long and counts as destructible blocking terrain. Each square as the same
defenses as the crafter and 10 HP. They’re vulnerable to fire, but attacking
them in melee causes immobilization (save ends) as the webs stick to the PC.</p>

<p>Clever crafters might use walls to separate defenders from squishies, and then
bombard the squishies with poison and the defenders with web balls while their
melee buddies move freely between the two groups.</p>

<h3 id="choldrith">Choldrith</h3>

<p>Choldriths are the special priestly caste created by Lolth’s intervention in the
original chitine production process. They’re visibly different from common
chitines, resembling pale driders. They’re invariably at the top of chitine
social hierarchies, and their flocks are so devoted to them that there are
stories of chitines who collapsed their whole colonies while resisting a
troglodyte raid, killing themselves so their choldrith leaders might survive.</p>

<p>Choldriths are Large Natural Humanoids with the Spider keyword, and Level 8
Controllers (Leaders) with 90 HP. In combat they use a mix of natural weapons
and Lolth-themed magic.</p>

<p>Their basic melee attack is a <strong>Claw</strong> that does poison damage and immobilizes
for a turn. Their basic ranged attack is a <strong>Web</strong> that does physical damage and
restrains for a turn. They can also use a <strong>Shadow Spider Curse</strong> that deals
poison damage and makes the target grant combat advantage to spiders (save
ends). “Spiders” here means anything with the Spider keyword: actual spiders,
chitines, driders, ettercaps…</p>

<p>Once per encounter choldriths can summon a cloud of <strong>Choking Vapors</strong>, which
deal immediate and ongoing poison damage over an area. They remain as a zone
that deals 5 poison damage to anyone who enters or ends their turn there.</p>

<p>The choldriths “leaderly” skills are both triggered actions. <strong>Spider Queen’s
Enforcer</strong> is an interrupt that triggers when an ally within 5 squares misses an
attack. It deals 5 damage to the ally and makes them reroll the attack. <strong>For
the Spider Queen</strong> is an interrupt that triggers when the choldrith is hit with
a melee or ranged attack, and redirects the damage to an adjacent ally.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think I actually remember seeing that chitine illustration in a book for a
previous edition, and pretty much glancing right past the entry. The 4e strategy
of including several variant stat blocks for each monster certainly paid off
here. With this entry plus a few spiders from the other books you have enough
monsters for a whole themed dungeon, covering all roles.</p>

<p>Still, I can understand why they waited until the MM3 to do a chitine
writeup. They have a lot of thematic overlap with drow, and there would be
little reason to include both in a campaign that wasn’t entirely about Lolth. In
such a campaign they would make good heroic tier opponents for GMs who dislike
manually adjusting monster levels, since drow are by default paragon tier.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>I believe Cave Fishers originated in AD&amp;D, one of the many examples of “cave
ceiling fauna” in that edition. Your group might be on the lookout for
darkmantles, spiders and piercers, but they’ll never see the cave fisher
coming. This is their 4e debut.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Cave fishers are nonsapient predatory arthropods about the size of an adult
human. They’re entirely natural and mundane, by the standards of D&amp;D. They hunt
by hiding in cave ceilings, and pulling prey from the ground using either sticky
strands or spear-like appendages.</p>

<p>As the name implies, cave fishers hang out underground. They prefer caves with
high ceilings and plenty of ledges, where they make their nests. They organize
themselves in loose collectives, and newly-mated pairs fly out to look for an
empty ledge to nest in.</p>

<p>The two varieties of cave fisher presented here aren’t different species,
they’re different sexes: anglers are female, and spikers are male. Anglers lay
eggs and watch the nest, hunting only when prey wanders nearby. Spikers range
farther out to look for food.</p>

<p>Cave fishers can’t usually be tamed, but people tend to use meat-based bait to
lure them to caves they want protected and to distract them when passing through
those caves. Hobgoblins sometimes capture fisher eggs and train them from
hatching to serve as living artillery.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Adult cave fishers are Medium Natural Beasts. Spawn old enough to be a threat
are Small. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 6 and a climb speed of 5 with
Spider Climb (5 and 4 for the spawn).</p>

<h3 id="cave-fisher-spawn">Cave Fisher Spawn</h3>

<p>Fisher spawn lead a stressful existence from very early on. A weak individual is
likely to be devoured by its siblings if they get hungry enough.</p>

<p>These Small spawn are Level 2 Minion Brutes. They attack with their <strong>pincers</strong>
and do extra damage against immobilized, restrained, or helpless targets.</p>

<h3 id="cave-fisher-angler">Cave Fisher Angler</h3>

<p>This adult female tends to stick close to the nest, and rely on its ledge for
concealment. To hunt, she lowers a sticky filament to just above head height of
the passing prey, and snaps it around the prey’s neck when they pass
underneath.</p>

<p>Anglers are Level 3 Lurkers with 37 HP. They have the <strong>Sniper</strong> trait, which
ensures they stay hidden if they make a ranged attack from concealment and miss.</p>

<p>This is useful because their <strong>Filament Strangle</strong> counts as a ranged attack! It
has range 5, targets Reflex, and though its initial damage is weak it pulls the
target 3 squares and restrains them (save ends). The pull can be vertical, and
the target can end that movement suspended in midair. This effect can be
sustained with standard actions in subsequent rounds, dealing automatic damage
to the target and pulling them again.</p>

<p>Aside from passing the save, there are few options from escaping the
filament. The victim can teleport or be teleported, which frees them
automatically; or one of their allies can target the filament with an
attack. The filament has the same defenses as the angler, and hitting it frees
the victim but deals no damage to the beast itself.</p>

<p>If an angler does get into melee range of a PC, it can also use its basic
<strong>pincer</strong> attack, which does average damage and has no special effects.</p>

<p>It’s likely that the PCs will only realize an angler is hunting them when the
first victim gets grabbed by a filament. And once that happens it can stay in
full cover atop that ceiling ledge until it has to peek out to try and grab
someone else!</p>

<h3 id="cave-fisher-spiker">Cave Fisher Spiker</h3>

<p>Spikers are the males of the species. Instead of producing a single strand of
filament, they can spit small tangles of it at greater ranges. These either
harden into spikes, or envelop a victim and begin contracting. The creature uses
these techniques to kill its prey and drag the carcass back to its nest.</p>

<p>Spikers are Level 3 Artillery with 37 HP. They have the same Sniper trait as the
angler, and a <strong>Camouflage</strong> trait that gives them +2 to defenses against ranged
and area attacks.</p>

<p>Their basic attacks are a <strong>pincer</strong> in melee, and a <strong>filament spike</strong> at
range. Those contracting filaments are represented by the <strong>Filament Wrap</strong>
attack (recharge 5+), which does no immediate damage but immobilizes the target
and inflicts 5 ongoing damage (save ends both).</p>

<p>Spikers tend to focus their fire on a single victim, since their instinct is to
kill it quickly and make off with the body.</p>

<h3 id="cave-fisher-line-spiker">Cave Fisher Line Spiker</h3>

<p>Hobgoblins that manage to capture a batch of cave fisher eggs like to use a
combination of magic and their ancient beast-taming techniques to turn them into
weapons of war. This results in a specimen that’s less robust than a wild
spiker, but which can follow commands and fire in formation to support the
troops.</p>

<p>Like Spikers are Level 4 Minion Artillery. They have the usual <strong>pincer</strong> melee
attack, and their basic ranged attack is a <strong>slowing spike</strong> that does a bit of
damage and slows for a turn. Once per encounter they can use a <strong>Toppling
Spike</strong> that deals a bit more damage and knocks prone. Since they’re minions,
this should be their first attack. Line spikers want to stay far away from the
front lines and will likely run away rather than engage the PCs in melee.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These cave fishers have enough unique mechanics to distinguish themselves from
other “ceiling fauna”. Their low level makes it likely they’ll be the first such
fauna the PCs meet. They can also inhabit the Underdark, but you might want to
boost their levels if you want to place them there.</p>

<p>Since they’re regulars, your PCs shouldn’t run into lone fishers, at least not
as a full combat encounter. You can make an “all-wildlife” encounter with 2-3
mated pairs at once, or with 1 mated pair and other opportunistic underground
predators. Line spikers, of course, will always be accompanied by squads of
goblinoids including at least one beast tamer.</p>
