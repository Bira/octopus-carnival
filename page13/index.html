<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Jellies, slimes, molds, puddings. Collectively known as “oozes”, these are
likely the most iconic D&amp;D monsters not exempted from the OGL. Talk about
dragons all you want, but I’ll bet you far more adventuring parties have faced
(and died to) some kind of ooze than they did dragons. They’ve been in the game
since the beginning, and their variety has only increased as time went on. Here
they’re present in both books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Talking about “oozes” is like talking about “animals”. There’s so many types
that you can’t really describe them as a whole in anything but the most general
terms. They’re goopy, they’re mindless, they like damp and/or dark places, and
they eat just about any type of organic matter by dissolving it with their
acidic secretions.</p>

<p>As far as the inhabitants of 4e’s implied setting are concerned, oozes are just
a fact of life, like animals or plants. They’re natural creatures that have been
around forever and everyone knows they exist. Learning how to keep your basement
or root cellar ooze-free is probably a basic life skill.</p>

<p>The most sensible advice for any regular person who spots an ooze is to turn
around and leave. This is complicated by the fact that sometimes these creatures
wait in ambush. Also, adventurers are neither regular nor sensible, and they
like to delve into exactly the sort of place oozes thrive in, so they end up
running into these creatures much more often than civilians.</p>

<p>Oozes are drawn to heat and movement, so they often try to eat living creatures,
but they don’t have a preference for them over any other organic matter and can
subsist on dungeon crud just as well. Finding an unusually clean room or
corridor is a sure sign that you’re approaching an ooze lair.</p>

<p>In addition to the no doubt large variety of natural species, these things are
also quite likely to form as the result of botched magical experiments, or to
spontaneously form in piles of magical waste. They’re even easy to <em>summon</em>, so
your PCs might end up fighting them when they go up against the sort of wizard
who’s into that.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Oozes are Natural Beasts of varying size, with the Blind and Ooze keywords. They
always have some sort of blindsight or tremorsense they use to perceive their
surroundings.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault adds an <strong>Ooze</strong> trait that all of its versions have, which
allows them to ignore all penalties for squeezing. Normally, while a character
squeezes past an opening smaller than themselves, they move at half speed, grant
combat advantage, and attack at a -5 penalty. Oozes ignore all of that. I think
the Ooze keyword implies the same rules for the MM oozes, it’s just less
explicit.</p>

<h3 id="ochre-jelly-both">Ochre Jelly (Both)</h3>

<p>This Large ooze is a Level 3 Elite Brute with 102 HP and 5 acid resistance. It
crawls at speed 4, and the MV also gives it a climb speed of 4.</p>

<p>Both versions attack with pseudopod <strong>Slams</strong> that do physical damage and
ongoing acid damage (save ends). As a move action they can use <strong>Flowing Form</strong>
to shift their speed, which means they pretty much never make normal moves. I
think their Ooze trait also means they can squeeze between adventurers if the
party surrounds them but leaves a small gap.</p>

<p>When first bloodied, an ochre jelly <strong>Splits</strong> into two jellies with half the
original’s HP. So a jelly that hits exactly 51 HP would split into 25 and 26 HP
halves. Both of these individuals act independently, and the new one doesn’t
have any of the conditions that applied to the original.</p>

<p>If the fight ends with the two jellies alive (e.g., if the PCs ran away or
died), they eventually recombine.</p>

<p>A pair of ochre jellies makes a nice mini-boss fight for level 1 adventurers!
And you could easily make higher level versions that start out Huge and split
more often to challenge more powerful parties.</p>

<h3 id="green-slime-mv">Green Slime (MV)</h3>

<p>Green Slimes split the difference between a monster and a hazard, with different
editions treating them in different ways. Here, they’re monsters.</p>

<p>These green, runny slimes are Medium Level 4 Lurkers with 47 HP. They have 5
acid resistance and 5 vulnerability to both fire and radiant damage. Their basic
<strong>slams</strong> target Reflex and do 5 immediate and 5 ongoing acid damage (save
ends), which is notable because it’s a flat amount and not a damage roll.</p>

<p>They also have a special <strong>Engulf</strong> attack that also targets Reflex, does a bit
of immediate acid damage, and initiates a grab with escape DC 18. This is the 4e
version of the classic “a green slime drops on you from the ceiling” attack, so
it will likely be made with combat advantage due to surprise. Until the target
escapes the grab, they take 10 ongoing acid damage (a lot at heroic tier), and
any attacks against the slime deal half damage to the monster and half to the
victim.</p>

<p>This is not quite as bad as the “you’re dead in 1d4 rounds” of the old-school
version, but if an unlucky level 1 adventurer runs into one of these the result
will be pretty much the same.</p>

<h3 id="gelatinous-cube-both">Gelatinous Cube (Both)</h3>

<p>Ridiculous, or ridiculously awesome? These Large translucent oozes are shaped
like 10-foot cubes, fitting precisely in any Gygax-standard dungeon
corridor. They’re Level 5 Elite Brutes with 156 HP, who crawl along at a ground
or climb speed of 3.</p>

<p>In addition to the Ooze trait, they are <strong>Translucent</strong>, which makes them
invisible until they’re spotted (a DC 25 Perception check!) or until they
attack. I think it’s still true that they can’t digest metal or bone, so even if
you fail to spot the cube you might still see a floating pile of coins, a
skeleton, or a suit of armor. That’s not exactly a disadvantage: watch as the
impetuous barbarian or paladin charges the foul “construct” or “undead” and
walks right into the cube!</p>

<p>If you fail to spot the cube and walk (or charge!) into it, you’re automatically
hit by its <strong>Engulf</strong> attack and sucked into its corrosive and anesthetic
insides. This is a grab, and a grabbed victim is dazed and takes 10 ongoing acid
damage until they escape (DC 15 in the MV, 16-18 in the MM).</p>

<p>Gelatinous cubes can also be more proactive in chasing their meals! Once the
fight is joined, it will attack with <strong>Slams</strong> (Melee 1 vs. Fortitude) that deal
acid damage and immobilize (save ends), and make active Engulf attempts (Melee 1
vs. Reflex).</p>

<p>Gelatinous cubes are still exactly as much fun as they were in older
editions. Aside from the corridor, “pile of treasure” or “skeleton” setups, you
can also put them at the bottom of pit traps and the like.</p>

<h3 id="black-pudding-mv">Black Pudding (MV)</h3>

<p>The top of the food chain when it comes to classic oozes. This is a Large, Level
8 Elite Brute with 218 HP and 15 acid resistance. Their ground speed is 4, their
climb speed 3.</p>

<p>Black puddings are super-aggressive. The pudding’s <strong>Slams</strong> do quite a bit of
acid damage, and the thing can shift up to its speed before or after the
attack. They’re more like lunges than slams.</p>

<p>The pudding can also <strong>engulf</strong> (close blast 3 vs. Fortitude), which does the
same damage as a slam to everyone in the area and grabs them (DC 16). The
pudding can them use a standard action to <strong>melt</strong> one of its grabbed victims,
dealing a nice chunk of automatic acid damage and eating a healing surge. If the
victim has no healing surges left, they take 10 extra acid damage instead.</p>

<p>Defense-wise, black puddings are less of a puzzle monster than they used to be,
but they still retain some of that in their <strong>Split</strong> trait. When they’re hit by
a weapon attack, a piece of them splits off and becomes a Black Pudding Spawn in
an adjacent square.</p>

<p>Spawn are Medium Level 8 Minion Brutes whose slams have the same “shift your
speed” rider as their parent’s and do minion-level acid damage. There is <em>no
limit</em> to how many spawns may be in play at any given time, so the party is
going to be in for a nasty surprise if they have a Twin Strike ranger or are
all-martial.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Being dumber than even mundane insects, oozes don’t “ally” with anyone. Still,
some creatures might keep them in a convenient corner of their lair to deter
intruders, or they might join an ongoing fight as opportunistic predators. And
of course, as the lore text said you can have a wizard with Pokemon trainer
aspirations summon oozes and direct them through magic.</p>

<p>The sample encounter covers the first case: level 3, 1 ochre jelly and 3 orc
raiders.</p>

<p>This is another instance where you lose nothing by ignoring the Monster Manual
entries and going all in on the Vault’s versions. They have almost the full set
of classic oozes, and despite the many attempts by 3e to prove otherwise,
they’re enough for the vast majority of campaigns. It’s not D&amp;D if it doesn’t
have some icky goo in it somewhere.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Oni are inspired by Japanese mythology and have been in the game since the
beginning. However I believe this is the first time in official D&amp;D history in
which they’ve been called by this name. Before, they were known as “ogre
mages”. Here, they are only in the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>If I recall correctly, the name “oni” translates roughly into “ogre”! The
portrayal of oni in Japanese mythology varies depending on which story you’re
hearing. Some are just big dumb brutes best represented by the standard ogres we
just looked at. Others are still big, but they’re also smart and capable of
sinister sorceries. This is the type represented by this entry.</p>

<p>4th Edition oni look a lot like their mythological counterparts, and a bit like
ogres, though the two species are not related. Despite their great size and
strength, oni are clever and prefer subtle tactics to advance their own goals
and hurt their enemies. Most of them know how to assume illusory disguises and
turn themselves to mist, in addition to a repertoire of other spells and rituals
that match their preferred tactics.</p>

<p>The typical oni sees itself as a mighty lord deserving of respect, and is quite
vengeful to anyone whom it sees as not giving it that respect. Oni measure their
status by the wealth they’ve accumulated, along with the number and quality of
the slaves they own. They build hidden strongholds to live in and surround
themselves with all manner of luxury, and go out to enact their plans and/or
inflicting suffering on the surrounding population.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Oni are Large Natural Humanoids, proving that “Natural” doesn’t mean
“Mundane”. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 8, and a flight speed of 8
(clumsy).</p>

<p>They also have a couple of signature powers: <strong>Deceptive Veil</strong> allows them to
take the form of any Large <em>or Medium</em> humanoid. Piercing the disguise is an
opposed Insight vs. Bluff roll, and Oni tend to be good at Bluff. <strong>Gaseous
Form</strong> allows them to become insubstantial mist with a flight speed of 8
(hover), but since it requires standard actions to sustain they can’t do
anything but move around while in this form. It’s useful for escaping, or for
sneaking up to the PCs prior to the fight starting.</p>

<h3 id="oni-night-haunter">Oni Night Haunter</h3>

<p>This is a Level 8 Elite Controller with 180 HP, and it’s ironically a bit of an
exception to the typical oni portraited in the lore section. Night Haunters live
in small huts or caves, disguising themselves as elderly hermits. At night, they
fly out to sneak into villages and towns and devour sleeping victims.</p>

<p>They don’t just eat the flesh of those victims either! When faced with an
unconscious victim, the night haunter can use <strong>Devour Soul</strong> (melee 1
vs. Will)! A hit deals psychic damage, heals the oni for 10 HP, and <em>doesn’t</em>
wake the victim up.</p>

<p>If its enemies are awake, it can try to put them to sleep with its <strong>Hypnotic
Breath</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Will; recharges when first bloodied). This does no
damage, but dazes on a hit (save ends). After the first failed save this worsens
to unconsciousness, and then it’s Devour Soul time.</p>

<p>If its enemies stubbornly refuse to sleep, then the oni has to resort to its
Reach 2 <strong>Morningstar</strong> and bash their heads in. When it looks like it will
lose the fight, it likely uses Gaseous Form to escape.</p>

<h3 id="oni-mage">Oni Mage</h3>

<p>According to the book, these are often and mistakenly called “ogre mages” by
ignorant mortals, which means they’re the classic model.</p>

<p>Oni mages are Level 10 Elite Lurkers with 172 HP. They wear mail, so their
ground speed is only 7, but their flight speed remains the same.</p>

<p>In addition to Deceptive Veil, oni mages can become <strong>invisible</strong> at-will as a
standard action, which lasts until they attack. They deal extra “sneak attack”
damage on melee attacks when they have combat advantage.</p>

<p>Before engaging in melee, though, they’ll likely fire off a few attack spells:
<strong>Freezing Blast</strong> (close blast 5 vs Fortitude; recharge 6) does cold damage and
slows (save ends); and <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> (area 2 within 10 vs. Reflex;
recharge 5-6) does lightning damage with no riders.</p>

<p>When they finally engage in melee, they’ll use finely crafted <strong>Greatswords</strong>
for those sneak attacks while they wait for their spells to recharge.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounters each feature one oni and a variety of other angry
humanoids like ogres, orcs and trolls, which illustrate well who it is that the
oni usually enslave. Depending on the individual in question, they might do it
through overt conquest, or by disguising themselves as an ogre or orc and taking
over the tribe that way. As accomplished mages, oni might also be surrounded by
summoned creatures or other more exotic monsters.</p>

<p>I like oni! They work well as fairytale horrors despite their Natural origin,
and are smart enough to be used in situations where the party is forced to
negotiate with them. They’re one more type of monster that might be in
possession of a secret or ritual the PCs need to avert a worse evil.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they do need an update. Like all mid- or high- level MM elites,
they need a damage boost and something equivalent to the ability to make two
basic melee attacks per action. I’d also increase the mage’s sneak attack damage
to something more than a piddly 1d6, and probably make it apply to the spells as
well.</p>

<p>Ogres have been a part of D&amp;D since its beginnings, when they were the bridge
between the Humanoid and Giant power ladders. Here, they are present in both
books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Ogres are big, dumb, strong, and mean. So much so that there’s probably the
picture of an ogre near all of these words in your typical Nerathian
dictionary. They famously can’t count to ten even with all their fingers in
front of them, and their greatest technological achievement is wearing the skin
of their last meal as a loincloth so they can appear in official D&amp;D
illustrations.</p>

<p>Ogres live alone or in small nomadic bands. In both cases they settle into a
region, eat all available food, and move on. They don’t build complicated
shelters, instead using natural ones like caves and such. Ogres will hunt and
forage if they have to, but they always prefer to raid caravans or villages if
those are nearby. In combat, they use improvised weapons that allow them to
employ their great strength, such as tree clubs and big rocks.</p>

<p>You might be thinking this sounds a bit similar to the description for hill
giants that we already covered, and you’d be right. The main differences between
them is that hill giants are bigger, smarter, less bestial-looking and more
technologically developed, in a neolithic vs. paleolithic way. Hill giants have
some agriculture and built villages/steadings of their own. It also feels like
it’s easier to parley with hill giants than with ogres.</p>

<p>Despite their strength, ogres are easily recruited into service by monsters who
are more powerful or more numerous than them. This usually happens through a
combination of intimidation and food bribes. Ogres can be found working as shock
troops for orc or gnoll bands, or as auxiliaries and menial labor for hags,
dragons, and giants. Some of these patrons provide their ogre lackeys with
combat training and improved weapons, making them more dangerous. Smarter ogres
willingly seek out the mercenary life, working for money and arranging that
improved gear and training by their own initiative.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The traditional role of ogres in older editions of D&amp;D is as the star of a
“not-quite-boss” fight. Something that’s really hard for beginning adventurers
to face, but which they can defeat once they gain some XP and their players
become a bit savvier. Maybe you put them near the stairs to the second dungeon
level, or guarding some prime loot in a corner of the goblin lair or kobold
warren. When fighting ogres became easy for a group, they knew they had made it
out of the junior leagues. With some thought given to encounter design, it’s
still possible to have ogres in these roles.</p>

<p>Ogres are Large Natural Humanoids. The Monster Vault also gives them the Giant
keyword, in which is surely a callback to early D&amp;D. They move at Speed 8, and
seem to not be very compatible with magic of any kind: all the ogre varieties in
both books fight exclusively with physical attacks.</p>

<p>There’s quite a few varieties. The MM clusters them around the late heroic and
early paragon tier, the MV widens that band a little. I’ll look at them roughly
on the order of level, but pairing equivalent monsters from both books where
appropriate. When an ogre has equivalent versions in both books, the Monster
Vault version is usually the better one, so it gets more attention.</p>

<p>All ogres presented here are Chaotic Evil and speak only Giant, though the MM
says they might know a few words of Common such as “mine!”, “hungry!” and
“kill!”.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-mv">Ogre (MV)</h3>

<p>Ogres are the quintessential brutes, and this is the quintessential ogre. A
Level 6 Brute with 90 HP and Int 4, it wields a Reach 2 <strong>greatclub</strong> in melee
and throws big <strong>rocks</strong> at up to range 10.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the ogre can perform a <strong>Grand Slam</strong>, which does double the
damage of a normal club attack and <del>yeets</del> pushes the target 2 squares on a
hit.</p>

<p>A pair of these might fulfill the classic ogre role of “not-quite-boss fight”
for a level 1 or 2 party. Their ranged attacks make them more dangerous than old
D&amp;D ogres, though, since the party can’t just snipe at them with impunity.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-savage-mm">Ogre Savage (MM)</h3>

<p>This is Monster Manual’s take on old D&amp;D ogre. This one is a Level 8 Brute with
111 HP and the same <strong>greatclub</strong> as its MV successor. However it has no ranged
attacks, and its special melee attack is an <strong>Angry Smash</strong> (recharge 6) that
allows it to make two attack rolls and take the best result.</p>

<p>Despite being 2 levels stronger than the Vault ogre, the vagaries of the early
math make this one have the same attack bonus and damage. The only difference in
their basic stats are the 21 extra HP and defenses 1 point higher. You can still
have that not-quite-boss fight using the Ogre Savage as written, only you might
want to use one of them backed up by a troupe of weaker minions. Their lack of
ranged attacks might mitigate their extra power depending on your party
composition.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-hunter-mv">Ogre Hunter (MV)</h3>

<p>This one is a little more sophisticated, though that’s not saying much since it
still has Int 4. It’s a Level 7 Skirmisher with 84 HP.</p>

<p>The ogre hunter uses a one-handed Reach 2 <strong>club</strong> as its main melee weapon, and
carries a brace of stone-tipped <strong>javelins</strong> for fighting at range (Ranged
20). It’s <strong>Hurling Charge</strong> technique (recharge 4-6) allows it to throw a
javelin and make a charge if that hits.</p>

<p>If surrounded, the hunter can <strong>Clear the Ground</strong> by stomping really hard
(Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude; Minor Action), which pushes everyone it hits 2
squares. If anyone is hit by this attack, the ogre can move its speed. Who would
have thought the words “agile” and “highly mobile” would ever apply to an ogre?</p>

<h3 id="ogre-skirmisher-mm">Ogre Skirmisher (MM)</h3>

<p>Aside from being level 8 with 91 HP, this is pretty much the same monster as the
Ogre Hunter above. Its damage is lower due to the math bug, Hurling Charge is an
encounter power that always allows two attacks, and it lacks Clear the
Ground. It also has a <strong>Skirmish</strong> trait that gives it a damage bonus on any
turn where it moves more than 4 squares. I think it’s safe to say it has been
entirely superseded by the MV Hunter.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-mercenary-mv">Ogre Mercenary (MV)</h3>

<p>One of those smarter ogres who works for gold. This one is a Level 8 Soldier
with 93 HP and an Int of 7. It fights in melee with a Reach 2 <strong>morningstar</strong>
that marks for a turn on a hit, and throws Range 10 <strong>handaxes</strong> to fight from
afar.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on a single target with the morningstar, the Mercenary can
use a <strong>Brutal Sweep</strong> to attack everyone in a Close Blast 2, dealing a bit less
damage but knocking prone on a hit. This is an at-will attack! Alternating both
attacks makes the mercenary quite good at keeping the party busy.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-warhulk-mm">Ogre Warhulk (MM)</h3>

<p>A level 11 Elite Brute with 286 HP, the Warhulk is otherwise equivalent to the
Mercenary above. Its <strong>flail</strong> basic attack knocks prone instead of marking, and
the Brutal Sweep equivalent is an encounter power that otherwise works the same.</p>

<p>This results in a lackluster elite, since it only has one attack per round. If
you need an elite ogre, use an upgraded version of the Mercenary above.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-juggernaut-mv">Ogre Juggernaut (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 10 Brute with 131 HP, representing a larger and stronger ogre
than the basic level 6 version. It’s still Large as far as the rules are
concerned, though.</p>

<p>Ogre juggernauts have the same attacks as their smaller cousins, a <strong>greatclub</strong>
and <strong>rocks</strong>, which do more damage due to their higher level. Their signature
move is the <strong>Juggernaut Push</strong> (Melee 1 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6). If this
hits, the juggernaut knocks the target prone, pushes them 1 square, and shifts
to occupy the vacated square. They can then <em>keep</em> repeating the push-and-shift
loop until they have shifted their whole speed! They can stop early if that’s
not practical, but for every square they push the target beyond the first they
do 1d8 damage do it!</p>

<p>7d8 damage is in line with a level 10 “limited use attack”, but it looks extra
impressive because that’s a lot of dice <em>and</em> your PC just got kicked all over
the battlefield like a soccer ball.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-minions-mm">Ogre Minions (MM)</h3>

<p>When fighting an ogre becomes easy, you’ve left the junior leagues. When you
routinely face hordes of them, you’ve joined the major ones. Ogre minions come
in two varieties: level 11 Ogre Thugs and level 16 Ogre Bludgeoneers. Both use
their considerable bulk to pad out the forces of onis, hags, and other powerful
paragon-tier bosses. Aside from the level difference, they’re identical.</p>

<p>I’m tempted to make “Bludgeoneers” an official unit name for a bunch of ogre
minions. Like Mouseketeers, but with more violence.</p>

<h3 id="arena-trained-ogre-mv">Arena-Trained Ogre (MV)</h3>

<p>If you take a typical ogre and train them for a few years at the blood-sport
arenas of the Black Eagle Barony, this is what you get.</p>

<p>These ogres are Level 14 Brutes with 173 HP and an Int score of 8. They wield
<strong>greataxes</strong> in combat, and aside from their beefy basic attack they can often
make <strong>Vorpal Sweeps</strong> (Close Burst 2; enemies only; recharge 6) that do a bit
less damage to each target and deal ongoing 10 damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Simple, but effective. And while this isn’t stated in their stat blocks, those 4
extra points of Int mean this ogre is much more capable of understanding tactics
and effectively coordinating with its teammates.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounters in the Monster Manual are rather typical:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 1 ogre savage, 1 orc eye of Gruumsh, 8 orc warriors, 2 dire boars. An
ogre working as a heavy for an orc party.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 1 ogre warhulk, 2 ogre savages, 2 ogre skirmishers. And this is a
typical “small ogre band”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ogres are one of those monsters which I have a hard time finding
sympathetic. They’re the embodiment of a particular type of crass cruelty and
they fill that role well, even better than hill giants IMO.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if your main cultural reference for ogres is Shrek then it’s
perfectly possible to make them more sympathetic along those lines. While I like
the default presentation I wouldn’t mind seeing them in that light either. Just
keep those Pathfinder ogres away from my game.</p>

<p>Mechanically the Monster Vault stat blocks are better and you should use them if
possible. If you can’t, updating the damage of the MM ogres and giving the
Warhulk a second attack (or making it a regular instead of an elite) should make
them workable enough. Ogre stat blocks can also be used to represent younger or
weaker hill giants, like they were in the classic Against the Giants adventures.</p>

<p>I think Nightwalkers have been in the game since 3e - at least, that’s when I
first saw them along with other “Night-something” high level undead. Here,
they’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Shadowfell is the antechamber of the afterlife. Whenever someone dies, their
spirit spends a time here before the Raven Queen sends it to its final
destination. If an extremely strong-willed evil person dies, though, they might
be able to hold on and stay in the Shadowfell through sheer orneriness. These
eventually become Nightwalkers.</p>

<p>This origin is actually quite similar to those of Devourers, evil people who
also avoid being sent to the afterlife and make new undead bodies for
themselves. Could it be that the two are related? Maybe a Nightwalker is what
you get when a Devourer eats enough souls. Or maybe they’re simply the luckier
psychopaths who got to make themselves a body of solid shadow instead of having
to settle for corpse bits.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Nightwalkers have bodies made out of the stuff of the
Shadowfell. This gives them the ability to control the energies of that plane to
some extent, which manifests as a series of cold and necrotic powers in combat.
They’re also expert ritual casters. One of the rituals they know is the one that
makes bodaks, though power-hungry PC wizards will be disappointed to know it
only works on the Shadowfell when cast by a nightwalker on someone they
themselves killed.</p>

<p>Nightwalkers communicate through telepathy, and understand Common. They’re
highly intelligent and no doubt always have an evil scheme or two cooking, with
bodaks acting as their agents in these matters.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Nightwalkers are Large Shadow Humanoids with the Undead keyword. They’re Level
20 Elite Brutes with 464 HP and a host of passive traits. Darkvision, immunity
to disease and poison, 20 resistance to cold and necrotic, and 20 vulnerability
to radiant. They walk at speed 8.</p>

<p>They also emit a 5-square aura of <strong>Void Chill</strong>, which does 5 cold and necrotic
damage to anyone caught inside.</p>

<p>The nightwalker’s basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>slam</strong> that does some physical
damage plus bonus cold and necrotic damage. Once per round as a minor action
they can use a <strong>Void Gaze</strong> (close Blast 5 vs Will) which does a bit of
necrotic damage, pushes the targets 4 squares, and give them a -2 penalty to all
defenses (save ends). This is <em>not</em> a fear effect, so protection from fear
doesn’t work against it.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, it can use the dreaded <strong>Finger of Death</strong> spell (ranged 5
vs. Fortitude). This can only be used against a bloodied target, but if it hits
the target immediately drops to 0 HP. Necrotic resistance is useless against
this! It’s a nice thing to use with an action point as soon as someone becomes
bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 20: 1 nightwalker, 4 bodak reavers. Master and minions!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 1 nightwalker, 1 tormenting ghost, 3 death giants. This would be
more of a gathering of equals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Those encounters cover the basics of how you can meet a nightwalker: they bow to
no master, and surround themselves with either servants (all of the bodaks) or
with other creatures they respect as equals.</p>

<p>I like the concept of nightwalkers a lot, though I have to say I prefer the 3e
illustration that included nightcrawlers and nightwings. Those shadowy
indistinct shapes were a lot scarier than the thing pictured here. I can see why
the crawlers and wings didn’t make it here - they were basically the same
monster with different shapes and levels. It would be relatively easy to
homebrew them back into the game.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>In the real world, a nightmare is a bad dream. In D&amp;D it’s a bad pun that
nevertheless became somewhat iconic. They’re only in the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A nightmare looks like a horse, but is darker and edgier. Night Mare, get it?
These creatures are native to the Shadowfell, and the only equine thing about
them is their general shape.</p>

<p>Nightmares are intelligent, carnivorous, and evil. In the wild they roam in
packs, like wolves, and have a taste for sapient flesh. They can be ridden and
are particularly prized as mounts by powerful servants of evil. Getting a
nightmare to agree to work as a mount involves defeating it in combat and making
it choose between service and death. Therefore, having a nightmare of your own
is a sign that you’re a badass in addition to being an edgelord.</p>

<p>Though they are native to the Shadowfell, their high resistance to fire and
fiery appearance make me think they have something of Hell in them as
well.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We only get a single Nightmare stat block: it’s a Large Shadow Magical Beast
with the Mount keyword, and a Level 13 skirmisher with 138 HP. It has Darkvision
and trained Perception, and both land and <em>teleport</em> speeds of 10. This does
mean it can teleport at will as a move action.</p>

<p>Nightmares have 20 fire resistance, and get +2 to AC against opportunity
attacks. Their mount trait is <strong>Hell’s Ride</strong>, which grants 20 fire resistance
to the rider.</p>

<p>Nightmares fight in melee with their flame-wreathed <strong>hooves</strong>, which do a bit
of physical damage and ongoing fire damage (save ends). Their special attack is
<strong>Hooves of Hell</strong> (recharge 5-6), in which they run the speed and leave a
10-foot tall wall of fire in their wake. The wall lasts for a turn and deals 10
fire damage to anyone who enters it. Anyone who attacks the nightmare while it
makes this move also takes the same damage.</p>

<p>I imagine a nightmare has little reason to stand still while Hooves of Hell is
charged. It will play Fire Tron with the PCs for as long as it can, only
stopping to kick someone while it waits for the power to recharge. And unlike a
Tron bike it can run through its own walls just fine, even with a rider. A whole
pack of them would be, well, a nightmare to fight for PCs who aren’t resistant
to fire.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There are two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 1 nightmare, 1 battle wight commander (the rider), and 6 battle
wights.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: a medusa archer and a medusa warrior riding nightmares.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It looks like the mount rules give enemy riders and their mounts separate
actions, so that wight and the medusas can still attack the PCs while their
nightmare mounts run around setting the map on fire. When they provoke
opportunity attacks, the PCs can choose whether to target the mount or the
rider. In this case I would also have an opportunity attack against the rider
cause those 10 fire damage.</p>

<p>Despite the somewhat punny name, nightmares are cool. An evil knight type should
have an evil mount to go with it, and evil fire-horses are one of the classics
(the other being some kind of skeleton or wyvern).</p>
