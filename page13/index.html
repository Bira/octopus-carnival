<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Looks like the Monster Manual 3 is all about blurring the lines between
fiends. We have a devil who became a demon lord, demons who became devils, and
now a devil who behaves like a demon. I haven’t run into rage devils before. If
they appeared in previous editions, it must have been in a late MM or a
specialized supplement.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A Rage Devil is what happens when you take a standard Hell Knight and inject
demon ichor into it. They’re hulking brutes who are constantly angry and delight
in carnage. In other words, they’re pretty much demons, or they would be if
their flesh wasn’t bound with empowered Supernal sigils that keep them pointed
in the right direction.</p>

<p>These creatures are the result of an infernal experiment to create more powerful
shock troops to throw into the meatgrinder of the Blood War. They’re actually a
little weaker than a standard hell knight, making them a bit of a failed
experiment. Maybe they adapted the process for the mass-produced version so it
works on legion devils instead.</p>

<p>Rage devils are used as heavy elements attached to legion devil forces, and are
often placed under the command of hell knights. In their free time, these things
roam Avernus in search of demon stragglers or anyone else they can get away with
smashing.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Rage Devils are Large Immortal Humanoids (Devils), and Level 11 Brutes with 138
HP. They have Darkvision and Resist Fire 20, but they can’t fly. Their ground
speed is 6.</p>

<p>These devils are heavily armored and fight with <strong>Disrupting Mauls</strong> whose basic
attacks strip all of the target’s resistances for a turn! They have a special
technique named <strong>Demonscourge Crush</strong> (recharge 4+), which deals the same
damage as a basic attack, weakens, and strips all resistances (save ends
both). Another maneuver is <strong>Maul Storm</strong> an at-will Close Burst 2 that deals
some damage and pushes targets 3 squares. If they’re bloodied, they’re also
knocked prone.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Blood Rage</strong> passive trait makes them deal extra damage on all attacks
against bloodied opponents.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Rage devils are indeed an excellent weapon both against demons and against other
devils, as well as any creature type that relies on high elemental
resistances. Behavior-wise they tend to be on the shallower end of the <em>demon</em>
cliche pool, with only their binding rituals preventing them from turning on
their devilish masters.</p>

<p>As I said above, I’d probably say most rage devils are modified legion devils,
because baseline Hell Knights are both stronger and smarter than these things,
so turning a Hell Knight into a Rage Devil is a bit of a waste.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This is the first time I come across passion devils, but they give me strong 3e
vibes.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Do you want to employ seductive and manipulative devils in your villainous
schemes, but feel that succubi are too nice? Fierna, archdevil ruler of
Phlegethos, sure did! In order to fulfill her very specific needs, she created
Passion Devils.</p>

<p>The reason these creatures give me a strong 3e-or-earlier vibe is that they feel
like the sort of grid-filling exercise that was very common in those
games. Succubi were considered demons back then, so when they needed to fill the
“seductive manipulator” niche on the devil side they created a completely new
creature.</p>

<p>In 4e, passion devils are kinda like a specialized succubus variant tied to
Fierna. As incarnations of her vanity, they’re made in her image but always have
some extra imperfection in their forms so their mistress remains the fairest of
them all. They’re sent to infiltrate mortal societies just like a succubus, and
they’re also used to replace the leadership of Fierna’s own cults so she can
keep tabs on them. When used as official emissaries and ambassadors, they are
often protected by a unit of bearded devil bodyguards.</p>

<p>The main difference between a baseline succubus and a passion devil is that the
latter have serious anger management issues. When their tempers flare, their
disguises tend to melt away as the passion devil abandons all subtlety and
resorts to force. This is obviously what happens when the PCs thwart their
plans, but it could also happen if they run out of patience while trying to
employ standard succubus strategies. At least their fire powers make them better
combatants than succubi when the jig is up.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>These creatures are Medium Immortal Humanoids with the Devil keyword, and Level
16 Controllers. They have Darkvision, Resist Fire 20, and move at speed 6 on the
ground or in the air. A pretty standard devil toolkit.</p>

<p>They project a charm aura (1) that makes others see them as a <strong>Object of
Desire</strong> and take a -2 penalty to saves against dazing effects.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>claw</strong> that targets Reflex and does fire damage. They
can also be “gentler” and employ a <strong>Fiery Touch</strong> that does less damage and
dominates for a turn. The ability that combos with their aura is <strong>Beckoning
Whispers</strong>, a non-damaging attack against Will that pulls targets 5 squares and
dazes them (save ends).</p>

<p>Finally they have an area attack named <strong>Passion’s Flames</strong>, a Close Burst 3
that deals fire damage and forces any dominated enemies it hits to make melee
basic attacks against targets of the devil’s choice.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the passion devil can <strong>change shape</strong> to appear like a
Medium humanoid. The DC to see through the disguise is a respectable 36, but
it’s less stable than that of a succubus and ends when the devil attacks.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>It’s a Succubus Plus with a temper. Lore-wise they’re Fierna’s trademark
servants, so they fit into any adventure where she’s the main enemy. Otherwise
you might want to use leveled-up succubi from the Monster Vault, or reskin these
into succubi as appropriate.</p>

<p>I don’t remember seeing hell wasps before, but they sound like the sort of
monster that might have debuted in 3e.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In past editions the Blood War was this eternal alignment-based conflict, but
here it’s part of Asmodeus’ safety net. You see, the other gods don’t
like Asmodeus very much, both because he’s an evil asshole and because he got
his position by murdering a popular non-evil deity.</p>

<p>One of the measures he took to prevent them from ganging up on him was to commit
the considerable armies of Hell to the task of containing the demons of the
Abyss. As we mentioned before, demons are too busy with infighting to launch
regular invasions on the rest of the universe, but when they do manage to
briefly get their shit together and spill out, they find a few legions of devils
waiting to fight them. Hell also launches occasional raids into the Abyss to
prevent demons from organizing.</p>

<p>This isn’t a war that rages on eternally, but a series of sporadic conflicts
that flare up whenever one of the two sides feels a bit stronger. The gods lets
Asmodeus be because he provides a valuable service, and because providing that
service also serves as a check on his power. Asmodeus and his underlings in the
meantime keep enacting diabolic schemes to acquire more power in an attempt to
dominate the other gods.</p>

<p>One of the most enthusiastic participants in the Blood Wars seems to be Glasya,
Asmodeus’ daughter. Because of this she tends to be involved in stories where
demons and devils switch sides, corresponding to her failures and successes. We
already heard about Graz’zt the devil who became a demon lord. And now we get to
hear about a whole species of demon who became devils.</p>

<p>Hellwasps were once a species of demon related to the insectile mezzodemons,
servants of a wasp-like demon lord whose name was lost to time. Glasya fought
and killed this demon in one of her raids, and its spawn immediately swore
allegiance to her. She took the lot of them to Hell and converted them into
devils. Now they inhabit the Garden of Delights, a region of Malbolge. As loyal
servants of Glasya, they can be found alongside any of her other servants or
allies.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Hellwasps are Medium Immortal Magical Beasts (devils). They have Darkvision and
a Flight Speed of 8 (hover), but their ground speed of 0 means they can’t
actually <em>walk</em>. They fight with their natural weapons: a pair of sword-like
talons, and a huge venomous sting.</p>

<h3 id="hellwasp-colony-guard">Hellwasp Colony Guard</h3>

<p>This is a Level 19 Minion Skirmisher of the kind you can find by the score in
hellwasp hives. Their <strong>Sword Talon</strong> attack allows them to shift 1 square
before or after the attack, and their <strong>Sting</strong> deals poison damage, slows, and
prevents the target from shifting for a turn.</p>

<p>They’re good for slowing the PCs down and setting them up to be surrounded by
sturdier allies. The ability to shift away after a talon attack makes them
slightly less vulnerable to melee-centric PCs.</p>

<h3 id="hellwasp-devil">Hellwasp Devil</h3>

<p>The regular version is a Level 23 Skirmisher with 212 HP. Since it’s higher
level it probably represents an exceptional individual within a hive, of the
kind that gets loaned out to allies and sent on away missions.</p>

<p>Aside from a somewhat weak <strong>Sword Talon</strong> attack, the hellwasp can also perform
a <strong>Talon Skewer</strong>. This also counts as a basic attack. It allows the wasp to
fly its speed and make two talon attacks at any point along the movement. The
wasp doesn’t draw opportunity attacks when moving away from the target of these
attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the wasp grabs them, and the
<strong>Drag Off</strong> trait allows it to pull the grabbed victim when it moves without
drawing opportunity attacks from them.</p>

<p>Yes, this is another one of those fliers that allows you to have fun with
cliffs. And at epic level we’re probably taking the cliffs of Hell itself, which
have lava pools or other layer-appropriate hazards at the bottom.</p>

<p>Hellwasp regulars also have a stronger <strong>Sting</strong>. It deals more poison damage,
slows, prohibits shifts and deals ongoing 15 fire damage (save ends all). This
is a “recharge 5+” attack, and a good one to use on a PC that was dragged off to
an isolated position.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Bugs with sword-arms that slot neatly into the same slot as Swordwings. Perfect
for those players who dislike monsters that lack ties to AD&amp;D lore. You can
reskin these into swordwings, or take inspiration in swordwing abilities when
building more hellwasp varieties.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they’re interesting without overstaying their welcome. It’s always
fun to see a monster who can carry PCs off and drop them into lava pits.</p>

<p><a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/09/20/death-knight.html">Death Knights</a> have a long and storied existence in D&amp;D, but this is the
first time I hear of Hell Knights.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Hell Knights are absolutely not Nazgul, no way, no how. They’re <em>narzugons</em>,
which is a completely different thing. Jokes aside, their origins are quite
tragic.</p>

<p>The first hell knights used to be servants of He Who Was, the god Asmodeus
rebelled against. Asmodeus tricked them into betraying their former master, and
their betrayal damned them to serve Asmodeus forever. From that point forward,
whenever someone got tricked into betraying their deity, they would become new
hell knights upon death.</p>

<p>I think this is the first time I see an explicit mention of people going to Hell
and becoming devils in 4e. This used to be a 3e thing, so I guess Hell Knights
come from that edition. It could also be that angels and other immortals become
hell knights when they get tricked into betraying their deities, if you want to
play it that way.</p>

<p>Though hell knights are powerful, becoming one is definitely a form of
punishment. A Hell Knight’s existence is an eternity of hatred. They hate
themselves for their betrayal, they hate their new masters, they hate their
immortality, and they hate free mortals. Though many of them serve Asmodeus
directly, every potentate of Hell has at least a few knights at their
disposal. The most famous group of them is the Order of the Nightmare, so named
for their preferred mounts. Other groups have other mounts, like the
mammoth-riding knights of Cania, or the ash riders of Avernus with their
wyverns.</p>

<p>Hell Knights usually only associate with members of their own order, but will
work together with other devils when commanded to do so.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Hell Knights are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils), and Level 15 Soldiers with
146 HP. They have Darkvision, are immune to fear, and have Resist 20 Fire. Their
ground speed is 6, but they will almost always be mounted on something
faster. Their gear is the full “Classic Knight” setup of plate armor, heavy
shield, a lance, and a mace.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Hell’s Rider</strong> trait allows their mount to use the knight’s Athletics,
Acrobatics and Stealth scores if they would be better than the mount’s own. The
<strong>mace</strong> does bonus fire damage and knocks prone on a hit, and the <strong>lance</strong> has
better base tamage and crits on a 19-20 when used on a charge. Both count as
basic attacks.</p>

<p>As a minor action they can use <strong>Eyes of the Narzugon</strong>, which causes a creature
within 10 squares to be marked and slowed for a turn. This is an effect, so it
auto-hits.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Hell Knights pair really well with Nightmares! As I mentioned in the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/08/09/nightmare.html">Nightmare</a> article, enemy riders can still take actions independently of
their mounts, so the knights can charge with their lances and maces at the same
time their nightmare mounts set the map on fire. Since they have native fire
resistance, they can ignore the burning terrain even when unhorsed.</p>

<p>A simple but effective hell knight encounter would consist of three knights and
three nightmares, using classic medieval cavalry tactics (charge early, charge
often). This group’s lack of ranged attacks would be compensated by the
nightmare’s high teleport speed.</p>

<p>Remember when I told you the MM3 had the very good idea of giving each devil and
demon its own entry rather than lumping them all together? Here’s where they
kinda toss that out the window and make a big entry full of diverse stat blocks
for a single type of devil.</p>

<p>Corruption Devils, or Paeliryons, first appeared in one of the later Monster
Manuals for 3rd Edition. I remember they were not very well-received because
their lore and appearance had some quite unfortunate implications. This book is
still making an effort to make them a big part of the game, so let’s see if the
lore improved in any way.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The book describes these devils as “bloated infernal masterminds of graft,
sleaze, and vice”. They’re better at politics and intrigue than almost anyone
else in Hell, and they put that skill to use in subverting mortal societies to
their benefit, turning them into decadent kleptocracies via a network of agents
and dupes. Most paeliryons work for Dispater, lord of the second layer of Hell,
acting as the civil administration of that wretched city.</p>

<p>A corruption devil’s agent network is somewhat inverted from what you’d
expect. Its most powerful members are kept at a safe remove from the devil,
while those that work directly with it are ignorant sycophants and expendable
muscle.</p>

<p>I see that they kept the Paeliryion illustration from the previous edition, but
if I’m remembering it correctly the lore was changed to something a little less
problematic. With an extra decade of hindsight, I’d probably replace the Ursula
cosplay with a big suit and an orange wig.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<h3 id="corruption-devil">Corruption Devil</h3>

<p>The basic model, depicted in the illustration. These are most likely to be found
running the city of Dis, but can also go out into the other planes to perform
specific missions. Though physically imposing, the creatures prefer to avoid
direct conflicts, and will try to negotiate their way out of trouble. If forced
into combat they fight like PC bards, staying away from the melee and hurling
magically-charged insults and mind control spells at their enemies.</p>

<p>They pal around with other manipulative devils such as succubi, vizier devils,
and cambions, though these are almost always pawns rather than full allies. If
things see to be going bad for it, the paeliryion will definitely fly away and
abandon its “friends”.</p>

<p>Corruption Devils are Large Immortal Humanoids (Devils), and Level 22
Controllers (Leaders) with 208 HP. They have Darkvision and a +5 to save against
fear and charm effects. Their ground speed is only 4, but they’re excellent
fliers with speed 6 (hover).</p>

<p>These devils project a <strong>Corruptive Presence</strong> that works as an aura (5) and
inflicts a -2 penalty to saves on all enemies inside its radius. It fights in
melee with <strong>Corrupting Claws</strong> and at range with <strong>Words of Corruption</strong>, both
of which deal no immediate damage and instead inflict ongoing psychic damage
(save ends).</p>

<p>Their mind control magic takes the form of two minor-action spells. <strong>Sway the
Corrupt</strong> (at-will) targets an enemy that’s taking ongoing psychic damage. It
hits automatically, and dominates them for a turn. <strong>Doom the Corrupt</strong>
(recharge 5+) targets an ally or a dominated creature, forcing them to make a
melee basic attack against an enemy of the devil’s choice. If that attack hits,
its target is also immobilized (save ends).</p>

<p>Finally, it can use <strong>Desperate Measures</strong> as a minor action to allow an ally to
make a basic attack that crits on 19-20, in exchange for the ally granting
combat advantage for a turn. This recharges when the devil is first bloodied,
and if used while it’s bloodied it applies to every ally within 5 squares
instead of just one.</p>

<h3 id="sire-of-corruption">Sire of Corruption</h3>

<p>These are the most powerful corruption devils, and among some of the most
powerful devils in Hell. They’re the ones who run long term projects of the
“turn a whole kingdom to evil” variety, and have a particular strong hatred of
“incorruptible” people or institutions, working extra-hard to prove that
assertion wrong or destroy these offenders if they can’t. Sires of Corruption
can make a particular kind of infernal contract that can make the signing mortal
gain power from utterly embracing their vices, thought they still remain pawns
of the devil in the end.</p>

<p>These creatures are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils), and Level 29 Elite
Controllers (leaders) with 530 HP. They have 15 fire resistance and a ground
speed of 6, but no special senses.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Lasting Corruption</strong> aura is actually a bit worse than that of a basic
corruption devil, since the save penalty only applies to charm effects. All of
their non-basic attacks are charm effects, so it doesn’t make a difference to
the sire itself, but it’s less helpful to its allies.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Corrupting Touch</strong> that does a sizable amount of
psychic damage and inflicts a -2 penalty to defenses against charm effects for a
turn, so you want to alternate it with the other attack: <strong>Touch of Vice</strong>
(recharge 4+), which deals the same amount of psychic damage and inflicts one of
<em>six</em> possible effects named after different vices or sins. They’re all (save
ends), and have the following effects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lust</strong> causes the target to be marked by another enemy within 5 squares.</li>
  <li><strong>Excess</strong> dazes.</li>
  <li><strong>Greed</strong> slides the target 5 squares to a space adjacent to one of its
allies, and forces it to make opportunity attacks against allies whose actions
would provoke them.</li>
  <li><strong>Fear</strong> pushes the target 5 squares and forbids it from moving closer to the
sire of corruption.</li>
  <li><strong>Sloth</strong> immobilizes.</li>
  <li><strong>Vengeance</strong> auto-damages the target whenever they use an attack power.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sire chooses which effect happens whenever it hits with Touch of Vice.</p>

<p>But that’s not all! At the start of the fight it can issue a <strong>Call to
Corruption</strong> to summon six Corrupted Followers into the fight, and it can do
that again after it’s bloodied! As a minor action it can use <strong>Spread
Depravity</strong> to give one of these servants a free attack.</p>

<p>And finally, when the sire is reduced to 0 HP, it uses a final attack named
<strong>Lasting Vice</strong>, which targets everyone in a Close Burst 5 with a Touch of
Vice (same damage, same choice of effects).</p>

<p>These things are nasty, and unlike basic corruption devils they want to get
right into the fray while surrounded by their corrupted servants.</p>

<p>These are mortals who were prey to some vice in life, and who were offered a
very specific kind of infernal contract in their moment of greatest despair or
misery. The contract gives them what they desire, and immediately afterwards
turns them into monsters made of the same vice that controlled their mortal
lives.</p>

<p>Followers retain no memory of those lives. Left to their own devices, they
contrive to spread their ruling vice among the surrounding population. Most
often, though, they’re found in the service of their devil master. Usually this
is a Sire of Corruption, but it can also be some other powerful devil, or some
mortal villain to whom the fiend has loaned them.</p>

<p>Corrupted Followers are epic-tier minions, and there’s a different variety for
every vice a Sire of Corruption can generate. It’s entirely appropriate for the
Sire’s Call to Corruption power to summon a full sentai team with the six
varieties, but you can vary its composition to have simpler combats.</p>

<p>Each Follower type has a touch attack that targets Will and does a bit of damage
with a rider, an effect that happens when it dies, and sometimes an aura or
passive trait. All of those will be related to each Follower’s Thematic
Vice. Here they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lust</strong>: Corrupted Lechers are Level 24 Minion Lurkers. They can’t be
targeted unless they’re the closest enemy to the attacker; their attacks can
be melee or ranged, and make the target be marked by another enemy for a turn;
when they die, they make their killer move its speed towards another enemy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Excess</strong>: Corrupted Gluttons are Level 25 Minion Soldiers that attack with
bites that also grab the target. Once they have a target grabbed they can chew
on them for automatic damage. When they die, they curse their killer to take
damage next turn unless the PC recovers HP in the intervening time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Greed</strong>: Corrupted Mongers are Level 26 Minion Artillery. Their melee
attacks slide the target adjacent to one of their allies; their ranged attack
drain daily or encounter powers from magic items until the end of the
encounter! When they die, they cause any daily or encounter powers from the
item that killed them to become spent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sloth</strong>: Corrupted Idlers are Level 27 Minion Soldiers. They have a small
slowing aura, and their attacks prevent the target from taking move actions
for a turn. When they die, they make an attack against the killer’s Will that
will knock the PC unconscious for a turn on a hit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vengeance</strong>: Corrupted Lunatics are Level 28 Minion Brutes. Their attacks
are weak even for a minion, but force the target to make a basic attack
against its nearest ally. If someone misses then with an attack, they can make
a free attack against that PC, with the same rider as above. When they die,
their killer must again make an attack against an ally. They’re walking Three
Stooges skits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fear</strong>: Corrupted Cravens are Level 29 Minion Controllers. When they hit
with an attack, they force the target to move its speed away from them. The
same happens to their killer when they die.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I guess I’m still not entirely sold on the whole “Corruption Devil” lore. It
feels kinda redundant because this sort of thing was already supposed to be one
of the central themes for Hell as a whole. And the stat blocks use the word
“Corruption” so much it kinda starts to lose its meaning. The Sire of Corruption
seems like it was an entirely different monster that got retrofitted into this
entry. It’s obviously inspired by the Seven Deadly Sins, which I feel is kinda
played out. But at least it’s all seven in one monster, and it <em>is</em> in-theme for
Hell.</p>

<p>Mechanics-wise, the Corruption Devil stat block might work quite well for any
bard-type enemies, with a few minor adjustments. The Sire of Corruption is a
scary combatant, but its mechanics are extremely tied to the concept of sin so
it might be harder to reskin. It would make an excellent basis for an Aspect of
Asmodeus, though!</p>

<p>The minions are flavorful, but fiddly. I wouldn’t recommend using the full
spread in the same encounter.</p>
