<p>In their second field-op, our brave <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">X-COM squad</a> saw new enemies with new
equipment, so it’s time to update the Arsenal of Ruin! This post will focus on
the gear carried by the Elite Puppets, also known as White Masks.</p>

<h2 id="white-mask-gear">White Mask Gear</h2>

<p>White Masks are elite Puppets of Ruin in service to the Ebon Masters. Like their
“lesser” brethren, they are borne as fruit from the Trees of Ruin, but they only
appear in the heart of the woods where the Trees of Woe are older. At the stage
where our campaign stopped, there were still no trees old enough to drop elite
puppets, so the ones the party met are all “imported” from off-world.</p>

<p>In the original Dreams of Ruin material, elite puppets carried TL 8 military
equipment equivalent to that of a first-world military soldier: automatic
assault rifles and more modern rocket launchers. For this campaign, they had to
step up their game, as that sort of gear is starting equipment for my PCs.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/03/30/x-com-arsenal-of-ruin.html">equipment carried by normal puppets</a>, all of this gear is produced
by the trees themselves along with the puppet that wears it. The only “custom”
addition by the Ebon Masters here is painting the masks on their armors white to
denote rank within their organization. This equipment is meant to be more
advanced than anything carried by modern Earth infantry, but it’s still
considered somewhat cheap and low-end by the aliens.</p>

<h3 id="puppet-assault-rifle">Puppet Assault Rifle</h3>

<p>Compared to the standard-issue puppet rifle seen in <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/03/30/x-com-arsenal-of-ruin.html">Part 1</a>, this bullpup
design fires a lighter 7mm round at a much higher rate of fire. It has an
electrothermal-chemical (ETC) action and uses the High-Cyclic Controlled Bursts
rule from <strong>High-Tech</strong>, p. 83.</p>

<p>This weapon also has an integral underbarrel grenade launcher that fires 25mm
rounds with greater force and accuracy than its TL 8 counterparts.</p>

<p>The Puppet Assault Rifle lacks any targetting electronics, as the puppet’s
supernatural senses fill the same role. It is otherwise extremely reliable and
easy to operate, being able to work for years in adverse conditions without
regular maintenance. It is operated with Guns (Longarm), or with Guns (Rifle)
and Guns (Grenade Launcher) under the standard rules.</p>

<p><br /> The weapon is usually loaded with standard ammunition (in table), but it’s
perfectly capable of firing APDS (9d(2) pi-) or APEP (7d(3) pi-) rounds. Both
would ruin the day of those players who think their vests-with-plates make them
immune to puppet weaponry. Even without armor-piercing ammo, they’re still smart
enough to aim for the arms and legs if they notice center-of-mass shots don’t
result in an immediate kill.</p>

<p>The grenade launcher is usually loaded with TL9 HE or thermobaric warheads
(<strong>Ultra-Tech</strong> p. 153 and 155), though the Ebon Masters can certainly issue
crueler and/or higher-TL loads to their servants if the mission calls for it.</p>

<h3 id="white-mask-armor">White Mask Armor</h3>

<p>The White Mask Armor suit covers the torso and head in rigid plates of the same
composite material used to make puppet swords. The neck and limbs are covered in
a mesh of ultra-tech ballistic fibers equivalent to Reflex armor (from
<strong>Ultra-Tech</strong>). All of this material is colored a dull gray, except for the
helmet plates, which are white.</p>

<p>The suit is sealed, chemically-coated and contamination-proof, but does <em>not</em>
feature ports for air tanks or even a visor, as its intended wearers have no
need for such things. In fact, it can’t even be removed from the puppet wearing
it without being cut open.</p>

<p>The White Mask Armor provides DR 30 to the torso, groin and head. It provides DR
20 against cutting and piercing damage and DR 10 against all other damage types
to the limbs and neck. While DR 30 is a little less than the DR 35 provided by a
TL 8 assault vest with trauma plates, this DR is <em>not</em> semi-ablative like that
of the plates, and is more than enough to stop rounds from an X-COM issue
assault rifle. The full suit is also about a bit lighter than the starting
“heavy armor” package for PCs and provides more DR to all non-torso locations.</p>

<h2 id="using-white-mask-gear">Using White Mask Gear</h2>

<p>Each Elite Puppet wears a White Mask Armor suit, and carries a Puppet Assault
Rifle with 4 reloads for the rifle and 2 for the grenade launcher. They also
each carry a sword and a couple of hand grenades, and may carry a Puppet RPG or
extra rounds for one carried by a squadmate. These items are described
in <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/03/30/x-com-arsenal-of-ruin.html">Part 1</a>.</p>

<p>These weapons also fall within the “second tier” of my tech tree. Researching
these weapons would have allowed X-COM to make similar versions for themselves,
which would have the advantage of not being tainted by spores. They never did
get a “researchable” White Mask corpse, but if they had they could have obtained
a version of their armor that’s actually fit for human use. Having access to at
least this much would enable the PCs to better stand up to the sort of alien
that would show up later on, as their successes mounted.</p>

<p>As promised in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/04/dark-judas.html">last post</a>, this one will contain the spoilers and fight
analysis for Operation DARK JUDAS. For the rest of the Actual Play, take a look
at its <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">project page</a>.</p>

<p>The first encounter on <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/04/19/dark-judas.html">Part 1</a> didn’t show any new enemies, but did
introduce players to the fact that the trees drop puppets when threatened. This
time they were quite a bit better at staying out of melee range, and the puppets
were undone by their own overconfidence despite being able to do some damage.</p>

<p>There’s no shocking revelations in the “Puppet Theater” fight in <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/04/29/dark-judas.html">Part 2</a>
either, aside from the fact that puppet theater is a thing. As I said in that
part, I messed up by not having additional battle-ready puppets show up when the
PCs grenaded the tree.</p>

<p>Things get a lot more interesting when we get into the firefight
on <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/04/dark-judas.html">Part 3</a>. There was a lot of new stuff packed into it! The players didn’t
manage to figure out much before they left, but I’m laying it all out here.</p>

<p>The downed alien craft was a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimana">vimana</a>, which is why it looked like a
house. It was originally piloted by the alien the PCs rescued, who had defected
from the Ebon Masters (the alien faction using the forest as a weapon). Despite
their exotic looks, these magic-powered vimanas have more or less the same
capabilities as the UFOs in the original games.</p>

<p>The two factions having a firefight over the vimana and its pilot had found the
crash site just like X-COM did and were converging on it with the goal of taking
everything they could. The people occupying the vimana itself were indeed
humans, something the PCs would have noticed if they had managed to approach
them a bit more. That doesn’t mean they were friendly! This was the first
on-screen appearance of X-ALT. They likely wouldn’t have fired at the PCs right
away, but would take their help and backstab them later.</p>

<p>The group firing at them from the ruined building were Elite Puppets in direct
service to the Ebon Masters. This explains the white masks. Elite Puppets in the
original rules have somewhere between 5 and 7 hit dice as opposed to the 3 of
the rank-and-file, and these were similarly improved over their GURPS
counterparts, making them better in a fight than all but the most badass human
action heroes. On top of that, they had some pretty beefy TL 9 gear, including
armor that made them basically immune to assault rifle fire from the PCs.</p>

<p>The PC’s biggest mistake here was sticking too close to that black tree by the
container, since its emissions allowed the puppets to spot them. Puppets can
<em>see through cover</em>, particularly when they have the trees spotting for them, so
once they noticed the players they only took distance penalties to
attack. Retreating was a wise decision!</p>

<p>It would have been nice to play out the extended fight/chase scene as the PCs
retreated through the woods back to where they had stashed the puppet RPG, but I
didn’t think there would be a fun way to do it over a forum, so I abstracted it
out with a contest of Tactics and simply narrated the outcome. The PCs won by a
small margin, so they managed to get the puppets in place for Choi’s shot (which
I did roll as an attack). That was the only real way to harm the enemies they
had left, as they had already spent all their frag grenades on earlier
encounters and those wouldn’t guarantee a kill either.</p>

<p>All in all, the PCs did about as well here as could be expected. I really wish
we could have played out the White Mask encounter in more detail, but such is
the way of play-by-forum games.</p>

</figure>

<p>In my <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/01/hells-rebels-player-guide.html">last post</a>, I went over the Player’s Guide and provided some GURPS
conversion notes. Today we’ll look at the actual scenes of the first adventure
in the Path, <strong>In Hell’s Bright Shadow</strong>. Seriously, what does that name even
mean?</p>

<h2 id="part-1-fledglings-of-silver">Part 1: Fledglings of Silver</h2>

<p>The goal of this part is to get the PCs on track to restoring the Silver
Ravens. It begins with a protest!</p>

<h3 id="the-aria-park-protest">The Aria Park Protest</h3>

<p>As the story begins, the PCs find themselves in Aria Park, so named because it’s
right next to the Kintargo Opera House. Paracount Thrune is catching a show
inside the Opera House while a huge crowd protests outside, watched by his
guards. Thrune has been in power for a couple of weeks, and in that time he’s
issued seven odd proclamations that generally make city life inconvenient.</p>

<p>The player’s guide to Hell’s Rebels describes many possible reasons for why the
PCs would be here. Two of the most interesting ones are looking for a famous
performer who recently disappeared and looking for a contact who has information
about the Silver Ravens secret society, which was rumored to defend Kintargo
from outside threats in the past. They could also simply be here to participate
in the protest, people-watch, or simply tag along a friend with a stronger
reason to be there.</p>

<p>Of our four Iconic PCs, I imagine <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/08/pathfinder-df-bard.html">Lem</a> would be the one most interested in
getting in contact with a resistance movement and looking for info on the
legendary Silver Ravens. <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/15/pathfinder-df-cleric.html">Kyra</a> might be concerned about the fate of Shensen,
a half-elf singer who was very outspoken both about her faith in Sarenrae and
against the evil of House Thrune. She is currently missing. <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/30/pathfinder-df-rogue.html">Merisiel</a> would
definitely be here to riot and pickpocket people, and aimless <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/27/pathfinder-df-knight.html">Valeros</a> would
just tag along, likely to keep Merisiel out of trouble. The rules in the
Player’s Guide actually give out skill bonuses for each different motive and
further bonuses depending on different background traits chosen by the PCs. In
GURPS, I feel none of that is necessary, since the system already has a good
skill system. The GM should instead guide the players to buy some social and
subterfuge-related skills with their points, as they would be important
throughout the campaign.</p>

<p>This is a big, chaotic gathering: you have quite a few people protesting
<em>against</em> Thrune for several different reasons, some loyalists protesting <em>for</em>
him, and a handful of yahoos who just want the riot to start already. There’s
several actions the PCs can take here, which include looking for that mysterious
contact, suppressing one or more factions, organizing the protest, or simply
picking people’s pockets. Suppressing the loyalists or yahoos will bring
benefits later on. The PCs also get XP for performing successful actions - this
seems to be a common thing here, as the adventure path is very particular about
getting them to the appropriate levels for each scene.</p>

<h3 id="the-eighth-proclamation">The Eighth Proclamation</h3>

<p>After a few hours of this, The Barzilai makes an appearance, and makes his
eighth proclamation. The previous seven were things like banning mint and
embroidered clothing, or bounties for live dogs. This one forbids all ship
captains not born on Kintargo from leaving their ships and setting foot on
the city under pain of torture. The stated reason for it is that Barzilai has
the best brain and noticed his subjects have been angry about out-of-towners
nosing in on their business. So he’s going to solve the problem, bigly, with a
ban.</p>

<p>This absurd proclamation starts a riot, which is what Thrune actually
wants. Why? He simply feels like watching his guards and loyalists beat up some
protesters.</p>

<p>As soon as the riot starts, someone throws a handful of manure at Barzilai, and
while that missile misses its mark it causes him to spill some wine on his fancy
robes. This sends him into a rage, and he orders his main bodyguard Nox and the
dottari under her command to move in and start killing people. At the same time,
the off-brand Brown Shirts of the Chelish Citizen’s Group that were infiltrated
in the crowd draw their clubs and begin attacking the protesters as well.</p>

<p>The players must fight a gang of four CCG thugs to start with, and they get to
witness Nox’s powers of regeneration as she shrugs off a dagger to the throat in
a “cutscene”. I guess the idea here is that the party should get away as soon as
possible. The thugs are basically shclubs with clubs who shouldn’t pose too much
of a problem, but sticking around for too long attracts a pair of the stronger
and better-armed dottari. Finally Nox comes in with a pet hellhound and a squad
of 12 dottari guards. That last bit would be a clear sign that the four
1st-level characters must run away - the crowd certainly does! If they still
stick around, the hellhound focuses on them.</p>

<h4 id="gurps-conversion-notes">GURPS Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>There’s two ways to go about this here. GMs who want to be true to the fiction
could give the Chelish Citizen’s Group thugs average stats, clubs, and a couple
of points in Shortsword, while using the 62-point Guard template from <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy 15</strong> with decent gear for the dottari.</p>

<p>Those who want to make things more challenging for their delvers should go with
the Guard template for the thugs, perhaps upgrading them to light armor and
small maces. The guards would be built using the 125-point Squire or Brute
templates. This is also closer to what the Pathfinder version does with the
stats for these people.</p>

<p>Nox should be built <em>at least</em> on a 250-point Knight template with special
powers added on, and the Hell Hound can be built using the guidelines
on <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/17/wolves.html">this post</a> from the Dragon’s Dogma bestiary.</p>

<p>In either case, a party of four 250-point delvers would have far less trouble
dealing with the riff-raff than the 1st-level Pathfinder PCs. If they’re smart
and lucky they could even beat the final pack of 12 guards plus Nox and her
hellhound right here! Kyra does know Resist Fire…</p>

<p>The GM might want to increase the number of dottari to a realistic level, since
12-14 of them wouldn’t be able to contain a riot of thousands anyway. Or they
could keep the numbers as they are and deal with the changes an complete victory
here would bring to the story.</p>

<h3 id="a-new-friend-in-need">A New Friend In Need</h3>

<p>In any case, after the party leaves the site of the riot, they hear sounds of
fighting from a nearby alley. There, five CCG thugs are in the process of
beating a man to death. Since this man happens to be the contact one of the PCs
is looking for, it’s in their interest to crush the thugs and save the
man. Unlike the thugs in the riot, these ones fight to the death, but they
should still be manageable. There’s an extra XP reward for succeeding in helping
Rexus, too.</p>

<p>Their victim is Rexus Victocora, the young scion of the nicest noble family in
Kintargo, who of course was disappeared and had their house burned down in the
Night of Ashes. He survived because he was out of the house at the time. Rexus
has either taken an interest in the PCs during the protest or was the one who
called them here in the first place with promises of information on the Silver
Ravens. After going somewhere private, he tells them the story above, and how he
plans to fight back against Thrune’s takeover but needs help.</p>

<p>Our hypotethical party would readily accept the request, and yours should too. I
mean, they’ve been telling you to make that sort of character since the Player’s
Guide.</p>

<p>Anyway, once the PCs are on board, Rexus reveals his parents left him a letter
in which they confessed to be members of the Sacred Order of Archivists, a
secret society dedicating to uncovering and preserving the <em>true</em> history of
Kintargo, as opposed to the heavily redacted official version. The letter also
tells of how they feel the Silver Ravens must fly again if the city is to stand
any chance against this new oppression, and says that the Fair Fortune Livery is
rumored to be one of their ancient safehouses. Rexus needs help investigating
the place because he’s not exactly adventurer material. By way of compensation,
he offers most of the rest of the stuff his parents left him, which include some
money and valuables, a silver dagger, and a set of <em>bracers of armor +1</em>. He
keeps the letter and a mythril key, which will be important later.</p>

<h3 id="the-fair-fortune-livery">The Fair Fortune Livery</h3>

<p>Thus begins the first official “dungeon delve” of this adventure! This place
used to be a slaughterhouse-turned-stable and conceal a minor Silver Raven
safehouse, but has been abandoned for quite a while. Rexus wants to come along
and help investigate despite not being a combatant, but will accept it if the
PCs tell him to sit this one out instead. Bringing him along turns this into
something of an escort quest, and is worth a little bit of extra XP at the end.</p>

<p>The delve begins in the livery’s the ground level. It’s mostly empty and in
ruins. Some locked doors and a small pack of feral dogs are the main obstacles
here. Once the dogs are dealth with the grimples (small, annoying, evil fey
beings) from the basement come up and begin to play poltergeist. In any case, it
shouldn’t be hard for the PCs to find the trapdoor going down.</p>

<p>Next comes the basement, which was mostly used when the livery was a
slaughterhouse. What 1st-level adventure is complete without a basement full of
rats? Also here is the grimple nest, where the PCs finally have a chance to get
rid of the pests and pillage their treasure (which includes a <em>cloak of
resistance +1</em>).</p>

<p>The hideout proper is situated in some old city ruins accessible from the
basement. The main problem with them is that the ancient Silver Ravens
unwittingly brought a devil’s contract here when they plundered a cache of
government documents, and the imp bound to it has been trying to find a way to
leave the place for 80 years. One of those attempts summoned two lemure devils
who now spend their time mindlessly wallowing in a polluted cistern. It’s a good
thing the PCs have that silver dagger with them, because lemures are resistant
to everything else. They are otherwise not terribly dangerous, but serve as a
warning that things down here are Not Right.</p>

<p>There’s three boxes in here full of loot: the first has some interesting armor
and weapons including a silver morningstar, which means this delve is an example
of that annoying trope where the weapon to kill a monster is in a box behind the
monster. The second box is locked and contains a bunch of spell scrolls and the
hundreds of pages of documents that are the actual goal of the quest. And the
third has six <em>figurines of wondrous power</em> in the shape of silver
ravens. They’re useful for secure communication and are in fact the origin of
the group’s name. The party could also sell them off for a fat load of cash,
something the adventure begs the GM to prevent.</p>

<p>The afore-mentioned imp, named Blosodriette, is also here - her contract is
somewhere inside the second box. She limits herself to watching invisibly and
hoping someone takes the box away so she can go along. It’s possible a canny
party might spot and confront her here - if they don’t she’ll cause trouble
later on.</p>

<h4 id="gurps-conversion-notes-1">GURPS Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>Rats and dogs already have stats for GURPS! Grimples are SM -3 or -4 fairies
with minor telekinetic abilities and the ability to cast the Grease spell, which
should make a fight against them look more like a bad comedy movie than actual
combat. Lemures aren’t exactly fearsome combatants, but they should have plenty
of DR against non-silver weapons. Even so, this will be a walk in the park for
250-point delvers.</p>

<h3 id="the-long-roads-coffee-house">The Long Roads Coffee House</h3>

<p>After the party retrieves the documents, Rexus takes then to the Long Roads
Coffee House to meet Laria Longroad, the proprietor. This halfling is a member
of the Bellflower Network, which is Kintargo’s equivalent of the Underground
Railroad.</p>

<p>Laria is quite happy to support the PCs in their rebellious efforts, not the
least because her extensive network of contacts and informants is mostly gone
now (Thrune hates abolitionists). In fact while she would be glad to let them
crash in the secret hideout underneath the coffee house, she doesn’t even have
control of <em>that</em>. A smuggler buddy of hers went in there to stash a cargo of
contraband silks and never came out. It’s been days. If the PCs want a temporary
home base, they’ll need to do some cleaning.</p>

<p>The hideout occupies the coffee house’s basement and those of the two abandoned
houses to either side of it. It has bunk rooms, a large storeroom, and a dock
leading into an underground river. There’s an albino alligator chilling in the
river, but it’s not the main source of trouble here.</p>

<p>You see, Mr. Smuggler Buddy didn’t just bring a shipment of cloth here, he also
brought a group of tengu sisters on the run from the law back in Varisia. The
plan was to hand them off to another smuggler who would take them the rest of
the way to their destination, but the Night of Ashes put an end to that. When
the guy told the sisters they were on their own, they beat him unconscious, and
then one of them got a little too enthusiastic and killed him. Now they’re holed
up down here, in the dark, despairing about what to do.</p>

<p>Pathfinder tengu are basically raven-people. The sisters aren’t automatically
hostile, but getting in their good graces will take some doing. There’s four of
them, plus Chough, the “enthusiastic” sister, who is actually an adopted dire
corby and basically responsible for all the trouble the rest have gone
through. Dire corbies look kinda like tengu, but are a lot stronger and less
psychologically stable. The lead sister, Korva, has recently decided Chough
needs to be put down. It’s actually quite possible the party will run into a
murderous Chough before they meet Korva, so that’s one thing taken care of, I
guess.</p>

<p>Particularly diplomatic parties can convince the sisters to stick around and
join the Silver Ravens, becoming a “special unit” under the rebellion management
rules in the Player’s Guide. If they can’t manage that, they can still let them
leave without a fight as long as they don’t try to pin Mr. Smuggler’s death on
them. PCs get XP for dealing with them whether there’s combat or not, and a
little bonus for telling Laria about her buddy’s fate.</p>

<p>Once the sisters are dealt with one way or the other, the party gains the use of
this hideout as a temporary base while they set out to rebuild the Silver
Ravens. We’ll take a look at how that goes in the next installment.</p>

<h4 id="gurps-conversion-notes-2">GURPS Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>Korva should be a 250-point stabby Thief not too different
from <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/30/pathfinder-df-rogue.html">Merisiel</a>. Her sisters are 125-point Cutpurses, with Chough probably
being a monstrous Barbarian who fights with Talons and a Sharp Beak and has
serious Berserk and Bloodlust issues. Give her some natural DR, extra HP and
perhaps one or two levels of Extra Attack if you want her to stand up to the
whole party by herself.</p>

<p>This is an entry in the Dragon’s Dogma bestiary. The remaining entries along
with the full adaptation can be found <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Gryphons are considered a symbol of strength and victory in Gransys, much like
in the real world. These creatures used to be considered mythical, but the
coming of the Dragon has proved otherwise. One such beast has taken roost in the
ancient ruins of Bluemoon Tower, and ranges as far as Gran Soren in its search
for prey, devastating herds of cattle and attacking unwary caravans. There might
be others.</p>

<p>The Basic Set actually has stats for a gryphon in page B461, but those would
only suit a smaller than average individual in this setting. The gryphon of
Bluemoon Tower is much larger, and able to carry a grown person away with
ease. It’s also clever enough to fly away if it thinks itself overmatched, so
hunting it has proven particularly difficult. Ending its threat would mean
undertaking an expedition to Bluemoon Tower and facing the many dangers therein.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 25; <strong>DX</strong> 14; <strong>IQ</strong> 5; <strong>HT</strong> 13</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 11; <strong>DR</strong> 3 (Tough Skin); <strong>SM</strong> +3</p>

  <li><strong>Talons x2 (15)</strong>: 2d+1 cutting. Reach C-2. May grapple at skill-15. Parried
as a weapon.</li>
  <li><strong>Flyby Attack (-)</strong>: The Gryphon can perform a Move and Attack maneuver to
swoop down, strike with its talons, and fly back up, covering a distance equal
to its Air Move in total. The attacks are made at no penalty. The talon attack
can be a <em>grapple</em> instead, which if successful means the gryphon carries the
victim with it.</li>

<h2 id="gryphon-variants">Gryphon Variants</h2>

<h3 id="cockatrice">Cockatrice</h3>

<p>Unlike the small variant presented in <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 3</strong>, the
Gransys cockatrice is a huge creature that looks like a gryphon from far
away. Upon closer inspection, one can see its avian half resembles more a turkey
or buzzard than an eagle, with black feathers and fur.</p>

<p>In addition to possessing the same natural weapons as a gryphon, the cockatrice
can spew a cloud of noxious gas that turns any who breathe it to stone! And
unlike the gryphon, it will never run from a fight.</p>

<p>Use the same stats as for a gryphon, but add the following attack:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Petrifying Breath (16 vs. HT)</strong>: Covers an area 5m in diameter in front of
the cockatrice. Any who fail the listed resistance roll are turned to stone as
per the Flesh to Stone spell. Can be used once every 10 seconds.</li>
</ul>

<p>Welcome to another mission report for <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">GURPS X-COM: Noises in the Dark</a>! Our
characters for this mission are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kendall Fairbarn</strong>: A paranoid hacker from the UK. Was completely convinced
human society had been heavily infiltrated by shape-changing aliens… and it
turned out he wasn’t entirely wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Minette Duvall</strong>: A bomb-disposal expert from Southern France, Minette is
also quite handy with a rifle. She’s devoutly Catholic and swears a lot when
faced with danger, which is all the time. Currently wounded and minding the
Skyranger as an NPC.</li>
  <li><strong>Niu Yulan (AKA Julia Yulan)</strong>: A former hostage negotiator from China, built
without a template but approaching a shootier Face. Her innate kindness and
empathy came in handy in several of the missions! Currently controlled by
Minette’s player.</li>
  <li><strong>Jack Choi</strong>: A former police detective from Hong Kong, and a staunch
adherent of the “kick down the door” school of policing despite his light
frame.</li>
  <li><strong>Sam McCall</strong>: A brave and burly former US Army Ranger, run by a new player.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="white-masks">White Masks</h2>

<p>In our <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/04/29/dark-judas.html">last post</a>, Strike One approached a crashed UFO and found itself
witnessing a large firefight between unknown factions. They were too far away to
positively ID either of them, and so after a brief discussion on what to do
decided to sneak closer to get a better look.</p>

<p>Heading east while keeping to the cover of native vegetation, the squad
approached the former Samarco building currently occupied by the grey-clad
people they saw from afar. On the way they sneak past a couple of rusted, empty
containers which have been abandoned close to the edge of the woods. Turning a
corner on one of the containers, they almost bump into a Tree of Woe growing
flush against its wall! Taking care not to touch the tree, they observe the
building, now only 30m away.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/crash-site.png"/>
  <figcaption>
  Annotated map of the scene.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The squad recognizes its occupants as Puppets of Ruin from the way they move,
but their equipment is different from what they’ve seen so far. The grey outfits
are some sort of futuristic armor covering their whole bodies, with a white
faceless helmet or mask covering their faces and skulls.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/white-mask.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>
  <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/art/Noza-37340050"/>
    Kinda like this, but eyeless.
  </a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some of the puppets have painted ghastly smiles on their masks, but other than
that they’re completely featureless. Their weapons are rifles capable of
automatic fire, with underbarrel semi-automatic grenade launchers. As for the
other side, they’re still about as far away as they were before, so the PCs
can’t ID them.</p>

<p>It takes about a minute for the squad to observe all of this, which is when they
notice one of the white-masked puppets stop shooting at the other party and
raise a hand to where its ear would be in a gesture not unlike that of an Agent
from <em>The Matrix</em>. It then looks directly at the party, despite there being no
way it would be able to spot them from its current position!</p>

<p>As that puppet begins to raise its weapon in the direction of the party, they
hear wet slapping sounds behind them, and turn to see that tree near the
container dropping another three-puppet fireteam! The newcomers are close enough
to attack with their swords, and they do just that.</p>

<p>Strike One is able to shoot them dead in short order, but the time it took for
them to do that was enough for the masked puppet to aim and fire its grenade
launcher, greatly damaging their cover and stripping the surrounding foliage
bare.</p>

<p>The squad elects to begin a fighting withdrawal through the woods back to the
north. Julia and Sam fire away at the “White Mask” as the others retreat, and
though they’re pretty sure they managed to hit its center of mass several times,
it doesn’t seem to react at all. The return fire sounds more like tearing silk
than gunfire. Several of the bullets hit Julia and chew through her trauma
plate, with at least one getting through and wounding her.</p>

<h2 id="blue-mask">Blue Mask</h2>

<p>The PCs retreat behind one of the steel containers, and manage not to get shot
again even as White Masks’ buddies join in on the fun. The shooting stops
momentarily when a titanic explosion erupts from somewhere to the south, and as
its roar subsides they can hear a faint whimper from within the neighboring
container. Choi and Kendall throw some smoke grenades to give them some
concealment, and then Choi and Julia move to investigate the other container.</p>

<p>Inside, they find an alien! They almost shoot it out of reflex, but stop when
they notice this one doesn’t seem to be a combatant. Unlike the puppets, this
individual is 1.5m tall at most, wearing a skin-tight dark grey outfit and with
a skin or carapace of a very dark purple, two legs and four arms. Its face is
vaguely human, but it’s a bright royal blue and has a prodigious nose
reminiscent of a crane’s beak.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/blue-mask.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>
  Kinda like this.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The alien is huddled in close to the container’s north end from where Julia and
Choi comes in, and as soon as it spots them it raises its two top arms and
shouts “Sparing us!”. Julia lowers her weapon and manages to talk to the
creature, who becomes quite relieved when it sees the squad is friendly and that
they bear the X-COM insignia on their uniforms. It’s apparently been looking for
them! It’s obvious to the PCs that escorting this real live alien back to base
is now their top priority.</p>

<p>There isn’t much time to talk, however, as three White Masks are quickly making
their way to the squad’s position. Kendall pops more smoke in an attempt to
delay them, but the alien warns in its peculiar dialect that it doesn’t
work. The squad begins retreating to the Skyranger with their new charge in a
tense game of cat and mouse with their three pursuers, which not only are better
equipped than the “newborn” puppets they’ve been facing but are also much more
tactically savvy. Their armor also seems to make them largely immune to even the
PC’s assault rifles!</p>

<p>Choi then remembers the alien RPG they stashed a ways away, and runs ahead to
fetch it and lie in wait. Though they experience a couple of scary close calls,
the rest of the squad manages to lead the puppets to the trap and clear out
before Choi fires the surprisingly light alien launcher and obliterates the
three puppets.</p>

<p>With that done, there’s no further obstacle between them and the Skyranger. They
strap themselves and the alien in, and take off, concluding the operation.</p>

<p>The spoilers and fight analysis for this operation deserve their own post, since
they would make this one run too long. And after that, we’ll see what
consequences this operation had on the campaign’s strategic layer.</p>
