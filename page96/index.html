<p>This is an entry in the Dragon’s Dogma bestiary. You thought I had droppped
this, didn’t you? The remaining entries along with the full adaptation can be
found <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Like gryphons and chimeras, hydras are a heraldic animal in Gransys, symbolizing
endurance in battle. Hydra sightings are vanishingly rare, for not many of these
monsters exist in Gransys and even fewer people who saw one up close lived to
tell the tale.</p>

<p>A Gransys hydra looks like a gigantic four-headed snake, covered in shiny black
scales. Its four necks tower over the ground at the height of a cyclops, and its
main body is even larger. Its four heads can spit a jet of numbing poison, and
and swallow a grown man whole. Despite this, the creature lacks substantial
fangs and its jaw muscles are more suited for immobilizing victims than for
outright crushing them. Should the hydra have need of crushing someone, though,
it can simply slam its heads, necks, or tail into the victim.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 50; <strong>DX</strong> 13; <strong>IQ</strong> 5; <strong>HT</strong> 15;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 60; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 15;</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong> 7; <strong>Move</strong> 8 (Slithers); <strong>SM</strong> +5;</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 10; <strong>DR</strong> 6 (neck); 9 (elsewhere).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Head Slam (15)</strong>: 6d+3 crushing; Reach C-4; The hydra slams one of its heads
into the target.</li>
  <li><strong>Miasma Spit (15)</strong>: A 2 meter radius area of effect in front of the
hydra. Targets exposed to the venom must roll HT. Success means 1d injury,
failure means 2d. Targets also suffer a -1 penalty to DX for every 2 injury
sustained, which lasts for 1 minute. Costs 2 FP per use.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (15)</strong>: The target is grappled with ST 52! In subsequent turns the
hydra will attempt to swallow the target (treat it as an attempt to pin). See
Notes below for how to rescue a swallowed target.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Sweep (15)</strong>: 6d+3 crushing with double knockback; Targets a 3 meter
radius area of effect behind the hydra. Can only be dodged, not parried or
blocked!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Extra Attack 3; High Pain Threshold; Horizontal; Hydra Regeneration
(see below); No Legs (slithers); No Fine Manipulators; Nictitating Membrane 3;
Night Vision 9; Peripheral Vision;</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Brawling-15; Wrestling-15; Innate Attack-15;</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<h2 id="hydra-tactics">Hydra Tactics</h2>

<p>The hydra can do <em>something</em> with each of its heads each turn, or give up one
head’s action for a tail sweep. Each head counts as a separate individual for
the purposes of being targetted with mind-affecting spells or the like.</p>

<p>Despite its feasome size and prowess, a hydra has the mind of a beast. It will
usually attack because it’s hungry! In these cases, its usual tactic is to
impair one of more targets with its Miasma Spit, then bite and swallow them. It
will retreat once it has had its fill or suffered significant injury.</p>

<p>Hydras are also highly territorial and will fight any who trespass on their
lairs to the death.</p>

<h2 id="fighting-a-hydra">Fighting a Hydra</h2>

<p>A cumulative 15 injury from cutting weapons to a neck will sever one of the
hydra’s heads. 2d seconds later, the head will grow back, and the hydra will
regain the lost HP. The stump must be burned with natural or magical fire to
prevent this from happening! Severing and cauterizing the last head will of
course kill the beast.</p>

<p>Someone swallowed by a hydra can still be saved in the 10 seconds it takes for
them to travel down the beast’s neck if the offending head is severed before
then. If they reach the creature’s body they will automatically take 6d+2 cr
damage per second from its innards, which practically guarantees a swift death.</p>

<h3 id="giant-climbing">Giant Climbing</h3>

<p>It’s possible for a brave or suicidal warrior to climb the neck of a hydra! It’s
skin is mostly smooth but still provides some handholds, giving a -2 to any
Climbing rolls. Someone clinging to the neck of a hydra can target the neck at
no penalty with a one-handed melee weapon, but the beast can still attempt to
crush the pest by slamming its neck against the ground. Treat this as a “Head
Slam” attack. The target has a -2 penalty to Dodge it unless they let go of the
hydra.</p>

<h2 id="hydra-variants">Hydra Variants</h2>

<h3 id="archydra">Archydra</h3>

<p>The original game also features the “Archydra” in its most difficult dungeons,
beyond the Rift. This variant is white instead of black, harder to hurt, and
does have fangs. It has DR 9 in the neck and 12 elsewhere and can bite for 6d+2
imp damage instead of grappling if it wishes.</p>

            <p>In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Links to all of them will appear in the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">project page</a>, which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Scout, not because it’s in order but because it’s the
one I’ve written. This means today’s character is Harsk the Ranger. Here he is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Harsk.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Just Look at all that compressed rage! His <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Harsk">bio</a> does give him plenty to be
angry about. Harsk’s official stats are <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/harsk.html">here</a>. From these we can learn the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Harsk is a Dwarf from Varisia, a “wild frontier” region that doesn’t have any
blatant ties to real-world cultures. He was a bit of an outsider to his own
stereotypically Dwarven community, and appointed himself a keeper of justice
in the wild places after his brother was killed by raiding giants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He carries his brother’s axe with him, but his preferred weapon is a heavy
crossbow he made himself. Understandably, he has giants as a favored enemy and
gains bonuses to fight them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He’s skilled in wilderness survival, particularly in mountains, and very
perceptive.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This puts us in something of a pickle. DF Scouts are excellent at shooting bows,
but Harsk’s preferred weapon is the <em>crossbow</em>. While that’s much more in line
with the dwarven idiom, it’s not supported by the standard Scout template in
<strong>Adventurers</strong>. Fortunately, it’s possible for me to add new material to
support him without copying anything printed in other GURPS books! Even in
standard GURPS the traits below were only sort of <em>implied</em>, so I also had to do
this for the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/05/pathfinder-df-ranger.html">previous version</a> of the character.</p>

<h3 id="heroic-crossbowman-20-points">Heroic Crossbowman (20 points)</h3>

<p>This is just like Heroic Archer, but for crossbows instead of bows. You can
choose this version <em>instead</em> of Heroic Archer when making a Scout. It gives
almost exactly the same bonuses: simply replace the Bow skill with Crossbow
where applicable. The only difference is that there isn’t a corresponding Weapon
Master specialty for crossbows. All other advantages described under Special
Scout Traits are compatible with this one.</p>

<h3 id="quick-reload-1-point">Quick Reload (1 point)</h3>

<p>If you have Heroic Crossbowman, you can also purchase this advantage. It allows
you to reload a crossbow of your ST or lower in a <em>single turn</em> with a
successful Fast-Draw (Arrow) row, reducing the total ready time of the weapon
from 4 to 2 seconds: one to reload, one bring the weapon into position. If you
do this and use Heroic Crossbowman’s fast-firing technique, you can fire your
crossbow every turn!</p>

<h2 id="harsk-250-point-dwarf-scout">Harsk, 250-point Dwarf Scout</h2>

<p>ST 13 {30}; DX 14 {80}; IQ 11 {20}; HT 13 {30}</p>

<h2 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h2>

<p>Strongbow and Lifting ST 2 allow Harsk to fire a ST <em>17</em> crossbow despite only
having ST 13. While he’s also a pretty good axe fighter in a pinch, his main
focus is reaching out and touching people from very far away.</p>

<h3 id="changes-from-the-first-iteration">Changes from the First Iteration</h3>

<p>The dwarf racial template changed slightly, and following the <strong>DFRPG</strong>
guidelines I just mixed its traits in with the professional template rather than
taking the time to mark what belongs to the racial template and what
doesn’t. And since there’s no general purpose Mortal Foe trait here, this
version of Harsk doesn’t have it. Instead, he sees in the dark a lot better, and
is able to shoot a bigger crossbow.</p>

<p>His gear actually doesn’t change all that much, as he only had a DR 1 leather
jacket before too. There’s no tea set listed in DFRPG, I believe, but I didn’t
think there would be any harm in keeping it.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/11/16/pathfinder-dfrpg-knight.html">Valeros the Fighter in Dungeon Fantasy</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Links to all of them will appear in the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">project page</a>, which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Knight, which means today’s character is Valeros the
Fighter. Here he is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Valeros.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m kinda torn on Valeros, to be honest. His character design and <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Valeros">bio</a> are
the blandest among all the Iconics I’ve seen, but his adaptation is very
interesting mechanically. This is because the Knight template is the complete
opposite of the d20 Fighter. It <em>really is</em> as good at fighting as advertised,
which means its as valuable to the party as any wizard or cleric.</p>

<p>Anyway, from Valeros’ bio linked above and his <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/valeros.html">official stats</a>, we learn the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Valeros is from the nation of Andoran, his world’s “18th century US”
equivalent. He’s the typical farmboy who ran away from home and towards
adventure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He wears medium armor and fights with paired swords. He likes making lots of
attacks on vulnerable enemy locations. He has a bow as a backup for ranged
combat.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There’s not much more to him. In the GURPS version we’ll give him paired
broadswords because unlike d20 there’s no restriction on using them here. The
Knight template didn’t change much between GURPS DF and the DFRPG, but there is
one thing preventing me from just copying the original stats here: the DFRPG
lacks the Dual-Weapon Attack technique, not even in the form of a simplified
powerup. So here I replaced it with Ambidexterity and Sacrificial Parry, making
him a bit worse at attacking multiple times per action but better at protecting
his buddies.</p>

<p>If you have access to GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 11: Power-Ups, simply switch those
two traits for the Two-Weapon Fighting (Broadsword) advantage, which would allow
him to attack twice in a turn without penalties. His skills in this version are
also slightly different, and once again the gear list uses the new armor table.</p>

<h2 id="valeros-248-point-human-fighter">Valeros, 248-point Human Fighter</h2>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/10/29/rick-and-morty.html">My Review of Rick and Morty</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This blog is supposed to be only about roleplaying games, but if I don’t get
this out my mood will forever be ruined. In any case, please note that this
article only represents my own opinion.</p>

<p>I’ve seen people rave about Rick and Morty for a while now, but until my brother
decided to show it to me I had never actually watched it, save for the first
minute or so of the pilot. The show’s fans, my brother included, always say it’s
very smart and funny. Based on those first thirty seconds, I had the suspicion
it would be “smart” and “funny” in the same way South Park and Family Guy were.</p>

<p>My brother showed me what he considers the most iconic episode of Rick and
Morty, the one with the nested artificial universes. And based on that episode
and on the others I watched that day I must say I was wrong. Rick and Morty is
not as bad as South Park and Family Guy. It’s <em>worse</em>.</p>

<p>You see, when you watch this show you closely follow the antics of a sociopathic
buffoon with the power to destroy the world. You see every horrible thing he
does in lurid detail. And he always gets away with it, whatever “it” might be
this episode. This is in turns horrifying and depressing. It’s too much like
reading the news in real life. In short, it’s <em>not funny</em>.</p>

<p>But is it “smart”? Well, a lot of the show’s episodes use pretty nifty science
fiction ideas as a starting point, and have Rick twist them into some sort of
nightmare scenario. So yeah, this show is smart in the same way My Little Pony
porn is cute. Both make me die a little inside.</p>

<p>And yes, I watched the Pickle Rick fight scene. It’s very well animated and
coreographed, and its whole purpose seems to be making Rick look good. It’s
the Fox News of fight scenes.</p>
