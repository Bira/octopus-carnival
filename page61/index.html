            <p>Octopus Carnival is back from is hiatus! I’ll resume my writing here with an
article that’s not directly related to any of my ongoing projects. One goes
where inspiration strikes, after all.</p>

<p>Inspiration in this case came from <a href="https://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com.br/2013/05/my-modified-df-mook-rule.html">this post</a> from Peter V. Dell’Orto over
at Dungeon Fantastic, about how the mook rules he uses on his Dungeon Fantasy
campaign. That got me thinking about the several different iteration of these
rules present both in GURPS itself and on other systems. In this article I’ll
talk a bit about those and introduce a variation on them that I’ll likely use
for my own games.</p>

<h2 id="minions-with-many-names">Minions With Many Names</h2>

<p>Mooks, Minions, Extras… by now the concept of them is probably well-known to
most roleplayers, as a bunch of RPG systems has been codifying the concept for
decades now. Since every game has a different name for this rule and I don’t
want to keep listing them all, I’ll use the name “Minions” in this article.</p>

<p>Simply put, minions are weak enemies that pose little threat to player
characters individually, and who are present in the game mostly to show case how
competent said PCs are. They have simplified statistics and usually go down with
one good hit from a PC. They take inspiration from a long line of action and
adventure movies, where it’s common for the badass protagonists to mow through a
large group of minions over the course of an action scene, or on the way to
fighting a tough, named foe. They also tend to feature heavily in chase scenes,
where their narrative purpose is to crash and burn with every maneuver the hero
pulls off to confound them.</p>

<p>The <em>concept</em> of minions has been around since the early days of D&amp;D and its
hordes of low-HD enemies pitted against mid- or high-level parties. The first
time I saw it explicitly named and codified was with Exalted and its rules for
Extras, though it almost certainly wasn’t the first system to do so. Many others
tried their hand at it, including D&amp;D 4th Edition with its Minion rules.</p>

<p>GURPS itself multiple sets of minion rules. In the core book, each minion is an
individual opponent: they always go down in one hit, and they never use Active
Defenses (but also never All-Out-Attack either). <strong>GURPS Action</strong> and <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy</strong> toughen them up a bit by allowing active defenses and allowing
for several different grades of opposition. <em>Swarms</em> are large groups of
“minions” treated like a single, abstract creature, and again we have a version
in the <strong>Basic Set</strong> and a couple more elaborate ones in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> and
other sources. I’m sure people have come up with their own variations as
well. So here’s mine! It’s focused on distinct individuals rather than on
swarms. For now, I’ll use the standard published rules for those.</p>

<h2 id="octopus-opposition">Octopus Opposition</h2>

<p>This is how I intend to grade my opposition from now on, from weakest to
strongest. The system takes inspiration from the existing GURPS rules, and also
from the several different grades of opposition presented by D&amp;D 4th Edition and
early Shadowrun (with its Professional Levels).</p>

<p>Please note that this system is most appropriate for cinematic games that follow
at least <em>some</em> “action movie” conventions regardless of their point
level. Grimly realistic games should stick to the <strong>Basic Set</strong> rules (which are
the equivalent of making all enemies Elite under this system). Campaigns that
sit somewhere in the middle could ellide the lower opposition grades and make
everyone at least a Worthy.</p>

<p>While higher-grade opposition is <em>usually</em> more skilled at fighting
than lower-grade foes, its final grade is as much a matter of narrative
importance as of pure power. In a campaign following action-movie narrative
rules, you are more likely to find higher-grade enemies the closer you are to
the story’s climax, or to your mission objective. Named NPCs are also more
likely to be of a higher grade than the troops they command even if they are
equally skilled, because the GM usually wants the NPC to stick around for a bit
longer and be memorable.</p>

<p>This also means that it’s perfectly possible for a given individual to move
between these grades depending on the circumstances of the story. That one lucky
goblin minion that managed to inflict significant damage on the party and escape
without a scratch might return as a worthy or better at a latter date if the
players become obsessed with defeating it. In the case of Horde Ninjas, this
progression could happen over the course of a single fight!</p>

<p>Belonging to a specific grade is always a “campaign feature” and as such never
costs or gives points.</p>

<h3 id="minions">Minions</h3>

<p>Minions are the equivalent of fodder in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> or <strong>Action</strong>. They
fight and defend themselves normally, but it only takes a single point of damage
getting past their DR to bring them down. This doesn’t necessarily represent
killing. A “downed” minion might be unconscious, wounded, or even actively
fleeing! Whatever happens, though, they <em>are</em> 100% out of the fight at that
point. Obviously, it’s still possible to interact with a defeated minion who is
still alive after the fight.</p>

<p>While minions can theoretically have very high skill levels and fight with fancy
techniques, they usually don’t. They tend to come in large numbers and their
tactics leverage that. This grade is appropriate for those goblin and dinoman
hordes, cheap hired thugs, or the regular forces of the evil Star Empire. Any
monster called out as fodder in official materials would be a minion under this
system.</p>

<h3 id="tough-minions">Tough Minions</h3>

<p>Also known as “purple” minions for entirely jocular reasons. They’re like
regular minions, but a little more ornery. A tough minion has an HP total like a
normal character, but always fails combat-related HT rolls. This means that any
hit that forces a “Knockdown and Stunning” roll will take them out, as will
reaching 0 HP or less. They can take a few scratches and keep going, but a solid
hit still breaks them. These are basically Petter V. Dell’Orto’s fodder
monsters, though they never recover from stunning before the fight ends. They do
recover in time afterwards, of course.</p>

<p>This grade is appropriate for pretty much the same types of foe as normal
minions in those cases where the GM wants to make things a bit more challenging,
or when the group in question has a reputation for strength but the GM doesn’t
want them to steal the scene. They’re your goblin veterans, experienced
mobsters, or those Imperial soldiers with the black armor that talk in sinister
coded radio transmissions.</p>

<h3 id="worthies">Worthies</h3>

<p>Worthies are the “standard” level of opposition. They defend themselves
normally, including making HT rolls to avoid and recover from knockdown and
stunning, but go down once they reach 0 HP or less. They’re a significant
obstacle, but you still don’t want them to stick around <em>too</em> long. The same
examples listed for Tough Minions also make suitable worthies, as does any
monster from the books not specifically listed as fodder.</p>

<p>Worthies still tend to come in groups, though these will be smaller than groups
of minions. A movie fight against five or six opponents who keep getting back up
after being hit is employing worthies instead of minions! Note that this doesn’t
mean worthies are necessarily low-skill opponents. At this level, there is no
inconsistency whathosever in making them as skilled as the PCs themselves.</p>

<h3 id="elites">Elites</h3>

<p>Elite enemies are treated just like PCs. They make full use of all of the
campaign’s combat rules. When they reach 0 HP or less, they’ll keep making HT
rolls to stay conscious and alive, and might fight to the death if they think
it’s warranted. When they don’t, retreating is always their own decision rather
than something the rules force them to do. Elites are almost always named NPCs
with their own personalities and motivations. They are rarely less skilled than
the PCs themselves, and are often better. A fight against such an opponent
usually marks an important plot milestone in adventures following movie logic.</p>

<p>Any enemy from the books who is supposed to still pose a threat when under 0 HP
is probably an Elite. Boss Monsters from <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> also fit here -
they are usually more <em>powerful</em> in terms of statistics, but they receive the
same level of plot protection as the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="special">Special</h3>

<p>Every category system needs a catch-all! Special opposition has something that
gives it even <em>more</em> narrative protection than the PCs, or that makes it not
quite fit in the ranking system above. Colossi with multiple parts that must be
destroyed in order? Multi-stage bosses that switch character sheets entirely
when defeated?  Anything goes!</p>

<p>This is the fifth post of a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to
<strong>GURPS</strong>. Previous posts can be found below:</p>

<p>From a distance, harpies look like man-sized owls, with round heads and thick
plumage. Only when they take flight and turn on you is it possible to notice
their human-like faces and upper torsos. These features are invariably those of
women: though there are male harpies, it’s impossible to tell the difference
without dissection.</p>

<p>Harpies also have feminine voices, though they seem to be incapable of verbal
communication. In fact, they behave like large birds of prey, nesting at high
altitudes and ranging far and wide in search of prey. Harpies are full
carnivores and will attack anything that seems meaty enough to sustain them -
even people. They are an ever-present hazard in Gransys’ highlands and mountain
passes.</p>

<p>Note that these harpies are different from the those presented in <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 3: Born of Myth and Magic</strong>. You are free to use those
here as well!</p>

<p>No one has managed to tame a harpy, but those crazy enough to try are willing to
pay handsomely for unhatched eggs. Fetching those would require climbing the
steep crags where they make their nests, a challenging proposition even if one
doesn’t have to contend with a choir of enraged harpies on the way up.</p>

<p>These creatures originally came from beyond the world: ancient accounts of past
draconic invasions report armies of them arriving through the same rift as the
Dragon itself. Several stable populations remain:</p>

<h2 id="brown-harpies">Brown Harpies</h2>

<p>These inhabit the mountain chain separating South and Central Gransys, as well
as the mountains to the soutwest beyond the Shadow Fort. Their skin is an ashen
grey, covered in dark brown feathers.</p>

<p>Brown harpies have innate magical abilities: their song can compel other
creatures to sleep, an effect that becomes stronger the more voices are added to
the choir. Brown harpies live in bands (“choirs”) of 4-6 adults.</p>

<p>Brown harpies fight by using their soporific song and then grappling their
sleeping victims and dropping them from a great height. If they can’t do that
(because the target is too heavy, or resists the song), then they’ll attempt to
rake with their talons. As detailed in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 3</strong>, harpy
flyby attacks receive the -4 for Move and Attack but don’t have their skill
capped at 9, and they may retreat <em>up</em> while dodging to receive a +4 bonus.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 15; <strong>DX</strong> 13; <strong>IQ</strong> 6; <strong>HT</strong> 13</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>DR</strong> 2;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 15; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 13</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6.50; <strong>Move</strong> 3 (Ground)/13 (Air)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Soporific Song (15 vs Will)</strong>: Resisted by Will, at -1 per singing harpy
beyond the first. Affects non-harpies within 10m who hear the song. First
failure causes sluggishness (1/2 Move and Dodge) while the song lasts. Second
failure causes the target to fall asleep for 1 hour or until awoken, possibly
by being dropped from a great height by the harpy.</li>
  <li><strong>Talons (16)</strong>: 1d+3 cut. Reach C. May also <em>grapple</em> at skill 14.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (16)</strong>: 1d+2 cut.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 2; Claws (Talons); DR 3 (Tough Skin); Flight (Winged);
Peripheral Vision; Striking ST 4; Teeth (Sharp); Bestial; Fragile; Social Stigma
(Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Aerobatics-14; Brawling-16; Wrestling-14</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Faerie.</p>

<h2 id="snow-harpies">Snow Harpies</h2>

<p>These inhabit the northern highlands of Gransys, particularly the area known as
Souflayer Canyon. Their skin is black, and their feathers are snow-white with
black spots. Snow harpies possess the same soporific song as their southern
cousins, and are also endowed with a deadly frost breath attack. Use the same
stats for a brown harpy, but add Temperature Tolerance 2 for cold and the
following attack:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frost Breath (14)</strong>: Jet (range 5/10). 1d cr damage with no knockback and no
blunt trauma. Targets hit by this must roll HT with a penalty of -1 per 2
points of damage suffered or be frozen (paralyzed) for 1 minute per margin of
failure. Each snow harpy can use this only once per fight.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="succubi">Succubi</h2>

<p>While they share some similarities with harpies, succubi are demons rather than
mere magical creatures. Immortal spirits given physical form, they linger in
sites of ancient draconic invasions, or close to the Dragon itself during
them. Visually, the main difference between an harpy and a succubus is that a
succubus’ lower body and wings are those of a bat, not a bird. Their fur and
wing membranes are dark brown in color.</p>

<p>They have all the same abilities as common harpies, but their bite also carries
a deadly venom, and their touch carries a curse. Take the stats for a brown
harpy and add Immunity to Metabolic Hazards as well as an 1d toxic follow-up to
their bite. Add the following attack:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Demonic Curse (15 vs. Will)</strong>: Targets an enemy the succubus can see,
suffers from range penalties. Targets who lose the contest suffer from a
1-point Curse as per the spell on <strong>GURPS Magic</strong>, p. 129. Doesn’t work on an
already cursed target.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="silver-sirens">Silver Sirens</h2>

<p>These creatures resemble silver-colored succubi, and are actually guardian
spirits summoned by forgotten sorcery. Therefore, they can usually be found in
dungeons protecting something important. Unlike all other monsters presented in
this article, they are not only sapient but also know magic! While Silver Sirens
can fight in much the same way as harpies, they prefer to cooperate with
stronger guardian beasts, which they target with healing and support spells
while staying out of melee reach.</p>

<p>To make a Silver Siren, take the stats for a Brown Harpy and add Immunity to
Metabolic Hazards. Remove Bestial, change IQ to 12+, and add Magery 2+ along
with Healing and Body Control spells meant to buff allies. This magic requires
song, in the same manner as that of a bard.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Wizard, which means today’s character is Ezren. Here he
is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Ezren.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2007 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a fairly tame design, especially when compared to some of the other
characters in this series. Ezren’s bio is <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la45?Meet-the-Iconics-Ezren">here</a>, and his stats
are <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/ezren.html">here</a>. From these we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ezren got into adventuring late in life, after wasting his youth trying to
clear his father of corruption charges that turned out to be true. He learned
his wizardry mostly by himself, as no teacher wanted an apprentice his age.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He’s the blastier sort of wizard, devoting a large portion of his spell
selection to delivering direct damage. The remainder is split between
self-buffing and non-damaging hostile spells (like <em>grease</em> and <em>obscuring
mist</em>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His preferred weapon is a cane, and at higher levels he carries plenty of
magical jewelry.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Converting Ezren into a <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> character is fairly straightforward:
he’s just a standard human Wizard. His advanced age doesn’t change anything
about his starting stats, and aging rolls aren’t a factor in a <strong>DF</strong> game. It
did give me an excuse to load him up with physical disadvantages that hint at
his frail physique while keeping his mind sharp. His spell selection is actually
pretty close to the original stats, with fire, lightning and acid attack spells,
Shield and Armor for protection, and Grease for control. He also has some nasty
area denial options in the form of Stench and Fire Cloud, as well as a bunch of
more specialized effects that fill out the prerequisites for the more powerful
stuff. His starting power item is his cane, which can be used in combat with the
Smallsword skill in emergencies.</p>

<p>Good advancement options for Ezren are mainly more Magery and spells. Keeping a
character point or two in reserve is a good way to pick up additional spells
mid-delve via Wild Talent, too! While he has a bunch of spells that require
Innate Attack, some players might find it better to replace that skill with
multiple purchases of the Psychic Guidance perk found in <strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 15.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/31/year-in-review.html">2016 in review</a> post I mentioned a GURPS X-COM play-by-forum game
which I unfortunately had to end mid-campaign that year. In this post I’ll talk
about it in more detail, because even though it didn’t reach its conclusion I
think a lot of things about it were great successes. Perhaps this knowledge can
help others, including Future Me when I try something like this again.</p>

<h2 id="the-setting">The Setting</h2>

<p>The setting was 2020 Earth, and the five-year difference was only there to give
me some chronological wiggle room. The original intent was to keep everything as
close to the real world as possible, other than the existence of X-COM and the
alien invaders. In fact, my mapping tool of choice for outdoor action sequences
were Google Maps and Google Earth!</p>

<p>My iteration of X-COM blends influences from several places, as you’ll see
below. The Council responsible for funding it is made up of the 36 nations
described at the end of <a href="http://xcom.wikia.com/wiki/The_Council">this page</a>. Its command and science staff were
NPCs, but I wasn’t entirely under control of who would take which position!</p>

<p>At the start of the campaign, before we even made characters, I gave the players
two choices for the position of Commander and three for the position of Lead
Scientist. They chose a character who was basically a Big Boss expy for
Commander, and an… eccentric Russian scientist named Yuri Sokolov, whose
specialty was in weird science.</p>

<p>The other two scientist choices were Dr. Vahlen and Dr. Shen from the original
game, and they stuck around as prominent NPCs despite not being the official
heads of research. The other Commander choice, a British spy named Smiley, went
into the cold and out of the game.</p>

<p>The players also got a choice of two different alien invasions, and I’ll talk
about them in more detail later.</p>

<h2 id="the-characters">The Characters</h2>

<h3 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h3>

<p>Player characters were built using 250 points, and preferably a GURPS Action
template. There were a few added restrictions. Highly cinematic advantages such
as Gunslinger were off-limits during character creation, tough there would be
opportunities to acquire them in play. Traits whose scope was limited to a
specific area of the world were also disallowed, since this would be a
globe-trotting campaign and they’d almost never come up. These mostly consisted
of social traits such as Contacts or Enemies.</p>

<p>The point total was dictated by their choice of commander, since the two of them
represented different popular strategies in the original games. Mr. Fox (“Big
Boss”) prefers to have a few very competent soldiers with extensive robot
support when that becomes available. Mr. Smiley would have gone with a large
number of relatively expendable soldiers, which would have led to teams of
150-point characters and several NPC redshirts.</p>

<p>The other main variant rule I used was the simplified Guns skills from <strong>Pyramid
#3/65</strong>, which I find a lot simpler to handle than the default spread.</p>

<h3 id="the-pcs">The PCs</h3>

<p>There was a bit of churn in my player and PC roster during the campaign, as is
the nature of forum games, but these characters showed up the most during the
entire run of the game:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kendall Fairbarn</strong>: A paranoid Hacker from the UK. Was completely convinced
human society had been heavily infiltrated by shape-changing aliens… and it
turned out he wasn’t entirely wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Minette Duvall</strong>: A bomb-disposal expert from Southern France, Minette is
also quite handy with a rifle. She’s devoutly Catholic and swears a lot when
faced with danger, which is all the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Niu Yulan (AKA Julia Yulan)</strong>: A former hostage negotiatior from China,
built without a template but approaching a shootier Face. Her innate kindness
and empathy came in handy in several of the missions! Julia was ran by three
different players during the lifetime of the campaign, which earns her a medal
for Most Helpful Backup Character.</li>
  <li><strong>Jack Choi</strong>: A former police detective from Hong Kong, and a staunch
adherent of the “kick down the door” school of policing despite his light
frame. Also built without a template. His player dropped out of the planet
near the end of the game, but not before making things <em>interesting</em> for the
rest of the group.</li>
</ul>

<p>We had others, but they stayed for a shorter time than the four above. Several
actually never saw action as PCs, though Russian Shooter <strong>Vasily Valenkov</strong>
gets another medal for always being there for his teammates even with no player
to run him.</p>

<h3 id="the-organization">The Organization</h3>

<p>X-COM itself was also a character! Between field assignments, players stepped
out of their normal characters for a moment and moved to a “strategy” layer
where they made decisions that affected the organization as a whole. Since I
didn’t want to make this part <em>too</em> complex, it was mostly about deciding what
to research next.</p>

<p>Each strategic phase, the group got a certain number of “research points”
that depended on how well they had done in their previous mission and how
well-favored by the Council X-COM was. They allocated that between several
different research topics, most of which cost a single point at the time the
game stopped. A topic that was fully paid for would bear fruit in the form of
new technology by the time the PCs went on their next deployment.</p>

<h2 id="the-enemy">The Enemy</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, I gave the group a choice of enemy to fight. I wasn’t
very forthcoming with details during this particular part of the vote, of
course, as the whole point of an X-COM game is that the enemy is <em>unknown</em>. The
two were described mostly in terms of what their early signs were: <em>Lights in
the Sky</em> and <em>Noises in the Dark</em>. As you can guess by the title of this post,
the latter’s more mysterious nature won out in the end.</p>

<p>The <em>Lights in the Sky</em> invaders were pretty much the aliens from the original
games, mostly as shown there. I would have introduced some variation, but they
would still have been largely recognizable. I can’t really into more detail, as
this path wasn’t chosen and thus wasn’t developed.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I’m really glad the players chose to go with <em>Noises in the Dark</em>
because this meant I had the opportunity to pit X-COM against
the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/152691/The-Dreams-of-Ruin">Dreams of Ruin</a>.</p>

<p>If you follow that link, you’ll arrive at a DrivethruRPG page for the book of
the same name, which had come out shortly before I started the game. I backed
its Kickstarter, and was dying to use it somewhere. I think this book is
probably the best thing to come out of the OSR, not the least because I don’t
<em>have</em> to use any OSR rules to run it. The good stuff is all system-agnostic and
the rest is relatively easy to convert. Go download it, it’s free!</p>

<p>The best summary I can give about the Dreams is that they are a weaponized
ecosystem that feeds on mundane evil and spreads the cosmic variety wherever it
goes.  Its creators in the book purposefully obscured their identity and simply
let the thing loose in the multiverse, but in this campaign it was being
purposefully deployed as a weapon. Instead of UFOs and sectoids, the PCs get to
deal with evil fungal trees and homicidal puppets.</p>

<p>The identity of the author of the Dreams is left mysterious in the book (unless
you have access to an obscure old edition of Deities &amp; Demigods, I guess), but I
needed slightly more concrete masters here if I wanted this to feel like
X-COM. I eventually settled on something that’s a mix between the original
Ethereals and the devils from the excellent <a href="http://killsixbilliondemons.com/">Kill Six Billion Demons</a>
comic. They were beings of congealed energy whose intellect and personality was
entirely provided by the masks they wore. The ones at the top of the hierarchy
wore black masks, with the progression going black -&gt; gold -&gt; green -&gt; red -&gt;
blue -&gt; white. Other species these Masters had subjugated also had these masks
imposed upon them.</p>

<p>Alien technology was largely based on <em>magic</em> instead of mundane engineering, as
every non-human species in the setting had natural “magic circuits” in their
bodies that could channel mystical energies. They used Ritual Path Magic quite
extensively, with their artifacts being products of enchantment despite looking
like advanced technology. The Dreams produced TL 4+5 gear for their servants,
and the masters of the Dreams used TL4+7 gear.</p>

<p>The PCs never met anyone higher in that hierarchy than a white-mask, aside from
this one rogue blue-masked alien who defected to their side in a mission and
helped with research. X-COM <em>was</em> able to learn the basics of magic before the
game ended, and use some effects in the form of the Technomagic described in
<strong>GURPS Monster Hunters 5: Applied Xenology</strong>.</p>

<p>There was also not one but <em>two</em> extra factions in this war. One was a species
of snake-people from Nilfheim who acted as interdimensional smugglers and drug
dealers - they rode on the tails of the Dreams and preyed upon the worlds they
victimized, disguising themselves as natives. So yes, Kendall was right and
there were reptoid infiltrators everywhere. These took the place of the night
hags from the Dreams of Ruin book.</p>

<p>The other secondary enemy faction was a band of mercenaries and shady operators
run by Mr. Smiley, the commander they rejected at the start. He used funding
from corrupt elites from Council nations who weren’t satisfied with the way that
X-COM failed to cater to their interests and sought an alternative. Yes, this
organization was named X-ALT.</p>

<p>Not all of these aliens have corresponding GURPS stats, since many never
appeared in the actual game, but enough have them that I could make a future
post or two out of them. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2 id="what-went-right">What Went Right</h2>

<p>In Noises in the Dark I put to use several things I learned from previous
attempts at running play-by-forum games, and tried several more. I’m happy to
say several of my riskier experiments were successes!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Giving the players a set of campaign-shaping choices at the start worked
pretty well! It made some of them a little more invested in the setting, and
more importantly gave <em>me</em> a lot of motivation to flesh those choices out once
they were made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The “strategic layer” gimmick worked very well and was a very X-COM
thing. Players cared about the choices they made there and they genuinely
shaped future events.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, the tabletop format allowed for missions that were more
elaborate than was possible in the computer games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Google Maps/Earth as a mapping tool was simply awesome! Players had a <em>very</em>
positive reaction to this one, as did I. It greatly enhanced the missions and
quickly led us to further enhance play by seeking extra real-world information
about the places in question. (“Is this a residential area? Let’s check by
seeing if there are any apartments to rent around there!”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The monsters were suitably spooky, and encounters with them provided great
atmosphere. The group perceived their first Tree of Woe on Halloween (of
2015), which was serendipitous.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-could-be-better-and-why-it-ended">What Could Be Better (and Why It Ended)</h2>

<p>Sadly, not everything was perfect with that game. If it was, it would still be
going! So what didn’t work like I expected?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Overly elaborate fights don’t work so well in a GURPS play-by-forum game. I
usually roll everything myself and resolve up to 3 rounds before posting,
following general directions from the players. That, however, makes some
setups both exhausting to resolve and, I imagine, unsatisfying to read about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The “realness” offered by using Google Maps is a double-edged sword,
especially for this game in particular. The Dreams of Ruin tend to flourish in
sites of great natural or human disaster. The second mission was in such a
place, and it already made me few slightly uneasy. By the end of 2016, I was
no longer willing to mine real-world tragedy for plot hooks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Both of the above factors contributed to sap any energy I had for keeping this
game going. Rather than leaving it entirely unsolved, I ended it officially and
posted all of the spoilers for the players to see. What the items in this
section taught me is to keep fights relatively simple in future games, and not
make them the central focus of the campaign. And to stick to fictional settings
for darker storylines. I’m OK with making <em>analogies</em> to real-world issues in
fictional settings, but outright using them as plots in a game doesn’t sit well
with me.</p>
