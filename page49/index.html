<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The first devil we’re looking at is actually a bad example of infernal
subtlety. Bearded devils, also known as Barbazus, are wrathful creatures who
love to fight. They tend to be used both by their hellish superiors and by
diabolist summoners as bodyguards and shock troops, jobs which suit them just
fine.</p>

<p>Bearded devils are well-armored and fight with glaives enchanted to cause
horrible bleeding wounds. Their beards are actually a mass of muscular clawed
tendrils which they can use to harass enemies. Though they have claws, they will
only use them if they somehow lose their weapons. Barbazus might be fiends but
they still have standards.</p>

<p>Like all devils, they’re Evil and speak Supernal.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Barbazus are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils), and Level 13 Soldiers with 129
HP. They have trained Perception and darkvision, as well as 20 fire
resistance. They run at speed 6.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 glaive, which marks the target for a turn and
causes ongoing 5 damage (save ends) on a hit, in addition to what should be
level-appropriate damage. They also have a claw attack as described above, which
is just a normal physical attack that does less damage than the glaive and
doesn’t mark.</p>

<p>When bloodied they enter a Battle Frenzy, which gives them +2 to attacks and +5
to damage. And their Devilish Teamwork gives adjacent allies a +2 bonus to AC.</p>

<p>Oh, and there’s the beard. Its tendrils act like an Aura 1 around the devil,
dealing an automatic 5 damage to anyone who starts their turn inside.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 13, 3 barbazus and 2 yuan-ti malison sharp-eyes
(i.e., yuan-ti artillery).</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s nothing extraordinary about bearded devil lore, though I find their
looks interesting. Mechanically, they seem to be solid soldiers once you fix
their damage. They use reach weapons, so they work well in two-row formations
with more of their kind, or with brutes.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>We’ve only just spend a whole lot of time looking at demons, and now we’re going
to spend a whole lot of time looking at devils. If you’re new to D&amp;D in general,
you might be wondering what’s the difference between the two types of
monster. Don’t the words “demon” and “devil” mean the same thing? Out here in
the real world they pretty much do, but D&amp;D has a long and storied tradition of
making every synonym of a word into an entirely different monster.</p>

<p>To understand what 4e devils are like, and what makes them different from
demons, I must tell you another story about the World Axis, the cosmology of D&amp;D
4th Edition. This time, it’s about the Astral Sea that exists “above” the world.</p>

<p>Just like the Elemental Chaos combined all the separate elemental planes into
one glorious mess, so does the Astral Sea combine all the former non-elemental
outer planes into a single whole. The old astral plane, which used to be a
featureless gray void, is now a literal sea, and if you look into its silvery
depths you can see the light of the stars in the world’s firmament. By sailing
the Astral Sea you can reach the domains of the gods, which work both like
islands and like worlds in themselves.</p>

<p>Now, there was this one god who had a very powerful exarch named Asmodeus. The
god was pretty nice all in all, but Asmodeus kept thinking that he was too
nice. “Why”, thought Asmodeus, “if I was the big boss here I could do a much
better job. Streamline our processes, leverage our synergies, cut away the
fat”. And so Asmodeus built himself an army out of similarly dissatisfied
servants of this god, and any other astral entity who wanted a piece of the
action.</p>

<p>You might be thinking hey, I heard this one before, and you’d be right. The
difference between the classic Lucifer story and this one, is that <em>here</em> the
rebellion was successful, since the god in question wasn’t omnipotent. He was
still powerful, however. His dying curse twisted the rebel’s bodies into forms
that exposed their inner wickedness. The rebellious angels and exarchs became
devils. The domain of the dead god twisted into itself and became the Nine
Hells. Devils don’t belong in the cosmology the way angels or even evil gods
do. Devils are <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>Still, devils are a lot more “human-ish” in appearance than demons. Most look
like exaggerated versions of tieflings, though technically it’s the tieflings
who look like dilluted versions of devils. Even those devils with a more
monstrous aspect still have a basically humanoid body plan, which is not a
guarantee with demons. Infernal society is militaristic and fiercely
competitive, with individual status being determined by a combination of
official rank and one’s skill at acquiring mortal souls. In other words, devils
compete for promotions by trying to impress their managers with their
outstanding productivity.</p>

<p>Anyway, that “acquiring mortal souls” bit is a big part of the reason for why
devils are <em>wrong</em>. Lots of people here in the real world say that when you’re
evil in live you go to Hell after death, but that’s not how it works in the
World Axis. Evil people who die here likely go to the realm of the evil god
whose credo more closely matches their ethics. To get souls, devils have to go
out and steal them. Each soul stolen by Hell diminishes the power of the gods,
and adds to that of the devils. The general idea seem to be that removing enough
souls from the hands of the gods will weaken then and allow devils to take over.</p>

<p>So even evil gods would have cause to oppose devils, though it turns out several
of them (Bane, Gruumsh, Tiamat, Torog and Vecna) are on more or less friendly
terms with Hell because they struck deals with Asmodeus in the distant
past. Either they believe themselves safe, or think they can outsmart Asmodeus
when it’s time for the backstabbing. What actually happens when that time comes
is left as an exercise for the GM. Asmodeus is pretty smart, but so are Vecna
and Tiamat.</p>

<p>Devils have all kinds of uses for souls, from playthings to currency to raw
material for their mightiest inventions and magics. Their methods of acquisition
are many, with the most popular ones being infernal bargains and other types of
trickery. Given all of the above I imagine they don’t necessarily try to make
you become evil, just to sign the contract.</p>

<p>However, violence is not off the table as a means of soul acquisition. This puts
a new spin on “kill them and take their stuff”. When devils fight, they do so in
a distinctly different way from demons, and their stats bear this out. Demons
are elites more often than not, and tend to fight as mobs of individuals with
their assorted sharp appendages. In contrast to this, even higher-level devils
are usually regulars, fight with well-crafted weapons, and rely a lot more on
teamwork and training.</p>

<p>Asmodeus, now a god, rules all devils from Nessus, the deepest of the Nine
Hells. Each of his exarchs rules one of the other eight layers, and while
they’re a little less popular than the demon lords, their names are still
classics: Mammon, Belial, Belzebub, and so on.</p>

<p>I’m not sure these archdevils are statted in any of the monster books; these
entries are for their less powerful underlings. We’ll see them starting next
post, using the same order I did with demons: we’ll look at the devils from the
MM, and their MV counterparts when they appear. This time it appears that all of
the devils that made it into the MV also exist on the MM.</p>

<p>All of the devils here seem to have two names. One is just an adjective followed
by the word “Devil”, the other something more exotic sounding. Since they’re
listed in the Monster Manual’s table of contents by their more prosaic names,
I’ll use those as titles, but I’ll also mention the fancier name in each
article.</p>

<p>The first non-demonic monster we’re going to look at in ages is the
Destrachan. These aberrant dinosaur things first showed up in the Monster Manual
2 for D&amp;D 3.0, if I’m not mistaken. So, in a way, they’re being promoted. They
appear only on the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Destrachans are blind sapient predators, roaming dungeons and other underground
locations guided by their non-visual senses. When they find something they think
they can eat, they kill it dead using bone-shattering bursts of sound. They can
learn to mimic sounds they hear often, and will use those to help disguise their
approach, which explains why they’re trained in Bluff. I wonder how common it is
for a destrachan to mimic the voice of a dying adventurer asking for help.</p>

<p>These creatures have an affinity for other aberrant monsters, and will often
team up with them. They’ll also often ally with other underground dwellers and
monstrous humanoids such as drow, grimlocks, medusas, trolls… It’s a good bet
Eberron’s Droaam has its share of destrachan citizens (if they’re not all
daelkyr cultists instead).</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two varieties of Destrachan here, both Large Aberrant Magical Beasts
(blind). They’re also both Evil.</p>

<p>The standard <strong>Destrachan</strong> is Level 9 Artillery with 80 HP. It has blindsight
10, is immune to gaze attacks and has Resist Thunder 10. It has a ground speed
of 6 and a climb speed of 3, so this is yet another Underdark monster who can
drop on you from the ceiling.</p>

<p>Its basic melee attack is a weak Reach 1 claw, and its main attack is a Range 10
Sound Pulse that targets Reflex and does thunder damage. It can also go louder
and use a Bellowing Blast quite often (recharge 3-6). This targets Fortitude in
a Close Blast 5, does the same thunder damage as the pulse, and dazes (save
ends).</p>

<p>The monster prefers to stay far away and attack with sound pulses, but it has no
reason to not spam Bellowing Blast as often as possible if the PCs manage to
close in.</p>

<p>The <strong>Destrachan Far Voice</strong> is a smarter (Int 10 instead of 7) and stronger
variant. It’s Level 15 Artillery with 122 HP. Its blindsight increases to 20,
its thunder resistance to 15, and its speed to 8 (climb 4).</p>

<p>It has the same attacks as the classic model, adjusted for the level-up, and a
new encounter power named Reverberate. It targets the fortitude of everyone in a
Close Burst 2, does a smidge more thunder damage than the Bellowing Blast, and
<em>stuns</em> (save ends). On a miss, it still does half damage and dazes for a turn.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>The entry has two.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 9: 2 destrachans and a trio of assorted foulspawn form an all-aberrant
monster team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 1 destrachan far voice, 2 driders, and a trio of assorted drow.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Destrachans are another of those weird monsters who kinda come out of left
field, but I think their 4e versions at least have a clear mechanical
role. Their propensity to ally with other creatures gives you an excellent
excuse to add some convenient ranged support to monster teams that would
otherwise lack it.</p>

<p>Dretches are the pond scum of the Abyss. The name “dretch” is likely a
contraction of “demon wretch”, because these things are weak, stupid and
stinky. Everyone bullies them back home, and more powerful demons love throwing
hordes of dretches at new opposition both to gauge their abilities and to enjoy
the sight of dretches dying in droves.</p>

<p>I think dretches used to be the souls of Chaotic Evil sinners in previous
editions, but that is not the case here. Demons in 4e don’t care about souls,
and no one who dies goes to the Abyss. These balls of rage and body odor just
spontaneously generate from the corruption of that plane.</p>

<p>In this edition, Dretches first show up in the Monster Manual 2, so we’re
getting a bit ahead of ourselves here. This is because they’re also present in
the Monster Vault. Since we have the space we’ll cover the MM2 and MV versions
each in their own entry.</p>

<p>In both cases, they’re Small Elemental Humanoids (demons) with Int 5 and
darkvision. They speak Abyssal but have nothing interesting to say.</p>

<h2 id="dretch-mm2">Dretch (MM2)</h2>

<p>Basic dretches are Level 2 Brutes with 44 HP, which very likely makes them the
first demon your PCs will ever encounter in a Heroic campaign. They possess the
usual variable resistance 10 (1/encounter). A Sickening Miasma emanates from
their bodies in an Aura 1 pattern. Each enemy inside the aura takes 1 damage
whenever they take a move or standard action. Multiple miasma auras are
cumulative, increasing that damage to a maximum of 5. Beware dretch mobs!</p>

<p>Their basic attack uses their claws, and they can also make an at-will Claw
Frenzy that allows them to make that attack against up to two creatures. The
Monster Manual 2 still had the damage bug, but these monsters are too low-level
to be much affected by it.</p>

<p>When a dretch dies it spills its stinky insides all over the floor. This Vile
Death creates a zone of poison on a Close Burst 1 pattern centered on the
dretch, which lasts for a turn and does 5 poison damage to any non-demons who
enter it or start their turns inside.</p>

<p>Do note that while the Vile Death deals poison damage, the Sickening Miasma
deals <em>untyped</em> damage. Being resistent to poison will not save you from dretch
funk.</p>

<p>The sample encounter in the MM2 is level 7! 1 level 7 bloodseep demon, 2 level 5
gnaw demons, and <em>eight</em> dretches. Whoever designed this really took that line
about waves of dretches in the lore seriously.</p>

<h2 id="dretch-lackey-mv">Dretch Lackey (MV)</h2>

<p>Monster Vault demons are strictly paragon tier or above, so it gives us the
Dretch Lackey, a Level 12 Minion Brute.</p>

<p>They lack the MM2’s dretch Vile Death and multiattack ability, but the attack
bonus and damage on their claws is appropriate for fighting early Paragon
PCs. They do keep the Sickening Miasma, which now does 2 untyped damage per
dretch up to a maximum of 10.</p>

<p>Having a huge crowd of Dretch Lackeys seems more appropriate than the
medium-large crowd of basic dretches from the MM2’s sample encounter.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>I guess I can kinda see why dretches were left out of the first Monster
Manual. Sure, they’re the classic low-level demons, but they don’t have much
more than tradition going for them. Still, the pull of tradition might be
enough - I did wonder where they were when I first looked at the MM entries.</p>

<p>In fourth edition, the Babau first appears on the Monster Manual 3. We’re
viewing them ahead of time because they also appear on the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The general thrust of demons in 4e is that they’re not fond of complex schemes,
which are more of a devil thing. Babaus are one of the exceptions to that
rule. You see, there’s this demon lord called Graz’zt who is not a former
primordial like the other demon lords. Instead, he was an archdevil who got it
into his mind to invade the Abyss. Why did he do that? I don’t know. The lore in
the MM3 mentions the Blood War, but I didn’t think that was still a thing in
this edition. Maybe it’s a vestige of his backstory from Planescape, or maybe
the Blood War has a different explanation for its existence here.</p>

<p>Anyway, shortly after getting to the Abyss, Graz’zt was corrupted by the seed of
evil and decided to stay around and become a demon lord. Glasya, another
archdevil and daughter of Asmodeus, was not pleased by that. She went after him
and ran him through with her sword. When the drops of blood from that wound hit
the ground of the Abyss, they became babaus, and their number was so great they
drove Glasya back to the Hells, and their continued presence helped build
Graz’zt’s power base and make his claim to demon lordship stick.</p>

<p>Being the spawn of Graz’zt, babaus are extraordinarily subtle and cunning for
demons. This means they like to kidnap people to torture later instead of
killing them all right away. They can be found working alongside other demons,
even though they’re even less trusted than usual due to their continuing loyalty
to their creator.</p>

<p>They look like skeletally thin humanoids with dark gray skin coated in slime, a
spine-like tail, and a weird horn that looks like a scorpion stinger growing out
of the back of their heads. All of this in addition to the usual demonic claws
and fangs.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Since the babau is from the Monster Manual 3, its stats are identical in that
book and in the Monster Vault. It’s a Medium Elemental Humanoid (demon), and a
Level 13 Skirmisher with 127 HP. They run with Speed 7.</p>

<p>The babau has acid resistance 5, plus variable resistance 20 usable
2/encounter. It’s coated in acidic slime that deals 5 acid damage to anyone who
attacks it with a melee attack.</p>

<p>This demon has two basic attacks, a bite and a claw. It can only use one of them
per standard action, unless the target is granting combat advantage. Then it can
use both. Each attack only does about half the level-appropriate damage for a
skirmisher by itself, so the babau should really strive to gain combat advantage
when fighting. The bite also does 5 ongoing acid damage, or 10 if the demon is
bloodied.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the babau can perform a Murderous Abduction. This teleports
an adjacent creature up to 7 squares and then immediately teleports the babau
next to it. The victim grants combat advantage to the babau for a turn. This
recharges whenever the babau drops someone to 0 HP. I’m guessing it reserves the
power for then a PC is close to dropping.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m gonna have to go with “meh” on this one. Their backstory feels kinda
shoehorned in. They somehow brought back the Blood War and Graz’zt, both of
which I feel are completely unnecessary.</p>

<p>As for the babaus themselves, they seem a bit too hard to use properly, since
they absolutely must gain combat advantage to do level-appropriate damage with
their attacks. The abduction power makes it seem that they’d be best employed in
terrain with obstacles that are hard to overcome without teleportation, but then
they can’t teleport back even if they drop the abducted PC. And if the PC
doesn’t fall on that first turn, then the demon is now stranded far from its own
allies and together with an angry PC.</p>
