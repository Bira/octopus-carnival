<p>For a lot of players, a big part of the fun of playing in the Dungeon Fantasy
genre comes from the rewards their characters acquire in play. And these in
turn fall into two main categories: treasure and experience.</p>

<p>In GURPS, “experience” means Character Points, which are usually obtained for
successfully completing adventure goals and can be directly used to improve
characters. “Treasure” in a Dungeon Fantasy context can be split into magic
items and “monetary” treasure (i.e, coins and stuff you end up selling in town).</p>

<p>By default these two reward types are mostly unrelated. Going by the experience
rewards scheme on p. 92 of DF: Exploits, a party could enter a dungeon, win lots
of battles, find a secret area or three, and win plenty of experience even if
they never find a single coin’s worth of treasure.</p>

<p>Depending on the exact nature of your campaign, you might want to mess with
this reward scheme. Here are two possible ways to do that. In both, magic items
remain pretty much as written, but a stronger relationship is established
between experience and monetary treasure. They replace the standard system from
DF: Exploits entirely.</p>

<h2 id="old-school-money-is-experience">Old School: Money Is Experience</h2>

<p>When the party returns to town, add up the total value in $ of all the monetary
treasure they acquired. As usual, coins contribute their full value. Other items
contribute their sale value, but only if the PCs sell them. Those items they
decide to keep should be excluded from this calculation.</p>

<p>This total should be divided among the PCs. If your party is an anarchist
commune that keeps all money in a collective pile (like mine are!), then assume
an equal split for experience purposes. Most other parties probably also split
their take evenly, though if they’re really into that old-school vibe they might
have a complicated scheme set up that includes henchmen with half-shares,
seniority bonuses, and thieves who steal from the other PCs.</p>

<p>The PCs who survived the process of splitting the loot get to earn XP from
it. Divide each PC’s share by $500: that’s how many points they get. This is the
exact same exchange rate they’d get from converting character points to money
during character creation. Depending on how much treasure your adventures
feature, you might want to adjust the rate! For example, a PC in a campaign that
follows <a href="https://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com/2020/05/nearly-complete-thoughts-on-10x-cost.html">Petter V. Del’Orto’s suggested house rule</a> would earn one point for
every $5000 they earned.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Let’s say we have a party of 5 PCs that agree to split their loot
evenly. They meet a dragon shortly after they enter a dungeon, and are forced to
retreat having only found a small coin stash worth $1500. That comes out to $300
per PC, which is not enough for them to earn any points from this delve.</p>

<p>The PCs prepare themselves better and try again, and this time they’re able to
kill the dragon and loot its hoard, which contains $25000 in monetary treasure
and several magic items. The magic items don’t enter into this calculation, so
each PC ends up with $5000 and earns 10 character points from it.</p>

<h2 id="dungeon-souls-experience-is-money">Dungeon Souls: Experience is Money</h2>

<p>Some campaigns take place in settings where money is worthless. One example is
the Havens and Hells setting presented in Pyramid #3/89. Another is the Dark
Souls franchise. This alternate system is inspired by the latter, taking the
usual “battle experience” mechanics and making them into an in-character
concept.</p>

<p>The metaphysics of the world are such that when you defeat a monster in battle,
you siphon off a little of its life force! Depending on the setting this might
require killing the monster, but it could also involve simply defeating it in
combat and performing a small ritual.</p>

<p>In either case, people in the setting can use this accumulated “soul energy” for
all sorts of purposes, and it can be voluntarily transferred. So it becomes the
de-facto currency in a setting that has no use for mundane money.</p>

<p>The simplest way to implement this is to say that victory in battle is worth 500
“soul points” for every character point it would have been worth according to
p. 92 of DF: Exploits. This means a battle against a small amount of fodder is
worth nothing, and a big boss fight with lots of extra henchthings thrown in
might be worth 1500 SP. Again, this is the same exchange rate you use to convert
points into money during character creation, and you can vary it to suit your
preferred pace of advancement.</p>

<p>A more detailed way to model it is to use the optional rules on the <strong>It’s a
Threat!</strong> article on Pyramid #3/77, and say that a slain monster is worth soul
points equal to its Combat Effectiveness Rating. This method is a bit
math-intensive: the article has a table with values for a few published
monsters, but for anything outside of that you’ll have to calculate it.</p>

<p>No matter which method you’re using, an important decision you must make is
whether the “soul points” from a battle must be split among the PCs or if each
PC gets the full amount when the fight ends. The former setup results in much
slower advancement than the system in Exploits, while the latter more or less
keeps pace with it as far as combat experience is concerned. I do <em>not</em>
recommend fully copying Dark Souls and giving soul points from a monster only to
the PC who dealt the last blow: that works in a solo campaign, but nowhere else.</p>

<p>“Treasure” might still exist in this model in the form of dead adventurers with
residual soul points still present in their remains. This could lead to
entertaining scenes such as the party slaying a dragon and leaving its piles of
gold behind in favor of searching for the corpses of the previous parties that
failed to defeat it. And of course, if you’re using Havens and Hells then
Souls-like corpse runs are totally a thing that happens in that setting.</p>

<p>Using soul points for advancement is a matter of converting them in town using
the reverse exchange rate: 500 SP for 1 character point. They can also be used
to buy stuff, in which case 1 SP is worth $1. So characters must choose between
buying equipment or upgrading their abilities, which will end up slowing
advancement overall and making looted gear that much more desirable. A suit of
fine armor you find in the wild is one you don’t have to spend Soul Points on!</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>D&amp;D has historically featured a whole bunch of dog-like monsters in its
bestiaries, and Fourth Edition is no different. This Monster Manual entry
collects a bunch of them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The monsters in these entries are basically large dogs with various supernatural
powers, so you already have a good idea of what they look like and what they’re
used for: pets, guard animals, trackers, and so on.</p>

<p>In the implied Fourth Edition setting, mundane dogs kind of compete with drakes
in the roles I mentioned above. The supernatural powers of these monstrous
hounds make them more powerful than a typical drake, though.</p>

<p>First we have Hell Hounds, who have the ability to both resist and breathe
fire. Despite the name, they originate in the Elemental Chaos, being one of the
early creations of the primordials. Fire giants have been breeding hellhounds
for millennia, and their efforts result in larger and more powerful specimens
than can be found in the wild or in the service of less experienced breeders.</p>

<p>Next we have Shadow Hounds, native to the Shadowfell and embodying many of the
real-world myths of spooky black dogs that foretell your death or simply attack
you while you’re out in the moors.</p>

<p>And finally, we have the Hounds of the Wild Hunt, the favorite pets of those
epic-tier Eladrin and fey nobles. Their vigor is boundless, their strength
unmatched, and their intelligence super-canine.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Though the doggies in this entry are quite diverse, they do have a couple of
traits in common. They’re Medium Beasts, they generally run fast, and they have
trained Perception. Everything else varies.</p>

<h3 id="hell-hound">Hell Hound</h3>

<p>Hell hounds are Medium Elemental Beasts (fire), and Level 7 Brutes with 96
HP. They have Resist 20 Fire, run at speed 7, and are surrounded by a fiery aura
1 that does a bit of fire damage to anyone caught inside.</p>

<p>Their main attack is a bite that does a mix of physical and fire damage, and
they can also breathe fire (Close Blast 3 vs. Reflex, recharge 4-6).</p>

<p>Simple and direct creatures, you only need to fix their damage before adding
them to your game. A pack of hell hounds doesn’t need to worry about friendly
fire if they surround the PCs, and they can pair well with ranged monsters or
with other fire-resistant frontliners.</p>

<h3 id="firebred-hell-hound">Firebred Hell Hound</h3>

<p>The variety bred by fire giants is also a Medium Elemental Beast (fire), but
it’s considerably stronger: a Level 17 Brute with 205 HP. The fiery aura does a
bit more damage, its fire resistance is 40, and its ground speed 8.</p>

<p>Firebred hell hounds have the same attacks as the basic model, plus a Fiery
Burst (Close Burst 3 vs. Reflex, recharge 6) that gives then more options for
dealing area-effect fire damage.</p>

<h3 id="shadow-hound">Shadow Hound</h3>

<p>These are Medium Shadow Beasts, and Level 6 Skirmishers with 70 HP. They run at
speed 7, and have a teleport speed of 7 as well. They’re surrounded by a Shroud
of Night (aura 5) that makes all light within one step darker, and have
Vulnerable 5 Radiant. Obviously, they also have darkvision.</p>

<p>The shadow hound’s basic attack is a bite, which does extra sneak attack damage
and combat advantage if used right after the monster teleports adjacent to its
target. They can bay as a minor action (Close Burst 5 vs. Will; Fear,
sound-based; recharge 5-6) to inflict a -2 penalty to all defenses of anyone
they affect, lasting for a turn.</p>

<p>In combat they’ll keep bouncing between PCs, to get that sneak attack damage,
and will bay whenever possible to keep their defenses lowered.</p>

<h3 id="wild-hunt-hound">Wild Hunt Hound</h3>

<p>These good boys are Medium Fey Beasts, and Level 21 Skirmishers with 205
HP. They have low-light vision, speed 10 on the ground and in the air, and their
Menacing Growling acts as an Aura 10 that inflicts a -2 defense penalty to all
enemies within.</p>

<p>These hounds also get +2 defense against opportunity attacks, and cause extra
“sneak attack” damage when they have combat advantage. Their bite does even more
bonus physical damage against immobilized targets. The first time they hit, the
target is also slowed and prevented from teleporting; the next hit after that
will immobilize instead. A save can end these conditions.</p>

<p>Finally, Wild Hunt Hounds can execute a Mobile Melee Attack at will, moving 5
squares without provoking opportunity attacks and biting someone at any point
along the movement.</p>

<p>These things are terrifying when accompanied by a band of epic-level wild
hunters (like the Ghaele of Winter or equivalent fey).</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Each hound type gets a sample encounter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 2 shadow hounds, 2 shadar-kai gloomblades, 1 shadar-kai witch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 2 firebred hellhounds, 2 azer beastlords, 1 azer taskmaster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 20: 4 wild hunt hounds, 1 bralani of autumn wilds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hell hounds are a classic, and I like that they took some strong mythical
figures for the other entries. Despite the usual damage bugs the stat blocks
themselves also seem fairly simple and effective in a fight.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Horses are a real-world animal, so you likely have a good idea of what they’re
like. They’ve been in the game since the very beginning, and here they have
their own entry in the MM and are part of the animal appendix on the MV.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>They’re horses! Herbivore ungulates widely used as mounts and beasts of burden
by any society that managed to develop animal domestication. You can still find
wild herds running through the plains of the world and the Feywild, but most
horses the PCs are likely to meet in their adventures will be acting as
someone’s mount.</p>

<p>Unlike in the real world, horses are far from the only choice of mount for your
typical D&amp;D society. There are plenty of other, more fantastic beasts that can
do the job just as well. If that job is “war mount”, they can likely do it
better. Yeah, warhorses are still a thing here, but the same amount of work that
goes into training one can instead get you a dire boar, hippogriff, or some kind
of drake. I think this is the first setting I see where a warhorse is the animal
you ride into combat when nothing better is available.</p>

<p>There’s a breed of horse that’s a potential exception to this: the celestial
charger, which is infused with divine energy and typically used as mounts only
by noble warriors and champions of justice. A Paladin PC might get one of these
as a reward for service to their kingdom, for example. They’re much more
powerful and intelligent than a typical horse, though they’re still animals.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Horses are Large Natural Beasts with the Mount keyword. They have low-light
vision, trained Perception and high ground speeds. We get three different stat
blocks.</p>

<h3 id="riding-horse-mm">Riding Horse (MM)</h3>

<p>These are meant for transportation, not battle, and are as close to a
non-combatant as you can be while still having a stat block. They’re here
because they’re likely to be the first rides your PCs get in their adventuring
careers.</p>

<p>They’re Level 1 Brutes with 36 HP and can run at speed 10. Their usual strategy
when in combat is to run away! Their only attack is a basic Kick they’ll only
employ when trapped or startled. The only reason these aren’t minions it’s
because have your horse one-shotted out from under you is no fun.</p>

<h3 id="warhorse-mm">Warhorse (MM)</h3>

<p>A larger, stronger horse trained to be ridden into combat and fight alongside
its rider.</p>

<p>It’s a Level 3 Brute with 58 HP and a ground speed of 8. Its basic attack is
still a Kick, but it can also Trample. We saw this one before: it allows the
warhorse to move its speed, go through enemy spaces (while drawing opportunity
attacks) and make an attack against any enemy whose space it crosses. This
attack is a bit stronger than the kick, and knocks prone on a hit.</p>

<p>Warhorses also have a Charger passive trait, which gives their riders a +5
damage bonus on charges.</p>

<h3 id="horse-mv">Horse (MV)</h3>

<p>The “generic” horse in the MV animal appendix is actually an updated
warhorse despite being a Level 1 Brute with 36 HP. The damage of its attacks has
been fixed, so they’re actually stronger than the MM warhorse’s despite the
lower level. The Charger trait is still here, though it only gives a +3 damage
bonus in this version.</p>

<h3 id="celestial-charger-mm">Celestial Charger (MM)</h3>

<p>Celestial Chargers are Large Immortal Beasts with the Mount keyword, instead of
being Natural like other horses. They’re Level 10 Soldiers with 111 HP, a +5
bonus to saves against fear, and Speed 8.</p>

<p>Celestial chargers kick and trample like warhorses, though their damage could
use a serious boost. They have two supernatural passive traits: Zephyr Footing
allows them to ignore all difficult terrain and move across any solid or liquid
surface; and Celestial Charge gives a +2d6 radiant damage bonus to their rider’s
charges.</p>

<p>I think these might be like the magic horses from Krull, or Gandalf’s Shadowfax.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>No sample encounters here, but as I said almost any sapient humanoid could be
found riding horses.</p>

<p>I would normally say you gotta have horses in your medieval-ish setting, but
we’ve seen so many other awesome mounts already that I think they might actually
be somewhat redundant. A setting with no horses but all sorts of other mounts
might look a bit like Final Fantasy. A few other possibilities present
themselves as well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The setting has no horses and everyone uses other mounts, but then it gets
invaded by an interdimensional army and the invaders use horses, which would
make <em>them</em> the exotic and alien mount.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The setting has no <em>mundane</em> horses, but one or more gods send celestial
chargers to their chosen champions as a sign of their favor. They’re seen as
this powerful divine beast without an eartlhy equivalent, in another neat role
inversion.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hook horrors definitely look like something that’s been around since AD&amp;D. My
first contact with them was in Neverwinter Nights, which used a model for them
that was nearly identical to that of vrock demons. The chunky fellow above is
quite different from those and much easier to tell apart. They’re only on the
MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Hook horrors are yet another example of predatory Underdark wildlife, adapted to
hunt in total darkness by clinging to a cave ceiling and dropping on its
victims. Unlike a lot of other Underdark wildlife we’ve seen so far, they’re
Natural, not Aberrant, which means they evolved down there on their own instead
of immigrating from the Far Realm.</p>

<p>Hook horrors are omnivorous, but prefer meat and are rumored to like drow meat
more than other kinds. They live in total darkness and use echolocation to
perceive their surroundings, though they have functional eyes to see in brighter
environments. The clicking noises they make are also used for communication, and
smart explorers can listen for those to see if hook horrors are nearby.</p>

<p>A group of hook horrors is called a “clan”, and is led by its strongest
egg-laying female. It ranges widely in the Underdark, with its members forming
smaller packs to hunt. Drow tend to kill adult hook horrors on sight and steal
their eggs to raise the hatchlings as attack animals.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>There’s only one stat block, so we’ll get right on it. Hook Horrors are Large
Natural Beasts, and Level 13 Soldiers with 137 HP. They have Blindsight 10 to
represent their echolocation, and a relatively slow ground speed 4. They can
also climb at speed 4.</p>

<p>Their basic attack uses those hooked forelimbs, dealing damage and pulling the
target 1 square on a hit. They can choose to attack twice at a -2 penalty to
each attack, and if both hit they deal some extra damage and grab the target
until escape. They can keep making hook attacks against grabbed victims, and can
also bite them as a minor action (which does slightly less damage).</p>

<p>They can also use their hooks to Fling a target. The book doesn’t say whether
this only works on a grabbed target or on anyone. It’s an attack vs. Fortitude
that rercharges on a 6, does more damage than the basic hook attack, slides the
target 3 squares, and knocks them prone.</p>

<p>I imagine you can make different hook horrors by giving them the same blindsight
as this one and a few hook-based attacks that do different things.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13, a balhannoth and 3 hook horrors. Looks like the ninja slug is
opportunistically following the horrors around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13, a hook horror, 2 grimlock berserkers and 1 beholder eye of
flame. A beholder and its retinue.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m indifferent to hook horrors. I suppose a large variety of Underdark
predators is good, but since they all fulfill more or less the same dramatic
role they tend to leave me cold.</p>

<p>I think Homunculi are derived from a medieval alchemy concept, and I’m pretty
sure they’ve been in the game since AD&amp;D. Here they appear only in the Monster
Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In my post on Helmed Horrors I compared construct creators to real-world
programmers. Let’s stretch the analogy a bit further: if golems and greater
helmed horrors are big packages of enterprise software, then homunculi are shell
scripts.</p>

<p>These minor constructs are built for the exact same purposes as their beefier
relatives: to act as tireless guardians, servants, and muscle. Being low-level,
I imagine they’re a lot easier to create, and their programming includes some
“shortcuts” that make them particularly adept at a specific kind of guard job.</p>

<p>Mentally, they’re pretty much like golems: they can understand even complex
instructions from their masters perfectly, and execute them without much thought
of self-preservation unless specifically ordered to avoid taking damage. Unlike
golems, though, ownership of an homunculus can be transferred to someone else
with a simple order (“this person is your master now”). This means they’ll often
be found in the service of someone who isn’t their creator.</p>

<p>So a low-level aspiring golem maker can have homunculi as servants, and
higher-level casters who would use actual golems as personal guards can
mass-produce homunculi and assign them to their underlings. The relative
weakness of an homunculus is actually an asset here! If those pesky organic
underlings start getting rebelious ideas, your personal guard-bot can easily
squash them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three quite diverse stat blocks here. They’re all Natural Animates with
the Construct and Homunculus keywords, training in Perception, darkvision, and
immunity to disease and poison. Everything else is variable.</p>

<p>Different types of homunculus gain special bonuses when tasked to guard a
person, object or area. For rules purposes, objects can weight up to 50 pounds
and areas can be up to 5 squares on a side. We’ll see why in a minute.</p>

<h3 id="clay-scout">Clay Scout</h3>

<p>This Small homunculus is probably the one closest to the classic myth. It’s used
for, well, scouting, or for guarding small objects. I imagine it makes an
adequate menial lab assistant if well-managed.</p>

<p>Clay scouts are Level 2 Lurkers with 31 HP and all common homunculus
traits. They’re also trained in Stealth, and can run at speed 6 or fly at speed
3 (clumsy).</p>

<p>Scouts attack with a weak venomous bite that allows a secondary attack against
Fortitude, which slows on a hit (save ends). They can attack at range using a
Mind Touch (Ranged 10 vs. Will) which does adequate psychic damage and dazes
(save ends). Mind Touch is clearly their main attack, with the bite being more
of an emergency measure.</p>

<p>When targeted by a melee or ranged attack, they can use Redirect as an
interrupt. This target’s the attackers Will, and on a success forces them to
redirect their attack to an adjacent creature of the homunculus’ choice. Tricky!</p>

<p>They cap things off with a couple of interesting passive traits: clay scouts are
invisible to dazed creatures and, if tasked to guard an object, gain a +4 to
attack anyone adjacent to or carrying that object.</p>

<p>I think they’d mostly use their attacks to prevent pursuit in case they’re
discovered spying on you. They’re big enough to carry most objects they could be
set to guard, too. This is the construct you use when you want to carry
something to the ends of the earth so it’s never found again.</p>

<h3 id="iron-defender">Iron Defender</h3>

<p>A metal guard dog, for when drakes aren’t enough but you don’t have the budget
for a shield guardian. It’s a Level 3 Soldier with 47 HP and all common
homunculus traits. It runs with speed 6.</p>

<p>It attacks by biting, and if tasked to guard a creature it can bite anyone who
attacks that creature as a reaction. It can also shift 1 square before or after
making opportunity attacks.</p>

<h3 id="iron-cobra">Iron Cobra</h3>

<p>An homunculus named for its shape, not its role. As far as homunculi go, this is
a high-end model.</p>

<p>It’s a Level 6 Skirmisher with 75 HP and all common homunculus traits. It
slithers with speed 7, and can shift 3 squares as a move action.</p>

<p>They attack with a venomous bite that also does 5 ongoing poison damage (save
ends), and it can poison its enemies’ minds as well.</p>

<p>Poison the Mind (Ranged 10 vs. Will; recharge 3-6) is an attack that can only
target creatures suffering ongoing poison damage. The cobra’s bite is an obvious
source of this, but if other venomous creatures are part of the same encounter
their attacks also count. A hit dazes and slows the target (save ends).</p>

<p>When set to guard an area, iron cobras can use Poison the Mind without
restriction against any creature inside that area. This means the attack
effectively becomes at-will, and can target anyone in the area even if they
aren’t taking poison damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 9: 2 iron cobras, 2 snaketongue warriors, and 1
snaketongue assassin. As expected, iron cobras are a hit with snake fanatics
everywhere!</p>

<p>I think homunculi fulfill a necessary role for GMs who want to pit their PCs
against constructs from an early point in the campaing. As we’ve seen already,
golems and other similar constructs are usually too powerful to be fought by
early-heroic tier characters.</p>

<p>I also like that their existence allows for that “construct-making as a parody
of the tech industry” setting element I’ve been thinking about.</p>
