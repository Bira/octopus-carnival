<p>Welcome back to Let’s Read Hell’s Rebels! This post will cover Part 2 of the
second adventure, Turn of the Torrent. <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/07/hells-rebels-2-part-1.html">Part 1</a> had the PCs meet with former
Torrent Hellknight Octavio Sabinus, who promised to join the Silver Ravens
should the PCs rescue his knights from the Old Kintargo Holding House.</p>

<p>Part 2 covers that rescue mission and several other events that happen in the
neighborhood of Old Kintargo. According to the book, its inhabitants are both
the most distrustful of outsiders and the most likely to join the rebellion when
properly inspired, since they have a long tradition of defying Chelish rule in
small ways.</p>

<p>Like in the first adventure, the missions are numbered but can be completed in
any order.</p>

<h2 id="but-first-some-setup">But First, Some Setup</h2>

<p>In a remarkable display of slavish adherence to its adventure outline template,
the book literally ends its Part 1 while the party is mid-conversation with
Octavio Sabinus. You then need to go through two pages of background info and
optional events in the Part 2 before returning to the details of what Sabinus
wants the PCs to do. While the scene on Part 1 does include a page reference
to these details, it’s still a bit of an awkward read.</p>

<p>Anyway, Part 2 begins by recommending that the PCs make the Tooth and Nail
tavern a temporary staging area, since all its events happen in the same
neighborhood. It describes some tavern games that are common there, as well as
an NPC they can meet who is actually Part 3’s main villain in disguise.</p>

<p>Then it describes Proclamation the Tenth, where The Barzilai outlaws the works
of several poets and writers whose works mock House Thrune. Three of them are
long dead, but one is “The Poison Pen of Kintargo”, an NPC who will become
relevant in Mission 2. If one of the PCs is also a poet or writer, their name
should also be on this list, which is the bit I found really interesting.</p>

<h2 id="optional-encounter-being-followed">Optional Encounter: Being Followed</h2>

<p>This optional encounter is where Thrune hires a mercenary detective to follow
the PCs around and report on their movements. Tayacet Tiora is the sort who
claims to ignore politics in favor of getting the job done, but the book says
she will slowly come to realize Barzilai is bad business all around in future
adventures. Any encounters the PCs might have with her here are stated to be
mere foreshadowing for her appearance in future adventures, and she could be
left out entirely.</p>

<p>That’s likely for the best, to be honest. Tiora might look cool, but the PCs
won’t take kindly to being followed by an agent of the enemy and will be even
more frustrated when she makes her scripted escape.</p>

<h2 id="mission-1-rescue-at-the-holding-house">Mission 1: Rescue at the Holding House</h2>

<p>And here we are, picking up on the Octavio conversation as if the intervening
pages didn’t exist.</p>

<p>When discussing the details of this mission, Octavio Sabinus will give them his
prized mithral short sword, explaining it belonged to his mother. Showing the
sword to his knights and repeating that bit of info should serve as proof of the
PC’s allegiance, and help secure their cooperation. The sword itself should also
be useful against any devils they run into.</p>

<p>The Holding House is not the most secure prison in the city, but it’s still
locked down pretty tight. While the adventure describes the place in sufficient
detail for the PCs to make a frontal assault or attempt a sneaking mission,
Octavio’s suggestion of showing up with forged prisoner transfer documents is
the plan with the biggest chance of success here.</p>

<p>The book lists the requirements for forging the papers, and details an NPC
forger the group can hire if none of them are very skilled at it. Opposition
here consists of a total of eight dottari guards with the same stats as the one
encountered in Part 1, plus their slightly weird commander Warden Sabo. More
guards will show up at regular intervals if a fight breaks out.</p>

<p>Good forgeries and some fast-talking should get them past all of these people
and into the cells, which contain three of the four knights they’re supposed to
rescue. The fourth is currently being tortured by the scalpel devil.</p>

<p>Oh, I didn’t mention the scalpel devil? It’s like a chain devil, but covered in
scalpels instead and with a host of powers to detect lies. It’s in a soundproof
room deep within the prison, and even if the party tricks the guards they will
still likely end up fighting it to get the last prisoner out. The guards don’t
like this thing a whole lot, and won’t be in a rush to enter the soundproof room
or to ask the PCs how they got its latest victim out alive. Therefore, it’s
entirely possible a particularly convincing party will talk their way into the
devil’s cell, kill it, and talk their way out with all four prisoners in tow.</p>

<p>Getting the knights out without killing a single human guard is worth XP as if
the party had defeated the lot in combat.</p>

<h2 id="mission-2-the-poison-pen-of-kintargo">Mission 2: The Poison Pen of Kintargo</h2>

<p>The quest giver here is Cassius Sargaeta, a captain in the Chelish navy. Not
being a Kintargo native, he’s confined to his ship by Proclamation 8. Sargaeta
hasn’t left town yet because his lover Marquel Aulorian (noble scion and
secretly the Poison Pen of Kintargo) is under house arrest and likely being
sought by Thrune agents for criticizing the government in his writings. Sargaeta
wants the PCs to deliver a letter to Marquel and bring him to the ship.</p>

<p>The PCs learn this on a meeting with the captain, after being invited into the
ship by his first mate, a sassy half-elf gunslinger. Now, it’s quite likely the
PCs will be slow to trust members of the friggin’ Chelish Navy, so a good amount
of this section’s text is dedicated to what happens if they don’t agree to see
him.</p>

<p>The Aulorian estate is defended by human guards who are less beefy than the
dottari, and by a three-headed hellhound. As usual, discretion is advised unless
the PCs want their notoriety increased.</p>

<p>Reuniting the two lovers will net the Silver Ravens a substantial reward: the
captain asks one of the PCs to drop a porcelain teacup on the floor, and
provides the Ravens with favors equal in number to the resulting shards. That’s
a fancy way of saying 1d10, but the book also suggests getting an actual
(cheap!) cup and getting a player to drop it for extra effect.</p>

<p>It seems to me the whole deal is meant to come off as dubious until the very
end. Sargaeta is described as a “Chelish patriot” who is unhappy with Barzilai
specifically but not his government in general. His first mate is cheerfully
unpleasant, and he keeps a halfling slave as a maidservant (the adventure
doesn’t spell that last bit out, but Lem’s backstory is very clear that the
Chelish love enslaving halflings).</p>

<p>Despite all this, getting the Poison Pen to safety is a good thing for the
rebellion, and the 1d10 favors gained as a reward are <em>really</em>
valuable. Sargaeta will agree to anything short of open treason, which means he
will lend his crew for covert actions, provide discreet transport to the Ravens,
deliver a lump sum of money, and so on. If using the scene as written, the best
thing to do would be to play up the gray morality of the situation. GMs who are
uncomfortable with that or who don’t believe their players would take on the
mission as written could replace Sargaeta with a more sympathetic foreign
captain.</p>

<h2 id="mission-3-on-the-slashers-trail">Mission 3: On the Slasher’s Trail</h2>

<p>The text of this mission begins with a brief bout of exposition on the Temple
Hill Slasher, a serial killer who plagued Kintargo a few decades ago and whose
killings are still part of the local folklore. In other words, a fairly obvious
Jack the Ripper expy. The main difference here is that the Slasher was
eventually caught. Only it seems like the killings have started again, using the
exact same MO.</p>

<p>The rumor table at the start of adventure includes some entries dealing with
this new Slasher, and they pay off on Mission 3. The PCs are contacted by a
tiefling tailor named Hetamon Haace, who reveals he’s the leader of the Rose of
Kintargo: a cult of Milani<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> worshippers who’s been laying <em>extremely</em> low as
of late. As is often the case with these NPCs, he’s fully aware of any Silver
Ravens exploits the group hasn’t taken pains to conceal.</p>

<p>Haace feels compelled to ask the Ravens’ help because a member of his own group
has been killed by the new Slasher. He wants their help in tracking the murderer
down and will offer the services of the Rose in return. This will mostly consist
in helping keep the heat off the Ravens’ backs, but they will rise up and help
the fight more directly when the time comes. There’s also a pair of free <em>boots
of levitation</em> in it for the party.</p>

<p>The procedure for tracking down the murderer is laid down in detail: <em>speak with
dead</em> to interrogate the latest victim, and several skill checks to interpret
the provided clues. Getting too many of these wrong is a serious concern here,
since it will mostly shut down the investigation. The book suggests having the
Slasher try to kill a friendly NPC after a few days if this happens, and have
the victim escape to provide any missing details to the group. I suggest simply
providing those details during the initial investigation to avoid killing the
group’s momentum.</p>

<p>From a description of the suspect’s appearance, attire and the smell of a
specific kind of grease that hangs about him, the book says it’s possible to
deduce he’s a tinkerer who rents a shop at a sort of co-working space for
cog-mongers called Vespam Artisans. The place’s owner is fairly sympathetic to
the Ravens and will promptly reveal the suspect’s name (Varl Wex) and where he
lives.</p>

<p>Wex has a room at a tenement house. Depending on how the PCs handled the
investigation up to this point, he will be either away from home when they
arrive or waiting in ambush.</p>

<p>The story here is that Wex came across a sentient magic kukri used by the
original Slasher, and was brainwashed by the weapon into becoming a serial
killer himself. The weapon in question and a whole lot of other incriminating
evidence are hidden in a secret room in the apartment. If Wex is out, he will
arrive during the investigation and either try to bluff his way to the
hidey-hole to retrieve the weapon, or attack at once if the PCs already found
it. If he’s lying in ambush, he will strike from the secret room and try to pick
off the PCs one at a time until he’s found out. Wex will fight to the death,
though he might retreat to set up sneak attacks.</p>

<p>Eliminating Wex is already a service to the city at large and will get the Rose
of Kintargo on the PC’s side. They also have several options on how to dispose
of the body and evidence! The most interesting one is to turn them over to the
authorities, which will immensely bolster the Ravens’ reputation and force
Barzilai to publicly thank the PCs for their service to preserve
appearances. They can also turn them over to a neutral party who will get the
credit for the deed if they don’t want the exposure, but hey, go big or go home!</p>

<p>Similarly, they can hand the evil knife to one of the remaining legal “good”
temples in Kintargo and get a reward equal to its monetary value, or turn it
over to a sensible neutral party like Tiora and get half that value. Either of
these will get the artifact safely destroyed. Any other solutions carry the risk
that the weapon will make its way back to the murder cult who originally created
it, and cause future trouble for the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="conversion-notes">Conversion Notes</h3>

<p>Wex is statted up as a level 10 fighter/rogue, built to stack bleed effects on
his targets, which benefit from the effects of his evil weapon (see below). A
GURPS conversion should probably start from the Assassin or Thief templates,
with around 50-75 extra points spent on making him deadly with a kukri: Weapon
Master (Knives), higher ST, higher skill, and Targeted Attacks to the neck or
femoral arteries if your campaign uses that level of detail.</p>

<p>The evil kukri is named Balgorrah, and contains the soul of a murder cult
priest. It causes greater than normal bleeding and gives the wielder temporary
HP equal to the amount of bleeding it caused. It also tries to compel the
wielder to become a serial killer.</p>

<p>The GURPS version should be Fine, Balanced and Ornate (+1), and enchanted with
Weaken Blood and Steal Vitality. It should also have an IQ score and an Energy
Reserve which it can use to power its own enchantments.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-and-review">Analysis and Review</h2>

<p>Part 2 ends right after describing the three missions above. The only mission
that’s really required for moving the plot forward is Mission 1, but Mission 2
rewards the PCs with such a valuable strategic resource that I would strongly
consider replacing Captain Sargaeta with a more obviously sympathetic NPC if
your group would be disinclined to trust him as written.</p>

<p>Mission 3 seems to be mostly there as filler to give the PCs enough XP to hit
level 6 in time for the adventure’s finale, but it’s interesting enough on its
own merits that I would still keep it in my version of the adventure.</p>

<p>Our next article will look at Part 3, which ends this adventure with a big
dungeon raid.</p>

<p>I’ve recently published a three-post miniseries adapting the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/09/28/elder-scrolls-humans.html">humans</a>,
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/04/elder-scrolls-elves.html">elves</a>, and <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html">other interesting folks</a> from the Elder Scrolls series of
computer games to GURPS. Now I want to talk a bit about how I did it!</p>

<p>These three posts, and the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/09/03/one-post-skyrim.html">One-Post Skyrim</a> adaptation that preceded them,
were the first time in a while where I was able to fully exercise the approach
to adapting video games that I outlined as one of the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/28/adapting-video-games.html">very first articles on
this blog</a>. And the mini-series in particular was where I tried some new
things, and I feel it’s worth talking about these things.</p>

<h2 id="researching-the-source-material">Researching the Source Material</h2>

<p>Everything I said way back when in <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/28/adapting-video-games.html">Adapting Videogames</a> still reflects the
way I think about this process. Fiction takes precedence over original
mechanics, and I get to pick and choose from both in case they contradict
themselves.</p>

<p>For One-Post Skyrim I had just the one game to look at, but for Peoples of
Tamriel I needed to cast a wider net. Elder Scrolls is a sprawling,
decade-spanning franchise, where these contradictions are bound to come up a lot
more often. So how did I deal with it?</p>

<p>My “original sources” here were all the <em>mainline</em> games of the Elder Scrolls
franchise, as described by the <a href="http://uesp.net">Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</a>
wiki<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. That’s still a huge amount of data, and it’s positively filled with
all those contradictions I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Most of them are mechanics-based. Basically, each game in the series differs as
much from its predecessor as, say, D&amp;D 3.0 is from AD&amp;D, <em>at a minimum</em>. I
decided to narrow the field down a little by looking at what changed and what
remained constant between games. Things that changed every game were obviously
less important to replicating its “feel” than things that stayed the same.</p>

<p>The big invariant here is the core gameplay loop: in every game, you wander and
explore the world. You are given quests by NPCs, or discover them through other
means. You enter dungeons, fight the enemies inside, and loot their
treasure. There is a “main quest”, but you can choose to ignore it in favor of
faffing about doing sidequests or simply raiding dungeons as you come across
them.</p>

<p>You might remember I wrote pretty much the exact same thing during One-Post
Skyrim. That’s because these things remain as true in Skyrim as they were in
Arena<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. All of it is very “high level” stuff, and does not require any
specific tabletop mechanics to replicate, which is awesome for me. But how about
the specific mechanical details? When it comes to playable character origins,
the list of invariants is surprisingly small: you can choose from
several. That’s it! The exact composition of the list and what each origin’s
traits are changes significantly from game to game.</p>

<h2 id="adapting-the-peoples-of-tamriel">Adapting the Peoples of Tamriel</h2>

<p>In the end I opted to use the list from Skyrim, which is both the most complete
and the most popular of the franchise (it’s also used by Oblivion and
Online). And when statting them up, I did two things: I avoided using the word
“race” as much as possible, and I didn’t give them any attribute adjustments or
mandatory mental disadvantages. This has the benefit of making these templates
feel very “Skyrim”-like, since that’s also the way Skyrim does things. But there
were other reasons why I chose this approach.</p>

<p>There’s an article out there that says it much better than I can, but
unfortunately I’ve lost the link to it. Basically, the way racial attribute
adjustment works in systems like D&amp;D reinforces character stereotypes in a way
that could be considered racist if it was applied to real-world people. Calling
these bits of character creation <em>races</em> doesn’t help either, since that word
has a lot of baggage from the real world.</p>

<p>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy doesn’t suffer from this to the same extent with attribute
adjustments, since the cost of a racial template is small compared to the
player’s total point budget. It does however, kinda fall prey to it when it
comes to racial advantages and disadvantages. The bigot who says “all cat-folk
are lazy spazzes”, or “all dwarves are hard-headed greedy bastards” ends up
kinda having a point when those traits are a mandatory part of their templates.</p>

<p>I didn’t really want to play in a setting where bigots have a point, even about
entirely fictional populations. I’m pretty satisfied with the final result: all
the templates felt flavorful, and their traits didn’t force players to pick a
particular profession over another as much. Players who want to hew closer to
the cultural stereotypes about a given people could pick from the list of
optional “Other Traits”, and could even pick optional traits listed under a
different template for extra variety.</p>

<p>This worked out fairly well in my case because all the different people of
Tamriel have roughly the same shape and size. GURPS is a system that places a
lot of value on realism, so I imagine I would still need to keep <em>some</em> physical
attribute adjutments in there if I were to include pixies and half-giants in the
lineup. However, in systems or campaigns where that matters less even those
wouldn’t need adjustments. I plan on keeping this approach with any other such
templates I make.</p>

<p>Antes de eu começar todo aquele negócio de Dragon’s Dogma, eu gostaria de
discutir o próprio processo de adaptar um video game. Vai me ajudar a explicar
minhas decisões.</p>

<p>O excelente <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/products/gurps-adaptations">GURPS Adaptations</a> contém muitas informações valiosas sobre como
adaptar ficção tradicional para uma campanha de GURPS. Muitas delas são
igualmente aplicáveis à adaptação de um video game, mas eu sinto que há algumas
considerações adicionais igualmente importantes. Elas são relacionadas ao
<em>gameplay</em>.</p>

<p>“Gameplay” é um termo que engloba tudo o que o jogador faz em um video game,
assim como os mecanismos que governam essas ações. Jogos diferentes lhe dão
diferentes níveis de acesso a esses mecanismos. Um jogo de plataforma permite
que você desenvolva uma intuição sobre a distância máxima dos seus saltos, e um
RPG eletrônico te mostra uma quantidade imensa de números.</p>

<p>Ficção não tem “gameplay”. Mesmo o mais longo dos romances de fantasia com a
mais detalhada descrição de seu sistema de magia nunca vai fazer com que seus
leitores façam mais do que ler o texto para descobrir o que acontece a
seguir. Video games são o exato oposto disso. Mesmo o mais imersivo e narrativo
dos video games vai sempre exigir que você preste tanta atenção ao gameplay
quanto à história e ao cenário.</p>

<p>Se você acha que isso lembra muito o processo de conversão de um sistema de RPG
para o outro, está começando a entender!</p>

<p>Essencialmente, o processo de adaptar um video game para uma campanha de RPG de
mesa apresenta todas as dificuldades de adaptar a ficção <em>e também</em> todas as
dificuldades de converter material entre sistemas diferentes!</p>

<p>Quanto mais transparentes as mecânicas originais do jogo são, paradoxalmente,
mais difíceis elas tornam o esforço de adaptação. Ao adaptar mecânicas, quer de
um video game quer de outro RPG, é muito fácil cair na armadilha de tentar
convertê-las tão detalhadamente quanto possível. Isso pode ser um exercício
intelectual interessante, mas raramente gera um resultado simples e prático.</p>

<p>Minha estratégia preferida é confiar nas forças do sistema “de destino” tanto
quanto possível, adaptando a ficção e tentando recriar as mesmas sensações
passadas pelas mecânicas originais sem travar nos detalhes. Sempre que as
mecânicas conflitam, a ficção tem precedência. Com jogos que são parte de uma
franquia, eu escolho um subconjunto das informações do cenário e das mecânicas
que pintam o retrato mais coerente (ou pelo menos o retrato do qual eu gosto
mais).</p>

<p>No final, eu espero ter uma moldura de campanha que é divertida de jogar e que
se encaixa no idioma do GURPS. E espero que condordem comigo sobre o resultado
:).</p>

<p>This is the third and final post in a mini-series about bringing the peoples of
Tamriel to a GURPS fantasy game. This post deals with anyone who’s neither a
human nor an elf.</p>

<p>Scholars from the Empire or the Aldmeri dominion tend to call these people
“Beast-Folk”, both because many of them bear an obvious resemblance to some sort
of animal and because these exalted nations tend to view them as somewhat
less than civilized. Like everyone else, though, they have rich cultures and
long histories. They are also quite well-adapted to their home environments.</p>

<h2 id="argonian-20-points">Argonian (20 Points)</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Argonian_Female_2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Argonians (or Saxhleel, as they call themselves) are a reptilian people native
to the swampy region of Black Marsh. They resemble scaly humans with a tail and
a lizard head, and sometimes have feathers or horns as well. Their scales come
in various shades of dark brown, gray or green, sometimes marked with patterns
unique to the individual.</p>

<p>Well-adapted to their native environment, Argonians are amphibious and highly
resistant to disease. They’re known as experts in guerilla warfare, having had
to defend their homes against foreign invasions many times in Tamriel’s long and
convoluted history.</p>

<p>Argonian adventurers thrive in flooded environments. Those native to Black Marsh
are commonly Scouts, Barbarians, or Thieves with some supplemental wilderness
survival training. An all-Argonian party can go in underwater adventures without
any special magic or equipment!</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Amphibious {10}; Doesn’t Breathe (Gills, -50%) {10}; Resistant
to Disease +3 {5}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Cold-Blooded {-5}.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>: Tail; Body and head armor needs to be adapted to accommodate the
tail and unusual head shape. This usually doesn’t cost extra, but might restrict
their usage of looted armor.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Argonians are the target of prejudice in several provinces of
Tamriel, like Morrowind and Skyrim. In games taking place mostly in those
provinces, they would have Social Stigma (Minority Group).</p>

<h2 id="khajit-25-points">Khajit (25 points)</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Khajiit_Female_1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Khajit require surprisingly little explanation for those who are already
familiar with Dungeon Fantasy. They’re Catfolk! While an individual Khajit’s
appearance is <em>technically</em> influenced by the configuration of Nirn’s two moons
when they are born, that’s mostly an attempt by the franchise’s writers to
“explain” why the design for playable Khajit characters went from “humans with
funny face tattoos” to something that matches the description of DF Catfolk
pretty much exactly.</p>

<p>Khajit hail from the tropical region of Elsweyr (pronounced “Elsewhere”). This
province is about equally split into an inland expanse or arid badlands, and a
lush coastal region criss-crossed by extensive river basins. The former is
inhabited by fierce nomadic warriors, the later by sugar cane plantation owners,
farm workers, and urban merchants. Those plantations produce Moon Sugar, the
region’s chief export. Moon Sugar’s properties vary a lot depending on what
source you’re consulting: they seem to range from “it’s just sugar” to “it’s
crystallized catnip”. In either case it has many more or less legitimate
culinary and alchemical uses. It can also be distilled into Skooma, a drink
that’s definitely closer to the “catnip” end of the spectrum and banned in most
regions of Tamriel.</p>

<p>Khajit adventurers tend to prefer “skirmisher” professions like Scouts,
Swashbucklers and Thieves. Being naturally equipped with claws, they also put
greater emphasis in unarmed combat than most, and so also count many Martial
Artists among their number.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Catfall {10}; Sharp Claws {5}; Sharp Teeth {1}; Fur {1}; Night
Vision 8 {8}.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>: Tail (not prehensile, and easily tucked into armor).</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: GMs who prefer to use the default Catfolk statistics for
Khajit are free to do so, either in place of these or alongside them (as a
different variety). Addiction to Skooma is a -15 point disadvantage: it’s
incapacitating, highly addictive, and illegal. Addiction to Moon Sugar, if the
GM decides it has drug-like properties at all, is worth -5 points in those
places where it is illegal, and 0 points otherwise. These can apply to <em>anyone</em>,
not just Khajit, no matter what the Altmer try to tell you.</p>

<h2 id="others">Others</h2>

<p>Many allusions are made in Elder Scrolls lore to other “beast-folk” species,
though these have never been playable in the games. A lot of them show up as
enemies, though.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Standard goblins and ogres exist in Tamriel, and are viewed here much as they
are in any other setting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Giants have roamed Skyrim since time immemorial, and maintain a wary
relationship with its human inhabitants. They have a Paleolithic tribal
culture and are known for herding mammoths.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simian Imga share Valenwood with the Bosmer. The Alessian Order that
eventually created the First Empire based their religion on the teachings of
an Imga prophet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Hist are sapient <em>trees</em>, said to be the oldest form of sapient life in
Tamriel. Most of them are located in Black Marsh, and are at the center of
Argonian culture and society.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And so on, and so forth. Throughout various places and times you can also find
snake-people (Lamias), slug-people (Sloads), fox-people (Lilmothiit), Minotaurs,
and so on. Like elves, feel free to introduce a new variety every time your
players think they got it all figured out.</p>

</figure>

<p>It’s been a while since my last post on the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/">Let’s Read Hell’s Rebels</a> series,
but the good thing about maintaining my own site is that there are no
externally-imposed deadlines and a project is only over when I say it’s over! So
let’s keep going!</p>

<p>“Turn of the Torrent” is the second adventure in the path. It expects Pathfinder
characters to be 4th level when they start it, and 7th when they finish
it. Since I imagine a starting Dungeon Fantasy delver is equal to a 7th level
d20 character, the challenges here should still be well within the capabilities
of any party that went through Adventure One.</p>

<h2 id="a-small-recap">A small recap</h2>

<p>As always, check out the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/">project page</a> for links to the previous
installments, but let’s summarize what happened so far. It has been 18 months,
after all.</p>

<p>The Hell’s Rebels campaign takes place in the city of Kintargo, located in the
devil-worshipping fascist nation of Cheliax. The official line is that they’re
only “taking inspiration” from the extremely organized nature of the Nine
Hells<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, but everyone knows the truth. Kintargo in particular has always been
particularly ornery about all this, having only been annexed after a long and
bitter struggle. Leading that struggle were the Silver Ravens, a group of rebels
who have achieved a sort of semi-legendary status in the mind of the citizens of
present-day Kintargo.</p>

<p>Our main villain is a man named Barzilai Thrune, a narcissistic sociopath who
delights in grandstanding, engendering acts of large-scale performative cruelty
against minorities, and surrounding himself with equally despicable
lackeys<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. He found out Kintargo is an auspicious site for a ritual that could
turn him into a minor god, and got himself appointed Lord Mayor of the
city. After having anyone who could oppose him killed, he’s been amusing himself
by making ever more absurd proclamations and otherwise oppressing his
constituency. All of them will die when the ritual is done, so why worry?</p>

<p>The PCs get caught up in all of this and by the end of Adventure One find
themselves leading the group that has the best chance of freeing Kintargo from
Thrune’s grasp: the reborn Silver Ravens. In fact, they’re now big enough that
their current coffee-house-basement hideout is getting a bit cramped.</p>

<h2 id="proclamation-the-ninth">Proclamation The Ninth</h2>

<p>The adventure kicks off with Barzilai’s Ninth proclamation, which targets the
Hellknight Order of the Torrent. All their assets are confiscated and their
members declared outlaws. Anyone caught harboring one of them will be similarly
declared a criminal.</p>

<p>The Hellknight orders are kinda like elite law-enforcement agencies associated
with the government of Cheliax. Most Hellknights are as evil as the name
implies, but until recently there was one notable exception.</p>

<p>The Order of the Torrent was a search-and-rescue unit based out of Kintargo, and
was the only one composed mostly of Lawful Good folks. Predictably, it was also
by far the smallest and less politically influent of the orders, with only 23
members total. Barzilai targets them here because he wants to gift their assets
to his buddies from the Order of the Rack<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. By the time the proclamation is
announced his underlings have pretty much finished the Order of the Torrent off.</p>

<p>After this bit of exposition we get a table of rumors that mostly serves to
foreshadow missions the PCs will undertake later in the adventure, with a false
rumor planted in there that will make them distrust the Order of the Torrent if
they believe in it. There’s also a bit about the toll for Kintargo’s main bridge
being drastically increased, which is not something that would inconvenience the
PCs overmuch but which will cause plenty of unrest among the citizens.</p>

<h2 id="a-cousins-plea">A Cousin’s Plea</h2>

<p>Once the party is done with rumors, they’re contacted by a woman named Setrona
Sabinus, current proprietor of one of Kintargo’s oldest taverns, the Tooth and
Nail. She wants then to find her missing cousin Octavio, who happens to be the
leader of the Torrent. He’s gone missing since the proclamation, and she
imagines he might be laying low in a remote shrine located to the south of the
city.</p>

<p>Optionally, the GM can have Setrona ask them to first look for her cousin in a
sanctioned excruciation that will take place that day, since she doesn’t
actually know if he’s been captured or not. Unlike the unsanctioned variety the
PCs dealt with in the previous adventure, this one is conducted and guarded by
actual dottari guards and Rack Hellknights (four of each).</p>

<p>Octavio isn’t here, but a lower-ranking member of the Torrent is. PCs can try to
rouse the crowd and browbeat the guards into postponing the proceedings, or they
can charge and start a fight.</p>

<p>This section also includes a note on how these frequent excruciations will
actually bolster support for the Ravens. At some point Barzilai will realize
this and stop them.</p>

<h3 id="conversion-notes">Conversion Notes</h3>

<p>The four dottari guards wear mail suits and carry halberds and bows. The Rack
armigers have plate, large shields and broadswords. Building them with the
Squire template plus 25 points or so seems about right: they should be strong
and skilled physical combatants.</p>

<p>None of the two groups will fight to the death - in fact, they’re not all that
united. The dottari will perform a fighting retreat if one of them drops, and
will rout if two of them fall. The knights will retreat as soon as one of them
suffers a major wound. Either group will leave the other to its fate when that
happens. This means even a Pathfinder party can make it out of this CR 9
encounter alive if they are lucky and focus fire on one opponent at a time. DF
delvers should have quite a bit less trouble surviving the encounter, though
it’s no longer the cakewalk their last excruciation was.</p>

<h2 id="shrine-of-saint-senex">Shrine of Saint Senex</h2>

<p>This is the shrine where Octavio is supposed to be hiding out. Most of it is
underground, but there’s a small above-ground area inhabited by two
hippie-looking oracles.</p>

<p>The pair is all of remains of the saint’s cult. They know Octavio is hiding
underground, but the PCs must first gain their thrust. Bringing Setrona along
will make this much easier. Even if the PCs manage to get a friendly reaction
out of the oracles, though, they still insist the party go through the “trials”
awaiting them underground to prove they are worthy.</p>

<p>There are two rooms in the temple’s underground. The first contains a simple
puzzle, with a fight against a rope golem if the party gets it wrong. The second
contains Octavio, hiding out in a crypt full of mummified drowned sailors. He’ll
mistake the party for Thrune agents unless he recognizes them using the
campaign’s notoriety mechanics, or unless Setrona is with them. Yes, this
mini-dungeon can be entirely “solved” without a fight if the party brings
Setrona along.</p>

<p>Octavio Sabinus is a Lawful Good Hellknight<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>, and he will be amenable to
joining the Ravens as long as the PCs can prove to him that the group is a)
capable of opposing Thrune without always resorting to violence and b) making
sure his men are safe. To that end he asks the party to rescue those men from
the Old Kintargo Holding House, which is detailed later in the book. He will
remain hiding in the crypt until that is done, and will join the Ravens as a
unique ally when the PCs complete the mission. Completing it in a <em>subtle</em>
manner will make him even more loyal to the cause.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-and-review">Analysis and Review</h2>

<p>The paragraph above is exactly where part 1 of the adventure ends. Yes, it’s
basically 90% background info and exposition. The playable part consists of an
optional combat encounter which the book doesn’t recommend including and what’s
essentially a one-room dungeon bookended by two friendly chats assuming the PCs
do the smart thing and bring Setrona along. It could take less than half a
session, start to finish.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more detail about the rescue mission Octavio wants the PCs to
perform, but even that is only presented in part two. The general verbosity and
somewhat poor organization I’ve seen in official Pathfinder adventures rears its
head again.</p>

<p>The optional brawl against the dottari and armigers is somewhat easier for DF
delvers, and would be a good bit of fun if your group is in the mood to kick
some fascist ass. If they’re anxious to get on with the main story it’s best to
skip the encounter, have Setrona invite herself to go with the party and get to
the talk with Octavio as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We’ll read through Part 2 in the next post in this series.</p>
