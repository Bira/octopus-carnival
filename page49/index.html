<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Like beholders and mind flayers, Displacer Beasts are one of those monsters who
are so uniquely D&amp;D that they’ve been excluded from the SRD. They look like big
black panthers with two squid-like tentacles protruding from their shoulder
blades. The trait that gives them their name, however, is the ability to look
like they’re about two meters to the left of their real location. They appear
both on the Monster Manual and on the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual contains only the usual couple of paragraphs for its entries,
but the MV piles on the lore.</p>

<p>Displacer beasts are native to the Feywild, but can also be found in the world.
They’re cunning carnivores who make extensive use of their illusory powers both
to hunt and to escape from danger. Their preferred habitats are dense forests
with plenty of foliage and caves to use as hiding spots. When hunting, they
stalk their prey and attack from ambush at the most opportune time.</p>

<p>These creatures have gained such fame for their strength and cunning that they
often feature in heraldic devices for noble houses and organizations that want
to be known for possessing these qualities.</p>

<p>As magical beasts they’re smarter than most animals, but still have a bestial
disposition. They have no language or civilization, but they are quite able to
set up really clever ambushes, track prey by following clues in addition to
using their scent, remember good hunting spots like, say, a seasonal trade
route. They’re also smart enough to retreat if outmatched, and prefer attacking
animals to humanoids.</p>

<p>Though displacer beasts rarely gather in groups larger than a mated pair,
particularly large and intelligent specimens have been known to form and lead
packs composed mostly of other, lesser predators. Some humanoids can also
befriend them and employ them for hunting, war, or guarding territory.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The standard <strong>Displacer Beast</strong> has MM and MV versions. In both, it’s a Large
Fey Magical Beast, and a Level 9 Skirmisher with 97 HP. Its Speed is 12, it’s
trained in Perception and has low-light vision.</p>

<p>The displacer beast has two passive traits: Threatening Reach and the expected
Displacement. The first makes it able to perform opportunity attacks against
targets anywhere within the reach of its attacks, and applies mainly to the
tentacles. The displacement power has significantly different wording between
versions.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual says all melee and ranged attacks have a 50% chance to miss
the beast. The effect ends when the beast is hit by an attack but it resumes
when it moves 2+ squares on its turn.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault clarifies the miss chance: any melee or ranged attack that
would hit the beast actually misses if the attack roll was odd. You can see how
13th Age evolved from D&amp;D 4 here! The effect still stops when the beast does get
hit, but it resumes automatically at the start of its next turn.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 2 tentacle, which in the MM suffers from the damage
bug. It also has a slightly stronger Reach 1 bite. The MM version has a Beast’s
Fury standard-action ability that allows it to make two tentacle attacks and a
bite against a single target it has combat advantage against. The MV trades that
for Cunning Blitz, which allows it to shift half its speed (6 squares!) and make
tentacle attacks against one or two targets.</p>

<p>Both versions can shift 1 square as a reaction when an attack misses them,
though the MM version weirdly restricts that to attacks that miss because of the
displacement. I prefer the broader MV power here.</p>

<p>The MV-only <strong>Savage Displacer Beast</strong> is the slower, beefier variant. A Level
11 Brute with 136 HP, it loses the Perception training and runs at “only” Speed
8.</p>

<p>The Displacement and Threatening Reach abilities are the same, but this beast
prefers to push others around instead of shifting. Its tentacle and bite attacks
do level-appropriate Brute damage, and the tentacle pushes 1 square on a
hit. The beast can also push someone who misses it with a melee attack 1 square.</p>

<p>And finally we have the <strong>Displacer Beast Pack Lord</strong>, present in both
books. It’s a Huge Fey Magical Beast and a Level 13 Elite Skirmisher with 258
HP. In both books, the Pack Lord has all the same abilities as the standard
beast, plus a few additions.</p>

<p>First, while the other two types of displacer beats have an Int of 4, the Pack
Lord has 10! As the name implies, this is the one that can tame other animals
and form them into a pack.</p>

<p>In addition to doing more damage with all of its attacks, it has Reach 3
tentacles. The MV version also gains an attack called Clear The Path, which
targets Reflex in a Close Burst 3 and slides everyone it hits up to 3
squares. On a miss, it does half damage and still slides the target 1
square. This recharges when the beast is first bloodied.</p>

<p>When someone misses the Pack Lord with an attack, both versions can make a
tentacle attack against the attacker in addition to shifting 1 square. It also
ignores all difficult terrain and penalties for squeezing, an ability which
surely makes it a joy to fight in a thicket tangled with undergrowth.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 13: a pack lord, two regular displacer beasts, and
a briar witch dryad. This is likely to be an equal partnership between the pack
lord and the dryad.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I definitely prefer the MV writeup on this one. It’s a little more powerful and
sounds a little more fun. I also like that the displacer beast is explicitly not
an “attacks on sight and fights to the death” monster, and someone who can talk
to animals can even make an ally of it. Even the regular variant: it has the
brainpower of your average ogre and a much better disposition (they’re
Unaligned).</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Rejoice, oh reader, for we are finally done with the devils! Our next monster is
no less horrific, but at at least it’s not a fiend.</p>

<p>I think devourers made their first appearance in D&amp;D 3.5. Third Edition tried
really hard to create a new generation of iconic monsters with mixed success at
best, but I think they got it right here. These things are scary! Despite this,
they’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>When a mortal dies their soul goes to the Shadowfell, where the Raven Queen
sorts it out and sends it on its way to the great beyond. When a <em>psychotic
serial killer</em> dies, there’s a chance their soul goes AWOL once it hits the
Shadowfell and builds itself a new body out of other people’s flesh and
bones. This is how devourers are made.</p>

<p>Devourers retain all the mental faculties they had in life, which means they get
to keep their Evil disposition and Hannibal Lecter-like intellect. There are
several varieties of devourer: some enjoy eating their victims still-pulsating
viscera, while others go straight for the soft, yummy soul at the center of
their flesh wrapping.</p>

<p>I suspect that given time they’d prepare some nicely cooked fava beans and a
bottle of Chianti to go with their victims, but they’ll eat them on the spot
mid-fight if they’re in a hurry.</p>

<p>Devourers are smart enough to value strategic alliances with other monsters, and
they’re even able to hold their unnatural appetite in check to work with living
allies. Of course, they’re still only going to ally with creatures that don’t
mind their proclivities.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three devourer varieties here.</p>

<p>The <strong>Spirit Devourer</strong> is a Large Shadow Humanoid (undead), and a Level 11
Elite Soldier with 224 HP. It’s trained in perception and has Darkvision. Being
undead, it’s immune to disease and poison, has Resist 15 Necrotic, and
Vulnerable 5 radiant. It moves with Speed 6.</p>

<p>Its basic melee attack is a Reach 2 claw, but the real star of the show here is
Trap Spirit. This has Range 5 and targets the Fortitude of a living humanoid. On
a hit, the victim’s body vanishes and its spirit is trapped as an agonizing
effigy inside the devourer’s exposed rib cage (save ends). Until the victim
saves, it can do absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>While the monster has a victim so trapped, it gains a +2 bonus to all defenses,
and access to two other actions. Devour Spirit is an at-will minor action that
does 10 damage to the victim, and either heals the devourer by the same amount
or allows it to immediately use Spirit Rupture. This is a standard action attack
that targets the Will of everyone in a Close Burst 1. On a hit, it does necrotic
damage and immobilizes the target for a turn. On a miss, it does half damage
without the status effect.</p>

<p>Should the victim be killed by Devour Spirit, it <em>can’t be resurrected by Raise
Dead</em>. This is particularly concerning here because I don’t think there’s any
other way to bring characters back from the dead at this level. At least, there
weren’t at the time this book was published.</p>

<p>The <strong>Viscera Devourer</strong> is a little different because it’s exposed abdominal
cavity comes pre-filled with squirming, drooling intestines tipped with gnashing
mouths. It’s a Medium Shadow Humanoid (undead), and a Level 12 Controller with
124 HP. It has the same senses, resistances and speed as the Spirit Devourer.</p>

<p>Aside from the weaksauce basic claw attack, this devourer can use up to four of
its tentacle-like intestines as a weapon. Their Reach is 1, and on a hit they do
a bit of physical damage and grab the target. The devourer can grab up to four
victims this way, or use multiple bowels to grab a single target, giving them a
-2 to escape the grab for each extra intestine. Grabbed victims take 5 ongoing
necrotic damage for each appendage wrapped around them until they escape, with
the devourer gaining the same amount of HP as it drains their life.</p>

<p>Oh, and it also gains a +2 to all defenses while it has at least one person
grabbed.</p>

<p>And finally we have the <strong>Soulspike Devourer</strong>, AKA the Big One. It’s a Huge
Shadow Humanoid (undead), and a Level 20 Elite Soldier (Leader) with 376 HP. It
has the same speed, senses and resistances as its smaller cousins, though its
numbers here are more extreme: resist necrotic 20 and vulnerable 10 radiant.</p>

<p>The Soulspike Devourer’s gimmick is that it impales the souls of its victims on
the many bone spikes that protude from where its ribs should be. This happens
whenever its basic claw attack reduces a target to 0 HP. When encountered, the
devourer will probably have at least one spirit so impaled. It’s maximum
“capacity” is 4.</p>

<p>Impaled victims can’t perform actions at all. They can try to make a save to
escape when the devourer takes radiant damage, but otherwise they’re
helpless. The only other way to free them is to destroy the devourer. If either
of these things happen their body reappears next to the monster’s and can be
brought back to health in the usual way. The devourer and any allies within 10
squares of it gain a bonus to all their defenses equal to half the number of
soulspiked spirits.</p>

<p>The devourer’s other special attack is Soul Shatter, which targets Will on a
Close Burst 3, does a lot of necrotic damage, and <em>stuns</em> for a turn, after
which the targets are weakened (save ends). This recharges whenever the
devourer uses its variant of the Devour Spirit ability.</p>

<p>This, in turn, is a standard action that automatically <em>kills</em> one of the
soulspiked spirits and heals the devourer for 75 HP. The victim’s dead body
reappears adjacent to the monster, and it would seem that they can be
resurrected via Raise Dead normally.</p>

<p>The sample encounters showcase some of those unholy alliances. The first is
level 11, a spirit devourer, a vampire lord, and 5 vampire spawn. The second is
level 13, 2 viscera devourers working for a posse of drow.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Spooky! I also can kinda see why they didn’t make it into the Monster Vault - by
the time that book came out, monsters that heal themselves had gone out of
style. Still, I think they might be fine if used in moderation. The devourers
presented here are all in dire need of a damage fix, but otherwise they should
be able to scare your players both on a roleplaying and on a mechanical
level. The soulspike devourer in particular could literally eat an ice devil for
breakfast.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>The War Devil, previously known as the Horned Devil and also known as the
Malebranche, has been a staple of D&amp;D since at least AD&amp;D First Edition. You
know those traditional images of winged, horned devils poking the damned with
tridents? They depict these guys. In 4e, they’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A War Devil is about the most powerful devil that’s likely to be found in the
service of a summoner. In the overall diabolic hierarchy they only take orders
from pit fiends or archidevils. It some mortal tyrant is summoning up a literal
army from Hell, a malebranche is going to be at the head of that army, and will
have ice devil senior officers. At Int 15, that malebranche is also likely
cooking up a scheme to bring his pit fiend boss into the world for a hostile
takeover of the tyrant’s operation.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The War Devil is a Level 22 Brute (Leader) with 255 HP. It has a speed of 8, and
a clumsy flight speed of 8. Like all devils it has darkvision and is highly
resistant to fire (resistance 30, in this case).</p>

<p>Its attacks are a little weird. The basic melee attack is a Reach 1 claw which,
as usual for devils, is weak and useless. The infamous trident is Reach 2 and,
weirdly enough, recharges on a 4-6 instead of being at-will. It does more damage
than the claw, but way less than it should for a level 22 brute. On a hit the
target also takes a bit of ongoing damage, slides to a square adjacent to the
malebranche, and is knocked prone.</p>

<p>Despite being a brute, the war devil has a very soldierly minor action at-will
ability called Besieged Foe. This automatically marks a target within line of
sight of the malebranche, and gives the monster’s allies +2 to attacks made
against it. This lasts until the malebranche uses the ability against someone
else, or until the end of the encounter.</p>

<p>As an at-will move action it can use Devilish Transposition, a teleport power
which makes it swap places with an allied devil within 20 squares.</p>

<p>And as a minor action that recharges on 5-6, it can employ Fiendish Tactics to
direct up to two equal-or-lower-level devil allies to make a move action or a
basic attack out of turn.</p>

<p>As a brute the War Devil wants to be right on the front lines tying up your
defenders. Then when one of its more mobile buddies manages to make it to your
squishies, it’s going to swap places with them and direct its <em>other</em> buddies to
run closer for a proper stomping.</p>

<p>War devils pair exceedingly well with… other war devils! They can each use
Besieged Foe on a different target and engage someone else they’re not marking,
and can use Fiendish Tactics on each other. They also go well with other highly
mobile devils to set up transposition combos, and can be pretty dangerous when
combined with a ridiculous number of legion devils.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 21: 1 war devil, 1 ice devil, 2 bone devils and 12
legion devil legionnaires (the level 21 variant). Remember that both the bone
devils and the legionnaires can teleport at will!</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>The tactical aspect of the war devil’s powers is quite interesting, but they
suffer heavily from the math bug. Personally, I’d make their trident an at will
attack with level-appropriate damage and get rid of the claw while keeping
everything else. I’d also make them soldiers instead of brutes, since the flavor
of their powers is a lot more “soldierly” than “brutish”.</p>

<p>Flavor-wise… I guess I can kinda see why they were left out of the Monster
Vault. Even back in previous editions I imagine it would be hard to distinguish
a horned devil from, say, a bearded devil if you were not already familiar with
the monster entries. Changing their name to War Devil was probably an attempt at
making them more distinctive, but the success was mixed. Mechanically they’re a
bit like junior pit fiends, so if you’re strapped for space and are already
including pit fiends in your lineup, I can see leaving these guys out.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Succubi are very traditional D&amp;D monster. Just like mariliths (the <em>other</em> sexy
fiend), they’ve been a part of the game since the start. Unlike mariliths,
sexiness is their main schtick. Here we can find them both in the Monster Manual
and in the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Now, the first thing anyone familiar with older editions will notice is that
there’s something very non-traditional about succubi in Fourth Edition. They’re
devils!</p>

<p>You see, from at least AD&amp;D 1st edition all the way to 3.5, succubi were
demons. I suspect this was mainly due to their Chaotic Evil alignment, since
they’ve always been beautiful and cunning manipulators with superlative skill in
seduction and other mind games. They’re still all those things in Fourth
Edition, which has approximately nothing to do with the demon idiom while being
a 100% culture fit for Hell. Making them devils makes a lot of sense from that
perspective. As devils, their alignment is Evil.</p>

<p>A succubus is all about the classic concept of infernal temptation, using their
guile and good looks to convince foolish mortals to sign away their souls and
perform evil deeds. They might also be sent to the world as emissaries to
important mortals, establishing channels of communication between these villains
and the lords of Hell.</p>

<p>There’s no Succubus Lore entry in the MM, possibly because of space concerns,
but there is one very interesting detail in their description: unlike in
previous editions there is absolutely no mention of a succubus’ natural form
being that of a beautiful woman with bat wings (even though the illustration
depicts one like that). Instead, the description says they take the form of
beautiful men and women to tempt mortals.</p>

<p>This means there’s no separate “incubus” monster, and opens up a lot of other
possibilities. Maybe all succubi are genderfluid! Maybe their real appearance is
the lumpy hunchbacked goblin-thing of medieval legend… or it could just be a
real pretty bat-winged humanoid of any gender (including “none”). I mean, they
are fallen angels, and angels are androgynous.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The MM and MV versions are quite similar, so we can discuss both of them
simultaneously. Succubi are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils,
shapechangers). The Shapechanger keyword applies to any monster who can change
their shape in some way. It’s mostly there for reference, since the actual rules
related to this will be in the monster’s stat block.</p>

<p>Succubi are Level 9 Controllers with 90 HP. They have ground and fly speeds of
6, and the usual devil traits of Darkvision and Fire Resistance 20.</p>

<p>A succubus can Change Shape as a minor action, altering its physical form to
that of any Medium humanoid until it decides to change again or drops to 0
HP. It can duplicate any specific individual that fits that category and whom it
has seen before. Noticing the deception requires passing a DC 30 Insight check
according to the MV.</p>

<p>Going by the difficulty table, that’s considered a Hard check for Level 15
characters, meaning a level 15 character with both high Wisdom and Insight
training but no further Insight min-maxing will pass this around 50% of the
time. Level-appropriate PCs will find it even harder to spot a succubus in
disguise unless they spend a lot of effort on that min-maxing.</p>

<p>The succubus’ basic melee attack is a Reach 1 Corrupting Touch which which does
untyped damage and is otherwise uninteresting. The real beauty is in its other
attacks. There’s a straight-up Dominate attack that targets Will at range 5, and
dominates for a turn on a hit. Dominated targets act under the direction of the
dominator, but also count as dazed.</p>

<p>Then there’s the infamous Charming Kiss, which is more insidious. It’s reach 1
and targets Will. A hit means the target can’t attack the succubus, and will
interpose itself between any melee or ranged attacks targeting the devil if the
two are adjacent to each other. This lasts until one of the succubus’ allies
attacks the target, or until the succubus is reduced to 0 HP. This effect can be
sustained <em>indefinitely</em> out of combat as long as the succubus can kiss the
target at least once every 24 hours. More on that under Final Impressions.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, there isn’t much difference between versions, and most of
them are in the Charming Kiss. The MM version has the effect described above as
a <em>secondary</em> attack, requiring an successful (non-damaging) attack against AC
before the attack against Will can be rolled. The MV version has the attack
against Will as the primary, which I like. It also specifies that the
interposing effect is an Imediate Interrupt, which IIRC limits it to once per
turn. I like this change less, because it sounds a bit less fun to the cruel GM
in me.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 9, 1 succubus, 2 snaketongue assassins (yuan-ti)
and 2 constrictor snakes. Zehir wasn’t mentioned by name under “gods who are
friends with Asmodeus”, but this is like the third snake-themed encounter in the
multi-entry, so I guess he’s included in that group.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>The succubus is the iconic “sexy monster”… in theory. My impression is that if
you want to turn even the most impulsive lecherous barbarian into a chaste
ascetic all you have to do is announce a succubus is somewhere nearby. And if
you want to turn that barbarian into a chaste ascetic <em>contract lawyer</em>, you
show them the description of Charming Kiss. They’re going to spend all their
time between turns looking for loopholes in there. It’s wonderful!</p>

<p>Let’s enumerate a few of them… A PC under the effect of Charming Kiss can’t
attack the succubus, but they are in no way compelled to attack the other
PCs and can still attack the succubus’ allies normally. They are compelled to
take attacks aimed at the succubus if the two are adjacent, but are <em>not</em>
compelled to stay adjacent to it.</p>

<p>I mean, clearly the intent is that the Kiss makes the target fall in love with
the succubus. They’d want to stay close to her and make impassioned pleas for
the party to spare her and so on. But I think few players would enjoy
roleplaying that to the detriment of the group, particularly in the middle of a
fight. So here you have our brave barbarian gloating that he’s far too clever to
be taken in by the succubus’ devilish wiles… when in truth the succubus has
succeeded in turning him into a chaste ascetic contract lawyer who keeps running
away from her.</p>

<p>The succubus can pursue by flying, and can keep trying to charm other
people. There’s no restriction on the number of charmed targets! And there’s
always Dominate for preventing the PCs from running away. Clearly, the best
succubus encounter isn’t the one described above, but a succubus surrounded by
innocent charmed victims who will do anything to protect their love.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I originally wrote this as a comment on <em>It Came From the Bookshelf</em>, but it
looks like Blogger’s comment system simply ate it. So I’m expanding it as a
response post instead.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, <em>It Came from the Bookshelf</em> is a blog by John Frazer,
who is using it to review every single book in his extensive RPG
collection. This includes a few GURPS books, and not too long ago he finished
making very insightful comments about pretty much the entire Transhuman Space
line.</p>

<p>And a few days ago he made a post about <a href="http://www.itcamefromthebookshelf.com/2019/11/gurps-illuminati-university.html">GURPS Illuminati University</a>! His
review is quite negative and I’d even say scathing. While I can see where he’s
coming from, I don’t think I’d go quite that far.</p>

<p>You know those times when a player tries to tell a story to their friends about
this absolutely hilarious thing that happened in the player’s campaign? And that
hilarious story ends up getting some polite chuckles at most, because it was
only funny if you were there when it happened.</p>

<p>I’m sure lots of us have been on both ends of this situation multiple times, and
know how it feels. And well, GURPS IOU is that hilarious story in book form.</p>

<p>If I remember its introduction correctly, there was this private BBS maintained
by some people at SJG and their friends, and they used to run a silly campaign
full of in-jokes and silly references to the Illuminati books and to lots of
other media they liked. And then they turned that campaign into a book and
published it. And that’s GURPS IOU: the story that’s only funny if you were
there, in book form.</p>

<p>I can totally see how someone would loathe this silly, in-jokey setting if they
were going into it right after reviewing every Transhuman Space book. I can
totally see how someone can read it and simply not find it funny, too.</p>

<p>It’s probably not something Steve Jackson Games would have published today, but
the mid-90’s were the golden age of cheaply-bound GURPS Third Edition books on
exceedingly specific settings and topics. There were hundreds of the things!
What’s one more? And their home game gets to be immortalized with an ISBN and
everything! Plus it has illustrations by their artist player! Who happens to be
Phil Foglio…</p>

<p>That “reference barrage” school of nerdy humor also seems to have been in vogue
back then, which helps. Teenagers from Outer Space was out around the same time,
for example, and was widely regarded as the state of the art in anime RPGs. It
was basically a bundle of very specific anime references wrapped around a tiny
handful of rules.</p>

<p>I read GURPS IOU very early in my “nerd career”, when I was really into that
sort of humor. I was just learning about this whole world of stuff and it felt
really awesome to get all the references (“Dr. What! I know what that is!”). And
when I finally moved to another city for college and actually met enough people
who also knew about those things, it felt awesome to tell these jokes to them
and have them understand the references too. I didn’t get all of the jokes, but
I got enough to spark those feelings above, and to add some of my own equally
horrible ones to the lot when I GMed.</p>

<p>Call it weirdness, call it bad taste, but I got at least a couple of sessions of
hilarious enjoyment out of this book. It holds a special nostalgic place in my
heart for that. Even though it’s only funny if you were there.</p>
