        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Before we launch into talking about domains, let’s talk about
warpriests. “Warpriest” is the official name for the Essentials version of the
Cleric class.</p>

<p>Classic PHB Clerics (also known as “Templars” post-Essentials) had a set of
Strength-based melee weapon powers and another of Wisdom-based ranged implement
powers. They were generally discouraged from mixing-and-matching, and over time
the community decided that the Wisdom-based “laser cleric” build was the better
of the two, particularly when you only had the core. There were certain levels
that had no Strength powers in them, a situation that would only be remedied in
supplements.</p>

<p>Warpriests are another attempt at a melee cleric - all of their attack abilities
are are Wisdom-based <em>weapon</em> powers. Warpriest Domains are the solution found
by Essential’s designers to reduce the number of decisions a player must make in
order to play a cleric. Your pick one at character creation, and that determines
not only all of your level 1 powers but also most of the encounter powers and
features you get at higher levels all the way to the end of epic tier. They’re
practically ready-made builds.</p>

<p>Technically, some of these belong to your paragon path, but Warpriests are in
effect limited to a single choice there, which continues to provide powers from
your chosen domain. Someone who is really into character optimization might pick
a path from another source, but you can just stick to the default Devout
Warpriest path and still be pretty effective.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Fallen Lands, the book that introduced Warpriests, also
introduced the Sun and Storm domains. Heroes of Shadow added the Death
domain for spooky clerics, and Dragon 392 included the Earth domain.</p>

<p>The Neverwinter campaign setting gives us four more domains, doubling the amount
available in the game at the time of its publication. These are all dedicated to
specific FR gods, but they can be used for similar deities from this or other
settings. Though the Neverwinter campaign focuses on the heroic tier, the
domains presented here include powers for the full 30 levels of a character’s
career.</p>

<p>I’m going to talk about each domain in very general terms, as it would take an
age to go through every power in detail. We’ll cover one domain per post, and
they should each be fairly short.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/06/04/elf-variants.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: Elf and Eladrin Racial Variants</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>When I introduced eladrin in my readings of the Monster Manual, I wrote that I
loved that 4e decided to make a more obvious split between the “fey magician”
and “woodsy archer” archetypes for elves, because previous attempts were usually
a bit muddled and tended to vary too much between settings.</p>

<p>Well, Forgotten Realms was one of these previous attempts, since it had sun,
moon, wood, and wild elves. From reading this book, I know now that these elf
types form a spectrum from “more fey” to “more woodsy”, but I didn’t know this
before looking it up. Other settings like Greyhawk and Dragonlance have their
own proprietary classifications.</p>

<p>The story of elves in FR as told by this book is similar to the generic version:
they arrived from the Feywild at the dawn of time as a single people and split
into three separate ones over the following centuries: sun elves, moon elves,
and those who would become the drow. After the war that originated the drow,
some of the survivors decided to go back to nature and became wood and wild
elves.</p>

<p>For our purposes here, Sun and Moon Elves are eladrin racial variants, while
Wood and Wild Elves are elf racial variants.</p>

<h2 id="moon-elves">Moon Elves</h2>

<p>Moon Elves are the friendlier sort of eladrin. Their cultural wanderlust means
they roamed further than their cousins and took longer to build stationary
empires, but also established good relations with most of the other peoples of
the world. While some of them became more isolationist after the Spellplague,
you can still find moon elves living in many “mortal” kingdoms and
communities. They consider themselves citizens of their nation first, and moon
elves second.</p>

<p>With the Feywild in conjunction with the world, many moon elves have also moved
over there to explore the plane anew.</p>

<p>Typical moon elf PCs are curious, open-minded, and bold, believing that magic
can be found anywhere and good deeds should not be hidden.</p>

<p>They can choose to replace their skill bonuses to Arcana and History with
Insight and Streetwise, and to replace the Eladrin Education feature with
<strong>Elven Weapon Proficiency</strong> (longbow and shortbow).</p>

<p>For background picks, they can choose between the Diplomacy and Streetwise
skills, and the Chondathan, Damaran, and Untheric languages. All are different
human languages, I think.</p>

<h2 id="sun-elf">Sun Elf</h2>

<p>Sun Elves are assholes. They consider themselves superior to everyone else, even
other elves. To many of them the Spellplague proved that even the non-elven gods
are inferior to the elven ones, since the latter emerged mostly unscathed and
the former very much didn’t. Some of them welcome their renewed connection to
the Feywild, while others view the “core eladrin” newcomers from that plane as
yet another inferior species.</p>

<p>Sun elf characters are typically patient, aloof, and incredibly racist. I think
their lore in previous editions even has them engaging in genocidal plans? Even
if I’m misremembering that bit I would probably still not allow sun elf PCs.</p>

<p>They can choose to replace their Arcana/History skill bonuses with
Bluff/Insight, Eladrin Weapon Proficiency with the same Elf Weapon Proficiency
moon elves get, and Eladrin Education with <strong>Wizard Implement
Proficiency</strong>. This lets them use wands, orbs and staffs with implement powers
from any class.</p>

<p>Their background picks are the Arcana, Bluff, History and Insight skills, or the
Draconic language.</p>

<h2 id="wild-elf">Wild Elf</h2>

<p>Wild Elves are also assholes. They are described as being as xenophobic as sun
elves, and even more isolationist. Their culture is all about living as close to
nature as possible and venerating the primal spirits, which they believe is how
the common ancestors to all elves lived in ancient times. According to them
everyone else is Doing it Wrong, even other elves.</p>

<p>Wild elf characters are typically respectful of nature and the spirits, nomadic
in honor of the wanderlust Corellon gave their people, and incredibly racist.</p>

<p>They can replace Elven Accuracy with <strong>Subtle Step</strong>, which lets them shift
their speed once per encounter as a move action. This is very useful considering
elves ignore forest-themed difficult terrain. They can also replace Group
Awareness with <strong>Wild Elf Weapon Proficiency</strong> (javelin, spear, longspear).</p>

<p>Their associated background skills are Nature, Perception, and Stealth.</p>

<h2 id="wood-elves">Wood Elves</h2>

<p>Wood Elves are the most similar to core elves. They have friendly relations with
other peoples, and while they also live close to nature they are not nomadic.</p>

<p>Typical wood elves are protective of their forest homes, but also careful and
compassionate. A wood elf might let a trespasser go by if that trespass is not
doing any actual harm, whereas a wild elf would kill them on principle.</p>

<p>They can replace Elven Accuracy with <strong>Sense Threat</strong>, which lets them roll
Perception for initiative and give all allies with a lower initiative than them
a +2 bonus to their own rolls.</p>

<p>Okay, let me stop for a moment here. This feels amazingly overpowered. The power
itself is described in “natural language” not much different from the
paraphrased paragraph above, so we don’t know if it’s a power or just a passive
ability. In this case, though, there is no difference - you only ever roll
Initiative once per fight, so an encounter power like this would get used every
fight anyway.</p>

<p>Elf rangers, rogues and fey warlocks simply must train Perception and get this
ability. With their ancestry bonuses to Wisdom and Perception, this ensures they
will almost always go first, and give +2 Initiative to the entire rest of the
party too. Clerics care a bit less about going first, but that Initiative bonus
to all allies would still make this power nearly mandatory from a mechanics
perspective. You’re more or less getting an entire warlord class feature for
free.</p>

<p>OK, going back to their other ability: they can replace Group Awareness with
<strong>Reactive Stealth</strong>, which lets them roll Stealth to hide at the same time they
roll Initiative, if they have cover or concealment. Another “mandatory” pick for
stealthy strikers, and better than the equivalent utility power from the Bregan
Spy since you get it at level 1.</p>

<p>Wood elf background picks are the Diplomacy, Insight and Nature skills, and the
Chondathan, Damaran, Dwarven, Giant and Goblin languages.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Someone among this book’s authors <em>really</em> likes wood elves. They’re basically
100% core book elves in outlook and narrative role, but their alternate features
are by far the most powerful in this entry. Making Sense Threat into a Daily
power would bring it to within barely acceptable bounds, though it would still
be quite a bit stronger than the similar ability we saw for Oghma’s Faithful.</p>

<p>Wild and Sun Elves also have a couple of interesting abilities in Subtle Step
and Wizard Implement Proficiency respectively. The rest of these variant
abilities are more or less equivalent to what they replace. Moon elves are the
only variant here that could become proficient in both longbows and longswords
regardless of class, since they can have the two proficiency traits at the same
time.</p>

<p>Lore-wise, I would again probably not allow players to play Sun or Wild elves as
written, because those two variants are racist assholes. I would still let them
take their replacement features if they so wanted, while being some other type
of elf or eladrin.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Forgotten Realms has had a list of setting-specific elf and dwarf subraces since
its inception, one which differs from the setup in the 4e Player’s Handbook. The
FR Player’s Guide releases a few years before Neverwinter included a few notes
mapping them to the 4e setup, but those were mostly roleplaying-oriented. Here,
we go deeper and get variant rules for them.</p>

<p>Each variant has a set of benefits that replace standard traits from the
PHB. Players can choose as many of these as they want, so it’s still possible to
choose zero and play a PHB-standard character. Variants also have associated
background skills, which work like those from the themes and might also include
languages. If you pick a language, you’re fluent in it both in speech and
writing.</p>

<p>Note that you can still only have one background pick - if you choose a skill or
language from these variants, you can’t pick one from your theme or another
source.</p>

<p>In the rest of this post, we’ll be looking at the variants for dwarves. Next one
is elves.</p>

<h2 id="forgotten-realms-dwarves">Forgotten Realms Dwarves</h2>

<p>DR dwarves were forged by Moradin at the dawn of time, deep underground. They
reached the surface in a moutainous region and built one of its first mortal
empires. Divisions among this empire caused part of the population to migrate
west into the Great Rift, a plains region filled with underground caves. This
was lucky because some ancient cataclysm then wiped out the original
Mountainhome.</p>

<p>These plains dwarves split further over the course of history: some journeyed
further into the world, while some stayed on the Rift. Distance changed these
two groupings, though they remain on friendly terms and have a lot of culture in
common.</p>

<h3 id="gold-dwarves">Gold Dwarves</h3>

<p>Gold Dwarves are those who stayed on and under the Great Rift. They proudly
trace their ancestry back to the dawn of time, and as a result are a deeply
traditionalist people that places great value on codes of honor. They believe
each individual has their pre-determined place in society and frown upon those
who would reject their fate.</p>

<p>Before the spellplague, gold dwarves had started expanding and migrating out of
the Rift, and this is what saved them as a culture when the plague hit and
destroyed it. A lot of the survivors returned and are attempting to rebuild, and
the disaster also convinced some of them to seek new ways of doing things where
tradition fails them. Other clans have instead doubled down and become actively
xenophobic.</p>

<p>A typical Gold Dwarf PC is expected to place great importance on tradition and
lineage, and to respect their elders. Getting to know someone also means
learning about their family tree.</p>

<p>They can choose to replace Cast-Iron Stomach with <strong>Cast-Iron Mind</strong>, gaining a
+5 to saves vs. ongoing psychic damage. They can also replace Dwarven Weapon
Proficiency with <strong>Gold Dwarf Weapon Proficiency</strong> to become proficient with the
war pick and the maul.</p>

<p>Their background skill is Dungeoneering, and their background languages are Deep
Speech and Elven. They deal with drow and other Underdark denizens a lot.</p>

<h3 id="shield-dwarves">Shield Dwarves</h3>

<p>Shield Dwarves migrated out of the Great Rift early, spreading through the world
and encountering more foreign people over their history. As a result they’re
more open to seeking out friends and forging alliances. Though they also value
tradition and honor, they do not consider it dishonorable for an individual to
seek to forge their own destiny, even when it takes them away from home. Delzoun
was founded by Shield Dwarves.</p>

<p>Impermanence seems to be a big thing for your typical shield dwarf PC. They are
open to alliances and friendships because they know tradition can fail them, but
they are also reserved with those allies because they know allies can fail them
too. When facing problems, they’re all about striking first and taking control
of the situation.</p>

<p>Shield Dwarves can replace their Dwarven Weapon Proficiency with either <strong>Shield
Dwarf Weapon Proficiency</strong> (proficient in handaxes and battle axes) or <strong>Shield
Proficiency</strong> (proficient with the light shield).</p>

<p>For a background pick, they can choose between the Dungeoneering, Endurance and
Nature skills, or the Chondathan and Giant languages (FR has a lot more
languages than core 4e).</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>FR has been around since the early days of D&amp;D, so I don’t know whether generic
D&amp;D dwarves take they traditionalism from FR ones or if it’s the other way
around. Shield dwarves are the ones most similar to those in the core.</p>

<p>The Weapon Proficienty replacements seem to be about the same (low) power level,
but Shield Proficiency is more generally useful to any non-martial PC who
normally has a hand free. Wand and orb wizards, dagger sorcerers, many monks,
and so on. An extra point of AC and Reflex always helps!</p>

<p>Cast-Iron Mind is an awesome replacement feature to take when you know you’ll be
facing a lot of psychic enemies, which includes most things with the Aberrant
origin. Spoiler alert: there’s quite a few of these in the Neverwinter campaign.</p>

</figure>

<p>The first thing I learned about the Bregan D’Aerthe is that WotC’s authors
really like them. This is an organization of mercenary drow led by this dude
named Jarlaxe Baenre, a swashbuckler that’s basically a wittier and more morally
ambiguous Drizz’t. Its members are all some sort of outcast from drow society,
such as members of fallen houses and “houseless males” (in the words of the FR
setting book). They can show up anywhere in the world and are always on the
lookout for an opportunity to turn a profit.</p>

<p>They started out as a ready source of sudden ninja attacks, but by 5e they seem
to appear in every published campaign as one of the factions in play, and even
as a possible patron for PCs. No matter where the story takes place, there’s
always a smirking drow asshole hanging in the background, ready to send your PCs
on cryptic missions and gloating that all went according to plan no matter what
the result of those missions is. Sometimes it’s Jarlaxe himself, sometimes it’s
another character.</p>

<p>This might have been the book that started the trend, and it did so in a
spectacular fashion: if you pick this theme, <em>you</em> are the smirking drow asshole
with all the secret plans.</p>

<p>Your story is pretty typical. You are a drow who survived the fall of your house
(which as usual for drow involves a massive assassination spree). The Bregan
D’Aerthe took you in and trained you, giving you a new chance to make a life for
yourself.</p>

<p>You’ve worked for them for decades, many of them here in the North’s
surface. You took part in many of the schemes that helped Luskan’s fall along,
and you witnessed the volcanic eruption. After that happened, the bulk of your
Bregan buddies left the area, since the pickings had become slim. Jarlaxe
personally ordered you to stay behind and keep an eye out in case the region
started heating up again.</p>

<p>Now that it did, you’re to look into everybody’s business, figure out what all
the factions in the are are up to, and find out how the Bregan D’Aerthe can
profit from their schemes. Jarlaxe is going to swing by some time to hear your
report and give new orders. So yeah, you’re acting as the cryptic smirking drow
“friend” to your fellow PCs while compiling a report for an even bigger cryptic
smirking NPC.</p>

<p>To be a Bregan D’Aerthe Spy, you must be a drow. You can be any class,
however. Any gender too, despite the “houseless males” bit above. The background
skills for this are Bluff, Dungeoneering, and Stealth.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>At level 1, you gain the <strong>Levitation</strong> encounter power, which is an innate
magic power few drow manage to master. As a move action, you can fly up to 4
squares up and move 1 square horizontally. You keep hovering up there for a
turn, after which you softly descend to the ground without taking falling
damage. If something else boosts you past an altitude of 4 squares while you’re
levitating, you fall to that altitude without taking damage after resolving the
effect.</p>

<p>At level 5, you gain <strong>Continuous Levitation</strong>, a daily power that when used
gives you the ability to sustain Levitation until the end of the encounter. When
you sustain it, you can move an additional 3 squares vertically and 1 square
horizontally.</p>

<p>At Level 10, when you grant combat advantage, enemies no longer gain the usual
+2 bonus to attack you. They still gain other benefits from having combat
advantage like extra damage or the ability to use specific powers, but their
attacks will be no more accurate than usual.</p>

<h2 id="optional-powers">Optional Powers</h2>

<p><strong>Sudden Stealth</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that lets you roll Stealth right
along your Initiative roll if you have any cover or concealment at the start of
combat.</p>

<p><strong>Fluid Steps</strong> is a level 6 daily power that uses a minor action and lets you
shift 3 squares as a move action for the rest of the encounter.</p>

<p><strong>Spy Sight</strong> might familiar to players of the Assassin’s Creed or Arkham
games. It’s a level 10 daily power that uses a minor action and gives you +5 to
Perception and Insight for the rest of the encounter.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I admit I’m predisposed to disliking the Bregan D’Aerthe, precisely because all
those places where they appear seem to go out of the way to picture Jarlaxe as
someone you’re supposed to love even when he betrays your party to make a few
extra gold pieces. What a card, amirite?</p>

<p>Still, I have to praise this theme for its willingness to peel back the curtain
a little and put a PC in the role of the sneaky quest giver. Remove Jarlaxe from
consideration somehow and it gets even better.</p>

<p>Mechanically, this is going to lend a roguish flair to any PC, making them more
mobile and stealthy. It works well for any mobile melee striker, but even
defenders are going to love the protection from flanking or the ability to get
up close and personal with those annoying fliers.</p>

<p>Multiple Bregan Spies in a party are possible, but too many mysterious drow in
one place can end up spoiling the mystery. A whole party of them would also end
up sticking out and having a hard time moving around undetected, unless you rule
drow make up a significant part of the general surface population in your
campaign.</p>

<p>The Spellplague was the big traumatic world event that switched Forgotten Realms
from its Third Edition to its Fourth Edition state. It’s tradition for it to
have one of those every edition change.</p>

<p>It happened nearly a hundred years before our narrative present in this book,
and it featured entire continents being pulled from a parallel dimension into
this one, fundamental and traumatic changes to the way magic worked, and yes, a
plague.</p>

<p>The plague was caused by excessive exposure to those chaotically-changing
magical energies, and it caused terrible mutations and curses in its victims. A
lot of them died, some suffered permanent disfigurations, and a rare few got
weird powers to go along with it. These people were known as the
spellscarred. The major changes subsided long ago, but there are still
occasional flareups of the Spellplague even today. Feel free to insert your
favorite COVID mismanaging jokes here, though this was written a decade before
the real-world plague.</p>

<p>In any case, if you take this background, you are one of the Spellplague’s
recent victims. You were lucky enough to be the kind that gains magical powers,
but that’s scant consolation since their initial manifestation blew up your home
and family. You spent a long time wandering alone and hiding your mutation,
because people notice they tend to treat you like, well, a plague
carrier. You’re not contagious, but good luck convincing them of that.</p>

<p>Anyway, you were eventually helped by a priest of Ilmater, the FR god of
compassion, who directed you to the city of Helm’s Hold. The god Helm died
during the original Spellplague, but his temple there has been converted into a
hospital and shelter for the spellscarred. You spent most of your journey there
trying to figure out how you contracted the plague in the first place, without
success. Now that you’re getting close to your destination, you started having
nightmares again, about the night when you changed, and about the whole world
being consumed in blue fire.</p>

<p>(These are similar to the Faithful’s dreams, but there is no divine salvation at
the end).</p>

<p>Soon there will come a time when you can no longer hide your affliction. How
will you act then? And can Helm’s Hold really help you?</p>

<p>There are no racial or class restrictions for this theme. The plague is pretty
egalitarian that way. The background skills for this theme are Arcana and Heal.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>At level 1, you get a spellscar - an obviously unnatural lesion or mutation such
as a glowing blue scar, tentacle fingers, or other such features. This gives you
a -2 penalty to defenses and saves from all Spellplague-related effects,
including attacks from spellchanged and spellscarred creatures. It also lets you
sense these creatures or Spellplague-afflicted areas if they’re within 5
squares.</p>

<p>Yes, this does mean Spellplague monsters can sense <em>you</em>, but they also get that
defense and save penalty against your attacks.</p>

<p>You also pick one of these three abilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dimensional Shift</strong>: Teleport 2 squares as a minor action once per
encounter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Twist Fate</strong>: Reroll a failed saving throw once per encounter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vanish</strong>: Once per encounter, become invisible for a turn as a minor action.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At level 5, you can draw on your spellscar to boost your attacks, even though it
hurts you. <strong>Spellscar Empowerment</strong> is a daily power that you can use when you
hit with an attack. It dazes the enemy for a turn, and deals 5 + (half your
level) damage to <em>you</em>. The price seems to be a bit steep even for a guaranteed
daze.</p>

<p>At Level 10, you get to pick a second power from the Level 1 list.</p>

<h2 id="optional-powers">Optional Powers</h2>

<p>The optional utility powers here represent an effort spent at mastering the
chaotic energies contained in your spellscar.</p>

<p><strong>Plague Disruption</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that uses a minor action. It
activates an aura 2 that lasts for a turn. Enemies inside have a -2 penalty to
attacks and “disadvantage” on power recharge rolls (i.e, they must roll the d6
twice and take the lowest result).</p>

<p><strong>Torture Reality</strong> is a level 6 daily power. If you’re targeted by a melee or
ranged attack you can use it as an interrupt to redirect the attack to a
creature adjacent to you. This can be another enemy or even an ally with better
defenses, but it can’t be the attacker.</p>

<p><strong>Morphic Recovery</strong> is a level 10 daily power that turns an enemy’s weakness
into your strength. If you hit an enemy granting combat advantage to you and
you have no encounter powers left, you can use this power to recover one of
those spent encounter powers of level 7 or lower.</p>

<p>The level restriction makes this less useful on paragon tier, since you’re going
to start gaining higher-level powers and replacing your lower-level ones. This
makes this power less useful outside of the Neverwinter campaign.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I like this more than Devil’s Pawn, as it makes for a more party-friendly edgy
secret. It’s even more FR-specific!</p>

<p>Mechanically, it’s also useful to a broader variety of characters, though I
guess each one will benefit less from it than an infernal warlock would benefit
from Devil’s Pawn.</p>
