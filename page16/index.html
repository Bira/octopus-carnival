          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/06/09/exploration-procedures.html">Dungeoncrawl Procedures at Nature Kills</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Earlier this year I published a post on “<a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/01/24/old-school-movement.html">Old School Movement</a>” with a simple
set of rules I could use when GMing converted old-school D&amp;D and AD&amp;D dungeons
in Dungeon Fantasy. Recently, the Nature Kills blog has also published <a href="https://gurpshexytime.blogspot.com/2020/06/dungeoncrawl-procedures.html">their
own take</a> on the same subject in a post titled “Dungeoncrawl Procedures”.</p>

<p>What I find most interesting on that post, and on the sources it links, is that
they see the lack of this detailed procedure in recent D&amp;D editions as a grave
omission in that system. Having a canonical procedure to crawl a dungeon or to
perform any other sort of exploration is a vital pre-requisite for properly
designing these dungeons and other places.</p>

<p>The actual procedure outlined there is similar to mine in nature, but differs in
some details and adds others I didn’t cover. The ones I found most interesting
are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This procedure should apply to all dungeon exploration, not just to AD&amp;D
adaptations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Default movement speed is double what I guessed (encumbered Move x 20m per
turn).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Traps are only sprung 2 out of 6 times. A direct translation of an old-school
mechanic that’s perfect for use when you’re not constantly using a map and
miniatures.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>They have convinced me to apply this mechanic to all dungeon crawls, but I
disagree with enough of their details that I feel I have to revise my own
procedure. That will happen some other time.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Hydras are inspired by greek mythology, which as far as I know only had the
one. In D&amp;D, I see them on the Rules Cyclopedia, which means they’ve been around
at least since the days of BECMI and probably since the beginning. They appear
in both books here.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A hydra is a giant reptilian monster, with a snake-like body and a number of
dragon-like heads. The first hydras sprang forth from the poisonous blood of
Bryakus, one of the most powerful primordials slain during the Dawn War. They
spread throughout the world and the planes and have thrived ever since. There
are many species of hydras, each with a different set of abilities and a
different number of heads. No species has less than four, though.</p>

<p>Hydras are nonsapient, but they’re still extremely dangerous predators that
require a lot of food to survive. Most species are good swimmers, and though
they can’t breathe underwater only one of the heads needs to surface to avoid
drowning. Hydras can survive on pretty much any environment as long as they have
access to food.</p>

<p>Despite their innate ferocity, hydras actually take quite well to training if
the trainer manages to survive the turbulent early stages of the
process. Giants, minotaurs and powerful spellcasters are the most frequent hydra
owners, though sometimes a hydra will “adopt” someone more unexpected than that,
like a goblin leader.</p>

<p>The mythological Hydra was notorious for its ability to regrow its severed
heads, and here we have an interesting lore divergence between the two books:
the Monster Manual describes this as a persistent rumor that has so far proved
untrue; and the Monster Vault says it’s true after all.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Both books agree hydras are threats for the paragon tier and above. They also
give all hydras trained Perception, All-Around Vision, and Darkvision. Hydras
always have a swim speed unless it goes against the theme of their specific
abilities, though they’re not Aquatic.</p>

<p>All hydras in both books have Threatening Reach, allowing them to make
opportunity attacks out to their full reach instead of just against adjacent
enemies. They also have the Many-Headed trait, which does different things in
each book. In the MM, it means that a stun or daze only causes the hydra to lose
one of its attacks on its next turn (though this stacks). In the MV, it means
the hydra can take free actions even while dazed or stunned, which is powerful
because “bite everyone in reach” is a free action for them.</p>

<p>The lore divergence above translates into a numbers divergence as well. MM
hydras have no head-severing mechanics at all, and more powerful hydras have
more heads. MV hydras always start with four heads, and lose one each at 75%,
50%, and 25% HP. At the start of the next turn after losing a head, two others
grow in its place. This increases their number of attacks, but skilled PCs might
prevent it from happening by means described in the hydra stat block.</p>

<p>MM hydras also tend to have considerably more HP for their level, since they use
the old math. That’s another thing you should fix if you want to add them to
your game.</p>

<h3 id="hydra-mv">Hydra (MV)</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Large Natural Beast with the Reptile and Water
keywords. It’s also a Level 10 Solo Brute with 432 HP and the common traits
described above. Its land speed is 5, and it swim speed 10.</p>

<p>The hydra has four heads to start with, and it lose one at 324, 216, and 108
HP. Unless it takes fire or acid damage after losing a head, it will grow two
new ones on its next turn.</p>

<p>The hydra fights by biting, and its Reach 2 bites are kinda weak to make up for
the fact that there are so many of them. The Hydra Fury at-will attack allows it
to bite once per head it currently has, gaining a damage bonus if it only has 2
or 1 left. As an at-will free action, the hydra can use two bites against anyone
who ends their movement within reach of it.</p>

<h3 id="fen-hydra-mm">Fen Hydra (MM)</h3>

<p>This is the basic hydra from the MM. It’s a Large Natural Beast (reptile) with
all common traits for MM hydras. A Level 12 Solo Brute with 620 HP, it’s
otherwise quite similar to the MV hydra, except it lacks a head-severing
mechanic. It has four heads throughout the whole fight, so its Hydra Fury always
allows it to make 4 attacks.</p>

<h3 id="flamekiss-hydra-mv">Flamekiss Hydra (MV)</h3>

<p>A fire-themed hydra, this is a Large Natural Beast (reptile) and a Level 12 Solo
Brute with 496 HP. Flamekiss hydras have a land speed of 5 and no swim speed,
but also have Resist 10 Fire. They lose heads at 372, 248 and 124 HP, and PCs
can prevent them from growing more by dealing cold or acid damage before their
next turn starts.</p>

<p>Flamekiss hydras have the same attacks as the base model, plus Flame Kiss (Close
Blast 3 vs. Reflex) which deals immediate and ongoing fire damage (save
ends). This recharges every time the hydra loses a head. It can be used in place
of a bite during a Hydra Fury combo, and benefits from the damage bonus if only
1 or 2 heads remain.</p>

<h3 id="venom-maw-hydra-mv">Venom-Maw Hydra (MV)</h3>

<p>This is the hydra that most closely resembles the mythological one, which was
all about the venom. It’s a Huge Natural Beast (reptile, water) and a Level 17
Solo Brute with 672 HP and all common hydra traits. Its land speed is 7, and its
swim speed remains 10.</p>

<p>The venom-maw hydra’s beheading thresholds are at 504, 336 and 168 HP, and it
can be prevented from regrowing heads by taking acid or fire damage before the
start of its next turn. Its Reach 3 bites deal 10 ongoing poison damage, or 20
if the hydra is bloodied (its blood is <em>also</em> poison).</p>

<p>This hydra can attack at range by spitting venom (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex), which
deals poison damage and knocks the target prone on a hit from sheer
pressure. Despite being a ranged attack, it does not provoke opportunity
attacks. Either the bite or the venomous spit can be used as attacks during a
Hydra Fury combo, with the usual damage bonus if only 1 or 2 heads remain.</p>

<p>The venom-maw hydra’s Snapping Jaws only have reach 2, which I think might be a
mistake. They should be reach 3 like its normal bites.</p>

<h3 id="mordant-hydra-mm">Mordant Hydra (MM)</h3>

<p>This Huge Natural Beast (reptile) is acid-themed. It’s a Level 18 Solo Brute
with 880 HP, Resist 15 Acid, and all common hydra traits. It has a land speed of
6 and a swim speed of 12! It also has six heads.</p>

<p>Mordant hydras fight with Reach 3 bites and Range 10 acid spit (vs. Reflex), and
its Hydra Fury allows it to make six of those attacks in any combination. All of
its other tricks come from the standard MM hydra abilities.</p>

<h3 id="primordial-hydra-mm">Primordial Hydra (MM)</h3>

<p>This one is likely one of the original hydras born from the blood of
Bryakus. It’s a Gargantuan Elemental Beast (reptile), and a Level 25 Solo Brute
with 1200 HP. It has eight heads, a land speed of 8 and a swim speed of 16,
which makes it faster than just about any other monster in the book when in
water. It has Resist 20 to Acid and Fire, and all other common hydra abilities.</p>

<p>The primordial hydra’s bite has Reach 4, and enjoys attack and damage bonuses
when used for opportunity attacks. It attacks at range with Flaming Acid Spit
(Range 10 vs. Reflex), which obviously does fire and acid damage. Its Hydra Fury
gives it eight attacks which can be any combination of those two maneuvers.</p>

<p>All of its other tricks come from the standard abilities.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have three sample encounters in the MM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 14, a fen hydra and 3 bog hags. A covey and their pet.</li>
  <li>Level 19, a mordant hydra and a gibbering abomination. No idea about this one.</li>
  <li>Level 26, 1 primordial hydra and 2 earthwind ravager elementals. A scenic
wildlife encounter for the deep Elemental Chaos.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hydras fulfill some of the same dramatic roles as dragons, since they’re giant
monsters meant to provide a memorable fight all by themselves. They’re a bit
simpler to run. They’re also nonsapient, which is a good thing because it makes
their explaining their presence in a location fairly uncomplicated. Dragons are
sapient and have agendas; hydras are just hungry.</p>

<p>I love the hydra head management mechanics they came up with for the MV, since
they’re a nice callback to the mythological Hydra and what Hercules had to do to
kill it. They also provide some subtle ways to tweak the challenge of a fight
since you could start a given hydra with more than four heads.</p>

<p>The simpler MM varieties still have their place, too, since you might not want
<em>every</em> hydra to behave like the mythological one.</p>

<p>Humans are obviously inspired by the real world, and have been an integral part
of the game since its very beginning. Humans as playable characters are covered
by the Player’s Handbook, with both of the books we’re covering having entries
for humans as opposition.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Like in pretty much every edition of D&amp;D, humans are described as being a very
diverse lot. 4e goes a bit beyond this traditional description, though, and
ascribes a few extra traits to them.</p>

<p>These mostly come from looking at humanity from the perspective of the other
races: humans are incredibly ambitious and intense, always aiming to achieve
great things in their short lifetimes. While only a few truly manage it, they
tend to leave profound marks in the world and its history. Collectively, all of
this passion has also led them to spread further than any other “civilized”
people. You can find humans in any environment, and in greater numbers than
almost anyone else. When they work together, they can easily form grand
organizations or empires that vastly outlive its individual members. Nerath is
only the most recent of those, and there’s at least one more: ancient Bael
Turath.</p>

<p>This combination of ambition and the willingness to serve causes greater than
any one individual also makes humans incredibly succeptible to corruption. When
some elves pledge allegiance to evil and move underground, it’s an event of
mythical proportions! When a group of humans does the same thing, it’s a
Tuesday. Nerath fell because it became too decadent to protect itself, and we’ll
get into what happened to Bael Turath later.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The signature human trait is that they have no signature trait! Each book has 6
stat blocks, and they have little in common aside from the words “Medium Natural
Humanoid” and their native speed of 6.</p>

<p>As it happens with all playable races, every stat block has an alignment of
“Any” or “Unaligned”, and is meant to represent either enemies or NPC allies.</p>

<h3 id="human-minions-both">Human Minions (Both)</h3>

<p>Our minions are a bunch of schlubs with clubs. They come in two power levels: 2
and 7.</p>

<p>The level 2 variety is called “Human Rabble” in the MM and “Human Goon” in the
MV. In either case they’re Minion Soldiers that have a basic club attack and a
trait named Mob Rule, hich gives them a +2 to all defenses if they have at least
two other goons are within 5 squares.</p>

<p>The Level 7 variety is called “Human Lackey” in the MM and “Human Thug” in the
MV. Lackeys are brutes and also get Mob Rule, while Thugs are skirmishers and
get Rush Into Battle: if they hit with a charge attack, their target grants
combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>Basically, if the PCs manage to rile up a classic torches-and-pitchforks mob, or
piss off a tavern-full of unsavory drunks, it will be made up of these
people. They’re also good to represent low-ranking cultists, or peasant allies.</p>

<h3 id="human-bandit-both">Human Bandit (Both)</h3>

<p>Called a “Common Bandit” in the MV, this Level 2 Skirmisher is another
classic. It has 37 HP, wears leather, and fights with a mace and a brace of
throwing daggers. It’s trained in Stealth, Streetwise and Thievery.</p>

<p>Mace attacks allow the bandit to shift 1 square on a hit. Once per encounter
they can perform a Dazing Strike that works as a mace attack and also dazes for
a turn. Finally, they deal a bit of “sneak attack” damage if they have combat
advantage.</p>

<p>Bandits are fond of ambushes and tend to retreat if bloodied. All of the usual
historical considerations about why someone would become a bandit apply here. A
large bandit gang will likely be mostly made up of Goons, with these guys
representing their veterans.</p>

<h3 id="human-guard-both">Human Guard (Both)</h3>

<p>Called a “Town Guard” in the MV, this is a Level 3 Soldier with 47 HP. Guards
wear mail (which reduces their speed to 5) and carry both halberds and light
crossbows.</p>

<p>Their basic halberd attack has Reach 2 and also marks the target for a turn on a
hit. Every so often they can make a Powerful Strike (recharge 5-6) which does
more damage and knocks prone on a hit. Their crossbows have Range 20, which is
pretty good.</p>

<p>These stats also seem appropriate for soldiers on a battlefield. In both cases a
squad made up entirely of Town Guards is a pretty versatile threat, since they
can attack both at range and in melee. It could act as a sort of “pike and shot”
unit, keeping a tight formation and marching towards the enemy. The front ranks
would wield their polearms all the way through, and the ones towards the back
would switch weapons whey the front ranks engage the enemy.</p>

<h3 id="human-berserker-mm">Human Berserker (MM)</h3>

<p>Berserkers are actually an extremely traditional “monster”, with their first
appearance being in OD&amp;D. Here, they are Level 4 Brutes with 66HP. Berserkers
run at speed 7, wear hide, and fight with axes.</p>

<p>Their greataxes are a High Crit weapon, and they can also throw handaxes if
they can’t reach someone for melee combat this turn. When first bloodied, they
use an attack named Battle Fury (free action; encounter), making a basic attack
at a +4 attack bonus and a +1d6 damage bonus.</p>

<p>As expected, they are likely to fight to the death, and their tactics can be
summed up as “Chaaaarge!”.</p>

<h3 id="human-mage-mm">Human Mage (MM)</h3>

<p>These spellcasters are Level 4 Artillery and have 42 HP. They wear robes and
wield a staff that’s nothing special in melee, and their main weapon is magic.</p>

<p>As a ranged basic attack, they can cast Magic Missiles of the kind that deal a
nice bit of force damage and require an attack roll (Ranged 20 vs. Reflex).</p>

<p>Once per encounter, they can use Dancing Lightning (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex), which
targets up to three enemies and does lightning damage.</p>

<p>Also once per encounter, they can use Thunder Burst (Area burst 1 within 10
vs. Fortitude), which deals thunder damage and dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>These wizards seem to be somewhat storm-themed, but aside from this there’s no
restriction on what sort of person they represent. You could find them as
members of a town guard, bandit gang, sinister cult, witch coven, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="human-transmuter-mv">Human Transmuter (MV)</h3>

<p>This one is actually an update of the Human Hexer from the MM2, which has a
bunch more human opponents of varied levels. It’s a more powerful spellcaster
than the MM Mage, with a transmutation theme. This Level 7 Controller has 77
HP and the usual staff and robes outfit.</p>

<p>Being a MV controller, its staff actually does respectable damage in melee. The
transmuter’s at-will ranged attack is Capricious Earth (Area Burst 2 within 5
vs. Will; enemies only) which does damage and slides the targets up to 3
squares. This is a charm effect, so I guess that it only makes the targets
<em>think</em> the earth is pushing them around.</p>

<p>The transmuter can also resort to the Beast Curse (Ranged 5 vs. Fortitude;
recharge 4-6), which turns the target into a Tiny animal like a frog or rabbit
for a turn. While thus polymorphed, the target can’t use powers or attacks.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the transmuter can Hex someone (Close Burst 5 vs. Will; one
enemy in burst). The hex lasts a turn and gives the target a -2 penalty to
attack and damage rolls against the transmuter. As a move action, the transmuter
can use Hex Jump once per encounter to switch places with a hexed target.</p>

<p>As befits a controller, the transmuter is a lot trickier than the standard
mage. Ideally it will be able to keep someone squishy locked down with Beast
Curse and use Capricious Earth to prevent the fighters from forming up
properly. Hex should be applied to someone as far away as possible to allow an
easy escape from being surrounded.</p>

<h3 id="human-duelist-mv">Human Duelist (MV)</h3>

<p>This one seems to be entirely new. Duelists are Level 8 Soldiers with 85 HP,
wearing leather and carrying a longsword.</p>

<p>Their longsword attacks mark for a turn, and Advantageous Jab allows them to
attack as an interrupt anyone who attempts to ignore the mark. Hit or miss, the
target takes a -2 penalty to their attack.</p>

<p>Duelists also have a trait named Duelist’s Poise that gives their attacks an
“immobilization for a turn” rider if they have combat advantage against the
target.</p>

<p>This stat block also looks like a good stand-in for a military officer or the
like. They combo rather well with skirmishers.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The MM gives us no less than three encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 3: 1 berserker, 2 guards, 2 spitting drakes. A guard patrol where one of
them is a loose cannon who doesn’t play by the rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 1 mage, 2 bandits, 3 gravehound zombies, 3 zombie rotters. A
necromancer and their lackeys, out for a spot of grave-robbing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 2 mages, 6 human lackeys, 1 evistro. And here’s your standard
entry-level demonic cult.</p>
  </li>

<p>Humans are of course one of the most important building blocks of any D&amp;D
setting. Sure, you can write up a setting that has no humans in it, but that’s
the sort of decision that tends to ripple outward to become one of that
setting’s main traits. They’re significant even in their absence, because
they’re pretty much everywhere else.</p>

<p>For a lot of players, a big part of the fun of playing in the Dungeon Fantasy
genre comes from the rewards their characters acquire in play. And these in
turn fall into two main categories: treasure and experience.</p>

<p>In GURPS, “experience” means Character Points, which are usually obtained for
successfully completing adventure goals and can be directly used to improve
characters. “Treasure” in a Dungeon Fantasy context can be split into magic
items and “monetary” treasure (i.e, coins and stuff you end up selling in town).</p>

<p>By default these two reward types are mostly unrelated. Going by the experience
rewards scheme on p. 92 of DF: Exploits, a party could enter a dungeon, win lots
of battles, find a secret area or three, and win plenty of experience even if
they never find a single coin’s worth of treasure.</p>

<p>Depending on the exact nature of your campaign, you might want to mess with
this reward scheme. Here are two possible ways to do that. In both, magic items
remain pretty much as written, but a stronger relationship is established
between experience and monetary treasure. They replace the standard system from
DF: Exploits entirely.</p>

<h2 id="old-school-money-is-experience">Old School: Money Is Experience</h2>

<p>When the party returns to town, add up the total value in $ of all the monetary
treasure they acquired. As usual, coins contribute their full value. Other items
contribute their sale value, but only if the PCs sell them. Those items they
decide to keep should be excluded from this calculation.</p>

<p>This total should be divided among the PCs. If your party is an anarchist
commune that keeps all money in a collective pile (like mine are!), then assume
an equal split for experience purposes. Most other parties probably also split
their take evenly, though if they’re really into that old-school vibe they might
have a complicated scheme set up that includes henchmen with half-shares,
seniority bonuses, and thieves who steal from the other PCs.</p>

<p>The PCs who survived the process of splitting the loot get to earn XP from
it. Divide each PC’s share by $500: that’s how many points they get. This is the
exact same exchange rate they’d get from converting character points to money
during character creation. Depending on how much treasure your adventures
feature, you might want to adjust the rate! For example, a PC in a campaign that
follows <a href="https://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com/2020/05/nearly-complete-thoughts-on-10x-cost.html">Petter V. Del’Orto’s suggested house rule</a> would earn one point for
every $5000 they earned.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Let’s say we have a party of 5 PCs that agree to split their loot
evenly. They meet a dragon shortly after they enter a dungeon, and are forced to
retreat having only found a small coin stash worth $1500. That comes out to $300
per PC, which is not enough for them to earn any points from this delve.</p>

<p>The PCs prepare themselves better and try again, and this time they’re able to
kill the dragon and loot its hoard, which contains $25000 in monetary treasure
and several magic items. The magic items don’t enter into this calculation, so
each PC ends up with $5000 and earns 10 character points from it.</p>

<h2 id="dungeon-souls-experience-is-money">Dungeon Souls: Experience is Money</h2>

<p>Some campaigns take place in settings where money is worthless. One example is
the Havens and Hells setting presented in Pyramid #3/89. Another is the Dark
Souls franchise. This alternate system is inspired by the latter, taking the
usual “battle experience” mechanics and making them into an in-character
concept.</p>

<p>The metaphysics of the world are such that when you defeat a monster in battle,
you siphon off a little of its life force! Depending on the setting this might
require killing the monster, but it could also involve simply defeating it in
combat and performing a small ritual.</p>

<p>In either case, people in the setting can use this accumulated “soul energy” for
all sorts of purposes, and it can be voluntarily transferred. So it becomes the
de-facto currency in a setting that has no use for mundane money.</p>

<p>The simplest way to implement this is to say that victory in battle is worth 500
“soul points” for every character point it would have been worth according to
p. 92 of DF: Exploits. This means a battle against a small amount of fodder is
worth nothing, and a big boss fight with lots of extra henchthings thrown in
might be worth 1500 SP. Again, this is the same exchange rate you use to convert
points into money during character creation, and you can vary it to suit your
preferred pace of advancement.</p>

<p>A more detailed way to model it is to use the optional rules on the <strong>It’s a
Threat!</strong> article on Pyramid #3/77, and say that a slain monster is worth soul
points equal to its Combat Effectiveness Rating. This method is a bit
math-intensive: the article has a table with values for a few published
monsters, but for anything outside of that you’ll have to calculate it.</p>

<p>No matter which method you’re using, an important decision you must make is
whether the “soul points” from a battle must be split among the PCs or if each
PC gets the full amount when the fight ends. The former setup results in much
slower advancement than the system in Exploits, while the latter more or less
keeps pace with it as far as combat experience is concerned. I do <em>not</em>
recommend fully copying Dark Souls and giving soul points from a monster only to
the PC who dealt the last blow: that works in a solo campaign, but nowhere else.</p>

<p>“Treasure” might still exist in this model in the form of dead adventurers with
residual soul points still present in their remains. This could lead to
entertaining scenes such as the party slaying a dragon and leaving its piles of
gold behind in favor of searching for the corpses of the previous parties that
failed to defeat it. And of course, if you’re using Havens and Hells then
Souls-like corpse runs are totally a thing that happens in that setting.</p>

<p>Using soul points for advancement is a matter of converting them in town using
the reverse exchange rate: 500 SP for 1 character point. They can also be used
to buy stuff, in which case 1 SP is worth $1. So characters must choose between
buying equipment or upgrading their abilities, which will end up slowing
advancement overall and making looted gear that much more desirable. A suit of
fine armor you find in the wild is one you don’t have to spend Soul Points on!</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>D&amp;D has historically featured a whole bunch of dog-like monsters in its
bestiaries, and Fourth Edition is no different. This Monster Manual entry
collects a bunch of them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The monsters in these entries are basically large dogs with various supernatural
powers, so you already have a good idea of what they look like and what they’re
used for: pets, guard animals, trackers, and so on.</p>

<p>In the implied Fourth Edition setting, mundane dogs kind of compete with drakes
in the roles I mentioned above. The supernatural powers of these monstrous
hounds make them more powerful than a typical drake, though.</p>

<p>First we have Hell Hounds, who have the ability to both resist and breathe
fire. Despite the name, they originate in the Elemental Chaos, being one of the
early creations of the primordials. Fire giants have been breeding hellhounds
for millennia, and their efforts result in larger and more powerful specimens
than can be found in the wild or in the service of less experienced breeders.</p>

<p>Next we have Shadow Hounds, native to the Shadowfell and embodying many of the
real-world myths of spooky black dogs that foretell your death or simply attack
you while you’re out in the moors.</p>

<p>And finally, we have the Hounds of the Wild Hunt, the favorite pets of those
epic-tier Eladrin and fey nobles. Their vigor is boundless, their strength
unmatched, and their intelligence super-canine.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Though the doggies in this entry are quite diverse, they do have a couple of
traits in common. They’re Medium Beasts, they generally run fast, and they have
trained Perception. Everything else varies.</p>

<h3 id="hell-hound">Hell Hound</h3>

<p>Hell hounds are Medium Elemental Beasts (fire), and Level 7 Brutes with 96
HP. They have Resist 20 Fire, run at speed 7, and are surrounded by a fiery aura
1 that does a bit of fire damage to anyone caught inside.</p>

<p>Their main attack is a bite that does a mix of physical and fire damage, and
they can also breathe fire (Close Blast 3 vs. Reflex, recharge 4-6).</p>

<p>Simple and direct creatures, you only need to fix their damage before adding
them to your game. A pack of hell hounds doesn’t need to worry about friendly
fire if they surround the PCs, and they can pair well with ranged monsters or
with other fire-resistant frontliners.</p>

<h3 id="firebred-hell-hound">Firebred Hell Hound</h3>

<p>The variety bred by fire giants is also a Medium Elemental Beast (fire), but
it’s considerably stronger: a Level 17 Brute with 205 HP. The fiery aura does a
bit more damage, its fire resistance is 40, and its ground speed 8.</p>

<p>Firebred hell hounds have the same attacks as the basic model, plus a Fiery
Burst (Close Burst 3 vs. Reflex, recharge 6) that gives then more options for
dealing area-effect fire damage.</p>

<h3 id="shadow-hound">Shadow Hound</h3>

<p>These are Medium Shadow Beasts, and Level 6 Skirmishers with 70 HP. They run at
speed 7, and have a teleport speed of 7 as well. They’re surrounded by a Shroud
of Night (aura 5) that makes all light within one step darker, and have
Vulnerable 5 Radiant. Obviously, they also have darkvision.</p>

<p>The shadow hound’s basic attack is a bite, which does extra sneak attack damage
and combat advantage if used right after the monster teleports adjacent to its
target. They can bay as a minor action (Close Burst 5 vs. Will; Fear,
sound-based; recharge 5-6) to inflict a -2 penalty to all defenses of anyone
they affect, lasting for a turn.</p>

<p>In combat they’ll keep bouncing between PCs, to get that sneak attack damage,
and will bay whenever possible to keep their defenses lowered.</p>

<h3 id="wild-hunt-hound">Wild Hunt Hound</h3>

<p>These good boys are Medium Fey Beasts, and Level 21 Skirmishers with 205
HP. They have low-light vision, speed 10 on the ground and in the air, and their
Menacing Growling acts as an Aura 10 that inflicts a -2 defense penalty to all
enemies within.</p>

<p>These hounds also get +2 defense against opportunity attacks, and cause extra
“sneak attack” damage when they have combat advantage. Their bite does even more
bonus physical damage against immobilized targets. The first time they hit, the
target is also slowed and prevented from teleporting; the next hit after that
will immobilize instead. A save can end these conditions.</p>

<p>Finally, Wild Hunt Hounds can execute a Mobile Melee Attack at will, moving 5
squares without provoking opportunity attacks and biting someone at any point
along the movement.</p>

<p>These things are terrifying when accompanied by a band of epic-level wild
hunters (like the Ghaele of Winter or equivalent fey).</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Each hound type gets a sample encounter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 2 shadow hounds, 2 shadar-kai gloomblades, 1 shadar-kai witch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 2 firebred hellhounds, 2 azer beastlords, 1 azer taskmaster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 20: 4 wild hunt hounds, 1 bralani of autumn wilds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hell hounds are a classic, and I like that they took some strong mythical
figures for the other entries. Despite the usual damage bugs the stat blocks
themselves also seem fairly simple and effective in a fight.</p>
