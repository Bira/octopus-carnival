          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2025/10/19/recap.html">Dungeon Fantasy &quot;Monster&quot;: Recap</a>
        </h1>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I’m going to write this in the same format I use for my Monster Manual Let’s
Reads, even though it’s not really a “monster”.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These plump mushrooms are a about a foot tall when fully grown, and have purple
caps. They’re very distantly related to shriekers, but their abilities are much
more specialized.</p>

<p>When someone disturbs a recap, the mushroom scans the person’s memories and
loudly summarizes the most important events of the last week or so of their
lives.</p>

<p>“Most important” here is defined by what’s foremost in the target’s minds. Yes,
they do have a tendency to spill closely held secrets that are big sources of
anxiety or regret for the victim. Some believe recaps they were originally
developed by an underground civilization with a strong tradition in psionics to
act as interrogation tools. Nowadays you can find them in the wild inside caves
and other damp and dark places, like many dungeons.</p>

<p>At least one investigator on the surface is known to carry a potted recap around
in a specially built cage, using it for its original purpose when questioning
suspects.</p>

<p>Even if the victim manages to resist the mind reading attempt, the recap
will still speak a bunch of unconnected nonsense words for a minute or so. Those
who are mainly concerned about noise should refrain from touching them at all.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Recaps aren’t “monsters” in a literal sense. Despite their radio-announcer
voices, they’re nonsapient and immobile. A good whack with any weapon will
destroy your typical recap. In GURPS, it has SM -5, DR 0, and 1 HP.</p>

<h3 id="wild-recap-cluster">Wild Recap Cluster</h3>

<p>In the wild, recaps grow in clusters and work like traps. Clusters are usually
on the ground, but might also grow on walls or ceilings. If one mushroom in the
cluster is disturbed by a touch at least strong enough to jostle it, the whole
cluster “activates” and performs its narration as one big speaker. Actual damage
also counts, of course - if a damaging attack leaves at least one recap
standing, it will activate on the next turn.</p>

<p>A recap cluster takes up 1 hex and has the following stats.</p>

<p><em>Detect</em>: Clusters are usually big enough to be plainly visible. Roll
<strong>Naturalist</strong> at -2 to identify the mushrooms as recaps.</p>

<p><em>Disarm</em>: No. Attacks that deal at least 6 damage to the whole hex at once will
completely destroy all the recaps before they can activate. Anything less will
trigger them.</p>

<p><em>Avoid</em>: <strong>DX</strong> at -5 or <strong>Light Walk</strong>. The <strong>Silence</strong> spell will render the
cluster harmless for as long as it lasts.</p>

<p><em>Save</em>: Quick Contest of <strong>Will</strong> against skill 16 to avoid having your mind
read. <strong>Magic Resistance</strong> helps.</p>

<p><em>Effect</em>: About a minute of loud noises. If the target won the contest of Will,
this will be a string of nonsense words. If they lost, the recap will summarize
the previous week of their lives as if it was the last episode of a radio
serial, potentially airing some dirty laundry.</p>

<p><em>Shots</em>: Constant.</p>

<p><em>Rearm</em>: No.</p>

<p><em>Steal</em>: Roll against <strong>Naturalist</strong> to harvest one large, healthy recap
specimen per hex. This weights 1 lb. and is worth $1000 if delivered intact to
the right people back in town.</p>

<h3 id="recap-inquisitor">Recap Inquisitor</h3>

<p>This consists of a large, healthy recap specimen planted on good soil in a clay
pot, surrounded by small but sturdy iron cage with large gaps between the
bars. It’s used by the “right people” back in town or by unscrupulous villains
in interrogations. They just need to ask (or force) the subject to poke the
mushroom.</p>

<p>The subject must win a quick contest of <strong>Will</strong> against a skill of 16 to
prevent the ‘shroom from narrating all their dirty laundry from the past seven
days. It will speak a string of nonsense words if the subject resists, and
experienced handlers will know what that means. The cage offers DR 7 against
swinging attacks and other impacts (such as dropping the device), but the large
gaps mean it doesn’t protect against thrusting ones.</p>

<p>Recap Inquisitors cost $2000 and weight 10 lbs. Monthly maintenance requires
$100 in supplies and success in a <strong>Naturalist</strong> roll to keep the ‘shroom alive.</p>

<h2 id="additional-notes">Additional Notes</h2>

<p>I put in the same resistance mechanics for the two entries but I think they’re
mostly relevant for an interrogation scenario. When you step onto a recap patch
in the wild it’s probably funnier if they just succeed and narrate your last
week. It might even be fun to have the PC’s player do the narration if they’re
so inclined.</p>

<p>I say this because in my experience PCs rarely have something to hide from each
other, so there wouldn’t be really any dirty laundry that they didn’t want
aired. Of course, if you your group <em>is</em> a party of sneaky gits who do keep
important secrets from each other, then you should probably keep the resistance
test in place.</p>

    A silt horror devouring a group of adventurers.

</figure>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, the only sea most Athasians know is the Sea of Silt. The
name here is pretty descriptive - an endless expanse of silvery dust that makes
up the eastern “border” of the Tyr Region. You can sail on it using special
vessels, and its depths conceal many ruins of extinct civilizations, as well as
an extensive ecosystem that’s a mystery to most surfacers.</p>

<p>Those who have more experience with the Sea of Silt might know of the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2025/06/10/wir-dscc-floating-mantle.html">Floating
Mantles</a> who sometimes wander into land, but the thing they fear the most is
the aptly named Silt Horror. These enormous beasts are more or less Darker and
Sunnier krakens, emerging from the deep to wrestle entire ships with their
grasping tentacles and devour them with their bottomless maws.</p>

<p>And that’s for the “basic” version that appears close to shore, the one with
white tentacles. Silt sailors who have ventured further away from shore come
back with stories about horrors with brown or gray tentacles who are even
larger - some of them larger than entire city-states. Are these tales true? Who
knows? It’s not like it’s easy to fact-check them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We only get the “basic” white-tentacled silt horror here. The bigger versions,
if they exist, are left as an exercise for the GM. Unlike a standard D&amp;D Kraken,
the silt horror is not sapient, but that doesn’t make it less dangerous.</p>

<p>The creature is so large that we get a stat block for the main body and a couple
of different stat blocks for its tentacles, which act like minions and
regenerate fast enough to keep coming back in the same fight after being
“slain”.</p>

<h3 id="silt-horror">Silt Horror</h3>

<p>The main body of the creature is a Huge Aberrant Beast and a Level 12 Solo
Lurker with 496 HP. It has a ground speed of 2 and a burrow speed of 6 on soft
earth, which is like a swim speed on the Sea of Silt. It’s Blind, and therefore
immune to the blinded conditions and to all gaze attacks. It perceives the world
via Termorsense 20.</p>

<p>The horror’s main trait covers its <strong>Regenerating Tentacles</strong>. Any time when the
horror has less than 4 tentacles within 20 squares of itself, a number of new
tentacles appear until it has 4. The horror chooses which types they are from
the three available (constricting, raking, sweeping). They appear above ground
even if the main body is burrowing, and act on their own initiative, rolled when
they appear.</p>

<p>The main body itself has a fairly basic <strong>Bite</strong> attack, but the star of the
show here is the <strong>Chomping Maw</strong> maneuver, which deals almost double the damage
and can target up to two creatures. The restriction here is that the main body
must be entirely underground to attack, and the targets must be grabbed by
tentacles.</p>

<p>As a move action, it can <strong>Submerge</strong>, burrowing its way to a space that’s
entirely underground. This recharges whenever it’s on the surface, so it’s more
or less at will. And when one of its tentacles is reduced to 0 HP with a melee
attack, it can make a free melee attack of its own before disappearing, dealing
10 extra damage and pushing the triggering PC 5 squares instead of grabbing
them.</p>

<h3 id="silt-horror-tentacles">Silt Horror Tentacles</h3>

<p>All three tentacle types are very similar to each other, so we’ll cover them
in the same entry.</p>

<p>First, the common traits: all three are Level 12 Minions. They have ground and
burrow speeds of 6, and act as sensory organs with the same Tremorsense 20 as
the main body. They’re obviously <strong>Attached</strong> to the silt horror and cannot be
more than 20 squares from the main body. They’re also <strong>Unhindered</strong>, which as
we know means they can pull any grabbed victims along with them when they move.</p>

<p>All three tentacles have a basic <strong>Seize</strong> attack, which deals physical damage
and grabs the victim. The stats that vary between the three types are their
creature roles, and what they can do with a grabbed victim using their second
attack.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Constricting</strong> tentacles are Soldiers and their <strong>Constricting Grab</strong>
damages and dazes the victim for a turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Raking</strong> tentacles are Skirmishers and their <strong>Sweeping Grab</strong> damages and
slides the victim 3 squares to a space adjacent to the tentacle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sweeping</strong> tentacles are Brutes and their <strong>Suffocating Grab</strong> damages and
knocks prone.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Even after the special attacks, the victims remain grabbed - use the standard
rules to try to get away.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Silt Horrors will most likely be found alone. They’re not sapient so they don’t
form alliances, and they’re impossible to tame. At most you might find them
already fighting another victim, such as a different ship, or a giant who was
wading through the Sea. These fellow targets might be friendly to the PCs, or
they might not.</p>

<p>Another possibility is an horror intruding upon an already ongoing fight against
those other ships or giants…</p>

<p>The mechanics here are very interesting. The tentacles want to grab as many
victims as possible and do nasty things to them while bringing them closer to
the main body’s location. The main body wants to stay underground until two
victims are in reach, use Chomping Maw on them, and then use Submerge to get
away again. As long as at least one PC remains grabbed, the horror could do this
every turn.</p>

    green carapace, and whose grinning mouth is about three times as wide as its
    head.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Silk Wyrms are snakelike monsters covered in chitinous carapaces. They’re gifted
with many natural weapons: bites laced with paralytic venom and the psionic
powers of flight, camouflage, and mesmerism.</p>

<p>Though incapable of communicating in humanoid languages they’re tenacious
endurance predators who employ clever hunting strategies.</p>

<p>Silk Wyrms will shadow their intended prey for days, looking for a time when its
guard is down. The book is not too specific about the nature of this prey. It
could be an adventuring party, a traveling caravan with humanoids and several
kinds of pack animal, or something like a pack of baazrags or other wild
animals. What matters is that the prey is easy to hunt and can be eaten “fresh”,
because silk wyrms apparently only eat their victims while they’re alive, and
abandon them when they die.</p>

<p>When their intended targets are vulnerable, the silk wyrm will sneak in,
paralyze a chosen victim, and devour them on the spot. If it manages to
incapacitate more than one victim it will drag one of them to its nest, where it
will trap them in silk strands and eat them over the course of the next few days
while they’re still alive.</p>

<p>Silk wyrms band together as hatchlings, but as soon as they reach the adult
stage their deeply antisocial instincts take over and they set off on their own
to become lone hunters. Only after many years do they become wise enough to
overcome this instinct and start allying with other creatures. Some manage to
lead bands of their own younger kin, while others can ally with those creatures
whose telepathy allows them to communicate with the wyrms and buy their service
with easy food.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Silk Wyrms are Natural Magical Beasts with the Reptile tag and Low-Light
Vision. All silk wyrms have a flight speed, but their flight is Clumsy, which
means they have a -4 penalty to attacks and defenses while on the air. This
means silk wyrms only fly to travel, but they prefer to fight on the ground.</p>

<p>We’ll look at their other traits in each stat block below.</p>

<h3 id="silk-wyrm-hatchling">Silk Wyrm Hatchling</h3>

<p>Too frail to set out on their own, hatchlings roam the wastes in bands,
spreading out to scout for prey and emitting a loud chirping noise when they
find it to call their clutch-mates. They’re Medium-sized Level 3 Minion
Skirmishers, with ground and flight speeds of 6.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Blood Scent</strong> trait means their attacks against bloodied creatures
ignore concealment. These will mostly be <strong>bites</strong> that deal poison damage and
slow for a turn. When the hatchling hits 0 HP, they release <strong>Silk Strands</strong> as
a last attack, which deal a bit of acid damage and restrain (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="silk-wyrm-adult">Silk Wyrm Adult</h3>

<p>In their “lone hunter” phase, adults are Large-sized Level 3 Solo Skirmishers
with 174 HP. Their flight speed increases to 8, but remains clumsy.</p>

<p>Adults retain <strong>Blood Scent</strong>, which works exactly the same way. They will
likely start the encounter in <strong>Shadow Form</strong> (minor, recharges when first
bloodied), which makes Insubstantial with Phasing and gives them +5 to Stealth
while stopping it from attacking. It can get out of this with a free action, and
will do so shortly after springing its ambush.</p>

<p>Once the wyrm appears in the middle of its targets, and again whenever the power
is charged, it will use <strong>Mesmerizing Dread</strong> (minor, recharge 4+), which deals
psychic damage to enemies in a Close Burst 5, slides them 3 squares, and
inflicts a -2 penalty to all defenses for a turn. Then it’s bite time.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bites</strong> deal more poison damage, since they’re not minions, and their
venom becomes stronger. The target is slowed (save ends), which worsens to
immobilized (save ends) on the first save and to helpless (save ends) on the
second failure. <strong>Wyrm Strike</strong> lets it bite two different targets with one
action.</p>

<p>Helpless is a funny and very worrying condition. It’s funny because going
strictly by the book, you can move and act normally while Helpless. However
you’re never <em>just</em> Helpless. The most common way to get this condition is to be
unconscious. In this case, even on a strict reading you’ll still be Restrained
when you fail your second save and become Helpless.</p>

<p>Being Helpless is worrying because it makes the victim grant combat advantage,
and opens them up to the Coup de Grace action, which is an attack with any
applicable power that auto-crits and kills the target outright if it deals more
than their bloodied value in damage.</p>

<p>If the Silk Wyrm manages to get someone immobilized, restrained, or helpless, it
will <strong>Feed</strong> on them, attacking their Fortitide eating one of their healing
surges, and healing 10 HP. There’s no damage other than this, apparently, which
makes this attack a lot more forgiving in a fight than it would otherwise seem.</p>

<p>It someone hits the adult wyrm with a melee or close attack, it can respond with
<strong>Silk Strands</strong> as a reaction. This is a melee 3 attack vs. Reflex, dealing
acid damage and restraining on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="silk-worm-elder">Silk Worm Elder</h3>

<p>Elders have lived long enough to learn the value of teamwork despite or perhaps
<em>because</em> of the loss of their ability to project silk strands in combat. They
band together with one another or with other powerful allies in order to survive
and keep eating. They’re Level 14 Skirmishers with 125 HP. Not being solos, they
don’t have a blanked +5 on all saves, but they still have that bonus on saves
against Immobilized or Slowed.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Form</strong> and <strong>Mesmerizing Dread</strong> work exactly the same, with Shadow
Form just making the wyrm Weakened instead of preventing attacks entirely. They
can only <strong>bite</strong> once per turn but their venom remains as potent as the
adult’s.</p>

<p>The problem here is the damage: both Mesmerizing Dread and the basic bite do
exactly the same damage as the adult’s, which is way, way below what it should
be for a level 14 monster.</p>

<p><strong>Feed</strong>, on the other hand, does a huge chunk of physical damage (5d10+6) in
addition to deleting a healing surge. It recharges when first bloodied instead
of being at-will, but it no longer has any target restictions. They still really
want to use this in a helpless target if they can, because it’s going to kill
any helpless target with 112 maximum HP or less.</p>

<p>Still, outside of their one or two uses of Feed, elders are significantly less
scary. The venom is still a concern, particularly if they have heavy hitters
with them, but barring errata it seems to me elders were made to rush in, use
Feed once or twice, and escape the fight using Shadow Form and <strong>Serpent
Strike</strong>, which they still have.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think the Lore section outlines possible silk wyrm encounters pretty well.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the first two seem okay to me, but the elder is weird. The damage
of their bites and Mesmerizing stare needs a buff. It’d make them more
consistently dangerous despite making their Feed attack a little less impressive
in comparison (as its 28 average damage is not a lot higher than the 22 their
bites would need).</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>This wouldn’t be a proper D&amp;D monster book without at least one vile seductress
that tries to lure in unsuspecting adventurers with her womanly wiles.</p>

<p>Sand Brides are basically Darker and Sunnier Nymphs. More specifically, they are
the things this world’s surviving nymphs turned into when the ecosystem went to
shit and the Feywild was mostly destroyed. Like a lot of other Athasian fey,
they blame all intelligent natural creatures for their corrupted state, and try
to victimize them as an act of vengeance.</p>

<p>Their preferred tactic is to build traps and ambush spots out in the desert and
use their illusion powers to disguise them as safe places like oases, sheltering
ruins, or caravan rest stops. Then they disguise themselves as harmless
humanoids and try to lure their targets to the ambush. The illustration and some
of the descriptions imply these “harmless humanoids” are pretty ladies, but they
don’t have to be.</p>

<p>Once the victims are at the intended spot, the ambush is sprung, and the sand
bride will use her sand-bending powers and dehydrating touch to kill the
victims, leaving only dried husks behind.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Sand Brides are Medium Fey Humanoids and Level 10 Elite Controllers with an even
200 HP. Despite being living beings they have Darkvision and are immune to
disease and poison, traits commonly found in undead. Their ground speed is 8,
and they have a burrow speed of 6. This <em>doesn’t</em> say it’s for loose earth only,
so they could theoretically tunnel through rock.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Sandform Body</strong> lets them ignore all difficult terrain, tough they’re
less diffuse than the dune constructs we saw previously. They attack in melee
with a <strong>Dehydrating Touch</strong> that deals necrotic damage and inflicts -2 to all
defenses for a turn on a hit. At range, they use <strong>Sand Blasts</strong> that deal
physical damage and push 4 squares. <strong>Double Attack</strong> lets them make two melee
attacks per action.</p>

<p>They can also employ a <strong>Sand Drown</strong> power (recharge 5+) if the PCs bunch up
too much. This is an Area 1 Within 10 attack, dealing heavy physical damage and
restraining on a hit.</p>

<p>Its ability to create illusory terrain is weaponized as an <strong>Insidious Mirage</strong>
(Encounter), which lets the Sand Bride create a zone 4 squares on a side that
lasts until the end of the encounter. This counts as difficult terrain for
enemies, lets the bride slide enemies who end their turns inside by up to 2
squares as a free action, and can be moved by up to 4 squares as minor action.</p>

<p>And finally they have <strong>Deceptive Veil</strong>, allowing them to appear as a humanoid
of any species. Piercing the illusion requires an Insight contest against the
bride’s Bluff skill of +15. This doesn’t <em>have</em> to be a pretty lady, but it’s
apparently traditional. The bride’s stats remain the same while disguised, and
she can attack without dropping the illusion.</p>

<p>Sand brides target groups of travelers The creatures are fairly social with each
other and will organize in groups. They can probably ally with other fey too, or
have some Athasian beasts under their control ready to attack.</p>

<p>I’m not overly fond of vile seductress monsters but sand brides seem easy to
reskin into something less cliche while keeping the same tactics.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These creatures were known as so-ut in olden times, but most people found that
name wasn’t very descriptive, so now they’re known as Rampagers. And they do
what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>True, that doesn’t narrow it down by a lot given that we just looked at
Nightmare Beasts, which are also big rampaging monsters. But there are some
important differences: Nightmare Beasts are hateful monsters twisted by the
energies of the Gray who hate all living things; Rampagers are hateful monsters
twisted by vengeful primal spirits who hate all artifice.</p>

<p>Sure, they’ll kill anything that gets in their way, but the thing they really
hate are buildings and other constructed signs of civilization. The cloud of
angry elementals that constantly surrounds these creatures fills them with rage
and drives them to seek these things out and utterly destroy them with their
acidic claws. Ruins or new buildings, it doesn’t matter. They will all be razed
to their foundations.</p>

<p>Those who can’t take on a Rampager in direct combat (i.e, most Athasians) might
have a chance to avoid a deadly confrontation by placating the immaterial
spirits that surround the creature via rituals or diplomacy, convincing them to
direct their weapon elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>A Rampager is a Large Elemental Beast and a Level 21 Solo Brute with 800 HP. It
has Darkvision and a ground speed of 7.</p>

<p>The angry spirits surrounding the so-ut aren’t modeled as separate creatures and
cannot be targeted in combat, but I think they might be the source of its
<strong>Entropic Presence</strong> aura (2), which <em>strips immunities and resistances</em> from
all creatures and objects within. I believe that does include most of the
inherent immunities objects have (such as to poison and necrotic damage).</p>

<p>The Rampager also has two other passive traits: <strong>Destruction’s Storm</strong> boosts
its damage while bloodied, and <strong>Soul of Destruction</strong> boosts it even more
against constructs, objects, and structures.</p>

<p>Its active attacks start with acid-laced Reach 2 <strong>Claws</strong>, which deal a hearty
blend of physical and acid damage and penalize AC by -1 until the end of the
encounter on a hit. This accumulates to a maximum of -5. And to top it off they
have the High Crit property.</p>

<p>The <strong>Bite</strong> is Reach 2 and targets Reflex, and seems weak at first, but that’s
just the primary attack. If that hits, the creature makes a secondary attack
against the target’s Fortitude, which weakens and inflicts 30 ongoing poison
damage on a hit (save ends). Entropic Presence makes this as effective against
structures and objects as it would be against flesh and blood enemies.</p>

<p>Our last attack is the one that gives the Rampager its name: <strong>Destructive
Rampage</strong> is an at-will power that lets it make three claw and one bite attack
in any order. At most 2 attacks can be directed at the same target, and the
monster can shift 2 squares after each one as an effect.</p>

<p>When the Rampager is first bloodied, and again when it drops to 0 HP, it can use
Destructive Rampage as a free action.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Overall I wasn’t as impressed by the Rampager’s lore since it comes right after
the Nightmare Beast and the Psurlon, but it’s very in theme for Athas. You could
also easily reskin it as a sort of tarrasque spawn, since both follow similar
themes.</p>

<p>Mechanically, I think all the mechanics that combine to make it a menace against
constructs and structures are really cool. I can easily see an adventure where
PCs must somehow direct a rampager to fight something like the Dark Sun version
of the Wandering Tower (originally from Threats to the Nentir Vale). And of
course, if this thing ever meets a Nightmare Beast meet, they’re going to fight,
and while the Rampager as written might not win that one without PC help it can
serve as an important distraction.</p>

<p>The book clearly intends for Rampagers to be found alone, since as mentioned
above the spirit cloud is more of an special effect than a separate creature,
mechanically. Nothing stops you from adding some actual epic level elementals to
the encounter if your PCs are higher level, though.</p>
