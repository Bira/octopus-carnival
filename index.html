<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<p>Athas has no mundane Earth animals. Instead of wolves or dogs, you get these
things.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Baazrags are beetle-lizard things the size of large dogs. In their natural
environment, they’re desert predators organized in large but loose packs. Pack
members stick close to each other but most fend for themselves, feeding on weeds
and small animals and accumulating water in a sac under their shell. When one of
them detects large prey it alerts the others, and the entire pack works together
for the big meal ticket.</p>

<p>All baazrags are born female, but only a few manage to reach the right size,
age, and biochemical triggers to become egg-laying breeders. When a breeder is
present, some of the other baazrags will become male, and will help fertilize
and defend the eggs. Breeders and other powerful baazrags have some innate
psychic sensitivity - proximity to psychic characters irritates them, making
them more hostile.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Bazraags are Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag. Like most monster tags, it
does nothing by itself but some effects may key off it. Most specimens are
Medium, but Whelps are Small and breeders are Large. Their signature trait is
<strong>Pack Harrier</strong>, a passive trait which gives them combat advantage against any
target surrounded by two or more of their allies. They have a ground speed of 8,
so good lock outrunning them when they find you.</p>

<h3 id="baazrag-whelp">Baazrag Whelp</h3>

<p>Baazrags are capable of fighting from the moment they hatch, but they’re still
too vulnerable to strike out on their own and so stick close to their
mother. When they grow up a little more, they join the other members of the pack
in their semi-independent activities.</p>

<p>Whelps are Level 1 Minion Skirmishers with the signature traits mentioned above,
plus the <strong>Scrambler</strong> trait that lets them ignore difficult terrain when they
shift. Their <strong>bite</strong> does the kind of damage you’d expect from a Level 1
Minion, which isn’t anything spectacular.</p>

<h3 id="baazrag-gnawer">Baazrag Gnawer</h3>

<p>A particularly tenacious hunter that strays a bit further from the pack to act
as a scout. It’s usually the first to spot large prey and warn its companions,
and when it bites down it doesn’t let go.</p>

<p>Gnawers are Level 1 Skirmishers with 29 HP and all the standard traits. It also
has the <strong>Latcher</strong> trait, which gives it +2 AC when it’s latched onto a victim
(see below).</p>

<p>The gnawer’s <strong>Bite</strong> does a lot of work here. It deals standard damage on a hit
and lets the creature latch onto the target, which works like a custom status
effect. While the gnawer is latched on a target, it moves when the target moves,
without provoking opportunity attacks, and can stop at any unoccupied square
adjacent to the target at the destination. It can obviously only latch onto one
creature at a time.</p>

<p>While the gnawer is latched, it can use the <strong>Gnaw</strong> attack, which on a hit
deals heavy physical damage, ongoing 5 poison (save ends) and lets the creature
detach and shift 2 squares.</p>

<p>The main difference between having a gnawer attached and being grabbed is that
the target is not immobilized. Therefore, even though the stat block doesn’t say
it, I’d let PCs treat it like a grab for purposes of escaping it early. On the
other hand, while a gnawer can only grab one target, <em>multiple</em> gnawers can
attach to the same target. Don’t let it happen!</p>

<p>Finally, as a move action, the gnawer can use <strong>Bounder</strong> to jump 4 squares
without provoking opportunity attacks. This is at-will, so it’s a very slippery
creature if you don’t have a fighter with you.</p>

<h3 id="baazrag-swarm">Baazrag Swarm</h3>

<p>One whelp is nearly harmless, but the whole litter at once is bad news. This
is a Medium swarm, counting as a Level 3 Soldier with 46 HP. They have the usual
swarm resistances: half damage from melee and ranged attacks, vulnerable 5
against close and area attacks.</p>

<p>Like all Swarms, this one can occupy the same space as its enemies, and its area
counts as difficult terrain. It cannot be pushed, pulled or slid by melee or
ranged attacks, and can squeeze past any opening big enough for an individual
member without penalty. In this case, the members are probably Small. It also
has Pack Harrier, and a <strong>Hinder</strong> aura (1) that slows enemies who start their
turns inside. Being inside the swarm also counts as being inside the aura,
obviously.</p>

<p>Their basic melee attack is <strong>Bloodthirsty Swarm</strong>, which deals extra damage
against prone targets. Their other attack is of course <strong>Pull Down</strong>, which
damages and knocks prone on a hit.</p>

<p>These things are <em>slightly</em> less dangerous <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2020/01/27/drakes.html">needlefang drake swarms</a>. They’re
higher level and do more base damage, but their aura doesn’t give them
additional free attacks against prone targets. This means they will probably
leave incapacitated PCs alone while other enemies remain in the map, though
those would still be fair game if nothing else is in reach.</p>

<h3 id="baazrag-breeder">Baazrag Breeder</h3>

<p>A typical baazrag who managed to grow and develop the ability to lay eggs. It’s
Large in size, and a Level 5 Brute with 77 HP. I’m guessing not every old-enough
baazrag will reach this state - it might be something related to hormones, like
in an insect hive.</p>

<p>The breeder upgrades her Pack Harrier trait to <strong>Pack Master</strong>, and only needs
one other adjacent ally to gain Combat Advantage against a target. She can
attack with a basic <strong>Claw</strong> attack or with a <strong>Bite</strong> that deals bonus damage
against prone targets and inflicts ongoing 5 poison (save ends) on a hit.</p>

<p>She also has psychic powers! <strong>Psychic Lure</strong> is a minor action Close Burst 5
vs. Will that targets one enemy and pulls them 3 squares on a hit. And that
irritability when near other psychic sources translates into the <strong>Psychic
Provocation</strong> reaction, which lets the breeder immediately charge anyone who
deals psychic damage to her once per turn.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Baazrags look like typical random encounters during wilderness travel, but
depending on how the PCs are doing in their trek they could also seek the
creatures out to harvest their water sacs and meat.</p>

<p>The first sign of a baazrag pack is the lone scout that will make an effort to
call its buddies when it finds the party. Then they’ll swarm the prey and try to
pull it down for the kill, but will give up if they think the prey is too tough
and the fight is going against them.</p>

<p>Breeders, if present, stay a bit further away and try to lure a lone victim with
Psychic Lure. If they manage it, they’ll attack the isolated PC with the help of
any nearby young.</p>

<p>Individual adult Baazrags could all be represented by gnawers, though you could
also reskin Gray Wolves from the Monster Vault as other baazrag adults. Any and
all of these might be found as members of humanoid encounter groups as guard and
war animals, just like the beasts they replace.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<p>I have no idea if anakores appeared before. This is the first time I’ve read
about them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Little is known about the origins of these creatures. Ancient tales speak of a
terror from beyond the sky that touched their humanoid ancestors, causing them
to recoil from the sun and seek shelter underground. Over time, these ancestors
became today’s anakores.</p>

<p>Anakores live in small hunter-gatherer bands led by their most accomplished
tracker. They burrow beneath the desert sands during the day, and from there
they can feel the vibrations of prey passing overhead, and smell blood spilled
on the ground. When anakores detect prey, they can follow it all day by
tunneling through the sands, waiting until nightfall to spring their ambush from
below. Then they will fight with their powerful digging claws and their
paralytic bites.</p>

<p>While on the move, the creatures subsist on plant roots, including certain
poisonous species that help the formation of their venom. Rootless vegetation
spread around an area is a possible signt of anakore presence, though they’re
smart enough to clean this up if they intend to stay in place for a while.</p>

<p>Different band members specialize in different parts of an attack - some lead
the ambush, others strike to hurt and incapacitate victims, and yet others drag
those victims underground.</p>

<p>I guess a lot of the time they prey on the local fauna, but anakores don’t mind
attacking sapient travellers, and judging from what the book says seem to prefer
it. They don’t have any visible sexual dimorphism, and rumor has it that they
reproduce by dragging some of their sapient victims to weird cocoons under the
sands. There, the victims are transformed into more anakores. No one knows what
criteria they use to select new candidates.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Anakores are Medium Aberrant Humanoids, which means they’re sapient. They have
low-light vision and Tremorsense 5, plus a ground speed of 5 with Earth Walk and
a burrow speed of 6 on loose earth only. They communicate in Deep Speech.</p>

<p>Their signature traits are <strong>Dune Diver</strong>, which lets them charge while
burrowing, and <strong>Sensitive to Light</strong>, which gives them a -2 penalty to attacks
for a turn when they’re exposed to direct sunlight or take radiant damage.</p>

<p>Their poison is a rider on a different attack on every stat block, but the
effect is always the same: the target is slowed on a hit (save ends), worsening
to immobilized (save ends) after the first failed save.</p>

<h3 id="anakore-hunter">Anakore Hunter</h3>

<p>These are the ones who drag people under. They’re Level 5 Lurkers with 48
HP. Their basic <strong>claw</strong> attacks grab the target on a hit, and on their next
turn they can choose to either bite the victim or drag them under.</p>

<p>The <strong>bite</strong> targets a grabbed creature and deals a bit less damage than the
claws, but applies the poison described above. <strong>Drag Under</strong> (melee 1
vs. Fortitude) can target either immobilized or grabbed creatures. It deals more
damage than the claw, inflicts 5 ongoing damage and removes the target from play
(save ends both). When the effect ends the target reappears at its previous
position or on the closest unoccupied square. And even them they’re still
immobilized (save ends), so the hunter can try to drag them under again right
away instead of having to bite.</p>

<p>Presumably, victims who drop to 0 HP by this attack would be dragged further
down and not come back up. Don’t let that happen!</p>

<h3 id="anakore-render">Anakore Render</h3>

<p>This is the one that hurts the prey and makes it more vulnerable to the
others. Renders are Level 7 Brutes with 96 HP and a ground speed of 7 instead
of the usual 5.</p>

<p>Their <strong>claws</strong> do heavy damage on a hit, pushing the target 2 squares and
knocking it prone. Their <strong>blood frenzy</strong> ablity (recharge 5+) lets them perform
two of these attacks in one action.</p>

<p>As a move action, they can use <strong>Blood Hunger</strong> to shift 3 squares closer to a
bloodied creature. As a minor action, they can use a <strong>rending bite</strong> against a
prone or bloodied creature, which does light physical damage and applies anakore
venom.</p>

<h3 id="anakore-dune-king">Anakore Dune King</h3>

<p>Often the leaders of a pack, Dune Kings signal the start of an attack by
bursting up from the ground in the middle of their targets and distracting them
so their fellows can attack the victims more safely. They’re Level 9 Skirmishers
with 94 HP and the Leader tag.</p>

<p>Their <strong>claws</strong> damage and apply anakore poison on a hit, but the real threat
here is the <strong>Sand Eruption</strong> ability (recharge 5+). The dune king must be
underground to start this, and the action lets him move 4 squares to a square
that’s not underground. The first time they enter such a square, they can
perform a Close Burst 2 attack that targets enemies and deals very heavy
physical damage on a hit, sliding the targets 2 squares. Additionally, each
anakore in the burst can shift 3 squares as a free action, and the area of the
burst becomes difficult terrain until the end of the encounter.</p>

<p>Finally, Dune Kings can shift 1 square as a minor action using <strong>Sand Slide</strong>,
which makes them as slippery as kobolds despite their size.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Anakore bands only hunt in places where they can burrow, which means the terrain
on the map will mostly be soft earth, sand, or silt. An anakore-only encounter
is the most common one, I think, but they can also appear with other burrowing
predators that they either trained, or which happen to be opportunistically
hanging around.</p>

<p>They can also work with other sapients that pay them in food and trinkets for
doing what they were already going to do anyway, and you might also find them
in bizarre aberrant ruins on or under the surface, drawn there by strange dreams
and performing unspeakable rituals.</p>

<p>Anakores are smart enough to recognize when they’re in a poor situation, and
when they should negotiate instead of fighting. But if they think they should
fight, their underground ambushes can be pretty terrifying, as all of their
powers synergize very well and make the tactics described in the lore section
very effective.</p>

<p>Their burrow speed lets them go back underground at will, meaning each Dune King
might be able to perform more than one Sand Eruption in a fight, and the Hunters
can move with relative impunity among the party to harass and grab the
PCs. Renders stay up top once they emerge, and all of them are immune to the
difficult terrain created by the Kings due to Earth Walk.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<p>As far as I know Aarakocra first show up on the 1e Fiend Folio as relatively
peaceful and good-natured bird people. They’re like that in most of their
appearances, but just like with all everything else about this setting the
Athasian version is Darker and Sunnier(TM).</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Here, Aarakocra are vulture-people, who band together in insular tribes for
survival in the harsh wastelands of Athas. They just want to be left alone to do
their own thing, but are understandably mistrustful of outsiders in a setting
full of slavers and sorcerer-kings. Each tribe claims a territory, and fiercely
defends it. Their settlements are built atop desert mesas and other high places,
and they use these vantage points to survey their territory for food and
intruders.</p>

<p>Foreigners traveling through a tribe’s territory will be approached by the
aarakocra, who demand tribute in exchange for safe passage. Those who pay are
guided to safer paths or useful landmarks. The aarakocra attack those parties
who refuse, trying to kidnap some of their members for ransom. Some large
merchant houses make deals with the more powerful tribes, paying protection fees
in advance to avoid harassment from both the paid off tribe and any weaker ones
that might lie along the route.</p>

<p>Aarakocra have a long tradition of reverence for primal spirits of the wind and
sun. Many of them display the ability to cast primal spells, and they know
rituals to summon air elementals and other spirits.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Aarakocra are Medium Natural Humanoids (take that, Aristotle!). They have
low-light vision, ground speeds of 5, and fly speeds of 6. Their signature power
is <strong>Sly Takeoff</strong>, a move action that lets them shift 1 square and then fly 5
squares. It’s very useful for disengaging from melee.</p>

<h3 id="aarakocra-diver">Aarakocra Diver</h3>

<p>Braver than most of their kin, these warriors like to fly high and dive at their
targets from an angle that leaves the sun at their backs, making it difficult
for the victim to spot them until it’s too late. They’re Level 6 Skirmishers
with 66 HP.</p>

<p>Divers fight in the traditional aarakocra style, gripping a Reach 2
<strong>longspear</strong> in their prehensile feet while flying. “Brave” doesn’t mean
stupid, so they do everything they can to avoid getting bogged down in ground
combat.</p>

<p>Their most likely maneuver is a <strong>Flyby Attack</strong>, where they can move 6 squares,
and make a longspear attack against a target anywhere along the movement. If the
target grants combat advantage to the diver, the diver can also make a <strong>bite</strong>
attack as a minor action for a little extra bit of damage.</p>

<p>They can also make a more powerful <strong>Diving Charge</strong> (recharge 4+), which lets
them charge and make an extra strong longspear attack that also knocks prone on
a hit. They’ll likely need to use <strong>Sly Takeoff</strong> to move away afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="aarakocra-warrior">Aarakocra Warrior</h3>

<p>The typical vulture-folk warrior is not as mobile or brave as the diver, relying
on strength of numbers. They descend from the sky and try to stay just high
enough off the ground to stab with their spears.</p>

<p>Warriors are Level 6 Minion Skirmishers that fight with reach 1 <strong>Spears</strong> which
do an extra point of damage on a charge. So they still want to charge in and use
<strong>Sly Takeoff</strong> to move away when fighting.</p>

<h3 id="aarakocra-windcaller">Aarakocra Windcaller</h3>

<p>Priests and mystics trained in the aarakocra primal tradition, they know the
secret spells to command the wind and use it to fight. They’re Level 8
Controllers with the Leader tag and 82 HP.</p>

<p>Windcallers really lean into the whole “vulture-folk” thing for DS aarakocra,
since their powers seem to have a <em>stench</em> theme in addition to a wind
theme. For example, their <strong>Carrion Scent</strong> (aura 10) let flying allies inside
hover if they have a fly speed, and make them deal +4 damage to bloodied
enemies.</p>

<p>Their melee basic attack is a <strong>Wafting Claw</strong> that damages and slows (save
ends) in a hit. On the first failed save, the target falls prone. They also have
a ranged basic attack, <strong>Foul Gust</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex) that damages and
slides 3 squares on a hit.</p>

<p>In less stinky news, they can also envelop a target in a <strong>Dust Veil</strong> (ranged
10 vs. Reflex, recharge 4+) that damages and forces the target to treat any
nonadjacent creatures as having concealment (save ends). On the first failed
save, the target is blinded for a turn.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can also generate an <strong>Instant Whirlwind</strong> (close blast
5 vs. Fortitude), which damages enemies, slides them 4 squares, and knocks them
prone on a hit. As an effect, it also lets allies inside the blast shift 2
squares.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>Aarakocra rarely work with other sapients, except maybe for the occasional
cooperation with kenku. They will however follow or lure dangerous predators who
live in their territory towards groups of intruders they want to kill, and then
swoop down to deal with the survivors.</p>

<p>Additionally, their traditional ability to summon elementals is still here, now
as an off-screen ritual instead of something that has to happen mid-fight. So
it’s entirely possible for encounters to include elementals or other primal
spirits.</p>

<p>And as with any kind of sapient person in this hellish wasteland, they might be
found in the service of the many despots of Athas as enslaved scouts and
soldiers.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Mechanically I think these are mostly equivalent to traditional aarakocra in
terms of capabilities, but I like that their lore makes them a group PCs are
likely to deal with at some point, instead of putting them atop isolated
mountain ranges.</p>

<p>As I write this, RPGnet forum user zedturtle is just starting a Let’s Read of
the Dark Sun Campaign Setting for 4e, and I thought I’d join in on the fun by
doing a parallel Let’s Read of the Creature Catalog.</p>

<p>The Creature Catalog was published alongside the Campaign Setting in 2010, and
is the “second to last” monster book published for D&amp;D Fourth Edition. The last
one would be Threats to the Nentir Vale, which I already covered and which can
be read either <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">in my blog</a> or on the <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/lets-read-threats-to-the-nentir-vale.904788/">RPG.net forums</a>. It did still come
after the Monster Manual 3, and so enjoys the rules and formatting improvements
that came with that book.</p>

<p>The book opens up with a short description of the stat block format, and tells
us that the book is divided into two sections. “Monsters A to Z” is the kind of
thing you’ve come to expect from a monster book, and “Personages of Athas” is a
bunch of important NPCs and major villains like the Sorcerer Kings.</p>

<h2 id="fourth-edition-monster-rules-a-refesher">Fourth Edition Monster Rules: A Refesher</h2>

<p>I posted something similar at the start of every monster book Let’s Read, and
I’ll do so again this time, since it’s been a while.</p>

<h3 id="level-and-role">Level and Role</h3>

<p>Unlike 3e and 5e, Fourth Edition D&amp;D doesn’t have the concept of a “Challenge
Rating”. Monsters instead have levels ranging from 1 to 30, just like PCs. A
monster’s base attack bonus, damage, defenses, and HP are all based on its
level, with adjustments for its combat role.</p>

<p>A monster’s combat role determines the monster’s baseline stats and most of its
preferred tactics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Skirmishers are highly mobile melee combatants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Soldiers have good AC, accurate attacks, and usually some ability that helps
draw PC attention to themselves. They form a “front line” that protects Team
Monster’s squishier damage dealers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brutes deal heavy damage and have more HP, but are a bit less accurate and
easier to hit. They’re also good components of the front line, particularly
when paired with soldiers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Controllers are good at both melee and ranged combat, and have lots of area
attacks and other powers that impose negative conditions on PCs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Artillery monsters have strong and accurate ranged attacks, but are worse at
melee and kinda fragile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lurkers are fragile in a direct fight but have attacks that deal huge damage
if certain conditions are met. Most commonly, that’s when they attack from
hiding. They have abilities that let them re-establish that condition, so a
typical lurker will attack one turn and spend the next one hiding again.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to this “primary” role, there are some extra roles a monster might
have. An Elite monster is worth two regular monsters, with double the HP and
some ability to perform multiple attacks per turn. A Solo monster is worth five
regulars, has four times the HP, attacks that affect a large number of PCs at
the same time, and usually some resistance to being “stun-locked”. Minions are
weak monsters that deal half the damage for their level and always have 1 HP
(but cannot be damaged by missed attacks). Four to six minions are worth one
regular monster.</p>

<p>Finally, a monster tagged as a Leader will have abilities that enhance their
buddies somehow.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.blogofholding.com/?p=512">famous post</a> from the Blog of Holding has the individual monster design
formula written out as compactly as possible. This also shows us that it’s easy
to adjust a monster’s level on the fly, if needed.</p>

<h3 id="origin-and-type">Origin and Type</h3>

<p>Monsters also have an origin and a type, though that’s more of a lore component
and doesn’t affect mechanics like it does in 3e and 5e.</p>

<p>The origin tells us the place in 4e’s cosmology to which the monster is most
closely tied, even if it’s not currently where it lives. Each of the big planes
has its own origin tag. Natural monsters are from the natural world (known as
the “Prime Material” in other editions), Fey monsters from the Feywild, Aberrant
monsters are tied to the Far Realm, and so on.</p>

<p>Monster type is largely “vibes” based in a way I really like:</p>

<p>Beasts behave like animals; magical beasts look like animals and behave like
people; humanoids look and behave like people; animates are non-intelligent
things that move because of magic. A giant ant is a natural beast, an elf is a
fey humanoid, a shield guardian is a natural animate, a zombie is a shadow
animate.</p>

<p>Humanoid doesn’t even mean “two arms and two legs”: centaurs are fey humanoids!
I love this system. In previous readings, I tended to go with Int scores and the
like to guess if a monster was sapient or not, but in this one I’m going mostly
from the classification.</p>

<h3 id="encounter-design">Encounter Design</h3>

<p>When designing encounters, the GM decides the encounter’s level (which is
usually from 1 to 35). That and the number of PCs in the party gives them a XP
budget for the encounter. The easiest way to fill this budget is to add a number
of regular monsters equal to the number of PCs, of the same level as the
encounter. Obviously GMs can mix it up by varying monster levels, and adding
minions, elites or solos too.</p>

<p>Encounter level <em>doesn’t</em> have to be equal to the party’s level. An “equal
level” encounter is considered a easy-to-moderate difficulty fight. Level-1 or
Level-2 are easy, and anything lower than that is not worth playing out using
the full combat rules. Level+4 or Level+5 are scary nightmare battles where
victory is no longer assured, suitable for final boss fights. Anything harder
than that will dramatically increase the chances of a TPK.</p>

<p>Encounters don’t <em>have</em> to be “perfectly balanced”, not anymore than they do in
any other edition. What this system does is deliver <em>consistent</em> encounters. If
you want them to be easy, they’ll be easy. If you want them to be hard, they’ll
be hard. The number of times where the opposite of what you want happens is kept
to a minimum. And that’s why I love these rules to bits.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Este post é completamente diferente do conteúdo usual do Octopus Carnival, mas
obter a informação aqui foi tão complicado que eu me sinto compelido a deixar
instruções para as gerações futuras (e para mim mesmo, caso eu esqueça). Ele
está em português porque estas instruções são relevantes para quem está no
Brasil.</p>

<p>Neste artigo, eu vou explicar todos os passos necessários para emitir e instalar
um certificado digital A3 (e-CPF ou e-CNPJ) em uma máquina rodando Ubuntu 22.04
ou 24.04.</p>

<p>O post foi originalmente escrito no meio de 2024, mas até onde eu sei suas
instruções ainda são válidas.</p>

<h2 id="background-e-introdução">Background e Introdução</h2>

<p>Pode pular essa sessão inteira se você só quer as instruções. Vá direto aos
Pré-Requisitos.</p>

<p>Apenas uma raríssima minoria das certificadoras brasileiras sequer apresenta
instruções para emitir um utilizar um certificado A3 em Linux, e essas
instruções são invariavelmente para uma versão mais antiga do Ubuntu, como a
18.04 ou a 20.04. Se você tem uma versão mais recente, como provavelmente é o
caso, você está por conta própria. O propósito deste artigo é remediar isso. Ele
reúne informações de diversas fontes separadas.</p>

<p>Minha inspiração para escrever este post foi <a href="https://linuxuniverse.com.br/linux/token-a3">este outro excelente artigo</a>
que explica muitas das mesmas coisas. A diferença aqui é que ele usa uma versão
um pouco mais antiga de alguns softwares, com instalação mais complicada.</p>

<h2 id="pré-requisitos">Pré-requisitos</h2>

<p>Você precisa de um computador rodando a versão mais atualizada do Ubuntu 22.04
ou 24.04, ou um de seus derivados (como o Pop OS). Os passos a seguir em geral
são válidos para as duas versões, com uma única excessão:</p>

<p><strong>O Assinador SERPRO só pode ser instalado no Ubuntu 22.04 ou derivados!</strong> A
versão mais recente quando da autoria deste post é a 4.2.1, que depende da
biblioteca <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libappindicator1</code>, que por sua vez foi removida do Ubuntu 24.04.</p>

<h2 id="passo-1-adquira-o-token">Passo 1: Adquira o Token</h2>

<p>Escolher um dispositivo físico com bom suporte a Linux costumava ser uma dor de
cabeça sem tamanho, mas isso agora está bem mais fácil: usaremos um token USB do
modelo Safenet eToken 5110.</p>

<p>Se você conhecer uma certificadora que venda certificados A3 em tokens com esse
modelo, pode pular este passo, o passo 3, e o passo 6. Caso contrário,
precisamos de um token vazio para cada certificado que queremos obter. Cada
token guarda apenas um único certificado. A <a href="https://loja.digitalsecurity.com.br/">Digital Security do Brasil</a>
vende tokens vazios, e ela não é a única. Se tiver outra loja de sua confiança,
pode encomendar por lá.</p>

<h2 id="passo-2-instale-o-driver-do-token">Passo 2: Instale o Driver do Token</h2>

<p>Mesmo um token USB ainda precisa de um driver especializado para ser lido. O
eToken 5110 utiliza o Safenet Authentication Client, e foi por isso que eu o
escolhi - ele roda em ambas as versões do Ubuntu visadas por este artigo e tem
uma interface um pouco mais agradável e completa.</p>

<p>Precisamos da versão 10.8 do cliente. A maioria dos lugares só tem até a 10.7
para download, mas a GlobalSign tem a 10.8 <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/en/safenet-drivers/USB/10.8/GlobalSign-SAC-Ubuntu-2204.zip">aqui</a>.</p>

<p>Faça o download (é gratuito e não requer registro), extraia o arquivo zip, e
ache o arquivo chamado <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">safenetauthenticationclient_10.8.1050_amd64.deb</code> dentro
da estrutura. Instale-o em seu sistema usando os seguintes comandos:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>dpkg <span class="nt">-i</span> safenetauthenticationclient_10.8.1050_amd64.deb
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">--fix-broken</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>O primeiro comando acima instala o pacote; o segundo instala quaisquer
dependências dele que estejam faltando. Todas essas dependências existem nos
repositórios padrão do Ubuntu 22.04 e 24.04.</p>

<h2 id="passo-3-inicialize-o-token">Passo 3: Inicialize o Token</h2>

<p>Cada token deve ter duas senhas associadas a ele. Uma senha “de usuário” (PIN)
que é usada para acessar o conteúdo do token, e uma senha de administração (PUK)
que é usada para modificar as informações dele. Neste passo vamos definir as
duas para o(s) token(s) que você adquiriu no primeiro passo.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.locasuporte.com.br/suporte_manuais/safenet/manual_etoken5110.pdf">Este manual</a> explica como inicializar um eToken 5110 vazio usando o Safenet
Authentication Client que instalamos no passo anterior. As instruções relevantes
começam na página 11. Lembre-se de anotar as senhas em um local seguro, como um
gerenciador de senhas. Elas não podem ser recuperadas de outra maneira depois de
definidas.</p>

<p>O processo basicamente consiste em mudar as senhas de um valor pré-defindo “de
fábrica” para os valores que você deseja. Se você adquiriu o seu token de outra
loja que não a Digital Security, pode ser que a senha default seja outra -
cheque o manual que vier com ele. <strong>Jamais mantenha a senha de fábrica do
token!</strong></p>

<h2 id="passo-4-compre-seu-certificado-a3">Passo 4: Compre Seu Certificado A3</h2>

<p>Aqui eu tive uma boa experiência com a <a href="https://www.soluti.com.br/">Soluti</a> e o <a href="https://www.mafragrupo.com.br/">Grupo Mafra</a>. Em
ambos os casos foi necessário falar com o canal de vendas por WhatsApp deles
para especificar que eu precisava de um certificado digital A3 sem mídia. A
Soluti vende e-CPF e e-CNPJ - eles têm loja virtual mas para adquirir sem mídia
ainda é necessário falar com um representante. O Grupo Mafra vende direto por
WhatsApp e representa a certificadora ABS, que no final das contas também emite
certificado pela Soluti - mas o preço deles é bem menor.</p>

<p>Em ambos os casos o procedimento foi o mesmo. Após pagar o certificado, marquei
uma videoconferência pelo sistema deles, na qual foi verificada minha identidade
e obti uma <em>senha de emissão e revogação</em>. No caso da Mafra/ABS, fui direcionado
a uma página onde eu mesmo gerei a senha. No caso da Soluti, eles me passaram a
senha durante a chamada de vídeo.</p>

<p>Após o sucesso da chamada, recebi um e-mail com um assunto parecido com
“Solicitação de Certificado Digital aprovada”. No corpo desse e-mail, há um
número de solicitação e um “Usuário de Emissão”. Esse é o nome de usuário que
faz par com a senha obtida na chamada. Precisamos dos dois para os próximos
passos.</p>

<h2 id="passo-5-instale-o-java-8">Passo 5: Instale o Java 8</h2>

<p>Sim, é o Java. Sim, é o oito. Vamos precisar dele para rodar o programa que
realiza a emissão dos certificados. Felizmente, não precisa ser o java da
Oracle. Use o seguinte comando:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>openjdk-8-jdk icedtea-netx
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Isso instala a mais recente versão do OpenJDK 8, que tem paridade com o da
Oracle para os nossos propósitos. O <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">icedtea-netx</code> nos dá a funcionalidade do
Java Web Start porque sim, também precisamos disso.</p>

<p>Após instalar o JDK, configure seu sistema para que ele seja o
padrão. Precisamos fazer isto de duas maneiras diferentes. A primeira é:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>update-alternatives <span class="nt">--config</span> java
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Isso vai mostrar um menu com os diferentes executáveis Java no seu
sistema. Mesmo que você não tenha instalado nenhum antes do 8, pode ser que o
sistema tenha instalado o 11 junto. Pressione o número correspondente ao <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java</code>
to JDK 8 e depois <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;enter&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Depois, use esta sequência de comandos para fazer o Java Web Start entender que
queremos executá-lo com Java 8:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> /usr/lib/jvm/
<span class="nb">sudo rm </span>default-java
<span class="nb">sudo ln</span> <span class="nt">-s</span> java-8-openjdk-amd64 default-java
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="passo-6-prepare-para-a-emissão">Passo 6: Prepare para a Emissão</h2>

<p>Com o Safenet Authentication Client rodando, plugue o seu token vazio no
computador. Tenha à mão a senha PIN gerada no passo 3, e também o usuário e
senha obtidos no passo 4.</p>

<p>A Soluti possui um manual de emissão bem completo <a href="https://www.soluti.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Instalacao-A3.pdf">aqui</a>. Note que já fizemos
muito do que está lá: temos o driver certo do nosso token, e a versão correta do
Java.</p>

<p>Seguindo o manual, o próximo passo é baixar o aplicativo emissor <a href="https://emissor.ca.inf.br/prod/Emissor.jnlp">aqui</a>. Você
vai notar que isso é um arquivo de extensão <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jnlp</code>. É por isso que precisamos do
Java Web Start.</p>

<p>Em um terminal, vá ao diretório onde você baixou o arquivo <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Emissor.jnlp</code> e
execute o seguinte commando:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>javaws Emissor.jnlp
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Você pode a partir daqui seguir o <a href="https://www.soluti.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Instalacao-A3.pdf">manual da Soluti</a>. Como já disse, vai
precisar do nome de usuário e senha do Passo 4 para iniciar a emissão, e a senha
do passo 3 para abrir seu token para a gravação das chaves e certificados.</p>

<p>Ao final deste passo, você já tem seu certificado digital emitido! Os próximos
passos deixam seu sistema pronto para <em>usar</em> o certificado.</p>

<h2 id="passo-7-certifique-se-de-que-o-firefox-é-um-pacote-deb">Passo 7: Certifique-se de que o Firefox é um pacote .deb</h2>

<p>Conforme é dito no <a href="https://linuxuniverse.com.br/linux/token-a3">post que me inspirou a inscrever este artigo</a>, a versão
Snap do Firefox, que vem com o Ubuntu, não reconhece o token, porque não tem
acesso às portas USB. Precisamos instalar o browser como um pacote .deb
tradicional.</p>

<p>É possível que você já tenha feito isso por algum outro motivo, ou esteja usando
uma variante que já faz isso como o Pop_OS. Se esse for o caso, pode pular este
passo.</p>

<p>Caso contrário, adicione o PPA da equipe Mozilla às suas fontes de software:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Em seguida, crie um arquivo chamado <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/preferences.d/mozilla-firefox</code> com os
seguintes conteúdos:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Package: firefox<span class="k">*</span>
Pin: release <span class="nv">o</span><span class="o">=</span>LP-PPA-mozillateam
Pin-Priority: 1001

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Isso guarante que a versão do PPA tenha precedência sobre o Snap. A seguir,
remova o Snap e instale a versão do PPA:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>snap remove firefox

<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt remove firefox

<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-t</span> <span class="s1">'o=LP-PPA-mozillateam'</span> firefox
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="passo-8-adicione-suporte-ao-token-ao-firefox">Passo 8: Adicione Suporte ao Token ao Firefox</h2>

<p>Vá em “Edit” -&gt; “Settings” e procure por “Security Devices”. Clique o botão que
aparece nos resultados.</p>

<p>Na janela que vai aparecer, clique em “NSS Internal PKCS #11 Module”, depois em
“Load” no canto direito da tela. No diálogo que aparecer, dê o nome que quiser
ao módulo e em “Module filename” entre <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/lib/libeToken.so</code>.</p>

<p>O módulo vai carregar e aparecer na lista do canto esquerdo desta mesma
janela. A partir daí você pode plugar seu token, escolher “Log In”, e entrar com
a senha PIN dele para ter acesso ao certificado.</p>

<p>Com isso, você já pode usar seu certificado para realizar login em serviços que
o exijam. Ele também permite que procurações sejam assinadas pelo serviço e-CAC
do Ministério da Fazenda.</p>

<h2 id="passo-9-assinador-serpro">Passo 9: Assinador SERPRO</h2>

<p>Conforme dito na introdução, <strong>o Assinador SERPRO só pode ser instalado em
Ubuntu 22.04 ou derivados</strong>.</p>

<p>Se o seu sistema se encaixa nessa categoria, basta seguir o <a href="https://tutorial.assinadorserpro.estaleiro.serpro.gov.br/html/demo_4.html">tutorial</a> da
própria SERPRO. Isso vai instalar a versão 4.2.1 do assinador, que é a mais
recente quando da autoria deste post. O Assinador SERPRO é usado para assinar
documentos em PDF ou XML em sua máquina local.</p>
