<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Silk Wyrms are snakelike monsters covered in chitinous carapaces. They’re gifted
with many natural weapons: bites laced with paralytic venom and the psionic
powers of flight, camouflage, and mesmerism.</p>

<p>Though incapable of communicating in humanoid languages they’re tenacious
endurance predators who employ clever hunting strategies.</p>

<p>Silk Wyrms will shadow their intended prey for days, looking for a time when its
guard is down. The book is not too specific about the nature of this prey. It
could be an adventuring party, a traveling caravan with humanoids and several
kinds of pack animal, or something like a pack of baazrags or other wild
animals. What matters is that the prey is easy to hunt and can be eaten “fresh”,
because silk wyrms apparently only eat their victims while they’re alive, and
abandon them when they die.</p>

<p>When their intended targets are vulnerable, the silk wyrm will sneak in,
paralyze a chosen victim, and devour them on the spot. If it manages to
incapacitate more than one victim it will drag one of them to its nest, where it
will trap them in silk strands and eat them over the course of the next few days
while they’re still alive.</p>

<p>Silk wyrms band together as hatchlings, but as soon as they reach the adult
stage their deeply antisocial instincts take over and they set off on their own
to become lone hunters. Only after many years do they become wise enough to
overcome this instinct and start allying with other creatures. Some manage to
lead bands of their own younger kin, while others can ally with those creatures
whose telepathy allows them to communicate with the wyrms and buy their service
with easy food.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Silk Wyrms are Natural Magical Beasts with the Reptile tag and Low-Light
Vision. All silk wyrms have a flight speed, but their flight is Clumsy, which
means they have a -4 penalty to attacks and defenses while on the air. This
means silk wyrms only fly to travel, but they prefer to fight on the ground.</p>

<p>We’ll look at their other traits in each stat block below.</p>

<h3 id="silk-wyrm-hatchling">Silk Wyrm Hatchling</h3>

<p>Too frail to set out on their own, hatchlings roam the wastes in bands,
spreading out to scout for prey and emitting a loud chirping noise when they
find it to call their clutch-mates. They’re Medium-sized Level 3 Minion
Skirmishers, with ground and flight speeds of 6.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Blood Scent</strong> trait means their attacks against bloodied creatures
ignore concealment. These will mostly be <strong>bites</strong> that deal poison damage and
slow for a turn. When the hatchling hits 0 HP, they release <strong>Silk Strands</strong> as
a last attack, which deal a bit of acid damage and restrain (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="silk-wyrm-adult">Silk Wyrm Adult</h3>

<p>In their “lone hunter” phase, adults are Large-sized Level 3 Solo Skirmishers
with 174 HP. Their flight speed increases to 8, but remains clumsy.</p>

<p>Adults retain <strong>Blood Scent</strong>, which works exactly the same way. They will
likely start the encounter in <strong>Shadow Form</strong> (minor, recharges when first
bloodied), which makes Insubstantial with Phasing and gives them +5 to Stealth
while stopping it from attacking. It can get out of this with a free action, and
will do so shortly after springing its ambush.</p>

<p>Once the wyrm appears in the middle of its targets, and again whenever the power
is charged, it will use <strong>Mesmerizing Dread</strong> (minor, recharge 4+), which deals
psychic damage to enemies in a Close Burst 5, slides them 3 squares, and
inflicts a -2 penalty to all defenses for a turn. Then it’s bite time.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bites</strong> deal more poison damage, since they’re not minions, and their
venom becomes stronger. The target is slowed (save ends), which worsens to
immobilized (save ends) on the first save and to helpless (save ends) on the
second failure. <strong>Wyrm Strike</strong> lets it bite two different targets with one
action.</p>

<p>Helpless is a funny and very worrying condition. It’s funny because going
strictly by the book, you can move and act normally while Helpless. However
you’re never <em>just</em> Helpless. The most common way to get this condition is to be
unconscious. In this case, even on a strict reading you’ll still be Restrained
when you fail your second save and become Helpless.</p>

<p>Being Helpless is worrying because it makes the victim grant combat advantage,
and opens them up to the Coup de Grace action, which is an attack with any
applicable power that auto-crits and kills the target outright if it deals more
than their bloodied value in damage.</p>

<p>If the Silk Wyrm manages to get someone immobilized, restrained, or helpless, it
will <strong>Feed</strong> on them, attacking their Fortitide eating one of their healing
surges, and healing 10 HP. There’s no damage other than this, apparently, which
makes this attack a lot more forgiving in a fight than it would otherwise seem.</p>

<p>It someone hits the adult wyrm with a melee or close attack, it can respond with
<strong>Silk Strands</strong> as a reaction. This is a melee 3 attack vs. Reflex, dealing
acid damage and restraining on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="silk-worm-elder">Silk Worm Elder</h3>

<p>Elders have lived long enough to learn the value of teamwork despite or perhaps
<em>because</em> of the loss of their ability to project silk strands in combat. They
band together with one another or with other powerful allies in order to survive
and keep eating. They’re Level 14 Skirmishers with 125 HP. Not being solos, they
don’t have a blanked +5 on all saves, but they still have that bonus on saves
against Immobilized or Slowed.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Form</strong> and <strong>Mesmerizing Dread</strong> work exactly the same, with Shadow
Form just making the wyrm Weakened instead of preventing attacks entirely. They
can only <strong>bite</strong> once per turn but their venom remains as potent as the
adult’s.</p>

<p>The problem here is the damage: both Mesmerizing Dread and the basic bite do
exactly the same damage as the adult’s, which is way, way below what it should
be for a level 14 monster.</p>

<p><strong>Feed</strong>, on the other hand, does a huge chunk of physical damage (5d10+6) in
addition to deleting a healing surge. It recharges when first bloodied instead
of being at-will, but it no longer has any target restictions. They still really
want to use this in a helpless target if they can, because it’s going to kill
any helpless target with 112 maximum HP or less.</p>

<p>Still, outside of their one or two uses of Feed, elders are significantly less
scary. The venom is still a concern, particularly if they have heavy hitters
with them, but barring errata it seems to me elders were made to rush in, use
Feed once or twice, and escape the fight using Shadow Form and <strong>Serpent
Strike</strong>, which they still have.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think the Lore section outlines possible silk wyrm encounters pretty well.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the first two seem okay to me, but the elder is weird. The damage
of their bites and Mesmerizing stare needs a buff. It’d make them more
consistently dangerous despite making their Feed attack a little less impressive
in comparison (as its 28 average damage is not a lot higher than the 22 their
bites would need).</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>This wouldn’t be a proper D&amp;D monster book without at least one vile seductress
that tries to lure in unsuspecting adventurers with her womanly wiles.</p>

<p>Sand Brides are basically Darker and Sunnier Nymphs. More specifically, they are
the things this world’s surviving nymphs turned into when the ecosystem went to
shit and the Feywild was mostly destroyed. Like a lot of other Athasian fey,
they blame all intelligent natural creatures for their corrupted state, and try
to victimize them as an act of vengeance.</p>

<p>Their preferred tactic is to build traps and ambush spots out in the desert and
use their illusion powers to disguise them as safe places like oases, sheltering
ruins, or caravan rest stops. Then they disguise themselves as harmless
humanoids and try to lure their targets to the ambush. The illustration and some
of the descriptions imply these “harmless humanoids” are pretty ladies, but they
don’t have to be.</p>

<p>Once the victims are at the intended spot, the ambush is sprung, and the sand
bride will use her sand-bending powers and dehydrating touch to kill the
victims, leaving only dried husks behind.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Sand Brides are Medium Fey Humanoids and Level 10 Elite Controllers with an even
200 HP. Despite being living beings they have Darkvision and are immune to
disease and poison, traits commonly found in undead. Their ground speed is 8,
and they have a burrow speed of 6. This <em>doesn’t</em> say it’s for loose earth only,
so they could theoretically tunnel through rock.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Sandform Body</strong> lets them ignore all difficult terrain, tough they’re
less diffuse than the dune constructs we saw previously. They attack in melee
with a <strong>Dehydrating Touch</strong> that deals necrotic damage and inflicts -2 to all
defenses for a turn on a hit. At range, they use <strong>Sand Blasts</strong> that deal
physical damage and push 4 squares. <strong>Double Attack</strong> lets them make two melee
attacks per action.</p>

<p>They can also employ a <strong>Sand Drown</strong> power (recharge 5+) if the PCs bunch up
too much. This is an Area 1 Within 10 attack, dealing heavy physical damage and
restraining on a hit.</p>

<p>Its ability to create illusory terrain is weaponized as an <strong>Insidious Mirage</strong>
(Encounter), which lets the Sand Bride create a zone 4 squares on a side that
lasts until the end of the encounter. This counts as difficult terrain for
enemies, lets the bride slide enemies who end their turns inside by up to 2
squares as a free action, and can be moved by up to 4 squares as minor action.</p>

<p>And finally they have <strong>Deceptive Veil</strong>, allowing them to appear as a humanoid
of any species. Piercing the illusion requires an Insight contest against the
bride’s Bluff skill of +15. This doesn’t <em>have</em> to be a pretty lady, but it’s
apparently traditional. The bride’s stats remain the same while disguised, and
she can attack without dropping the illusion.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Sand brides target groups of travelers The creatures are fairly social with each
other and will organize in groups. They can probably ally with other fey too, or
have some Athasian beasts under their control ready to attack.</p>

<p>I’m not overly fond of vile seductress monsters but sand brides seem easy to
reskin into something less cliche while keeping the same tactics.</p>

    A rampager, which look like a big green kaiju with a human-like face.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These creatures were known as so-ut in olden times, but most people found that
name wasn’t very descriptive, so now they’re known as Rampagers. And they do
what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>True, that doesn’t narrow it down by a lot given that we just looked at
Nightmare Beasts, which are also big rampaging monsters. But there are some
important differences: Nightmare Beasts are hateful monsters twisted by the
energies of the Gray who hate all living things; Rampagers are hateful monsters
twisted by vengeful primal spirits who hate all artifice.</p>

<p>Sure, they’ll kill anything that gets in their way, but the thing they really
hate are buildings and other constructed signs of civilization. The cloud of
angry elementals that constantly surrounds these creatures fills them with rage
and drives them to seek these things out and utterly destroy them with their
acidic claws. Ruins or new buildings, it doesn’t matter. They will all be razed
to their foundations.</p>

<p>Those who can’t take on a Rampager in direct combat (i.e, most Athasians) might
have a chance to avoid a deadly confrontation by placating the immaterial
spirits that surround the creature via rituals or diplomacy, convincing them to
direct their weapon elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>A Rampager is a Large Elemental Beast and a Level 21 Solo Brute with 800 HP. It
has Darkvision and a ground speed of 7.</p>

<p>The angry spirits surrounding the so-ut aren’t modeled as separate creatures and
cannot be targeted in combat, but I think they might be the source of its
<strong>Entropic Presence</strong> aura (2), which <em>strips immunities and resistances</em> from
all creatures and objects within. I believe that does include most of the
inherent immunities objects have (such as to poison and necrotic damage).</p>

<p>The Rampager also has two other passive traits: <strong>Destruction’s Storm</strong> boosts
its damage while bloodied, and <strong>Soul of Destruction</strong> boosts it even more
against constructs, objects, and structures.</p>

<p>Its active attacks start with acid-laced Reach 2 <strong>Claws</strong>, which deal a hearty
blend of physical and acid damage and penalize AC by -1 until the end of the
encounter on a hit. This accumulates to a maximum of -5. And to top it off they
have the High Crit property.</p>

<p>The <strong>Bite</strong> is Reach 2 and targets Reflex, and seems weak at first, but that’s
just the primary attack. If that hits, the creature makes a secondary attack
against the target’s Fortitude, which weakens and inflicts 30 ongoing poison
damage on a hit (save ends). Entropic Presence makes this as effective against
structures and objects as it would be against flesh and blood enemies.</p>

<p>Our last attack is the one that gives the Rampager its name: <strong>Destructive
Rampage</strong> is an at-will power that lets it make three claw and one bite attack
in any order. At most 2 attacks can be directed at the same target, and the
monster can shift 2 squares after each one as an effect.</p>

<p>When the Rampager is first bloodied, and again when it drops to 0 HP, it can use
Destructive Rampage as a free action.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Overall I wasn’t as impressed by the Rampager’s lore since it comes right after
the Nightmare Beast and the Psurlon, but it’s very in theme for Athas. You could
also easily reskin it as a sort of tarrasque spawn, since both follow similar
themes.</p>

<p>Mechanically, I think all the mechanics that combine to make it a menace against
constructs and structures are really cool. I can easily see an adventure where
PCs must somehow direct a rampager to fight something like the Dark Sun version
of the Wandering Tower (originally from Threats to the Nentir Vale). And of
course, if this thing ever meets a Nightmare Beast meet, they’re going to fight,
and while the Rampager as written might not win that one without PC help it can
serve as an important distraction.</p>

<p>The book clearly intends for Rampagers to be found alone, since as mentioned
above the spirit cloud is more of an special effect than a separate creature,
mechanically. Nothing stops you from adding some actual epic level elementals to
the encounter if your PCs are higher level, though.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A long time ago, in a world far, far away, there was a civilization whose
mastery of psionics was so complete they decided to merge their entire
population into a single collective god-mind. They failed, and the backlash
destroyed their planet.</p>

<p>The survivors managed to escape to the Astral Sea, but only as disembodied
consciences. There, they came upon another world that radiated vast amounts of
psychic energy, comparable to their old home. The survivors were drawn to it
like moths to a flame, piercing the barriers that surrounded this new world and
taking over a species of worm that turned out to be particularly receptive to
their minds.</p>

<p>Over the following generations, these planar refugees would shape their hosts to
be more useful to their mysterious purposes, and would come to prefer their new
bodies over their old humanoid forms. And this is how the psurlons came to be,
though no one in Athas really knows the whole story.</p>

<p>Some psurlons reside in the Gray, amid the graves of the gods. Many others live
in Athas itself, where they often take human form to infiltrate and spy on the
city-states of the sorcerer-kings, working towards some mysterious goal of their
own. Psurlons are an old people with long memories and extremely advanced
psionic skills, so sometimes they’ll be sought out by powerful psychics,
spellcasters, and historians willing to risk their lives to bargain for
knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Psurlons are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts. They have resistance to psychic
damage, a burrow speed, and Tremorsense, though the exact values on these traits
vary per stat block. Their signature ability is <strong>Armored Mind</strong>, a passive
trait that lets them roll saves against domination both at the start and end of
their turns, even if the condition doesn’t normally end with a save.</p>

<h3 id="psurlon-dustworm">Psurlon Dustworm</h3>

<p>Dustworms are specialized infiltrators, disguising themselves as humanoids to
spy on the city-states and on the comings and goings of the
sorcerer-kings. They’re Level 17 Skirmishers with 164 HP. Their ground and
burrow speeds are 8, and they have 5 psychic resistance and Tremorsense 10.</p>

<p>The dustworm can <strong>Change Shape</strong> as a minor action to appear as a
humanoid. Others need to pass a DC 36 Insight check to detect the
deception. Most dustworms encountered by PCs will start out disguised, and will
do their best to maintain cover until there is no other alternative. Then, they
take their natural shapes and fight, likely attempting to escape.</p>

<p>In addition to Armored Mind, they also project a <strong>Psychic Deadpool</strong> (aura 5),
which inflicts -2 on enemy saves against ongoing psychic damage. They can attack
in melee with their <strong>Claws</strong>, which damage and deal ongoing 5 psychic damage
(save ends). At range, they fling <strong>Mindknives</strong> which deal psychic damage and
forbid the target from making opportunity attacks for a turn.</p>

<p>Both of these attacks can be boosted by <strong>Psionic Augment</strong>, which triggers
after one of them hits and lets them deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage. This
recharges when the dustworm takes psychic damage.</p>

<p>They can use a <strong>Burrowing Attack</strong> to burrow half their speed, attack someone
with a claw, and then burrow the other half of their speed. This is strangely
precise phrasing compared to the other “moving attack” skills we have seen so
far.</p>

<h3 id="psurlon-warworm">Psurlon Warworm</h3>

<p>Warworms cannot change shape, possibly because they’re Huge instead of
Medium. They defend psurlon settlements and stay hidden underground near
infiltrators, waiting to burst out when things go pear-shaped. They’re Level 18
Elite Brutes with 424 HP. Their ground and burrow speeds are 6, their
Tremorsense is 20, and their psychic resistance is 15.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> deals heavy damage and inflicts ongoing 5 psychic damage (save
ends), and <strong>Double Attack</strong> lets them bite twice per action. Once per
encounter, they can let out a <strong>Mind Scream</strong> that attacks enemies in a Close
Burst 2. A hit deals heavy psychic damage and stuns for a turn. Nasty! A miss
deals half damage.</p>

<h3 id="psurlon-mindworm">Psurlon Mindworm</h3>

<p>Mindworms are powerful seers, able to see many futures at once. They guide their
fellow psurlons to the ones most favorable to their secret objectives. Mindworms
are Level 19 Controllers with 181 HP. Their movement speed is 6, they have 10
Psychic resistance, and Tremorsense 10.</p>

<p>Their additional passive is a <strong>Whispering Meme</strong> aura (5) that lets the
mindworm slide enemies that start their turns within 1 square. I guess the
mysterious whispers of “this is fine” and “always has been” drive enemies to
distraction.</p>

<p>A mindworm will probably start the fight at range and attempt to use <strong>Ego
Control</strong> (recharge 5+) on a PC. This deals a sizable chunk of psychic damage
and dominates on a hit (save ends). Then they’ll close in to melee range and
alternate between <strong>Referred Pain</strong> and their <strong>Psychic Claws</strong>. The first power
is a Close Burst 2 that deals psychic damage and slows for a turn; the other is
a basic attack that deals a mix of psychic and physical damage and inflicts -2
to AC for a turn.</p>

<p>Mindworms can also <strong>Change Shape</strong> and use <strong>Psionic Augment</strong>, both of which
work just like the dustworm’s, but with higher numbers.</p>

<p>There’s a lot here that reminds me of mind flayers, but I think I actually like
psurlons better. With mind flayers, you know they want to eat your brain, and
most PCs will start drawing their weapons as soon as they spot one.</p>

<p>Psurlons have a much more mysterious goal, so they can more easily fill the
“mysterious but dangerous stranger” role instead of always being overtly
hostile. Heck, PCs might want to ally with them against a sorcerer-king.</p>

<p>That said, they do employ a lot of the same tactics as flayers, including
keeping large groups of dominated thralls around to help compose mixed encounter
groups.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Nightmare Beasts are among the most feared horrors to walk the surface of Athas,
second only to the Dragon of Tyr itself. The mere presence of a nightmare beast
poisons the surrounding land and contaminates its water. This seems to be a
continuous defiling effect - and the beasts can defile further to fuel their
powers. The description also makes me think they might be <em>radioactive</em>, if you
want to inject some science fantasy into your campaign.</p>

<p>Sages can only speculate as to their origin. The leading theory is that they
were summoned from the Gray by powerful defilers during an age in the distant
past where war raged all over the world. Fully grown beasts are solitary, but
smaller versions can be seen hanging out in packs with each other or with other
predatory animals. Those same sages theorize these are young beasts, born
through natural reproduction.</p>

<p>Everything about the preceding paragraph is wrong, however. Nightmare beasts
form when one of the many natural predators of Athas consumes too much prey from
areas tainted by the Gray or marked by heavy defiling. The creature begins to
slowly mutate. It acquires intelligence, power, and a hatred for all living
things, becoming a nightmare beast when the metamorphosis is complete. The
“spawn” are merely beasts whose transformation is still ongoing. Fully
transformed beasts are solitary. Partially-mutated spawn still display behaviors
reminiscent of their previous form, which is why they can be found in packs.</p>

<p>Nightmare beast lairs tend to be pretty obvious and imposing landmarks at the
center of a horribly corrupted region.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Nightmare Beasts are Shadow Magical Beasts with Darkvision. We get stat blocks
for both spawn and fully transformed specimens. Both can invade people’s dreams
and use magical black lightning as a weapon, in addition to having very large
and sharp tusks, but the effects of all of these vary per stat block. We’ll see
them from weaker to stronger.</p>

<p>At the GM’s option, beasts poison the area around them when they die. The area
within 10 squares of a full beast’s corpse become Defiled Terrain (a hazard
described at the end of the book). Spawn also do this, but the area is only 5
squares in radius.</p>

<h3 id="nightmare-beast-spawn">Nightmare Beast Spawn</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, “spawn” is a misleading name. This Large creature was
formerly a more mundane Athasian predator who is currently in the process of
mutating into a nightmare beast. It will kinda resemble the animal it once was,
but is already clearly unnatural. Spawn are Level 16 Elite Artillery with 244
HP. Their ground speed is 8 and they also have Burrow and Climb speeds
of 4. Maybe this was a megapede?</p>

<p>The creature’s basic melee attack uses its <strong>Tusks</strong> (Melee 2), which damage and
slide the target 2 squares on a hit. Its favorite tactic, however, is to hang
back and rain <strong>Black Lightning</strong> (Ranged 20) upon its foes. This attack
vs. Reflex targets one or two victims. On a hit it deals “lightning and
necrotic” damage, and ongoing 5 necrotic damage (save ends). This worsens to 10
ongoing on the first failed save, and to <em>unconsciousness</em> (save ends) on the
second.</p>

<p>The spawn can further torment its unconscious victims with <strong>Horrid Nightmares</strong>
(minor action, recharge 6+, Ranged 10), which deal psychic damage and prevent
the target from rolling saves for a turn on a hit. Yeah the spawn can
potentially lock a PC down once they’re unconscious from Black Lightning. This
also works if they manage to sneak up on their victims while they sleep, though
the spawn might not yet be clever enough to think of this.</p>

<p>If a target steps into the spawn’s melee reach, it can use its <strong>Barbed Tongue</strong>
(Melee 3) as a reaction. This attack vs Fortitude deals necrotic damage on a hit
and prevents the target from regaining HP for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="nightmare-beast">Nightmare Beast</h3>

<p>The fully mutated beast is size Huge, and a Level 25 Solo Controller with 928
HP. In other words, it’s a kaiju. This specimen is stronger than the spawn in
every way, from physical weapons all the way to psychic and magical powers. Its
ground speed is just 6, though, with no other movement modes. It likes to use
its magic to torment its victims, but once it gets injured it will drop the mind
games and get physical.</p>

<p>The beast has no less than <em>three</em> basic attacks, all Melee 3 and each with a
different rider: <strong>Claws</strong> that slide 3 squares, <strong>Tusks</strong> that knock prone, and
a <strong>Bite</strong> that grabs the target if the beast hasn’t grabbed anyone yet. Each of
those of course also does respectable damage. <strong>Double Attack</strong> lets the beast
pick any two of those to use on the same action.</p>

<p><strong>Bloodied Fury</strong> (recharge 4+) becomes available while the beast is
bloodied. It lets the creature move its speed and use a claw/claw/tusk/bite
combo at any point along the movement, using up to two attacks against each
target.</p>

<p>While the beast is <em>not</em> bloodied, it can instead use its <strong>Black Lightning</strong>
(recharge 4+). This version targets 1 or 2 creatures in a Close Burst 5, and on
a hit inflicts ongoing <em>30</em> lightning and necrotic damage (save ends). Each
creature adjacent to one of the targets takes 20 lightning and necrotic damage
when the target is hit, as well. The targets fall unconscious right on the first
failed saving throw.</p>

<p>If the beast misses a target while using Black Lightning, it can use its
<strong>Hideous Defiling</strong> to attack every enemy in a Close Burst 2, dealing a chunk
of necrotic damage on a hit. A hit also allows it to reroll the missed Black
Lightning attacks.</p>

<p>Whether bloodied or not, the beast can inflict <strong>Horrid Nightmares</strong> on
unsconscious targets just like its less-developed counterpart, with better
damage. It can also use <strong>Dream Step</strong> at will, teleporting 15 squares to a
space adjacent to an unconscious creature!</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Full beasts will usually be found alone, as they kill anything else they can
perceive. A GM who wishes to add more spice to this solo encounter could add
powerful undead minions. The beast might tolerate their presence since they
aren’t living creatures.</p>

<p>Spawn could be found in groups, either with each other or still hanging around
their packs as the transformation proceeds. Eventually the day comes when they
complete the transformation and slay their packmates.</p>
