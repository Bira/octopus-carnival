        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As I mentioned in a <a href="/octopus-carnival/2025/12/22/lphr-background-change.html">post back in December</a>, I’ve been actually playing this
solo game in a sporadic fashion for years. And as I said back when I started, I
planned to post it here. So why didn’t I?</p>

<p>Basically, it was anxiety over art.</p>

<p>The first thing I was going to do was to post the stats for my player
characters, and since these were going to be “proper blog posts”, I decided I
wanted to have illustrations for them just like I have for all the other
characters I posted before.</p>

<p>My method of procuring them was going to be the same. I’d use search indexes and
trawl some specific art sites for published images I could add to the post, with
proper credit and a link to the original.</p>

<p>For certain characters, that’s dead easy. But for a couple of others I ended up
never finding an image that <em>exactly</em> matched what I wanted. Or when I did find
one that had the right vibe, it turned out the artist explicitly forbade this
kind of usage, even with proper credit. Also one of my sources was Pinterest and
I had just learned that one site had a serious “proper credit” issue. Whoops!
What to do?</p>

<p>I know exactly what suggestion is already forming in a lot of your brains right
now, and I’m gonna stop y’all right there and say “no”. I’m not using AI for
this, or anything else. Not now, not ever.</p>

<p>So after way too long you’ll get those posts without illustrations at all. I
can’t draw, but I can write, so you’re getting verbal descriptions. And maybe
then I can finally proceed with publishing this.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Even if the stuff we saw on our previous post was pretty hazardous, none of it
counts as a “hazard” in mechanical terms.</p>

<p>The main difference is that Terrain is entirely passive. It might do something
when you step on it, or it might allow a character to perform some special
action when next to it, but it never <em>initiates</em> any interaction.</p>

<p>Hazards, on the other hand, have enough “agency” to count as a monster for
encounter building purposes. They can make attacks, and can also be disabled by
the methods outlined in its description. Traps are the most popular example of
hazards, but these rules can also model dangerous terrain features that weren’t
built to do harm on purpose. Obviously, unlike real monsters, traps and hazards
don’t use tactics. They just follow their “programming”.</p>

<p>Traps and hazards have their own set of roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blasters</strong> make ranged or area attacks. A crossbow trap is the most popular
example.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lurkers</strong> can disappear for a while after making their attacks, so dealing
with them is harder. A blade trap that retracts into the wall is a good
example.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Obstacles</strong> impede movement, both by their presence and with attacks that
slow the target down. They might block passage entirely or require characters
to make tricky movement or puzzle-solving skill checks to pass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Warders</strong> are alarm systems. They can have damaging attacks too, and will
make them as soon as they detect intruders, but their main function is to warn
others about the presence of those intruders. The alarm might only sound once,
or keep sounding while the hazard persists. In truth, this seems to be kind of
a catch-all category. If the hazard can’t conceal itself after attacking and
doesn’t really impede movement, it’s a warder. A shrieker mushroom is a
non-damaging example.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the summarized descriptions below, I always start with a description of the
hazard’s nature and appearance, what it does when triggered, and how to avoid or
disable it.</p>

<h2 id="arena-hazards">Arena Hazards</h2>

<p>This subsection details hazards that might be found in the many gladiatorial
arenas of Athas. They’re placed on purpose to make things more “interesting”,
but they’re not really <em>traps</em> per se.</p>

<h3 id="worthy-sacrifices-of-draj">Worthy Sacrifices of Draj</h3>

<p>This is a 3-by-6 square pile or corpses with their hearts torn out. <em>Animated</em>
corpses, that will try to grab, pull, and gnaw on anyone they sense nearby. It’s
a Level 8 Obstacle.</p>

<p>PCs can notice the corpses are animated with Perception or Religion. The pile
makes opportunity attacks that damage and grab against any character who steps
adjacent to it. Roll Initiative for it after the first such attack. On its
turn, it will try to pull any grabbed victims into itself, dealing the same
damage as the initial attack and inflicting ongoing 10 necrotic damage while the
victims remain inside.</p>

<p>A PC can choose to make an Acrobatics test when they step adjacent to the pile
to avoid the opportunity attack. They can disable it either by good old
fashioned violence (70 HP, resist necrotic, vulnerable radiant), or by
improvising an exorcism with Nature and Religion. This is a complexiy 1 skill
challenge where each failure deals 5 necrotic damage to the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="blood-trees-of-gulg">Blood Trees of Gulg</h3>

<p>These are large trees with red leaves. The main arena in Gulg has about a dozen
of these planted in a semi-random arrangement. Their trunks completely fill a
square and count as blocking terrain. Their branches stretch 3 squares in every
direction from the trunk.</p>

<p>The rumor that these trees have red leaves because they feed on blood is
false. The leaves are naturally red, and the trees are mostly harmless. They
only turn carnivorous when they’re about to bloom, you see.</p>

<p>There’s no fixed blooming season - the timing for that is rather random. For
this specific arena, at most 3 trees might be dangerous at a time. The rest are
still blocking terrain, of course.</p>

<p>Blood Trees are level 9 Warders. Their presence is obvious, and a Nature or
Perception check can allow a PC to notice that a given tree is “primed” and what
its reach is (it’s 3).</p>

<p>When someone steps into that reach, the tree makes an opportunity attack that
damages and knocks prone on a hit. On its turn, it apparently uses another set
of branches to make attacks against Fortitude to damage, poison and fling away
anyone it hits with those. That’s ongoing 5 poison (save ends), plus a secondary
attack that makes a 5-square push on a hit.</p>

<p>Blood trees can be destroyed by violence (100 HP, resist 10 poison); and a PC
can succeed at a Nature check when stepping into their reach to avoid the
opportunity attack and be ignored by the tree for the rest of the encounter.</p>

<h3 id="obsidian-façades-of-urik">Obsidian Façades of Urik</h3>

<p>The arena in Urik is a former pit from an obsidian mine. Its walls are wickedly
sharp and good enough at absorbing heat that by noon the arena resembles a huge
natural air fryer. Guess when fights take place.</p>

<p>Characters inside the arena are exposed to Sun Sickness, a disease detailed in
the Dark Sun Campaign Setting that probably represents heat stroke and
dehydration. The walls are a variable level Obstacle, and moving adjacent to
them subjects the character to an attack that deals mixed physical and fire
damage that rises with tier. Characters doing so on purpose can attempt an
Acrobatics check to avoid this.</p>

<h2 id="next-up">Next up</h2>

<p>Wilderness hazards! Because the world itself is also out to get you.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>We’re done with monsters for now, and we’re getting into a section about
terrain.</p>

<p>Terrain is as important a building block for a fun encounters as the monsters
that make it up, and this section has some uniquely Dark and Sunny examples for
you to add to your battlemaps.</p>

<h2 id="barbed-cacti">Barbed Cacti</h2>

<p>Even when they don’t uproot themselves to hunt you down, Athasian cacti can
still be dangerous. These specimens have sharp spines that break off and stay
stuck to you. Lines of barbed cactus squares can be used to cordon off some
areas of the battlefield, and provide an excellent barrier for artillery
monsters to hide behind.</p>

<p>Entering a square of barbed cacti deals 3 damage and inflices -2 to attack rolls
(save ends).</p>

<h2 id="brambleweed">Brambleweed</h2>

<p>Like barbed cacti, but worse. Brambleweed grows in sprawling thickets that can
thrive even in defiled areas, because they can use the blood or corpses of
captured creatures as nourishment. Some defilers plant them intentionally as
defensive measures in their lairs.</p>

<p>A creature that ends their turn in a brambleweed square is restrained until the
end of their next turn. A creature that <em>starts</em> their turn there (which they
will if they were restrained) takes 5/tier damage.</p>

<h2 id="defiled-terrain">Defiled Terrain</h2>

<p>This is a more varied category describing several possibilities for what might
remain behind after a major act of defiling. It can be used as pre-existing
terrain in an area what was subject to defiling in the past, or you can place it
in the middle of the fight after someone uses Arcane Defiling or an equivalent
power.</p>

<h3 id="ash-field">Ash Field</h3>

<p>These are the remains of plant life caught in a defiling field. Sometimes the
wind causes them to pool in terrain depressions to form areas of Settled Ash,
which can act as a terrain feature.</p>

<p>Someone who’s adjacent to a square of settled ash can make an Athletics test to
raise a cloud of it, which functions as a blast attack vs. Fortitude that blinds
for a turn on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="black-sand">Black Sand</h3>

<p>The residue of defiling mixed in with the local soil. People standing on black
sand only regain half the normal amount of HP from healing effects. Wasn’t there
an entire geographical region covered in the stuff?</p>

<h3 id="dead-magic">Dead Magic</h3>

<p>Areas that have lost so much to defiling that they have nothing left to
give. Anyone standing on dead magic squares takes a -5 penalty to attack with
arcane or primal powers, and is barred from using Arcane Defiling.</p>

<p>The book recommends being careful with dead magic areas, particularly if there
are a lot of arcane and primal PCs in the party. Usually only very powerful
defilers are capable of creating them.</p>

<h3 id="sickening-heat">Sickening Heat</h3>

<p>This is either a mystical side effect of defiling, or it could just be a natural
consequence of killing all that plant cover. Creatures ending their turn on
these squares are weakened for a turn.</p>

<p>This terrain can do a number on your party’s strikers, and monsters who have the
ability to inflict forced movement simply love it.</p>

<h2 id="glimmering-mirage">Glimmering Mirage</h2>

<p>Mundane mirages are the effect of heat haze in the distance. These ones are more
than that: they’re illusions crafted by malicious primal spirits. In addition to
luring travelers, they persist once they get closer, and can conceal all kinds
of danger behinds their alluring façades.</p>

<p>Glimmering mirages form walls 4 or more squares long. They block line of sight,
and give concealment against ranged attacks to anyone standing adjacent to
them. At the end of every turn, you roll a d6 for each mirage. A 1 means it’s
gone, a 6 means it moves 5 squares, and other results mean it stays put.</p>

<h2 id="lightning-pillar">Lightning Pillar</h2>

<p>Literally a pillar of congealed lightning, probably created due to the area’s
proximity to an “electric” region of the Elemental Chaos. PCs and enemies might
be able to use their Arcana, Nature, or Religion skills to “hack” such a pillar
and make it deliver a lightning strike to a chosen target.</p>

<h2 id="mudflats">Mudflats</h2>

<p>These are natural areas where underground water surfaces a bit and mixes with
the soil, creating an area that is both dusty and sludgy at the same
time. Inland mudflats are the next best thing to oases, and draw many animals
and people who learn to extract water from them.</p>

<p>Particularly thick mud flats are difficult terrain, and can contain <strong>mud sink</strong>
squares representing deeper areas. Creatures standing adjacent to those can be
pushed into them, which will immobilize them (save ends), with a slow
after-effect due to the clinging mud (also save ends). Voluntarily or
accidentally stepping into one would have the same effect.</p>

<h2 id="psychic-reservoirs">Psychic Reservoirs</h2>

<p>Fragile purple crystals that grow in psychically charged areas sheltered from
the winds, these can be tapped by psionic characters to boost their attacks. It
takes a minor action to tap into an adjacent crystal, which makes it crumble to
dust. If the character uses power points, they gain 1 bonus point that lasts
until the end of the encounter. Otherwise they gain +5 to their next damage roll
from a psionic power.</p>

<h2 id="rocky-badlands">Rocky Badlands</h2>

<p>These regions are too rough to support permanent settlements, so they’ll mostly
feature as ambush sites. They’re filled with <strong>teetering stone pillars</strong> that
can be pushed onto enemies.</p>

<h2 id="salt-flats">Salt Flats</h2>

<p>These bone-dry regions are a hassle to fight in, as salt will inevitably get in
the wounds and make them sting like hell. They’re also filled with loose <strong>salt
piles</strong> that work a lot like the Settled Ash hazard above, except that they also
slow the target if it was bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="sandy-wastes">Sandy Wastes</h2>

<p>What most people think of when they hear “desert”. They can contain 3x3-square
<strong>Small Dunes</strong> that anyone might use as a hiding or ambush spot, even if they
can’t normally burrow.</p>

<h2 id="silt-pools">Silt Pools</h2>

<p>They work a lot like mud flats, except there’s no water, just very fine
dust. Usually filled with difficult terrain, and with <strong>deep silt spots</strong> that
restrain (save ends) anyone who falls or gets pushed into them.</p>

<h2 id="slipsand">Slipsand</h2>

<p>Sandy areas where some magical or psionic effect caused a significant amount of
tiny glass crystals to be mixed in with the sand. They’re slippery <em>and</em> sharp,
requiring an Athletics check from any who enters them to avoid falling prone and
taking damage.</p>

<h2 id="tree-of-life">Tree of Life</h2>

<p>These extremely rare plants are imbued with a much greater than usual amount of
vital energy, which enables them to resist and even recover from defiling
attempts given enough time. Ironically, this makes them extremely valued by
sorcerer-kings and other powerful and rich defilers, which cultivate them for
use as batteries.</p>

<p>I think earlier editions kept a more or less precise list of the remaining trees
of life in Athas - they were <em>that</em> rare. In this edition, I believe their
number is less restricted, but the most likely place you’re going to find one is
still in the “boss room” for these defilers.</p>

<p>Trees of life emit a 5-square aura. Creatures within always regain the maximum
possible HP from variable healing effects, and have a +5 to perform divination
rituals.</p>

<p>Whenever someone performs Arcane Defiling inside the aura, or use some other
necrotic power that damages one of their allies, the tree takes the damage
instead. Trees have 500 HP and Vulnerable 10 Necrotic, and die when they
hit 0. They regenerate 5 HP per hour.</p>

<h2 id="ztal-horde">Z’Tal Horde</h2>

<p>A much funnier and more mundane piece of terrain! Z’tals are tiny, slimy, stinky
lizard-bug-things that gather in very large swarms. They’re relatively harmless,
but still a bother.</p>

<p>A z’tall horde fills one or more squares, which are difficult terrain. Someone
who ends their movement in such a square takes 5/tier poison damage from the
stink. Someone who starts their turn in a horde square must roll a save before
taking any other actions. A failure means they fall prone because of the
slippery slime. A close or area attack that deals at least 1 point of damage
will automatically disperse a horde square with no roll required.</p>

<p>They’re sometimes bred as living security measures, but a horde of these
annoying scavengers might naturally form around the corpse of any large
creature.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This is your one stop shop for generating horribly mutated varieties of standard
monsters. The name “Sunwarped” comes from the belief that these mutations are
caused by Athas’ scorching sun, but there are many different causes. These
creatures might have been exposed to concentrated psionic energy, lived for too
long in defiled areas, or been victims of terrible experiments.</p>

<p>The Pristine Tower is also a prime source of mutated monstrosities, altering any
who linger near it for too long. To hear people talk about it, it was the <em>only</em>
such source in previous editions, but now it’s just one more among many.</p>

<p>Sunwarped creatures are obviously misshapen when compared to typical
specimens. They might be exceedingly assymetrical, have extra limbs or eyes, and
so on. These descriptors give me a kind of “science fantasy” vibe, because they
match what you would expect radiation to do in 50s-style atomic horror tales.</p>

<p>Anyway, sunwarped creatures get a +2 to Endurance, and might also get one or two
<strong>Sunwarped Traits</strong> in addition to their extra theme powers. These traits
usually give it an extra bonus in one area and a small penalty in another. There
is a table here with some examples, but the GM is free to come up with others.</p>

<p>So a creature might get digging claws that give it climb and burrow speeds equal
to its base speed, but also reduce that base speed by 1. Or uneven eyes that
give it all-around vision but inflict a -3 penalty to ranged and area
attacks. Or something that gives +1 to one defense and -1 to another.</p>

<p>All of these changes are situational, and their effectiveness depends entirely
on the monster they get applied to. A Brute with no ranged attacks will find
those uneven eyes to be a pure bonus, while an extra limb that aids in grappling
would be wasted on an artillery monster. While you can min-max and only give
monsters traits that increase their power, you can also do the opposite to show
how random these mutations can be.</p>

<h2 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h2>

<p>The split is pretty clear in this theme - attack powers either deal damage or
apply debuffs to others.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Breath of the Blazing Sun</strong> probably has this name because almost no one in
Athas would know what radiation is. It’s a Close Blast 4 vs. Fortitude that
blinds its targets and makes them vulnerable to radiant and fire damage (save
ends both).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Burning Blood</strong> will make xenomorph fans happy, as it represents a
high-pressure jet of hazardous blood spraying out when the creature is
hit. This is a reaction that makes a Close Blast 3 attack vs. Reflex, and
inflicts ongoing acid + fire damage (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ravaging Fury</strong> is a free action encounter power, meaning it can be used in
the creature’s own turn without spending actions. Once this is used, if the
creature hits with its next attack it will immediately gain an action point
that it can use before the end of its next turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sticky Hide</strong> makes the monster be constantly covered in goo. Any enemy that
hits the creature with a melee attack is subject to an attack vs. their
Reflex, and if that hits the weapon used on the attack gets yanked out of
their hands and and sticks to the monster’s slimy coating. Recovery is
automatic but requires staying adjacent to the monster and spending a standard
action.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>These heal of buff the creature itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enraged Growth</strong> makes the monster grow one size category when first
bloodied! It pushes anyone adjacent to make room, and gains 10 temporary
HP/tier. This gets more awesome when you apply it to a monster that is already
big.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Feast on Flesh</strong> causes the creature’s melee basic attack to give it 5/tier
temporary HP on a hit as it consumes some of the target’s flesh. The book
itself says that while you’d expect to see this only for bite attacks, you can
add it to any attack and come up with a suitably freaky explanation for why it
works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Misshapen Body</strong> means the creature’s important anatomical bits are not
where you’d expect them to be, so it can roll a d20 when it takes a critical
hit, downgrading it to a normal hit on a result of 10+. These are the same
mechanics of a normal save, but since they’re written out in full I guess it
means it doesn’t <em>count</em> as a save, so wouldn’t get general save bonuses such
as those of an elite or solo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can also make such misshapen creatures <strong>Steady-Footed</strong>, letting them
also roll actual saves against falling prone because their weird shape ends up
being more stable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I get a very strong “atomic horror” vibe from this theme, except it’s happening
in a setting where people don’t know about radiation, and so the mutations get
blamed on other causes.</p>

            <p>As we all know by now, psychic powers are very common in Athas. Anyone might
have some, even if that’s not their main specialty. For PCs, this is implemented
as a couple of character themes (Noble Adept and Wilder).</p>

<p>For NPCs and monsters, we have the Psionic Adept theme presented here. You can
add this to a non-psionic monster to make it more controller-ish.</p>

<p>Psionic Adepts gain a +2 to either either Diplomacy and Intimidate (force of
personality!) or to Insight and Perception (sixth sense!).</p>

<h2 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h2>

<p>Following the usual design strategy of adding new abilities that work “around”
established attacks, we get a collection of powers that hinder and debuff
enemies. All of the ones that require attack rolls target Will.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blind the Mind’s Eye</strong> (recharge 5+) is a ranged attack that makes the
creature invisible to the target (save ends). This ends when the creature
attacks the target. Lurkers can use this to enable their big attacks, while
others can use it as a way to ease pressure on themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Empathic Wall</strong> (recharge 6+) creates a 12-square wall that lasts a turn. It
blocks line of sight. People can cross it, but its squares are difficult
terrain, and anyone inside them is lightly obscured.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mantle of the Mind</strong> (encounter) is a close burst 4 that attacks will and
prevents affected targets from targeting the creature with their attacks (save
ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mental Marionette</strong> (encounter) is a sustainable domination power. It
dominates for a turn on a hit, but can be sustained with standard actions to
let the creature repeat the attack against the same target, potentially
prolonging the domination. On a miss, it dazes for a turn. It’s a little
weaker than a fire-and-forget (save ends) power, because it eats up standard
actions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three variants of <strong>Psionic Augmentation</strong> that add a little extra something
when the creature hits with a melee basic attack. One deals extra psychic
damage, the other dazes for a turn, and the third one inflicts ongoing psychic
damage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>These are a lot more clearly “utilities” than the ones for elemental
creatures. They’re all encounter powers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mental Bastion</strong> is an interrupt that gives a +4 to Will, potentially
turning a hit into a miss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Open the Mind’s Eye</strong> gives blindsight 5 and all-around vision for a
turn. The latter means the creature cannot be flanked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Oracular Empathy</strong> is a weird one. When an nearby ally of the creature is
hit by an attack, the creature can use a reaction to switch its initiative
order to be just after the attacker’s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Psionic Flight</strong> automatically pushes each adjacent enemy 1 square and lets
the creature fly its speed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Pretty cool! It seems more thematically tight to me than Elementally
Infused. Adding these powers to someone like an ogre would be a nice/nasty
surprise.</p>
