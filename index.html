          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2026/02/20/review-gurps-gun-stats.html">Review: GURPS Gun Stats</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Imagine the following situation: you want to feature a certain gun in your
campaign, but you want to do it “properly”. You’re not the kind of GM who would
feel good about just tossing some random numbers in there.</p>

<p>The weapon in question is not in any of your books, and it’s different enough
from the ones that are that you can’t just reskin an existing gun. That’d be the
same as using random numbers.</p>

<p>If the story above resonated with you, then you’ll love GURPS Gun Stats. It
gives you an official system to write up GURPS 4th Edition stats for guns
starting from their real world data. If the lack of these rules stopped you
before, you’ll love this book.</p>

<p>Sure, players who were really into statting up guns might already have been
doing this for years by either building them using the rules from GURPS Vehicles
for 3rd edition, or by using a <a href="https://gamingballistic.com/2022/04/11/old-ballistics-spreadsheet-a-repost/">very scary unofficial spreadsheet</a> cooked up
by Douglas Cole for his own use. Gun Stats is still useful for them, as it’s
much simpler than the spreadsheet.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-looks">How It Looks</h2>

<p>This is a typical Warehouse 23 PDF. All black and white, with the by now
classical GURPS two-column layout. Its written by David Pulver with additional
material by S.A. Fisher Hans-Christian Vortisch, which is kind of a seal of
quality in itself when it comes to gun-nut material in GURPS.</p>

<p>The interior art is mostly a mix of illustrations clearly based on photos or 3D
models with a weird “acid etching” surface filter applied to them to unify the
look. You also have a few hand-drawn illustrations. The art credits are fairly
long, listing several photo repositories and 3D studios in addition to a couple
of individual artists. I admit the “acid etching” filter made me take a closer
look, but I believe all the art in this book is either drawn or edited by human
hands.</p>

<p>The Totally-Not-From-Assassin’s Creed lady on page 9 has a bit of an awkward
pose, but it’s organic awkwardness. The rest of the pieces are fine, and look
good without getting in the way of the text.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>

<p>One thing I found nifty about the book is that it’s more than a collection of
formulas. It has some instruction on how to actually do the research to get that
real-life gun data, and a little checklist. You’ll need things like the empty
weight, barrel length and overall length of the gun itself; the weight and
dimensions of its projectile and of the whole cartridge; and how much propellant
it uses per shot.</p>

<p>Some of those stats (like the weights and costs) can be written straight into
the stat sheet, while others are used in relatively simple equations to derive
stuff like damage, Accuracy, and range.</p>

<p>And that’s it. While those simple calculations can still be a little intense
they’ll get you the results you want.</p>

<p>At the end of the book you have a printable checklist for your own research, and
three example weapons: a French anti-material rifle, a 19th-century 6-pounder
cannon, and the gun on the M1A2 Abrams tank.</p>

<h2 id="caveats-and-annoyances">Caveats and Annoyances</h2>

<p>The book works best when dealing with historical or modern guns that have ample
information available to the public, whether in Wikipedia, more specialized
sites, or even sales brochures. The less information is available for a specific
weapon, the more you’ll have to guesstimate when filling your checklist.</p>

<p>You can already see this with the Abrams tank gun here. Recent data about it and
its ammunition is classified, so they either use Gulf War-era information or
just make educated guesses about some of its measurements.</p>

<p>Fictional guns will often be harder, because they very often lack a lot of
measurements entirely, as those weren’t necessary to tell the story. You’ll have
to come up with those yourself, or maybe go looking for the work of other fans
who have already spent a ton of time doing exactly that.</p>

<p>This is all perfectly doable, but presumably you wanted this book because you
didn’t want to guess all the numbers. On the other hand, doing this will give
you a pretty good ideas of the ways in which this or that fictional weapon is
unrealistic.</p>

<p>A final annoyance for me specifically: like all other GURPS books, this one uses
Imperial measurements exclusively for its calculations. Yes, even though modern
gun data is often presented in metric. You gotta convert all of that to feet,
pounds, and inches before doing the work, which is doubly annoying to me because
I’m going to convert a lot of that right back for the final writeups.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>GURPS Gun Stats gives me the same impression as a classical UNIX or Linux
command line tool. It’s designed to do one job, it does that job pretty well
despite some usability issues, and it has a lot of options that can be difficult
to remember without looking at the documentation.</p>

<p>If you need to do that job, this is the tool for you, and the learning curve is
worth it. If you’re happy to just toss some eyeballed stats onto a table and
call it a day, then you can skip it.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Continuing our read of the Hazards section, we’ll now see a few Wilderness
hazards. These are all naturally occurring, and most are extra-dangerous
versions of the terrain we saw earlier.</p>

<h2 id="wilderness-hazards">Wilderness Hazards</h2>

<h3 id="chokedust-cloud-level-2-lurker">Chokedust Cloud (Level 2 Lurker)</h3>

<p>A more dangerous version of the stuff you might find in ash wastes, silt pools,
and deserts with particularly fine sand. This is a 3-by-3 area of particularly
fine and powdery stuff, and the slightest disturbance will cause it to form a
cloud.</p>

<p>Characters can roll Perception to notice the area is different, and if they pass
that first test they can roll an easier Nature one to learn exactly why.</p>

<p>The hazard triggers when someone steps into the area, or when a portion of it is
included in a blast or burst attack. The entire area erupts into a choking cloud
that attacks the Fortitude of those standing on it. On a hit it blinds and
inflicts ongoing 5 damage (save ends). The cloud stays around after this -
victims cannot save against its effects while they remain inside. I imagine it
also attacks anyone who steps into it after this.</p>

<p>Characters can roll Acrobatics when moving into the area to avoid disturbing it,
and they can roll Endurance to steel themselves and gain a +2 to Fortitude
against the cloud’s next attack.</p>

<h3 id="badlands-tremor-level-5-lurker">Badlands Tremor (Level 5 Lurker)</h3>

<p>A small localized earthquake. It has four epicenter squares scattered through
the encounter area. The GM can either roll randomly or place them for maximum
inconvenience.</p>

<p>Characters can roll Perception to listen for the groaning noise that precedes
the tremor, and then Nature to identify it as an incoming earthquake and (with a
good enough roll) where the epicenters are.</p>

<p>The tremor starts when the encounter does - roll initiative for it. On its
initiative count, a random epicenter makes a Close Burst 5 attack vs. Reflex
that damages and knocks prone on a hit, half on a miss, and makes its area
difficult terrain.</p>

<p>The only countermeasure is an Acrobatics check on your turn to brace yourself
for the next tremor. Staying away from the tremor areas also works, but it might
not be feasible depending on the map’s layout.</p>

<h3 id="silt-sink-level-8-lurker">Silt Sink (Level 8 Lurker)</h3>

<p>A much more dangerous version of the Silt Pool terrain from before. This is a
4-by-4 squares wide, 30-foot deep hole filled with silt.</p>

<p>It takes a Perception roll to notice the ground is different, and then a Nature
check to realize this is a deep pit that could bury someone.</p>

<p>If someone steps onto the pit’s area, they suffer an attack against their
Reflex. On a hit they take fall damage (3d10, as if the pit was empty), and then
get immobilized and begin to take ongoing 5 damage until they escape.</p>

<p>An escape attempt requires a series of Athletics or Acrobatics check against the
pit’s escape DC. Each success causes the victm to rise 10 feet towards the
surface. If they’re still in the pit at the end of their turn, they remain
immobilized however. So it takes 3 successes for someone to fully escape.</p>

<p>Another character can try to help the victim if they can find a way to reach
them (such as with a long branch or pole), using a move action to automatically
pull them up by 10 feet.</p>

<h3 id="devil-dune-level-9-obstacle">Devil Dune (Level 9 Obstacle)</h3>

<p>A huge pile of loose sand that is currently being pushed by the winds and moving
at a surprisingly high speed. This could be a natural phenomenon, or it could be
the work of an angry spirit.</p>

<p>It can be automatically noticed, and there’s a Nature check to realize it’s
dangerous. The dune rolls Initiative, and on its turn it shifts 4 square towards
the nearest creature. When it enters a creature’s space, it can attack their
Reflex to try to engulf them. This damages, slows, inflicts ongoing 5 damage,
and obscures vision beyond 2 squares (save ends all). On a miss, it just slows
for a turn.</p>

<p>Someone who starts their turn entirely inside the dune takes an attack against
their Fortitude, which deals heavy damage and restrains. It takes an escape
roll, not a save, to get out of the sand.</p>

<p>The only countermeasure, other than staying the heck away, is the option to roll
Acrobatics as an interrupt before the dune attacks your Reflex. The result of
the roll becomes your new defense against that attack, even if it was lower than
your Reflex.</p>

<h3 id="false-oasis-level-13-elite-lurker">False Oasis (Level 13 Elite Lurker)</h3>

<p>This 6-by-6 square area looks like an oasis, but it’s actually an
illusion. Behind it is a 2-by-2 area filled with blood-sucking creeper plants,
which counts as blocking terrain. Sounds like just the kind of thing a group of
sand brides would set up.</p>

<p>An Insight check might let someone recognize the oasis as an illusion, but not
identify what it hides. A harder Arcana test can do both.</p>

<p>If someone gets to within 3 squares of the illusion’s borders, the hazard rolls
initiative. On its turn, the creepers reach out and try to pull the victim, an
attack against AC that deals no damage and pulls the target 2 squares. This can
target up to three creatures, so it not being an opportunity attack is actually
an advantage. There’s enough time for multiple victims to approach the sweet,
sweet illusion.</p>

<p>If a character starts their turn adjacent to the actual creeper squares, they’re
targetted by an opportunity action that attacks their Fortitude and, on a hit,
weakens and inflicts ongoing 10 necrotic damage (save ends). On a miss, it deals
5 necrotic damage.</p>

<p>If you can’t pierce the illusion or staying away is not an option, you can
destroy the false oasis with violence (105 HP, vulnerable 15 radiant).</p>

<h3 id="dust-funnel-level-15-blaster">Dust Funnel (Level 15 Blaster)</h3>

<p>A tornado, more or less.</p>

<p>Roll Initiative for the hazard when combat starts, and choose a square on the
battle map. On its first turn, the dust funnel manifests in a Close Burst 2
around that square, and takes up that much space.</p>

<p>A Perception or an easier Nature test can identify this spot as the forces build
up, before the funnel manifests.</p>

<p>On its turns, the funnel moves 1d10 squares and makes an attack against anyone
who happens to be in its area. On a hit, it damages, knocks prone, and
immobilizes its targets (save ends). Until the target passes a save, they get
dragged along with the funnel whenever it moves. Of course, targets who get
dragged along will suffer the attack again next turn, since they will be in
reach of it.</p>

<p>Imagine if this thing manages to grab <em>every other combatant</em>, monsters and PCs
alike. That’d be hilarious.</p>

<p>Characters can make a hard Nature check to figure out where the funnel will move
in its next turn, and if they can’t escape its path they can spend a standard
action to grab onto something and get +4 to all defenses against its next
attack.</p>

<h3 id="desert-glass-level-17-obstacle">Desert Glass (Level 17 Obstacle)</h3>

<p>We already saw what an even mix of sand and powdered glass can do. This is a
stretch of ground that’s mostly pure glass, in much bigger chunks. It’s super
slippery and cuts you to ribbons if you fall.</p>

<p>The hazard covers 20 contiguous squares, in any configuration the GM wants. All
of them are difficult terrain. If they’re not obvious, such as if there’s a
thin layer of sand over them, they can be identified with a Perception test.</p>

<p>Anyone who enters, starts their turn, or stands up from prone on one of these
squares takes an attack against Reflex that damages, knocks prone, and inflicts
ongoing 10 damage (save ends). It the target was already prone, they are dazed
for a turn instead.</p>

<p>If one or more squares of the glass are included in an area attack that has the
cold, thunder, or force keywords, the affected squares make a Close Burst 1
attack that deals the same amount of immediate and ongoing damage as the other
one, and then disappear. They got shattered and blew up.</p>

<h3 id="venomous-spines-level-21-blaster">Venomous Spines (Level 21 Blaster)</h3>

<p>These are from a species of tree that grows on some of the rare jungle biomes of
Athas. When someone gets near, the tree forcibly ejects an omni-directional
cloud of venomous spines.</p>

<p>A Perception check can notice there’s something funny about that tree. A Nature
check can identify it before the PCs enter its range.</p>

<p>The attack hits a Close Burst 5 around the tree, dealing heavy poison damage and
making a secondary attack that on a hit blinds and inflicts ongoing 5 poison
damage (save ends). On a miss, it deals half damage.</p>

<p>Someone who knows the tree is dangerous can close in without triggering it with
an Acrobatics or Stealth check. They can then use hard Nature checks to reduce
the size of the burst by 2 per successful check, entirely “disarming” the tree
with the third success. I’m guessing they’re plucking the spines.</p>

<h3 id="defiled-plain-level-24-obstacle">Defiled Plain (Level 24 Obstacle)</h3>

<p>A patch of ground so thoroughly defiled it’s not just dead, it’s
“undead”. Anyone stepping on it will have their life force drained.</p>

<p>A Perception check can tell the ground is unnatural, and an Arcana check can
identify its danger.</p>

<p>The attack deals heavy necrotic damage and inflicts vulnerable 10 to all damage
(save ends). The first failed save causes the target to lose a healing surge,
and the second one makes the vulnerability <em>permanent</em> until cured by a ritual
like Remove Affliction. A miss deals half damage.</p>

<p>A character near or on the affected area can make a hard Arcana check to
neutralize it for a turn. Characters without Arcane Defiling powers or abilities
have a +2 on this test. Those who have these take a -2 instead. A preserver
(which I assume means someone without those abilities) can choose to spend 2
healing surges to destroy the hazard, which I guess means they can restore some
of the place’s lost life. The book says those healing surges can only be
regained through an extended rest, which feels redundant but I guess means no
other trick that would normally allow an early recovery can do so.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These hazards are generally scarier versions of the terrain we saw earlier, so
they’re certainly appropriate for inclusion in battles taking place in that
terrain.</p>

<p>And that’s it for the book! I hope you enjoyed the reading. I’m trying to think
of what to do next, so any suggestions are welcome.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As I mentioned in a <a href="/octopus-carnival/2025/12/22/lphr-background-change.html">post back in December</a>, I’ve been actually playing this
solo game in a sporadic fashion for years. And as I said back when I started, I
planned to post it here. So why didn’t I?</p>

<p>Basically, it was anxiety over art.</p>

<p>The first thing I was going to do was to post the stats for my player
characters, and since these were going to be “proper blog posts”, I decided I
wanted to have illustrations for them just like I have for all the other
characters I posted before.</p>

<p>My method of procuring them was going to be the same. I’d use search indexes and
trawl some specific art sites for published images I could add to the post, with
proper credit and a link to the original.</p>

<p>For certain characters, that’s dead easy. But for a couple of others I ended up
never finding an image that <em>exactly</em> matched what I wanted. Or when I did find
one that had the right vibe, it turned out the artist explicitly forbade this
kind of usage, even with proper credit. Also one of my sources was Pinterest and
I had just learned that one site had a serious “proper credit” issue. Whoops!
What to do?</p>

<p>I know exactly what suggestion is already forming in a lot of your brains right
now, and I’m gonna stop y’all right there and say “no”. I’m not using AI for
this, or anything else. Not now, not ever.</p>

<p>So after way too long you’ll get those posts without illustrations at all. I
can’t draw, but I can write, so you’re getting verbal descriptions. And maybe
then I can finally proceed with publishing this.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Even if the stuff we saw on our previous post was pretty hazardous, none of it
counts as a “hazard” in mechanical terms.</p>

<p>The main difference is that Terrain is entirely passive. It might do something
when you step on it, or it might allow a character to perform some special
action when next to it, but it never <em>initiates</em> any interaction.</p>

<p>Hazards, on the other hand, have enough “agency” to count as a monster for
encounter building purposes. They can make attacks, and can also be disabled by
the methods outlined in its description. Traps are the most popular example of
hazards, but these rules can also model dangerous terrain features that weren’t
built to do harm on purpose. Obviously, unlike real monsters, traps and hazards
don’t use tactics. They just follow their “programming”.</p>

<p>Traps and hazards have their own set of roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blasters</strong> make ranged or area attacks. A crossbow trap is the most popular
example.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lurkers</strong> can disappear for a while after making their attacks, so dealing
with them is harder. A blade trap that retracts into the wall is a good
example.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Obstacles</strong> impede movement, both by their presence and with attacks that
slow the target down. They might block passage entirely or require characters
to make tricky movement or puzzle-solving skill checks to pass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Warders</strong> are alarm systems. They can have damaging attacks too, and will
make them as soon as they detect intruders, but their main function is to warn
others about the presence of those intruders. The alarm might only sound once,
or keep sounding while the hazard persists. In truth, this seems to be kind of
a catch-all category. If the hazard can’t conceal itself after attacking and
doesn’t really impede movement, it’s a warder. A shrieker mushroom is a
non-damaging example.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the summarized descriptions below, I always start with a description of the
hazard’s nature and appearance, what it does when triggered, and how to avoid or
disable it.</p>

<h2 id="arena-hazards">Arena Hazards</h2>

<p>This subsection details hazards that might be found in the many gladiatorial
arenas of Athas. They’re placed on purpose to make things more “interesting”,
but they’re not really <em>traps</em> per se.</p>

<h3 id="worthy-sacrifices-of-draj">Worthy Sacrifices of Draj</h3>

<p>This is a 3-by-6 square pile or corpses with their hearts torn out. <em>Animated</em>
corpses, that will try to grab, pull, and gnaw on anyone they sense nearby. It’s
a Level 8 Obstacle.</p>

<p>PCs can notice the corpses are animated with Perception or Religion. The pile
makes opportunity attacks that damage and grab against any character who steps
adjacent to it. Roll Initiative for it after the first such attack. On its
turn, it will try to pull any grabbed victims into itself, dealing the same
damage as the initial attack and inflicting ongoing 10 necrotic damage while the
victims remain inside.</p>

<p>A PC can choose to make an Acrobatics test when they step adjacent to the pile
to avoid the opportunity attack. They can disable it either by good old
fashioned violence (70 HP, resist necrotic, vulnerable radiant), or by
improvising an exorcism with Nature and Religion. This is a complexiy 1 skill
challenge where each failure deals 5 necrotic damage to the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="blood-trees-of-gulg">Blood Trees of Gulg</h3>

<p>These are large trees with red leaves. The main arena in Gulg has about a dozen
of these planted in a semi-random arrangement. Their trunks completely fill a
square and count as blocking terrain. Their branches stretch 3 squares in every
direction from the trunk.</p>

<p>The rumor that these trees have red leaves because they feed on blood is
false. The leaves are naturally red, and the trees are mostly harmless. They
only turn carnivorous when they’re about to bloom, you see.</p>

<p>There’s no fixed blooming season - the timing for that is rather random. For
this specific arena, at most 3 trees might be dangerous at a time. The rest are
still blocking terrain, of course.</p>

<p>Blood Trees are level 9 Warders. Their presence is obvious, and a Nature or
Perception check can allow a PC to notice that a given tree is “primed” and what
its reach is (it’s 3).</p>

<p>When someone steps into that reach, the tree makes an opportunity attack that
damages and knocks prone on a hit. On its turn, it apparently uses another set
of branches to make attacks against Fortitude to damage, poison and fling away
anyone it hits with those. That’s ongoing 5 poison (save ends), plus a secondary
attack that makes a 5-square push on a hit.</p>

<p>Blood trees can be destroyed by violence (100 HP, resist 10 poison); and a PC
can succeed at a Nature check when stepping into their reach to avoid the
opportunity attack and be ignored by the tree for the rest of the encounter.</p>

<h3 id="obsidian-façades-of-urik">Obsidian Façades of Urik</h3>

<p>The arena in Urik is a former pit from an obsidian mine. Its walls are wickedly
sharp and good enough at absorbing heat that by noon the arena resembles a huge
natural air fryer. Guess when fights take place.</p>

<p>Characters inside the arena are exposed to Sun Sickness, a disease detailed in
the Dark Sun Campaign Setting that probably represents heat stroke and
dehydration. The walls are a variable level Obstacle, and moving adjacent to
them subjects the character to an attack that deals mixed physical and fire
damage that rises with tier. Characters doing so on purpose can attempt an
Acrobatics check to avoid this.</p>
