        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This is your one stop shop for generating horribly mutated varieties of standard
monsters. The name “Sunwarped” comes from the belief that these mutations are
caused by Athas’ scorching sun, but there are many different causes. These
creatures might have been exposed to concentrated psionic energy, lived for too
long in defiled areas, or been victims of terrible experiments.</p>

<p>The Pristine Tower is also a prime source of mutated monstrosities, altering any
who linger near it for too long. To hear people talk about it, it was the <em>only</em>
such source in previous editions, but now it’s just one more among many.</p>

<p>Sunwarped creatures are obviously misshapen when compared to typical
specimens. They might be exceedingly assymetrical, have extra limbs or eyes, and
so on. These descriptors give me a kind of “science fantasy” vibe, because they
match what you would expect radiation to do in 50s-style atomic horror tales.</p>

<p>Anyway, sunwarped creatures get a +2 to Endurance, and might also get one or two
<strong>Sunwarped Traits</strong> in addition to their extra theme powers. These traits
usually give it an extra bonus in one area and a small penalty in another. There
is a table here with some examples, but the GM is free to come up with others.</p>

<p>So a creature might get digging claws that give it climb and burrow speeds equal
to its base speed, but also reduce that base speed by 1. Or uneven eyes that
give it all-around vision but inflict a -3 penalty to ranged and area
attacks. Or something that gives +1 to one defense and -1 to another.</p>

<p>All of these changes are situational, and their effectiveness depends entirely
on the monster they get applied to. A Brute with no ranged attacks will find
those uneven eyes to be a pure bonus, while an extra limb that aids in grappling
would be wasted on an artillery monster. While you can min-max and only give
monsters traits that increase their power, you can also do the opposite to show
how random these mutations can be.</p>

<h2 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h2>

<p>The split is pretty clear in this theme - attack powers either deal damage or
apply debuffs to others.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Breath of the Blazing Sun</strong> probably has this name because almost no one in
Athas would know what radiation is. It’s a Close Blast 4 vs. Fortitude that
blinds its targets and makes them vulnerable to radiant and fire damage (save
ends both).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Burning Blood</strong> will make xenomorph fans happy, as it represents a
high-pressure jet of hazardous blood spraying out when the creature is
hit. This is a reaction that makes a Close Blast 3 attack vs. Reflex, and
inflicts ongoing acid + fire damage (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ravaging Fury</strong> is a free action encounter power, meaning it can be used in
the creature’s own turn without spending actions. Once this is used, if the
creature hits with its next attack it will immediately gain an action point
that it can use before the end of its next turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sticky Hide</strong> makes the monster be constantly covered in goo. Any enemy that
hits the creature with a melee attack is subject to an attack vs. their
Reflex, and if that hits the weapon used on the attack gets yanked out of
their hands and and sticks to the monster’s slimy coating. Recovery is
automatic but requires staying adjacent to the monster and spending a standard
action.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>These heal of buff the creature itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enraged Growth</strong> makes the monster grow one size category when first
bloodied! It pushes anyone adjacent to make room, and gains 10 temporary
HP/tier. This gets more awesome when you apply it to a monster that is already
big.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Feast on Flesh</strong> causes the creature’s melee basic attack to give it 5/tier
temporary HP on a hit as it consumes some of the target’s flesh. The book
itself says that while you’d expect to see this only for bite attacks, you can
add it to any attack and come up with a suitably freaky explanation for why it
works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Misshapen Body</strong> means the creature’s important anatomical bits are not
where you’d expect them to be, so it can roll a d20 when it takes a critical
hit, downgrading it to a normal hit on a result of 10+. These are the same
mechanics of a normal save, but since they’re written out in full I guess it
means it doesn’t <em>count</em> as a save, so wouldn’t get general save bonuses such
as those of an elite or solo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can also make such misshapen creatures <strong>Steady-Footed</strong>, letting them
also roll actual saves against falling prone because their weird shape ends up
being more stable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I get a very strong “atomic horror” vibe from this theme, except it’s happening
in a setting where people don’t know about radiation, and so the mutations get
blamed on other causes.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As we all know by now, psychic powers are very common in Athas. Anyone might
have some, even if that’s not their main specialty. For PCs, this is implemented
as a couple of character themes (Noble Adept and Wilder).</p>

<p>For NPCs and monsters, we have the Psionic Adept theme presented here. You can
add this to a non-psionic monster to make it more controller-ish.</p>

<p>Psionic Adepts gain a +2 to either either Diplomacy and Intimidate (force of
personality!) or to Insight and Perception (sixth sense!).</p>

<h2 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h2>

<p>Following the usual design strategy of adding new abilities that work “around”
established attacks, we get a collection of powers that hinder and debuff
enemies. All of the ones that require attack rolls target Will.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blind the Mind’s Eye</strong> (recharge 5+) is a ranged attack that makes the
creature invisible to the target (save ends). This ends when the creature
attacks the target. Lurkers can use this to enable their big attacks, while
others can use it as a way to ease pressure on themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Empathic Wall</strong> (recharge 6+) creates a 12-square wall that lasts a turn. It
blocks line of sight. People can cross it, but its squares are difficult
terrain, and anyone inside them is lightly obscured.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mantle of the Mind</strong> (encounter) is a close burst 4 that attacks will and
prevents affected targets from targeting the creature with their attacks (save
ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mental Marionette</strong> (encounter) is a sustainable domination power. It
dominates for a turn on a hit, but can be sustained with standard actions to
let the creature repeat the attack against the same target, potentially
prolonging the domination. On a miss, it dazes for a turn. It’s a little
weaker than a fire-and-forget (save ends) power, because it eats up standard
actions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three variants of <strong>Psionic Augmentation</strong> that add a little extra something
when the creature hits with a melee basic attack. One deals extra psychic
damage, the other dazes for a turn, and the third one inflicts ongoing psychic
damage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>These are a lot more clearly “utilities” than the ones for elemental
creatures. They’re all encounter powers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mental Bastion</strong> is an interrupt that gives a +4 to Will, potentially
turning a hit into a miss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Open the Mind’s Eye</strong> gives blindsight 5 and all-around vision for a
turn. The latter means the creature cannot be flanked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Oracular Empathy</strong> is a weird one. When an nearby ally of the creature is
hit by an attack, the creature can use a reaction to switch its initiative
order to be just after the attacker’s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Psionic Flight</strong> automatically pushes each adjacent enemy 1 square and lets
the creature fly its speed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Pretty cool! It seems more thematically tight to me than Elementally
Infused. Adding these powers to someone like an ogre would be a nice/nasty
surprise.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Athas is a world particularly close to the Elemental Chaos, and so there are
lots of places in it that are soaked in elemental energies of some kind. The
creatures that inhabit these areas often end up elementally-infused.</p>

<p>The book suggests changing the creature’s origin to elemental if its mutations
end up being inheritable, though that just affects the lore and so it’s just
necessary if it will affect the game’s stories in some way.</p>

<p>The main mechanical thing you must decided about an elementally-infused creature
is its element. All of its powers that deal damage have it written as “[damage
type]” in the book, and you’re meant to replace that lacuna with a type
corresponding to the creature’s associated elements: one of fire, acid, cold,
thunder, or lightning (very very frightening!).</p>

<p>Not all of its attacks need to do the same type of damage. Multi-element
elementals are a thing now, after all. And you might decide to make one or more
of these attacks untyped, which would be common for an earth elemental whose
rock-based attacks deal physical damage for example.</p>

<p>Elementally-infused creatures get +2 to Intimidate and Athletics.</p>

<h2 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h2>

<p>All of these powers deal damage of the type you chose above.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are two <strong>Elemental Auras</strong>, one that triggers when the monster is
bloodied and damages enemies inside, and one that is always active and makes
enemies vulnerable to your chosen element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Eruption</strong> causes an explosion when the monster is first bloodied,
a close burst 2 that targets Reflex and deals elemental damage equal to the
monster’s best basic attack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Manifestation</strong> converts the damage of all of the monster’s
attacks to your chosen element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Persistence</strong> is recharge 5+ and inflicts 5/tier ongoing damage of
the chosen type when the monster hits with a melee attack. It’s said to
increase “damage output and entertainment value”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>The most obvious here is <strong>Elemental Damage Resistance</strong>, which should be high
enough for the monster to resist its own attacks (or I guess 5/tier if you don’t
want to do math). If a monster’s attacks are untyped, you could give it
variable resistance instead.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the others deal damage, proving that the “attack”/”utility” split
is more of a guideline here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Dissipation</strong> lets the monster vanish from play for a turn and
reform next to an enemy, dealing a bit of damage and making them grant combat
advantage for another turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Ground</strong> is a third aura variant, this time meant to keep enemies
close. The aura’s radius becomes difficult terrain and enemies take damage
when they leave it, instead of when they enter it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Step</strong> deals elemental damage to anyone who hits the monster with
an opportunity attack while it moves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Transport</strong> lets the monster teleport between patches of hazardous
terrain that deal damage of the chosen type. Clever!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mutable Body</strong> is appropriate for water-based or otherwise gooey monsters,
and lets the creature count as one size smaller when squeezing through narrow
openings.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>You want elemental damage? We got elemental damage! I like the design strategy
of additional attack powers that modify and work around the monster’s usual
attacks, and it works particularly well here.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>What’s a Monster Theme? The concept was first introduced in Dungeon Master’s
Guide 2, and it’s a way to give a set of monsters a shared look and feel. This
involves changes to their mechanics and lore, but unlike monster <em>templates</em>
from the DMG 1, it doesn’t change their “quality”. Regulars remain regulars,
elites remain elites, and so on.</p>

<p>Monster themes end up being more flexible than templates, since the monster
creation rules are good enough to handle any level or quality changes by
themselves.</p>

<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-monster-theme">Anatomy of a Monster Theme</h2>

<p>Each theme has a fairly involved presentation. You get some explanation for the
lore attached to that theme and how it might modify a monster. Then a line about
skill changes that might apply, and finally a big list of powers.</p>

<p>Those powers are divided between Attack Powers and Utility Powers - you pick one
of each category to add to the monster’s stat block. Nothing else about its
basic stats changes, unlike with a template. If you want those to change, you
can use the standard monster creation and “editing” rules to change the
monster’s level or quality.</p>

<h2 id="our-first-theme-arena-bred-monster">Our First Theme: Arena Bred Monster</h2>

<p>Blood sport arenas are the most popular entertainment in all city states, and
monster fighting is one of its most popular modalities. It’s common to throw
recently captured wild animals into the ring, but a monster that was
specifically prepared for the spectacle is a much bigger draw. Animals are
specifically bred for the role; people receive special training. And both might
be further modified by magic or psionics, all in the service of providing a more
brutal and spectacular fight.</p>

<p>Monsters with this theme get a +2 to Intimidate and a +2 to either Athletics or
Acrobatics.</p>

<h3 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h3>

<p>Despite the name of this category, the powers here tend to avoid having specific
attack or damage figures, to better enable them to apply to monsters of any
level.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Berserk Passage</strong> (recharge 5+) lets a monster make two basic attacks and
shift half its speed at any moment in this sequence, passing through enemy
spaces. It usually goes on monsters that have been made mad with hunger and
pain before being dropped into the arena, though I supposed it could also be
used to represent an agile duelist humanoid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bleeding Attack</strong> is a triggered power that inficst 5/tier ongoing damage
(save ends) when the monster bloodies a target. It might represent serrated
weapons or claws. The book recommends making it (recharge 5+) for elites or
solos; by default, it’s at-will.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Brutal Flourish</strong> lets the monster make a free melee basic attack whenever
it bloodies or defeats an enemy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Death Burst</strong> means the monster has been rigged to explode! This is visible
to the PCs and should be described appropriately. This power is common for
monsters that have received some sort of combat implant, but could be applied
even without that. By default this happens when the monster hits 0 HP, but for
elites and solos it could also happen when the monster is first bloodied,
where it might be combined with some other change in its stats as those
implanted bits fall off. The explosion is a Close Burst 2 with attack and
damage figures appropriate to the monster’s level.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Retaliating Stride</strong> (recharge 5+) is a move action that lets the monster
move its speed and deal damage to any creature that hits it with an
opportunity attack during this move. It can represent showy counterstrikes, or
maybe something like implanted spikes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Attached Weapons</strong> are not written up like a power, but discussed in general
terms inside a text box. Many arena monster handlers like to implant extra
weapons on their charges through magic. This is an excuse for your to add
extra attack powers that monsters of that type don’t normally have. For
example, an artillery monster could receive implanted melee weapons that give
it a stronger than usual melee attack, or a brute could get an unusually
accurate ranged weapon. It’s common for these weapons to break or fall off
when the monster is bloodied - and this can also be combined with Death Burst
variants.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h3>

<p>These are generally the fruit of long experience in the arena, representing
cunning, resilience, and luck.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Intervening Armor</strong> represents an ability to leverage the normally useless
piecemeal armor that covers gladiators by shifting so enemy attacks hit the
tiny plates. It’s an Interrupt that gives +2 to AC or Reflex when the monster
is hit by an attack targetting one of these defenses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Necessary Betrayal</strong> is for treacherous gits who developed the habit of
abusing their teammates’ trust. If the monster is hit by a melee or ranged
attack while adjacent to an ally, it can swap places with the ally as an
interrupt, and have the ally take damage from the attack instead. You don’t
compare the attack roll against the ally’s defenses - just apply the damage
directly. This power cannot be nice even by accident.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shake it Off</strong> represents the ability to quickly recover one’s wits in a
bout. Whenever subject to an effect that a save could possibly end, the
monster can roll a save to end it as a reaction, even if this specific
application cannot be ended with a save. (So it works against “dazed until the
end of the next turn”, but not against “dead”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Turn the Tables</strong> is a defense against forced movement. If pushed, pulled,
slid, or knocked prone, the creature can trigger this reaction to stand up (if
prone) and shift 2 squares.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think it’s interesting how many of the powers here can be either applied to a
berserk beast of a flashy humanoid fighter that uses finesse and agility, with
the final mechanical result being the same.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>We’re past the monster lists, but there’s still a fair amount of book to
cover. Its final third is dedicated to Encounter Options, and the first
subsection of that is a small lesson on Customizing Monsters.</p>

<p>The gist of it is that when you want to bring a “generic” D&amp;D monster to Athas,
you should change them a little to make them fit the more brutal and desperate
tone of the setting. In other words, you should make them Darker and Sunnier.</p>

<p>The next page has a few tips on how to do that. First, you should keep the
monster recognizable, since it both keeps things a little familiar and makes
the differences stand out that much more. And then you can apply one or more of
the customization guidelines they suggest, each with an example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No change</strong>: Some monsters already fit the aesthetic and could just be
dropped in where you need them. Gnolls and bullettes, for example.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Altered Appearance</strong>: Some monsters need a little extra make-up to fit the
visual style of Athas. You’ll rarely find traditional mammals here for
example, but you could have equivalent creatures that have carapaces, scales,
and bony plates instead of soft fur. Hill giants might look more rocky, with
skin matching the colors of the surrounding terrain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Altered Environment</strong>: Creatures that live in frozen or aquatic biomes in
their original forms could be changed to live in the desert wastelands of
Athas instead. Sure, the aquatic ones could live in oases, but turning them
into sand-burrowers can be a “nice” surprise for the players.</p>

    <p><strong>Alternative Lore</strong>: This most important for creatures whose lore has
extensive ties to the Astral Sea and divine magic, both of which are mostly
inaccessible in Athas. Eidolons are one example, and they’d need to be changed
to be tied to arcane or primal magic instead unless they’re relics from when
the gods were still around. Angels and the like should also be reskinned
unless your entire game revolves around the mystery of why they appeared.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New Powers</strong>: New mechanical abilities might be just the thing to make a
given creature Darker and Sunnier. This should mostly be handled through
Monster Themes, which are discussed in the next page.</p>

<h2 id="sample-converted-monsters">Sample Converted Monsters</h2>

<p>These two are given as examples, and in some cases are also stealth updates to
the originals, using the new Monster Manual 3 math.</p>

<h3 id="silt-shark">Silt Shark</h3>

<p>Based on the Fleshtearer Shark from the Monster Manual 2, this creature occupies
a similar niche to the bullette, with slightly different abilities. Its
water-based traits were replaced with sand-themed equivalents, and it’s been
given training in Athletics to make higher jumps. It “swims” through sand and
loose soil.</p>

<p>The Silt Shark is a Large Natural Beast and a Level 10 Brute with 128 HP. It has
a ground speed of 5, and a burrow speed of 8, with low-light vision and
Tremorsense 10.</p>

<p>The original shark’s Aquatic trait has been replaced with <strong>Silt Swimmer</strong>,
which lets the shark shift and charge while burrowing, and gives it a +2 damage
bonus while burrowing against any creature without a burrow speed. It cannot
burrow through solid stone, however.</p>

<p>The shark has a basic <strong>Bite</strong>, and a <strong>Lockjaw Charge</strong> maneuver that deals the
same damage and grabs on a hit. While the shark has a grabbed victim, it can
automatically deal damage to them with <strong>Shredding Teeth</strong>. And once the grab
ends, the victim takes ongoing 5 damage (save ends).</p>

<p>If the shark starts its turn within 5 squares of a bloodied creature, it enters
a <strong>Feeding Frenzy</strong>, and makes a free attack against a creature adjacent to
it. If it was grabbing someone, it releases them first.</p>

<h3 id="ssurran-dune-mystic">Ssurran Dune Mystic</h3>

<p>This is a Greenscale Marsh Mystic from the Monster Manual, modified into a
Ssurran version. The swamp theme of the original’s abilities has been switched
to a sand and desert theme, its Constitution was increased a little, and its
basic attack has been given a push rider to match the Ssurran Shaman from that
entry.</p>

<p>We end up with a Level 6 Controller (Leader) with 72 HP and a ground speed of 6
with Earth Walk. It has a <strong>Sun Blessing</strong> aura (5) that heals 3 HP to any ally
that stats their turn inside, and fights with a <strong>spear</strong> that damages and
pushes 2 squares on a hit.</p>

<p>The mystic also has a couple of fireball-style combat spells: <strong>Salt Cloud</strong>
(recharge 5+) deals poison damage and dazes for a turn; <strong>Sand’s Grasp</strong>
(encounter) is non-damaging, but it immobilizes (save ends) and creates a zone
of difficult terrain that lasts for the rest of the encounter.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>It’s quite likely that anyone who still actively plays D&amp;D 4th Edition is
experienced enough at reskinning monsters that they don’t really need this
advice. Nevertheless, it’s still good to see it printed, and with worked
examples to boot.</p>
