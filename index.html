<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Dagorrans are carnivorous reptilian quadrupeds the size of large dogs. They can
track prey by its “psychic scent”, which they can memorize either through direct
contact or by stumbling into a creature’s psychic trail (i.e. through
psychometry). Once a dagorran has its chosen prey’s scent, they will chase it
relentlessly, across great distances, until they catch it.</p>

<p>In the wild, these creatures live in wide-ranging packs. Dagorran packs sleep
for a handful of hours every couple of days, and spend the rest of their time on
the hunt. They only stay at a single place for a while when they have to rear
their young, but as soon as the pups can run with the pack they’re on the move
again. Unlike some of the other magical beasts in the book, dagorran packs don’t
cooperate with other predators.</p>

<p>Young dagorrans are sometimes captured and trained by templars, who prize them
as peerless trackers and use them to track fugitives or wanted
dissidents. They’re much better at this job than cilopses, who must lay eyes on
the prey to start tracking and can only follow the trail for a short time.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Dagorrans share some similarities with baazrags (dog-like pack hunters) and with
cilopses (favored templar pets), but they’re a lot more dangerous with levels in
the mid-Paragon tier. They’re Natural Magical Beasts so we can consider them
sapient, though I guess their thought processes are pretty alien. The creatures
can understand Common, and they can communicate telepathically with other
dagorrans but not with anyone else.</p>

<p>They have a ground speed of 8, low-light vision, and the <strong>Psychic Scent</strong>
signature trait. This is a minor-action power that lets them choose a living
creature <em>or its tracks</em> within 10 squares of the dagorran. The dagorran can
ignore any level of concealment or invisibility on its chosen target, and knows
the creature’s location until it either dies or the dagorran uses the power
again. No wonder templars like them.</p>

<h3 id="dagorran-mindhound">Dagorran Mindhound</h3>

<p>These robust specimens charge in packs to surround and distract their chosen
prey, opening them up for attack by their sneakier relatives (below). They’re
Level 16 Brutes with 194 HP.</p>

<p>Their only attack is a <strong>bite</strong> that does respectable brute-tier damage, but
that and Psychic Scent are enough to make them a threat.</p>

<h3 id="dagorran-ambusher">Dagorran Ambusher</h3>

<p>These sneaky specimens move a bit ahead of the pack and position themselves for
an ambush, striking once their beefier relatives (above) begin their own part of
the attack. They’re Level 17 Lurkers with 132 HP.</p>

<p>Ambushers deal extra psychic damage against any creature that cannot see
it. This trait is somewhat confusingly named <strong>Combat Advantage</strong>. I mean, if
you cannot see the ambusher you will most likely be granting it CA, but if you
can see it you won’t take bonus damage even if you’re granting it CA for other
reasons.</p>

<p>That difference will soon cease to matter, however, because their <strong>bite</strong> makes
them invisble to the target for a turn on a hit. If they’re too far away to
bite, they can use their standard action to <strong>Fade to Nothingness</strong> and become
invisible either until they attack, or until the end of their next turn.</p>

<p>It’s a classical lurker setup, but the rider on their bite attack means that
they can keep biting you with bonus damage for as long as they keep hitting.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Dagorran encounters are simple. A wild pack is an all-dagorran encounter. You
can also find one or two of them as part of a Paragon-tier templar encounter.</p>

<p>Dagorrans feel a lot more “dog-like” than baazrags lore-wise, but not
mechanics-wise as they lack the ability to knock people prone or any Pack
Tactics style power. I think they work better as pets brought in by mixed
humanoid encounter groups, since those can be more varied than a wild pack. A
chase scene or skill challenge involving dagorrans is a much more drawn-out
affair than one involving cilopses, as the PCs will likely have to kill or
discourage the dagorrans before they can attempt to lose their pursuers.</p>

<p>I did find a bit surprising that they’re mid-Paragon monsters, but their stat
blocks are simple enough that you could reduce their level by 10 or so and still
have them work just fine as Heroic threats.</p>

<p>Crodlus are what Athas has instead of horses. Fans of Final Fantasy might
compare them do Darker and Sunnier chocobos.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In the wild, crodlus roam the wastes in small herds of about a dozen members,
led by a dominant female. Females make up most of the other members of the herd,
and are all related to the leader. One of the males will be the leader’s mate,
with the others being mostly younger individuals who have not yet reached
adulthood. When that happens, the newly adult males set out to seek mates in
other herds.</p>

<p>The creatures are omnivores, with herds cooperating to hunt those creatures they
judge to be weaker or smaller than themselves, and running away from stronger
predators. They’re also frequently beset by human raiders trying to capture
their young for training as mounts.</p>

<p>This means that crodlu are a common sight among groups of sapient
humanoids. They make for ornery mounts, but that’s a good trait to have in
something you want to ride into battle.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Crodlus are Large Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag and a ground speed of 8.</p>

<h3 id="crodlu">Crodlu</h3>

<p>This could represent a typical wild specimen, or perhaps a domesticated one that
wasn’t trained as a mount. It’s a Level 3 Brute with 55 HP.</p>

<p>The crodlu can attack with its <strong>beak</strong> or with <strong>claws</strong> that do a little less
damage. Whenever it can it will use a <strong>Pounce</strong>, which lets it move up to its
speed, and use both Beak and Claws against the same target even if it stands
still. If both attacks hit, the target falls prone.</p>

<h3 id="war-crodlu">War Crodlu</h3>

<p>This one was trained as a mount, and compares to the normal crodlu in the same
way a war horse compares to a draft animal. It’s a Level 5 Brute with 76 HP.</p>

<p>The War Crodlu has the same three abilities described for the normal version,
and one more: <strong>Pouncing Mount</strong>. If the war crodlu charges a target while
mounted, its rider can make a melee basic attack as a free action against that
same target. The Pounce ability does <em>not</em> count as a charge, but this makes the
charge of a mounted war crodlu a bit more dangerous than a standard Pounce,
depending on who the rider is.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Crodlus don’t strike me as the type of animal who’d attack wandering PCs without
provocation, so they’ll mostly likely be found serving as mounts for bad guys or
for the PCs themselves. Fighting wild ones would be something that happens when
the PCs decide to play hunter and steal hatchlings to sell or domesticate.</p>

<p>Mechanically they’re very simple, about on par with horses really. I’ve been too
desensitized by FF chocobos to see terror bird mounts as a mind-blowing
innovation, but they’re still kinda cool.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Cloud rays look like gigantic flying stingrays, and are among some of the rarest
and most majestic specimens of Athasian fauna. They float in from the Sea of
Silt to feed or rest, and despite their prodigious size they’re rarely dangerous
unless bothered.</p>

<p>These creatures subsist mostly on psychic, entropic, and magical energy, so they
only need a comparatively tiny amount of physical food to keep going. They land
on the ground to sleep, covering themselves in sand and debris for
camouflage. There are many stories about travelers who pitched their tents on a
nice spot of high ground only to later find themselves desperately clinging to
the back of a cloud ray when the creature took flight.</p>

<p>Cloud rays dream of distant places when they sleep, and sometimes they disappear
to those places instead of taking flight the usual way. When threatened, the
creature can consciously tap into this ability to teleport short distances.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Cloud Rays are Elemental Beasts, whose size varies depending on their age. They
can crawl on the ground at speed 4 and fly at Speed 12 with Hover
capability. They have an affinity for storms, with Resist 15 Lightning and
Thunder.</p>

<p>We’re going through the entries here in increasing order of level, which is the
reverse of what the book does.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-ray-pup">Cloud Ray Pup</h3>

<p>This young individual is Large, translucent, and relatively delicate for its
size. It’s a Level 21 Minion Skirmisher. Pups fly around in clusters near other
creatures that can provide them with food - most commonly cloud ray elders, but
sometimes other aerial predators that tend to leave lots of left-overs. If their
intended prey is still moving, they sting it until it stops, and then set down
to eat.</p>

<p>Their <strong>sting</strong> is Reach 3 and deals thunder damage. They can employ it as part
of a <strong>Gliding Attack</strong> that lets them move their speed and make the attack at
any point along the way. They don’t provoke opportunity attacks when moving away
from the target of their sting.</p>

<p>As a minion, a single hit will take the pup down, but it can use <strong>Dream
Resurgence</strong> once per encounter to remove itself from play when it reaches 0 HP
and reappear at the start of its next turn within 10 squares, with its 1 HP
restored. It will probably use this opportunity to run away if nothing is
forcing it to stay, so the PCs don’t need to feel bad about giving this
beautiful creature a good whack to get it to bother someone else.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-ray-adult">Cloud Ray Adult</h3>

<p>Adults cruise the skies continuously, only descending to rest or to attack
land-bound prey. Sure, it eats little for its size, but for a Huge creature that
can still mean its infrequent meals consist of a whole person or similarly sized
animal. Adults are Level 23 Elite Skirmishers with 424 HP.</p>

<p>The adult has a much stronger version of the pup’s <strong>Sting</strong>, with Reach 4. It
can also use a Reach 1 <strong>bite</strong> that deals more damage and grabs the
target. Targets grabbed by the bite have a -4 to their escape rolls, which have
escape DCs of 34 for Athletics and 36 for Acrobatics. The ray can grab at most
one target like this. The <strong>Unhindered</strong> trait lets the cloud ray pull the
victim along when it moves. Either of these attacks can be used as part of
<strong>Gliding Attack</strong>, which lets it attack twice during the movement and otherwise
works like the pup’s version.</p>

<p>A ray that finds itself surrounded can use <strong>Wing Storm</strong> (Close Burst 3
vs. Fort, recharge 5+) to deal thunder damage and push targets 3 squares on a
hit, also knocking them prone. This creates a lightly obscured zone that lasts
for a turn, from all the dust it kicks up.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, while bloodied, the ray can use <strong>Dream Flight</strong> to teleport
15 squares, carrying its grabbed victim with it if it has one. It makes Close
Burst 2 attack vs. Fortitude on arrival, dazing an slowing those it hits.</p>

<p>A grabbed victim can be attacked with further bite attacks and with <strong>Crush</strong>, a
minor action attack vs. Fortitude that deals as much damage as the bite.</p>

<p>An adult on the hunt will try to grab its chosen prey and fly away, biting and
crushing the victim until it’s dead. If their prey proves too feisty, they’ll
drop it from a great height to soften it up, and then grab it again. Repeat
until done.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-ray-elder">Cloud Ray Elder</h3>

<p>This majestic Gargantuan beast is a Level 25 Solo Controller, on par with elder
dragons from other worlds. Its control over storms lets it project an aura (3)
of <strong>Undulating Winds</strong>, which deals 15 thunder damage to enemies that start
their turns inside and lets the elder slide them 3 squares to another square
within the aura.</p>

<p>Also, its <strong>Flat Body</strong> lets other creatures enter and occupy the elder’s
space - they’re standing on top of the ray! This means it’s equal parts enemy
and terrain during a fight. If it took flight because you tried to camp on its
back, it will be the <em>only</em> terrain for the fight.</p>

<p>Obviously if you’re on top of the ray, you’re also inside its aura, so it will
try to slide you off its back. This follows the rules for forced movement into
hazardous terrain, so you get a save to grab on before you tumble to the
ground. If you pass, you end up prone at the ray’s edge.</p>

<p>The elder’s is Reach 5 <strong>Sting</strong> deals immediate and ongoing thunder damage
(save ends). Its favorite attack enhances the sting with magic for a <strong>Thunder
Lash</strong>, which deals physical damage to its primary target and triggers a
secondary close burst 5 centered on that target that deals thunder damage to all
enemies it hits and pushes then 3 squares. On a miss it deals half damage.</p>

<p>It’s also large enough that its bite upgrades to <strong>Scooping Bite</strong>: this is a
Close Blast 5 instead of a melee attack, and it can grab up to three targets it
hits. <strong>Unhindered</strong> is here and lets the elder fly away with its mouthful of
victims. <strong>Gliding Menace</strong> works like Gliding Attack, but lets the elder
specifically use Thunder Lash and Scooping Bite as its two flyby attacks.</p>

<p>Like the adult, the elder can <strong>Crush</strong> its grabbed victims with a minor
action. Fortunately they don’t have penalties on their escape rolls, but the
base DCs are higher since the elder is higher level.</p>

<p>If bloodied, the elder uses <strong>Dream Flight</strong> to teleport away. It works just
like the adult’s version, but the daze upgrades to Stunned on the first failed
save and Unconscious on the second.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Cloud Rays are almost always only found together with other cloud rays, with a
flock of pups following a group of adults or a single elder around. They’re not
sapient but I think they’re smart enough not to attack heavily armed PCs without
provocation. Encounters are more likely to start when a PC runs into a ray at
rest, and even then a fight is not certain.</p>

<p>I imagine you can have a good adventure about PCs trying to prevent another
armed group from killing cloud rays, and in this case the creatures would <em>not</em>
be smart enough to distinguish the PCs from the hunters if a fight broke out.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The cilops (not to be confused with the cyclops) is the Darker and Sunnier
version of Ye Olde Giante Centipede. That means it’s larger, spikier, and has
psychic powers. Their name comes from the huge single mammal-like eye they have
instead of the more usual compound eyes you find in arthropods.</p>

<p>Unlike other monstrous centipedes, the bite of the cilops is not venomous. The
touch of its antennae, however, can psychically paralyze victims or muddle their
minds. They can also psychically track victims over short distances - it’s very
hard to hide from these things once they caught your scent.</p>

<p>In the wild, cilopses gather in the same places you can find mundane
centipedes - any area where there’s a reasonable amount of shade and
water. You’re more likely to find them <em>outside</em> of the wild, however, as
Templar patrols from every city love to use trained cilopses as both trackers
and attack animals.</p>

<p>Some templars or sorcerer-kings are also fond of raising particularly large and
vicious specimens and letting them loose on the city to wreak some havoc and
terrorize the population into compliance.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Cilopses are Large Natural Beasts. They have Darkvision, some sort of antenna
power that varies with the stat block, and the signature power <strong>Follow Psychic
Trail</strong>. This is a minor-action encounter power that lets them choose a creature
they can see. Until the end of the encounter that creature grants combat
advantage to the cilops, and cannot hide from it.</p>

<p>The combat advantage is pretty useful during a fight, but remember that a skill
challenge to run away from a cilops-equipped patrol is also an encounter. Don’t
let they catch your scent!</p>

<h3 id="cilops-creeper">Cilops Creeper</h3>

<p>A typical specimen such as one might find in the wild, or accompanying a templar
strike force. It’s a Level 5 Skirmisher with 60 HP. It has ground and climb
speeds of 7, and Resist 5 Psychic.</p>

<p>All of the creeper’s attacks deal 1d6 extra damage if it has <strong>Combat
Advantage</strong>, which is yet another reason for not letting it track you. Its basic
<strong>bite</strong> damages on a hit and lets the creeper shift 2 squares as an
effect. Once per encounter it can use its <strong>Paralyzing Antennae</strong> against a
creature granting combat advantage to it, targetting Fortitude. On a hit this
damages, dazes, and immobilizes the target for a turn.</p>

<p>Creepers really want to start tracking a specific PC as soon as the fight
starts, and then focus fire on their chosen victim starting with an antennae
attack and then proceeding to spam the bite.</p>

<h3 id="cilops-stalker">Cilops Stalker</h3>

<p>A chunky terror weapon, the Stalker is a Level 7 Elite Skirmisher with 154
HP. It’s slower and less agile than the Creeper, with a ground speed of only 6
and no climb speed or psychic resistance. However, it makes up for that in bulk.</p>

<p>The Stalker’s <strong>pincers</strong> have the same bonus against targets granting CA, and
its <strong>Sudden Rush</strong> maneuver (recharge 5+) is excellent against tight
formations. It allows the Stalker to shift its speed and move through enemies
space during this shift. Whenever it does so, it makes a melee attack vs. the
enemy’s Reflex, dealing heavy damage and knocking prone on a hit.</p>

<p>It can still only <strong>Follow Psychic Trail</strong> once per encounter, but unlike the
Creeper it can use its Reach 2 <strong>Dazing Antennae</strong> once per round with no
targeting restrictions. This does lightning damage equivalent to the bite on a
hit, and dazes for a turn.</p>

<p>The Stalker also wants to track and focus on one target, and Sudden Rush lets it
reach that target even through the party’s defender front line.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, you’re much more likely to encounter these things being used
as trackers and attack animals by templars than to meet them in their natural
habitats. If you do meet them in the wild, they’re likely to be accompanied by
other varieties of giant bug, or by swarms of smaller ones.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they’re giant centipedes with a bit more character, and I imagine
they can get pretty annoying when paired with other teammates that specialize in
tying PCs down and preventing them from helping the cilops’ chosen victim.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Chathrangs are big carnivorous tortoises with built-in anti-air artillery. The
many spiny protusions on their shells are tubes that can spit out sticky
envenomed quills, with or without a tether that lets them reel in their
catch. Their usual hunting method is to hide in an oasis amid natural reeds or
other plants, wait for small birds or large insects to fly overhead, and shoot
them.</p>

<p>If no suitable flying critters are present, they’ll go for land-based prey. They
tend to become too enthusiastic or desperate at these times, and might try to
reel in something they can’t handle. Like a PC, for example.</p>

<p>Chathrangs usually live and travel in groups of about three. They don’t have a
lot of combat ability outside of their one neat trick, so it’s common for them
to enter symbiotic relationships with other creatures to share prey in exchange
for a bit more protection. When hurt, they behave like other tortoises and hide
inside their shells.</p>

<p>Charthrangs are impossible to train, but some people keep them around to “milk”
their venom. If a battle against their keepers ends up bursting into the
charthrang enclosure, the creatures will follow their instincts.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>These critters are Medium Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag and a stately
ground speed of 4. They’re Level 9 Artillery with 81 HP, so I guess even a
monster described as “relatively weak” rates high-Heroic stats in this world.</p>

<p>The creature’s <strong>Spiny Shell</strong> acts as an aura (1) that deals 5 damage to anyone
who starts their turn inside, but they charthrang doesn’t really want PCs to get
that close. Instead, it wants to stay far away and shoot its Range 20 <strong>spine
shots</strong>, which do poison damage on a hit. The beast can increase its rate of
fire and use a <strong>Spine Volley</strong> instead, attacking two targets with one action.</p>

<p>Attaching a sticky strand to a spine turns it into the <strong>Poisoned Tether</strong>
attack, which does the same damage and immobilizes the target. While immobilized
by this attack, the target cannot be pushed, pulled, or slid by anything other
than the <strong>Reel In</strong> minor action, which pulls it 5 squares. Escape requires
either passing a save as normal, or teleporting.</p>

<p>If the charthrang is damaged by an attack, it can <strong>retreat into its shell</strong> as
a reaction. Until the end of its next turn it’s slowed, can’t attack, gains a +5
to AC, and doubles the damage done by its aura.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Aside from the standard encounter disposition mentioned in the lore, chatharangs
are also very amenable to reskinning. If you read the Cactus entry and felt that
you needed cactus artillery to complement the lurkers, you can just replace
Reptile with Plant on the chathrang stat block and call it a day. Describe them
as big spherical cacti that move by rolling around and otherwise behave the
same.</p>

<p>The mechanics are interesting. Range 20 is a lot! A cluster of three of these
machine-gun tortoises can sit very far back behind a line of 2-4 soldiers or
brutes and wreak havoc on the PCs by directly targeting their squishies, and
reeling them towards Team Monster’s frontline. Multiple charthrangs can stick
their tethers to the same PC and alternate their use of Reel In to bring the
victim closer that much faster, too.</p>

<p>That is, of course, if the GM plays them smart. This is absolutely not required,
as these are simple animals with a reputation for trying to catch things too
dangerous for them to handle.</p>

<p>Still… anti-air tortoises. What a world.</p>
