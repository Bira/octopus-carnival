<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Dark Sun is still a D&amp;D setting. Therefore it needs giant spiders.</p>

<p>Athasian giant spiders behave much like their kin from other worlds. They prefer
locations that afford them plenty of hiding and ambush spots like caves, deep
valleys, and so on. While neither of the varieties presented here can spin webs
fast enought to do so during combat, they still might cover entire chasms or
large passages in them as they wait for more prey to wander by.</p>

<h2 id="crystal-spider">Crystal Spider</h2>

<p>One of the prettiest monsters in the Tablelands, its carapace is made of actual
crystal. Aside from the usual venomous bite and their razor-sharp appendages,
crystal spiders also have smome power over light and are capable of radiant
attacks.</p>

<p>Crystal Spiders are Large Natural Beasts and Level 4 Lurkers with 39 HP. Their
ground and Spider Climb speeds are both 8, and they have Tremorsense 10 to
detect people touching their webs. Their carapace makes gives them Resist 5
Radiant, but also Vulnerable 5 Thunder.</p>

<p>It also gives them the <strong>Gleaming Carapace</strong> trait, which gives them concealment
until the end of their next turn any time they move more than 5 squares in the
same action. I guess glare is a major problem with fighting crystal spiders on
their home turf.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a decently damaging <strong>Razor Leg</strong> (melee 2), and they can
use a <strong>bite</strong> (melee 1 vs. Fort) against a target that cannot see them, dealing
both immediate and 10 ongoing poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Crystal spiders could achieve that unseen state by moving more than 5 squares
and hiding, but they have a couple of shortcuts in the form of their
light-bending powers. <strong>Radiant Agony</strong> (close burst 2 vs. Fort) pushes its
targets 3 squares and blinds them for a turn, recharging whenever no one is
blinded or when the spider hits with its bite. <strong>Brilliant Ray</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Ref, recharge 5+) does a good chunk of radiant damage and blinds for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="crystalline-web">Crystalline Web</h3>

<p>Any place where crystal spiders hunt will be filled with these razor sharp
traps. They’re statted up as Level 4 Obstacles, each consisting of a patch of
webbing 4x4 squares in size, stretched between two surfaces. They’re
semi-transparent and require a DC 14 Perception check to notice in bright light,
or 19 in dim light.</p>

<p>When a character enters a web square, the web attacks their Reflex, doing
immediate and ongoing 5 physical damage on a hit (save ends). Hit or miss, the
target’s movement ends and it gets pushed back to the last square it occupied.</p>

<p>A character can use Acrobatics (DC 14) to move through a webbed square, or they
can attack the web and deplete its 25 HP to destroy it.</p>

<p>An elite version of this trap has 50 HP instead, and deals increased damage when
it catches someone. In either case, good luck dodging these in dim light or
while blinded by the crystal spiders who made them!</p>

<p>The book doesn’t explicily state it, but I would say crystal spiders should be
immune to the effects of their own webs.</p>

<h2 id="white-widow">White Widow</h2>

<p>White Widows are a bigger, stronger, and <em>stealthier</em> relative of the crystal
spider. While they lack the ability to fire lasers, they still have some control
over light and like to blind their prey. They’re Huge Natural Beasts and Level
15 Lurkers with 110 HP, resist 10 poison and radiant, and Vulnerable 10
thunder. Their speed and senses are the same as a crystal spider.</p>

<p>The reason white widows like to blind their prey is that they deal 15 ongoing
“poison and radiant” damage (save ends) when they hit blinded targets with any
attack. Yes, this means their venom is deadly even to things that are normally
resistant or immune to poison. This trait is named <strong>Combat Advantage</strong> but
that name is misleading, as it only grants its benefit against <em>blinded</em>
targets.</p>

<p>The spider’s <strong>bite</strong> is a basic attack that also deals “poison and radiant”
damage, but it’s not going to be used on its own unless conditions are
right.</p>

<p>Instead of biting it can turtle up and use its <strong>Reflective Defense</strong>, which
gives it a +5 bonus to all defenses for a turn and blinds anyone who misses them
with an attack during that time. The <strong>Scuttling Attack</strong> maneuver (recharge 5+)
lets it shift half its speed, bite someone, and shift the other half.</p>

<p>When hit by a fire, radiant or lightning attack (in other words, anything shiny)
the spider can react with the <strong>Venomous Dawn</strong> attack, enhancing and reflecting
that light back at its attackers. This is a Close Burst 5 vs. Reflex, deals
radiant damage, and blinds (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="widows-web">Widow’s Web</h3>

<p>Any battle against white widows will happen in a place filled with
these. They’re not sharp like a crystal spider’s, but they’re still quite
dangerous as Level 15 Obstacle traps.</p>

<p>White widow web patches are 10x10 squares in size and require a DC 22 Perception
check to notice in dim light, but are automatically visible in bright
light. The web attacks the Reflex of anyone who enters one of its squares, and
restrains on a hit (save ends). Webbed squares are also difficult terrain to
anyone without the Spider Climb ability.</p>

<p>Characters can avoid the trap by leaping over webbed terrain, or destroy the web
by dealing 40 HP of damage to it. An elite version has double the HP and can
take two opportunity attacks per turn, which is useful in case two or more
targets get pushed into it in the same action.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>You’ll mostly commonly be meeting these spiders singly or in pairs, with the
rest of the encounter balance being made up of web patches. They can appear
anywhere you would expect to find the standard varieties of D&amp;D giant spider,
which also exist in Athas because why wouldn’t they?</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Silt Runners are basically Athasian Kobolds. While they’re not described as
“savage”, all of the usual kobold slander is also present here. They’re small
reptilian humanoids who are intensely xenophobic and whose entire society is
based on raiding other humanoid settlements. They wield stolen weapons and wear
bits of clothing and body parts from their victims as trophies, eating the rest.</p>

<p>The main differences here seem to be that Silt Runners are more related to
ssurrans (Athasian lizardfolk) than to dragons, and that they’re much more
nomadic and aggressive. They gather in warrens linked by tunnels and located
near their prospective raid targets, but are quick to abandon those hideouts
when their targets attempt a retaliatory strike.</p>

<p>For some reason, silt runners hate the fey, and have been known to ignore far
more vulnerable targets in favor of attacking well-protected elves and eladrin.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Silt Runners are low-level and fit right alongside kobolds as Small Natural
Humanoids with the Reptile tag. But while standard kobolds have the Shifty
trait, Silt Runners have <strong>Silt Runner Swarm</strong>, which causes any enemy adjacent
to 2 or more silt runners to take 2 damage at the start of their turn. They also
have low-light vision and a surprisingly zippy ground speed of 7.</p>

<h3 id="silt-runner-darter">Silt Runner Darter</h3>

<p>These Level 1 Artillery menaces have 25 HP and wield blowguns with an assortment
of darts. They keep to the edges of the battle and shoot whoever they can.</p>

<p>The <strong>Blowgun</strong> deals standard damage and has Range 12, so they can keep a fair
distance away from the scrum. Some of their shots will be with <strong>Poisoned
Darts</strong> (recharge 5+), which deal heavy poison damage and immobilize (save
ends). As an aftereffect, the target is slowed (save ends). A miss deals half
damage and slows for a turn, which is very strong for a rechargeable attack.</p>

<p>If engaged in melee, they can defend themselves with <strong>Wooden Daggers</strong>, but
those are nothing to write home about.</p>

<h3 id="silt-runner-rager">Silt Runner Rager</h3>

<p>Ragers are Level 1 Brutes with 34 HP. The <strong>Bone Spears</strong> they wield look
comically large, but have Reach 2 and are very effective. In addition to
standard attacks, they can use them in <strong>Brutal Spear</strong> maneuvers that deal
increased damage and recharge when first bloodied, or in a <strong>Penetrating Spear</strong>
maneuver that also deals increased damage and makes the target Vulnerable 5 to
all damage for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="silt-runner-inciter">Silt Runner Inciter</h3>

<p>This one is a Level 2 Controller with the Leader tag and 38 HP. If they had a PC
class, they would be Ardents, as they have psionic powers capable of causing
strong emotions on their allies - fury, in this case.</p>

<p>Inciters can make a decent show of themselves in melee with their <strong>Bone
Swords</strong>, and they can attack at range with a <strong>Psionic Detonation</strong> (area 1
within 10, recharge 6+) that deals force damage and creates a zone that lasts
for a turn and is difficult terrain for enemies.</p>

<p>They can also <strong>Incite Fury</strong> in a close blast 5, causing each ally within the
blast to shift 1 square and make a free basic attack either before or after the
shift. When first bloodied, they can do that again as a free action, <em>and</em>
Incite Fury recharges, which means they could use this power a total of three
times per encounter.</p>

<p>Inciters want to drop that difficult terrain zone as soon as possible and then
have their allies swarm the PCs caught inside so that Incite Fury is maximally
effective.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Silt Runners mostly stick together, but will sometimes cooperate with other
reptilian humanoids, and keep reptilian beasts as pets.</p>

<p>So yeah, they’re Athasian Kobolds. You can easily take standard kobold stat
blocks, increase their speed to 7, and replace Shifty with Silt Runner Swarm to
increase your collection of silt runner stat blocks.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2025/10/19/recap.html">Dungeon Fantasy &quot;Monster&quot;: Recap</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I’m going to write this in the same format I use for my Monster Manual Let’s
Reads, even though it’s not really a “monster”.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These plump mushrooms are a about a foot tall when fully grown, and have purple
caps. They’re very distantly related to shriekers, but their abilities are much
more specialized.</p>

<p>When someone disturbs a recap, the mushroom scans the person’s memories and
loudly summarizes the most important events of the last week or so of their
lives.</p>

<p>“Most important” here is defined by what’s foremost in the target’s minds. Yes,
they do have a tendency to spill closely held secrets that are big sources of
anxiety or regret for the victim. Some believe recaps they were originally
developed by an underground civilization with a strong tradition in psionics to
act as interrogation tools. Nowadays you can find them in the wild inside caves
and other damp and dark places, like many dungeons.</p>

<p>At least one investigator on the surface is known to carry a potted recap around
in a specially built cage, using it for its original purpose when questioning
suspects.</p>

<p>Even if the victim manages to resist the mind reading attempt, the recap
will still speak a bunch of unconnected nonsense words for a minute or so. Those
who are mainly concerned about noise should refrain from touching them at all.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Recaps aren’t “monsters” in a literal sense. Despite their radio-announcer
voices, they’re nonsapient and immobile. A good whack with any weapon will
destroy your typical recap. In GURPS, it has SM -5, DR 0, and 1 HP.</p>

<h3 id="wild-recap-cluster">Wild Recap Cluster</h3>

<p>In the wild, recaps grow in clusters and work like traps. Clusters are usually
on the ground, but might also grow on walls or ceilings. If one mushroom in the
cluster is disturbed by a touch at least strong enough to jostle it, the whole
cluster “activates” and performs its narration as one big speaker. Actual damage
also counts, of course - if a damaging attack leaves at least one recap
standing, it will activate on the next turn.</p>

<p>A recap cluster takes up 1 hex and has the following stats.</p>

<p><em>Detect</em>: Clusters are usually big enough to be plainly visible. Roll
<strong>Naturalist</strong> at -2 to identify the mushrooms as recaps.</p>

<p><em>Disarm</em>: No. Attacks that deal at least 6 damage to the whole hex at once will
completely destroy all the recaps before they can activate. Anything less will
trigger them.</p>

<p><em>Avoid</em>: <strong>DX</strong> at -5 or <strong>Light Walk</strong>. The <strong>Silence</strong> spell will render the
cluster harmless for as long as it lasts.</p>

<p><em>Save</em>: Quick Contest of <strong>Will</strong> against skill 16 to avoid having your mind
read. <strong>Magic Resistance</strong> helps.</p>

<p><em>Effect</em>: About a minute of loud noises. If the target won the contest of Will,
this will be a string of nonsense words. If they lost, the recap will summarize
the previous week of their lives as if it was the last episode of a radio
serial, potentially airing some dirty laundry.</p>

<p><em>Shots</em>: Constant.</p>

<p><em>Rearm</em>: No.</p>

<p><em>Steal</em>: Roll against <strong>Naturalist</strong> to harvest one large, healthy recap
specimen per hex. This weights 1 lb. and is worth $1000 if delivered intact to
the right people back in town.</p>

<h3 id="recap-inquisitor">Recap Inquisitor</h3>

<p>This consists of a large, healthy recap specimen planted on good soil in a clay
pot, surrounded by small but sturdy iron cage with large gaps between the
bars. It’s used by the “right people” back in town or by unscrupulous villains
in interrogations. They just need to ask (or force) the subject to poke the
mushroom.</p>

<p>The subject must win a quick contest of <strong>Will</strong> against a skill of 16 to
prevent the ‘shroom from narrating all their dirty laundry from the past seven
days. It will speak a string of nonsense words if the subject resists, and
experienced handlers will know what that means. The cage offers DR 7 against
swinging attacks and other impacts (such as dropping the device), but the large
gaps mean it doesn’t protect against thrusting ones.</p>

<p>Recap Inquisitors cost $2000 and weight 10 lbs. Monthly maintenance requires
$100 in supplies and success in a <strong>Naturalist</strong> roll to keep the ‘shroom alive.</p>

<h2 id="additional-notes">Additional Notes</h2>

<p>I put in the same resistance mechanics for the two entries but I think they’re
mostly relevant for an interrogation scenario. When you step onto a recap patch
in the wild it’s probably funnier if they just succeed and narrate your last
week. It might even be fun to have the PC’s player do the narration if they’re
so inclined.</p>

<p>I say this because in my experience PCs rarely have something to hide from each
other, so there wouldn’t be really any dirty laundry that they didn’t want
aired. Of course, if you your group <em>is</em> a party of sneaky gits who do keep
important secrets from each other, then you should probably keep the resistance
test in place.</p>

    A silt horror devouring a group of adventurers.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, the only sea most Athasians know is the Sea of Silt. The
name here is pretty descriptive - an endless expanse of silvery dust that makes
up the eastern “border” of the Tyr Region. You can sail on it using special
vessels, and its depths conceal many ruins of extinct civilizations, as well as
an extensive ecosystem that’s a mystery to most surfacers.</p>

<p>Those who have more experience with the Sea of Silt might know of the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2025/06/10/wir-dscc-floating-mantle.html">Floating
Mantles</a> who sometimes wander into land, but the thing they fear the most is
the aptly named Silt Horror. These enormous beasts are more or less Darker and
Sunnier krakens, emerging from the deep to wrestle entire ships with their
grasping tentacles and devour them with their bottomless maws.</p>

<p>And that’s for the “basic” version that appears close to shore, the one with
white tentacles. Silt sailors who have ventured further away from shore come
back with stories about horrors with brown or gray tentacles who are even
larger - some of them larger than entire city-states. Are these tales true? Who
knows? It’s not like it’s easy to fact-check them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We only get the “basic” white-tentacled silt horror here. The bigger versions,
if they exist, are left as an exercise for the GM. Unlike a standard D&amp;D Kraken,
the silt horror is not sapient, but that doesn’t make it less dangerous.</p>

<p>The creature is so large that we get a stat block for the main body and a couple
of different stat blocks for its tentacles, which act like minions and
regenerate fast enough to keep coming back in the same fight after being
“slain”.</p>

<h3 id="silt-horror">Silt Horror</h3>

<p>The main body of the creature is a Huge Aberrant Beast and a Level 12 Solo
Lurker with 496 HP. It has a ground speed of 2 and a burrow speed of 6 on soft
earth, which is like a swim speed on the Sea of Silt. It’s Blind, and therefore
immune to the blinded conditions and to all gaze attacks. It perceives the world
via Termorsense 20.</p>

<p>The horror’s main trait covers its <strong>Regenerating Tentacles</strong>. Any time when the
horror has less than 4 tentacles within 20 squares of itself, a number of new
tentacles appear until it has 4. The horror chooses which types they are from
the three available (constricting, raking, sweeping). They appear above ground
even if the main body is burrowing, and act on their own initiative, rolled when
they appear.</p>

<p>The main body itself has a fairly basic <strong>Bite</strong> attack, but the star of the
show here is the <strong>Chomping Maw</strong> maneuver, which deals almost double the damage
and can target up to two creatures. The restriction here is that the main body
must be entirely underground to attack, and the targets must be grabbed by
tentacles.</p>

<p>As a move action, it can <strong>Submerge</strong>, burrowing its way to a space that’s
entirely underground. This recharges whenever it’s on the surface, so it’s more
or less at will. And when one of its tentacles is reduced to 0 HP with a melee
attack, it can make a free melee attack of its own before disappearing, dealing
10 extra damage and pushing the triggering PC 5 squares instead of grabbing
them.</p>

<h3 id="silt-horror-tentacles">Silt Horror Tentacles</h3>

<p>All three tentacle types are very similar to each other, so we’ll cover them
in the same entry.</p>

<p>First, the common traits: all three are Level 12 Minions. They have ground and
burrow speeds of 6, and act as sensory organs with the same Tremorsense 20 as
the main body. They’re obviously <strong>Attached</strong> to the silt horror and cannot be
more than 20 squares from the main body. They’re also <strong>Unhindered</strong>, which as
we know means they can pull any grabbed victims along with them when they move.</p>

<p>All three tentacles have a basic <strong>Seize</strong> attack, which deals physical damage
and grabs the victim. The stats that vary between the three types are their
creature roles, and what they can do with a grabbed victim using their second
attack.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Constricting</strong> tentacles are Soldiers and their <strong>Constricting Grab</strong>
damages and dazes the victim for a turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Raking</strong> tentacles are Skirmishers and their <strong>Sweeping Grab</strong> damages and
slides the victim 3 squares to a space adjacent to the tentacle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sweeping</strong> tentacles are Brutes and their <strong>Suffocating Grab</strong> damages and
knocks prone.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Even after the special attacks, the victims remain grabbed - use the standard
rules to try to get away.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Silt Horrors will most likely be found alone. They’re not sapient so they don’t
form alliances, and they’re impossible to tame. At most you might find them
already fighting another victim, such as a different ship, or a giant who was
wading through the Sea. These fellow targets might be friendly to the PCs, or
they might not.</p>

<p>Another possibility is an horror intruding upon an already ongoing fight against
those other ships or giants…</p>

<p>The mechanics here are very interesting. The tentacles want to grab as many
victims as possible and do nasty things to them while bringing them closer to
the main body’s location. The main body wants to stay underground until two
victims are in reach, use Chomping Maw on them, and then use Submerge to get
away again. As long as at least one PC remains grabbed, the horror could do this
every turn.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Silk Wyrms are snakelike monsters covered in chitinous carapaces. They’re gifted
with many natural weapons: bites laced with paralytic venom and the psionic
powers of flight, camouflage, and mesmerism.</p>

<p>Though incapable of communicating in humanoid languages they’re tenacious
endurance predators who employ clever hunting strategies.</p>

<p>Silk Wyrms will shadow their intended prey for days, looking for a time when its
guard is down. The book is not too specific about the nature of this prey. It
could be an adventuring party, a traveling caravan with humanoids and several
kinds of pack animal, or something like a pack of baazrags or other wild
animals. What matters is that the prey is easy to hunt and can be eaten “fresh”,
because silk wyrms apparently only eat their victims while they’re alive, and
abandon them when they die.</p>

<p>When their intended targets are vulnerable, the silk wyrm will sneak in,
paralyze a chosen victim, and devour them on the spot. If it manages to
incapacitate more than one victim it will drag one of them to its nest, where it
will trap them in silk strands and eat them over the course of the next few days
while they’re still alive.</p>

<p>Silk wyrms band together as hatchlings, but as soon as they reach the adult
stage their deeply antisocial instincts take over and they set off on their own
to become lone hunters. Only after many years do they become wise enough to
overcome this instinct and start allying with other creatures. Some manage to
lead bands of their own younger kin, while others can ally with those creatures
whose telepathy allows them to communicate with the wyrms and buy their service
with easy food.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Silk Wyrms are Natural Magical Beasts with the Reptile tag and Low-Light
Vision. All silk wyrms have a flight speed, but their flight is Clumsy, which
means they have a -4 penalty to attacks and defenses while on the air. This
means silk wyrms only fly to travel, but they prefer to fight on the ground.</p>

<p>We’ll look at their other traits in each stat block below.</p>

<h3 id="silk-wyrm-hatchling">Silk Wyrm Hatchling</h3>

<p>Too frail to set out on their own, hatchlings roam the wastes in bands,
spreading out to scout for prey and emitting a loud chirping noise when they
find it to call their clutch-mates. They’re Medium-sized Level 3 Minion
Skirmishers, with ground and flight speeds of 6.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Blood Scent</strong> trait means their attacks against bloodied creatures
ignore concealment. These will mostly be <strong>bites</strong> that deal poison damage and
slow for a turn. When the hatchling hits 0 HP, they release <strong>Silk Strands</strong> as
a last attack, which deal a bit of acid damage and restrain (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="silk-wyrm-adult">Silk Wyrm Adult</h3>

<p>In their “lone hunter” phase, adults are Large-sized Level 3 Solo Skirmishers
with 174 HP. Their flight speed increases to 8, but remains clumsy.</p>

<p>Adults retain <strong>Blood Scent</strong>, which works exactly the same way. They will
likely start the encounter in <strong>Shadow Form</strong> (minor, recharges when first
bloodied), which makes Insubstantial with Phasing and gives them +5 to Stealth
while stopping it from attacking. It can get out of this with a free action, and
will do so shortly after springing its ambush.</p>

<p>Once the wyrm appears in the middle of its targets, and again whenever the power
is charged, it will use <strong>Mesmerizing Dread</strong> (minor, recharge 4+), which deals
psychic damage to enemies in a Close Burst 5, slides them 3 squares, and
inflicts a -2 penalty to all defenses for a turn. Then it’s bite time.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bites</strong> deal more poison damage, since they’re not minions, and their
venom becomes stronger. The target is slowed (save ends), which worsens to
immobilized (save ends) on the first save and to helpless (save ends) on the
second failure. <strong>Wyrm Strike</strong> lets it bite two different targets with one
action.</p>

<p>Helpless is a funny and very worrying condition. It’s funny because going
strictly by the book, you can move and act normally while Helpless. However
you’re never <em>just</em> Helpless. The most common way to get this condition is to be
unconscious. In this case, even on a strict reading you’ll still be Restrained
when you fail your second save and become Helpless.</p>

<p>Being Helpless is worrying because it makes the victim grant combat advantage,
and opens them up to the Coup de Grace action, which is an attack with any
applicable power that auto-crits and kills the target outright if it deals more
than their bloodied value in damage.</p>

<p>If the Silk Wyrm manages to get someone immobilized, restrained, or helpless, it
will <strong>Feed</strong> on them, attacking their Fortitide eating one of their healing
surges, and healing 10 HP. There’s no damage other than this, apparently, which
makes this attack a lot more forgiving in a fight than it would otherwise seem.</p>

<p>It someone hits the adult wyrm with a melee or close attack, it can respond with
<strong>Silk Strands</strong> as a reaction. This is a melee 3 attack vs. Reflex, dealing
acid damage and restraining on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="silk-worm-elder">Silk Worm Elder</h3>

<p>Elders have lived long enough to learn the value of teamwork despite or perhaps
<em>because</em> of the loss of their ability to project silk strands in combat. They
band together with one another or with other powerful allies in order to survive
and keep eating. They’re Level 14 Skirmishers with 125 HP. Not being solos, they
don’t have a blanked +5 on all saves, but they still have that bonus on saves
against Immobilized or Slowed.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Form</strong> and <strong>Mesmerizing Dread</strong> work exactly the same, with Shadow
Form just making the wyrm Weakened instead of preventing attacks entirely. They
can only <strong>bite</strong> once per turn but their venom remains as potent as the
adult’s.</p>

<p>The problem here is the damage: both Mesmerizing Dread and the basic bite do
exactly the same damage as the adult’s, which is way, way below what it should
be for a level 14 monster.</p>

<p><strong>Feed</strong>, on the other hand, does a huge chunk of physical damage (5d10+6) in
addition to deleting a healing surge. It recharges when first bloodied instead
of being at-will, but it no longer has any target restictions. They still really
want to use this in a helpless target if they can, because it’s going to kill
any helpless target with 112 maximum HP or less.</p>

<p>Still, outside of their one or two uses of Feed, elders are significantly less
scary. The venom is still a concern, particularly if they have heavy hitters
with them, but barring errata it seems to me elders were made to rush in, use
Feed once or twice, and escape the fight using Shadow Form and <strong>Serpent
Strike</strong>, which they still have.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think the Lore section outlines possible silk wyrm encounters pretty well.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the first two seem okay to me, but the elder is weird. The damage
of their bites and Mesmerizing stare needs a buff. It’d make them more
consistently dangerous despite making their Feed attack a little less impressive
in comparison (as its 28 average damage is not a lot higher than the 22 their
bites would need).</p>
