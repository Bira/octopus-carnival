          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Continuing our read of the Hazards section, we’ll now see a few Wilderness
hazards. These are all naturally occurring, and most are extra-dangerous
versions of the terrain we saw earlier.</p>

<h2 id="wilderness-hazards">Wilderness Hazards</h2>

<h3 id="chokedust-cloud-level-2-lurker">Chokedust Cloud (Level 2 Lurker)</h3>

<p>A more dangerous version of the stuff you might find in ash wastes, silt pools,
and deserts with particularly fine sand. This is a 3-by-3 area of particularly
fine and powdery stuff, and the slightest disturbance will cause it to form a
cloud.</p>

<p>Characters can roll Perception to notice the area is different, and if they pass
that first test they can roll an easier Nature one to learn exactly why.</p>

<p>The hazard triggers when someone steps into the area, or when a portion of it is
included in a blast or burst attack. The entire area erupts into a choking cloud
that attacks the Fortitude of those standing on it. On a hit it blinds and
inflicts ongoing 5 damage (save ends). The cloud stays around after this -
victims cannot save against its effects while they remain inside. I imagine it
also attacks anyone who steps into it after this.</p>

<p>Characters can roll Acrobatics when moving into the area to avoid disturbing it,
and they can roll Endurance to steel themselves and gain a +2 to Fortitude
against the cloud’s next attack.</p>

<h3 id="badlands-tremor-level-5-lurker">Badlands Tremor (Level 5 Lurker)</h3>

<p>A small localized earthquake. It has four epicenter squares scattered through
the encounter area. The GM can either roll randomly or place them for maximum
inconvenience.</p>

<p>Characters can roll Perception to listen for the groaning noise that precedes
the tremor, and then Nature to identify it as an incoming earthquake and (with a
good enough roll) where the epicenters are.</p>

<p>The tremor starts when the encounter does - roll initiative for it. On its
initiative count, a random epicenter makes a Close Burst 5 attack vs. Reflex
that damages and knocks prone on a hit, half on a miss, and makes its area
difficult terrain.</p>

<p>The only countermeasure is an Acrobatics check on your turn to brace yourself
for the next tremor. Staying away from the tremor areas also works, but it might
not be feasible depending on the map’s layout.</p>

<h3 id="silt-sink-level-8-lurker">Silt Sink (Level 8 Lurker)</h3>

<p>A much more dangerous version of the Silt Pool terrain from before. This is a
4-by-4 squares wide, 30-foot deep hole filled with silt.</p>

<p>It takes a Perception roll to notice the ground is different, and then a Nature
check to realize this is a deep pit that could bury someone.</p>

<p>If someone steps onto the pit’s area, they suffer an attack against their
Reflex. On a hit they take fall damage (3d10, as if the pit was empty), and then
get immobilized and begin to take ongoing 5 damage until they escape.</p>

<p>An escape attempt requires a series of Athletics or Acrobatics check against the
pit’s escape DC. Each success causes the victm to rise 10 feet towards the
surface. If they’re still in the pit at the end of their turn, they remain
immobilized however. So it takes 3 successes for someone to fully escape.</p>

<p>Another character can try to help the victim if they can find a way to reach
them (such as with a long branch or pole), using a move action to automatically
pull them up by 10 feet.</p>

<h3 id="devil-dune-level-9-obstacle">Devil Dune (Level 9 Obstacle)</h3>

<p>A huge pile of loose sand that is currently being pushed by the winds and moving
at a surprisingly high speed. This could be a natural phenomenon, or it could be
the work of an angry spirit.</p>

<p>It can be automatically noticed, and there’s a Nature check to realize it’s
dangerous. The dune rolls Initiative, and on its turn it shifts 4 square towards
the nearest creature. When it enters a creature’s space, it can attack their
Reflex to try to engulf them. This damages, slows, inflicts ongoing 5 damage,
and obscures vision beyond 2 squares (save ends all). On a miss, it just slows
for a turn.</p>

<p>Someone who starts their turn entirely inside the dune takes an attack against
their Fortitude, which deals heavy damage and restrains. It takes an escape
roll, not a save, to get out of the sand.</p>

<p>The only countermeasure, other than staying the heck away, is the option to roll
Acrobatics as an interrupt before the dune attacks your Reflex. The result of
the roll becomes your new defense against that attack, even if it was lower than
your Reflex.</p>

<h3 id="false-oasis-level-13-elite-lurker">False Oasis (Level 13 Elite Lurker)</h3>

<p>This 6-by-6 square area looks like an oasis, but it’s actually an
illusion. Behind it is a 2-by-2 area filled with blood-sucking creeper plants,
which counts as blocking terrain. Sounds like just the kind of thing a group of
sand brides would set up.</p>

<p>An Insight check might let someone recognize the oasis as an illusion, but not
identify what it hides. A harder Arcana test can do both.</p>

<p>If someone gets to within 3 squares of the illusion’s borders, the hazard rolls
initiative. On its turn, the creepers reach out and try to pull the victim, an
attack against AC that deals no damage and pulls the target 2 squares. This can
target up to three creatures, so it not being an opportunity attack is actually
an advantage. There’s enough time for multiple victims to approach the sweet,
sweet illusion.</p>

<p>If a character starts their turn adjacent to the actual creeper squares, they’re
targetted by an opportunity action that attacks their Fortitude and, on a hit,
weakens and inflicts ongoing 10 necrotic damage (save ends). On a miss, it deals
5 necrotic damage.</p>

<p>If you can’t pierce the illusion or staying away is not an option, you can
destroy the false oasis with violence (105 HP, vulnerable 15 radiant).</p>

<h3 id="dust-funnel-level-15-blaster">Dust Funnel (Level 15 Blaster)</h3>

<p>A tornado, more or less.</p>

<p>Roll Initiative for the hazard when combat starts, and choose a square on the
battle map. On its first turn, the dust funnel manifests in a Close Burst 2
around that square, and takes up that much space.</p>

<p>A Perception or an easier Nature test can identify this spot as the forces build
up, before the funnel manifests.</p>

<p>On its turns, the funnel moves 1d10 squares and makes an attack against anyone
who happens to be in its area. On a hit, it damages, knocks prone, and
immobilizes its targets (save ends). Until the target passes a save, they get
dragged along with the funnel whenever it moves. Of course, targets who get
dragged along will suffer the attack again next turn, since they will be in
reach of it.</p>

<p>Imagine if this thing manages to grab <em>every other combatant</em>, monsters and PCs
alike. That’d be hilarious.</p>

<p>Characters can make a hard Nature check to figure out where the funnel will move
in its next turn, and if they can’t escape its path they can spend a standard
action to grab onto something and get +4 to all defenses against its next
attack.</p>

<h3 id="desert-glass-level-17-obstacle">Desert Glass (Level 17 Obstacle)</h3>

<p>We already saw what an even mix of sand and powdered glass can do. This is a
stretch of ground that’s mostly pure glass, in much bigger chunks. It’s super
slippery and cuts you to ribbons if you fall.</p>

<p>The hazard covers 20 contiguous squares, in any configuration the GM wants. All
of them are difficult terrain. If they’re not obvious, such as if there’s a
thin layer of sand over them, they can be identified with a Perception test.</p>

<p>Anyone who enters, starts their turn, or stands up from prone on one of these
squares takes an attack against Reflex that damages, knocks prone, and inflicts
ongoing 10 damage (save ends). It the target was already prone, they are dazed
for a turn instead.</p>

<p>If one or more squares of the glass are included in an area attack that has the
cold, thunder, or force keywords, the affected squares make a Close Burst 1
attack that deals the same amount of immediate and ongoing damage as the other
one, and then disappear. They got shattered and blew up.</p>

<h3 id="venomous-spines-level-21-blaster">Venomous Spines (Level 21 Blaster)</h3>

<p>These are from a species of tree that grows on some of the rare jungle biomes of
Athas. When someone gets near, the tree forcibly ejects an omni-directional
cloud of venomous spines.</p>

<p>A Perception check can notice there’s something funny about that tree. A Nature
check can identify it before the PCs enter its range.</p>

<p>The attack hits a Close Burst 5 around the tree, dealing heavy poison damage and
making a secondary attack that on a hit blinds and inflicts ongoing 5 poison
damage (save ends). On a miss, it deals half damage.</p>

<p>Someone who knows the tree is dangerous can close in without triggering it with
an Acrobatics or Stealth check. They can then use hard Nature checks to reduce
the size of the burst by 2 per successful check, entirely “disarming” the tree
with the third success. I’m guessing they’re plucking the spines.</p>

<h3 id="defiled-plain-level-24-obstacle">Defiled Plain (Level 24 Obstacle)</h3>

<p>A patch of ground so thoroughly defiled it’s not just dead, it’s
“undead”. Anyone stepping on it will have their life force drained.</p>

<p>A Perception check can tell the ground is unnatural, and an Arcana check can
identify its danger.</p>

<p>The attack deals heavy necrotic damage and inflicts vulnerable 10 to all damage
(save ends). The first failed save causes the target to lose a healing surge,
and the second one makes the vulnerability <em>permanent</em> until cured by a ritual
like Remove Affliction. A miss deals half damage.</p>

<p>A character near or on the affected area can make a hard Arcana check to
neutralize it for a turn. Characters without Arcane Defiling powers or abilities
have a +2 on this test. Those who have these take a -2 instead. A preserver
(which I assume means someone without those abilities) can choose to spend 2
healing surges to destroy the hazard, which I guess means they can restore some
of the place’s lost life. The book says those healing surges can only be
regained through an extended rest, which feels redundant but I guess means no
other trick that would normally allow an early recovery can do so.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These hazards are generally scarier versions of the terrain we saw earlier, so
they’re certainly appropriate for inclusion in battles taking place in that
terrain.</p>

<p>And that’s it for the book! I hope you enjoyed the reading. I’m trying to think
of what to do next, so any suggestions are welcome.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As I mentioned in a <a href="/octopus-carnival/2025/12/22/lphr-background-change.html">post back in December</a>, I’ve been actually playing this
solo game in a sporadic fashion for years. And as I said back when I started, I
planned to post it here. So why didn’t I?</p>

<p>Basically, it was anxiety over art.</p>

<p>The first thing I was going to do was to post the stats for my player
characters, and since these were going to be “proper blog posts”, I decided I
wanted to have illustrations for them just like I have for all the other
characters I posted before.</p>

<p>My method of procuring them was going to be the same. I’d use search indexes and
trawl some specific art sites for published images I could add to the post, with
proper credit and a link to the original.</p>

<p>For certain characters, that’s dead easy. But for a couple of others I ended up
never finding an image that <em>exactly</em> matched what I wanted. Or when I did find
one that had the right vibe, it turned out the artist explicitly forbade this
kind of usage, even with proper credit. Also one of my sources was Pinterest and
I had just learned that one site had a serious “proper credit” issue. Whoops!
What to do?</p>

<p>I know exactly what suggestion is already forming in a lot of your brains right
now, and I’m gonna stop y’all right there and say “no”. I’m not using AI for
this, or anything else. Not now, not ever.</p>

<p>So after way too long you’ll get those posts without illustrations at all. I
can’t draw, but I can write, so you’re getting verbal descriptions. And maybe
then I can finally proceed with publishing this.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Even if the stuff we saw on our previous post was pretty hazardous, none of it
counts as a “hazard” in mechanical terms.</p>

<p>The main difference is that Terrain is entirely passive. It might do something
when you step on it, or it might allow a character to perform some special
action when next to it, but it never <em>initiates</em> any interaction.</p>

<p>Hazards, on the other hand, have enough “agency” to count as a monster for
encounter building purposes. They can make attacks, and can also be disabled by
the methods outlined in its description. Traps are the most popular example of
hazards, but these rules can also model dangerous terrain features that weren’t
built to do harm on purpose. Obviously, unlike real monsters, traps and hazards
don’t use tactics. They just follow their “programming”.</p>

<p>Traps and hazards have their own set of roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blasters</strong> make ranged or area attacks. A crossbow trap is the most popular
example.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lurkers</strong> can disappear for a while after making their attacks, so dealing
with them is harder. A blade trap that retracts into the wall is a good
example.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Obstacles</strong> impede movement, both by their presence and with attacks that
slow the target down. They might block passage entirely or require characters
to make tricky movement or puzzle-solving skill checks to pass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Warders</strong> are alarm systems. They can have damaging attacks too, and will
make them as soon as they detect intruders, but their main function is to warn
others about the presence of those intruders. The alarm might only sound once,
or keep sounding while the hazard persists. In truth, this seems to be kind of
a catch-all category. If the hazard can’t conceal itself after attacking and
doesn’t really impede movement, it’s a warder. A shrieker mushroom is a
non-damaging example.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the summarized descriptions below, I always start with a description of the
hazard’s nature and appearance, what it does when triggered, and how to avoid or
disable it.</p>

<h2 id="arena-hazards">Arena Hazards</h2>

<p>This subsection details hazards that might be found in the many gladiatorial
arenas of Athas. They’re placed on purpose to make things more “interesting”,
but they’re not really <em>traps</em> per se.</p>

<h3 id="worthy-sacrifices-of-draj">Worthy Sacrifices of Draj</h3>

<p>This is a 3-by-6 square pile or corpses with their hearts torn out. <em>Animated</em>
corpses, that will try to grab, pull, and gnaw on anyone they sense nearby. It’s
a Level 8 Obstacle.</p>

<p>PCs can notice the corpses are animated with Perception or Religion. The pile
makes opportunity attacks that damage and grab against any character who steps
adjacent to it. Roll Initiative for it after the first such attack. On its
turn, it will try to pull any grabbed victims into itself, dealing the same
damage as the initial attack and inflicting ongoing 10 necrotic damage while the
victims remain inside.</p>

<p>A PC can choose to make an Acrobatics test when they step adjacent to the pile
to avoid the opportunity attack. They can disable it either by good old
fashioned violence (70 HP, resist necrotic, vulnerable radiant), or by
improvising an exorcism with Nature and Religion. This is a complexiy 1 skill
challenge where each failure deals 5 necrotic damage to the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="blood-trees-of-gulg">Blood Trees of Gulg</h3>

<p>These are large trees with red leaves. The main arena in Gulg has about a dozen
of these planted in a semi-random arrangement. Their trunks completely fill a
square and count as blocking terrain. Their branches stretch 3 squares in every
direction from the trunk.</p>

<p>The rumor that these trees have red leaves because they feed on blood is
false. The leaves are naturally red, and the trees are mostly harmless. They
only turn carnivorous when they’re about to bloom, you see.</p>

<p>There’s no fixed blooming season - the timing for that is rather random. For
this specific arena, at most 3 trees might be dangerous at a time. The rest are
still blocking terrain, of course.</p>

<p>Blood Trees are level 9 Warders. Their presence is obvious, and a Nature or
Perception check can allow a PC to notice that a given tree is “primed” and what
its reach is (it’s 3).</p>

<p>When someone steps into that reach, the tree makes an opportunity attack that
damages and knocks prone on a hit. On its turn, it apparently uses another set
of branches to make attacks against Fortitude to damage, poison and fling away
anyone it hits with those. That’s ongoing 5 poison (save ends), plus a secondary
attack that makes a 5-square push on a hit.</p>

<p>Blood trees can be destroyed by violence (100 HP, resist 10 poison); and a PC
can succeed at a Nature check when stepping into their reach to avoid the
opportunity attack and be ignored by the tree for the rest of the encounter.</p>

<h3 id="obsidian-façades-of-urik">Obsidian Façades of Urik</h3>

<p>The arena in Urik is a former pit from an obsidian mine. Its walls are wickedly
sharp and good enough at absorbing heat that by noon the arena resembles a huge
natural air fryer. Guess when fights take place.</p>

<p>Characters inside the arena are exposed to Sun Sickness, a disease detailed in
the Dark Sun Campaign Setting that probably represents heat stroke and
dehydration. The walls are a variable level Obstacle, and moving adjacent to
them subjects the character to an attack that deals mixed physical and fire
damage that rises with tier. Characters doing so on purpose can attempt an
Acrobatics check to avoid this.</p>

<h2 id="next-up">Next up</h2>

<p>Wilderness hazards! Because the world itself is also out to get you.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>We’re done with monsters for now, and we’re getting into a section about
terrain.</p>

<p>Terrain is as important a building block for a fun encounters as the monsters
that make it up, and this section has some uniquely Dark and Sunny examples for
you to add to your battlemaps.</p>

<h2 id="barbed-cacti">Barbed Cacti</h2>

<p>Even when they don’t uproot themselves to hunt you down, Athasian cacti can
still be dangerous. These specimens have sharp spines that break off and stay
stuck to you. Lines of barbed cactus squares can be used to cordon off some
areas of the battlefield, and provide an excellent barrier for artillery
monsters to hide behind.</p>

<p>Entering a square of barbed cacti deals 3 damage and inflices -2 to attack rolls
(save ends).</p>

<h2 id="brambleweed">Brambleweed</h2>

<p>Like barbed cacti, but worse. Brambleweed grows in sprawling thickets that can
thrive even in defiled areas, because they can use the blood or corpses of
captured creatures as nourishment. Some defilers plant them intentionally as
defensive measures in their lairs.</p>

<p>A creature that ends their turn in a brambleweed square is restrained until the
end of their next turn. A creature that <em>starts</em> their turn there (which they
will if they were restrained) takes 5/tier damage.</p>

<h2 id="defiled-terrain">Defiled Terrain</h2>

<p>This is a more varied category describing several possibilities for what might
remain behind after a major act of defiling. It can be used as pre-existing
terrain in an area what was subject to defiling in the past, or you can place it
in the middle of the fight after someone uses Arcane Defiling or an equivalent
power.</p>

<h3 id="ash-field">Ash Field</h3>

<p>These are the remains of plant life caught in a defiling field. Sometimes the
wind causes them to pool in terrain depressions to form areas of Settled Ash,
which can act as a terrain feature.</p>

<p>Someone who’s adjacent to a square of settled ash can make an Athletics test to
raise a cloud of it, which functions as a blast attack vs. Fortitude that blinds
for a turn on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="black-sand">Black Sand</h3>

<p>The residue of defiling mixed in with the local soil. People standing on black
sand only regain half the normal amount of HP from healing effects. Wasn’t there
an entire geographical region covered in the stuff?</p>

<h3 id="dead-magic">Dead Magic</h3>

<p>Areas that have lost so much to defiling that they have nothing left to
give. Anyone standing on dead magic squares takes a -5 penalty to attack with
arcane or primal powers, and is barred from using Arcane Defiling.</p>

<p>The book recommends being careful with dead magic areas, particularly if there
are a lot of arcane and primal PCs in the party. Usually only very powerful
defilers are capable of creating them.</p>

<h3 id="sickening-heat">Sickening Heat</h3>

<p>This is either a mystical side effect of defiling, or it could just be a natural
consequence of killing all that plant cover. Creatures ending their turn on
these squares are weakened for a turn.</p>

<p>This terrain can do a number on your party’s strikers, and monsters who have the
ability to inflict forced movement simply love it.</p>

<h2 id="glimmering-mirage">Glimmering Mirage</h2>

<p>Mundane mirages are the effect of heat haze in the distance. These ones are more
than that: they’re illusions crafted by malicious primal spirits. In addition to
luring travelers, they persist once they get closer, and can conceal all kinds
of danger behinds their alluring façades.</p>

<p>Glimmering mirages form walls 4 or more squares long. They block line of sight,
and give concealment against ranged attacks to anyone standing adjacent to
them. At the end of every turn, you roll a d6 for each mirage. A 1 means it’s
gone, a 6 means it moves 5 squares, and other results mean it stays put.</p>

<h2 id="lightning-pillar">Lightning Pillar</h2>

<p>Literally a pillar of congealed lightning, probably created due to the area’s
proximity to an “electric” region of the Elemental Chaos. PCs and enemies might
be able to use their Arcana, Nature, or Religion skills to “hack” such a pillar
and make it deliver a lightning strike to a chosen target.</p>

<h2 id="mudflats">Mudflats</h2>

<p>These are natural areas where underground water surfaces a bit and mixes with
the soil, creating an area that is both dusty and sludgy at the same
time. Inland mudflats are the next best thing to oases, and draw many animals
and people who learn to extract water from them.</p>

<p>Particularly thick mud flats are difficult terrain, and can contain <strong>mud sink</strong>
squares representing deeper areas. Creatures standing adjacent to those can be
pushed into them, which will immobilize them (save ends), with a slow
after-effect due to the clinging mud (also save ends). Voluntarily or
accidentally stepping into one would have the same effect.</p>

<h2 id="psychic-reservoirs">Psychic Reservoirs</h2>

<p>Fragile purple crystals that grow in psychically charged areas sheltered from
the winds, these can be tapped by psionic characters to boost their attacks. It
takes a minor action to tap into an adjacent crystal, which makes it crumble to
dust. If the character uses power points, they gain 1 bonus point that lasts
until the end of the encounter. Otherwise they gain +5 to their next damage roll
from a psionic power.</p>

<h2 id="rocky-badlands">Rocky Badlands</h2>

<p>These regions are too rough to support permanent settlements, so they’ll mostly
feature as ambush sites. They’re filled with <strong>teetering stone pillars</strong> that
can be pushed onto enemies.</p>

<h2 id="salt-flats">Salt Flats</h2>

<p>These bone-dry regions are a hassle to fight in, as salt will inevitably get in
the wounds and make them sting like hell. They’re also filled with loose <strong>salt
piles</strong> that work a lot like the Settled Ash hazard above, except that they also
slow the target if it was bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="sandy-wastes">Sandy Wastes</h2>

<p>What most people think of when they hear “desert”. They can contain 3x3-square
<strong>Small Dunes</strong> that anyone might use as a hiding or ambush spot, even if they
can’t normally burrow.</p>

<h2 id="silt-pools">Silt Pools</h2>

<p>They work a lot like mud flats, except there’s no water, just very fine
dust. Usually filled with difficult terrain, and with <strong>deep silt spots</strong> that
restrain (save ends) anyone who falls or gets pushed into them.</p>

<h2 id="slipsand">Slipsand</h2>

<p>Sandy areas where some magical or psionic effect caused a significant amount of
tiny glass crystals to be mixed in with the sand. They’re slippery <em>and</em> sharp,
requiring an Athletics check from any who enters them to avoid falling prone and
taking damage.</p>

<h2 id="tree-of-life">Tree of Life</h2>

<p>These extremely rare plants are imbued with a much greater than usual amount of
vital energy, which enables them to resist and even recover from defiling
attempts given enough time. Ironically, this makes them extremely valued by
sorcerer-kings and other powerful and rich defilers, which cultivate them for
use as batteries.</p>

<p>I think earlier editions kept a more or less precise list of the remaining trees
of life in Athas - they were <em>that</em> rare. In this edition, I believe their
number is less restricted, but the most likely place you’re going to find one is
still in the “boss room” for these defilers.</p>

<p>Trees of life emit a 5-square aura. Creatures within always regain the maximum
possible HP from variable healing effects, and have a +5 to perform divination
rituals.</p>

<p>Whenever someone performs Arcane Defiling inside the aura, or use some other
necrotic power that damages one of their allies, the tree takes the damage
instead. Trees have 500 HP and Vulnerable 10 Necrotic, and die when they
hit 0. They regenerate 5 HP per hour.</p>

<h2 id="ztal-horde">Z’Tal Horde</h2>

<p>A much funnier and more mundane piece of terrain! Z’tals are tiny, slimy, stinky
lizard-bug-things that gather in very large swarms. They’re relatively harmless,
but still a bother.</p>

<p>A z’tall horde fills one or more squares, which are difficult terrain. Someone
who ends their movement in such a square takes 5/tier poison damage from the
stink. Someone who starts their turn in a horde square must roll a save before
taking any other actions. A failure means they fall prone because of the
slippery slime. A close or area attack that deals at least 1 point of damage
will automatically disperse a horde square with no roll required.</p>

<p>They’re sometimes bred as living security measures, but a horde of these
annoying scavengers might naturally form around the corpse of any large
creature.</p>
