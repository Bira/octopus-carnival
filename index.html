            <p>As we all know by now, psychic powers are very common in Athas. Anyone might
have some, even if that’s not their main specialty. For PCs, this is implemented
as a couple of character themes (Noble Adept and Wilder).</p>

<p>For NPCs and monsters, we have the Psionic Adept theme presented here. You can
add this to a non-psionic monster to make it more controller-ish.</p>

<p>Psionic Adepts gain a +2 to either either Diplomacy and Intimidate (force of
personality!) or to Insight and Perception (sixth sense!).</p>

<h2 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h2>

<p>Following the usual design strategy of adding new abilities that work “around”
established attacks, we get a collection of powers that hinder and debuff
enemies. All of the ones that require attack rolls target Will.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blind the Mind’s Eye</strong> (recharge 5+) is a ranged attack that makes the
creature invisible to the target (save ends). This ends when the creature
attacks the target. Lurkers can use this to enable their big attacks, while
others can use it as a way to ease pressure on themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Empathic Wall</strong> (recharge 6+) creates a 12-square wall that lasts a turn. It
blocks line of sight. People can cross it, but its squares are difficult
terrain, and anyone inside them is lightly obscured.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mantle of the Mind</strong> (encounter) is a close burst 4 that attacks will and
prevents affected targets from targeting the creature with their attacks (save
ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mental Marionette</strong> (encounter) is a sustainable domination power. It
dominates for a turn on a hit, but can be sustained with standard actions to
let the creature repeat the attack against the same target, potentially
prolonging the domination. On a miss, it dazes for a turn. It’s a little
weaker than a fire-and-forget (save ends) power, because it eats up standard
actions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three variants of <strong>Psionic Augmentation</strong> that add a little extra something
when the creature hits with a melee basic attack. One deals extra psychic
damage, the other dazes for a turn, and the third one inflicts ongoing psychic
damage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>These are a lot more clearly “utilities” than the ones for elemental
creatures. They’re all encounter powers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mental Bastion</strong> is an interrupt that gives a +4 to Will, potentially
turning a hit into a miss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Open the Mind’s Eye</strong> gives blindsight 5 and all-around vision for a
turn. The latter means the creature cannot be flanked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Oracular Empathy</strong> is a weird one. When an nearby ally of the creature is
hit by an attack, the creature can use a reaction to switch its initiative
order to be just after the attacker’s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Psionic Flight</strong> automatically pushes each adjacent enemy 1 square and lets
the creature fly its speed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Pretty cool! It seems more thematically tight to me than Elementally
Infused. Adding these powers to someone like an ogre would be a nice/nasty
surprise.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Athas is a world particularly close to the Elemental Chaos, and so there are
lots of places in it that are soaked in elemental energies of some kind. The
creatures that inhabit these areas often end up elementally-infused.</p>

<p>The book suggests changing the creature’s origin to elemental if its mutations
end up being inheritable, though that just affects the lore and so it’s just
necessary if it will affect the game’s stories in some way.</p>

<p>The main mechanical thing you must decided about an elementally-infused creature
is its element. All of its powers that deal damage have it written as “[damage
type]” in the book, and you’re meant to replace that lacuna with a type
corresponding to the creature’s associated elements: one of fire, acid, cold,
thunder, or lightning (very very frightening!).</p>

<p>Not all of its attacks need to do the same type of damage. Multi-element
elementals are a thing now, after all. And you might decide to make one or more
of these attacks untyped, which would be common for an earth elemental whose
rock-based attacks deal physical damage for example.</p>

<p>Elementally-infused creatures get +2 to Intimidate and Athletics.</p>

<h2 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h2>

<p>All of these powers deal damage of the type you chose above.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are two <strong>Elemental Auras</strong>, one that triggers when the monster is
bloodied and damages enemies inside, and one that is always active and makes
enemies vulnerable to your chosen element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Eruption</strong> causes an explosion when the monster is first bloodied,
a close burst 2 that targets Reflex and deals elemental damage equal to the
monster’s best basic attack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Manifestation</strong> converts the damage of all of the monster’s
attacks to your chosen element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Persistence</strong> is recharge 5+ and inflicts 5/tier ongoing damage of
the chosen type when the monster hits with a melee attack. It’s said to
increase “damage output and entertainment value”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>The most obvious here is <strong>Elemental Damage Resistance</strong>, which should be high
enough for the monster to resist its own attacks (or I guess 5/tier if you don’t
want to do math). If a monster’s attacks are untyped, you could give it
variable resistance instead.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the others deal damage, proving that the “attack”/”utility” split
is more of a guideline here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Dissipation</strong> lets the monster vanish from play for a turn and
reform next to an enemy, dealing a bit of damage and making them grant combat
advantage for another turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Ground</strong> is a third aura variant, this time meant to keep enemies
close. The aura’s radius becomes difficult terrain and enemies take damage
when they leave it, instead of when they enter it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Step</strong> deals elemental damage to anyone who hits the monster with
an opportunity attack while it moves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Transport</strong> lets the monster teleport between patches of hazardous
terrain that deal damage of the chosen type. Clever!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mutable Body</strong> is appropriate for water-based or otherwise gooey monsters,
and lets the creature count as one size smaller when squeezing through narrow
openings.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>You want elemental damage? We got elemental damage! I like the design strategy
of additional attack powers that modify and work around the monster’s usual
attacks, and it works particularly well here.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>We’re past the monster lists, but there’s still a fair amount of book to
cover. Its final third is dedicated to Encounter Options, and the first
subsection of that is a small lesson on Customizing Monsters.</p>

<p>The gist of it is that when you want to bring a “generic” D&amp;D monster to Athas,
you should change them a little to make them fit the more brutal and desperate
tone of the setting. In other words, you should make them Darker and Sunnier.</p>

<p>The next page has a few tips on how to do that. First, you should keep the
monster recognizable, since it both keeps things a little familiar and makes
the differences stand out that much more. And then you can apply one or more of
the customization guidelines they suggest, each with an example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No change</strong>: Some monsters already fit the aesthetic and could just be
dropped in where you need them. Gnolls and bullettes, for example.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Altered Appearance</strong>: Some monsters need a little extra make-up to fit the
visual style of Athas. You’ll rarely find traditional mammals here for
example, but you could have equivalent creatures that have carapaces, scales,
and bony plates instead of soft fur. Hill giants might look more rocky, with
skin matching the colors of the surrounding terrain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Altered Environment</strong>: Creatures that live in frozen or aquatic biomes in
their original forms could be changed to live in the desert wastelands of
Athas instead. Sure, the aquatic ones could live in oases, but turning them
into sand-burrowers can be a “nice” surprise for the players.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Alternative Lore</strong>: This most important for creatures whose lore has
extensive ties to the Astral Sea and divine magic, both of which are mostly
inaccessible in Athas. Eidolons are one example, and they’d need to be changed
to be tied to arcane or primal magic instead unless they’re relics from when
the gods were still around. Angels and the like should also be reskinned
unless your entire game revolves around the mystery of why they appeared.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New Powers</strong>: New mechanical abilities might be just the thing to make a
given creature Darker and Sunnier. This should mostly be handled through
Monster Themes, which are discussed in the next page.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sample-converted-monsters">Sample Converted Monsters</h2>

<p>These two are given as examples, and in some cases are also stealth updates to
the originals, using the new Monster Manual 3 math.</p>

<h3 id="silt-shark">Silt Shark</h3>

<p>Based on the Fleshtearer Shark from the Monster Manual 2, this creature occupies
a similar niche to the bullette, with slightly different abilities. Its
water-based traits were replaced with sand-themed equivalents, and it’s been
given training in Athletics to make higher jumps. It “swims” through sand and
loose soil.</p>

<p>The Silt Shark is a Large Natural Beast and a Level 10 Brute with 128 HP. It has
a ground speed of 5, and a burrow speed of 8, with low-light vision and
Tremorsense 10.</p>

<p>The original shark’s Aquatic trait has been replaced with <strong>Silt Swimmer</strong>,
which lets the shark shift and charge while burrowing, and gives it a +2 damage
bonus while burrowing against any creature without a burrow speed. It cannot
burrow through solid stone, however.</p>

<p>The shark has a basic <strong>Bite</strong>, and a <strong>Lockjaw Charge</strong> maneuver that deals the
same damage and grabs on a hit. While the shark has a grabbed victim, it can
automatically deal damage to them with <strong>Shredding Teeth</strong>. And once the grab
ends, the victim takes ongoing 5 damage (save ends).</p>

<p>If the shark starts its turn within 5 squares of a bloodied creature, it enters
a <strong>Feeding Frenzy</strong>, and makes a free attack against a creature adjacent to
it. If it was grabbing someone, it releases them first.</p>

<h3 id="ssurran-dune-mystic">Ssurran Dune Mystic</h3>

<p>This is a Greenscale Marsh Mystic from the Monster Manual, modified into a
Ssurran version. The swamp theme of the original’s abilities has been switched
to a sand and desert theme, its Constitution was increased a little, and its
basic attack has been given a push rider to match the Ssurran Shaman from that
entry.</p>

<p>We end up with a Level 6 Controller (Leader) with 72 HP and a ground speed of 6
with Earth Walk. It has a <strong>Sun Blessing</strong> aura (5) that heals 3 HP to any ally
that stats their turn inside, and fights with a <strong>spear</strong> that damages and
pushes 2 squares on a hit.</p>

<p>The mystic also has a couple of fireball-style combat spells: <strong>Salt Cloud</strong>
(recharge 5+) deals poison damage and dazes for a turn; <strong>Sand’s Grasp</strong>
(encounter) is non-damaging, but it immobilizes (save ends) and creates a zone
of difficult terrain that lasts for the rest of the encounter.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>It’s quite likely that anyone who still actively plays D&amp;D 4th Edition is
experienced enough at reskinning monsters that they don’t really need this
advice. Nevertheless, it’s still good to see it printed, and with worked
examples to boot.</p>

  Zeburon

</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Zeburon is the leader of the Black Sands Raiders, a brutal and feared bandit
gang that hides out in the Black Sands. According to rumor they always number a
hundred, and ride war-trained kanks to assault caravans and settlements around
the Black Sands.</p>

<p>The Iron Rider got this title because of his signature metal helmet, which has a
pair of prominent horns and completely conceals his face. Not even most of the
Raiders have ever seen it - only his most trusted lieutenants (such as the
defiler Fevik) know what he looks like.</p>

<p>And this is because Zeburon’s big secret is that he’s a tiefling. The book lists
reasons why no one has figured it out yet, and they’re actually a little
funny. He lacks a tail because he cut it off himself years ago. People tend to
mistake the reddish tone of his skin for sunburns instead of natural
pigmentation. And they think the horns are part of the helmet, when in fact
they’re poking through a pair of holes in it.</p>

<p>Zeburon hides his true nature from the rank and file of his gang because he’s
afraid of how they’d react if they found out. Given bigotry is never in short
supply around Athas, I’m guessing the answer is “not well”. And being a fearsome
individual warrior is not very helpful if about ninety guys on war kanks decide
they want you dead and charge you all at once.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Zeburon is a Level 12 Elite Soldier with 246 HP. He has a ground speed of 6,
low-light vision, and Resist Fire 10.</p>

<p>All of his attacks deal bonus damage against bloodied targets due to his
<strong>Bloody Violence</strong> trait. He fights with a <strong>Bastard Sword</strong> that can make
standard basic attacks and be used in a <strong>Wild Bloodletting</strong> maneuver,
attacking a Close Burst 1. A hit deals damage, slows the target, and inflicts
ongoing 10 damage (save ends both). This recharges when he’s first bloodied.</p>

<p>As a minor action he can use his <strong>Iron Fist</strong> (metal gauntlet!) to make another
attack, which does the same damage as the sword, and immobilizes for a turn.</p>

<p>Finally, he has the tiefling <strong>Infernal Wrath</strong> power which, when used, gives
him a bonus to attacks and damage against any enemy that hit him since the end
of his last turn. This lasts for a turn or until he hits an enemy.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>A fight against Zeburon will also include a sizable contingent of Black Sands
Raiders, as well as his best buddy and top lieutenant Fevik the Defiler. Plus
any amount of kank mounts you deem necessary. It will likely come after the PCs
have fought multiple encounters against the raiders, too.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure I’ve seen someone a lot like Zeburon in one of the many Brom
illustrations for DS: muscles, leather straps, face-concealing horned helmet,
menacing pose.  I haven’t read any older DS material to know whether he’s
someone from the old days, or if he’s new and just likes following local
fashions.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>“Wait,” you might ask, “are you still doing this?”. Yes, I am! I have been doing
it since shortly after the last time I talked about it, off and on, but I
haven’t posted anything else here in the blog for entirely personal reasons that
I should overcome any day now.</p>

<p>And we’re going to start with a little correction here, because over the course
of my play, I’ve looked at the timelines a bit closer and the details for the
Knight of the Deep <a href="/octopus-carnival/2024/08/30/lphr-player-characters.htlm">origin</a> don’t make sense as written.</p>

<p>The PC arrives at Kintargo at the start of Adventure 01, which is supposed to
last at least eight weeks or so given the pace at which the “strategic”
rebellion turns move.</p>

<p>However, the aquatic elves that origin is concerned with rescuing are only
captured in the final stretch of Adventure 02. Here’s the timeline as written in
the adventure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The elves arrive in town maybe a week or two before the day of their
capture. This would be in the middle of Adventure 02.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are seeking Shensen’s help with their problems back home. When they fail
to find her, they spend some time exploring the waters around Kintargo before
being captured by the aboleth’s minions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The day of their capture is “fuzzy” - it’s the day before the PCs first enter
the adventure’s final dungeon. Once they do, the GM is supposed to track their
condition over time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The elves might starve before being rescued, and if they’re still alive after
two weeks they’re taken back home to be dominated by the aboleth.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we take the Knight’s current background as written, it would mean the elves
have been captured <em>before Adventure 01</em>. If we want the PC to have any chance
at all to rescue the elven scouts, we either have to make the Lucky Bones delve
the <em>very first thing</em> the PCs do after the riot, or we have to change the
background.</p>

<p>Doing the former is actually no trouble in Dungeon Fantasy. Starting delvers are
already strong enough to tackle the place, you just might need to put some magic
weapons within easy reach in the first level. If that’s what you want, just have
Laria Longroad point them to the place directly instead of the Wasp Nest.</p>

<p>Since I have already played through the Wasp Nest storyline on my own and I
don’t want to restart the game all the way from the beginning, though, I’m going
to change the background.</p>

<p>Instead of being sent to rescue the scouts, the Knight will be sent in to seek
Shensen’s aid. This gives them a stronger reason to stick with the rebellion,
and a better clue of which path to follow in pursuit of their goals.</p>

<p>The scouts still go to Kintargo in Adventure 02, but this time they do so to
find the Knight, who has been taking much longer than anticipated to return with
Shensen.</p>

<p>Rules-wise, the only thing that changes is that the optional Obsession to find
Aava becomes an Obsession to find Shensen, worth the same number of points.</p>

<p>I’ve also changed the description of the theme in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2024/08/30/lphr-player-characters.htlm">original post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pc-origin-knight-of-the-deep">PC Origin: Knight of the Deep</h2>

<p>You come from one of the subaquatic communities off the coast of Ravounel, where
you enjoy an heroic reputation. You recently went to visit your friend Aava in
the coastal village of Acisazi, only to find the village suffering under a
strange malaise. The village’s elder told you this was caused by a curse that
was beyond her power to break, and begged you to seek the aid of Shensen, a
powerful bard and priest of Sarenrae who lived in the city of Kintargo. You
accepted.</p>

<p>You arrive at this land-lubber town to find it embroiled in a lot more trouble
than you thought possible. Shensen is nowhere to be found. You suspect she
vanished into the prisons of the despotic Barzilai Thrune, and your queries have
led you to the Aria Park protest. You suspect you might need to bloody this
human despot’s nose to fulfill your mission, and that’s just fine with you.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: You must belong to a species capable of breathing underwater!
Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level contains two possible choices here: the Sea
Elf and the Water-Infused. From this blog, you might also pick the [Argonian][2]
or perhaps a <a href="/octopus-carnival/2024/08/30/lphr-player-characters.htlm">Warforged</a> who has been modified to be hydrodynamic and
Amphibious. And of course we also have a whole article about the [Denizens of
the Sea][5] that also contains a few usable ancestries.</p>

<p>This theme is open to any profession, but martial types should probably keep in
mind the rules for [underwater combat for fish-people][3].</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: The people of Acisazi know and trust you, and Aava is your good
friend (or even a relative if you’re also a sea elf).</p>

<p>You can add Swimming, Aquabatics and Survival (Undersea) to your template as
optional skills, and should probably put some points in them during character
creation.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Add Obsession (find Shensen) (12) {-5} to your template as an
optional disadvantage. It’s what you already want to do anyway, but like the
Last Archivist’s Obsession it might drive you to unwise actions.</p>
