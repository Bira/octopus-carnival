<p>Hell’s Rebels includes some traits in its Player’s Guide that can be assigned to
PCs to tie them to the campaign either by providing a motivation or by giving
them additional ways to contribute. A PC could be a minor worker in the opera,
or a fed-up citizen, or interested in the city’s history, and so on.</p>

<p>I don’t think those quite fit what I have in mind for my solo campaign. They are
suitable as backgrounds for level 1 starting characters and their mechanics can
be useful at the start, but pretty much cease to be a factor in the story once
the “main plot” kicks in.</p>

<p>Despite being released six years earlier than Hell’s Rebels, the <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/neverwinter/">Neverwinter
Campaign Setting</a> for D&amp;D 4e does a much better job at allowing players to
create characters who are <em>deeply</em> involved with the campaign at hand. More than
starting motivations, its character themes provide entire story arcs that will
remain relevant throughout the entire campaign.</p>

<p>I want the same thing for my game, so I’m going to replace the relatively
generic reasons given in the Hell’s Rebels player guide with something that’s
narratively on par with Neverwinter’s themes. I want them to not only be more
exciting, but also to reflect the increased starting power of Dungeon Fantasy
characters. They’re going to be key players in the rebellion from minute one of
the campaign. Why just be a random history buff when you can be The Last
Archivist instead? This status might be reflected in some of their traits, but
the story consequences are the main thing here.</p>

<p>Here are the “character themes” I intend to use. There are five, one for each of
my intended PCs, but presenting them separately will help provide some
inspiration to other GMs who want to do the same thing whether in GURPS or
another system. I’m using Dungeon Fantasy archetype and ancestry names instead
of those from Pathfinder, but the correlations should be pretty easy to
deduce. Each of them also has plot ties to some of the game’s possible allied
factions.</p>

<p>Each theme bellow includes a short background description, and paragraphs
listing prerequisites, benefits, and drawbacks. These are mostly story-related,
but they might also add optional mechanical traits to your character’s
template. You can buy these right away with your starting points, or buy them
later with earned points like any other template trait.</p>

<h2 id="the-sixth-raven">The Sixth Raven</h2>

<p>Most surviving historical documents about the Silver Ravens say they were five
in number: Jackdaw the elf swashbuckler, Amyreid the half-elf cleric, Ba the
halfling wizard, Kyda the human bard, and Brakisi the human scout.</p>

<p>These documents were wrong. There was one other: you.</p>

<p>You were a small orphan child then, adopted by the group as a kind of mascot
somewhere along their career. You shared their love for Kintargo and its
freedom, but you were too young to go on any actual adventures, so you mostly
helped by running small errands, and heard from their big battles when they
returned to tell the tale.</p>

<p>This lasted until the last battle, the one against the massed armies of House
Thrune. Jackdaw sent you away with many of her other non-combatant friends the
day before that one, promising she’d call you back when the danger was past. She
never did, because the Ravens lost. Jackdaw surrendered so that the demonic army
would spare the city, and the others were either killed by Thrune agents over in
subsequent years or disappeared forever.</p>

<p>Over the following decades you would finally reach adulthood and set out on your
own, becoming an adventurer of some skill and renown elsewhere in the Inner Sea
region. Now, you’re ready to return home and finish the work of your
old friends. Your name has been struck from the history books, but your passion
burns as brightly as it ever did.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: You must belong to a species long-lived enough that you could
have been a child 70 years ago and still be of adventuring age in the
present. Being a dwarf or some kind of elf is enough, but the Half-Spirit
ancestries from DF 3 might also fit. Another alternative is to play a
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/02/07/warforged-variants.html">Warforged</a> who was an <em>active</em> member of the Ravens and spent some of the
intervening decades disabled and unconscious, but was recently repaired. You can
belong to any profession.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You remember things. The GM might occasionally give you hints and
clues about old Silver Raven safehouses and stashes. You also knew the Ravens
personally and they knew you - should any of them still be around, you will be
able to recognize each other.</p>

<p>You can add the Serendipity {15} trait to your template if it’s not already
present. This represents your memories of old Kintargo and Raven hangouts, and
might let you find useful shortcuts, items, and passages that are not
pre-written into the campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Things remember you. Demons, vampires, and other similarly
long-lived monsters who faced the original Ravens back in the day will recognize
you just as readily, and will be extra-mean to you as a result. Once word
spreads that you’re back, some of them might even travel to Kintargo for the
sole purpose of killing you.</p>

<p>This can be represented by the Enemy (Monster of the Week, 9 or less) {-15}
trait, which gets added as an optional disadvantage to your template.</p>

<p>If you only have the DFRPG, the disadvantage works like this: the GM rolls 3d6
in secret at the beginning of each adventure or each session of an extended
adventure. If the result is a 9 or less, a significantly powerful monster will
appear somewhere along the coming adventure or session, inserting itself into
one of the upcoming situations and making things more complicated and dangerous
for you and your group. It’s usually something complicated to fight, and not
necessarily the same monster every time. This is <em>in addition</em> to any
pre-existing monsters in the adventure who recognize you and want you dead.</p>

<h2 id="the-last-archivist">The Last Archivist</h2>

<p>You were a member of the Sacred Order of Archivists, a secret society made up of
worshipers of various deities of knowledge and wisdom. The Order was dedicated
to preserving the true history of Kintargo and other such “forbidden” knowledge
from Thrune redactors.</p>

<p>The Order is no more: its hideout was raided and ransacked by Thrune forces
during the Night of Ashes. You were away when it happened, on a mission to
retrieve an important document in another city. That’s why you survived. When
you returned, you reached out to a few contacts and learned that some of your
colleagues have surviving family. They were nobles and their family estate was
razed during the Night of Ashes, but one of their sons is still at large. You
are now trying to find this son, help him stay safe, and then get revenge on
House Thrune.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: None! While the Order is an excellent origin for Clerics,
Wizards, and other big brains, it could easily have employed fightier or
sneakier types as security or retrieval specialists.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: It’s impossible to be a member of the Archivists and not learn
<em>something</em>. In addition to being familiar with the Order’s hideout and its
procedures, you also know a bit of the region’s unredacted history and a few
other tidbits of unrelated but potentially useful knowledge. You can recognize
the Sixth Raven if run into them.</p>

<p>You can add the History and Research skills as an option to your template, and
also all specialties of Hidden Lore if they aren’t there already. You also add
Wild Talent {20} as an optional advantage, representing a large trove of random
knowledge. If you’re using the Basic Set, add Intelligence Analysis to your
template as well.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: You’re riven by grief and driven by revenge against Barzilai
Thrune and his minions. This might manifest as Intolerance (Diabolists) {-5}, an
Obsession (depose Thrune)(12) {-10}, or both! The Obsession might seem redundant
since it’s also the overall campaign goal, but it also compels you to take
potentially risky and unwise courses of action if they seem like they will yield
quicker results. It could also prevent you from retreating from a fight against
Thrune’s minions.</p>

<h2 id="knight-of-the-deep">Knight of the Deep</h2>

<p>You come from one of the subaquatic communities off the coast of Ravounel, where
you enjoy an heroic reputation. You recently went to visit your friend Aava in
the coastal village of Acisazi, only to find her missing and the village
suffering under a strange malaise. The village’s elder told you Aava had led a
small party of scouts into Kintargo to ask seek help breaking the curse, but she
never reported back. She begged you to find Aava, and you accepted.</p>

<p>You arrive at this land-lubber town to find it embroiled in a lot more trouble
than you thought possible. Aava is nowhere to be found and neither is her
contact, the singer Shensen. You suspect both of them vanished into the prisons
of the despotic Barzilai Thrune, and your queries have led you to the Aria Park
protest. You suspect you might need to bloody this human despot’s nose to
fulfill your mission, and that’s just fine with you.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: You must belong to a species capable of breathing underwater!
Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level contains two possible choices here: the Sea
Elf and the Water-Infused. From this blog, you might also pick the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html">Argonian</a>
or perhaps a <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/02/07/warforged-variants.html">Warforged</a> who has been modified to be hydrodynamic and
Amphibious. And of course we also have a whole article about the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2024/04/28/atlantis.html">Denizens of
the Sea</a> that also contains a few usable ancestries.</p>

<p>This theme is open to any profession, but martial types should probably keep in
mind the rules for <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html">underwater combat for fish-people</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: The people of Acisazi know and trust you, and Aava is your good
friend (or even a relative if you’re also a sea elf).</p>

<p>You can add Swimming, Aquabatics and Survival (Undersea) to your template as
optional skills, and should probably put some points in them during character
creation.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Add Obsession (find Aava and her scouts) (12) {-5} to your
template as an optional disadvantage. It’s what you already want to do anyway,
but like the Last Archivist’s Obsession it might drive you to unwise actions.</p>

<h2 id="phantom-thief">Phantom Thief</h2>

<p>You are one of Lady Docur’s School for Girls’ most distinguished graduates. You
had parted ways with your alma mater and set up shop in nearby Vyre, but a
recent letter from Lady Docur herself brought you back to Kintargo. The city’s
political climate is getting rather inhospitable to the school, and she hopes
you will be able to help them survive these turbulent times.</p>

<p>In other words: the school is currently the closest thing Kintargo has to a
thieves’ guild. They specialize in training secret couriers and the nicer sort
of thief. Thrune prefers the <em>nasty</em> sort of thief, so things might get
difficult for the school and its students. That’s where you come in.</p>

<p>Of course, you’re not here just to help your old school. You’re also, er, taking
a breather from some rather complex entanglements you left behind in the good
city of Vyre. Hopefully it will be a long while before you have to set foot
there again.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: It’s a school for girls, which means you either are a woman
or only discovered you <em>weren’t</em> after graduation. You must also be some manner
of Thief, either the base template or one of the variants from the corresponding
Dungeon Fantasy Denizens book.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You know Lady Docur and other characters associated with your alma
mater, and have their trust. You also know Vyre’s customs, which might come in
handy if you ever need to go back there.</p>

<p>Add Area Knowledge and Current Affairs for both Kintargo and Vyre to your
template, as well as Connoisseur, Savoir-Faire and the Fashion Sense
advantage. The School does give one a proper high society education.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Those Vyre entanglements will come back to haunt you if you ever
return there during the campaign.</p>

<p>No extra disadvantages here: everything which could make a thief’s life harder
is already part of the relevant templates.</p>

<h2 id="mysterious-satirist">Mysterious Satirist</h2>

<p>Even before Barzilai Thrune rolled in like he owned the place, you were already
well-known among Kintargo’s rebels, malcontents, and antifascists. Whether you
make poems, plays, essays, or songs, your work criticizing House Thrune was on
everybody’s minds and the pseudonym you chose for yourself was spoken in the
same tones as that of The Poison Pen and other such figures. Thrune’s opponents
speak it with admiration; his supporters, with disgust. That’s how you like it.</p>

<p>While no one has figured who you are yet, Barzilai’s arrival and the Night of
Ashes have made your life very difficult already. Most of your contacts among
Kintargo’s several resistance organizations have vanished, left town, or gone to
ground. While you still value your art, you also feel it’s time to engage in
more direct action against this dictator.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: None! While Bards obviously have a head start in terms of the
artistic skills implied by this theme, the Mysterious Satirist could be anyone.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: Choose one of the Bellflower Network, the Cult of Sarenrae, the
Rose of Kintargo, or the Poison Pen. You’re indirectly acquainted with that
group or individual. Though you have never met, you have corresponded and set up
pre-arranged signs that will let you recognize each other when the meeting does
happen.</p>

<p>Add the artistic or performance skills of your choice to your template, as well
as an appropriate Talent covering them to your optional advantages. Writing,
Poetry, and Musical Composition are appropriate if you share your work through
in written form. Public Speaking, Singing, Acting and Musical Instrument are
also good if you actually perform it. If you have the GURPS Basic Set, you can
also add Artist to the list of possible artistic skills, and you also add
Propaganda no matter what your medium is.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Add a 10-point Secret (Mysterious Satirist), Selfless, and
Trickster to your optional disadvantage list if they are not already there. The
first represents the risk of bad things happening when the authorities discover
who you are, above and beyond what being a Silver Raven would bring. The other
two represent possible reasons for you to have chosen this path in the first
place.</p>

<p>It’s time for me to put on my GM hat and begin preparing my solo Hell’s Rebels
campaign. As mentioned in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/07/08/lets-play-hells-rebels.html">previous post</a>, I want to play this using the
GURPS Dungeon Fantasy rule set instead of the campaign’s native Pathfinder
1e. Let’s take a look at what this means.</p>

<p>But wait a minute! Wasn’t that previous most published more than a year ago?
Well, turns out I started writing this one shortly after publishing it, but one
thing and another got in the way and I’m only getting around to publishing it
now. I’m actually a fair bit along in campaign preparation and even started
playing, I’m just behind on documenting the process. Anyway, let’s keep going.</p>

<h2 id="the-setting">The Setting</h2>

<p>As we all know by now, Hell’s Rebels takes place in Golarion, Pathfinder’s
setting. Golarion was built from the ground up to support dungeon fantasy
campaigns so we don’t have any fundamental friction between it and the Dungeon
Fantasy rules. Despite the many D&amp;D-isms of Pathfinder’s first edition we
already know the setting can easily be used with other systems, since it has an
official Savage Worlds port and Paizo itself is in the process of removing those
D&amp;D-isms from the latest iteration of their house system.</p>

<p>That being said, I do want to make a few changes to the version I’m going to
use. The most obvious one is I’m going to drop the many different fiend
classifications from D&amp;D and Pathfinder in favor of Dungeon Fantasy’s
simplified “it’s all demons from Hell”. Any of the demons from DF will be fair
game as opposition here.</p>

<p>And since I’m talking about setting changes, any mention I find of Cheliax’s
fascists and diabolists being in any way “disciplined” or “organized” despite
their evil will be altered because incompetence, corruption, and a disregard for
any rules lies at the heart of fascism. These fucks do not make the trains run
on time and never have. You do not, at any point, gotta hand it to them.</p>

<p>I also want to lean on the similarities between this campaign and Assassin’s
Creed Brotherhood, so we’ll be at a Renaissance tech level with early guns
widely available to guards and rebels. Make ready your blessed bullets, o devil
hunters.</p>

<h2 id="the-mechanics">The Mechanics</h2>

<p>I think this will mostly be pretty simple, because this won’t be the first time
I’m converting between Pathfinder and DF. I did already run the first two
volumes of Hell’s Rebels and the first three volumes of Iron Gods to different
player groups. During those times two issues jumped at me as being the most
difficult to handle.</p>

<p>The first one was treasure conversions, but I think I’ve arrived at a satisfying
process for that <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/06/25/dungeon-fantasy-wealth.html">in this post</a>. Our delvers will eventually end up very
wealthy, but I imagine the rebellion will prove to be a great money sink.</p>

<p>The other difficulty concerns the only somewhat common part of the dungeon
delving experience that’s harder to do in Dungeon Fantasy than in D&amp;D:
underwater adventures. There’s a couple of extended underwater segments in the
middle of the adventure path, and Pathfinder’s default items and spells for it
are a lot more accessible than Dungeon Fantasy’s.</p>

<p>But hey, it turns out I already solved that too! <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html">This post</a> collects the
underwater rules I’ll be using, and <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/11/13/underwater-items.html">this one</a> has a nice set of more
accessible items to let our PCs go for a swim and live to tell the tale. The
truth is that I started writing this post before I wrote the underwater ones, so
they were actually part of my effort to figure this campaign out.</p>

<p>Monster conversions used to be a big problem back when I started the Let’s Read,
but now I have enough DF monster books that I can swipe appropriate stat blocks
for nearly every one of them. If I need to create new ones for specific foes,
you can be sure I’ll post them here.</p>

            <p>I’ve published an article about <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html">underwater adventuring</a> in the past, in
which I mentioned that “fish-people” had several advantages over “land-lubbers”
when it came to mobility and fighting in an underwater environment. A later post
included <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/11/13/underwater-items.html">a few items</a> that could help those land-lubbers close the
gap… so how about we take a look at those fish-people now? As a bonus, you get
a nice little bundle of setting info you can drop on your campaign if you want.</p>

<h2 id="the-fate-of-atlantis">The Fate of Atlantis</h2>

<p>The name “Atlantis” figures in the myths and legends of many more places than it
should. Cultures that have never heard of each other have stories about an
empire that ruled the waves in ancient times but no longer exists. The stories
might differ but the name is always the same.</p>

<p>That’s because ancient Atlantis was the largest and most powerful underwater
civilization to ever exist. They discovered a means of traveling to other worlds
and exploited it with gusto.</p>

<p>Despite its power Atlantis eventually fell, as all empires do. The exact
sequence of events is more or less impossible to piece together, and mostly
irrelevant in the present day. The important bit is that their inter-world
travel network was the first thing to go, instantly fragmenting the
empire. That’s why each of them has a different story about how Atlantis fell -
those stories talk only about the bits of it they knew about. In some, it
happened overnight due to a cataclysm. In others, they eventually morphed into
successor cultures that might still be extant in the present day.</p>

<p>Aside from giving rise to a whole bunch of legends and to fueling the occasional
would-be despot’s ambitions, the most enduring legacy of Atlantis was its
underwater engineering. They pioneered a lot of the techniques that used to make
sturdy weapons and tools out of implausible aquatic materials like bone, shell,
coral, and mother-of-pearl. They were also the first civilization to
successfully make and work orichalcum.</p>

<p>But we’re not here to talk about <em>stuff</em>, we’re here to talk about <em>people</em>.</p>

<h2 id="so-lets-talk-about-people">So Let’s Talk About People</h2>

<p>Opinions differ on whether Atlantis was a Golden Age utopia or a despotic empire
whose downfall was a blessing to the world, but everyone agrees it was pretty
diverse. Unlike most typical dungeon fantasy kingdoms, its citizens belonged to
many different species with none of them making up an overwhelming majority of
the population.</p>

<p>Many of Atlantis’ citizens can be described using already-published stats. Sea
Elves and Water-Infused from GURPS DF 3: The Next Level fit very well, as do the
Argonians from <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html">this post</a>. The octopus- and shark-folk from GURPS Banestorm
are also good fits, though they’re a bit more complex and costly than the
standard for DF racial templates.</p>

<p>Below are a few new templates, with the overall goal of allowing a diverse
all-underwater party if the group wants to play that type of campaign. A couple
of the new ancestries I present here might have equivalent official templates
already, but since I don’t have those I’m writing new ones for my own use.</p>

<p>These templates assume that being Amphibious also makes you able to see and hear
unimpeded while submerged, and the ability to breathe underwater also makes you
able to speak there. I feel this is in line with the simpler feel of Dungeon
Fantasy. If you want to follow Banestorm’s assumptions instead, give all
templates here one level of Nictitating Membrane {1} and Speak Underwater {5},
increasing their costs by 6 points each.</p>

<h3 id="atlantean-20-points">Atlantean (20 points)</h3>

<p>This template describes people who are a product of successive generations of
intermarriage between the other species that made up the population of Atlantis,
and possibly some surfacers too. They are known as “Atlanteans” because their
general look became associated with that empire. Surprisingly, they look a lot
like humans even when they have no humans among their ancestors.</p>

<p>Atlanteans are warm-blooded, have legs, and can breathe both water and
air. Their human-looking bits exhibit the same ethnic variety as
humans. Individuals can also have a variable number of “fishy” traits like visible
gills, fins, blue or gray skin, and so on. These might be visually striking but
are never significant enough to count as more than 0-point features.</p>

<p>Atlanteans can appear in worlds that had an Atlantis, or those whose underwater
peoples are generally friendly with each other. The base stats could also be
used as they are or modified a bit to represent any species of underwater
humanoid.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Amphibious {10}, Gills {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Those fishy bits might count as varying levels of Unnatural
Features in a setting where almost everyone is human and the character is the
only known Atlantean, but in all other situations they’re 0-point traits. If the
character has something like rigid fins or a prominent tail growing out of their
lower back, they might need adapted body armor. This doesn’t cost extra, but
might restrict their usage of looted armor.</p>

<h3 id="crab-folk-40-points">Crab-Folk (40 points)</h3>

<p>Crab-folk are sapient humanoid crustaceans easily distinguished by their heavy
segmented carapaces. Like crabs, they lack distinct heads and their eyes are
located at the end of a pair of flexible, retractable stalks. Unlike crabs, they
only have the usual complement of humanoid limbs, though these are still
armored.</p>

<p>Crab-folk can operate normally on the surface, but their gills begin to dry out
if they go more than a day without being immersed in sea water. This means they
tend to stick close to the coast. Their voices sound strange and “bubbly”
outside the water, which most surfacers find off-putting.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: 360-degree Vision {25}; Amphibious {10}; Gills {10}; Damage
Resistance 5 (Cannot Wear Armor) {15}; No Neck {5};</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Cold-Blooded {-5}; Disturbing Voice (In Air, -50%) {-5},
Dependency (Sea water, Daily) {-15}.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Traits</strong>: If your campaign takes place far from a coastal area, the
Dependency disadvantage is worth -30 points, and the template therefore costs
only 25. Your local alchemist can prepare a solution close enough to seawater to
satisfy the requirement, but it’s still not free.</p>

<h3 id="deep-ones-50-points">Deep Ones (50 points)</h3>

<p>These humanoids are much more obviously “fishy” than Atlanteans, with an anatomy
closer to that of an abyssal fish than a human’s. They’re adapted to the
lightless depths of the ocean and that’s where they prefer to make their
homes. Deep Ones can swim up to the shallows without suffering ill effects, but
can’t breathe air.</p>

<p>After Atlantis fell, it was not uncommon for its Deep One settlements to become
more isolated and break contact with shallower or surface communities. This some
times gave rise to sinister legends and rumors about what they got up to down
there. These are mostly bunk: they are no more prone to worshiping Elder Things
than any other species.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Amphibious {10}, Dark Vision {25}, Fangs {2}, Gills {0},
Pressure Support 3 {15}, Tough Skin 1 {3}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Cold-Blooded {-5}.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Traits</strong>: A variant that can operate on the surface would be closer
to several classic D&amp;D fish-people. They have the 10-point version of Gills and
so cost that much more.</p>

<h3 id="merfolk-20-points">Merfolk (20 points)</h3>

<p>Merfolk are humanoid from the waist up and have fish bodies from the waist
down. They can breathe both air and water and have naturally melodious voices in
both mediums, but they require magic or assistive devices like wheelchairs to
operate on land. Their human halves display the same variance as Atlanteans, and
their fish halves can resemble a variety of species of fish, shark, or cetacean.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Gills {10}, Voice {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: No Legs (Aquatic) {0}.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>: The “Leg” and “Foot” hit locations on merfolk refer to their tail
and lower fins instead. Armor for those locations must be specially
constructed. As usual this doesn’t cost extra but limits which looted armor they
can use.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Traits</strong>: If your character’s fish half mimics a particularly speedy
species, they might have Enhanced Move 1 (Water) for an extra 20 points. At the
GM’s option, this might be a matter of training instead of biology, which means
any merfolk character can buy this with earned points as a power-up.</p>

<p>Hard Wired Island is a cyberpunk game published by Weird Age Games in 2020. It’s
a beefy 400 page tome comparable in size to the Shadowrun or CP RED cores, but
only about 25% of that is rules.</p>

<h2 id="setting-overview">Setting Overview</h2>

<p>Hard Wired Island takes place in Grand Cross, an O’Neil Cylinder habitat
orbiting Earth’s Lagrange 5 point, in the “distant future” of 2020. It was built
according to an idealistic plan in the wake of terrible environmental and
economic disasters on Earth, but is currently in the process of being co-opted
and corrupted by the interests of ultra-rich corporations and elites. The way in
which this is happening is described in very realistic detail throughout the
book, which also talks a bit about what people do to fight back. PCs are usually
expected to help in that fight, if not for moral reasons then because those
billionaires cause constant economic shocks that threaten their survival. This
is the main conflict in the setting.</p>

<p>Grand Cross has cybernetic implants, gene editing, fully sapient AI and
androids. However its “global net” is still pretty much the internet
of 2020. It’s even <em>named</em> “the internet”.</p>

<p>Every building in the station is wired for high-speed internet. The airwaves are
serviced by cell carriers like the ones you know from the real world, and some
of its wards even have free public wi-fi, though that tends to be poor quality
because capitalism is the worst virus. The station is linked to Earth’s internet
by satellites, with a 1.2-second lag there due to the physical distances
involved. Most big services have station-local data centers to try and get
around this, and there are some GC-native ones as well like HeoCities (website
hosting) and Pulser (a Crosser social network).</p>

<p>Hackers are simply called hackers. Their equipment is collectively known as a
Hacking Suite, and it can be anything from computers that wouldn’t look out of
place here in the real world to some fancy cybernetic implant. Target systems
tend to be private corporate intranets or other networks located on the station,
and whether hacking is done remotely or on-site depends on the specific mission.</p>

<h2 id="mechanics-overview">Mechanics Overview</h2>

<p>Most tests in Hard Wired Island use 2d6, with bonuses coming from one of the
PC’s main stats/approaches (Cool, Clever, Tough, and Quick), from a skill
specialty, from Augments (implants), and from Assets, which are special
equipment. There are rules for rolling with advantage/disadvantage (add a d6 and
drop the lowest/highest) or for Boosting rolls (add a d6, don’t drop
anything). Criticals happen when two or more dice roll the same value.</p>

<p>The system for hacking is a mixture of the systems for stealth and social
interaction. It has a set of specific actions associated with it, but also uses
some actions from those other systems.</p>

<p>Hackers begin each hacking attempt in a state called “Ghost”, meaning they
haven’t been detected by the target system’s security. They also begin with
three chances to avoid getting caught. Every time a hacker needs to do something
that requires a die roll, they might get caught if that test fails, and must
spend a chance in order to avoid that. If they fail a roll after running out of
chances, they’re discovered and their physical location is traced. Security is
on its way, but the hacker can still disconnect and try to run. A hacker can try
a Cover Your Tracks action to restore lost chances, but that’s also a roll so it
might backfire.</p>

<p>Target networks have two stats: a Network Level that determines the basic
difficulty of all tests made against it, and a Mood that describes the
strictness of its security procedures and how willing it is to let you do
things. Hacking is mostly about improving the network’s Mood towards
you. <em>Friendly</em> networks are helpful, giving Advantage for data searches within
then. <em>Indifferent</em> networks neither help nor hinder. <em>Hostile networks</em> assume
everyone is an intruder until they can prove otherwise.</p>

<p>Most networks start out Indifferent, and their mood can be improved to Friendly
through hacking actions, or degrade to Hostile by failures. Hostile networks
can’t have their mood improved except by gaining admin access. This can be done
by succeeding at a number of rolls equal to its Network Level, but it’s not
strictly necessary to accomplish your goals. Admin access on a network makes it
Friendly, and prevents its mood from lowering. Doing anything in there becomes
almost trivial and you only need to maintain Ghost if someone intelligent is
monitoring the network (like another admin or an AI).</p>

<p>There’s no deadly ice here, and no cybercombat at all. Getting discovered and
traced is usually enough of a threat here, since those armed goons will kill you
just as dead, and the heightened state of alertness from the target will also
complicate your teammates’ lives.</p>

<p>Hard Wired Island tries to abstract the extensive planning sessions players of
other games engage in with a resource named “Prep”. Before the mission itself
you use actions to gather both Individual and Group Prep, and you spend those
points during missions to use your Assets or acquire new ones on the spot.</p>

<h2 id="run-parameters">Run Parameters</h2>

<p>We do have a sample hacker here, the ever adorable Maru. Her Hacking Suite is
built into her cybereyes but she still operates it with a keyboard. She will be
going with the team on this one, which might mean leaving that keyboard behind
but won’t affect her effectiveness.</p>

<p>We will once again go with three separate target networks here. The office
network is level 5 and Friendly to access from the inside; the security network
used by the guards is Indifferent and level 6; and the isolated server is
Hostile and level 7.</p>

<p>If the first two detect intrusion they grow Hostile, trace Maru’s location, and
notify both the guards and the police. If the secret server detects intrusion it
will destroy itself in a very messy and noisy fashion, drawing guard
attention. This counts as a mission failure for our purposes, since the team
will spend the rest of the run trying to leave the office without the evidence
they came here to collect. As these are separate networks they have separate
Ghost counters.</p>

<h2 id="run-summary">Run Summary</h2>

<p>For the first time in our series we’ll have to concern ourselves with stuff that
happens before the mission itself. Let’s make an Individual Prep roll for
Maru. She’s getting her software in order before the run, at her hacker den. We
roll 2d6 + Clever + Hacking + Hacker’s Den against a difficulty of 7, and get
a 11. Since this is the first Prep roll we’re making, Maru gains 1 automatic
Prep, and an extra 1 Prep for beating the difficulty by 4. She takes part in
Group Prep later, and let’s say they agree to leave 1 of those points for her
use.</p>

<p>Now for the actual run. As always, the rest of the team manages to bullshit the
receptionist and make into the office posing as a repair crew. Maru locks
herself into a stall in the ladies’ room and begins.</p>

<p>The security network isn’t advertising itself, so I rule Maru needs a Search
roll to find it. Her bonus here is +3 from Clever and +2 from Hacking; the
difficulty is 11 (the network’s level + 5). She succeeds with 13.</p>

<p>Since there’s a lot she must do in this net, we spend 1 of her 3 Prep to
activate the Data Bomb program Asset, which gives her Advantage on her next
three rolls here.</p>

<p>I rule that opening the door and turning off the camera each require an Operate
roll. From what I see in the rules this seems to use the Drone specialty instead
of Hacking. Maru doesn’t have that, so she’s rolling only 2d6+3 from her
Clever. Thankfully, the Data Bomb still gives her Advantage on these rolls. She
succeeds at both rolls with a 12 and a 11, precisely because of that Advantage.</p>

<p>Maru and her team move to the records room, and find the secret server. She
jacks into it and begins searching for the data. The difficulties here are all
12 from the Network Level. Maru spends another Prep to activate the Ghost
Protocol program, giving her Advantage on her next Hacking roll and an extra
Ghost chance. These rolls <em>do</em> use her Hacking specialty.</p>

<p>Advantage once again lets her succeed with a 14. I think succeeding at this lets
her take the data? Let’s be cruel instead and ask for a Spoof roll to download
the data without authorization. This is a Hostile server after all. No more
advantage here, but she still gets a 13.</p>

<p>The team leaves the records room and Maru connects to the security wifi to open
the exit door. She still has one roll with Advantage remaining from her use of
Data Bomb, and succeeds on the Spoof roll with a 13.</p>

<p>With the way out secured, she searches the office network for the money. No roll
needed to locate it, it’s Friendly and advertising itself to people inside the
office premises. A Search with Advantage lets her find the money with a roll of
11 versus the network’s lower difficulty of 10.</p>

<p>She has no advantage for the Spoof roll to transfer the money elsewhere, but she
still succeeds with a 11.</p>

<p>Mission accomplished! Time elapsed: around 15 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="run-analysis">Run Analysis</h2>

<p>Hard Wired Island feels more complex than Neon City Overdrive in its
presentation, but the hacking sequence here was about as fast. This was in part
due to good rolls all through the run, but a failure here would have had less
impact than in my Neon City run. There, a failed roll would have meant
cybercombat, a system I didn’t get to try at all. Here it would have meant an
extra roll or two as I lost one of my Ghost points and retried the test. Perhaps
I’d have spent another action or two recovering those points as well.</p>

<p>Keeping it to about one roll per Thing You Do seems to be key to keeping hacking
brief.</p>

        </h1>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>And finally we get to look at the Thayan cities and the road between them.</p>

<h2 id="veil">Veil</h2>

<p>The town of Veil is so named because it’s built atop a stable rift to the
Shadowfell, which makes it look like it’s covered by a veil of shadows from
afar. This is where Shadowfell Road ends. Valindra’s people are very aware of
that, so they’re busy fortifying the town and bringing in undead defenders to
gradually replace its living garrison. Should the down fall or the rift close,
their Neverwinter contingent would be cut off.</p>

<p>The rift also protects Veil from direct bombardment by the flying fortress, as
it makes its shadow-powered projectiles go astray. Its defenses cannot stand up
to a Netherese ground assault, but the attacking army would risk getting caught
between Veil’s defenders and a relief force sent from Surcross. The fortress
therefore focuses on the bigger town, but sometimes comes here to float
ominously over Veil and throw some rocks at it. As we saw before it does this
when it needs to take in supplies, as its own Shadowfell portals require
proximity to a rift to work.</p>

<p>The city’s defenses are led by a priest of Bane named Renault Abrecht, who
coordinates everything from the local temple he took over. When not doing that,
Abrecht spends his time ensuring the forces under his command are more loyal to
him than to Thay, and acquiring more converts from the town’s stressed-out
population. When he judges he has a big enough army of followers, he will cross
into Shadowfell Road and collapse the rift behind him, hoping to conquer a
kingdom for himself elsewhere in Faerûn. The Netherese would actually love that,
as it would achieve their own goal of cutting off Valindra’s supply route.</p>

<h2 id="the-road">The Road</h2>

<p>The road linking Veil and Surcross is warded and trapped to a frankly ridiculous
level, because the Thayans rightly fear that if it got taken then Veil would
fall soon after.</p>

<p>Both sides of the road are lined with stakes upon which are impaled
bodies. These are enchanted to animate, jump from the stakes, and kill anyone
who attacks the town of Veil or a Thayan national while on the road. Under the
road itself are a series of deadly necromantic rune traps that activate when
anyone living steps on them. They deactivate for five minutes if an <em>undead</em>
being steps on them, so caravans to and from Surcross use zombie guides to
travel the road.</p>

<p>I guess it’s possible for the PCs to travel overland between the two cities
without using the road, since by this point they should be able to navigate the
area’s environmental hazards without much trouble. Armies, however, would prefer
to use the road if they can, and supply caravans must use it.</p>

<h2 id="surcross">Surcross</h2>

<p>Tam was smart enough to foresee any serious attack against Thay would have to go
through Surcross, so he had potent defenses installed in the city a long time
ago. However he couldn’t imagine that the actual attack would come in the form
of a whole Netherese flying fortress, and the particulars of that attack lead to
the current stalemate.</p>

<p>Surcross is a town under permanent martial law. It’s governed by the military
garrison stationed here to fight the Netherese. Its civilian population is
suffering greatly because the soldiers requisition all the food for themselves,
and don’t hesitate to kill any who complain about it or displease them in other
ways. A dead Thayan is just an undead Thayan in waiting, after all.</p>

<p>Getting into the town is hard and will require some ingenuity from the
party. Once inside, though, they can easily pass for residents, because who in
their right mind would want to break <em>into</em> the place?</p>

<p>The town’s governor is Ukulsid, an undead gnoll general who is entirely focused
on the war effort, and therefore dislikes the fact that his town also became the
center of Valindra’s schemes. His loyalty to Tam forces him to obey her, though,
because she outranks him.</p>

<h3 id="external-defenses">External Defenses</h3>

<p>The gates of Surcross are made of necromantically animated bone. They open and
close themselves at the orders of Thayan military necromancers, and will attack
others who linger close to them for too long like the animated wall traps we saw
earlier in the Dread Ring.</p>

<p>The wall surrounding Surcross is pretty solid, and also festooned with hundreds
of hidden crypts. If the wall is breached or bypassed by enemy forces, a single
command will trigger a selective zombie apocalypse. Every corpse within the wall
will be animated and the shambling army will be sent into the town to kill every
non-Thayan they find.</p>

<h3 id="fingers-of-szass-tam">Fingers of Szass Tam</h3>

<p>These five bone and marble towers are the reason Surcross hasn’t been flattened
yet. Located at equidistant points around the perimeter of the city wall, they
can project force fields over the city. They can’t cover the whole city for
long, so the towers usually project stronger but smaller fields over whatever
parts of it are being bombarded.</p>

<p>The towers have no windows, but their walls are enchanted to “not exist” to
anyone inside them. They’re filled with arcane artillery pieces similar to those
that defend the plateau, whose crews can see and fire through the walls just
fine. They also have assault units ready to deploy to anywhere inside the city
or to just outside its walls by marching on force field bridges.</p>

<h3 id="the-garrison">The Garrison</h3>

<p>Another important structure in Surcross’ defense, the garrison houses all living
Thayan troups stationed in town. It’s guarded around the clock by undead. Its
barracks are not segregated by gender, but by species: human, orc/half-orc,
gnoll, and “other”. It has short-range teleportation circles that can move
soldiers instantly to the front gate or to any of the five Fingers.</p>

<p>A particularly luxurious section of the garrison is reserved for the Sunmasters,
a contingent of Bane clerics and star warlocks who specialize in radiant
attacks. They mostly work as a special strike force against the Shadovar, or
when there’s an emergency and they need every soldier in the field.</p>

<h3 id="the-tombstone">The Tombstone</h3>

<p>This squat fortress at the very center of town is where its leadership
resides. Its windows and doors can be commanded to meld into the walls and
disappear, allowing it to serve as a last redoubt if the wall is breached.</p>

<p>Ukulsid holds court here and lets people petition him for judgment on disputes
or to make other requests and complaints, but since he tends to draft those who
annoy him into the army, few people make use of the opportunity.</p>

<p>The building also contains an enchanted audience chamber that’s a perfect
replica of the one Szass Tam uses in his palace. It’s one of many such chambers
spread throughout Thay. The lich can sit in his throne in the original chamber
and establish a link with any of the replicas, causing an illusion of him to
appear on the corresponding throne. This lets him talk to anyone inside the
replica chambers as if he was there, and lets him forcibly teleport people
inside the replica chamber to the original one if he wants. Ukulsid occasionally
uses this room to report to his boss. PCs should probably avoid lingering here.</p>

<p>Valindra has an area reserved for her use underneath the Tombstone as well. This
currently stores a large and still growing collection of dragon bones, guarded
by skeletal guardians hidden among them. Valindra is stocking up in preparation
for the time when she learns the ritual to raise dracoliches.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Surcross looks like an even worse place than Evernight, and that’s saying
something. PCs who make it inside the walls will have some freedom of movement,
but still their stay there will resemble a dungeon delve more than a city
adventure. Nowhere is safe, no one can be trusted, and you ideally want to do
what you came to do and leave as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>If the PCs main reason for coming to Thay is to disrupt the Thayan supply lines,
then Veil is probably their best bet, since the portal can be closed without
them needing to destroy either city. If the GM says Valindra’s Soul Vessel is
here in Thay, though, then its most likely hiding place is her bone collection
under Surcross’ Tombstone.</p>
