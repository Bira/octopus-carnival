<p>This post is part of a series! Click [here][1] to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>This entry goes on and on about how stupid brohgs are, but I think that’s
terribly unfair to them. They’re some of the nicest people we’ve met in this
reading so far.</p>

<p>These four-armed giant-kin wander the wastes in small nomadic bands that
occasionally cross paths to trade gossip and partners. They’re extremely skilled
at surviving the environment in Athas, taking only what they need and leaving
little trace of their passage. Their strong primal magic tradition helps them
with this.</p>

<p>Of course, being both big and relatively peaceful makes them frequent targets
for the many odious slaver organizations in this setting, so they often end up
captured and put to work as heavy laborers, muscle, or gladiators. Enslaved
brohg who manage to break free often seek employment as mercenaries.</p>

<p>Brohgs have both an innate ability to sense arcane magic, and an intense
cultural distrust of it, as they associate all arcane magic with defiling and
believe it to be cursed. Very rarely, a brohg will be born with innate arcane
potential (like a PC sorcerer). These individuals end up exiled from their
communities, as they’re believed to be hosts to “evil spirits” and destined to
bring disaster. Left to fend for themselves with no support, they often end up
creating a self-fulfilling prophecy scenario and becoming cruel defilers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Brohgs are Large Natural Humanoids with the Giant tag. They move at a relatively
slow speed of 6, and have low-light vision. They have four arms and are
ambidexterous, but that doesn’t translate into a specific trait in their stat
blocks - each one has different abilities related to training.</p>

<h3 id="brohg-hurler">Brohg Hurler</h3>

<p>Hurlers are civilians without a lot of combat training, but they get by just
fine by throwing stuff really far away, be that stuff boulders or
enemies. They’re Level 10 Artillery with 82 HP.</p>

<p>Their basic Reach 2 <strong>Slam</strong> attack lets them grab the target on a hit, which is
hilarious because they can then use <strong>Hurl Away</strong> to throw them 10 squares at
another creature, further damaging the “ammunition” as an effect and making a
ranged attack against the second target. For rules purposes, this counts as a
push that leaves the hurled creature adjacent to the second target.</p>

<p>If no one’s stupid enough to get within arm’s reach of a hurler, they can hurl a
<strong>rock</strong> instead, which does similar damage, pushes the target 2 squares, and
knocks it prone.</p>

<h3 id="brohg-warrior">Brohg Warrior</h3>

<p>This is what a trained brohg combatant looks like. When a brohg community is
under attack, warriors step up to cover their retreat. This could also represent
an enslaved or mercenary brohg working for someone else. Warriors are armed with
2 spears, a shield, and a hand kept free to throw rocks. They’re Level 10 Elite
Soldiers with 212 HP.</p>

<p>They can attack with a <strong>spear</strong> that marks for a turn or a thrown <strong>rock</strong> that
knocks prone, and <strong>Double Attack</strong> lets them do that twice in an action in any
combination.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Brohg Taunt</strong> ability is a minor action that lets them mark everyone in
a Close Burst 2, and recharges when they’re bloodied. If a marked enemy within 2
squares moves, the brohg can use <strong>Battle Alacrity</strong> to get a free attack on
them that does light damage and lets then shift 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="brohg-renegade">Brohg Renegade</h3>

<p>One of those banished sorcerers who went all in on defiling magic, and now
wanders alone or at the head of a villainous band, plotting to increase his
power. The Renegade is a Level 13 Solo Controller with 512 HP.</p>

<p>This defiler knows an <strong>Arcane Secret</strong> that lets them roll saves against daze
or stun effects both at the start and end of its turn, even if that effect
doesn’t allow a save (i.e., by having a fixed duration instead). Its <strong>dagger</strong>
basic attack is a <em>minor</em> action that does normal damage, and a little bit of
extra force damage if the target doesn’t end their next turn at least two
squares away from the renegade.</p>

<p>Its standard actions are all spells.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Entropy Belt</strong> (ranged 10 vs. will) targets one to three creatures, dealing
psychic damage and pushing 3 squares on a hit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defiling Vortex</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Fort, recharges when bloodied) deals no
damage on a hit, but instead knocks targets prone and weakens then (save
ends). Missed enemies take necrotic damage. At the end of all this, the
renegade gains 5 temp HP for every target it hit with the power.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defiling Blast</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Ref, recharge 5+) does necrotic damage
and dazes (save ends). The renegade gains a +4 to all damage while any target
remains dazed by this power.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And as it suits a solo, we also get a ton of triggered actions. The renegade has
the same <strong>Variable Resistance</strong> as a demon, usable 2 times per encounter. To
refresh our memories: the value of this resistance is 10, and when the renegade
takes elemental damage it can switch the resistance to resist that damage type
as a free action, up to the encounter limit, when the resistance retains its
final type.</p>

<p>If an enemy hits the renegade while granting combat advantage to it, the
renegade can cast a <strong>Wrath Sphere</strong> (close burst 1 vs. Fort) against that
enemy, dealing force damage and pushing it 2 squares on a hit. And when the
renegade is first bloodied, <strong>Bloodied Defiling</strong> triggers to let it immediately
recharge and use Defiling Blast again.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of stuff, but that’s a solo for you. Almost dragon-like, this one.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Free broghs have no reason to quarrel with PCs unless provoked, and if that
happens the warriors will cover the retreat of the rest of the group while
hurlers help from further away. They might also keep several of the hardy beasts
described in this book, and they might help in a fight too.</p>

<p>Enslaved or mercenary individuals might be found in mixed sapient encounter
groups. Renegade defilers will often be <em>leading</em> such a villain group. A single
renegade is a nice “welcome to paragon tier” boss fight. One plus some
lieutenants makes for a nice set piece battle for mid-paragon heroes.</p>

<p>I like their mechanics and I like parts of their lore, but as I already
mentioned I don’t like the way the book keeps saying how brohgs are stupid and
simple-minded, and how it manages to make them superstitious despite living in a
D&amp;D world and having their own working magical tradition. Distrusting arcane
magic in Dark Sun is sensible, but having the brohgs do it because they falsely
believe it’s a curse from evil spirits is a step too far in my opinion.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Braxats used to be natural beasts long ago, but according to the book were
uplifted by a “grim magical influence” over centuries of exposure to become the
huge and extremely antisocial insectile/reptilian humanoids they are today.</p>

<p>Braxats view all relationships, including those with other braxats, in terms of
dominance and coercion. They treat anyone weaker than them with contempt at
best, viciously hate anyone they see as equals, and only grudginly submit to
those they perceive as stronger. Each group is smaller than the one before, of
course. They have a particularly hate for half-giants for some reason.</p>

<p>Sometimes one of Athas’ many shady organizations manages to convince young
braxats to work for them as muscle through either bribery or intimidation. This
never lasts long, as the creatures are incapable of forming true loyalties and
either leave or betray their bosses if they survive and grow strong enough.</p>

<p>That same emphasis on coercion also applies to braxat reproduction
(yikes!). Braxats reproduce when there’s enough surplus food to go around, and
lay their eggs in secluded caves and other similar shelters.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Braxats are Natural Humanoids, with young specimens starting at Large and adults
reaching Huge size. They have Speed 8, acid resistance that increases with tier,
low-light vision, and the <strong>Threatening Reach</strong> trait, which means they can make
opportunity attacks against anyone inside their full melee reach, not just
adjacent enemies. They rely on their carapace for protection and use their fists
or heavy clubs as weapons. They can also spit acid and use psychic powers,
though the exact mechanics vary on each stat block.</p>

<h3 id="braxat-juvenile">Braxat Juvenile</h3>

<p>A still-young individual that’s nevertheless old and large enough to strike out
on its own. As mentioned above, some juveniles are conditioned from an early age
to view another creature as its superior, but that only lasts until the braxat
grows large and smart enough to see it’s stronger. Mercenary arrangements tend
to last a bit more. Many juveniles never grow to see adulthood, dying during
their work as muscle for Athas’ various villainous organizations.</p>

<p>Juveniles are Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They’re “merely” size Large, and have
Acid Resistance 10. Their melee attacks are reach 2 and consist of either a
basic <strong>Slam</strong> that marks for a turn on a hit, or a <strong>Thrash</strong> ability that does
the same damage and knocks prone on a hit.</p>

<p>At range, they can use their <strong>Caustic Spit</strong> (ranged 5 vs. Reflex) to deal
immediate and ongoing acid damage, also slowing the target (save ends
both). When a marked enemy within 3 squares tries to move away from the
juvenile, they can use a <strong>Telekinetic Barrier</strong> as an interrupt to slide the
enemy back towards a square adjacent to the braxat.</p>

<h3 id="braxat-raider">Braxat Raider</h3>

<p>A typical adult specimen, now grown to Huge size. It wanders the wastes alone or
with a small band of followers, setting up camp near caravan routes or villages
that they periodically raid for livestock and people to eat.</p>

<p>Raiders are Level 14 Elite Soldiers with 280 HP. Their melee reach is 3, and
their acid resistance is 15. They fight with <strong>greatclubs</strong> whose basic attacks
damage and slide 1 square on a hit, and mark for a turn as an effect. They can
also be used for <strong>Greatclub Sweeps</strong> (recharge 5+) that target a Close Burst 2
and knock prone on a hit.</p>

<p>The raider’s acid spit is a <strong>Scathing Spray</strong> (Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex,
recharges when first bloodied) that has similar effects to the juvenile’s spit
on anyone it hits, and does half damage on a miss. Its TK barrier evolves to
<strong>Telekinetic Harness</strong> (immediate reaction), letting it pull marked enemies
that end their turns not adjacen to the raider up to 6 squares.</p>

<p>They also get an entirely new psychic power: <strong>Agonize</strong> (ranged 10 vs. will)
deals psychic damage and slows for a turn, and doesn’t provoke opportunity
attacks when used.</p>

<h3 id="braxat-lord">Braxat Lord</h3>

<p>Braxats who live to reach the peak of their power are strong enough to set
themselves up as regional despots, as only the most powerful creatures in Athas
can hope to win against them. They view pretty much anyone else as either
potential slaves, or potential meals.</p>

<p>The Braxat Lord is a Level 23 Elite Soldier with 428 HP and 20 acid
resistance. Like the Raider, it’s Huge and its melee reach is 3. It fights with
a <strong>Maul</strong> that damages and slides 2 squares on a hit, and marks for a turn as
an effect. It can attack at range with the <strong>Crushing Pain</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Fort) psychic power, which deals psychic damage, immobilizes for a turn, and
slows for another turn as an aftereffect. The <strong>Attack Flurry</strong> power lets it
use the maul twice and Crushing Pain once in the same standard action, against 2
or 3 targets.</p>

<p>Its acid spit power is <strong>Vitriolic Spew</strong>, a Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex that deals
immediate and ongoing acid damage. It also turns the blast area into lightly
obscured difficult terrain that deals acid damage to anyone ending their turn
inside, and lasts until the end of the lord’s next turn.</p>

<p>The psychic powers don’t end there either! <strong>Overawe</strong> (recharge 5+) is a minor
action Close Burst 10 that targets all creatures marked by the lord, deals
psychic damage, makes them grant combat advantage, and forbids them from using
opportunity or immediate actions (save ends both). And its <strong>Telekinetic
Harness</strong> works like the raider’s but also restrains those pulled by it and
deals ongoing psychic damage (save ends both).</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think the encounter examples are pretty well described above. As for my
impressions, braxats seem to be some of the worst people in Athas, and that’s
saying something. They feel like Darker and Sunnier evil ogres or giants. The
three variants slot neatly into the ogre/giant/titan role, respectively.</p>

<p>What do fey look like in a world whose environment as deeply fucked up as
Athas’? Let’s check it out.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Belgoi (singular and plural are the same) lived in the Feywild before it was
destroyed in ancient Athasian history, and they weren’t the most pleasant of fey
back them. They took refuge in the world, but eventually came to hate it and all
its residents. Now they live to despoil everything they touch.</p>

<p>Belgoi organize into small nomadic tribes led by the strongest member. They’ll
stop at a location and live there for a while, moving on when everything around
them is ruined, consumed, or polluted. They often go out hunting, and will eat
anything and anyone they can catch. They prefer sapient victims because they
think meat tastes better when seasoned with terror, and that eating someone lets
them absorb the victim’s power. That’s why they also eat their own dead.</p>

<p>Eladrin are their preferred victims, since the belgoi blame them for the
destruction of their homelands.</p>

<p>Belgoi wear leather or hide armor, which I guess is true of most fighters on
Athas. They fight with claw or spear, and wield small bells which they use to
channel their magic. Ringing the bell allows them to lure targets closer for the
kill, isolating them from their peers and breaking their formations.</p>

<p>This makes me think their name is a horrible pun (belgoi == “bell guy”).</p>

<p>Some of them have the ability to drain a victim’s life force through the wounds
they inflict. You can see it seeping out and flowing into the creature.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Belgois are Medium Fey Humanoids with Speed 6 and Low-Light Vision. They speak
Common, and all of the stat blocks here are Chaotic Evil. Their signature trait
is that they’re <strong>Hungry For Blood</strong>, which makes all their attacks deal extra
damage against bloodied targets. All of them also have a bell-related power,
which is a little different for each variant.</p>

<h3 id="belgoi-craven">Belgoi Craven</h3>

<p>The weakest and most cowardly of their number, hiding behind more powerful
warriors and waiting for the chance to pounce upon weak or isolated enemies.</p>

<p>These are Level 7 Minion Skirmishers, whose <strong>Craven Slink</strong> gives them a +2
bonus to all defenses when adjacent to an ally (even another craven). Their
<strong>claw</strong> is a standard minion basic attack, and their <strong>Compelling Ring</strong>
(ranged 10 vs. Will, Encounter) can slide the target 5 squares to a square
adjacent to the craven or one of their allies. Dangerous when the more powerful
variants are around!</p>

<h3 id="belgoi-stalker">Belgoi Stalker</h3>

<p>Not every belgoi belongs to a tribe. Stalkers usually travel alone, but can
sometimes join up with mixed humanoid bands that have similar inclinations. They
will also opportunistically insert themselves into ongoing fights, trying to
lure a victim out while they’re busy with other enemies. And you can also just
say a given stalker is with a tribe too, of course. They’re Level 7 Lurkers with
63 HP.</p>

<p>Stalkers will star the fight at a distance, and use the <strong>Enticing Ring</strong>
(Ranged 10 vs. Will) of their bells to lure a target. On a hit the target is
pulled 5 squares and dazed for a turn. The stalker then moves up and uses its
basic <strong>Claw</strong> attack, which deals light physical damage and ongoing 5 damage
(save ends). If the target is dazed, like they would be in this scenario, the
ongoing damage is increased to 15 and the <em>Stalker</em> takes a -5 penalty to its
defenses until the start of its next turn, giving it an incentive to stay
away.</p>

<h3 id="belgoi-hunter">Belgoi Hunter</h3>

<p>Hunters are the main frontline units of a Belgoi attack, engaging enemies
directly with their spears and trying to make them vulnerable to the attacks of
their sneakier fellows. They’re Level 8 Soldiers with 89 HP.</p>

<p>Hunters fight with their <strong>spears</strong>, but instead of charging into the fray
they’ll try to draw enemies to them with the <strong>Ringing Attraction</strong> of their
bells. This minor action power attacks the Will of all enemies in a Close
Burst 5. On a hit, the hunter pulls the target 3 squares and marks it.</p>

<p>The hunter can then use its <strong>Stakeout</strong> attack against an enemy it has marked,
which deals the same damage as the basic spear strike and immobilizes the target
for a turn.</p>

<p>This set of powers is perfect for a tactic where hunters get the party’s
defenders out of position so a large horde of cravens or a stalker can slip
through.</p>

<h3 id="belgoi-caller">Belgoi Caller</h3>

<p>Callers usually lead belgoi tribes and hunting bands. They’re visibly more
powerful than their followers, and have access to stronger magic and psychic
powers that help their allies and hinder their foes. Not every hunting band will
have a caller in it, but when they show up they’re bad news. Callers are Level 8
Elite Controllers with the Leader tag and 178 HP.</p>

<p>They can fight with <strong>Claws</strong> that damage and inflict ongoing 5 damage (save
ends), but their actions are better spent on their <strong>Ennui Lash</strong> power (minor
action, melee 3 vs. Will), which does equivalent psychic damage and inflicts a
-2 penalty to Will for a turn. That opens the enemy up to their bigger powers,
and to the psychic attacks of their buddies.</p>

<p>The first big power is <strong>Command of the Bell</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will, recharge
4+), which deals psychic damage, slides the target 3 squares, and forces them to
make an at-will attack against an ally of the caller’s choice. Not a basic
attack, an <em>at-will</em> attack.</p>

<p>The other big power is <strong>Distant Ringing</strong> (area burst 3 within 10 vs. Will,
recharge when first bloodied), which deals psychic damage to enemies caught
inside and pulls them towards the center of the burst. Allies caught inside can
shift 1 square and roll a save.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Encounters with groups of belgoi are pretty similar to the ones described for
the lone stalker above. They creep around the party trying to stay undetected
until their targets are vulnerable or engaged in another fight, try to lure and
kill as many victims as they can.</p>

<p>They’ll use clever ambush tactics and take advantage of terrain as much as
possible, but don’t seem to like surrendering or talking. They always begin with
the ambush, and run away if things don’t go their way, possibly to return later
for revenge.</p>

<p>I like their mechanics, but I’ll admit I can’t get over the pun. Bell
guys. Sigh.</p>

members stick close to each other but most fend for themselves, feeding on weeds
and small animals and accumulating water in a sac under their shell. When one of
them detects large prey it alerts the others, and the entire pack works together
for the big meal ticket.</p>

<p>All baazrags are born female, but only a few manage to reach the right size,
age, and biochemical triggers to become egg-laying breeders. When a breeder is
present, some of the other baazrags will become male, and will help fertilize
and defend the eggs. Breeders and other powerful baazrags have some innate
psychic sensitivity - proximity to psychic characters irritates them, making
them more hostile.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Bazraags are Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag. Like most monster tags, it
does nothing by itself but some effects may key off it. Most specimens are
Medium, but Whelps are Small and breeders are Large. Their signature trait is
<strong>Pack Harrier</strong>, a passive trait which gives them combat advantage against any
target surrounded by two or more of their allies. They have a ground speed of 8,
so good lock outrunning them when they find you.</p>

<h3 id="baazrag-whelp">Baazrag Whelp</h3>

<p>Baazrags are capable of fighting from the moment they hatch, but they’re still
too vulnerable to strike out on their own and so stick close to their
mother. When they grow up a little more, they join the other members of the pack
in their semi-independent activities.</p>

<p>Whelps are Level 1 Minion Skirmishers with the signature traits mentioned above,
plus the <strong>Scrambler</strong> trait that lets them ignore difficult terrain when they
shift. Their <strong>bite</strong> does the kind of damage you’d expect from a Level 1
Minion, which isn’t anything spectacular.</p>

<h3 id="baazrag-gnawer">Baazrag Gnawer</h3>

<p>A particularly tenacious hunter that strays a bit further from the pack to act
as a scout. It’s usually the first to spot large prey and warn its companions,
and when it bites down it doesn’t let go.</p>

<p>Gnawers are Level 1 Skirmishers with 29 HP and all the standard traits. It also
has the <strong>Latcher</strong> trait, which gives it +2 AC when it’s latched onto a victim
(see below).</p>

<p>The gnawer’s <strong>Bite</strong> does a lot of work here. It deals standard damage on a hit
and lets the creature latch onto the target, which works like a custom status
effect. While the gnawer is latched on a target, it moves when the target moves,
without provoking opportunity attacks, and can stop at any unoccupied square
adjacent to the target at the destination. It can obviously only latch onto one
creature at a time.</p>

<p>While the gnawer is latched, it can use the <strong>Gnaw</strong> attack, which on a hit
deals heavy physical damage, ongoing 5 poison (save ends) and lets the creature
detach and shift 2 squares.</p>

<p>The main difference between having a gnawer attached and being grabbed is that
the target is not immobilized. Therefore, even though the stat block doesn’t say
it, I’d let PCs treat it like a grab for purposes of escaping it early. On the
other hand, while a gnawer can only grab one target, <em>multiple</em> gnawers can
attach to the same target. Don’t let it happen!</p>

<p>Finally, as a move action, the gnawer can use <strong>Bounder</strong> to jump 4 squares
without provoking opportunity attacks. This is at-will, so it’s a very slippery
creature if you don’t have a fighter with you.</p>

<h3 id="baazrag-swarm">Baazrag Swarm</h3>

<p>One whelp is nearly harmless, but the whole litter at once is bad news. This
is a Medium swarm, counting as a Level 3 Soldier with 46 HP. They have the usual
swarm resistances: half damage from melee and ranged attacks, vulnerable 5
against close and area attacks.</p>

<p>Like all Swarms, this one can occupy the same space as its enemies, and its area
counts as difficult terrain. It cannot be pushed, pulled or slid by melee or
ranged attacks, and can squeeze past any opening big enough for an individual
member without penalty. In this case, the members are probably Small. It also
has Pack Harrier, and a <strong>Hinder</strong> aura (1) that slows enemies who start their
turns inside. Being inside the swarm also counts as being inside the aura,
obviously.</p>

<p>Their basic melee attack is <strong>Bloodthirsty Swarm</strong>, which deals extra damage
against prone targets. Their other attack is of course <strong>Pull Down</strong>, which
damages and knocks prone on a hit.</p>

<p>These things are <em>slightly</em> less dangerous <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2020/01/27/drakes.html">needlefang drake swarms</a>. They’re
higher level and do more base damage, but their aura doesn’t give them
additional free attacks against prone targets. This means they will probably
leave incapacitated PCs alone while other enemies remain in the map, though
those would still be fair game if nothing else is in reach.</p>

<h3 id="baazrag-breeder">Baazrag Breeder</h3>

<p>A typical baazrag who managed to grow and develop the ability to lay eggs. It’s
Large in size, and a Level 5 Brute with 77 HP. I’m guessing not every old-enough
baazrag will reach this state - it might be something related to hormones, like
in an insect hive.</p>

<p>The breeder upgrades her Pack Harrier trait to <strong>Pack Master</strong>, and only needs
one other adjacent ally to gain Combat Advantage against a target. She can
attack with a basic <strong>Claw</strong> attack or with a <strong>Bite</strong> that deals bonus damage
against prone targets and inflicts ongoing 5 poison (save ends) on a hit.</p>

<p>She also has psychic powers! <strong>Psychic Lure</strong> is a minor action Close Burst 5
vs. Will that targets one enemy and pulls them 3 squares on a hit. And that
irritability when near other psychic sources translates into the <strong>Psychic
Provocation</strong> reaction, which lets the breeder immediately charge anyone who
deals psychic damage to her once per turn.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Baazrags look like typical random encounters during wilderness travel, but
depending on how the PCs are doing in their trek they could also seek the
creatures out to harvest their water sacs and meat.</p>

<p>The first sign of a baazrag pack is the lone scout that will make an effort to
call its buddies when it finds the party. Then they’ll swarm the prey and try to
pull it down for the kill, but will give up if they think the prey is too tough
and the fight is going against them.</p>

<p>Breeders, if present, stay a bit further away and try to lure a lone victim with
Psychic Lure. If they manage it, they’ll attack the isolated PC with the help of
any nearby young.</p>

<p>Individual adult Baazrags could all be represented by gnawers, though you could
also reskin Gray Wolves from the Monster Vault as other baazrag adults. Any and
all of these might be found as members of humanoid encounter groups as guard and
war animals, just like the beasts they replace.</p>

<p>I have no idea if anakores appeared before. This is the first time I’ve read
about them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Little is known about the origins of these creatures. Ancient tales speak of a
terror from beyond the sky that touched their humanoid ancestors, causing them
to recoil from the sun and seek shelter underground. Over time, these ancestors
became today’s anakores.</p>

<p>Anakores live in small hunter-gatherer bands led by their most accomplished
tracker. They burrow beneath the desert sands during the day, and from there
they can feel the vibrations of prey passing overhead, and smell blood spilled
on the ground. When anakores detect prey, they can follow it all day by
tunneling through the sands, waiting until nightfall to spring their ambush from
below. Then they will fight with their powerful digging claws and their
paralytic bites.</p>

<p>While on the move, the creatures subsist on plant roots, including certain
poisonous species that help the formation of their venom. Rootless vegetation
spread around an area is a possible signt of anakore presence, though they’re
smart enough to clean this up if they intend to stay in place for a while.</p>

<p>Different band members specialize in different parts of an attack - some lead
the ambush, others strike to hurt and incapacitate victims, and yet others drag
those victims underground.</p>

<p>I guess a lot of the time they prey on the local fauna, but anakores don’t mind
attacking sapient travellers, and judging from what the book says seem to prefer
it. They don’t have any visible sexual dimorphism, and rumor has it that they
reproduce by dragging some of their sapient victims to weird cocoons under the
sands. There, the victims are transformed into more anakores. No one knows what
criteria they use to select new candidates.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Anakores are Medium Aberrant Humanoids, which means they’re sapient. They have
low-light vision and Tremorsense 5, plus a ground speed of 5 with Earth Walk and
a burrow speed of 6 on loose earth only. They communicate in Deep Speech.</p>

<p>Their signature traits are <strong>Dune Diver</strong>, which lets them charge while
burrowing, and <strong>Sensitive to Light</strong>, which gives them a -2 penalty to attacks
for a turn when they’re exposed to direct sunlight or take radiant damage.</p>

<p>Their poison is a rider on a different attack on every stat block, but the
effect is always the same: the target is slowed on a hit (save ends), worsening
to immobilized (save ends) after the first failed save.</p>

<h3 id="anakore-hunter">Anakore Hunter</h3>

<p>These are the ones who drag people under. They’re Level 5 Lurkers with 48
HP. Their basic <strong>claw</strong> attacks grab the target on a hit, and on their next
turn they can choose to either bite the victim or drag them under.</p>

<p>The <strong>bite</strong> targets a grabbed creature and deals a bit less damage than the
claws, but applies the poison described above. <strong>Drag Under</strong> (melee 1
vs. Fortitude) can target either immobilized or grabbed creatures. It deals more
damage than the claw, inflicts 5 ongoing damage and removes the target from play
(save ends both). When the effect ends the target reappears at its previous
position or on the closest unoccupied square. And even them they’re still
immobilized (save ends), so the hunter can try to drag them under again right
away instead of having to bite.</p>

<p>Presumably, victims who drop to 0 HP by this attack would be dragged further
down and not come back up. Don’t let that happen!</p>

<h3 id="anakore-render">Anakore Render</h3>

<p>This is the one that hurts the prey and makes it more vulnerable to the
others. Renders are Level 7 Brutes with 96 HP and a ground speed of 7 instead
of the usual 5.</p>

<p>Their <strong>claws</strong> do heavy damage on a hit, pushing the target 2 squares and
knocking it prone. Their <strong>blood frenzy</strong> ablity (recharge 5+) lets them perform
two of these attacks in one action.</p>

<p>As a move action, they can use <strong>Blood Hunger</strong> to shift 3 squares closer to a
bloodied creature. As a minor action, they can use a <strong>rending bite</strong> against a
prone or bloodied creature, which does light physical damage and applies anakore
venom.</p>

<h3 id="anakore-dune-king">Anakore Dune King</h3>

<p>Often the leaders of a pack, Dune Kings signal the start of an attack by
bursting up from the ground in the middle of their targets and distracting them
so their fellows can attack the victims more safely. They’re Level 9 Skirmishers
with 94 HP and the Leader tag.</p>

<p>Their <strong>claws</strong> damage and apply anakore poison on a hit, but the real threat
here is the <strong>Sand Eruption</strong> ability (recharge 5+). The dune king must be
underground to start this, and the action lets him move 4 squares to a square
that’s not underground. The first time they enter such a square, they can
perform a Close Burst 2 attack that targets enemies and deals very heavy
physical damage on a hit, sliding the targets 2 squares. Additionally, each
anakore in the burst can shift 3 squares as a free action, and the area of the
burst becomes difficult terrain until the end of the encounter.</p>

<p>Finally, Dune Kings can shift 1 square as a minor action using <strong>Sand Slide</strong>,
which makes them as slippery as kobolds despite their size.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Anakore bands only hunt in places where they can burrow, which means the terrain
on the map will mostly be soft earth, sand, or silt. An anakore-only encounter
is the most common one, I think, but they can also appear with other burrowing
predators that they either trained, or which happen to be opportunistically
hanging around.</p>

<p>They can also work with other sapients that pay them in food and trinkets for
doing what they were already going to do anyway, and you might also find them
in bizarre aberrant ruins on or under the surface, drawn there by strange dreams
and performing unspeakable rituals.</p>

<p>Anakores are smart enough to recognize when they’re in a poor situation, and
when they should negotiate instead of fighting. But if they think they should
fight, their underground ambushes can be pretty terrifying, as all of their
powers synergize very well and make the tactics described in the lore section
very effective.</p>

<p>Their burrow speed lets them go back underground at will, meaning each Dune King
might be able to perform more than one Sand Eruption in a fight, and the Hunters
can move with relative impunity among the party to harass and grab the
PCs. Renders stay up top once they emerge, and all of them are immune to the
difficult terrain created by the Kings due to Earth Walk.</p>
