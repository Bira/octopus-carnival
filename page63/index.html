            <p>The first Monster Manual and the Monster Vault contained plenty of giants, whose
lore in 4e is pretty awesome. I covered their basic lore <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/30/giants.html">here</a>, and also had
individual posts for <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/01/earth-giants.html">hill</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/04/frost-giants.html">frost</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/06/fire-giants.html">fire</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/07/death-giants.html">death</a> and <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/10/storm-giants.html">storm</a>
giants.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual 2 added more giants, and it’s actually where Frost Giants
made their first appearance in this edition. We already covered them in the
corresponding post linked above. In this one, we’ll cover the two other
varieties introduced in the same entry: Eldritch and Stone giants. The latter
are old standbys, and I had never heard of the former until now. If they existed
in a previous edition, it was in one of the more out-of-the-way supplements or
Dragon articles for 3e.</p>

<h2 id="eldritch-giants">Eldritch Giants</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the basic lore post, the primordials made the first Giants from
the same elements they used in the world, to help them shape and understand
it. Well, it turns out <em>raw magic</em> is as much a basic building block of the
world as the more classical elements of earth, fire, air, and water. Therefore,
it got its own Giant type.</p>

<p>Eldritch giants were among the most powerful creations of the Primordials, and
they helped a lot with shaping the flow of magical energies in the still-cooling
world. Today their power is much diminished from what it was at the dawn of
time, and most of them dedicate their lives to accumulating magical power and
knowledge in hopes of returning to those lofty heights.</p>

<p>Both eldritch giants and titans are still well-versed in magic. They know how to
form weapons out of pure force, and they tattoo their bodies with symbols that
allow them to absorb the magic of others and teleport at will. They live near
sources of arcane power, and jealously hoard knowledge and artifacts. Eldritch
giant social hierarchy is based on how much power individuals managed to
accumulate - Eldritch Titans tend to be at the top. An individual eldritch giant
or titan might have more abilities than what is depicted in the “typical” stat
blocks of this entry, and they’ll certainly have access to lots and lots of
magic rituals.</p>

<p>Most interactions between mortals and eldritch giants as written here are likely
to be hostile, since the giants don’t have much reason to be friendly. They love
binding and enslaving other creatures with magic, though, so they might be
encountered alongside powerful elementals, slaads, and other such creatures. A
more reasonable group of them would make valuable allies against powerful
incorporeal enemies, though, since they specialize in force magic.</p>

<h3 id="eldritch-giant">Eldritch Giant</h3>

<p>“Standard” eldritch giants are Large Fey Humanoids with the “giant”
keyword, and Level 18 Skirmishers with 171 HP. They have low-light vision, 10
force resistance, and a +5 bonus to saves vs. charm effects. Their ground speed
is 8 and they also have a teleport speed of 6.</p>

<p>These giants fight in melee with Reach 2 <strong>Eldritch Blades</strong> that target Reflex
and deal force damage, and at range with Range 20 <strong>Force Missiles</strong> that do the
same. Being so large, they can also use <strong>Sweeping Sword</strong> attacks to target
everyone in a Close Blast 2 instead of a single victim, and they can do that
even when charging.</p>

<p>As a minor action, they can deploy an <strong>Eldritch Field</strong> (close blast 5; recharge
5+) that counts as difficult terrain and makes enemies inside take extra damage
from the their attacks. Also as a minor action, they can use <strong>Consume Magic</strong>
to absorb a magic zone created by a PC. This requires them to hit the caster’s
Will with an attack, and if they succeed their own attacks get a big damage
boost until the end of their next turn.</p>

<h3 id="eldritch-titan">Eldritch Titan</h3>

<p>Eldritch Titans are Huge, and Level 21 Elite Skirmishers with 394 HP. They have
the same passive traits as their smaller cousins.</p>

<p>Their Reach 3 <strong>Eldritch Hammers</strong> deal more damage, and they can make two
attacks per action, even on a charge. Their ranged force attack is also stronger
and pushes the target 5 squares on a hit.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can cast a <strong>Force Hammer</strong> that damages everyone on a
close blast 3, pushes then 3 squares and knocks them prone. On a miss the
targets still take half damage and are pushed. They have the same Consume Magic
and Eldritch Field abilities as eldritch giants.</p>

<h2 id="stone-giants">Stone Giants</h2>

<p>The other type of classic earth giant, Stone Giants are among the most
reasonable people among all giantkind. They usually don’t care about raiding or
conquest, and just want to be left alone in their mountain homes. Discrete and
contemplative sorts, they can stay immobile for years while lost in thought, and
are surprisingly adept at hiding themselves in their home terrain.</p>

<p>Someone passing throug stone giant territory might never spot them at all, and
ill-intentioned travelers might find themselves ambushed before they can do any
harm. The exception to all of this is when the giants are feeling rowdy and want
to have some fun: their favorite game is basically dodgeball with enormous
boulders, and when they’re in the middle of it they don’t usually pay attention
to any smaller creatures who might be in the path of those boulders.</p>

<p>Stone giants are one of the few Giants who are actually on friendly terms with
communities of galeb duhrs and azers. They have a long and proud tradition of
stone carving, and their magic is based on carved runes. It’s possible the
dwarves originally learned their own rune-magic from stone giants, though modern
dwarf scholars dispute this notion.</p>

<p>Friendly giants of other types, unable to stand their generally unpleasant
societies, often move in with stone giants. Conversely, evil stone giants tend
to move out of their ancestral homes and throw their lot with their more
villainous relatives.</p>

<h3 id="stone-giant">Stone Giant</h3>

</figure>

<p>Stone Giants are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Earth and Giant
keywords. They’re Level 14 Soldiers with 140 HP, immune to petrification, and
have a ground speed of 8 with Earth Walk. This lets them ignore difficult
terrain with a “geological” origin.</p>

<p>They use giant-sized <strong>stone greatclubs</strong>. As usual for soldiers, their basic
attacks mark on a hit and they can make opportunity attacks marked creatures in
reach that move or shift. They can also make a <strong>Staggering Sweep</strong> that works
like an area attack, pushes targets 2 squares, and marks them. At range, they
can <strong>hurl rocks</strong> like you’d expect out of an old-school giant.</p>

<p>While they’re unbloodied, they can use <strong>Stone Bones</strong> as an interrupt when hit
by an attack, gaining 5 resistance do its damage.</p>

<h3 id="stone-giant-runecarver">Stone Giant Runecarver</h3>

<p>This spellcaster is a Level 16 Controller with 155 HP and the Leader
keyword. Their magic is partly about slowing and immobilizing enemies, and
partly about doing unpleasant things to enemies suffering from those conditions.</p>

<p>They fight in melee with <strong>Enruned Picks</strong>, which are High-Crit weapons and have
a slow (save ends) rider. <strong>Grasping Stone</strong> ensures that any enemy slowed by
the giant is also immobilized for a turn.</p>

<p>Magic-wise, their <strong>Rune of Thundering Echo</strong> (recharge 5+) deals thunder damage
over an area and inflicts ongoing thunder damage (save ends) on targets who are
slowed or immobilized. The <strong>Rune of Stony Sleep</strong> (recharge 6+) affects a
similar area, deals physical damage and slows (save ends). After the first
failed save, slowed enemies become petrified instead (save still ends). That
rune also creates a zone within its affected area that inflicts a -2 penalty
against saves vs. slowness or immobilization effects.</p>

<p>“Save ends” petrification might not sound so bad, but runecarvers also have a
<strong>Hardened Focus</strong> aura (5) that makes all petrified enemies inside lose any
damage resistance they have <em>and</em> gain Vulnerable 5 to all damage. An evil
runecarver is a good counter to a group of PCs who thought a fight against frost
or fire giants was going to be easy just because they packed the right elemental
resistances.</p>

<h3 id="stone-titan">Stone Titan</h3>

<p>Stone Titans are basically Stone Giants Plus, being Huge in size and Level 18
Elite Soldiers with 348 HP. They fight unarmed and throw rocks, but there are
some important differences.</p>

<p>First, their marking ability is a <strong>Slipstone Distortion</strong> aura (1) that marks
any enemy who starts their turn inside. Their <strong>slams</strong> deal extra damage to
marked enemies, and they can make opportunity attacks against marked enemies
like stone giants can.</p>

<p>Second, they can use an <strong>Avalanche Stomp</strong> (encounter) to attack everyone in a
Close Burst 3, with a hit doing heavy damage and causing the very earth to grab
the targets. The escape DC is 28, and the giant doesn’t need to spend actions to
sustain the grab. A miss still does half damage.</p>

<p>And third, they can “charge” a thrown rock and turn it into a <strong>Quakestone</strong>
(recharge 5+), making it into an area attack that does light damage, knocks
prone, and dazes (save ends) on a hit. A miss does half damage and knocks prone
without the daze.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Eldritch giants have a somewhat unusual name and appearance when compared to the
traditional types, but they’re a lot closer to them than it seems at first. I
guess calling them “Force Giants” would have been a little too on the nose, but
this is basically what they are. They use Force attacks in the same way a frost
giant would use Cold, or a fire giant would use Fire. Their fighting style is
similar, aside from the “I eat magic!” thing.</p>

<p>Stone giants on the other hand are one of the traditional types that have been
there since the beginning. I’m happy to see them here because your average stone
giant fits the “Earth Giant” mold a lot more readily than a hill giant, who’s
just a big human-looking person. I also like that the book doesn’t consider all
of them evil, and even mentioned that they partner up with non-evil individuals
of the other giant types. I often ponder how to make sapient monsters less evil
and hostile when I discuss them, so it’s nice to see an entry that does that as
written.</p>

<p>The first Monster Manual already includes a bunch of <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/18/ghost.html">ghosts</a>, and it even
has a basic Phantom Warrior. Here we have a more specific implementation of that
concept.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These creatures are the ghosts of soldiers who died in battle more or less at
the same time as the entire rest of their units. The emotional bonds between
them and the trauma of their violent massed deaths causes their spirits to fuse
and to rise as undead.</p>

<p>Legionnaires always appear as a unit, and they look like individuals acting in
concert, but they’re all part of the same collective ghost. So it might have
been more accurate to title this entry “Ghost <em>Legion</em>”. Members of the legion
can possess the living and make them experience the soldiers’ last moments.</p>

<p>When a ghost legionnaire is damaged, it always displays the wounds it suffered
in its final battle rather than the ones that were actually inflicted on it. So
a squad killed by some wizard’s acid-infused fireball would grow progressively
more burned and melted as the PC paladin stabs them.</p>

<p>A ghost legion might be endlessly reliving its last battle when found, seeing
any living intruders as their enemies. It might also be following the orders of
a more powerful undead being, particularly if that being was one of its
commanders in life.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>An individual legionnaire is a Medium Natural Humanoid with the Undead keyword,
and a Level 13 Soldier with 100 HP. Despite being a ghost, it’s not considered
insubstantial, but it has 10 necrotic resistance and isn’t especially vulnerable
to radiant damage.</p>

<p>Legionnaires fight with the same weapons they had in life, making <strong>devastating
cuts</strong> with their melee weapons or shooting <strong>ghost arrows</strong> that do necrotic
damage. They can also use their <strong>Battle Visions</strong> power to possess a
target. This has range 20, targets Will and deals psychic damage with a Dominate
(save ends) rider. While the target is dominated, the ghost is removed from the
map. When the target finally makes their save, the ghost reappears in an
adjacent space.</p>

<p>This ghost’s main weakness takes the form of a trait named <strong>Call to
History</strong>. It allows a PC to make a DC 25 History check as a minor action to
recall details about the legionnaire’s original unit. A success here makes the
PC’s next attack against that ghost deal 10 extra damage. I don’t think you can
stack multiple checks in a single attack, but you <em>can</em> make a check every turn
before you attack. Someone who was possessed and made their save has a +5 bonus
to these tests for the rest of the fight, as those horrifying battle visions act
as extra reference material.</p>

<p>The collective nature of a ghost legion is expressed by the <strong>Soul Link</strong>
trait. Basically, you combine the HP totals of all legionnaires present in the
fight into a single pool. Damage to any individual legionnaire is subtracted
from this combined pool. The whole unit is destroyed when this pool is reduced
to 0, but until that happens all legionnaires remain in the fight! This makes
the usual “focus fire” strategy considerably less effective against them.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 15, and quite straightforward: a 5-ghost unit and
a human lich wizard from the MM. A Nerathi squad plus their former commanding
officer.</p>

<p>I really like the “collective HP” gimmick! It shouldn’t be too hard to add or
subtract levels from the stat block given here, either, meaning you can bring
the Fun (TM) of ghost legions to the party no matter what their
level.</p>

<p>There isn’t much of a story difference between a ghost legionnaire and a phantom
warrior, as you can see by their names. This suggests that one way to get a
level 4 legionnaire would be to remove Insubstantial from the warrior and add
Soul Link in its place. You can likely do the same with any other thesaurus
buddies that might come along (banshee battlers, figment fighters, spectral
soldiers, wraith warriors…).</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/08/26/genasi.html">Let&#39;s Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Genasi</a>

<p>The concept of “people touched by the elements” is a 3e thing, but genasi as
presented in Fourth Edition are slightly different than what came before
them. They debuted in the Forgotten Realm Player’s Guide as a playable option,
and would later appear in the MM2 in “monster” format.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In previous editions genasi were humans with “genie blood”, but in Fourth
they’re simply humanoid sapients from the Elemental Chaos. They’re given no
cosmically significant origin story like tieflings or daeva, so I must assume
they simply evolved naturally in that plane.</p>

<p>Genasi look more or less human and have human proportions, but each of them also
has an <em>elemental manifestation</em>. The five known manifestations are “firesoul”,
“watersoul”, “windsoul”, “stormsoul”, and “earthsoul”. Each genasi is born with
one of these and an individual’s manifestation has more to do with their
environment than with genetics. A genasi community built inside a volcano is
going to have a lot of firesouls, and so on.</p>

<p>A genasi’s manifestation accents their physical appearance and defines some of
their inborn powers and resistances. It’s an always active part of their being,
not something they can turn off. Some of them train to acquire additional
manifestations. PCs can have two at most, but some NPCs can have more.</p>

<p>Genasi live primarily in the Elemental Chaos. They have an easier time of it
than most other mortals but still must step lightly around efreeti and the
like. They can also be found in the world or in the Feywild, since they don’t
have any more difficulty living there than a human would.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Genasi are Medium Elemental Humanoids, with a ground speed of 6. They tend to
have keywords corresponding to their elemental manifestations: a fire genasi
will have the Fire keyword, and so on. Their manifestation also determines what
elements they are resistant to, if any, and the themes of their powers. What
those powers are is mostly a function of training, so varies per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="genasi-elemental-dervish">Genasi Elemental Dervish</h3>

<p>“I’m the Avatar, and you’re gonna have to deal with it!” This is a genasi
warrior who has learned to manifest multiple elements, and trained extensively
with the double sword. They can move equally well on the ground, in the water,
or in the air. Their sword attacks can cause several different types of
elemental damage, as can their magic.</p>

<p>Elemental dervishes are Level 18 Elite Controllers with 344 HP and keywords for
the four “classic” elements (air, earth, fire, water). They have ground, swim,
and fly speeds of 6, and 10 resistance to cold, fire, and lightning damage.</p>

<p>At the start of its turn, the Dervish chooses an between fire, lightning and
thunder. Their <strong>double sword</strong> attacks will deal both immediate and ongoing
damage of that type. They can make two of those per action, being elites.</p>

<p>When a dervish is hit by an adjacent enemy, it can use its reaction to respond
with a <strong>Fiery Riposte</strong>, which targets Reflex and inflicts 10 ongoing fire
damage (save ends). If the enemy was already on fire, their existing ongoing
fire damage increases by 10 instead.</p>

<p>Their special attack is <strong>Primordial Storm</strong> (recharge 5+), which allows them to
shift 6 squares and perform three attacks in order against different targets at
any point along the movement. The first is <strong>Promise of Storm</strong>, which deals
thunder damage and makes the target Vulnerable 5 to thunder (save ends). The
second is <strong>Earth Shock</strong>, which deals physical damage and stuns for a turn. The
third and last one is <strong>Lightning Cut</strong>, which deals lightning damage and
inflicts 10 ongoing lightning damage.</p>

<p>The elemental dervish is flashy and awesome, and given enough time or
well-selected comrades they can set up some interesting elemental damage combos.</p>

<h3 id="genasi-fireblade">Genasi Fireblade</h3>

<p>A very straightfoward hot-headed warrior who charges into combat with a flaming
falchion. It’s a Level 11 Brute with 139 HP.</p>

<p>The <strong>falchion</strong> it wields is a High-Crit weapon and inflicts ongoing fire
damage. It has the same Fiery Riposte as the dervish, dealing 5 ongoing damage
instead of 10. Its other power is <strong>Fan The Flames</strong> (Close Burst 1 vs. Reflex;
recharge 5+), which sets people on fire and gives them a -2 penalty to saves
against ongoing fire damage.</p>

<p>Fireblades are going to charge into combat, Fan the Flames, and then get to work
on cutting people up and setting them on fire at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="genasy-hydromancer">Genasy Hydromancer</h3>

<p>AKA, a waterbender that’s also partially made of water. This Level 8 Controller
has 91 HP, a swim speed of 8, and fights with a high-crit <strong>Scimitar</strong> and lots
of water powers.</p>

<p>The basic <strong>Wave Bolt</strong> (ranged 5) deals physical damage and slides targets 3
squares; <strong>Whirling Vortex</strong> (recharge 5+) does the same in a burst around the
hydromancer that affects only enemies; <strong>Drowning Touch</strong> inflicts ongoing
damage on a single target (save ends), but only recharges once the target saves
or drops to 0 HP.</p>

<p>The “partially made of water” bit is expressed by two other abilities: <strong>Liquid
Body</strong> is a reaction that allows them to take half damage from the triggering
attack, and <strong>Swift Current</strong> (encounter) allows them to shift their speed with
the ability to move through enemy spaces and basically ignore all terrain
effects while doing so.</p>

<h3 id="genasi-skyspy">Genasi Skyspy</h3>

<p>A windsoul genasi that fights with paired shortswords and uses their mobility
powers to enhance their hit and run tactics. They’re a Level 7 Skirmisher with
78 HP and 5 cold resistance.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>short sword</strong> attack allows them to shift 1 square on a hit, and
they can make two of those against an opponent granting them combat
advantage. <strong>Feather-Footed</strong> gives them an AC bonus against opportunity
attacks, and <strong>Sky Jaunt</strong> (recharge 4+) allows them to fly until the end of
their current turn.</p>

<p>Should the PCs manage to surround the skyspy, the genasi can use <strong>Manifest
Whirlwind</strong> (close burst 2; encounter) to do some damage, push them 1 square,
and knock them prone. This should help clear some space.</p>

<h3 id="genasi-stoneshield">Genasi Stoneshield</h3>

<p>A heavily armored earthsoul warrior wielding a heavy pick in battle. It’s a
Level 10 Soldier with 106 HP. Stoneshields are difficult to push around - any
forced movement applied to them is reduced by 1 square.</p>

<p>The <strong>war pick</strong> is a High Crit weapon, and it also marks on a hit. This mark is
remarkable for being (save ends) instead of only lasting a turn. Marked targets
take a -5 penalty to damage against the stoneshield’s allies. They can also
attack with a <strong>Mighty Bull Rush</strong> that does the same damage as the pick and
pushes the target 1 square. It also allows the stoneshield to move into the
target’s previous position.</p>

<p>Finally, they can stomp really hard and cause a non-damaging <strong>Earth Shock</strong>
(minor action; encounter) that covers a Close Burst 2 and knocks enemies prone
on a hit.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Genasi can be found alongside a large variety of other creatures, particularly
elementals. They’re as morally varied as humans, so a villain could certainly
employ genasi henchpeople. We have three example encounters here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 3 genasi skyspies riding hipogriff dreadmounts, accompanied by their
pet shardstorm vortex elemental.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 2 fireblades, 2 stoneshields, and a trained magma strider.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 19: Two storm archons (a squallshield and a tempest weaver) and two
elemental dervish mercs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Reading about genasi doesn’t give me the sort of instant adventure inspiration
that some of the other monsters do, but I like that they exist. Their presence
in the Elemental Chaos gives you an excuse to place “normal everyday
communities” in that plane for your PCs to interact with. Not every EC
settlement is a githzerai monastery or the City of Brass.</p>

            <p>Fomorians first appeared in the first Monster Manual, and we covered them
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/07/fomorian.html">here</a>. This entry gives us more fomorian stat blocks, and a few more bits of
lore.</p>

<p>First, we have a bit of general lore, which is really a logical extension of the
fact that Fomorians believe themselves the most important creatures in the
universe. They hate all other fey, but that hate manifests as a desire to
subjugate rather than exterminate them. Their perfect world is one where
fomorians rule absolute over the Feywild and have all its other inhabitants
forever toiling to please their masters.</p>

<p>Because of this obsession, fomorians are eternally at war with the other fey
civilizations. It’s likely they’ll never succeed in conquering all of the
Feywild, but they’ll never stop trying either. I suppose there must also be some
level of internecine strife among them, because it seems to be they’re very
likely to fight over who gets to be supreme ruler.</p>

<p>The remaining bits of lore concern the individual stat blocks here, and so will
be covered in those stat blocks.</p>

<p>Numbers-wise, fomorians still retain their common traits from the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/07/fomorian.html">first
article</a>: they’re Huge Fey Humanoids with the Giant keyword; they’re
extremely perceptive (trained Perception, Truesight 6); and they have some sort
of “evil eye” ability that varies per stat block.</p>

<h2 id="fomorian-ghost-shaman">Fomorian Ghost Shaman</h2>

<p>Ghost shamans are necromancers who enslave the spirits of those they kill. They
command these spirits as if they were puppets, enacting sadistic plays for their
own amusement. They also use enslaved spirits as weapons in combat.</p>

<p>Ghost shamans are Level 16 Elite Controllers with 312 HP. They have darkvision
in addition to the other fomorian traits. All of their attacks are magical in
nature and, except for the Evil Eye, target Fortitude. Their basic melee attack
is <strong>Death’s Touch</strong>, which deals necrotic damage and slows (save ends). Their
<strong>Evil Eye</strong> is a minor-action ranged attack that inflicts ongoing necrotic
damage (save ends).</p>

<p>At will, they can use <strong>Spirits of Possession</strong> (close blast 3), which targets
people taking ongoing necrotic damage and dominates them on a hit (save ends). A
bit less often they can use <strong>Darksoul Mist</strong>, which is like a necrotic fireball
that leaves a zone of darkness in the affected area. This blocks line of sight
for anyone without darkvision.</p>

<h2 id="fomorian-cackler">Fomorian Cackler</h2>

<p>Cacklers are sly but unhinged assassins who get their name because they
constantly laugh a disturbing laugh. They can be silent when they want to be,
though, and are amazingly stealthy for someone the size of a house. They can
also use magic to shrink down to Medium size, which helps a lot.</p>

<p>Cacklers are also excellent at disguising themselves, since their minds can
easily construct entire fake personalities to aid in that. It’s possible for
previously discarded personalities to momentarily come to the fore again,
though, which is part of why they’re so unstable.</p>

<p>They fight with <strong>daggers</strong> bigger than the average human greatsword, which they
can use in melee or throw out to range 10. The thrown dagger attack can target
one or two enemies, and they return after it resolves.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Evil Eye</strong> makes them invisible to the affected enemy, and they get a
big bonus to damage against targets that can’t see them. <strong>Size Alteration</strong>
lets them switch between Huge and Medium as a minor action.</p>

<h2 id="fomorian-totemist">Fomorian Totemist</h2>

<figure class="center">

<p>Totemists are fomorian spellcasters that collect the heads of those they kill
and build chains out of them. Each head in the chain is imbued with necromantic
power, and can channel a different curse. Most totemists have a preference for a
particular type of head - one might favor eladrin heads, another dwarves, and so
on. Some of them select prospective additions to their chains year in advance,
following the lives of their future victims until the time is right for the
“harvest”.</p>

<p>Totemists are Level 18 Elite Skirmishers with 352 HP. They fight with the
afore-mentioned <strong>Chain of Heads</strong>, which is Reach 4, does physical damage and
inflicts ongoing necrotic damage. They can also channel curses through the chain
as a minor action, with an ability with the very unfortunate name of
<strong>Voodoo</strong>. There are three possible effects: the <strong>Glorious Head</strong> blinds, the
<strong>Wasting Head</strong> weakens, and the <strong>Bewildering Head</strong> forces the target to make
a melee basic attack against an ally in reach. After attacking, the totemist can
shift 1 square.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Evil Eye</strong> does light necrotic damage and inflicts a -2 penalty to
saves, which helps that blindness or weakness last longer. And finally we have
<strong>Fresh Rage</strong>, a passive trait that makes their first succesfful attack in
their turn deal extra damage.</p>

<h2 id="fomorian-blinder">Fomorian Blinder</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-fomorian-blinder.png"/>

</figure>

<p>Blinders have more specialized and discerning tastes than totemists. They
collect <em>eyes</em> instead of lugging whole heads around. Blinders are the scholars
and sages of fomorian-kind, acting as repositories of their civilization’s
lore. They’re also very good at eye-based magic - if anyone knows how to make a
defense against the Evil Eye, it’s them.</p>

<p>Blinders are Level 20 Elite Artillery with 296 HP. They use <strong>quarterstaffs</strong>
for melee combat but their forte is eye magic. <strong>Acid Eye</strong> is a ranged attack
that deals acid and necrotic damage, and whose enervating properties prevent the
use of encounter or daily powers for a turn. <strong>Shower of Ichor</strong> (encounter)
deals the same damage over a wider area, and also inflicts ongoing acid and
necrotic damage.</p>

<p>The blinder’s actual <strong>Evil Eye</strong> is quite powerful: it does no damage by
itself, but someone cursed by it will take the same damage the fomorian inflicts
on other enemies with their other attacks. It ends when the victim saves
successfully, or when the fomorian uses this on someone else.</p>

<p>Ironically, blinders have no abilities that actually blind people.</p>

<h2 id="fomorian-butcher">Fomorian Butcher</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-fomorian-butcher.png"/>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Butchers are big fomorians with big blades who like to cut people up for
fun. Such simplicity is a bit disappointing after we saw all those esoterically
evil fomorian casters and assassins, but they’re still very dangerous and just
as ambitious. In fact, they go to absurd lengths to fulfill their serial-killer
urges, and will often trade their souls to devils and make other dangerous deals
in exchange for more power.</p>

<p>Butchers are Level 22 Elite Brutes with 514 HP. They use titan-sized
<strong>falchions</strong>, which are High-Crit weapons. They’re all about focusing on a
single victim and hacking them apart with repeated strikes: when they score a
critical, they can make another free attack with the falchion against the same
victim, and their attacks deal a bunch of extra damage against a victim they
already hit earlier in the same turn. Their <strong>Evil Eye</strong> restrains (save ends).</p>

<p>There are several ways they can get that extra damage from a “subsequent” hit:
the bonus attack from a critical, spending an action point to attack again, and
I’d say hitting with the Evil Eye also counts for this. So they’ll always try
that before swinging their blades.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Most of the sample encounters here are “Assorted Fomorians” from this book and
the MM. One of them also involves drow and Lolthbound Goblins. Generally
speaking you can also frequently find fomorians accompanied by cyclops slaves,
or by other evil fey they’ve enslaved or allied with. Devils could also make an
appearance, since it seems Fomorian diabolists are somewhat common.</p>

<p>This lot is quite a bit more flavorful than the fomorians in the MM, and the
extra lore does justice to the basics laid down by the first book. “Voodoo” is a
very unfortunate name for an ability, but it’s easy enough to change.</p>
