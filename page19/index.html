<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Gnomes were introduced as a playable race in the days of AD&amp;D, where they had a
niche as the nonhuman illusionists and were otherwise slightly smaller
dwarves. The removal of class and level restrictions in 3.x turned them into one
of the least popular race choices in the game in my experience. If you wanted to
play a short angry person you played a dwarf; if you wanted a short cute person
you played a halfling; and if you wanted a non-human wizard you played an elf.</p>

<p>This might have been one of the factors that kept them out of the PHB when 4e
was released, replaced by tieflings. They would eventually appear on the PHB 2,
but until then the only gnome stats we got were in the first Monster Manual.</p>

<p>This switch was announced in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UqFPujRZWo">one of the funniest pieces of D&amp;D marketing
ever</a> before the PHB had been even published, which had the unfortunate side
effect of turning every edition warrior into a campaigner for gnome rights until
the publication of the PHB 2.</p>

<p>Gnomes appear both in the MM and in the MV. Interestingly, if you’re going
Essentials-only gnomes once again drop from the list of playable races and
appear only in the monster book.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Gnomes don’t exist, or so they would have you believe. This diminutive fey
people endured a long period of slavery at the hands of the fomorians, but were
able to escape with the (unwitting, according to some legends) help of the
eladrin. They kinda compete with eladrin for the title of “most fey playable
race”, as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>Since that remote past, they’ve spread all over the Feywild and the world,
though few know it. Gnome culture values cunning and discretion, since it
developed in a hostile environment full of much larger creatures bent on hunting
them. Gnome communities are extremely well-hidden, even when they’re located
within large human cities. In that case, gnomes might build their homes between
the walls of neighboring buildings or under their floors, wainscot-fantasy style.</p>

<p>Their interpersonal relations are similarly camouflaged. The typical gnome is
suspicious of strangers and very slow to trust, but hides that behind a mask of
pleasantness and even frivolity. In the worst case, this suspicion can sour into
paranoia and lead a gnome down the path of evil. Some of them even work as spies
and assassins for the fomorians.</p>

<p>A large percentage of gnomes train in magic, becoming wizards or warlocks and
focusing on illusions. Even a gnome untrained in magic can turn invisible.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gnomes are Small Fey Humanoids with a typical speed of 5 and low-light
vision. They have two signature traits: Fade Away is an encounter power that
allows them to turn invisible for a turn or until they attack, and Reactive
Stealth allows them to make a Stealth check to become hidden when they roll
initiative, if they have any degree of cover or concealment at that point. The
MV gnomes frequently trade those for improved powers along the same line.</p>

<p>All the gnomes we see in these books are Unaligned, as is traditional for PC or
PC-adjacent peoples. They could be used as enemies or allies depending on the
story. Let’s look at them in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-skulk-mm">Gnome Skulk (MM)</h3>

<p>This Level 2 Lurker has 34 HP and all common traits, including both powers. It
wields a war pick and a hand crossbow, and wears leather.</p>

<p>The basic pick attack has the High Crit property, and the skulk deals an extra
1d6 damage on any attack where it has combat advantage. If it attacks from
hiding and misses, the gnome skulk remains hidden.</p>

<p>Your basic rogue-type, with a few additional tricks that give it the ability to
keep hidden for longer.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-arcanist-mm">Gnome Arcanist (MM)</h3>

<p>One of those magically-trained gnomes. This is a Level 3 Controller with 46 HP
and all common traits including the two powers. It projects a 5-square Aura of
Illusion that grants concealment to itself and all allies within. The arcanist
wields a pitifully weak dagger as a basic attack and relies on ranged spells for
actual fighting.</p>

<p>Its main ranged attack is a Scintillating Bolt (Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) which
does radiant damage and dazes (save ends). As a minor action it can also fire
off a Startling Glamor (Ranged 10 vs. Will) that does no damage and slides the
target 1 square. It can also cast Illusory Terrain (Close Burst 5 vs. Will),
which does no damage and slows all enemies in the area.</p>

<p>In addition to the already-mentioned gnome racial powers, the arcanist also
borrows the Eladrin’s Fey Step.</p>

<p>Despite its low damage potential, the arcanist is still quite dangerous when
paired with other monsters that can fill that function. It has an at-will daze!</p>

<h3 id="gnome-spy-mv">Gnome Spy (MV)</h3>

<p>Basically a more powerful version of the MM Skulk, this gnome is a Level 5
Lurker with 51 HP, trained Perception, and all common gnome traits including the
two powers. It is, in fact the last gnome in this post to have those powers at
all.</p>

<p>The spy fights with a short sword in melee, and throws daggers out to
Range 10. Both do extra damage if the gnome is invisible to the target when it
attacks.</p>

<p>Aside from the reactive Fade Away power, the gnome spy can also turn invisible
for a turn or until it attacks as a standard action.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-illusionist-mv">Gnome Illusionist (MV)</h3>

<p>A more powerful gnome wizard, this one is Level 6 Artillery with 57 HP and all
common traits except for the powers. It’s also trained in Bluff and Stealth.</p>

<p>The illusionist’s weapon is a Gnarled Staff that’s nothing special in melee, but
likely acts as an implement for its spells. Bedazzle (Area Burst 1 within 10
vs. Will) is an at-will attack that does radiant damage and makes targets grant
combat advantage (save ends); See Me Not (Close Blast 3 vs. Will; recharge 5-6)
does psychic damage and makes the gnome invisible to the targets (save ends).</p>

<p>As a move-action encounter power the illusionist can use There, Not There, a
spell that teleports it 5 squares and creates two illusory doubles within 5
squares of the destination. These last until the original attacks or until they
are destroyed - they have 1 HP and the same defenses as the original. The
illusionist can use its actions to have them do anything it could, except use
powers.</p>

<p>As an at-will minor action the illusionist can disguise itself and 2 allies
within 5 squares as any Small or Medium creature. Seeing through the illusion
requires an opposed Insight check against the gnome’s Bluff.</p>

<h3 id="gnome-assassin-mv">Gnome Assassin (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 7 Skirmisher with 78 HP and all common traits except for the
powers. It wears leather and wields paired katars.</p>

<p>The katars are its basic attack, and do extra damage if the assassin attacks out
of Shade Form. Shade Form, in turn, is an encounter power that recharges when
the assassin is bloodied. It lasts for a turn or until it attacks. While this
power is active, the assassin is insubstantial, has Vulnerable 5 Radiant, and
can make Stealth checks to become hidden if it has any cover or concealment.</p>

<p>In addition to all this, the assassin can use Shadow Step as an at-will move
action, using its enemies’ shadows as portals. It teleports 3 squares to another
shadow and sheds any mark applied to it. It must start and end the teleport
adjacent to another creature, since it’s using their shadows for this.</p>

<p>You better keep your squishies far away from your defenders when fighting gnome
assassins (and hope they don’t appear near your squishies).</p>

<h3 id="gnome-entropist-mv">Gnome Entropist (MV)</h3>

<p>Our final gnome is another spellcaster, Level 8 Artillery with 71 HP and all
common traits except the powers.</p>

<p>Despite being a blasty mage, the Entropist is still skilled at illusion. Its
Illusory Defenses give it a +2 bonus against ranged attacks, and it upgrades the
standard Fade Away power to Disappearing Act, which lasts for a turn and
<em>doesn’t</em> end when the gnome attacks.</p>

<p>The entropist fights in melee with a Touch of Chaos that does acid damage, and
at range with an Entropic Arc (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex) that does physical damage
and prevents the target from taking immediate and opportunity actions for a
turn. Perfect to let a fellow skirmisher pop free from the PC fighter.</p>

<p>Its “special” attack is Chaos Flare (Area Burst 1 within 15 vs. Will) which
affects only enemies and recharges if it misses all targets. A hit does physical
damage and blinds (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter in the MM is level 3: 2 arcanists, 2 iron defenders
(low-level constructs) and a pseudodragon. They’re likely a guard patrol for one
of those hidden settlements, which is likely to be quite awkward for the humans
whose basement houses the main gate.</p>

<p>I like 4e’s take on gnomes as secretive fey tricksters, as it gives them a
distinctive flavor. It borrows a bit from Eberron, whose gnome nation of Zilargo
is the best at the great game of spying and intrigue in a setting already rife
with it. Pathfinder apparently went in a similar direction with its gnomes as
well, though theirs are less sneaky and more whimsical. This version of gnomes
survives in 5e as the “Forest Gnome” subrace.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Gnolls have been in the game since the beginning or close to it, when they fit
in the Humanoid Power Ladder right above hobgoblins and before bugbears. In 4e,
they are present in both books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Once the Humanoid Power Ladder got dismantled, just being “the 2 HD humanoid” no
longer cut it as the gnoll identity. And in Fourth Edition, they are now widely
known as the Least Reasonable Humanoids.</p>

<p>You see, the vast majority of these hyena-faced people your group ends up
fighting will be worshippers of the demon lord Yeenoghu, whose teachings can be
summed up as “kill and eat everything you see”. Gnoll bands are nomadic and roam
around fulfilling that mandate. They never build permanent structures, and even
their gear is mostly taken from those they killed. Sometimes they take slaves,
but those slaves never last long. Mostly they just kill and eat people. In
short, they’re the closest you can get to a demon while still having the natural
origin. You can frequently find actual demons in their midst, either summoned by
their priests or sent by Yeenoghu to boss them around. Their warriors carry all
sorts of demonic boons into battle as well.</p>

<p>No one else cooperates with gnolls. If you try they’ll eat you, and if you’re
strong enough to prevent them from eating you, you don’t need their help in the
first place.</p>

<p>There was a Dragon article with presented playable gnolls who were members of a
dissident faction that rejected demon worship. They are fierce and honorable
hunters, most often Good or Unaligned, and a lot more likely to cooperate with
others. I liked them a lot and I’m sad they never showed up again after that one
article.</p>

<p>The gnolls we’ll be looking at there are the usual “fanatical demon worshipper”
variety.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gnolls are Medium Natural Humanoids and typically Chaotic Evil. The gnoll
mechanical schtick is that they punch above their weight class. They get a +2
bonus to damage when bloodied, and their signature trait is Pack Attack, which
gives a further +5 damage bonus if their target has two or more of the
attacker’s allies next to it. Their land speed is 8, making it very hard for
innocent civilians to escape from them. And they have low-light vision, to
better chase you in the dark.</p>

<p>Unfortunately their MM incarnations suffer from the same “naturalistic design”
variant of the damage bug we saw with foulspawn. It’s less egregious due to
their lower level, but it does mean that a bloodied gnoll benefiting from Pack
Attack juuust manages to hit the average damage expected by the new math.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault variants behave like they’re supposed to, with their basic
damage hitting the expected average and the add-ons applying on top of
that. Don’t let them surround you!</p>

<p>There’s little overlap between the stat blocks in both books, which leaves us
with a lot of gnolls to look at. Fortunately most of them are fairly
simple. Let’s mix them all and look at them by level.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-huntmaster-both">Gnoll Huntmaster (Both)</h3>

<p>Huntmasters are level 5 artillery with 50 HP and all common gnoll traits. They
fight in melee with a handaxe, and at range with a longbow. Other than their
damage numbers, the two statblocks are identical.</p>

<p>The common traits are the entirety of huntmaster’s special tricks, which are
actually respectable since Pack Attack works with the longbow. The gnoll itself
doesn’t have to be adjacent to the target, only its allies!</p>

<h3 id="deathpledged-gnoll-mv">Deathpledged Gnoll (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 5 Brute has 75 HP and all common gnoll traits. It fights with a
spear, and generally wants to engage someone and stand its ground to both do
damage and give its buddies the benefit of Pack Attack.</p>

<p>This gnoll is “deathpledged” because when it first hits 0 HP, it goes berserk!
It regains 5 HP, gains Resist 15 All, and 1 action point! At the end of its next
turn, though, it drops dead. This means it’s going to use that last turn to
attack twice if you don’t manage to kill it first. This power is named Claws of
Yeenoghu.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-claw-fighter-mm">Gnoll Claw Fighter (MM)</h3>

<p>This Level 6 Skirmisher has 70 HP and likes to tear people apart with its bare
hands.</p>

<p>Its basic melee attack is a single claw strike, and it can make two of those
when it charges. It can also perform a Mobile Melee Attack that allows it to
make a claw strike and move a total of 4 squares at any point in the
action, without provoking opportunity attacks when moving away from the target
of the attack.</p>

<p>This gives us a pretty obvious routine: charge one turn, attack and move away on
the next. Fix the damage of the gnoll’s claws if you plan on using it, though,
it’s really low as printed.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-marauder-mm">Gnoll Marauder (MM)</h3>

<p>This Level 6 Brute has 84 HP and all common gnoll traits. It fights with a
spear, which makes me think it was an earlier version of the Deathpledged Gnoll
above.</p>

<p>Instead of the Claws of Yeenoghu power, the marauder has Quick Bite, which
allows it to make a free-action bite attack against a bloodied enemy it just hit
with the spear. This does a bit less damage than the spear, but it’s pretty good
for a bonus attack.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-blood-caller-mv">Gnoll Blood Caller (MV)</h3>

<p>Our first spellcaster is a Level 6 Soldier with 70 HP and all common gnoll
traits.</p>

<p>The blood caller fights with its claws, which mark for a turn as an effect. It
can follow that up with Blood Call (Close Burst 5 vs. Will), which targets every
enemy marked by the gnoll. A hit does psychic damage and pulls the target up to
3 squares. The gnoll itself can shift 3 squares as an effect, too.</p>

<p>Once the gnoll is bloodied it can use Blood Frenzy as a 1/round minor
action. This automatically deals a bit of damage to every enemy in a Close Burst
1 and marks them for a turn. And now you know why Blood Call is an area effect.</p>

<p>This is another monster that will make up the frontline in a gnoll encounter to
provide Pack Attack bonuses, and it has a few tricks to pull the PCs into more
favorable positions for that.</p>

<h3 id="fang-of-yeenoghu-mv">Fang of Yeenoghu (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 7 Skirmisher (Leader) has 77 HP and all common gnoll traits. It’s
another one of those caster-types.</p>

<p>The Fang of Yeenoghu wields a Cudgel of Bloody Teeth in combat, whose blows also
deal ongoing damage (save ends). Its other melee attack is a Relentless Push:
the gnoll can shift 2 squares before the attack, which does a bit less damage
than the basic cudgel blow and pushes the target 1 square. After this, one of
the gnoll’s allies within 5 squares can shift 1 square as a free action. I think
this is the most complicated gnoll power I’ve seen so far.</p>

<p>Its final technique is Howl of the Demon (Close Burst 5; Recharge 6), which
allows every ally in the burst to make a free melee basic attack.</p>

<p>It looks like the Fang’s main concern in a fight will be to position the PCs and
its allies so that all of them benefit from Pack Attack, and then let loose the
Howl.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-gorger-mv">Gnoll Gorger (MV)</h3>

<p>This most psychotic of gnolls is a Level 7 Brute with 96 HP and all common gnoll
traits. Its only attack is a bite that does Brute-tier damage, and as a minor
action it can Gorge, which means it takes a bite out of an ally. This deals 5
damage to the ally and heals the gorger for 5 HP.</p>

<p>That’s some real horrific imagery right there.</p>

<h3 id="demon-eye-gnoll-mv">Demon-Eye Gnoll (MV)</h3>

<p>This level 7 Lurker has 62 HP and all common traits. Plus, the Abyss leaks out
of its eyes.</p>

<p>This gnoll fights with a Reach 2 glaive, which does extra damage if the target
can’t see it. It has a Stare into the Abyss power (Close Burst 3 vs. Will) that
dazes and makes the gnoll invisible to the targets for a turn.</p>

<p>Once bloodied, the Abyss starts leaking through the gnoll’s wounds too,
functioning as an Aura 3 that deals psychic damage to those enemies caught
within and forces them to make a melee basic attack against an ally if they’re
dazed.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-demonic-scourge-mm">Gnoll Demonic Scourge (MM)</h3>

<p>This Level 8 Brute (Leader) has 106 HP and all common traits. It projects an
aura of command that gives a +1 attack bonus to allies within 5 squares, or +2
if the demonic scourge is bloodied.</p>

<p>It wields a heavy flail in combat, which can knock its targets prone if they’re
bloodied. And when it bloodies someone with the flail, an ally can make a free
melee basic attack against the target. Once per encounter, the gnoll can grant
this free attack to 2 allies instead of 1.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-far-fang-mv">Gnoll Far Fang (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 8 Artillery menace has 68 HP and is mostly an up-leveled version of
the huntmaster. It has one extra trick: a volley of Hungry Arrows (Area Burst 2
Within 10 vs. AC; Encounter) which does longbow damage plus ongoing damage (save
ends).</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-pack-lord-mv">Gnoll Pack Lord (MV)</h3>

<p>A Level 8 Controller (Leader) with 90 HP, this seems like a more complex version
of the demonic scourge above. It’s also pretty much a lazy warlord.</p>

<p>Its basic flail attack is nothing special, but it can cast a Demonic Frenzy
charm (Ranged 10 vs. Will) that does no damage, but dazes for a turn as an
<em>effect</em>. On a hit, it also inflicts a -2 attack penalty and forces the target
to make 2 basic attacks against targets of the gnoll’s choice.</p>

<p>It can also use a power called Feed on the Weak (Area Burst 1 within 5
vs. Will), which does no damage but causes the target to grant combat advantage
for a turn <em>and</em> allows an ally in the burst to make an attack as a free action.</p>

<p>As a minor action, it can use a Pack Cackle (Close Burst 5; recharge 5-6) to
allow its allies to shift 2 squares as a free action.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-demon-spawn-mv">Gnoll Demon Spawn (MV)</h3>

<p>Our final gnoll is a Level 9 Brute with 120 HP, who is Large but still a Natural
Humanoid despite that demonic ancestry. An upgraded version of the Gorger, it
fights with its claws and can take a bite out of its <em>enemies</em> to heal
itself. This is a minor action, and requires an attack roll since no PC is just
going to stand there and let it happen.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m not going to detail the MM encounters here, as this post is already too
long. You can guess what they look like: groups of assorted gnolls, with the
occasional pack of hyenas and evistro demons thrown in. As I said above, no one
else can work with these maniacs.</p>

<p>When it comes to humanoids and other “sapient, natural” opposition, I don’t mind
if the specific group the PCs are fighting is villainous. However it does bother
me a bit when the game seems to say every single member of the species is
similarly evil. That solitary Dragon article could have opened the way for a
setting where your typical gnoll is a person and not necessarily hostile, with
the ones you fight being those individuals who chose an evil path (much like the
game treats humans). Instead, it was never officially built upon and in fact 5e
went in the other direction and made gnolls into basically another type of
demon.</p>

<p>Anyway, these stat blocks make for mechanically interesting enemies and we have
enough of them to build entire dungeons with nothing but gnolls as the
opposition. Do grab that Dragon article if you can, I remember the playable
version was also quite good.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Githzerai were introduced into the game right alongside githyanki. They’re the
other side of the gith coin, the ninjas opposing the pirates. In the books we’re
covering, they only appear in the Monster Manual, but would also feature as a
playable character option in the Player’s Handbook 3.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Githzerai are an austere and contemplative people who follow a philosophy that
espouses discipline and mastery of the self. It might seem weird that they chose
to make their home in the Elemental Chaos, but they see withstanding the
turbulent nature of that plane as an important step on the road to
enlightenment.</p>

<p>Githzerai live in monasteries spread through the Elemental Chaos, where they
dedicate themselves to studying a martial arts style with a strong psionic
component. They use these arts to both defend themselves and to hunt down their
enemies - mainly mind flayers, which they understandably still hate.</p>

<p>Unlike the githyanki, the githzerai aren’t out to conquer the
multiverse. They’ll usually keep to themselves unless someone makes an effort to
rile them up. Like any other people they can produce their share of villains and
heroes, though.</p>

<p>The largest known githzerai settlement is Zerthladun, a large city with many
open fields and markets. It’s one of the few famous spots of order and
tranquility in the Elemental Chaos and probably one of the nicest given that the
list includes the City of Brass.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As far as 4e is concerned, githzerai were monks before it was cool. Speculation
about what the Monk class was going to be like started almost as soon as the
first PHB hit the shelves. A lot of players speculated about a “Ki” power
source, and IIRC the designers themselves began thinking in those terms, but
they soon realized writing up Orientalism as a power source was a bad move.</p>

<p>In the end, monks became psionic strikers and were published in the PHB 3
alongside playable githzerai. I imagine the stat blocks we’re about to see might
have inspired that decision to some degree.</p>

<p>As far as common traits go, githzerai are Medium Natural Humanoids, and are
faster on their feet than githyanki at Speed 7. They have a power named Iron
Mind, which allows them to gain +2 defense against an attack as an interrupt
once per encounter. This will be used to turn an attack that hit by 2 or less
into a miss.</p>

<h3 id="githzerai-cenobite">Githzerai Cenobite</h3>

<p>Cenobites are Level 11 Soldiers with 108 HP, representing the typical martial
artists PCs might meet. Rather than the mobile skirmishers you’d expect monks to
be, they’re the kind of fighter who stands their ground and chases the foe down.</p>

<p>They fight unarmed, and their fists are supposed to cause level-appropriate
damage. Instead of a basic strike they can use an at-will Stunning Fist, which
does a little less damage than the strike but stuns for a turn.</p>

<p>When an enemy shifts away using a movement mode the cenobite also has (i.e,
feet), the cenobite can shift to remain adjacent to them. That means a flying or
teleporting enemy is safe from this.</p>

<p>Their final technique is Trace Chance (Ranged 5; Recharge 6), which hits
automatically and causes the next melee attack made against the target to get a
+5 to-hit bonus and be turned into a critical if it connects. Note that this
attack doesn’t have to be from the cenobite!</p>

<h3 id="githzerai-zerth">Githzerai Zerth</h3>

<p>The counterparth to the githyanki gish, this represents an individual who
balances martial and psychic training. It’s a Level 13 Elite Controller with 248
HP.</p>

<p>Like the cenobite above, the zerth fights unarmed, with the same basic strike
and Trace Chance abilities. Its main ranged attack is Inner Spark (Ranged 5
vs. Reflex), which does lignthning damage and teleports the target 5 squares to
an unnocupied space of the zerth’s choosing.</p>

<p>Further teleport shenanigans are possible with Reorder Chaos (Ranged <em>sight</em>
vs. Fortitude), which targets up to 4 creatures and swaps their positions as the
zerth sees fit.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the zerth can let loose with Psychic Fists (Close Burst 5
vs. Will; enemies only) for some psychic damage. And in addition to Iron Mind,
it also has a technique named Avenging Wind that triggers as an interrupt when
the zerth is targeted with a ranged attack. This redirects the attack to another
creature of its choice within 5 squares, and allows the zerth to teleport up to
10 squares to become adjacent to the attacker.</p>

<p>In addition to fixing the zerth’s damage, I’d probably also give it the ability
to punch twice in an action, since it’s an elite.</p>

<h3 id="githzerai-mindmage">Githzerai Mindmage</h3>

<p>Mindmages put more emphasis on their mental training, though they can still
punch hard. They’re level 14 Artillery with 105 HP.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, their basic melee attack is an unarmed strike. Their main
ranged attack is the Mindstrike (Ranged 20 vs. Reflex), which does psychic
damage and dazes (save ends). Its other options include a Concussion Orb (Area
Burst 2 within 10 vs. Fortitude) that does physical damage and knocks prone, and
a series of Elemental Bolts (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex). Those allow up to 3 attacks
against different targets each of which can do one of fire, lightning, cold or
acid damage at the mindmage’s choice.</p>

<p>Concussion Orb is an encounter power and Elemental Bolts is daily. I don’t think
that makes much difference for a monster, honestly.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: 3 cenobites, a guardian naga, and a firelasher elemental. I’m sure
there’s an interesting story about this one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: 1 mindmage, 1 zerth, and 4 cenobites. Ninja death squad!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I really like these guys. They contrast with githyanki in an interesting way,
being approachable in a way their estranged siblings aren’t. I think it would
also be really cool for them to be the originators of the monk’s mystical
traditions in the setting.</p>

<p>5e would make them more morally ambiguous, saying they don’t mind let innocents
come to harm if it allows them to strike at the mind flayers or githyanki, but I
like them best as an Unaligned people that can produce heroic PCs or dastardly
villains in the same vein as the humans or elves. “Neutral” shouldn’t mean you
do equal amounts of good and evil.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Githyanki are another one of those D&amp;D monsters who surpass the “classic” and
hit the “iconic”. They originally appeared in the AD&amp;D 1st Edition Fiend Folio,
and were the creation of Charles Stross, who today is an award-winning science
fiction author. Here, they’re present in both books.</p>

<p>Judging by the other RPG.net Let’s Reads that are running at the same time as
this one, it seems like 3.x would spill a lot of ink creating other weird
extraplanar people in an attempt to make the “next githyanki”, mostly without
success. 5e would instead attempt to add new lore to them, with what I feel are
mixed results.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A very long time ago, or possibly a very long time in the future, the mind
flayers had a huge empire. This empire was built on the back of slaves. More
specifically, it was built on the back of the gith, a species broadly similar to
humanity.</p>

<p>The gith eventually rose up and gained their freedom by using the tools of their
tentacly oppressors: psychic powers! Once they didn’t have a common enemy to
unite against, the internal tensions of the gith began building up and
eventually exploded. The resulting conflict divided the gith into two people
with radically different philosophies: the xenophobic and militaristic
githyanki, and the contemplative and isolationist githzerai. We’ll focus on the
first here.</p>

<p>The githyanki migrated en masse to the Astral Sea and built their capital city
of Tu’narath on the corpse of a dead god. From there their astral ships sail on
piratical voyages, to juicy targets in the Astral Sea, the world, and perhaps
beyond.</p>

<p>Each ship captain has full discretion on which targets to pick and on how to run
their ship, but all ultimately answer to their lich queen Vlaakith, the supreme
ruler of the githyanki. A githyanki attack might be a simple raid, but it might
also be part of a more complex plan of their queen.</p>

<p>Aside from piracy, those astral ships also seek to find more of those gigantic
astral entity corpses and other such debris on which to build more cities and
expand their empire.</p>

<p>The preferred combat style of the githyanki mixes swordplay and psychic
powers. They wield psionically enchanted silver blades and use telekinesis to
perform impossible leaps and to attack at range with energy blasts. Their
initial publication back in the 1st Edition days probably did a lot to
popularize this “sword &amp; spell warrior” archetype, which is often nicknamed
“gish” in reference to them and is represented by the swordmage class in 4e.</p>

<p>Githyanki sometimes associate with red dragons, likely because both respect
martial prowess and have a hankerin’ for plundered treasure.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Despite living in the Astral Sea, githyanki are Medium Natural Humanoids since
they originated in the world. Their usual speed is 6 but armor may reduce that,
as for PCs.</p>

<p>All githyanki combatants wield a silver sword of some sort, which usually does
psychic damage. They can also perform a <strong>Telekinetic Leap</strong> as a move action
once per encounter, allowing themselves or an ally within 10 squares to fly 5
squares.</p>

<p>Their other psychic powers vary with each individual stat block. The MM versions
also have a +2 to saves against charm effects (meaning “powers with the Charm
keyword”), which is absent from the MV version.</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-warrior-both">Githyanki Warrior (Both)</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 12 Soldier with 118 HP, who wears plate and wields a
silver greatsword. Warriors likely make up the bulk of the crew on those pirate
ships, which would explain why they’re such a terror. The MV version is the best
of the two, so we’ĺl start with that and note the differences later.</p>

<p>That <strong>silver greatsword</strong> does psychic damage on a hit, and does bonus damage
against immobilized targets. As an effect, these basic attacks apply a
double-strenght mark against the target for a turn. This means the target gets a
-4 penalty to attack enemies other than the marking warrior instead of the usual
-2. I believe these are the only monsters to do so.</p>

<p>Warriors can also use a <strong>Telekinetic Grasp</strong> (Ranged 5 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6)
against Medium or smaller targets, doing no damage but immobilizing them (save
ends). Multiple warriors will know to split the tasks of immobilizing the PCs
and hitting them with the sword for that damage bonus.</p>

<p>The MV version is similar, but doesn’t mark with its attacks and the sword does
physical damage (the bonus damage is still psychic).</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-mindslicer-both">Githyanki Mindslicer (Both)</h3>

<p>This one focuses more on its powers than on its sword. It’s level 13 Artillery
with 98 HP. Again we start with the better MV version and note the differences
later.</p>

<p>The mindslicer’s weapon of choice is a <strong>silver longsword</strong>, which does psychic
damage as usual. It has two ranged options. <strong>Mindslice</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will)
does psychic damage at range. The <strong>Psychic Barrage</strong> (Area Burst 1 within 20
vs. Will; Recharge 6) spreads that over a wider area and adds a couple of nasty
riders: ongoing psychic damage and an inability to use daily or encounter powers
(save ends both).</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-raider-mv">Githyanki Raider (MV)</h3>

<p>This lightly-armored combatant is a Level 13 Skirmisher with 126 HP. Its
<strong>silver longsword</strong> deals psychic damage as usual, and it can shift 2 squares
as an effect when it attacks with the blade.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the raider can <strong>Slash and Dash</strong>, making an attack against
one creature, shifting up to its speed, and attacking another target. Each of
those does double the damage of a basic attack, half on a miss. As a move
action, it can shift up to 2 squares.</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-legionnaire-mv">Githyanki Legionnaire (MV)</h3>

<p>A Level 13 Minion Soldier which makes me thing I was wrong when I said the
Warrior above made up the bulk of their crews. This is basically a Minion
version of the warrior, down to its power selection and bonus damage against
immobilized targets.</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-gish-mm">Githyanki Gish (MM)</h3>

<p>This amusingly named fellow is a Level 15 Elite Skirmisher that might represent
a ship captain or officer. It has 226 HP, wears mail and wields a <strong>silver
longsword</strong>.</p>

<p>The basic attack is nothing special, dealing psychic damage with no riders. The
gish can make two of those per action. It can also shoot <strong>Force Bolts</strong> (Ranged
10 vs. Reflex; recharge 6) for a bit of ranged force damage. Once per encounter
it can fire off a <strong>Storm of Stars</strong>, performing four attacks (Ranged 5 vs. AC)
and dealing fire damage on those it hits.</p>

<p>The usual Telekinetic Leap is replaced by Astral Stride, an at-will move action
that allows the gish to teleport 6 squares and gain both insubstantial and
phasing for a turn. Yikes, I can see why this one didn’t make it into the
MV. It’s a bit too annoyingly hard to pin down.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The MM gives us three:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: 3 githyanki warriors and 2 redspawn firebelchers. Add them to the
list of people who do dragonspawn ranching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 4 warriors and 2 mindslicers. Your standard pirate squad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 3 warriors, 1 mindslicer, 1 gish and 1 nightmare. A captain and
their bodyguards plus a mount.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Replacing the nightmare in that third one with an adult red dragon turns it into
a level 19 encounter. Using a reskinned chimera instead makes it
level 17. Y’know, just in case you want to have some fun with your players.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Githyanki are pirates who fight like Jedi, which makes them awesome in my book!
A campaign centered on planar travel is well-served by their addition. Even if
that’s not a major theme, a sudden githyanki raid can make a nice random
encounter, or an unwelcome complication for an otherwise unrelated crisis.</p>

            <p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Gibbering beasts used to be several different monster entries that originally
appeared throughout AD&amp;D and 3.x in different places. Here they were quite
sensibly collected together. They appear only on the Monster Manual, but
received an MV-style update in Dungeon #192, so we’ll look at them there too.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A gibbering beast is a slimy, amorphous, oozelike creature covered in eyes and
mouths. And eyes with mouths. And mouths with eyes. And eyes inside mouths. And
is that a bunch of teeth just kinda sprouting from that quivering protuberance?</p>

<p>They crawl or float around, looking every which way with their eyes and
constantly spouting nonsense from their mouths, which they also use to attack
and eat other creatures. The nonsense can be just as dangerous as the bites, as
it warps the minds of those who hear it and makes them easy prey for the
beast.</p>

<p>The lesser varieties of gibbering beast spontaneously generate when something
dies in places touched by the influence of the Far Realm, which causes the
corpse’s face to detach and become a newborn beast. Over time they can grow and
become both smarter and more powerful. Sometimes the strongest varieties travel
directly from the Far Realm to the world, bent on enacting some insane scheme of
their own.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gibbering beasts are Aberrant Magical Beasts, and they all have All-Around
Vision and Darkvision. Creatures with All-Around Vision can’t be flanked, which
makes it a lot harder to get combat advantage against them.</p>

<p>Their other signature trait is their incessant <strong>Gibbering</strong>, a free action that
happens at the start of their turns: Close Burst 5 vs. Will, a hit dazes the
targets for a turn. Deafened creatures are immune to this.</p>

<p>All Gibbering Beasts are Unaligned, which is very appropriate for truly alien
aberrant entities.</p>

<h3 id="gibbering-mouther">Gibbering Mouther</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-gibbering-mouther.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The weakest and most classic among these entries, the gibbering mouther is
Medium and a Level 10 Controller with 110 HP. It moves at speed 5 on land, and
can swim at the same speed. Its mere presence warps the space around it, which
works as an Aura 3 that acts as difficult terrain against enemies.</p>

<p>The mouther’s basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> that deals physical damage and ongoing
5 acid damage (save ends). Its <strong>Gibbering</strong> works as described above, and opens
the way for <strong>Gibbering Feast</strong> (Close Burst 5), a power which causes unnatural
mouths to appear on any dazed creatures in the area and perform a basic bite
attack against them. Now <em>that’s</em> an aberrant creature! “Your left hand grows a
mouth and tries to eat your face” is top-notch horror imagery.</p>

<p>Gibbering mouthers have Int 4, and are sapient enough to work with other
aberrant or even non-aberrant creatures if they see advantage in doing so. The
Dungeon update is identical aside from the fixed damage numbers and the lack of
the Gibbering Feast’s colorful description.</p>

<h3 id="gibbering-abomination">Gibbering Abomination</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-gibbering-abomination.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2008 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A bigger mouther. It’s still Medium, but it’s a Level 18 Controller with 168
HP. It’s faster and trades some buoyancy for flight, with a land speed of 6 and
a flight speed of 4 (hover, maximum altitude 1).</p>

<p>Its <strong>Unnatural Utterances</strong> work as an Aura 5 that inflicts a -2 attack penalty
on any enemies caught within. They periodically increase in intensity to perform
the standard <strong>Gibbering</strong> attack.</p>

<p>The abomination’s basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Tentacle</strong> that does immediate
physical and ongoing psychic damage (save ends). It can also stare at you really
hard with the <strong>Eye of Despair</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will; Recharge 3-6), which does
psychic damage and immobilizes (save ends).</p>

<p>The gibbering abomination does extra “sneak attack” damage against creatures it
has combat advantage against, but it sadly lacks an extra-creepy ability like
Gibbering Feast. It does have Int 11, meaning it will make more complex (though
no less insane) plans than the mouther. The Dungeon update simply fixes its
damage totals.</p>

<h3 id="gibbering-orb">Gibbering Orb</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-gibbering-orb.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2008 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This Huge Level 27 Solo Controller has 1230 HP and has arrived directly from the
Far Realm to do Cthulhu-knows-what. With its Int 17, it’s capable of hatching
elaborate schemes. Given that it has a whole suite of <em>eye rays</em>, it might give
you an idea of what beholders were like before migrating to the world and being
mutated by the trip. It flies at speed 8 (hover).</p>

<p>The orb’s <strong>Merciless Eyes</strong> work like an Aura 5; anyone who starts their turn
inside and visible gets targetted by a random eye ray.</p>

<p>The orb’s basic bite attack does damage and causes the mouth that made it to
detach and automatically attack the target again at the start of the orb’s
subsequent turns! This lasts until the mouth misses with an attack, at which
point it falls off and rots.</p>

<p>The Gibbering works as for the other monsters, but is a Close Burst 10.</p>

<p>The orb can also spend its standard action to make two different eye ray attacks
in addition to any automatic ones from Merciless Eyes. The orb can choose which
rays it uses when it does this, from the following selection:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Mindcarving</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Will; psychic damage and daze (save ends).</li>
  <li><strong>Fleshtearing</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Fort; necrotic damage and ongoing
necrotic damage (save ends).</li>
  <li><strong>Bonewarping</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Fort; physical damage and weakness (save
ends).</li>
  <li><strong>Bloodfeasting</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Reflex; physical damage and ongoing physical
damave (save ends).</li>
  <li><strong>Farsending</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Reflex; transported to the Far Realm for a turn; on
return, takes psychic damage and suffers a -5 penalty to attacks until the
end of the encounter.</li>
  <li><strong>Souleating</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Will; slows (save ends); worsens to immobilization
on first failed save; target dies on second failed save.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s a pretty fearsome selection, and the names do a lot to evoke that body
horror feeling. It’s less varied than the rays available to a Beholder Eye
Tyrant, but every ray does damage, there’s two different ongoing damage effects
that can stack with each other and a daze to catch people the <strong>Gibbering</strong>
misses.</p>

<p>The farsending ray is also pretty brutal, since it instantly removes a character
from play for the whole next turn and saddles then with a long-lasting attack
penalty. Not <em>quite</em> as bad as death, but worse than a stun effect. And of
course there’s a gradual death effect.</p>

<p>Gibbering Orbs are boss battle material for a level 23 or 24 party, and with a
bit of leveling could be promoted to the “campaign end boss” role as one of
those Outer Gods that orbit Azathoth or the equivalent.</p>

<p>The Dungeon update reduces their HP to 984, and the radius of its Gibbering to
the standard 5 squares. It also fixes its damage, increasing it considerably.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>Gibbering beasts go well with any other aberrant or aberrant-adjacent creature
(like cultists and such). Even the gibbering mouther knows the value of
cooperation, and they certainly might be bullied into service by more powerful
monsters.</p>

<p>Unlike the other, lesser beasts, gibbering orbs prefer to work alone and don’t
seek out alliances. However, their presence generates spontaneous phenomena and
attracts creatures that end up effectively acting as its heralds and harbingers.</p>

<p>The sample encounters in the book are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 2 gibbering mouthers, 1 foulspawn seer, 2 foulspawn berserkers, and
1 chuul.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: 1 gibbering abomination, 2 nabassu gargoyles, 1 aboleth lasher and 2
kuo-toa guards.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>One constant theme in the comments I’ve been getting in these entries are that
few of the aberrant monsters seen so far seem worthy of that origin, being far
less alien than what someone would expect from the Far Realm.</p>

<p>I feel that if there’s one family of monsters worthy of the “Aberrant” title,
it’s the gibbering beasts. The Gibbering Orb is awesome in that role, and the
“basic” Gibbering Mouther is actually better at evoking horror than the
abomination, with its “your body grows mouths and tries to eat itself” attack.</p>
