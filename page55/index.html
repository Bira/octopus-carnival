<p>Specters have been in the game since the beginning, and here they’re only on the
Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>When I talked about ghosts, I mentioned that every single synonym for that word
used to be its own entirely separate type of incorporeal undead, and that 4e
consolidated that a bit but not entirely. Specters are one of the undead that
retained their own entry.</p>

<p>Specters are incorporeal undead that can form “naturally” when an evil murderer
or other equally depraved villain dies. Unlike a ghost, they don’t retain any
memory of their life, and aren’t bound to a particular location. However,
they’re just as evil as they always were, and their new hatred of the living
ensures they keep looking for people to kill.</p>

<p>Specters tend to cling to other equally malevolent undead, and will sometimes
ally with evil living beings if that would ensure a steady supply of victims.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Specters are Medium Shadow Humanoid with the Undead keyword. They have
darkvision as well as both the <strong>insubstantial</strong> and <strong>phasing</strong> traits. If
you’re using Monster Vault-era rules this means they take half damage from
everything but force attacks, but when specters were published they took half
damage from all sources. Their HP is a bit lower than their level would
indicate, so being insubstantial doesn’t make fights last that much longer.</p>

<p>As undead, they’re immune to disease and poison and have some degree of necrotic
resistance and radiant vulnerability. They have no ground speed, but they fly,
and it’s not like you can force a specter to land.</p>

<h3 id="specter">Specter</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 4 Lurker with 30 HP and all the traits mentioned
above. It flies at speed 6, has 10 necrotic resistance, and 5 radiant
vulnerability.</p>

<p>The specter has a <strong>Spectral Chill</strong> aura (1), which inflicts a -2 penalty to
all enemy defenses. It attacks with a <strong>Spectral Touch</strong> that targets Reflex and
does necrotic damage. It can also unleash a <strong>Spectral Barrage</strong> (close burst 2
vs. Will) which does psychic damage and knocks prone. This is likely some sort
of scary illusion.</p>

<p>As a standard action, the specter can become <strong>invisible</strong> until it attacks or
is hit by an attack. It will likely alternate between attacking from
invisibility, and retreating while invisible.</p>

<h3 id="voidsoul-specter">Voidsoul Specter</h3>

<p>This is either the specter of someone really evil, or a basic model that has
grown bloated through years of post-mortem murder. It’s a Level 23 Lurker with
115 HP. Its necrotic resistance increases to 30, and its radiant vulnerability
to 10.</p>

<p><strong>Spectral Touch</strong> works the same with bigger numbers. The <strong>Spectral Chill</strong>
aura is stronger, dealing 10 cold damage to enemies caught inside in addition to
inflicting the same -2 defense penalty. Its special attack is <strong>Life Siphon</strong>
(Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude; encounter) which deals necrotic damage and makes
the specter heal 5 HP for every target damaged by it. Finally, its
<strong>invisibility</strong> works the same but becomes a 1/round minor action instead of a
standard one.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter has a basic specter, a deathlock wight, and a bunch of
zombies and skeletons.</p>

<p>Specters feel to me like one of those monsters that should have been rolled into
the “Ghost” entry. They don’t have much to distinguish them from ghosts or from
wraiths (the other surviving synomym). I’d guess that’s why they didn’t make the
Monster Vault.</p>

<p>I believe Sorrowsworn started out as a type of Forgotten Realms demon in 2e, but
now they’re something different. They’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Sorrowsworn resemble undead demons in appearance, though they’re neither demons
nor undead. Rather, they’re a sort of living avatar of death. Does that sound
contradictory to you? Deep mysteries tend to be like that.</p>

<p>You see, they’re not a natural species. Most are divine servitors of the Raven
Queen, transformed into their current state by her powers. Some were mortals
particularly attuned to death and its related concepts who managed to ascend on
their own.</p>

<p>Both types were often shadar-kai in their mortal lives. Becoming sorrowsworn is
seen by them as a glorious ascension, since it makes them not only ageless but
also more goth than anything mortal.</p>

<p>Sorrowsworn feed on grief, and so tend to hang out at the sites of great
catastrophes or conflicts. Those who serve the Raven Queen are also tasked with
hunting down beings who have cheated death. This doesn’t mean people who were
the subject of Raise Dead - rather, it’s people who have found a way to stick
around beyond their appointed time. Most often they’re some sort of undead like
vampires, liches or nightwalkers, but I guess someone who hunts phoenixes and
regularly huffs their powdered feathers would fit as well.</p>

<p>Sorrowsworn lairs are bleak caves and pits whose walls are covered in tiny
alcoves containing trophies from their past victims. These are arranged in
tableaus that each tell a more depressing story than the last. Flocks of
shadowravens (sinister half-spirit birds) hang out in these lairs, and swarm to
attack intruders. These swarms also often fly out with their sorrowsworn
masters, acting as heralds and allies to them in combat.</p>

<p>Their greatest enemies are the Nightwalkers, since they are anathema to all of
the Raven Queen’s precepts. Death Giants are also frequent foes. Of course,
despite their opposition to undeath they’re not really that nice themselves, and
have their own stuff going on when they’re not on holy missions for the Raven
Queen. That means they can easily end up fighting your PCs even when none of
them are guilty of cheating death.</p>

<p>As sorrowsworn like to fight with scythes, I figure the symbol of death in 4e’s
implied setting isn’t a robed skeleton, but a sorrowsworn. At least when it’s
not an image of the Raven Queen.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Sorrowsworn are Medium Shadow Humanoids and have Darkvision. Their signature
trait is <strong>Bleak Visage</strong>, a fear effect which inflicts a -2 penalty on melee
and ranged attacks targetting them (close and area attacks are unaffected).</p>

<p>They use scythes in combat and their powers are a blend of teleportation and
psychic attacks. They don’t have any elemental resistances of vulnerabilities,
which is interesting.</p>

<h3 id="sorrowsworn-soulripper">Sorrowsworn Soulripper</h3>

<p>This Level 25 Skirmisher has 236 HP and a land speed of 10. Unlike most of its
colleagues, it fights unarmed, with <strong>claws</strong> that do a mix of physical and
psychic damage, and deal extra damage when it has combat advantage.</p>

<p>It will often <strong>Flutter and Strike</strong> (recharge 5-6), which allows it to teleport
10 squares and make an attack with combat advantage at the arrival
point. <strong>Sorrow’s Rush</strong> is an encounter power that allows it to move 10 squares
and attack up to three different targets along the movement path.</p>

<h3 id="sorrowsworn-reaper">Sorrowsworn Reaper</h3>

<p>A Level 27 Soldier with 254 HP, this is likely the one that replaces the robed
skeleton as the D&amp;D setting’s “grim reaper” figure. It runs and climbs at speed
8, with Spider Climb.</p>

<p>It wields <strong>Sorrow’s Scythe</strong>, which does psychic damage and marks for a
turn. It can also use a <strong>Reaping Blow</strong> (recharge 6), which is stronger and
heals the reaper for 60 HP if it reduces the target to 0.</p>

<h3 id="sorrowsworn-deathlord">Sorrowsworn Deathlord</h3>

<p>This Level 28 Lurker (Leader) has 204 HP. It’s surrounded by an aura (1) of
<strong>Mournful Whispers</strong> that daze any enemies caught inside for a turn. It runs at
speed 8, flies at speed 10, and has phasing.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Dark Scythe</strong> deals necrotic and psychic damage, and weakens for a
turn. It can also <strong>Reap and Fade</strong> (recharge 3-6), which allows it to make an
attack, teleport 10 squares, and become insubtantial for a turn in that order.</p>

<p>This is a lurker that inverts the usual routine! Instead of attacking every
other turn, it can only <em>be attacked</em> every other turn, assuming it takes care
to phase into a wall, floor, or ceiling after it attacks. So it moves in,
attacks, and is exposed until its next action, when it attacks and moves
away. Reap and Fade makes it even harder to pin down, as it can move in and use
the ability to attack and immediately move away again.</p>

<h3 id="shadowraven-swarm">Shadowraven Swarm</h3>

<p>A shadowraven swarm counts as a Medium Shadow Beast with the Swarm
keyword. It’s a Level 27 Brute with 296 HP. It has a land speed of 2 and a
flight speed of 12, and all the standard swarm traits: a Swarm Attack aura, half
damage from single target attacks, and 10 extra damage from area ones.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>Swam of Talons</strong> that does a mix of physical and
necrotic damage. Once bloodied, it can use the <strong>Murder’s Wrath</strong> encounter
power, allowing it to fly 6 squares, move through other creatures’s squares, and
make a basic attack against anyone whose square it moves through.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Sorrowsworn tend to group with each other, with deathlords running the show and
the others following their orders. They’re often accompanied by shadowraven
swarms, and ride fell wyverns.</p>

<p>One of the sample encounters here also has them alongside the epic-level
dragonborn deathknight, which hints that not all of them hate undead.</p>

<p>Sorrowsworn fill the same niche as rot harbingers: as regulars, they’re supposed
to be the basic building block for encounters in a late Epic adventure focusing
on their patron. I feel they work a lot better, though, as they have more
interesting maneuvers in their stat blocks. They also don’t rely exclusively on
necrotic damage, so it’s harder to get protection against their attacks.</p>

<p>I guess this explains why Orcus isn’t likely to usurp the Raven Queen anytime
soon!</p>

<p>You can still use sorrowsworn in a campaign where the PCs aren’t likely to
oppose the Raven Queen. There might very well be renegade sorrowsworn out there,
and you could also reskin them and make them undead to use as better rot
harbingers in a campaign focused on opposing Orcus.</p>

<p>Snakes have been in the game since the beginning. They are present both in the
Monster Manual and in the animal appendix of the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Snakes are real world animals, but there’s a huge body of legend surrounding
them in practically every culture. D&amp;D seems to be partial to the Western
depiction of snakes as treacherous and deadly, since it has Zehir as one of its
evil gods.</p>

<p>Still, this entry focuses on <em>monstrous</em> snakes. The mundane varieties likely
behave pretty much as they do in the real world, with a lot of them being
harmless and the dangerous ones only attacking if they feel threatened.</p>

<p>Though monstrous snakes are large and aggressive enough to actively hunt people,
most are still merely dangerous animals. A rare few might be blessed by Zehir,
though, which makes them sapient, evil, and more powerful.</p>

<p>Between the two books we have quite a lot of different snake stat blocks.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Snakes are so varied that they have little in common that I can discuss
here. They’re all beasts, they all have the Reptile keyword, and they all
bite. That’s it.</p>

<h3 id="spitting-cobra-monster-vault">Spitting Cobra (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>The closest you’ll get to a real snake here. Spitting Cobras are Small Natural
Beasts, and Level 5 Minion Soldiers. Their <strong>bite</strong> does poison damage and marks
for a turn, and their <strong>Blinding Spittle</strong> (ranged 5 vs. Reflex; recharge 4+)
does the same damage and blinds (save ends).</p>

<p>I could see an eccentric kobold artificer firing these out of a cannon, or a
priest of Zehir summoning them out of thin air.</p>

<h3 id="deathrattle-viper-both">Deathrattle Viper (Both)</h3>

<p>Pretty much a dire rattlesnake. It inhabits forests, jungles, and caves, though
they wouldn’t look out of place in a desert either. These vipers are Medium
Natural Beasts, and Level 5 Brutes with 75 HP. They have low-light vision, and
resist 10 poison. Their land speed is 4, and they also have a climb speed of 4.</p>

<p>Their bony tails produce a magically enhanced <strong>Death Rattle</strong> that acts as an
aura (2) which inflicts a -2 attack penalty to all enemies inside. This is a
fear effect.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> allows a secondary attack vs. Fortitude on a hit, which delivers
their venom in the form of immediate and ongoing poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Deathrattle Vipers also appear in the Monster Vault, and are identical aside
from their updated bite damage. Their low speed makes running away from them a
feasible tactic even for someone in heavy armor, so they should be paired with
other monsters that make this more difficult.</p>

<h3 id="crushgrip-constrictor-both">Crushgrip Constrictor (Both)</h3>

<p>This is what you’d get if all the shit they say about boas and anacondas was
true. They’re found in jungles, marshes, and underground. Constrictors are Large
Natural Beasts and Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They have land, climb and swim
speeds of 6. They’re the other snake that exists in both books.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> does damage and grabs on a hit, as the snake quickly coils around
the target. The escape DC 25 for Athletics and 22 for Acrobatics in the MM, and
a gentler 17 in the MV.</p>

<p>Against a grabbed target they can <strong>Constrict</strong>, which targets Fortitude, does a
nice chunk of physical damage, and dazes for a turn.</p>

<p>No explicit mention is made of how many targets the snake can have grabbed. If
you’re being relatively realistic, it should be just one. Larger or more
supernatural versions might be able to coil around multiple unfortunates.</p>

<h3 id="flame-snake-monster-manual">Flame Snake (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>A snake from the Elemental Chaos. Not much is written about its origins, so it
could be a case of parallel evolution or one of those rare instances where
creatures from the world migrated to the other planes and adapted to them. As
fire elementals, they can be summoned and controlled by magic.</p>

<p>Flame Snakes are Medium Elemental Beasts with the Fire and Reptile
keywords. They’re Level 9 Artillery with 74 HP and Resist Fire 20. They have a
speed of 6, but can’t climb or swim. They also can’t see in the dark, though
it’s reasonable to say their incandescent bodies would shed light.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> does a mix of physical and fire damage, and they can <strong>Spit
Fire</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex), doing both immediate and ongoing fire damage
(save ends).</p>

<h3 id="shadow-snake-monster-manual">Shadow Snake (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>The blessed of Zehir, these two-headed monsters are made of solid shadow and are
venerated by Yuan-ti. They’re level 16 Skirmishers with 158 HP. They slither at
speed 7 and have a climb speed of 7. Their Int is 4: they’re not exactly
sapient, but are very cunning, and also Evil.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bites</strong> do physical and ongoing poison damage (save ends), and they can
make <strong>Double Attacks</strong> because of the two heads. Once per encounter they can
make a <strong>Shifting Shadowstrike</strong>, shifting their speed (7) and biting two
different targets as they do so.</p>

<p>Also once per encounter, they can <strong>Vanish Into the Night</strong>, which makes them
insubstantial, gives them phasing, and makes them invisible in dim light. All of
this lasts for a turn and makes for an excellent “escape hatch” when the fight
starts to go badly. I imagine shadow snakes very rarely fight to the death -
they’d be smart enough to cut and run.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual seems to think reptiles gotta stick together, so it has a
bunch of encounters that feature snakes alongside level-appropriate sapient
reptiles that act as their handlers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Death rattlers and lizardfolk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Constrictors and snaketongue cultists (which aren’t reptiles, exactly, but are
close enough).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flame Snakes and troglodytes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shadow Snakes and yuan-ti.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I imagine you could use death rattlers as “minibosses” in low-level adventures
featuring kobolds, as well.</p>

<p>These snakes don’t exactly rock my world, but I feel they’re still a good
addition to the game.</p>

<p>Slaads show up in the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition Monster Manual (though they might have
appeared earlier in a supplement for 1e). In Fourth Edition, they are only on
the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Slaads are froggy-looking monsters who inhabit the Elemental Chaos and whose
psychology can be summed up as “LOL, so random”. Their grip on reality, both
mental and physical, is very tenuous. Your typical Slaad makes the Mad Hatter
look quite centered, and any relationship between what it says to you and what’s
actually happening tends to be coincidental. Not that most people get a chance
to talk to them - most of their interactions with other beings are violent.</p>

<p>The main reason everyone hates them, though, is that they reproduce by sinking
their ovopositor claws into people and injecting them with eggs, which hatch
explosively in a few days to produce a “tadpole” the size of a large dog. That
tadpole, in turn, takes another handful of days to grow into an adult. In true
slaad fashion, the sub-type of the new individual is random and has no relation
to the sub-type of its parent. Having a slaad egg implanted in you is treated as
a disease called Chaos Phage by the rules.</p>

<p>Slaads were Chaotic Neutral in the old alignment system and 3e in particular
made a big deal out of saying they were an expression of “pure chaos untainted
by morality”. The distinction between that and Chaotic Evil turned out to be
largely academic, though, so in 4e’s alignment system all slaads are Chaotic
Evil. They’re not out for omniversal destruction like demons are, but “fuck shit
up for shits and giggles” fits both their usual MO and the description of
Chaotic Evil.</p>

<p>There’s a bit in Secrets of the Plane Below about how slaads used to be both
more protean and mentally stable back in Olden Times, but a couple of
particularly powerful slaads broke their metaphysics to ensure they would remain
at the top of the heap. That’s why they all look like humanoid frogs, and why
they are color-coded for your convenience despite being “the most chaotic”
creatures.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Most Slaads are Medium Elemental Humanoids. They have low-light vision, a land
speed of 6, and a variable teleport speed. They’re also immune to Chaos Phage,
just to underscore that they need to infect non-slaads to reproduce.</p>

<p>Every slaad has a basic <strong>claw</strong> attack that does damage as normal for the
monster and triggers a secondary attack vs. Fortitude on a hit. If the secondary
attack hits, the victim is infected with Chaos Phage. Other attacks and powers
vary with the type of slaad.</p>

<p>Chaos Phage is a nasty level 16 disease, with an Improve DC of 25 and a Maintain
DC of 20. Stage 1 has no visible symptoms, but there’s a slaad egg inside you
now. Stage 2 inflicts a -2 penalty to Will and makes you go berserk while
bloodied, forcing you to always attack the closest living creature (ally or
enemy). Stage 3 is death as a slad tadpole rips you open and crawls out.</p>

<h3 id="slaad-tadpole">Slaad Tadpole</h3>

<p>Tadpoles are Small, which means they’re the size of a large dog or a
halfling. They’re Level 5 Lurkers with 44 HP, and are more interested in running
and growing up than in fighting. They have a weak bite that makes them
insubstantial for a turn when it hits, and they can shift 2 squares as an
interrupt when attacked in melee.</p>

<p>Tadpoles are suitable for use in an heroic-tier adventure where the goal is to
prevent them from growing into adult slaads.</p>

<h3 id="grey-slaad">Grey Slaad</h3>

<p>Also known as Rift Slaads, these used to be among the most powerful in their
ladder, but have been somewhat demoted. They’re Level 13 Skirmishers with 128
HP, a teleport speed of 4, and all common slaad traits.</p>

<p>Rift slaads mostly fight with their claws, and back them up with space-bending
defensive powers. Once per encounter they can <strong>Induce Planar Instability</strong>
(Close Burst 3 vs. Will), which does a little damage, slides the targets 3
squares, and knocks them prone. When they’re hit with an attack that causes a
condition (like slowed, dazed, and so on), they can use <strong>Condition Transfer</strong>
as an interrupt to make the condition affect someone else instead. This counts
as a Ranged 5 attack vs. the Fortitude of the chosen target.</p>

<p>When they’re first bloodied, rift slaads cause a <strong>Planar Flux</strong> that teleports
them 8 squares and turns them insubstantial for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="red-slaad">Red Slaad</h3>

<p>Also know as Blood Slaads, these are straightforward bruiser types. They’re
Level 15 Soldiers with 146 HP and all common slaad traits. Their land speed is
8, and their teleport speed 4. They have a second basic attack in the form of a
<strong>bite</strong> that does a bit more damage than the claws but doesn’t inject any eggs.</p>

<p>Their main special technique is the <strong>Leaping Pounce</strong> (recharge 5-6) which
allows them to shift 4 squares and make two claw attacks against 1 or 2
enemies. If any of them hit, the target is marked for a turn. This is the only
way they have to mark enemies.</p>

<p>Once per encounter a blood slaad can produce a <strong>Horrid Croak</strong> (close blast 5
vs. Fortitude) that does no damage but immobilizes its targets for a turn on a
hit.</p>

<h3 id="blue-slaad">Blue Slaad</h3>

<p>Also known as Talon Slaads, they’re notable for having Wolverine-like bone claws
sprouting from their hands. Talon Slaads are Level 17 Brutes with 200 HP. Their
teleport speed is 2.</p>

<p>Their big talons transmit the Chaos Phage as usual, and can also be used to
<strong>fling</strong> victims willy-nilly. This is a bit weaker than the basic attack but
slides the target 2 squares and knocks it prone on a hit.</p>

<p>Once it’s bloodied, the talon slaad gains access to <strong>Ravager’s Fury</strong> (close
burst 2 vs. AC; encounter), an attack that gives it 20 temporary HP if it hits
anyone.</p>

<h3 id="green-slaad">Green Slaad</h3>

<p>Also known as Curse Slaads, they’re the brains of the family with Int 15 where
the others have 9 or 11. A curse slaad is a Level 18 Controller with 173
HP. It’s teleport speed is 6, equal to its normal movement, so it has no reason
to walk anywhere.</p>

<p>Aside from the usual claws, they can shoot <strong>Chaos Bolts</strong> as a ranged basic
attack vs. Will, which do untyped damage and daze for a turn. Occasionally they
can use <strong>Transpose Target</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex; recharge 6) to do some
damage and teleport a target 10 squares to somewhere it can see. And once per
encounter it can use a <strong>Croak of Chaos</strong> (close burst 4 vs. Fortitude) to do
damage over an area and slide the targets 4 squares, rearranging most of the
battlefield.</p>

<p>Green Slaads were also the most “wizardly” of the bunch, so they could very well
know all sorts of weird rituals and non-combat magic.</p>

<h3 id="black-slaads">Black Slaads</h3>

<p>When your run-of-the-chaotic-mill slaad gets infected by the energies of the
Abyss, you get one of these. Also known as Void Slaads, they lose the ability to
reproduce but gain all sorts of entropy-based powers and a more active
malevolence than that of their lesser kin. A lot of their attacks are
energy-based or infused, but since that energy is pure entropy their damage is
untyped.</p>

<p>Void Slaads are Level 20 Skirmishers with 191 HP. They’re Large, immune to all
disease (not just Chaos Phage) and insubstantial. They run at speed 6 and
teleport at speed 3. They retain their standard low-light vision.</p>

<p>A void slaad’s <strong>Claws</strong> don’t lay eggs. Instead, in addition to their standard
damage they do 10 ongoing damage (save ends). Each failed save eats a healing
surge in addition to prolonging the damage! Perhaps they implant miniature black
holes instead of eggs.</p>

<p>They attack at range with <strong>Rays of Entropy</strong> (ranged 20 vs. Reflex), which
damage and surround the target with an entropic shroud (save ends). While the
shroud is active, the target takes extra damage from all attacks that hit it!</p>

<p>When a void slaad dies, it explodes into a <strong>Zone of Obivion</strong> (close burst 2
vs. Reflex) that damages everything in its area. It persists until the end of
the encounter, blocking line of sight and dealing the same damage as the initial
attack to everything that enters it.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Most slaad encounters are slaad-only, but sometimes they’ll ally themselves with
other creatures for some mysterious reason. The sample MM encounters present two
such situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 2 gray slaads, 2 red slaads, and a destrachan far voice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 19: 1 black slaad, 2 rockfire dreadnoughts, a fire giant forgecaller,
and 2 firebred hellhounds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I kinda like these guys, and I like that they’re Chaotic Evil in 4e. I never
bought that story about how they’re some pure manifestation of Chaotic Neutral
even though most of what they do is kill people and lay eggs in their chest
cavities, not necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>I had never read of skull lords before reading about them here, but they have a
very 3e vibe to them so likely originated there. They are only on the Monster
Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Despite the imposing name and the very Metal illustration, skull lords are made
to be lieutenants. They’re created by powerful necromancers or liches to command
their hordes of lesser undead, so they always answer to some higher power.</p>

<p>The book doesn’t get into much more detail than that, but it seems to me like
skull lords are created undead similar to skeletons. They were never alive and
the bones are just raw materials for their creation. Unlike common skeletons,
they’re sapient and quite intelligent.</p>

<p>The first skull lords in recorded history emerged from the ruins of the Black
Tower of Vumerion. Vumerion was a “legendary human necromancer” who apparently
had his career cut short by a band of intrepid adventurers, and those skull
lords might have been part of his contingency plans. They roam the land looking
for a way to bring their dread master back to the world.</p>

<p>The ritual for making skull lords eventually made its way out of those tower
ruins, too, so you might find these monsters working for anyone with the stomach
to make them.</p>

<p>Each of those three skulls anchors a different set of magic powers, and all
three must be destroyed to destroy the monster itself.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Skull Lords are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead keyword, and Level 10
Artillery with a paltry 40 HP. This is not a typo, and you’ll see why soon. They
have darkvision, a speed of 6, and the standard undead resistances (immunity to
disease and poison, necrotic resistance, radiant vulnerability).</p>

<p>Skull lords project an aura (2) named <strong>Master of The Grave</strong>, which grants
Regeneration 5 and a +2 bonus to saves to any undead allies inside. The aura is
anchored to the Skull of Death’s Command, below, so if that’s destroyed it
stops.</p>

<p>The skull lord’s basic attack is a <strong>Bone Staff</strong> that does a mix of physical
and necrotic damage, but the three skulls are the main event. Each has an attack
power that can be used as a minor action once per round, meaning the skull lord
can use all of them in its turn if it doesn’t move.</p>

<p>The <strong>Skull of Bonechilling Fear</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will) does a bit of cold
damage and pushes 5 squares on a hit as it makes the target run away.</p>

<p>The <strong>Skull of Whithering Flame</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) does fire and
necrotic damage.</p>

<p>And the <strong>Skull of Death’s Command</strong> (Ranged 10) restores a destroyed undead
minion within range. This an instance where I think the word “minion” <em>isn’t</em>
being used as a game term, since the text also mentions the minion has “full
normal hit points” when restored. So yeah, what this does is bring back an
undead creature under the skull lord’s command as long as it’s level is at most
the skull lord’s +2 (12 by default). The creature appears in the square where it
was destroyed and stands up as a free action. It has full HP and can act
normally when its next action rolls around. This is an <em>at-will</em> power, just
like the others.</p>

<p>One additional effect of these <strong>Triple Skulls</strong> is that when the lord hits 0
HP, a random skull is destroyed and it instantly heals back to full. It loses
the powers associated with the destroyed skull but is otherwise able to keep
acting normally. This is why it only has 40 HP - it’s a multi-stage monster
whose HP total is 120.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounters are nothing surprising:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 2 skull lords and 3 skeletal tomb guardians.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: 1 skull lord, 1 vampire lord, 2 zombie hulks, 9 vampire spawn
bloodhunters.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in both cases the skull lords could restore any of the other monsters
in these encounters. If the PCs don’t learn to destroy the skull lords first,
they’re gonna have a bad time.</p>

<p>I like these things! They look badass and can be quite dangerous.</p>
