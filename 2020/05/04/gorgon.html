<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>In Greek mythology, the Gorgons are a trio of sisters whose bodies were partly
composed of snakes and whose visage could turn people to stone. Medusa was one
of the Gorgons (the other were Stheno and Euryale). If you say the word “Gorgon”
to anyone, they’ll probably think of Medusa, unless they’re D&amp;D players.</p>

<p>D&amp;D uses the word “Medusa” as a species name for the snake-haired ladies, and
“Gorgon” for these carapaced cows with a poison breath. They, in turn, are based
on a monster from medieval European folklore whose poison gas came out of the
other end. They appear only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>There isn’t much to go on here. Gorgons are elemental beasts known for their
foul temper and deadly breath weapons. In the wild they roam in small herds of
3-7 individuals made up of one bull and his harem of cows. Young males acquire a
herd by challenging and defeating its current bull. Those who fail at this roam
alone or in pairs and are likely even more aggressive than usual.</p>

<p>Taming gorgons is quite hard, but it happens. Those who most often succed at it
are other elemental creatures, particularly giants.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gorgons are Large Elemental Beasts whose signature traits are Truesight and a
complete immunity to forced movement and being knocked prone. They also have a
breath weapon of some sort, though its effect varies with the stat block.</p>

<h2 id="iron-gorgon">Iron Gorgon</h2>

<p>This is the one that’s closest to the “classic” D&amp;D gorgon of editions
past. It’s a Level 11 Soldier with 120 HP and the common traits listed above. It
has the Earth keyword, runs at Speed 6 with Earth Walk, and is immune to
petrification.</p>

<p>The iron gorgon’s basic attack is a Gore, though I imagine it will most often
Trample instead. This allows it to move its speed, go through enemy spaces, and
perform an attack against any enemy whose space they go through. This is a
little weaker than the gore but will likely target multiple PCs. The movement
draws opportunity attacks as normal.</p>

<p>Ocasionally, the iron gorgon will perform an Earthshaking Charge (recharge 5-6),
which does more damage than the basic attack and pushes a Medium or smaller
target 3 squares, also knocking it prone.</p>

<p>Finally, it can use the Petrifying Breath that made it famous (Close blast 3
vs. Fortitude; recharge 6). It does poison damage, dazes and slows (save
ends). This worsens to immobilized on the first failed saved, and to permanent
petrification on the second. Other gorgons are immune to this breath weapon,
which means they don’t have to worry about friendly fire when you fight the
whole herd.</p>

<h2 id="storm-gorgon">Storm Gorgon</h2>

<p>Explicitly called out as the favorite herd animal of storm titans, the mighty
storm gorgon is a Level 26 Skirmisher with 248 HP and all traits listed
above. To them it adds a Tempest’s Fury aura (size 5) that does 20 lightning
damage to anyone caught inside, which is impressive even for an epic
creature. It also has 20 lightning and thunder resistance, runs at Speed 8 and
flies at Speed 10 with hover capability.</p>

<p>Its basic gore attack does a mix of physical and thunder damage, and also always
pushes the target 2 squares and knocks it prone on a hit. It can use that as
part of a Mobile Melee Attack where it moves its speed without drawing
opportunity attacks and makes an attack at any point in this movement. They can
also Trample like iron gorgons if they want to spread the hurt more widely.</p>

<p>Their breath is a storm (Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude), which does a whole bunch
of lignthing and thunder damage but doesn’t have any riders.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter here is level 27: 2 storm gorgons, 1 storm titan, and 2
dragonborn champions. I imagine this is a lord taking a walk with his favored
pets and their minders. Yes, the Dragonborn Champions are pet minders - anyone
less tough would be killed by those storm auras.</p>

<p>Confusing naming conventions aside, I quite like these deadly bovines. They’re
in dire need of a damage fix, of course, and I would probably shift the
conditions on the iron gorgon’s petrifying breath around. Something like slowed
-&gt; immobilized and dazed -&gt; petrified.</p>

<p>How about some fan-made gorgon lore? I imagine they’re native to the Elemental
Chaos, and were brought to the world by the giants way back when. Wild specimens
can be found in both planes, descended from escaped members of giant herds who
went back to nature.</p>

<p>While storm gorgons (below) are explicitly called out as being a favorite of
storm titans, I imagine hill giants would be just as fond of iron
gorgons. Those groups who grow adept at gorgon ranching have less reason to raid
neighboring settlements for food. Their territories might be full of giant-sized
statues left over from the process of becoming adept at gorgon-ranching too.</p>

<p>You know who else might be good at herding gorgons? The githzerai. They’d have
to be if they use animal products at all. Normal cattle would have trouble
surviving in the Elemental Chaos.</p>
