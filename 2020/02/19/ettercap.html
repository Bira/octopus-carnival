<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>My first contact with ettercaps was in Neverwinter Nights, where if you found a
bunch of giant spiders in a lower-level module you could be sure an ettercap
wasn’t far behind. They’ve been around since at least 2nd edition, when they
appear in the Monstrous Manual. It’s likely earlier editions featured them in
a supplement.</p>

<p>In 4e they still fulfill pretty much the same narrative role as before: hostile,
non-drow spider-wranglers. They appear only on the MM.</p>

<h3 id="the-lore">The Lore</h3>

<p>Ettercaps are sapient humanoids, give or take a few extra limbs. They’re not
terribly bright with a typical Int score of 5. The book describes them as
“primitive, instinctual hunters”, which I guess means Stone Age-level
technology. If evolution was a thing in D&amp;D they’d probably be related to
spiders in the same way humans are to apes.</p>

<p>Ettercaps are carnivorous and hunt using both weapons and their copious natural
gifts, which includes a venomous bite, the ability to produce webs, and a
“spiritual kinship” with arachnids that give them a nearly unmatched ability to
tame these beasts.</p>

<p>Despite being Unaligned, ettercaps don’t mind including other sapients in their
menu, such as your PCs.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>The MM gives us two ettercap stat blocks. They’re Medium Natural Humanoids with
the Spider keyword. Their signature traits are Resist 10 Poison, a climb speed
with Spider Climb, and Web Walker, which allows them to ignore difficult terrain
and other movement effects from spider webs and spider swarms.</p>

<p>They also get a spider bite and some sort of web-spinning power, though the
exact forms these take vary in each stat block.</p>

<h3 id="ettercap-fang-guard">Ettercap Fang Guard</h3>

<p>This level 4 Soldier has 56 HP and all the common traits described above. Its
speed is 5 in all movement modes. It wears leather and wields a greataxe in
combat.</p>

<p>The basic greataxe attack has the High Crit property but is otherwise pretty
standard. The fang guard’s spider bite requires combat advantage and does a less
damage than the axe, but triggers a secondary attack against Fortitude that
stuns the victim for a turn and causes ongoing poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>The fang guard gains +2 to attack and damage rolls against a restrained or
immobilized target, and it can try to immobilize them with its Web Tangle
attack, which targets reflex and immobilizes (save ends) without doing damage.</p>

<p>I suspect a MV-style makeover would likely make the spider bite a single
attack against Fortitude.</p>

<h3 id="ettercap-webspinner">Ettercap Webspinner</h3>

<p>I believe this one is the closest to the “classic model” from previous
editions. A Level 5 Controller with 64 HP, the web spinner also possesses the
standard abilities outlined at the start of this section.</p>

<p>It fights with a Reach 2 longspear, and its spider bite doesn’t stun but still
does ongoing damage. As a 1/round minor action, the webspinner can cast a Range
5 Web Net that targets reflex and restrains on a hit (save ends; no
damage). With a bit of effort it can make a bigger net and create a zone of
Webbed Terrain (Area 2 Within 10 vs Reflex), which immobilizes everyone it hits
(save ends) and creates a zone of difficult terrain until the end of the
encounter. This recharges on a 6, so you might end up with quite a lot of
webbing all over the battlefield if you roll well or have multiple webspinners
in an encounter.</p>

<p>Any ettercap can safely ignore the difficult terrain from the webs, and this is
likely true of a lot of other spider monsters, so they’ll want to use this as
often as they can.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 4: 1 webspinner, 2 fang guards, and 2 deathjump
spiders.</p>

<p>One mechanical problem I see with these ettercaps is that they must usually
choose between doing damage and impairing movement on each of their
turns. They’re also built with a more “naturalistic” approach that actually
makes the Level 5 webspinner do less damage in its attacks than the Level 4 Fang
Guard. If neither issue is fixed, they’ll be less of a threat against the PCs
than the numbers might indicate.</p>

<p>In the end I see no reason to include ettercaps in your game unless you’re going
all-in on the spider theme, and I don’t lament their absence from the Monster
Vault.</p>
