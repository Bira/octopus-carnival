            <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>I’ve been sitting on this one for a while now. I’m not gonna lie, writing and
publishing those Monster Manual posts is quite soothing. Particularly the
releasing part, which is just a few mechanical actions now that I have so much
pre-written material for it. Every once in a while I’ll sit and write something
that’s on my mind, and hesitate a bit before posting it. This is one such post,
which I’d say was written somewhere around late April or early May.</p>

<h2 id="the-post">The Post</h2>

<p>One of the outtakes from <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/11/16/on-transhuman-space.html">my last screed against Transhuman Space</a> was a
rebuttal to the bit where it says it’s better and more realistic than cyberpunk
because it doesn’t have any apocalyptic disasters in its Very Serious history of
the future.</p>

<p>I had had whole paragraphs mapped out in my mind about how yes, the insistence
of 90’s cyberpunk RPGs in inserting these catastrophes was kinda silly. About
how they probably had their roots in their authors believing in that “end of
history” bullshit just as hard as the text of Transhuman Space itself did, and
how they couldn’t see the future being a shitty place if there wasn’t a plague,
a nuclear meltdown, or a big war somewhere in there to muck things up.</p>

<p>It was going to end with an assertion that no, you don’t need a big, clear,
forced disaster to head down a bad path. A lot of those cyberpunk tropes (evil
corporations, authoritarian governments disguised as democracies, and so on)
happened all on their own without needing such a push. William Gibson’s concept
of the Jackpot, presented in his novel <em>The Peripheral</em>, encapsulates all of
this a lot better than Transhuman Space’s bright future. Well, he is William
friggin’ Gibson, and he had almost twenty extra years of history to look at, but
still.</p>

<p>That post is all ruined now, of course, because it turns out those
disaster-licious 90’s games were on to something after all. Here we are, amid a
deadly pandemic that’s causing an untold number of tragedies and turning whole
societies upside-down as enforced quarantines and lockdowns push them to change
their habits in a rush. It’s not nearly as bad as a genuine 90’s RPG disaster,
but, in true Jackpot fashion, it doesn’t have to be. It’s not the <em>cause</em> of the
evil corps’ and authoritarian governments’ rise to power, but a <em>consequence</em> of
it. And I don’t think either THS or the 90’s games would ever have predicted
that rich capitalists would, when faced with a plague, suggest that it was OK to
let vast numbers of people die from it as long as it kept the economy
growing. THS has far too much faith in its Very Smart Neoliberals to suggest
such a thing, and it sounds too bleak even for a 90’s-style dystopia.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>In Greek mythology, Lamia was a woman cursed by Hera to become a half-human,
half-snake, child-eating monster. The Greeks themselves would end up using the
name for a whole species of such creatures later on, and a few naughty anime
shows would end up adopting it for their own brand of snake lady.</p>

<p>D&amp;D lamias are a bit different, and have been in the game since at least 1st
Edition. Here, they are only present in the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>It looks like 1e Lamias were a bit closer to the original myth in that they were
creatures with the upper bodies of women and the lower bodies of beasts. In 4e
they’re a type of fey whose true form is that of a swarm of large black scarabs
wrapped around a skeleton, but who can disguise itself as an attractive
humanoid.</p>

<p>D&amp;D lamias are not very nice. They eat people, using their disguise ability to
lure them to their deaths. Some of them also seek to gain arcane power “by any
means necessary”. Every person they eat adds another beetle to the swarm, and
when the swarm grows too large a lamia reproduces by slaying a “worthy fey” such
as a powerful eladrin and injecting half its beetles into the corpse. Once the
bugs finish eating the victim’s flesh, they rise as a new lamia that shares most
of the victim’s memories and knowledge.</p>

<p>In short, they’re fey nightmare monsters.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>There’s a single lamia stat block. It’s a Medium Fey Magical Beast
(shapechanger), and a Level 12 Elite Controller with 244 HP. It has land and
climb speeds of 6 and trained Perception, though no supernatural senses for
seeing in the dark. Their other trained skills are Arcana, Bluff, and Insight.</p>

<p>Lamias are effectively swarms! They take half damage from melee and ranged
attacks, and 10 extra damage from close and area ones. They also have a
<strong>Swarm’s Embrace</strong> aura 1 that deals damage to any enemies that start their
turns inside.</p>

<p>The way a lamia kills you is by using its <strong>Change Shape</strong> ability to look like
a pretty girl/boy/other and lure you into favorable ambush terrain with a
convincing sob story. Once the group is packed nice and tight, it will release a
psychic <strong>Pacifying Burst</strong> (close burst 5 vs. Will; recharge 5-6), which does
no damage and stuns on a hit (save ends).</p>

<p>Once everyone is nice and stunned the lamia will cover one of the victims in
part of its scarab mass in a <strong>Devouring Swarm</strong> attack (Reach 5 vs. Fortitude),
which does physical damage on a hit and allows the monster to sustain the effect
as a minor action to deal the same amount of automatic damage every turn. The
only way to escape is to move beyond the power’s maximum range, which you can’t
do if you’re stunned.</p>

<p>If anyone resists the initial burst, or of they recover early, the lamia can hit
them with its <strong>Cursed Touch</strong>, a basic attack against Fortitude that heals the
monster for the same amount of damage caused on the victim. It also dazes on a
hit (save ends).</p>

<p>If all else fails there’s the <strong>Squeezing Swarm</strong> trait, which allows the lamia
to squeeze through narrow openings as if it was a Tiny creature, likely by
disassembling into a bunch of individual beetles.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The book says lamias often enslave weaker creatures to serve as
bodyguards. Though their stat blocks don’t have powers that allow them to
dominate others in combat, it’s quite possible they know custom rituals that
allow for long-term mind control, or just use good old-fashioned mundane
intimidation and cruelty.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 12: a lamia, 2 mezzodemons, and 4 cyclops
guards. As this shows, they might also just know enough magic to summon some
demons as muscle.</p>

<p>Lamias are mechanically interesting, though if you dislike the “comely
seductress that actually wants to kill you” trope they might not be your cup of
tea. Their knowledge of magic could allow them to fulfill the same dramatic
roles as hags, but as written they seem a bit too overtly hostile for that.</p>

<p>Kuo-Tua are one of the ten or so kinds of fish-people who have graced D&amp;D’s
bestiaries over its history. The first time they appeared on a core monster book
was in AD&amp;D 2nd Edition, but I guess they must show up in a 1st edition
supplement somewhere. They appear on the Monster Manual and get a Monster
Vault-style update in Dungeon 193.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Kuo-Toa are “loathsome fish-people” who live in the lakes and seas of the
Underdark, where they worship sinister alien gods. They build shrines on the
margins of these watery bodies, and their settlements around these shrines.</p>

<p>Kuo-Toa think little of other sapients, viewing them as potential slaves or
sacrifices. They’re led by their priestly caste, whose members are known as
“whips”. There’s also an elite warrior caste who serves and protects the whips,
and whose members are known as “monitors”.</p>

<p>Whips and monitors lord over the general kuo-toa populace, but they also watch
them closely. You see, they’re very succeptible to the sort of dangerous
destructive madness that often afflicts those who spend too much time
worshipping Lovecraftian entities. Whips and monitors practice mental
disciplines that (mostly) protect them from this, but for some reason these
aren’t shared with the commoners. There’s more than one story about a kuo-toa
village that’s been destroyed by its own inhabitants in a frenzy of senseless
violence.</p>

<p>This entry doesn’t say much about who these sinister gods are, but kuo-toa are
right at the level range for being aboleth servitors and the sample encounters
in both entries bear this out. So it’s quite possible they worship the aboleths
themselves, or see them as avatars of whatever chtonic deity they cults are
centered around.</p>

<p>Kuo-Toa: for all your fishy cultist needs! Also the Underdark has actual seas,
which is awesome.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As inhabitants of the medium-to-deep Underdark, kuo-toa levels cluster around
the mid-Paragon tier. They’re all Medium Natural Humanoids with the Aquatic
keyword plus land and swim speeds of 6. They also have Darkvision.</p>

<p>Their signature power is <strong>Slick Maneuver</strong>, a move action that’s rather
confusingly worded in the MM. The text makes me think they can spend a move
action to essentially slide an ally 1 square around an enemy. The updated
version is a lot cleader: a kuo-toa adjacent to an enemy can spend a move action
to shift 3 squares to another square adjacent to that enemy. They’re slippery
and can give you the run-around, clearing the way for their buddies to close in
and surround you.</p>

<p>Other than that, the only change between versions is the fixed damage. If you
have Dungeon 193, you can go ahead and use the kuo-toa there without losing
anything. Otherwise, update their damage and use the new version of Slick
Maneuver and you should be good to go.</p>

<h3 id="kuo-toa-guard">Kuo-Toa Guard</h3>

<p>This is a Level 16 Minion who I think is meant to be a Skirmisher. It wears
leather, fights with a shield and spear, and its only special trick is Slick
Maneuver.</p>

<p>They fight to the death when in the presence of a strong leader, but run away
immediately if the leader dies before they do.</p>

<h3 id="kuo-tua-marauder">Kuo-Tua Marauder</h3>

<p>This Level 12 Skirmisher has 119 HP and the same gear as a guard. It also covers
its shield in slime!</p>

<p>Its basic melee attack is a <strong>Skewering Spear</strong> that does the usual physical
damage, plus ongoing damage on a hit (save ends). When missed by a melee attack,
the marauder can bash with its <strong>Sticky Shield</strong> as a reaction (vs. Reflex). A
hit does no damage, but it disarms the target!</p>

<p>While bloodied, marauders can use <strong>Quick Step</strong> to shift as a minor action, and
they also have the standard Slick Maneuver.</p>

<p>That’s more mechanical flavor than I expected!</p>

<h3 id="kuo-toa-harpooner">Kuo-Toa Harpooner</h3>

<p>This Level 14 Soldier has 137 HP and trades the standard spear for a harpoon.</p>

<p>The basic <strong>Harpoon</strong> attack also grabs on a hit, and deals 5 ongoing damage
until the target escapes. The harpooner can’t use the weapon on anyone else
while the grab continues.</p>

<p>The weapon can also be thrown in a <strong>Reeling Harpoon</strong> attack (Ranged 5/10
vs. AC), which does the same damage as a melee hit and allows a secondary attack
against Fortitude. A hit here does more damage and pulls the target 3 squares.</p>

<p>Harpooners have the same slimy, sticky shields as marauders, as well as Slick
Maneuver.</p>

<h3 id="kuo-toa-monitor">Kuo-Toa Monitor</h3>

<p>Smarter and stronger than their plebeian compatriots, Monitors use crossbows to
fight at range and unarmed combat to pound fools into submission up close. They
are Level 16 Skirmishers with 153 HP.</p>

<p>The monitor’s basic melee attack is a respectable slam, and their ranged attack
a crossbow shot. They can also use a <strong>Leap Kick</strong> as a standard action, which
allows them to shift 2 squares before making a slam attack.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, they can use their ultimate technique: <strong>Lightning Fist</strong>
targets Reflex and does a goodly amount of lightning damage with a stun rider
(save ends). They keep this in reserve until they have combat advantage over a
target. Slick Maneuver rounds out their repertoire.</p>

<h3 id="kuo-toa-whip">Kuo-Toa Whip</h3>

<p>These priests are Level 16 Controllers with 156 HP. They wield pincer staffs in
combat, and also cast spells.</p>

<p>The <strong>Pincer Staff</strong> is a Reach 2 exotic weapon whose strikes do damage and grab
the target, who takes 1d10 damage every time the whip sustains the grab. This is
a little better than the flat ongoing damage of the harpooner. Instead of
sustaining the grab, the whip can slide the target to any square within staff
reach and release them.</p>

<p>Whips fight at range with <strong>Lightning Strike</strong> spells (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex)
which do lightning damage and blind the target for a turn. Once per encounter
they can summon a <strong>Slime Vortex</strong> (Area Burst 4 within vs. Fortitude; enemies
only) that’s likely to do a whole bunch of unpleasant stuff to its victims.</p>

<p>A hit from the vortex does damage, inflicts a -2 attack penalty for a turn,
slides 3 squares, and knocks prone. A miss inflicts half damage and slides 1
square. Cast this spell and watch as the whole battle turns into a Three Stooges
skit.</p>

<p>Slick Maneuver rounds out their arsenal.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two encounters here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 12: 3 marauders and 1 foulspawn hulk.</li>
  <li>Level 18: 2 monitors, 4 guards, 1 aboleth overseer and 8 aboleth servitors. A
slave-catching party.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a sentence saying sometimes kuo-toa escape this cultish existence and
become mercenaries or even leaders in other Underdark communities.</p>

<p>I think 4e has done a lot of good for these fishy cultists. My memories of them
from 3e were just another type of “fish person with spear”, with little to
distinguish them from locatah or saguahin. Sahuagin are also present in the MM,
so when we get there we’ll see how unique each of them really is.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>I first read about kruthiks in 4e itself, though I think they might have been
introduced in 3e. Here, they’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Kruthiks are dangerous and clever predators that hunt in packs and live in
hives. They resemble big pointy four-legged bugs, but are actually reptiles
beneath those chitin plates.</p>

<p>These beasts were created by the ancient tiefling empire of Bael Turath, which
mutated “wordly reptiles” (likely drakes) through infernal magic in order to
turn them into bioweapons capable of infiltrating enemy camps and fortifications
by burrowing underneath them. It’s likely they had means of controlling kruthiks
back them, but those have been lost to time.</p>

<p>Kruthiks install their hives in large subterranean caves, either natural or dug
out by the monsters themselves. The tunnels they dig are stable, so kruthik
territory will be completely riddled with them. It wouldn’t be uncommon for
these caves and tunnel networks to extend into the “shallow” Underdark.</p>

<p>A kruthik hive will methodically hunt all available prey in the region and then
move or expand somewhere else. Kruthiks butcher their kills and carry the meat
and any treasure back to their hives, and they can communicate through a series
of clicks and insectile buzzing sounds. They also associate the smell of their
own dead with danger, so killing a bunch of them is a way to get the rest of the
hive to move away.</p>

<p>A kruthik undergoes metamorphosis several times over its life, but all of its
forms are dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Kruthiks are Natural Beasts of varying size, with the Reptile keyword. They have
low-light vision and tremorsense, and have land, climb, and burrow speeds,
though that last one tends to be lower.</p>

<p>Their signature trait is <strong>Gnashing Horde</strong>, an aura 1 that deals 2 damage to
any enemy that ends their turn inside. This stacks: if you’re inside multiple
auras, you take damage from all of them.</p>

<h3 id="kruthik-hatchling">Kruthik Hatchling</h3>

<p>Hatchlings are Small, Level 2 Minions. They run and climb at speed 8, and burrow
at speed 2. They only attack with a basic bite and Gnashing Horde, but you can
expect a lot of them (and a lot of pre-dug tunnels) if you breach a kruthik
hive.</p>

<h3 id="kruthik-young">Kruthik Young</h3>

<p>Slightly older, nonminion versions of the hatchling. These are still Small, but
they’re Level 2 Brutes with 43 HP. Their speeds are the same as that of the
hatchlings, and their bites do full damage.</p>

<h3 id="kruthik-adult">Kruthik Adult</h3>

<p>Adults are Medium size, and Level 4 Brutes with 67 HP. Their greater size makes
them a bit slower, with a running and climbing speed of 6, but they burrow
better with speed 3.</p>

<p>Adults keep the Gnashing Horde aura, but their main attack is now their pointy
claws. They can also launch <strong>Toxic Spikes</strong> from their body at up to 2
simultaneous targets (Ranged 5 vs. AC; recharge 5-6). A hit from these does
immediate physical damage, ongoing poison damage, and slows (save ends both).</p>

<p>They’re basically a larger and stronger version of the young, but the spikes are
a nice addition and a nice surprise for unfamiliar PCs.</p>

<h3 id="kruthik-hive-lord">Kruthik Hive Lord</h3>

<p>Though kruthiks are animals they display some instinctive organization, and hive
lords are at the top of the heap. Some times, an adult will undergo a second
metamorphosis into one of these.</p>

<p>Hive lords grow to size Large, and are Level 6 Elite Controllers (Leaders) with
148 HP. The Gnashing Horde aura is replaced with <strong>Hive Frenzy</strong>, an aura 2 that
makes any kruthik inside deal double damage with its basic attacks. This
actually takes them from “slightly weak” to “noticeably stronger” when compared
to the updated average damage for their level. You might want to replace this
with a flat +5 bonus if you fix base kruthik damage, which should lead you to
the same end result. Hive Lords are as fast as adults.</p>

<p>A hive lord’s claw attack remains a bit too weak for its level, and doesn’t
benefit from the lord’s own aura. It can also spray victims with an at-will
<strong>Acid Blast</strong> (Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude; Enemies only), which does immediate
and ongoing acid damage and weakens on a hit (save ends both).</p>

<p>The little tactics paragraph says hive lords open with an acid blast and switch
to claw attacks, but there’s no reason not to spam the blast if you’re so
inclined. In either case, they should keep as many fellow kruthiks in their aura
as possible.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounters are what you’d expect: lots and lots of kruthiks in
different combinations. One of them includes a couple of zombies, though, which
is interesting. Perhaps they don’t eat undead flesh.</p>

<p>Not only had I never heard of kruthiks before 4e, my first contact with them was
actually in Keep on the Shadowfell or another low-level adventure that came out
before the Monster Manual. The text on those adventures just expected me to know
what these things were, so the first time I actually saw a picture of one was
when I first read this entry.</p>

<p>They work well enough mechanically, but I don’t remember seeing them used as
anything other than a single encounter off to one side of the dungeon in these
published adventures. Perhaps this led to them not being very popular. Reading
the lore makes me think you could make a “kruthik apocalypse” scenario instead
of using the usual zombies, though you’d probably need to come up with more
varieties of the beasts (like skirmishers and artillery) to keep things varied.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>From what I’ve observed of the “Old School Renaissance” movement, it can be
divided into two main categories. You have the “Reenactment” group, and the
“Avant-Garde” group.</p>

<p>The Reenactors are people who focus on old editions of D&amp;D. They research
historical documents to learn how Gary Gygax and his group played, in order to
glean all of the assumptions he thought were so obvious he never put to
paper. They play those old editions, and write new material for them. They write
and buy retro-clones, which are either old editions of D&amp;D in different trade
dress, or new games that attempt to precisely replicate the <em>feel</em> of old D&amp;D
without using the same rules.</p>

<p>The Artistes of the Avant-Garde category are people who looked at these
retro-clones and realized that they were always free to write their own games
set in their own weird settings without having to conform to tropes set by some
guy in the 70’s. Perhaps they had already been doing that privately, perhaps
not. But what the existence of these retro-clones did was give then a commercial
platform for their personal weirdness. They could just slap a set of vaguely
Basic D&amp;D-ish rules on something, call it an OSR supplement, and earn an
audience who was suddenly very interested in anything bearing that logo.</p>

<p>Troika: Numinous Edition is very much an Avant-Garde game, though its only real
link to anything D&amp;D is in its high concept. This is “The World’s Most Popular
Fantasy Roleplaying Game”… from another world.</p>

<p>The art style is what first caught my eye in some advertising banners I saw on
RPG.net. The core book was a bit too expensive for me given the current BRL/USD
exchange rate, but fortunately it came with the <a href="https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality">Itch.io Bundle For Racial
Justice and Equality</a>, so I gave it a read.</p>

<p>The cover is quite trippy, and the internal layout gives the pages a pleasant
cream background color, wide margins, and single-color text in a font that’s
readable enough and is apparently meant to look type-written, as if you were
reading a zine. The style for the internal art is equally trippy, and done in
that mock-woodcut style in blacks, reds, yellows and blues.</p>

<p>The system is simple, and uses only six-sided dice. Characters have three main
stats: Skill is what you test to do things; Stamina acts as both your health and
your magic points; and Luck is what you use for “saving throws” and other
similar tests. You determine them all randomly, and then roll on a big d66 table
to add a background on top of that, which gives you additional specialized
skills and some starting gear.</p>

<p>Combat is an opposed test of skill. Whoever rolls highest gets to deal damage,
no matter who it was who initiated the attack. Monsters can have multiple
actions, and PCs can only ever have one per round, but a skilled and lucky PC
can still end up damaging a lot of enemies over the course of that round. The
damage roll is always a single d6, which you then cross-reference with a weapon
table at the start of the book to see how much actual damage you dealt. Three of
the “weapon” entries are “small beast”, “medium beast”, and “large beast”, so
monsters are covered here too.</p>

<p>There’s a sample bestiary with creatures of all types, and it’s easy enough to
come up with your own, since they use the same three stats as PCs.</p>

<p>The setting is an entire psychedelic universe with infinite worlds, through
which you can travel by means that range from spaceships to magical portals (so
yes, you can travel the universe on foot). The archetypes I mentioned above all
seem to be typical inhabitants of the most well-known parts of the universe,
ranging from a civilization of nomadic giants looking for their lost home to an
order of philosophers that voluntarily gave on on their higher brain functions,
and includes other highlights such as stone dwarves that come in well- and
poorly-made versions, several forms of bizarre knightly orders and esoteric
magical traditions, and a catch-all “mysterious foreigner” archetype whose dress
and customs look odd even to this lot.</p>

<p>There’s not really a setting chapter. The basic “science-fantasy universe filled
with portals” description is in the introduction, and most of the rest of the
setting information contained here is in the archetypes. I’m guessing the GM is
meant to come up with their own setting details as needed, and a worked example
of this is in the included adventure, titled “The Blancmange &amp; Thistle”. I don’t
think I like it very much, though.</p>

<p>The Blancmange and Thistle is name of a hotel in the city of Troika. The idea is
that your PC party has just arrived and is looking for accommodation. There’s
only one room left, in the 6th floor, since there’s a festival happening
today. It’s pre-established that all the PCs have agreed to share that room,
strangers though they may be.</p>

<p>And the goal of the adventure is just for the characters to go up to their
room. Only this is written as a linear dungeon crawl sort of thing, where an
incredible amount of concentrated bullshit is thrown at the character’s
direction. They get to choose whether to take the elevator or the stairs. Either
way, at each floor there’s going to be a strange and potentially deadly
encounter, you’re just picking which set you want. The party is not expected to
solve all these encounters with violence, but many of the “peaceful” ones are
still dangerous.</p>

<p>I get it that they’re trying to give us a feel for the type of weirdness you can
find in the setting without describing the setting itself, but this is just too
much, y’know? The poor PCs are just trying to get to their room in an hotel, and
they have to contend with a toxic gaseous life form, a herd of tigers, someone
whose dreams of an infinite abyss leak into reality, a gang of owl hooligans,
ornery mandrill security guards, and so on. All in rapid succession, with little
time to think or recover. There’s no way around any of these things, as all the
encounters happen inside the elevator or in a narrow stairwell. You can switch
from the lift to the stairs and vice-versa, but there’s going to be a random
encounter while you walk through that floor.</p>

<p>You just <em>know</em> that even after the PCs get to their room after the adventure
ends, someone is going to die on the way to the toilet. Probably swallowed by a
drunk sapient black hole who was staying in the next room over and got into the
wrong door by mistake.</p>

<p>I think Troika is a good game on balance. The system is simple, relatively
unobstrusive, and allows for a really wide variety of bizarre characters. The
<em>feel</em> of the setting is great, but the design of the included adventure makes
me feel like the authors were still a bit too attached to the “dungeon crawl”
paradigm. If you do GM it, I would recomment spreading the weirdness out a lot
more, and using it for picaresque adventures that run at a calmer pace than the
frantic “try not die while getting to your hotel room” scenario presented here.</p>
