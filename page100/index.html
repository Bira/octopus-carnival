          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/07/pyramid-2-106.html">A Review of Pyramid #3/106: Dungeon Fantasy</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I’m a little later to this party than I thought I’d be, but here it goes
anyway. <strong>Pyramid #3/106</strong> is the first issue of the magazine to be released
after the completion of the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong>. While the game
itself is still not available to the public at the time of this writing, the
many Kickstarter backers have started receiving their copies. I guess this issue
is meant to both appeal to them and to get other players interested in the
upcoming game.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-it">What’s In It?</h2>

<p>The cover is an illustration from the game itself, depicting an armored knight
and a wizard or druid cautiously advancing through a tunnel whose walls are
covered in glowing sigils. Maybe it’s the style of the knight’s armor, but the
piece gives me a bit of a Dark Souls vibe.</p>

<p>After the usual introductory blurbs about what’s in the issue, we get the first
“real” article: <em>Designer’s Notes</em> for the DFRPG, by Sean Punch himself. It
tells us what it was like to write the game, and gives us an incredibly detailed
account of what’s in each of its books (including the stretch goals and add-ons)
and how that content differs from what’s in the <strong>Basic Set</strong>. If none of the
excellent DFRPG reviews published on the Internet so far have answered all of
your questions about the game, then it might be worth buying this issue for the
six pages of designer’s notes alone - you won’t get a more complete description
without reading the game itself.</p>

<p>Next comes an article on <em>Quick Equipment Kits</em>, by Peter V. Dell’Orto. It has
loadouts in it, which is good because I love loadouts! The article is only four
pages long, so if you <em>don’t</em> love loadouts you can rest assured that this isn’t
reprinting the whole of <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 13</strong> for the new “edition”. This
article leaves weapon and armor selection entirely to players, and instead
focuses on all the <em>other</em> stuff. It has a basic delver package with a minimum
of generally useful gear like ropes and blankets. It then presents a set of
add-ons separated not by character template, but by function within the party:
Cartographer, Door Breaker, Medic, and so on. It also devotes some space to
pre-filled quivers of arrows or bolts, pre-filled bags of sling stones, and bulk
rations of all kinds, which are nifty time-savers all by themselves.</p>

<p>Next comes a whole bunch of <em>Deathtraps</em> by Cristopher R. Rice. While I haven’t
gotten around to reading the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Traps</strong> PDF, I’m told these are
much more cruel than the ones on that book. This makes this a useful tool for
GMs who want to go Gygaxian on their players with false-door crossbow traps or
the Magical Magnetic Murder Machine.</p>

<p>In the Eidetic Memory column, David Pulver talks about <em>Demi-Human
Dungeons</em>. Contrary to what you’d expect from a David Pulver article, there are
no math-intensive rules here. Rather, this is a nice set of guidelines for
designing dungeons built by dwarves, halflings, elves and gnomes. Why would each
of these peoples build a large underground complex? What would they use it for?
How can it fall into ruin and be infested by monsters, and what treasure would
be left behind? Given that the implied Dungeon Fantasy setting is built on
well-worn cliches, the answers will probably not come as big surprises to
veteran GMs, but the descriptions are clear and filled with interesting
references in their examples. Do you want to know what it would be like to delve
into the shattered ruins of Bag End? Read this.</p>

<p><em>Secrets of the Living Tomb</em> by Steven Marsh details the dungeon from the solo
adventure in Pyramid #3/104 in a GM-friendly format, complete with some
backstory and possible campaign hooks. I only skimmed this one, as I intend to
play the adventure eventually.</p>

<p><em>Undead, Undead Everywhere</em> by Sean Punch gives us six new undead monsters to
play with. You have two new varieties of zombie (drowned and frozen), Swamp
Wisps made of toxic gas, and Mummies which are every bit as dangerous as their
OD&amp;D counterparts. There’s also a couple of more exotic selections in the Herd
Horrors and the Tomb Trees. The Mummies and the two “exotics” were by far the
most interesting ones to me, though I liked all of them because you can never
have enough monsters.</p>

<p><em>The State of the Dungeon</em> is a short update on where in the official release
process the game is. It’s close to the end, but not there yet. It does focus
more on the physical product, which makes me think widely available PDF versions
might take a while longer than that to show up, if they do at all. Personally, I
would like to see them earlier rather than later. I already have mine, but I
want something to link to people who are averse to shipping charges.</p>

<p>We end with a <em>Random Thought Table</em> by Steven Marsh on simplifying things to
ease players into the Dungeon Fantasy RPG. It’s mainly a big old plug for the
<strong>Delvers To Go!</strong> supplement, but some of the suggestions here are also
interesting.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-think-of-it">What Do I Think of It?</h2>

<p>Overall, I quite liked this issue, and found it to be worth the price. My
personal favorites were <em>Quick Equipment Kits</em> and <em>Undead, Undead Everywhere</em>,
with <em>Demi-Human Dungeons</em> coming in close behind.</p>

            <p>Looks like my “real-time” gaming group liked the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/08/08/planet-mercenary-actual-play.html">first session</a> of the
Damaxuri Deception so much that they decided to alternate between D&amp;D 5th
Edition and Planet Mercenary until we’re done with it. This made me quite happy,
because I missed being the GM and the system is quite fun. Descriptions for our
cast of player characters can be found <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/08/07/planet-mercenary-actual-play.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rumble-at-the-warehouse">Rumble at the Warehouse</h2>

<p>When we last left Skynet’s Avengers, they had just defeated a bunch of Kostavi’s
thugs guarding a fake hideout, and interrogated the survivor before leaving the
scene of the fight. The guy told them Kostavi had holed up in <em>another</em>
abandoned warehouse with a small army of henchthings. This other warehouse had a
cargo elevator that led right into the building from the spaceport on the
surface.</p>

<p>The party figured that if they were the ones hiding, they would play to use the
shaft as an escape route. After arguing about it for a while they came up with
the following plan: Rufus and his fireteam would go topside and infiltrate the
warehouse through the elevator shaft, while the rest of the company performed a
frontal assault on the warehouse. This would trap the enemies inside and give
the Avengers an edge in the fight.</p>

<p>There was one small wrinkle in that plan: the elevator door was locked! It had a
big “Out of Order” sign on it, behind which hid a fairly sophisticated lock. The
PCs would need to hack that lock or find another way to open the door.</p>

<p>So Orangus decided he would build a bomb. He didn’t have any boomex, and the
company had no money with which to buy some, so he used household chemicals,
random debris and a large trash can to build a home-brewed monstrosity. He
succeeded by just enough to build <em>something</em>, drew the “Spit, Balling Wire and
Brass Ball Bearings” Mayhem card, and succeeded in the Engineering roll it asked
for despite not having the skill. The effect of that of course went into the
bomb, which I ruled was what allowed it to breach the door when it went off.</p>

<p>With the bomb in place, they split up according to the plan, and begun the
assault. Kostavi’s hideout was protected on the outside by a pair of minigun
drones disguised as trash cans, and once the shooting started someone fired a
rocket through the door from within, nearly missing Orangus.</p>

<p>It’s here that the party was formally introduced to what I call the Powered
Armor Conundrum. Heavy armor in <strong>Planet Mercenary</strong> has 1 Hull Point, making it
equivalent to an armored vehicle. This means it and its wearer can only be hurt
by anti-vehicular weapons. However, even one hit by such a weapon will destroy
the <em>ruinously expensive</em> suit, which means PCs wearing the best armor are the
ones most afraid of being hit in any fight involving heavy weapons. Such as this
one.</p>

<p>Aside from the two drones, Kostavi had four goon squads inside the warehouse,
hiding amongst piles of containers arranged to serve as cover. I ruled one of
these had rocket launchers - they’d still do the damage listed in their basic
stat block, but that damage would have the Anti-Vehicular Payload tag. That
prevented Orangus from running amok without fear of being hit.</p>

<p>Kostavi herself was in a suit of flying powered armor equipped with a rocket
launcher and plasma cannon, in addition to a Goaltender drone. She fought openly
until Orangus managed to tag her with a plasma bolt and destroy her armor. From
that point on, her tactic consisted of hiding and sneaking around the warehouse
while her goons distracted the PCs, taking every opportunity to snipe at the
geatest threats. When Rufus revealed himself, it became obvious that the
greatest threat was <em>him</em>, since he was blocking Kostavi’s retreat.</p>

<p>Kostavi broadcast that she had a bomb tied to a heart monitor, and would
manually detonate it unless the PCs stood down and let her leave. The PCs called
her bluff and kept fighting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I never managed to hit anyone with a heavy weapon - the players
wisely began to use one action each turn to dodge, and kept rolling well on
those attempts. Some of the more lightly armored characters did get hit. I told
them how much damage they would suffer and gave them a chance to spend a RiPP on
Ablative Meat, which meant that the rule got used fairly often. Thus did poor
Jonas from the grunt pool meet his death in battle. Other uses of the rule
caused one Leto’s Joy clones to be named Joy Katislene<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and Rufus to remind
me that he named most of his fireteam after the cast of Avatar: The Last
Airbender.</p>

<p>Rufus was in a particularly bad position here because a lot of enemies were
targetting him, and I ruled that since he on the opposite side of the
battlefield from most of the company he didn’t have access to the Grunt Pool for
Ablative Meat purposes. He also didn’t remember to dodge in the first few
rounds. Fortunately, his grunts were lucky, and would survive to complain about
him another day.</p>

<p>Soon the party began to spend more actions looking for Kostavi in the middle of
the fight than actually fighting! The problem here was that only Orangus and Max
had even middling Perception, and she had a Stealth of 11 and rolled really
well.</p>

<p>Orangus decides he’s going to end this swiftly by finding the best place to
plant a bomb on this building and doing that. He not only found the perfect
spot, but also found that someone had already planted a bomb there. A <em>nuclear</em>
bomb. That bluff wasn’t quite as bluffy as they thought!</p>

<p>Orangus recognizes the device as an Urthreep Industries Dial-a-Yield, which is
currently set to something equivalent to 1 ton of TNT. He decides to disarm it
right then and there, and between his high Demolitions skill, his specialty in
Disarming and generous RiPP expenditure, manages to roll a 23. The bomb is
deactivated!</p>

<p>Kostavi still eludes them for a while longer. Finally I turn to Leto, whose turn
it was at the time:</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: Pay me one RiPP and I’ll let you find Kostavi.</p>

<p>So Leto spots her hiding out aways from the main body of the fight, lining up
another shot, and communicates her location to the company. Rufus leaves his
position to charge hers, and attempts to subdue Kostavi in unarmed combat. She
nimbly dodges away and shoots him point-blank with a plasma cannon.</p>

<p>Now, some time before the fight started, Rufus had drawn the “Oh Captain, My
Captain” Mayhem card. This card can be invoked when the PC in question is about
to take damage and has the effect of applying the damage to the Captain instead,
essentially using them as free Ablative Meat for that attack.</p>

<p>I initially considered voiding the card, since the company Captain is Skynet,
which is also <em>their ship</em>. Then I decided I would come up with something if the
card came into play, and told him to keep it. Since Rufus was more afraid of
losing his extremely pricey EX Supersuit than of losing his captain, he used the
card when Kostavi hit him.</p>

<p>This means that the sound of an explosion was heard over the company comms, and
Skynet cooly ordered them to finish that firefight already and come help her
repel these pesky boarders. So yeah, Rufus was safe but the Captain took a hit.</p>

<p>The fight did end soon after that, when Leto attempted to charge Kostavi and
melee her. He had a Melee of 1, she had a Defense of 18, he rolled a
natural 17. Leto does a fixed 11 damage with his claws, which left Kostavi with
1 hp. I ruled she had been squashed like a bug and was unconscious.</p>

<p>Leto broadcasts to the enemies that he has their boss and that if they don’t
stand down he’ll finish her off and make the bomb explode. The bomb in question
has been very publically disarmed, so I he rolls Bluff to make the threat
stick. It turns out Kostavi is so underhanded her goons are ready to believe she
had another bomb hidden somewhere. They drop their weapons and surrender. The
party lets them leave, since they claim they were just hired muscle and that’s
something they can empathize with. Their stuff stays, of course.</p>

<h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s All, Folks!</h2>

<p>And that’s where we stopped the session, since we were out of time. The party
has to take the unconscious Kostavi to the authorities without getting
implicated in the many shootouts and explosions they engaged in, and now they
also have the matter of the boarders currently trying to enter their ship<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Who are these boarders? I don’t know yet! We are entering uncharted territory
here, since that bit isn’t in the published adventure. I have two weeks to come
up with them.</p>

<p>This session was a little more “rules-intensive” from my point of view, which
left less space for levity. The players, however, told me they found it even
more fun than the first session, so I’m happy. I discovered I was operating
under a slight misconception regarding Mayhem: only <em>players</em> draw Mayhem cards,
and only when the test in question <em>succeeds</em>. Before this, they managed to turn
at least one failure into a success due to a serendipitous Mayhem draw.</p>

<p>For the next session I’ll also refresh my memory on how goon squads work - for
this fight, I ruled that a non-area-effect attack would kill at most one
individual in the squad, so even though the goons only had 2hp apiece it took 3
successful attacks to take the whole squad out. It made them a suitable threat
for the players and their up-gunned fireteams.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/08/30/agnostic-dungeon-fantasy.html">Agnostic Dungeon Fantasy</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> follows a pretty traditional split for
its magic. Wizards can do almost everything, but healing and other related magic
are the sole province of clerics, who in turn get their spells from the
gods. Druids also have their own “turf” staked out, receiving their powers from
the might of Nature. This, of course, means that in your typical Dungeon Fantasy
setting the gods are real and Nature as a whole is itself a sort of deity.</p>

<p>That’s not a problem for groups who want to play in the game’s implied setting,
or in an established setting that follows the same conventions. On the contrary,
it makes playing in those worlds very straightforward!</p>

<p>However, not all settings follow these conventions. One popular example is
Thedas, the setting of the <em>Dragon Age</em> games. Another is the world of <em>Dragon’s
Dogma</em>, which I have been covering <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">in some detail</a> on this blog. Though
faith and religion are prominent themes in these worlds, priests don’t gain any
supernatural powers from their deities. In fact, the very existence of the gods
is a matter of, well, faith. All magic is wizardly in nature, even spells that
deal with healing or with plants and animals.</p>

<p>Even some D&amp;D settings take a similar approach. Eberron still restricts access
to healing magic to “divine” characters, but their powers come from specialized
training rather than being granted through prayer. Does the training put clerics
in direct contact with their gods, or is it just a specialized form of wizardry?
Once again, it’s a matter of faith.</p>

<p>And then there’s <em>Final Fantasy</em>, a series that does its own thing by having
very present “god-like” entities in each of its games yet stating that the magic
traditionally associated with clerics is wielded by especially trained wizards
that don’t necessarily have any relation to those entities.</p>

<p>GMs who want to use <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> to run a campaign in one of those
settings, or in a home-brewed setting following similar themes, need to do a bit
of work. I’ve included several suggestions on how to do it below.</p>

<h2 id="first-step-clerics-are-wizards">First Step: Clerics are Wizards</h2>

<p>In an “agnostic” <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> setting, all magic is wizardly! Neither
type of Power Investiture exists. Druids and clerics rely on Magery instead. In
effect, they are wizards who underwent somewhat different training.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The “set” advantages in the Cleric template become Clerical Investment {5} and
Magery 3 {35}, leaving 40 discretionary points for advantages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The “set” advantages in the Druid template become Green Thumb 1 {5} and Magery
3 {35}, leaving 35 discretionary points for advantages.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This step is the same no matter what other decisions you make for the campaign.</p>

<h2 id="second-step-spells">Second Step: Spells</h2>

<p>Since everyone is a wizard, everyone draws from the same spell list! This list
should include all the spells that were previously forbidden to wizards, since
that particular kind of niche protection is now unnecessary. All former clerical
and druidic spells rely on mana, and are affected by the same countermeasures as
wizardly spells.</p>

<p>If you’re using the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> boxed set, this presents a bit of a
problem. Wizardly spells have complex prerequisite chains, while the others have
no requirements beyond a certain level of Power Investiture. How to effectively
combine the two? Here are some alternatives:</p>

<h3 id="the-simple-option">The Simple Option</h3>

<p>If you’re trying to learn a spell from the Cleric or Druid lists that isn’t also
on the Wizard list, look up its required level of Power Investiture, and read
that as the required level of Magery for the spell. That is its only
prerequisite! If the spell in question <em>is</em> on the Wizard list, you <em>must</em> use
its standard wizardly prerequisites.</p>

<p>This is a good option for settings like that of <em>Dragon Age</em> or <em>Dragon’s
Dogma</em>, where healing or nature magic is something any wizard can learn.</p>

<h3 id="the-complex-option">The Complex Option</h3>

<p>Under this option, clerics and druids train in exotic styles or wizardry only
taught to members of their church or circle. Record the Cleric’s Magery as
Magery (Holy), and the Druid’s as Magery (Druidic)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. They use their
traditional spell lists and prerequisite structure, though their spells still
count as wizardly and are affected by mana levels and magical countermeasures.</p>

<p>All three spell-casting professions also gain access to the following advantage:</p>

<h4 id="magical-style-familiarity-2-pointslevel">Magical Style Familiarity (2 points/level)</h4>

<p><strong>Prerequisite: Magery (Any) 1+</strong></p>

<p>You have learned the secrets of another magical style. Specify which one
(Wizardly, Holy, or Druidic) when you first buy this advantage. This must
obviously be different from your first style!</p>

<p>You can learn spells from your new style as if you had that style’s Magery at a
level equal to your level in this advantage. You can’t have more levels of this
advantage than you have Magery. When you learn a spell, also write down which
style it is from. Spells learned as part of one style can’t serve as
prerequisites for another!</p>

<p>The GM might ask for a story reason for you to learn this advantage, such as
joining a religious order, druidic circle, or wizard’s guild. If you already
know two styles, you can buy the advantage again to learn the third one!</p>

<p>This is a good option for settings in the vein of Eberron or Final Fantasy,
where the different types of magic are all gained through training but their
practitioners jealously guard their secrets from each other<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="the-expensive-option">The Expensive Option</h3>

<p>Use the prerequisite chains from <strong>GURPS Magic</strong>, which already organizes all of
its spells as if they were wizardly. This is the expensive option because you
would need to acquire the book if you don’t have it already, and using it <em>just</em>
for the prerequisites might be a bit wasteful. It does have a fair number of
spells that aren’t present in the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> boxed set, though those
would need some careful scrutiny before you can let them into your game.</p>

<h2 id="third-step-special-abilities">Third Step: Special Abilities</h2>

<p>Clerical and Druidic magic are more than just spells! Each includes a set of
intrinsic powers bought as advantages, known as Holy Might and Druidic
Arts. They are an important part of these templates, and vital to the Holy
Warrior, who relies entirely on Holy Might instead of spells.</p>

<p>What should we do with them? Once again, there are several options.</p>

<h3 id="the-harsh-option">The Harsh Option</h3>

<p>These abilities simply don’t exist in the setting. Magic means spells,
period. This means that those discretionary points for Druids and Clerics that
don’t go into advantages will go to spells instead, and that the Holy Warrior
template cannot be used as-is in your campaign.</p>

<p>The appropriate template to use in its place depends on what the player’s
central concept is. A warrior who is a member of a Church could be a Knight,
perhaps with Clerical Investment added in. A character who needs to combine
martial prowess with a bit of supernatural help could be a well-armed Cleric who
put a few additional points into ST and weapon skills.</p>

<p>Spell-casting characters can still spend their points on supernatural advantages
permitted to wizards, such as Wild Magic or Improved Magic Resistance.</p>

<p>This is harsh because it significantly cuts down on the number of available
character options! It most resembles the very oldest versions of D&amp;D, which
didn’t have a cleric class. Most other fantasy settings I know of feature at
least some kind of non-spell supernatural power, even if it’s just the ability
to turn undead.</p>

<h3 id="the-cool-option">The Cool Option</h3>

<p>Both Holy Might and Druidic Arts are now considered “wizardly” powers! Magery
becomes the applicable talent for them. Instead of depending on the wielder’s
virtuous conduct or on the strength of Nature, they now depend on <em>mana</em>, just
like spells.</p>

<p>This means they work normally when the mana level is normal or higher. When it’s
low, the character either gets a -5 to any rolls to use the ability, or a 50%
reduction in potency if the ability doesn’t require a roll. In a no mana zone,
they don’t work at all!</p>

<p>The flavor of each ability’s description should change to reflect their new
nature, where appropriate. For example, Holy Might abilities whose descriptions
imply divine guidance would instead be based on divination magic. Where a
specific ability has an effect that overlaps with an existing Wizard power-up,
use the Wizard version instead. This mostly means using Wild Magic
(<strong>Adventurers</strong>, p. 41) instead of Contingency Casting (<strong>Adventurers</strong>,
p. 20).</p>

<p>In a setting where any magician can learn any spell, they can also learn any of
these abilities. In settings that use the Complex option, a character can learn
the abilities for their own “style” and for any other for which they bought
Magical Style Familiarity, with the level of that advantage serving as the
talent for the power. Everyone who would have access to Contingency Casting
still has access to Wild Magic instead without having to pay extra for it.</p>

<p>Mana-based Holy Might abilities <em>don’t</em> go away if their wielder stops behaving
virtuously, which allows for stories where villains hide among the ranks of the
Church, or where the organization itself behaves terribly while claiming virtue
is on their side. These are the hallmark of “grittier” settings like that of
<em>Dragon Age</em>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>By picking one option for spells and one for abilities from the ones outlined
above you would be well on your way to having an “agnostic” Dungeon Fantasy
setting.</p>

<p>For comparison, the Dragon’s Dogma adaptation I’ve been writing on this blog
uses the Expensive option for spells because it predates the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong>
boxed set and assumes the GM will already have <strong>GURPS Magic</strong>. For magical
abilities, it takes an approach similar to the Harsh option but adds a custom
list of power-ups any magical character can learn. It would work just as well
with the Simple and Cool options instead.</p>

            <p>Say you’re a GURPS player who’s inspired to make a dashing pirate, a badass
veteran soldier with a cool eyepatch, or maybe even a cyclops knight. Then you
look up the One Eye disadvantage and notice that it gives you major penalties in
combat.</p>

<p>While this is realistic, the type of story that likely inspired you is quite
cinematic, which makes seeing those penalties a bit disappointing. One-eyed
movie and game protagonists never seem to be inconvenienced by their
disability. In fact, it’s often turned into an asset, as it makes enemies
underestimate them. Here’s a new disadvantage to emulate that.</p>

<h3 id="one-eye-cinematic--5-points">One Eye, Cinematic (-5 points)</h3>

<p>You may have only one eye, but that doesn’t even slow you down! You do not
suffer from the DX and skill penalties from the realistic version of this
advantage, and may generally behave as if you had perfect depth perception and a
full field of view. This is typical of action heroes, and naturally one-eyed
aliens or fantasy creatures.</p>

<p>This is worth points as a disadvantage because you still do have only one eye!
If that eye is crippled, you’re <em>blind</em>. You also suffer any other consequences
that might be attached ot the condition in your setting, such as social
penalties or bonuses for other people to recognize you.</p>

<p>This disadvantage is also still worth points in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong>. Its implied
setting might not attach any social penalties to the condition, but it <em>does</em>
make losing an eye something far more likely to happen than in other settings,
which puts you at an increased risk of going blind.</p>

<p>I’ll begin this review by saying I’m really not the best person to review the
<strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> (DFRPG). It’s not that dislike it: in fact,
I loved it! However, I’m really bad at reading through the text in detail and
spotting all the differences between the game and the GURPS supplements that
originated it. I know these differences exist, and I know they make the game
better, but I’ll probably only internalize them when I reference the text in
play enough times.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it seems I’m late to the party when it comes to reviewing the
<strong>DFRPG</strong>, so I can point you to lots of other reviews by other people who are
better at this than me! Just Roll 3d6 has very detailed reviews of
the <a href="http://justroll3d6.com/dfrpg-review-adventurers/">Adventurers</a> and <a href="http://justroll3d6.com/dfrpg-review-exploits/">Exploits</a> books. <a href="https://pseudoboo.blogspot.com.br/">Let’s GURPS</a> is reviewing all
the recently-released books too. And I’m sure many other reviews will pop up in
time.</p>

<p>What I’ll do in this article is something only I can do: give you my own opinion
on the game. Whether that is of any value is left as an exercise for the
reader.</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

<p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> is my favorite edition of D&amp;D. Go out
and buy it as soon as it comes out.</p>

<h2 id="wait-what">Wait, What?</h2>

<p>Technically, my favorite edition of D&amp;D is 4th, but it occupies that position
for very specific reasons. It allows me to run cool, flashy battles in the style
of turn-based tactical RPGs such as Disgaea, Fire Emblem, or Final Fantasy
Tactics. If I want a campaign that feels like that, I reach for D&amp;D 4.</p>

<p>If I don’t want to run a campaign that feels like that, my tastes get a bit
fiddlier. I will <em>play</em> D&amp;D 5th edition if no other alternative presents itself,
but it doesn’t look very exciting to GM. Earlier editions add to that an
elaborate list of varied complaints that I’m sure anyone familiar with them can
guess, and I’m not one of those enlightened souls who can forget about them for
long enough to enjoy a session.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> has a premise that’s exactly like that
of Basic D&amp;D (one of the most popular OSR darlings), married to a ruleset that
does everything most editions of D&amp;D do in a way I find better. It’s
point-based! It has a unified mechanic! It has a good skill system!
Warrior-types are <em>actually</em> better at combat than spellcasters!</p>

<p>You can of course also run flashy set-piece battles with it, and they’ll tend to
have a feel that’s closer to that of the old-school editions.</p>

<p>It takes all of that from GURPS. Its rules are a specialized version of GURPS
4th Edition, with everything that’s not relevant to dungeon-crawling fantasy
campaigns stripped out and the rest adapted to the purpose. Some parts are
simpler than in the original rules, some are not, but they’re all useful. A lot
of those things which usually lead to heated arguments between players and DMs
are given proper rules and effects here. Want to stab that ogre in the eye?
Perform some unlikely feat of parkour? Check to see if that dead monster has
valuable body parts? The system has you covered.</p>

<p><strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> gives you 11 “professional templates” that are roughly
equivalent to some of the most popular D&amp;D classes, and which can be humans or
one of a selection of 8 racial templates that includes all the usual suspects
plus the Catfolk<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>While the game focuses very heavily on dungeon-delving, it’s certainly possible
to use it for fantasy campaigns that go beyond the dungeon. It has more support
for social interaction than Basic D&amp;D does<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and bringing in more detailed
rules from GURPS is extremely easy, if the GM thinks it’s necessary.</p>

<p>So yes, if I was planning on running a D&amp;D-ish campaign and wasn’t after the
very specific feel of D&amp;D 4 combat, I would use <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> in
preference to any other actual edition of D&amp;D. In fact, I have been doing
just that for years using the previous iteration of these rules, and will gladly
switch to the new one now that I have it in my hands.</p>

<p><strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> isn’t yet available to the public as of this writing, but
the Kickstarter backers have already begun receiving their copies. Both the
printed and PDF versions should appear on <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com">Warehouse 23</a> in October.</p>
