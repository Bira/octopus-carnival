        <title>Let&apos;s Play Hell&apos;s Rebels: Player Character Origins</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell&apos;s_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell’s Rebels includes some traits in its Player’s Guide that can be assigned to
PCs to tie them to the campaign either by providing a motivation or by giving
them additional ways to contribute. A PC could be a minor worker in the opera,
or a fed-up citizen, or interested in the city’s history, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think those quite fit what I have in mind for my solo campaign. They are
suitable as backgrounds for level 1 starting characters and their mechanics can
be useful at the start, but pretty much cease to be a factor in the story once
the “main plot” kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being released six years earlier than Hell’s Rebels, the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/neverwinter/&quot;&gt;Neverwinter
Campaign Setting&lt;/a&gt; for D&amp;amp;D 4e does a much better job at allowing players to
create characters who are &lt;em&gt;deeply&lt;/em&gt; involved with the campaign at hand. More than
starting motivations, its character themes provide entire story arcs that will
remain relevant throughout the entire campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want the same thing for my game, so I’m going to replace the relatively
generic reasons given in the Hell’s Rebels player guide with something that’s
narratively on par with Neverwinter’s themes. I want them to not only be more
exciting, but also to reflect the increased starting power of Dungeon Fantasy
characters. They’re going to be key players in the rebellion from minute one of
the campaign. Why just be a random history buff when you can be The Last
Archivist instead? This status might be reflected in some of their traits, but
the story consequences are the main thing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the “character themes” I intend to use. There are five, one for each of
my intended PCs, but presenting them separately will help provide some
inspiration to other GMs who want to do the same thing whether in GURPS or
another system. I’m using Dungeon Fantasy archetype and ancestry names instead
of those from Pathfinder, but the correlations should be pretty easy to
deduce. Each of them also has plot ties to some of the game’s possible allied
factions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each theme bellow includes a short background description, and paragraphs
listing prerequisites, benefits, and drawbacks. These are mostly story-related,
but they might also add optional mechanical traits to your character’s
template. You can buy these right away with your starting points, or buy them
later with earned points like any other template trait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sixth-raven&quot;&gt;The Sixth Raven&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most surviving historical documents about the Silver Ravens say they were five
in number: Jackdaw the elf swashbuckler, Amyreid the half-elf cleric, Ba the
halfling wizard, Kyda the human bard, and Brakisi the human scout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These documents were wrong. There was one other: you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were a small orphan child then, adopted by the group as a kind of mascot
somewhere along their career. You shared their love for Kintargo and its
freedom, but you were too young to go on any actual adventures, so you mostly
helped by running small errands, and heard from their big battles when they
returned to tell the tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lasted until the last battle, the one against the massed armies of House
Thrune. Jackdaw sent you away with many of her other non-combatant friends the
day before that one, promising she’d call you back when the danger was past. She
never did, because the Ravens lost. Jackdaw surrendered so that the demonic army
would spare the city, and the others were either killed by Thrune agents over in
subsequent years or disappeared forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the following decades you would finally reach adulthood and set out on your
own, becoming an adventurer of some skill and renown elsewhere in the Inner Sea
region. Now, you’re ready to return home and finish the work of your
old friends. Your name has been struck from the history books, but your passion
burns as brightly as it ever did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: You must belong to a species long-lived enough that you could
have been a child 70 years ago and still be of adventuring age in the
present. Being a dwarf or some kind of elf is enough, but the Half-Spirit
ancestries from DF 3 might also fit. Another alternative is to play a
&lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/02/07/warforged-variants.html&quot;&gt;Warforged&lt;/a&gt; who was an &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; member of the Ravens and spent some of the
intervening decades disabled and unconscious, but was recently repaired. You can
belong to any profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: You remember things. The GM might occasionally give you hints and
clues about old Silver Raven safehouses and stashes. You also knew the Ravens
personally and they knew you - should any of them still be around, you will be
able to recognize each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add the Serendipity {15} trait to your template if it’s not already
present. This represents your memories of old Kintargo and Raven hangouts, and
might let you find useful shortcuts, items, and passages that are not
pre-written into the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt;: Things remember you. Demons, vampires, and other similarly
long-lived monsters who faced the original Ravens back in the day will recognize
you just as readily, and will be extra-mean to you as a result. Once word
spreads that you’re back, some of them might even travel to Kintargo for the
sole purpose of killing you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be represented by the Enemy (Monster of the Week, 9 or less) {-15}
trait, which gets added as an optional disadvantage to your template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only have the DFRPG, the disadvantage works like this: the GM rolls 3d6
in secret at the beginning of each adventure or each session of an extended
adventure. If the result is a 9 or less, a significantly powerful monster will
appear somewhere along the coming adventure or session, inserting itself into
one of the upcoming situations and making things more complicated and dangerous
for you and your group. It’s usually something complicated to fight, and not
necessarily the same monster every time. This is &lt;em&gt;in addition&lt;/em&gt; to any
pre-existing monsters in the adventure who recognize you and want you dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-last-archivist&quot;&gt;The Last Archivist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were a member of the Sacred Order of Archivists, a secret society made up of
worshipers of various deities of knowledge and wisdom. The Order was dedicated
to preserving the true history of Kintargo and other such “forbidden” knowledge
from Thrune redactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Order is no more: its hideout was raided and ransacked by Thrune forces
during the Night of Ashes. You were away when it happened, on a mission to
retrieve an important document in another city. That’s why you survived. When
you returned, you reached out to a few contacts and learned that some of your
colleagues have surviving family. They were nobles and their family estate was
razed during the Night of Ashes, but one of their sons is still at large. You
are now trying to find this son, help him stay safe, and then get revenge on
House Thrune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: None! While the Order is an excellent origin for Clerics,
Wizards, and other big brains, it could easily have employed fightier or
sneakier types as security or retrieval specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s impossible to be a member of the Archivists and not learn
&lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. In addition to being familiar with the Order’s hideout and its
procedures, you also know a bit of the region’s unredacted history and a few
other tidbits of unrelated but potentially useful knowledge. You can recognize
the Sixth Raven if run into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add the History and Research skills as an option to your template, and
also all specialties of Hidden Lore if they aren’t there already. You also add
Wild Talent {20} as an optional advantage, representing a large trove of random
knowledge. If you’re using the Basic Set, add Intelligence Analysis to your
template as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt;: You’re riven by grief and driven by revenge against Barzilai
Thrune and his minions. This might manifest as Intolerance (Diabolists) {-5}, an
Obsession (depose Thrune)(12) {-10}, or both! The Obsession might seem redundant
since it’s also the overall campaign goal, but it also compels you to take
potentially risky and unwise courses of action if they seem like they will yield
quicker results. It could also prevent you from retreating from a fight against
Thrune’s minions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;knight-of-the-deep&quot;&gt;Knight of the Deep&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You come from one of the subaquatic communities off the coast of Ravounel, where
you enjoy an heroic reputation. You recently went to visit your friend Aava in
the coastal village of Acisazi, only to find her missing and the village
suffering under a strange malaise. The village’s elder told you Aava had led a
small party of scouts into Kintargo to ask seek help breaking the curse, but she
never reported back. She begged you to find Aava, and you accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You arrive at this land-lubber town to find it embroiled in a lot more trouble
than you thought possible. Aava is nowhere to be found and neither is her
contact, the singer Shensen. You suspect both of them vanished into the prisons
of the despotic Barzilai Thrune, and your queries have led you to the Aria Park
protest. You suspect you might need to bloody this human despot’s nose to
fulfill your mission, and that’s just fine with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: You must belong to a species capable of breathing underwater!
Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level contains two possible choices here: the Sea
Elf and the Water-Infused. From this blog, you might also pick the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html&quot;&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;
or perhaps a &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/02/07/warforged-variants.html&quot;&gt;Warforged&lt;/a&gt; who has been modified to be hydrodynamic and
Amphibious. And of course we also have a whole article about the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2024/04/28/atlantis.html&quot;&gt;Denizens of
the Sea&lt;/a&gt; that also contains a few usable ancestries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theme is open to any profession, but martial types should probably keep in
mind the rules for &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html&quot;&gt;underwater combat for fish-people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: The people of Acisazi know and trust you, and Aava is your good
friend (or even a relative if you’re also a sea elf).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add Swimming, Aquabatics and Survival (Undersea) to your template as
optional skills, and should probably put some points in them during character
creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt;: Add Obsession (find Aava and her scouts) (12) {-5} to your
template as an optional disadvantage. It’s what you already want to do anyway,
but like the Last Archivist’s Obsession it might drive you to unwise actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;phantom-thief&quot;&gt;Phantom Thief&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are one of Lady Docur’s School for Girls’ most distinguished graduates. You
had parted ways with your alma mater and set up shop in nearby Vyre, but a
recent letter from Lady Docur herself brought you back to Kintargo. The city’s
political climate is getting rather inhospitable to the school, and she hopes
you will be able to help them survive these turbulent times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words: the school is currently the closest thing Kintargo has to a
thieves’ guild. They specialize in training secret couriers and the nicer sort
of thief. Thrune prefers the &lt;em&gt;nasty&lt;/em&gt; sort of thief, so things might get
difficult for the school and its students. That’s where you come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you’re not here just to help your old school. You’re also, er, taking
a breather from some rather complex entanglements you left behind in the good
city of Vyre. Hopefully it will be a long while before you have to set foot
there again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s a school for girls, which means you either are a woman
or only discovered you &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; after graduation. You must also be some manner
of Thief, either the base template or one of the variants from the corresponding
Dungeon Fantasy Denizens book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: You know Lady Docur and other characters associated with your alma
mater, and have their trust. You also know Vyre’s customs, which might come in
handy if you ever need to go back there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add Area Knowledge and Current Affairs for both Kintargo and Vyre to your
template, as well as Connoisseur, Savoir-Faire and the Fashion Sense
advantage. The School does give one a proper high society education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt;: Those Vyre entanglements will come back to haunt you if you ever
return there during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No extra disadvantages here: everything which could make a thief’s life harder
is already part of the relevant templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mysterious-satirist&quot;&gt;Mysterious Satirist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before Barzilai Thrune rolled in like he owned the place, you were already
well-known among Kintargo’s rebels, malcontents, and antifascists. Whether you
make poems, plays, essays, or songs, your work criticizing House Thrune was on
everybody’s minds and the pseudonym you chose for yourself was spoken in the
same tones as that of The Poison Pen and other such figures. Thrune’s opponents
speak it with admiration; his supporters, with disgust. That’s how you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no one has figured who you are yet, Barzilai’s arrival and the Night of
Ashes have made your life very difficult already. Most of your contacts among
Kintargo’s several resistance organizations have vanished, left town, or gone to
ground. While you still value your art, you also feel it’s time to engage in
more direct action against this dictator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: None! While Bards obviously have a head start in terms of the
artistic skills implied by this theme, the Mysterious Satirist could be anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: Choose one of the Bellflower Network, the Cult of Sarenrae, the
Rose of Kintargo, or the Poison Pen. You’re indirectly acquainted with that
group or individual. Though you have never met, you have corresponded and set up
pre-arranged signs that will let you recognize each other when the meeting does
happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the artistic or performance skills of your choice to your template, as well
as an appropriate Talent covering them to your optional advantages. Writing,
Poetry, and Musical Composition are appropriate if you share your work through
in written form. Public Speaking, Singing, Acting and Musical Instrument are
also good if you actually perform it. If you have the GURPS Basic Set, you can
also add Artist to the list of possible artistic skills, and you also add
Propaganda no matter what your medium is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt;: Add a 10-point Secret (Mysterious Satirist), Selfless, and
Trickster to your optional disadvantage list if they are not already there. The
first represents the risk of bad things happening when the authorities discover
who you are, above and beyond what being a Silver Raven would bring. The other
two represent possible reasons for you to have chosen this path in the first
place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Play Hell&apos;s Rebels: Adjusting Setting Assumptions</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell&apos;s_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for me to put on my GM hat and begin preparing my solo Hell’s Rebels
campaign. As mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/07/08/lets-play-hells-rebels.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I want to play this using the
GURPS Dungeon Fantasy rule set instead of the campaign’s native Pathfinder
1e. Let’s take a look at what this means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait a minute! Wasn’t that previous most published more than a year ago?
Well, turns out I started writing this one shortly after publishing it, but one
thing and another got in the way and I’m only getting around to publishing it
now. I’m actually a fair bit along in campaign preparation and even started
playing, I’m just behind on documenting the process. Anyway, let’s keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-setting&quot;&gt;The Setting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we all know by now, Hell’s Rebels takes place in Golarion, Pathfinder’s
setting. Golarion was built from the ground up to support dungeon fantasy
campaigns so we don’t have any fundamental friction between it and the Dungeon
Fantasy rules. Despite the many D&amp;amp;D-isms of Pathfinder’s first edition we
already know the setting can easily be used with other systems, since it has an
official Savage Worlds port and Paizo itself is in the process of removing those
D&amp;amp;D-isms from the latest iteration of their house system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I do want to make a few changes to the version I’m going to
use. The most obvious one is I’m going to drop the many different fiend
classifications from D&amp;amp;D and Pathfinder in favor of Dungeon Fantasy’s
simplified “it’s all demons from Hell”. Any of the demons from DF will be fair
game as opposition here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since I’m talking about setting changes, any mention I find of Cheliax’s
fascists and diabolists being in any way “disciplined” or “organized” despite
their evil will be altered because incompetence, corruption, and a disregard for
any rules lies at the heart of fascism. These fucks do not make the trains run
on time and never have. You do not, at any point, gotta hand it to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to lean on the similarities between this campaign and Assassin’s
Creed Brotherhood, so we’ll be at a Renaissance tech level with early guns
widely available to guards and rebels. Make ready your blessed bullets, o devil
hunters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mechanics&quot;&gt;The Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this will mostly be pretty simple, because this won’t be the first time
I’m converting between Pathfinder and DF. I did already run the first two
volumes of Hell’s Rebels and the first three volumes of Iron Gods to different
player groups. During those times two issues jumped at me as being the most
difficult to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one was treasure conversions, but I think I’ve arrived at a satisfying
process for that &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/06/25/dungeon-fantasy-wealth.html&quot;&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;. Our delvers will eventually end up very
wealthy, but I imagine the rebellion will prove to be a great money sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other difficulty concerns the only somewhat common part of the dungeon
delving experience that’s harder to do in Dungeon Fantasy than in D&amp;amp;D:
underwater adventures. There’s a couple of extended underwater segments in the
middle of the adventure path, and Pathfinder’s default items and spells for it
are a lot more accessible than Dungeon Fantasy’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey, it turns out I already solved that too! &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html&quot;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; collects the
underwater rules I’ll be using, and &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/11/13/underwater-items.html&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; has a nice set of more
accessible items to let our PCs go for a swim and live to tell the tale. The
truth is that I started writing this post before I wrote the underwater ones, so
they were actually part of my effort to figure this campaign out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monster conversions used to be a big problem back when I started the Let’s Read,
but now I have enough DF monster books that I can swipe appropriate stat blocks
for nearly every one of them. If I need to create new ones for specific foes,
you can be sure I’ll post them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coming-up-next&quot;&gt;Coming up Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Character themes! Everybody loves character themes!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Denizens of the Sea</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve published an article about &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html&quot;&gt;underwater adventuring&lt;/a&gt; in the past, in
which I mentioned that “fish-people” had several advantages over “land-lubbers”
when it came to mobility and fighting in an underwater environment. A later post
included &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/11/13/underwater-items.html&quot;&gt;a few items&lt;/a&gt; that could help those land-lubbers close the
gap… so how about we take a look at those fish-people now? As a bonus, you get
a nice little bundle of setting info you can drop on your campaign if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fate-of-atlantis&quot;&gt;The Fate of Atlantis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name “Atlantis” figures in the myths and legends of many more places than it
should. Cultures that have never heard of each other have stories about an
empire that ruled the waves in ancient times but no longer exists. The stories
might differ but the name is always the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because ancient Atlantis was the largest and most powerful underwater
civilization to ever exist. They discovered a means of traveling to other worlds
and exploited it with gusto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its power Atlantis eventually fell, as all empires do. The exact
sequence of events is more or less impossible to piece together, and mostly
irrelevant in the present day. The important bit is that their inter-world
travel network was the first thing to go, instantly fragmenting the
empire. That’s why each of them has a different story about how Atlantis fell -
those stories talk only about the bits of it they knew about. In some, it
happened overnight due to a cataclysm. In others, they eventually morphed into
successor cultures that might still be extant in the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from giving rise to a whole bunch of legends and to fueling the occasional
would-be despot’s ambitions, the most enduring legacy of Atlantis was its
underwater engineering. They pioneered a lot of the techniques that used to make
sturdy weapons and tools out of implausible aquatic materials like bone, shell,
coral, and mother-of-pearl. They were also the first civilization to
successfully make and work orichalcum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’re not here to talk about &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;, we’re here to talk about &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-lets-talk-about-people&quot;&gt;So Let’s Talk About People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinions differ on whether Atlantis was a Golden Age utopia or a despotic empire
whose downfall was a blessing to the world, but everyone agrees it was pretty
diverse. Unlike most typical dungeon fantasy kingdoms, its citizens belonged to
many different species with none of them making up an overwhelming majority of
the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of Atlantis’ citizens can be described using already-published stats. Sea
Elves and Water-Infused from GURPS DF 3: The Next Level fit very well, as do the
Argonians from &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. The octopus- and shark-folk from GURPS Banestorm
are also good fits, though they’re a bit more complex and costly than the
standard for DF racial templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are a few new templates, with the overall goal of allowing a diverse
all-underwater party if the group wants to play that type of campaign. A couple
of the new ancestries I present here might have equivalent official templates
already, but since I don’t have those I’m writing new ones for my own use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These templates assume that being Amphibious also makes you able to see and hear
unimpeded while submerged, and the ability to breathe underwater also makes you
able to speak there. I feel this is in line with the simpler feel of Dungeon
Fantasy. If you want to follow Banestorm’s assumptions instead, give all
templates here one level of Nictitating Membrane {1} and Speak Underwater {5},
increasing their costs by 6 points each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;atlantean-20-points&quot;&gt;Atlantean (20 points)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This template describes people who are a product of successive generations of
intermarriage between the other species that made up the population of Atlantis,
and possibly some surfacers too. They are known as “Atlanteans” because their
general look became associated with that empire. Surprisingly, they look a lot
like humans even when they have no humans among their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlanteans are warm-blooded, have legs, and can breathe both water and
air. Their human-looking bits exhibit the same ethnic variety as
humans. Individuals can also have a variable number of “fishy” traits like visible
gills, fins, blue or gray skin, and so on. These might be visually striking but
are never significant enough to count as more than 0-point features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlanteans can appear in worlds that had an Atlantis, or those whose underwater
peoples are generally friendly with each other. The base stats could also be
used as they are or modified a bit to represent any species of underwater
humanoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Amphibious {10}, Gills {10}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Traits&lt;/strong&gt;: Those fishy bits might count as varying levels of Unnatural
Features in a setting where almost everyone is human and the character is the
only known Atlantean, but in all other situations they’re 0-point traits. If the
character has something like rigid fins or a prominent tail growing out of their
lower back, they might need adapted body armor. This doesn’t cost extra, but
might restrict their usage of looted armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crab-folk-40-points&quot;&gt;Crab-Folk (40 points)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crab-folk are sapient humanoid crustaceans easily distinguished by their heavy
segmented carapaces. Like crabs, they lack distinct heads and their eyes are
located at the end of a pair of flexible, retractable stalks. Unlike crabs, they
only have the usual complement of humanoid limbs, though these are still
armored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crab-folk can operate normally on the surface, but their gills begin to dry out
if they go more than a day without being immersed in sea water. This means they
tend to stick close to the coast. Their voices sound strange and “bubbly”
outside the water, which most surfacers find off-putting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: 360-degree Vision {25}; Amphibious {10}; Gills {10}; Damage
Resistance 5 (Cannot Wear Armor) {15}; No Neck {5};&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Cold-Blooded {-5}; Disturbing Voice (In Air, -50%) {-5},
Dependency (Sea water, Daily) {-15}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional Traits&lt;/strong&gt;: If your campaign takes place far from a coastal area, the
Dependency disadvantage is worth -30 points, and the template therefore costs
only 25. Your local alchemist can prepare a solution close enough to seawater to
satisfy the requirement, but it’s still not free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deep-ones-50-points&quot;&gt;Deep Ones (50 points)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These humanoids are much more obviously “fishy” than Atlanteans, with an anatomy
closer to that of an abyssal fish than a human’s. They’re adapted to the
lightless depths of the ocean and that’s where they prefer to make their
homes. Deep Ones can swim up to the shallows without suffering ill effects, but
can’t breathe air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Atlantis fell, it was not uncommon for its Deep One settlements to become
more isolated and break contact with shallower or surface communities. This some
times gave rise to sinister legends and rumors about what they got up to down
there. These are mostly bunk: they are no more prone to worshiping Elder Things
than any other species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Amphibious {10}, Dark Vision {25}, Fangs {2}, Gills {0},
Pressure Support 3 {15}, Tough Skin 1 {3}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Cold-Blooded {-5}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional Traits&lt;/strong&gt;: A variant that can operate on the surface would be closer
to several classic D&amp;amp;D fish-people. They have the 10-point version of Gills and
so cost that much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;merfolk-20-points&quot;&gt;Merfolk (20 points)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merfolk are humanoid from the waist up and have fish bodies from the waist
down. They can breathe both air and water and have naturally melodious voices in
both mediums, but they require magic or assistive devices like wheelchairs to
operate on land. Their human halves display the same variance as Atlanteans, and
their fish halves can resemble a variety of species of fish, shark, or cetacean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Gills {10}, Voice {10}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/strong&gt;: No Legs (Aquatic) {0}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features&lt;/strong&gt;: The “Leg” and “Foot” hit locations on merfolk refer to their tail
and lower fins instead. Armor for those locations must be specially
constructed. As usual this doesn’t cost extra but limits which looted armor they
can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional Traits&lt;/strong&gt;: If your character’s fish half mimics a particularly speedy
species, they might have Enhanced Move 1 (Water) for an extra 20 points. At the
GM’s option, this might be a matter of training instead of biology, which means
any merfolk character can buy this with earned points as a power-up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackaton: Hard Wired Island</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/hard-wired-island-cover.png&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Hard Wired Island&apos;s cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard Wired Island is a cyberpunk game published by Weird Age Games in 2020. It’s
a beefy 400 page tome comparable in size to the Shadowrun or CP RED cores, but
only about 25% of that is rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard Wired Island takes place in Grand Cross, an O’Neil Cylinder habitat
orbiting Earth’s Lagrange 5 point, in the “distant future” of 2020. It was built
according to an idealistic plan in the wake of terrible environmental and
economic disasters on Earth, but is currently in the process of being co-opted
and corrupted by the interests of ultra-rich corporations and elites. The way in
which this is happening is described in very realistic detail throughout the
book, which also talks a bit about what people do to fight back. PCs are usually
expected to help in that fight, if not for moral reasons then because those
billionaires cause constant economic shocks that threaten their survival. This
is the main conflict in the setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grand Cross has cybernetic implants, gene editing, fully sapient AI and
androids. However its “global net” is still pretty much the internet
of 2020. It’s even &lt;em&gt;named&lt;/em&gt; “the internet”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every building in the station is wired for high-speed internet. The airwaves are
serviced by cell carriers like the ones you know from the real world, and some
of its wards even have free public wi-fi, though that tends to be poor quality
because capitalism is the worst virus. The station is linked to Earth’s internet
by satellites, with a 1.2-second lag there due to the physical distances
involved. Most big services have station-local data centers to try and get
around this, and there are some GC-native ones as well like HeoCities (website
hosting) and Pulser (a Crosser social network).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers are simply called hackers. Their equipment is collectively known as a
Hacking Suite, and it can be anything from computers that wouldn’t look out of
place here in the real world to some fancy cybernetic implant. Target systems
tend to be private corporate intranets or other networks located on the station,
and whether hacking is done remotely or on-site depends on the specific mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most tests in Hard Wired Island use 2d6, with bonuses coming from one of the
PC’s main stats/approaches (Cool, Clever, Tough, and Quick), from a skill
specialty, from Augments (implants), and from Assets, which are special
equipment. There are rules for rolling with advantage/disadvantage (add a d6 and
drop the lowest/highest) or for Boosting rolls (add a d6, don’t drop
anything). Criticals happen when two or more dice roll the same value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system for hacking is a mixture of the systems for stealth and social
interaction. It has a set of specific actions associated with it, but also uses
some actions from those other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers begin each hacking attempt in a state called “Ghost”, meaning they
haven’t been detected by the target system’s security. They also begin with
three chances to avoid getting caught. Every time a hacker needs to do something
that requires a die roll, they might get caught if that test fails, and must
spend a chance in order to avoid that. If they fail a roll after running out of
chances, they’re discovered and their physical location is traced. Security is
on its way, but the hacker can still disconnect and try to run. A hacker can try
a Cover Your Tracks action to restore lost chances, but that’s also a roll so it
might backfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Target networks have two stats: a Network Level that determines the basic
difficulty of all tests made against it, and a Mood that describes the
strictness of its security procedures and how willing it is to let you do
things. Hacking is mostly about improving the network’s Mood towards
you. &lt;em&gt;Friendly&lt;/em&gt; networks are helpful, giving Advantage for data searches within
then. &lt;em&gt;Indifferent&lt;/em&gt; networks neither help nor hinder. &lt;em&gt;Hostile networks&lt;/em&gt; assume
everyone is an intruder until they can prove otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most networks start out Indifferent, and their mood can be improved to Friendly
through hacking actions, or degrade to Hostile by failures. Hostile networks
can’t have their mood improved except by gaining admin access. This can be done
by succeeding at a number of rolls equal to its Network Level, but it’s not
strictly necessary to accomplish your goals. Admin access on a network makes it
Friendly, and prevents its mood from lowering. Doing anything in there becomes
almost trivial and you only need to maintain Ghost if someone intelligent is
monitoring the network (like another admin or an AI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no deadly ice here, and no cybercombat at all. Getting discovered and
traced is usually enough of a threat here, since those armed goons will kill you
just as dead, and the heightened state of alertness from the target will also
complicate your teammates’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard Wired Island tries to abstract the extensive planning sessions players of
other games engage in with a resource named “Prep”. Before the mission itself
you use actions to gather both Individual and Group Prep, and you spend those
points during missions to use your Assets or acquire new ones on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do have a sample hacker here, the ever adorable Maru. Her Hacking Suite is
built into her cybereyes but she still operates it with a keyboard. She will be
going with the team on this one, which might mean leaving that keyboard behind
but won’t affect her effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will once again go with three separate target networks here. The office
network is level 5 and Friendly to access from the inside; the security network
used by the guards is Indifferent and level 6; and the isolated server is
Hostile and level 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the first two detect intrusion they grow Hostile, trace Maru’s location, and
notify both the guards and the police. If the secret server detects intrusion it
will destroy itself in a very messy and noisy fashion, drawing guard
attention. This counts as a mission failure for our purposes, since the team
will spend the rest of the run trying to leave the office without the evidence
they came here to collect. As these are separate networks they have separate
Ghost counters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in our series we’ll have to concern ourselves with stuff that
happens before the mission itself. Let’s make an Individual Prep roll for
Maru. She’s getting her software in order before the run, at her hacker den. We
roll 2d6 + Clever + Hacking + Hacker’s Den against a difficulty of 7, and get
a 11. Since this is the first Prep roll we’re making, Maru gains 1 automatic
Prep, and an extra 1 Prep for beating the difficulty by 4. She takes part in
Group Prep later, and let’s say they agree to leave 1 of those points for her
use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the actual run. As always, the rest of the team manages to bullshit the
receptionist and make into the office posing as a repair crew. Maru locks
herself into a stall in the ladies’ room and begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security network isn’t advertising itself, so I rule Maru needs a Search
roll to find it. Her bonus here is +3 from Clever and +2 from Hacking; the
difficulty is 11 (the network’s level + 5). She succeeds with 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there’s a lot she must do in this net, we spend 1 of her 3 Prep to
activate the Data Bomb program Asset, which gives her Advantage on her next
three rolls here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rule that opening the door and turning off the camera each require an Operate
roll. From what I see in the rules this seems to use the Drone specialty instead
of Hacking. Maru doesn’t have that, so she’s rolling only 2d6+3 from her
Clever. Thankfully, the Data Bomb still gives her Advantage on these rolls. She
succeeds at both rolls with a 12 and a 11, precisely because of that Advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maru and her team move to the records room, and find the secret server. She
jacks into it and begins searching for the data. The difficulties here are all
12 from the Network Level. Maru spends another Prep to activate the Ghost
Protocol program, giving her Advantage on her next Hacking roll and an extra
Ghost chance. These rolls &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use her Hacking specialty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantage once again lets her succeed with a 14. I think succeeding at this lets
her take the data? Let’s be cruel instead and ask for a Spoof roll to download
the data without authorization. This is a Hostile server after all. No more
advantage here, but she still gets a 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team leaves the records room and Maru connects to the security wifi to open
the exit door. She still has one roll with Advantage remaining from her use of
Data Bomb, and succeeds on the Spoof roll with a 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the way out secured, she searches the office network for the money. No roll
needed to locate it, it’s Friendly and advertising itself to people inside the
office premises. A Search with Advantage lets her find the money with a roll of
11 versus the network’s lower difficulty of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has no advantage for the Spoof roll to transfer the money elsewhere, but she
still succeeds with a 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mission accomplished! Time elapsed: around 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-analysis&quot;&gt;Run Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard Wired Island feels more complex than Neon City Overdrive in its
presentation, but the hacking sequence here was about as fast. This was in part
due to good rolls all through the run, but a failure here would have had less
impact than in my Neon City run. There, a failed roll would have meant
cybercombat, a system I didn’t get to try at all. Here it would have meant an
extra roll or two as I lost one of my Ghost points and retried the test. Perhaps
I’d have spent another action or two recovering those points as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping it to about one roll per Thing You Do seems to be key to keeping hacking
brief.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackathon: Neon City Overdrive</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/nco-cover.png&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Neon City Overdrive&apos;s cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neon City Overdrive is a game written by Nathan Russel and published by Peril
Planet Game Studio in 2020. This is the smallest core book of all the ones we’ve
seen so far at 72 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also be looking at a supplement named The Grid, which focuses on hacking
and has another 60 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of those 132 pages are dedicated to the setting and to a set of adventure
seeds, both of which are largely based on &lt;em&gt;vibes&lt;/em&gt; instead of relying on
laboriously crafted timelines or detailed maps. This is the game of stylish
cyberpunks running dangerous jobs in a neon-lit sprawl. The reader is expected
to take it from there to add details as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting as provided is just a basic sketch. The game takes place in The
City, which is divided into dense residential and commercial zones called
Metroplexes, equally dense hellish industrial blocks named Grinders, and the
Streets that flow in between. The City and the world it’s in are covered by the
Grid, a global computer network where nearly every device that can be described
as “electronic” or “computerized” has a presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Grid gets a somewhat more detailed description because I’m using material
from the supplement here. Like the physical world it has several components. The
Signal lets all those devices connect to the Grid. It’s maintained by an army of
antennas, and repeater drones. The devices attuned to the Signal generate The
Overlay, which is projected into the physical world as a combination of
holograms and augmented reality. Most devices have an augmented reality
interface instead of physical controls, and most signage exists in the Overlay
only. Hubs are big static computers. Some of them help route and maintain the
Signal and the Overlay, or host public virtual environments, but others are
private servers used by the sort of organization your cyberpunks need to hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the grid through an interface that resembles a real-world smartphone
or desktop browser, but it’s also possible to go into full immersion VR. This
works as you’d expect if you’re familiar with the genre (and if you’ve read the
other entries in this series, you are). We have our Gibsonian matrix here, with
wireframe or low-poly graphics by default, but with specific hubs represented as
more realistic environments. The more powerful the owner, the more realistic
their hubs’ presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of social events happen entirely in the Grid’s virtual reality, from
important business conferences to sport tournaments and nightclub
gatherings. Virtual reality ensures they feel mostly like physical events. That
sure would have been handy during our real world pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that “common” grid users are constantly monitored and
tracked. Player characters and other dirty criminals have their ways of evading
this, and despite the efforts of law enforcement agencies and corporate
security, grid crime is very common and not going away any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go into VR, you emerge at the Local Area Zone corresponding to your
physical location but can move to any other LAZ you can access with a
thought. Movement within a LAZ is restricted to the sort of thing a real person
would be able to do in the physical world, and the landscape reflects this. Want
to go to a site in your LAZ? You need to walk. The book recognizes this is
inconvenient. Some area zones are private, either disconnected from the public
Grid entirely or separated from it by virtual gates that admit only those with
the proper credentials. A skilled enough hacker might be able to break through a
gate. Totally isolated networks can only be accessed by physically jacking into
their hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can access the grid using wearable computers, which are cheap and widely
available. Serious hackers (called &lt;em&gt;codeslingers&lt;/em&gt; here) have an implanted
interface chip that has all the same functions and allows diving into VR as
well. Those who can’t or won’t use implants can make do with a “Grid-box”, a VR
helmet that also covers the mouth and nose. And both can further benefit from a
sensory deprivation chamber if they’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This default presentation is subject to change, as GMs are encouraged to tweak
the arrangement to get the right vibe they want. By tweaking the list of
available technologies and how common they are you could get anything from
mainframes-and-telephones with a chrome veneer to a Ghost in the Shell-like
ubiquitous net where everyone has implanted computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I understand the rules of Neon City Overdrive belong to the lineage of
Forged in the Dark games. There are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; specific mechanics for the Grid here,
not even if you use the supplement. Hacking uses the exact same mechanics as
everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests use six-sided dice. You start with one Action Die, and gain more for each
factor in your character sheet or the story that helps you succeed, and a Danger
Die for each factor that gets in the way. Then you roll the resulting pool. Each
Danger Die cancels an Action Die that rolled the same value. You take the
highest value rolled in the remaining Action Dice, and use it to determine the
result. A 3 or less is a failure, a 4 or 5 is a partial success with a cost
attached, and a 6 is a complete success. The book goes into a bit more detail
than this, but we don’t need it for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narration and the fiction it creates are &lt;em&gt;supremely&lt;/em&gt; important because they’ll
set the stakes for the roll and inform you of which positive and negative
factors are in play to build your die pool. Players are the only ones who roll
dice. Enemies and obstacles are a source of Danger Dice but the GM never needs
to roll for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking also uses those rules. The additional rules material in the Grid
supplement is just a clarification that purely physical traits and tags don’t
apply to tests made in the Grid, and Grid-specific ones don’t apply to the meat
world. Can´t use your muscle grafts to hack the Gibson, can’t use your fancy
programs to lift a car. Mental traits might apply to either “reality”, though.
The book encourages focusing on the imagery of the simulation and making it as
close to the physical world as possible, to make it easier for the group to
describe actions without needing to know a lot about computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re supposed to set the exact shape of our Grid when we play, so let’s say
it’s more or less the same as Shadowrun 4th Edition’s. It’s not a pure mesh
network, there’s cell tower hubs and such, but it’s close enough for our
purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hacker will be going along with the physical team. The target office’s Grid
layout is the same as in the SR4 version. The physical location surely has its
own set of tags but the one that affects us is that our good disguises give us
the &lt;em&gt;element of surprise&lt;/em&gt;. Losing this might be one of the consequences for a
hacking complication here. In a real game that’d affect the rest of the team
too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;target-systems&quot;&gt;Target Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an office intranet that’s connected to the general Grid through a
firewall, which we bypass by being inside the office. Its security from the
inside is &lt;em&gt;nothing special&lt;/em&gt; except that access to the bank accounts is
&lt;em&gt;well-guarded&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internal security wireless network covers the office but not connected to
the outside. It’s &lt;em&gt;hardened against intrusion&lt;/em&gt; and has a piece of Blue ICE
that will trigger at the first complication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our secret server in the records room with no wireless network at all. Our
hacker must physically jack into it. It’s also &lt;em&gt;hardened&lt;/em&gt;, and has Black ICE
constantly watching over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-hacker&quot;&gt;Our Hacker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pixie-non-binary-human&quot;&gt;Pixie (non-binary human)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trademarks and Edges&lt;/strong&gt;: Metroplexer, Codeslinger (Hacking, Cyber Combat),
Infiltrator (Alarms, Locks)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flaws&lt;/strong&gt;: Greedy, Socially Awkward&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gear&lt;/strong&gt;: Interface Chip (Fast, Advanced), Icebreaker (Silent, Deadly), Stealth
Program Suite (Mimetic, Subtle), something else non-hacking related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixie is kinda min-maxed to fit our scenario, to be honest, with lots of traits
that would apply to hacking. They’re a passable sneak in the physical world but
not very good at physical combat and bad at social interaction. That’s what the
rest of the team is for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team gets into the office as usual - we always assume this part works
out. Pixie hides in the bathroom to find the security network and hack into it
via VR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decide to roll the security server hack as an extended task, since those
require three successes and we have three goals in here. Pixie decides to use
Infiltrator instead of Codeslinger for this, since it is an infiltration of
sorts and that’s where they put put their Alarms and Locks edges. I’m being
lenient towards my player (who is also me) here. Those traits plus all other
relevant tags give Pixie a total of seven action dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixie is opposed by a single danger die, from the server being Hardened, but
that die rolls a six and eats the one I rolled on the action dice. They’re left
with a 5 and a 4, which count as successes towards our goal but apply
consequences as well. So I rule we lost our Element of Surprise and that the
Blue ICE on the server activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rule that the ICE hasn’t found Pixie yet, but it does get to add its relevant
tags as danger dice on the next roll as it looks for them. Fortunately none of
those roll a six and the action dice do, allowing Pixie to unlock the final door
ahead of time. Tests from this point on are made using Codeslinger as expected,
since they deal purely with stuff that lives in the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get to the secret server and I rule that the Black Ice in there is already
active but will only spot Pixie as a consequence - they start out stealthy. The
ICE however does get to add its Counter-Intrusion and Scary tags as danger dice
even so. Fortunately its rolls are crap and Pixie gets a 6, finding and
downloading the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s go for the money! This means the office network’s Well-Guarded
tag becomes a danger die, but as before the ice only comes online as a
consequence. We roll a 5 here, so it does come online, but not before we
transfer the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical team proceeds to try to leave the office, but as usual we stop our
simulation here since the main hacking bits are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total elapsed time: 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-analysis&quot;&gt;Run Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love engaging with crunchy mechanics but narrative systems do have their
advantages! 15 minutes is the fastest time we have so far, beating the “silent
run” from SR 4th Edition by 2 minutes. And this only took so long because I have
absolutely no experience with Neon City Overdrive and had to keep looking at the
books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible this run was too easy, but it’s okay because it’s inserted into
the larger context of the physical break-in. Pixie would have plenty to do in
that part of the run. I might have made a mistake here in simply having
“unaware” ICE add some of its tags to the hacking roll. The system is abstract
enough that I could have ruled slipping past the ICE undetected would require
“fighting” it and filling its Harm boxes while describing it as a sneaking
attempt. Whatever form it took in the narrative, combat would have made things
take longer, but not by much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanical bits of the run would probably be much faster than the 50/90
minutes I’ve been assuming here, but this would be offset in all cases by the
extended narration and roleplaying the game demands to frame those mechanics and
establish all the influencing factors for each roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our experiment however does allow us to conclude the obvious: when you use the
exact same simple resolution mechanic for everything, everyone has more or less
the same spotlight time and the classic “Decker problem” won’t manifest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Underwater Dungeon Fantasy 2: Items and Artifacts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I posted a compilation of methods and tools for &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html&quot;&gt;underwater
adventuring&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I’ll add a few items and artifacts that further
help with that or that make sense as possessions for underwater people. This is
a grab-bag article without much direction, but I hope it will be useful
nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alchemical-pills&quot;&gt;Alchemical Pills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any drinkable concoction (including magic potions) might be made as a solid pill
instead. Pills tend to be round, thumbnail sized, hard, and meant to be
swallowed whole. Pills are popular with alchemists and herbalists who don’t have
a line to a crystal vial supplier, and with underwater civilizations since
liquid potions don’t really work there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pill costs the same as the equivalent liquid potion. It’s waterproof and not
at risk of breaking from falls and the like, but it also can’t be put into
bandoliers for easy access during combat. Dry-swallowing a pill during a fight
requires either two Ready maneuvers or a single maneuver and a HT roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; put each of your pills into a separately-purchased crystal vial (DF1
p. 111) in order to have them in your potion belt, but that does add an extra
Ready maneuver to the process of ingesting it since you have to open the vial
first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elixir-of-water-breathing&quot;&gt;Elixir of Water Breathing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alchemical elixir can be found on GURPS Magic, and is “reprinted” here with
additional options. It’s a drinkable potion that lets you breathe underwater as
if you had Gills for 1d hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GM rolls the die in secret when you drink it, and you remain unaware of how
long you have… until 5 minutes before that time expires, when you get an
instinctive mental warning that you only have 5 minutes left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GMs who dislike the randomness can set a fixed duration based on how much they
want their PCs to spend on these potions. I suggest from 1 to 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purely aquatic people can instead get Elixirs of &lt;em&gt;Air&lt;/em&gt; Breathing for the same
price and with the equivalent effect for air. Both variants are very likely to
be found in pill form (see above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all cases, the potion is $600, 0.25kg (0.5 lbs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coral-items-4-cf&quot;&gt;Coral Items (+4 CF)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coral is a new implausible material: items made from it have a somewhat porous
texture but are covered in intricate natural patterns of bright colors. Coral
comes in rough or polished varieties, though both cost the same. Surfacers value
it because it’s pretty, underwater civilizations value it for its incidental
properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coral items can be made without fire, though they do require special magic and
techniques known to underwater armorers. They also have neutral buoyancy: their
weight does not count towards Encumbrance when determining the user’s penalty to
Swimming. Anything that’s usually made of metal or wood can be made of coral
instead. Being made of coral adds +4 CF to the item’s total cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;artifact-atlantean-armbands&quot;&gt;Artifact: Atlantean Armbands&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Origin: Divine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pair of gilded orichalcum armbands decorated with reliefs of sharks
and other marine creatures. The Atlantean Armbands were said to be a gift of the
gods to a human hero destined to become the queen of a great underwater
nation. That did indeed happen, and since all of the queen’s descendants were
born with the ability to live underwater the armbands became honored museum
pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ancient empire has long since fallen to the tides of history, so who knows
where these artifacts might surface next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Price&lt;/strong&gt;: $50.000.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight&lt;/strong&gt;: 0.5kg (1 lb) for the pair.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Item Capacity&lt;/strong&gt;: 20 FP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;properties&quot;&gt;Properties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When worn (one in each arm), they allow the wielder to freely breathe and move
underwater as if they had the Gills and Amphibious traits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If used as power items, any FP from the armbands that’s spent on the Swim and
Breathe Water spells is worth double the energy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variations&quot;&gt;Variations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some legends tell of another pair of armbands, of silver-plated orichalcum and
decorated with land-animal motifs, that would allow an aquatic wearer to breathe
air and walk on land, assuming a humanoid form if necessary. These were created
by an evil but powerful witch for a mermaid that wanted to walk among humans,
and are Druidic in origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of armbands, you could have rings, piercings, or amulets with the same
enchantments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackathon: Shadowrun 5th Edition, Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/sr5-cover.png&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Shadowrun 5th Edition&apos;s cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set our parameters in the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/11/09/hackaton-sr5-1.html&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, so let’s do the actual run in this
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our decker enters with her team, and they get past the reception as usual. This
time I decide to do things a little bit differently and go for spoofing
peripheral devices over trying to control them from inside the host. This seems
to be the correct way to do it in SR5, judging from the examples in the Matrix
chapter. The Control Device action is only used for things that would require a
conventional skill test if done in the physical world, like shooting a turret’s
gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the camera. It’s visible both in the real and in the Matrix, since
running silent would harm its functionality. Ms. Decker always prefers to use
the “quiet” Hack on the Fly action, since that’s her specialty. The camera and
other devices are tied to the office’s host, so they use the host’s ratings
instead of their own to resist. But when Ms. Decker places a mark on a device,
she automatically places a mark on the host as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She manages to place a mark on the camera, and therefore on the host. This means
she can dispense with silent running from this point on, since the Patrol IC
can’t tell the mark she has right now was illegally obtained and will no longer
try to raise an alarm. She uses a Spoof action on the camera, disabling it. Our
tally sits at 6. We do not want it to reach 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Decker knows there is an alarm, but it’s not immediately visible as an icon
on the Matrix. Unlike the camera, the alarm &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; running silent. A Matrix
Perception action reveals that there is indeed a hidden icon nearby. A couple
more attempts at it reveal the alarm’s icon. None of these perception tests
accrues Overwatch, since they’re not tied to the “illegal” attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She tries to mark the alarm, but fails! I spend 1 Edge to roll an additional 2
dice (her Edge score) on this, and get 2 extra hits. From what I understand, a
tie here isn’t a victory for either side, so ms. Decker still fails to mark the
alarm but the system does not detect her. Whew! The next attempt succeeds, but
both sides roll really well. The spoof attempt succeeds handily. Our tally sits
at 17 after all of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Decker disconnects from the host at this point since she needs to move with
the physical team. But since she does not reboot her deck, all of the marks she
placed remain on the host. Her Overwatch Tally also stays at 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team enters the records room and begins the physical search. Ms. Decker
spots a physical jackpoint here and uses that. She’s inside the host again, and
now she is able to see all of its remaining files and devices automatically
since none of them are silent. This includes the evidence she’s after, which is
only accessible from this jackpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downloading a file is automatic, but it requires a mark on it first. She manages
to mark and download the evidence, and then decides to go for the money. I rule
that this will require marking the account file and then editing it to transfer
the money. The marking goes smoothly, the editing runs into a tied test first,
succeeding on the second attempt. Fortunately only the marking accrued
Overwatch, which at this point sits at 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, still jacked into that physical access point, Ms. Decker attempts to
mark and spoof the exit door to unlock it. The marking succeeds, and the
spoofing gives me a bit of stress as again the first attempt ties and the second
one succeeds. Good rolls all around here, so our final Overwatch tally is a
dangerous 37.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hacker has time to safely jack out, and the team gets to walk away through
the now-unlocked door. All mission goals have been accomplished. She waits until
they’re out to reboot her deck, since that would erase all of her marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time: 31 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;31 minutes is something I consider fast, comparable to CP 2020 and CP RED. It’s
also about as easy to slice up into manageable chunks as CP RED’s and SR 4’s
runs were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this was a near-perfect run, with our decker remaining undetected
throughout the whole thing despite a couple of close calls. If we had been
detected at any point there would have been cybercombat and things would have
taken longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most of the other games we’ve looked at so far, it’s impossible to simply
kill all the ice, since each one a hacker destroys is just going to be
relaunched at the start of the next turn. The occasional assurances by the book
that you can rely on brute force alone to smash through a host ring a bit
hollow, since that seems like it leads to combat sooner even with good rolls
from the hacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had she activated the host’s ice, Ms. Decker would need to spend actions to hide
instead of just attacking. That Patrol IC would be trying to find her every turn
and she’d take a universal -2 dice penalty for silent running. I could see this
maybe doubling our run time, but I’m not going to count that as an official
timing. It’s just a guesstimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with this near-perfect run, we ended up with a tally of 37. With even
slightly better rolls from the host in a couple of places we’d have hit 40. This
wouldn’t have meant instant death since we’re inside a host, but it still would
have placed 3 marks on Ms. Decker at once, and let the host see her and start
activating IC. She sure hopes the team doesn’t get into a firefight on the way
out, because if she has to do anything else Matrix-related to help then she is
definitely going to draw the ire of Overwatch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackathon: Shadowrun 5th Edition, Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/sr5-cover.png&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Shadowrun 5th Edition&apos;s cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this post we’ll be taking a look at Shadowrun 5th Edition, originally
published in 2013. The book we’re looking at is the Master Index Edition
published in 2016, which is largely the same but incorporates some errata and
includes an index of supplementary material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll confess I have some reluctance to tackle this specific system, because its
return to expensive cyberdecks was part of what made me kinda stop paying
attention to Shadowrun at all. But I’ll read it with as open a mind as I can
manage and give its rules a fair shake just like I gave all the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I notice is that they have switched back to the more “conversational”
style employed by SR1, which makes it much harder for me to understand the
rules. It’s more of a problem here than it was in SR 1 because there are a lot
more rules and concepts they’re trying to get across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visually, the Shadowrun 5th Edition Matrix is a complete return to The Full
Gibson Experience. An infinite black plane criss-crossed by shimmering silver
lines, upon which swim thousands and thousands of icons representing small
connected devices and users. Way up above in the sky float the giant geometric
shapes of corporate hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descriptions focus almost entirely on the visual, with the technical bits
boiling down to “it’s everywhere” and “no one fully knows how it
works”. “Civilians” still use commlinks like they did in 4th edition, and
“smart” devices that are currently online around them show up as icons in
augmented reality. The descriptions we get for the uses of augmented reality
here are actually pretty good and evocative. However, it’s not the main
event. It seems that any time someone would use a web browser for something in
the real world, they go into full VR instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this Matrix has any basis in reality, it would be on the popular perception
people had of the Internet in 2013, and the fears they had for its future. Cloud
computing is a concept that looms large here despite not being explicitly
named. A Matrix host is a location that doesn’t have a 1-to-1 correspondence to
a single physical device. In other words, the reason they’re all up in the sky
and visible from anywhere in the world is because they’re all &lt;em&gt;in the
cloud&lt;/em&gt;. Access to cloud services also tends to be the explanation for why
certain devices gain mechanical bonuses when they’re online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Matrix is split into Grids. When you connect to the Matrix you are in
whatever local grid services your physical location. Big Corps have private
global grids where all their stuff lives. You can access stuff that’s in other
grids without going there, but for the best connectivity you’ll want to
grid-hop, which requires some hacking if you’re lacking credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “fears” part comes into play when the book says the Matrix is almost
entirely locked down and under the control of the megacorps. Those everyday
civilian uses are allowed, provided people pay their fees or consent to getting
bombarded with ads. The entire Matrix is watched over by the Grid Overwatch
Division, an organization composed of law enforcement and corporate specialists
whose job is to sniff out and eliminate any and all hacker activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hacker” here is an umbrella term that covers both &lt;em&gt;deckers&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;technomancers&lt;/em&gt;. Deckers use cyberdecks, devices which are a little bigger than
commlinks and have extra hardware that lets them be used for
hacking. Technomancers still use their quantum-bullshit-powered brains (and I
still think they’re cool).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberdecks are back to being super-expensive, with prices comparable to those of
SR1. The cheapest deck costs the same as an armored cargo truck, the starter
used by our sample character costs a bit more than a luxury sports car, and the
best one costs the same as a couple of light military vehicles. Fortunately it
appears they no longer require much in the way of optional hardware
enhancements, and programs tend to be much cheaper, but still the price of a
deck is once again the main thing making “decker” an exclusive specialist niche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devices have Matrix Attributes that dictate their base capabilities. All of them
have a Device Rating that represents their general robustness, a Firewall
attribute that is used for defensive rolls, and a Data Processing attribute that
gets used for searches and other generally lawful operations. Cyberdecks have
two others, Attack and Sleaze, which are used for hacking. Hosts have also have
these so that they can fight back against hackers. The full array is abbreviated
as “ASDF”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most devices, including hosts, have “static” attributes, but cyberdecks have an
“attribute array” of four numbers that can be allocated dynamically between
those last four values. Their device rating is still static and cannot be
changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of having user accounts, each icon, device or host has a single owner
that has full control over it, and it might accept &lt;em&gt;marks&lt;/em&gt; from other users on
to grant them more limited levels of access. An example is a social network host
lets users register by placing a mark. More marks means more access, and the
limit is three. The owner counts as having four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking a device means placing uninvited marks on it, and using the access those
grant to perform Matrix actions that get you closer to your goal. Different
actions require a different number of marks to attempt, and unless those marks
are legitimate most of them still require hacking tests to perform and might
fail. They’re opposed by the host’s rating and its ASDF attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking actions use either the Attack or Sleaze attributes. Attack actions are
“loud” and alert the host that it’s being attacked when successful; when they
fail, they cause Matrix damage to the hacker. Sleaze actions are “silent” and
don’t increase the hacker’s visibility when successful; when they fail, the host
becomes aware of the hacker, places a mark on them, usually triggers IC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With both types of action, successes on the target’s resistance rolls increase
the hacker’s Overwatch Tally, even when the hacker wins the contest. When this
tally hits 40, GOD’s eye is upon the hacker. They take a boatload of damage, get
forcibly ejected from the Matrix, and their physical location is instantly
traced. In other words, game over&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If inside a host when this happens,
they’re “merely” instantly detected and have 3 marks placed on them at once,
which makes all the host’s IC extra effective against them. And you bet all that
IC will be activated at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebooting your cyberdeck resets Overwatch Tally to 0, but it also erases all
marks you’ve placed, so while you’ll usually reboot right after a run is
finished you’ll need to wait a bit longer if you still need those marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IC fights using the host’s rating and ASDF attributes. Some variants try to
place additional marks on the hacker, while some attack either the hacker’s
deck, their brain, or both at the same time. The more marks IC has on the
hacker, the greater the damage they do. It’s possible for the hacker to spend
actions removing these marks, but this ironically is also an illegal action and
accrues Overwatch. It also doesn’t make the host or the IC forget about the
hacker, it just makes enemy attacks less effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matrix perception works a bit differently than in the past. Most icons in close
proximity (and there are several ways to define this) are automatically visible
and identifiable unless they’re &lt;em&gt;running silent&lt;/em&gt;, which means they require a
Matrix perception test to notice. Running silent gives a penalty to all of that
icon’s rolls, so the hacker is usually the only one running silent during a run,
and that only when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be using the sample decker from the core book, a dwarf lady. She has a
Hermes Chariot starter deck with a device rating of 2 and an ASDF of 5-4-4-2
(which is dynamic, as mentioned before). She has a few programs that help with
cybercombat but her specialty is still stealth, with an effective skill of 9 for
that approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like our host design philosophy is The Full Gibson once again. A given
location will have a single host that takes care of all of its business and is
connected to the wider Matrix, only this time it represents a set of servers in
the cloud instead of a mainframe. Nevertheless it is considered to be at the
same physical location as the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are rules incentives to being in close physical proximity to your target,
and our hacker lacks the accessory that would let us ignore those rules (a
Satellite Link), so she will be joining the physical team and hacking from the
inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a private business, so we’ll give the host a rating of 4 according to
the guidelines on page 247. Its ASDF ratings are 5-4-6-7, which gives us the
“surprisingly high security” requirement. Cameras, alarms, and door locks are
Rating 3. The alarm is running silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For IC, it runs Patrol at all times. When it detects an intruder it launches
Killer, followed by Track. When it detects unauthorized access to the buried
evidence it launches Sparky. As usual, whenever one of these is destroyed it’s
immediately relaunched at the start of the next combat turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file containing our target evidence would normally be &lt;em&gt;archived&lt;/em&gt; and thus
impossible to access without some social engineering, but we can cheat a bit
here and assume there’s a physical jack point in the records room that allows
access to the files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this in place, we’ll see how our decker does next post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Petty rant time: Many Shadowrun GMs love the idea of omniscient and
omnipotent organizations that stand ever ready to squash players, and I
guess GOD made it in either because of their demands or because some of
SR5’s writers were ascended GMs themselves. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

        alt=&quot;The cover of Cyberpunk RED&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     I still think this cover is cool.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/11/03/hackaton-cp-red.html&quot;&gt;both our netrunner and the systems she needs to hack&lt;/a&gt;, we can
start the actual run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G0blin Jr. goes in with the physical team, they get past the reception, and as
the rest of the team pretends to work she locks herself in the bathroom to try
and hack the security server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are cheating a bit here, because it turns out you need to be within six
meters &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; within line of sight of an access point to hack the corresponding
architecture. I don’t want to actually map the whole office out like I would in
a real adventure, so we’re kind of assuming the wireless networks here have the
same coverage as in the SR 4 version. They want to track where all guards and
guests are at all times so there are security server access points in each room,
covering the whole office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G0blin Junior’s strategy is to be meticulous and defeat each piece of ice as it
comes up, to avoid having them pile up on her. Still, even a meticulous approach
looks like a brutal all-out-assault here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-server&quot;&gt;Security Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior has no problem dealing with the Skunk ice at the top layer in the first
turn. She then uses the Pathfinder net ability to see deeper into the server and
rolls well enough to see the whole thing, even past the Password wall. She now
knows the exact route she must take - down the left branch to disable the alarm
and camera, and all the way down the right branch to unlock the back door and
plant a Virus to keep these things disabled after she logs out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick peek at the files on level 3 sees they’re worthless, and then it’s on to
the main event: the fight against the Hellhound/Killer pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She beats the Hellhound in the contested roll, but loses to the Killer and so
loses a program at random: the Eraser. It’s completely destroyed. We’ll be
generous and assume she has backed-up copies at home, but they can’t be restored
within this run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fearing for her software more than for her brain, Junior focuses her attacks
this first turn on the Killer, destroying it after 2 Sword attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we’re in for a slugging match with the Hellhound. It attacks once per
turn but always goes first, with Junior spending her 3 net actions per turn on
two Sword attacks and one Zap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good roll by the Hellhound in the following turn deals only 3 damage to Junior
(thanks to her Armor program), but also sets her on fire. She will begin taking
2 points of damage per turn until she spends a Meat Action to deal with
that. And she can’t afford to spend any Meat Actions now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of bad rolls on her part mean she misses her first turn of attacks, so
has to take more burn damage next turn. Fortunately the Hellhound fails to
damage her, and she can finish it off then. But she needs to wait for another
turn and 2 more burn points to be able to put out the fire: you cannot spend a
Meat Action in a turn where you spend Net Actions and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior is down a program and 20% of her HP so far. Fortunately she doesn’t have
any problem going down the Architecture’s left branch and disabling the alarm
and camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Skunk at the top of the right branch doesn’t give her any trouble. Turns out
Skunks are harmless when fought alone. The Asp in the next level beats the
initiative contest and destroys her Armor program, though it goes down to the
usual Sword, Sword, Zap combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior reaches the bottom of the security server, unlocks the door, and spends 2
Net Actions creating a Virus that will keep the security devices off after she
logs out. She then Cloaks her efforts and jacks out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time taken for the security server: 19 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secret-server&quot;&gt;Secret Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly singed G0blin Jr. follows her teammates to the records room and jacks
into the secret server she finds there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The password is a breeze to blow through, and a good Pathfinder roll lets her
see all the way to the bottom of the server. The Skunk is easily defeated by
turn 3 of this hack. The Wisp loses initiative and goes down before it can
act. The Hellhound wins initiative and further burns out poor netrunner’s brain,
leaving her with 17 remaining HP since she has no more Armor program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She manages to kill it with lucky Sword strikes before it can attack again, but
has to take 2 burn damage and spend a Meat Action extinguishing the fire. She
successfully IDs the evidence file and copies it. She knows there’s a Killer
further down but she’s hurt and down 2 programs, so she doesn’t risk engaging it
in order to cover her tracks. Junior jacks out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time for this hack: 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team has fulfilled their mission, but unlike the hackers of every other
game, G0blin Jr. decides discretion is the better part of valor. She’s
half-dead, down two very important programs, and that office net might have
another Hellhound like the two others she jacked into today (it doesn’t, but the
doesn’t know that). Plus there’s a chance that a firefight is ongoing in the
meat world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team leaves with the evidence, but without the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior deciding to give on the money and just leave is the sensible roleplaying
choice. All netrunners are brave folks by definition, but someone who names
herself after a goblin would probably not be &lt;em&gt;suicidally&lt;/em&gt; brave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-what-if-she-was&quot;&gt;But What If She Was?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if our Goblin had decided to brave the office network in her present state,
after all? What if she had thrown caution to the wind, messaged WITNESS ME to
her companions, and dove in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would have succeeded in 10 minutes, but just barely. The Asp takes out both
her Sword programs, and two max damage rolls from the Wisp leave her with a
measly 3 HP before she could derezz it and drain the office accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior is probably not making it out of the office if any sort of fight
erupts. And if she does a good chunk of that money is going to pay for her
hospital bills. Her teammates will probably begin calling her “Crispy” if she
survives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Time Elapsed&lt;/strong&gt;: 29 minutes if she doesn’t go for the money, 39 (and a
lot of pain) if she does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;analysis-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Analysis and Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;29 minutes is well within our tolerance for a manageable amount of time, so we
can say that CP RED’s system remains fast. It took around 12 minutes for Junior
to disable the camera and alarm, which is about what I consider the upper limit
on the time you can keep the rest of the team waiting. You could cut to the
physical team at that time and go turn by turn to keep everyone moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disabling the door has to happen in the same hack because the system resets when
the netrunner jacks out, but that’s an additional 7 minutes so it’s OK. The
secret server hack takes 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going for the “easy” office server after being beaten up by the first two does
indeed border on the suicidal. It’s fast at 10 minutes, but not worth
it. Cutting your losses and leaving is a perfectly rational decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because ye &lt;em&gt;gawds&lt;/em&gt; is this system brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stealth is not a thing in these rules. The closest thing is the Slide ability,
but that apparently only works to escape combat, not to avoid it. Most ICE
threatens to either permanently destroy your programs or directly damage your
HP, and if I understood the rules directly they get a free and automatic hit
against you if they beat that contested initiative roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So avoiding combat is impossible, and getting out unscathed is extremely
unlikely. I feared I made the CP 2020 data fortress too easy, and here I think I
made things too difficult by having three decent-sized Architectures generated
with the random system. It looks like CP RED wants a single big Architecture per
adventure instead of a bunch of scattered smaller ones. If there are smaller
ones, they should be &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; with at most a single piece of ICE or Demon, to help
preserve the netrunner for the main event.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/cp-red-cover.png&quot;
        alt=&quot;The cover of Cyberpunk RED&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     I still think this cover is cool.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we’ll take a look at Cyberpunk RED, the current edition of
Cyberpunk-the-game. It’s meant to be the followup to Cyberpunk 2020, and in a
nice bit of synchronicity it was published in 2020. It’s kind of a companion
piece to the Cyberpunk 2077 computer game, since according to the foreword the
two works started being made at around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CP RED provides what the critics of previously attempted 2020 sequels most
wanted: more of the same. It takes the 2020 setting forward to 2045 by
essentially doing a copy-and-paste on the timeline to extend it, so you have a
&lt;em&gt;new and improved&lt;/em&gt; ecological collapse, a &lt;em&gt;new and improved&lt;/em&gt; corp war that
leaves plenty of cybered-up veterans, and so on. Of course, it’s not an exact
copy and a lot of things are different, but the tone is almost exactly the same
as 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that underwent a big change was the Net, which we’ll look at
now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Net of Cyberpunk RED contains about the same amount of space magic as its
2020 ancestor, but it looks different. Somewhere around 2023 or so, iconic
netrunner Rache Bartmoss releases a bunch of data-destroying rabid AIs into the
old Net. They do so much damage that the authorities who oversee the old telecom
grid decide to shut it down entirely, in the process undoing the spell that made
the use of virtual reality possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays there’s still the notion that the Net is a parallel dimension, but it’s
a dangerous and fractured one. Each city has their own small Net realm, isolated
from the world by firewalls, and in between you have the wild and wooly domains
of rogue AIs and demon programs. Why do we need firewalls to keep them at bay if
there are no physical lines connecting them to us any more? Shut up, that’s
why. Any similarity between this and Shadowrun’s deep astral planes is probably
a coincidence, which is kind of a waste in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the city nets, someone came up with a new spell in 2035 that once again
let people see the virtual aspect of the Net in a simplified form. Now you can
put on a set of “Virtuality” goggles and see the parallel dimension of the Net
overlaid over the physical world, with every connected object having a
corresponding icon. The main difference here is that more things have icons, and
you can no longer leave your body behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard users mostly use the city nets through devices called Agents, which are
a bit like slightly smarter smartphones. They can use these for pretty much
everything we’d use the Internet for, except that they’re just accessing the
local city net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers are still called netrunners, and they still use cyberdecks. The servers
they hack are named Architectures, and can represent any device complex enough
to be the target of a netrun, not just mainframes. Due to the even stronger
“parallel dimension” metaphor here, you can only hack an Architecture if you’re
within about six meters of one of its physical access points. Netrunners can no
longer work from home. Devices not complex enough to warrant an Architecture
(including Agents) can be tampered with using electronics skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers are still named netrunners. To do their job they need the Interface
skill, interface plugs, “Virtuality” glasses and a cyberdeck. Cyberdecks in RED
look like their portable ancestors in 2020 and come in three generic tiers that
differ by the number of Option Slots they have (5, 6 or 7). Each Option Slot
lets you install a program or hardware expansion in your deck. Decks are not
uniquely expensive - their prices are in line with other types of specialist
gear in the book. Once you earn more money you can perhaps buy an armored
jumpsuit with a deck compartment that gives it an extra slot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most actions you can perform in a netrun can be done with the Interface skill
alone, including a basic attack. The roll is almost always 1d10 + Interface
against a difficulty set by the Architecture you’re hacking. Programs come in
three categories: “boosters” that can give bonuses to some of those basic rolls,
“attackers” that act as better weapons than your basic attack, and “defenders”
that reduce or negate damage while they’re active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netrunning happens faster than physical combat. Characters only get one “meat
action” per turn, but netrunners get a number of “Net actions” proportional to
their Interface skill. Some net tasks require meat actions, but you can’t use
net actions to do physical tasks. Programs that need to be actively used take a
net action to activate and can only be used once per turn, so there’s an
advantage to having multiple copies of the same attack program
loaded. Controlling a physical device takes a Net action, but each device can
only perform one action per turn as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Architectures are relatively abstract and modeled as tables. Each row in the
table is a level in the architecture, and it contains one thing. That thing
could be a file, a controllable device, or a security program. Netrunners start
at level 1 and can move down one level at a time. They don’t know what’s in a
level until they get there for the first time, and possibly pass some tests to
analyze the thing they find. If it’s a security program, it will prevent them
from descending further until dealt with. The stuff they want to steal or
sabotage tends to be in the middle or lower levels of an architecture, protected
by a few security layers. They can move through already-explored layers freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security programs range from password barriers to Black Ice, which is very
dangerous and can move through the architecture to chase a netrunner. It’s
pretty much a monster that you need to fight or die trying. Netrunners can also
run Black Ice from their decks, and order them to kill other netrunners or
programs in combat, but they take up 2 slots instead of 1. Black Ice tends to
attack right away - forget stealth for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another type of security program is the Demon, whose main purpose is to control
physical devices like turrets, drones, and traps to fight intruders. They’re
relatively weak at Net combat, but it’s hard to find and destroy a Demon that’s
shooting at your meat with a pair of heavy machine gun turrets…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think there’s a ready-made sample netrunner in the book, but the book
does include all we need to generate a quick-and-dirty one so let’s do that. I
think I do have some supplements that might have suitable ready-made
Architectures that fit our purposes, but if they do not then we can generate
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-netrunner-g0blin-jr-daughter-of-g0blin&quot;&gt;Our Netrunner: G0blin Jr., daughter of G0blin.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proudly carrying on the family tradition. Lazy but lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INT&lt;/strong&gt; 7  &lt;strong&gt;REF&lt;/strong&gt; 6  &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; 7  &lt;strong&gt;TECH&lt;/strong&gt; 7 &lt;strong&gt;COOL&lt;/strong&gt; 6
&lt;strong&gt;WILL&lt;/strong&gt; 3 &lt;strong&gt;LUCK&lt;/strong&gt; 6 &lt;strong&gt;MOVE&lt;/strong&gt; 5 &lt;strong&gt;BODY&lt;/strong&gt; 6 &lt;strong&gt;EMP&lt;/strong&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt;: 35
&lt;strong&gt;Death Save&lt;/strong&gt;: 6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyberware Capacity&lt;/strong&gt;: 14/60&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interface 4. Other stuff from the Netrunner Street Rat Pack as it becomes
relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyberware&quot;&gt;Cyberware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neural Link, Interface Plugs, Shift Tacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very Heavy Pistol with 30 rounds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whole-body Light Armorhack (SP 11)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cyberdeck (7 slots)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtuality Goggles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Programs: Armor, Sword x 2, Worm, Eraser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clothes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-target-systems&quot;&gt;Our Target Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for our target system, I could have made a single architecture for
everything, and the examples I have here kinda point in that direction, but I
really feel like this would benefit from the same approach as Shadowrun 4th
Edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ll have three Architectures here. One for the office network, one for the
security server, and one for the secret server. All individually small, but the
latter two with somewhat elevated security for their size. I’ll use the random
generator to help me with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Office network is Basic and has 7 levels, Security server is Standard and has 9
with a branch, the secret server is Standard and has 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;office-network&quot;&gt;Office Network:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password DV 6&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File (DV6) - Worthless&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password DV 6&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wisp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File (DV8) -&amp;gt; Accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-server&quot;&gt;Security Server&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password DV 8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File DV8 - logs, worthless&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hellhound, Killer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left Branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control DV8 - Camera&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control DV8 - Alarm Sensors, as Camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right Branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control DV8 - Door&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;secret-server&quot;&gt;Secret Server&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password DV8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wisp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hellhound&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File DV10 - The Evidence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Killer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll soon see how Junior manages these systems. I relied more on the random
generator here than on my own judgment, it might be that this ends up being too
hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My predictions are: since there is a lot of black ice in there, we’ll see plenty
of combat, but I also expect this to go fast. Either Junior kills everything and
completes the objective, or she dies fairly early while hacking the security
server. Probably while fighting the Killer/Hellhound duo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the worst happens, I’ll adjust the difficulty down a bit and try for a
successful run, timing how long that took.&lt;/p&gt;
