        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackathon: Neon City Overdrive</title>

   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Neon City Overdrive's cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neon City Overdrive is a game written by Nathan Russel and published by Peril
Planet Game Studio in 2020. This is the smallest core book of all the ones we’ve
seen so far at 72 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also be looking at a supplement named The Grid, which focuses on hacking
and has another 60 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of those 132 pages are dedicated to the setting and to a set of adventure
seeds, both of which are largely based on &lt;em&gt;vibes&lt;/em&gt; instead of relying on
laboriously crafted timelines or detailed maps. This is the game of stylish
cyberpunks running dangerous jobs in a neon-lit sprawl. The reader is expected
to take it from there to add details as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting as provided is just a basic sketch. The game takes place in The
City, which is divided into dense residential and commercial zones called
Metroplexes, equally dense hellish industrial blocks named Grinders, and the
Streets that flow in between. The City and the world it’s in are covered by the
Grid, a global computer network where nearly every device that can be described
as “electronic” or “computerized” has a presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Grid gets a somewhat more detailed description because I’m using material
from the supplement here. Like the physical world it has several components. The
Signal lets all those devices connect to the Grid. It’s maintained by an army of
antennas, and repeater drones. The devices attuned to the Signal generate The
Overlay, which is projected into the physical world as a combination of
holograms and augmented reality. Most devices have an augmented reality
interface instead of physical controls, and most signage exists in the Overlay
only. Hubs are big static computers. Some of them help route and maintain the
Signal and the Overlay, or host public virtual environments, but others are
private servers used by the sort of organization your cyberpunks need to hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the grid through an interface that resembles a real-world smartphone
or desktop browser, but it’s also possible to go into full immersion VR. This
works as you’d expect if you’re familiar with the genre (and if you’ve read the
other entries in this series, you are). We have our Gibsonian matrix here, with
wireframe or low-poly graphics by default, but with specific hubs represented as
more realistic environments. The more powerful the owner, the more realistic
their hubs’ presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of social events happen entirely in the Grid’s virtual reality, from
important business conferences to sport tournaments and nightclub
gatherings. Virtual reality ensures they feel mostly like physical events. That
sure would have been handy during our real world pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that “common” grid users are constantly monitored and
tracked. Player characters and other dirty criminals have their ways of evading
this, and despite the efforts of law enforcement agencies and corporate
security, grid crime is very common and not going away any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go into VR, you emerge at the Local Area Zone corresponding to your
physical location but can move to any other LAZ you can access with a
thought. Movement within a LAZ is restricted to the sort of thing a real person
would be able to do in the physical world, and the landscape reflects this. Want
to go to a site in your LAZ? You need to walk. The book recognizes this is
inconvenient. Some area zones are private, either disconnected from the public
Grid entirely or separated from it by virtual gates that admit only those with
the proper credentials. A skilled enough hacker might be able to break through a
gate. Totally isolated networks can only be accessed by physically jacking into
their hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can access the grid using wearable computers, which are cheap and widely
available. Serious hackers (called &lt;em&gt;codeslingers&lt;/em&gt; here) have an implanted
interface chip that has all the same functions and allows diving into VR as
well. Those who can’t or won’t use implants can make do with a “Grid-box”, a VR
helmet that also covers the mouth and nose. And both can further benefit from a
sensory deprivation chamber if they’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This default presentation is subject to change, as GMs are encouraged to tweak
the arrangement to get the right vibe they want. By tweaking the list of
available technologies and how common they are you could get anything from
mainframes-and-telephones with a chrome veneer to a Ghost in the Shell-like
ubiquitous net where everyone has implanted computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I understand the rules of Neon City Overdrive belong to the lineage of
Forged in the Dark games. There are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; specific mechanics for the Grid here,
not even if you use the supplement. Hacking uses the exact same mechanics as
everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests use six-sided dice. You start with one Action Die, and gain more for each
factor in your character sheet or the story that helps you succeed, and a Danger
Die for each factor that gets in the way. Then you roll the resulting pool. Each
Danger Die cancels an Action Die that rolled the same value. You take the
highest value rolled in the remaining Action Dice, and use it to determine the
result. A 3 or less is a failure, a 4 or 5 is a partial success with a cost
attached, and a 6 is a complete success. The book goes into a bit more detail
than this, but we don’t need it for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narration and the fiction it creates are &lt;em&gt;supremely&lt;/em&gt; important because they’ll
set the stakes for the roll and inform you of which positive and negative
factors are in play to build your die pool. Players are the only ones who roll
dice. Enemies and obstacles are a source of Danger Dice but the GM never needs
to roll for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking also uses those rules. The additional rules material in the Grid
supplement is just a clarification that purely physical traits and tags don’t
apply to tests made in the Grid, and Grid-specific ones don’t apply to the meat
world. Can´t use your muscle grafts to hack the Gibson, can’t use your fancy
programs to lift a car. Mental traits might apply to either “reality”, though.
The book encourages focusing on the imagery of the simulation and making it as
close to the physical world as possible, to make it easier for the group to
describe actions without needing to know a lot about computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re supposed to set the exact shape of our Grid when we play, so let’s say
it’s more or less the same as Shadowrun 4th Edition’s. It’s not a pure mesh
network, there’s cell tower hubs and such, but it’s close enough for our
purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hacker will be going along with the physical team. The target office’s Grid
layout is the same as in the SR4 version. The physical location surely has its
own set of tags but the one that affects us is that our good disguises give us
the &lt;em&gt;element of surprise&lt;/em&gt;. Losing this might be one of the consequences for a
hacking complication here. In a real game that’d affect the rest of the team
too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;target-systems&quot;&gt;Target Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an office intranet that’s connected to the general Grid through a
firewall, which we bypass by being inside the office. Its security from the
inside is &lt;em&gt;nothing special&lt;/em&gt; except that access to the bank accounts is
&lt;em&gt;well-guarded&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internal security wireless network covers the office but not connected to
the outside. It’s &lt;em&gt;hardened against intrusion&lt;/em&gt; and has a piece of Blue ICE
that will trigger at the first complication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our secret server in the records room with no wireless network at all. Our
hacker must physically jack into it. It’s also &lt;em&gt;hardened&lt;/em&gt;, and has Black ICE
constantly watching over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-hacker&quot;&gt;Our Hacker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pixie-non-binary-human&quot;&gt;Pixie (non-binary human)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trademarks and Edges&lt;/strong&gt;: Metroplexer, Codeslinger (Hacking, Cyber Combat),
Infiltrator (Alarms, Locks)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flaws&lt;/strong&gt;: Greedy, Socially Awkward&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gear&lt;/strong&gt;: Interface Chip (Fast, Advanced), Icebreaker (Silent, Deadly), Stealth
Program Suite (Mimetic, Subtle), something else non-hacking related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixie is kinda min-maxed to fit our scenario, to be honest, with lots of traits
that would apply to hacking. They’re a passable sneak in the physical world but
not very good at physical combat and bad at social interaction. That’s what the
rest of the team is for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team gets into the office as usual - we always assume this part works
out. Pixie hides in the bathroom to find the security network and hack into it
via VR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decide to roll the security server hack as an extended task, since those
require three successes and we have three goals in here. Pixie decides to use
Infiltrator instead of Codeslinger for this, since it is an infiltration of
sorts and that’s where they put put their Alarms and Locks edges. I’m being
lenient towards my player (who is also me) here. Those traits plus all other
relevant tags give Pixie a total of seven action dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixie is opposed by a single danger die, from the server being Hardened, but
that die rolls a six and eats the one I rolled on the action dice. They’re left
with a 5 and a 4, which count as successes towards our goal but apply
consequences as well. So I rule we lost our Element of Surprise and that the
Blue ICE on the server activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rule that the ICE hasn’t found Pixie yet, but it does get to add its relevant
tags as danger dice on the next roll as it looks for them. Fortunately none of
those roll a six and the action dice do, allowing Pixie to unlock the final door
ahead of time. Tests from this point on are made using Codeslinger as expected,
since they deal purely with stuff that lives in the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get to the secret server and I rule that the Black Ice in there is already
active but will only spot Pixie as a consequence - they start out stealthy. The
ICE however does get to add its Counter-Intrusion and Scary tags as danger dice
even so. Fortunately its rolls are crap and Pixie gets a 6, finding and
downloading the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s go for the money! This means the office network’s Well-Guarded
tag becomes a danger die, but as before the ice only comes online as a
consequence. We roll a 5 here, so it does come online, but not before we
transfer the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical team proceeds to try to leave the office, but as usual we stop our
simulation here since the main hacking bits are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total elapsed time: 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-analysis&quot;&gt;Run Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love engaging with crunchy mechanics but narrative systems do have their
advantages! 15 minutes is the fastest time we have so far, beating the “silent
run” from SR 4th Edition by 2 minutes. And this only took so long because I have
absolutely no experience with Neon City Overdrive and had to keep looking at the
books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible this run was too easy, but it’s okay because it’s inserted into
the larger context of the physical break-in. Pixie would have plenty to do in
that part of the run. I might have made a mistake here in simply having
“unaware” ICE add some of its tags to the hacking roll. The system is abstract
enough that I could have ruled slipping past the ICE undetected would require
“fighting” it and filling its Harm boxes while describing it as a sneaking
attempt. Whatever form it took in the narrative, combat would have made things
take longer, but not by much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanical bits of the run would probably be much faster than the 50/90
minutes I’ve been assuming here, but this would be offset in all cases by the
extended narration and roleplaying the game demands to frame those mechanics and
establish all the influencing factors for each roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our experiment however does allow us to conclude the obvious: when you use the
exact same simple resolution mechanic for everything, everyone has more or less
the same spotlight time and the classic “Decker problem” won’t manifest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Underwater Dungeon Fantasy 2: Items and Artifacts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I posted a compilation of methods and tools for &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html&quot;&gt;underwater
adventuring&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I’ll add a few items and artifacts that further
help with that or that make sense as possessions for underwater people. This is
a grab-bag article without much direction, but I hope it will be useful
nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alchemical-pills&quot;&gt;Alchemical Pills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any drinkable concoction (including magic potions) might be made as a solid pill
instead. Pills tend to be round, thumbnail sized, hard, and meant to be
swallowed whole. Pills are popular with alchemists and herbalists who don’t have
a line to a crystal vial supplier, and with underwater civilizations since
liquid potions don’t really work there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pill costs the same as the equivalent liquid potion. It’s waterproof and not
at risk of breaking from falls and the like, but it also can’t be put into
bandoliers for easy access during combat. Dry-swallowing a pill during a fight
requires either two Ready maneuvers or a single maneuver and a HT roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; put each of your pills into a separately-purchased crystal vial (DF1
p. 111) in order to have them in your potion belt, but that does add an extra
Ready maneuver to the process of ingesting it since you have to open the vial
first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elixir-of-water-breathing&quot;&gt;Elixir of Water Breathing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alchemical elixir can be found on GURPS Magic, and is “reprinted” here with
additional options. It’s a drinkable potion that lets you breathe underwater as
if you had Gills for 1d hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GM rolls the die in secret when you drink it, and you remain unaware of how
long you have… until 5 minutes before that time expires, when you get an
instinctive mental warning that you only have 5 minutes left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GMs who dislike the randomness can set a fixed duration based on how much they
want their PCs to spend on these potions. I suggest from 1 to 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purely aquatic people can instead get Elixirs of &lt;em&gt;Air&lt;/em&gt; Breathing for the same
price and with the equivalent effect for air. Both variants are very likely to
be found in pill form (see above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all cases, the potion is $600, 0.25kg (0.5 lbs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coral-items-4-cf&quot;&gt;Coral Items (+4 CF)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coral is a new implausible material: items made from it have a somewhat porous
texture but are covered in intricate natural patterns of bright colors. Coral
comes in rough or polished varieties, though both cost the same. Surfacers value
it because it’s pretty, underwater civilizations value it for its incidental
properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coral items can be made without fire, though they do require special magic and
techniques known to underwater armorers. They also have neutral buoyancy: their
weight does not count towards Encumbrance when determining the user’s penalty to
Swimming. Anything that’s usually made of metal or wood can be made of coral
instead. Being made of coral adds +4 CF to the item’s total cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;artifact-atlantean-armbands&quot;&gt;Artifact: Atlantean Armbands&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Origin: Divine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pair of gilded orichalcum armbands decorated with reliefs of sharks
and other marine creatures. The Atlantean Armbands were said to be a gift of the
gods to a human hero destined to become the queen of a great underwater
nation. That did indeed happen, and since all of the queen’s descendants were
born with the ability to live underwater the armbands became honored museum
pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ancient empire has long since fallen to the tides of history, so who knows
where these artifacts might surface next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Price&lt;/strong&gt;: $50.000.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight&lt;/strong&gt;: 0.5kg (1 lb) for the pair.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Item Capacity&lt;/strong&gt;: 20 FP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;properties&quot;&gt;Properties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When worn (one in each arm), they allow the wielder to freely breathe and move
underwater as if they had the Gills and Amphibious traits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If used as power items, any FP from the armbands that’s spent on the Swim and
Breathe Water spells is worth double the energy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variations&quot;&gt;Variations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some legends tell of another pair of armbands, of silver-plated orichalcum and
decorated with land-animal motifs, that would allow an aquatic wearer to breathe
air and walk on land, assuming a humanoid form if necessary. These were created
by an evil but powerful witch for a mermaid that wanted to walk among humans,
and are Druidic in origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of armbands, you could have rings, piercings, or amulets with the same
enchantments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackathon: Shadowrun 5th Edition, Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/sr5-cover.png&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Shadowrun 5th Edition's cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set our parameters in the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/11/09/hackaton-sr5-1.html&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, so let’s do the actual run in this
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our decker enters with her team, and they get past the reception as usual. This
time I decide to do things a little bit differently and go for spoofing
peripheral devices over trying to control them from inside the host. This seems
to be the correct way to do it in SR5, judging from the examples in the Matrix
chapter. The Control Device action is only used for things that would require a
conventional skill test if done in the physical world, like shooting a turret’s
gun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the camera. It’s visible both in the real and in the Matrix, since
running silent would harm its functionality. Ms. Decker always prefers to use
the “quiet” Hack on the Fly action, since that’s her specialty. The camera and
other devices are tied to the office’s host, so they use the host’s ratings
instead of their own to resist. But when Ms. Decker places a mark on a device,
she automatically places a mark on the host as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She manages to place a mark on the camera, and therefore on the host. This means
she can dispense with silent running from this point on, since the Patrol IC
can’t tell the mark she has right now was illegally obtained and will no longer
try to raise an alarm. She uses a Spoof action on the camera, disabling it. Our
tally sits at 6. We do not want it to reach 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Decker knows there is an alarm, but it’s not immediately visible as an icon
on the Matrix. Unlike the camera, the alarm &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; running silent. A Matrix
Perception action reveals that there is indeed a hidden icon nearby. A couple
more attempts at it reveal the alarm’s icon. None of these perception tests
accrues Overwatch, since they’re not tied to the “illegal” attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She tries to mark the alarm, but fails! I spend 1 Edge to roll an additional 2
dice (her Edge score) on this, and get 2 extra hits. From what I understand, a
tie here isn’t a victory for either side, so ms. Decker still fails to mark the
alarm but the system does not detect her. Whew! The next attempt succeeds, but
both sides roll really well. The spoof attempt succeeds handily. Our tally sits
at 17 after all of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Decker disconnects from the host at this point since she needs to move with
the physical team. But since she does not reboot her deck, all of the marks she
placed remain on the host. Her Overwatch Tally also stays at 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team enters the records room and begins the physical search. Ms. Decker
spots a physical jackpoint here and uses that. She’s inside the host again, and
now she is able to see all of its remaining files and devices automatically
since none of them are silent. This includes the evidence she’s after, which is
only accessible from this jackpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downloading a file is automatic, but it requires a mark on it first. She manages
to mark and download the evidence, and then decides to go for the money. I rule
that this will require marking the account file and then editing it to transfer
the money. The marking goes smoothly, the editing runs into a tied test first,
succeeding on the second attempt. Fortunately only the marking accrued
Overwatch, which at this point sits at 23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, still jacked into that physical access point, Ms. Decker attempts to
mark and spoof the exit door to unlock it. The marking succeeds, and the
spoofing gives me a bit of stress as again the first attempt ties and the second
one succeeds. Good rolls all around here, so our final Overwatch tally is a
dangerous 37.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hacker has time to safely jack out, and the team gets to walk away through
the now-unlocked door. All mission goals have been accomplished. She waits until
they’re out to reboot her deck, since that would erase all of her marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time: 31 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;analysis&quot;&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;31 minutes is something I consider fast, comparable to CP 2020 and CP RED. It’s
also about as easy to slice up into manageable chunks as CP RED’s and SR 4’s
runs were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this was a near-perfect run, with our decker remaining undetected
throughout the whole thing despite a couple of close calls. If we had been
detected at any point there would have been cybercombat and things would have
taken longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most of the other games we’ve looked at so far, it’s impossible to simply
kill all the ice, since each one a hacker destroys is just going to be
relaunched at the start of the next turn. The occasional assurances by the book
that you can rely on brute force alone to smash through a host ring a bit
hollow, since that seems like it leads to combat sooner even with good rolls
from the hacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had she activated the host’s ice, Ms. Decker would need to spend actions to hide
instead of just attacking. That Patrol IC would be trying to find her every turn
and she’d take a universal -2 dice penalty for silent running. I could see this
maybe doubling our run time, but I’m not going to count that as an official
timing. It’s just a guesstimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with this near-perfect run, we ended up with a tally of 37. With even
slightly better rolls from the host in a couple of places we’d have hit 40. This
wouldn’t have meant instant death since we’re inside a host, but it still would
have placed 3 marks on Ms. Decker at once, and let the host see her and start
activating IC. She sure hopes the team doesn’t get into a firefight on the way
out, because if she has to do anything else Matrix-related to help then she is
definitely going to draw the ire of Overwatch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackathon: Shadowrun 5th Edition, Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/sr5-cover.png&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Shadowrun 5th Edition's cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this post we’ll be taking a look at Shadowrun 5th Edition, originally
published in 2013. The book we’re looking at is the Master Index Edition
published in 2016, which is largely the same but incorporates some errata and
includes an index of supplementary material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll confess I have some reluctance to tackle this specific system, because its
return to expensive cyberdecks was part of what made me kinda stop paying
attention to Shadowrun at all. But I’ll read it with as open a mind as I can
manage and give its rules a fair shake just like I gave all the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I notice is that they have switched back to the more “conversational”
style employed by SR1, which makes it much harder for me to understand the
rules. It’s more of a problem here than it was in SR 1 because there are a lot
more rules and concepts they’re trying to get across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visually, the Shadowrun 5th Edition Matrix is a complete return to The Full
Gibson Experience. An infinite black plane criss-crossed by shimmering silver
lines, upon which swim thousands and thousands of icons representing small
connected devices and users. Way up above in the sky float the giant geometric
shapes of corporate hosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descriptions focus almost entirely on the visual, with the technical bits
boiling down to “it’s everywhere” and “no one fully knows how it
works”. “Civilians” still use commlinks like they did in 4th edition, and
“smart” devices that are currently online around them show up as icons in
augmented reality. The descriptions we get for the uses of augmented reality
here are actually pretty good and evocative. However, it’s not the main
event. It seems that any time someone would use a web browser for something in
the real world, they go into full VR instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this Matrix has any basis in reality, it would be on the popular perception
people had of the Internet in 2013, and the fears they had for its future. Cloud
computing is a concept that looms large here despite not being explicitly
named. A Matrix host is a location that doesn’t have a 1-to-1 correspondence to
a single physical device. In other words, the reason they’re all up in the sky
and visible from anywhere in the world is because they’re all &lt;em&gt;in the
cloud&lt;/em&gt;. Access to cloud services also tends to be the explanation for why
certain devices gain mechanical bonuses when they’re online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Matrix is split into Grids. When you connect to the Matrix you are in
whatever local grid services your physical location. Big Corps have private
global grids where all their stuff lives. You can access stuff that’s in other
grids without going there, but for the best connectivity you’ll want to
grid-hop, which requires some hacking if you’re lacking credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “fears” part comes into play when the book says the Matrix is almost
entirely locked down and under the control of the megacorps. Those everyday
civilian uses are allowed, provided people pay their fees or consent to getting
bombarded with ads. The entire Matrix is watched over by the Grid Overwatch
Division, an organization composed of law enforcement and corporate specialists
whose job is to sniff out and eliminate any and all hacker activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hacker” here is an umbrella term that covers both &lt;em&gt;deckers&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;technomancers&lt;/em&gt;. Deckers use cyberdecks, devices which are a little bigger than
commlinks and have extra hardware that lets them be used for
hacking. Technomancers still use their quantum-bullshit-powered brains (and I
still think they’re cool).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberdecks are back to being super-expensive, with prices comparable to those of
SR1. The cheapest deck costs the same as an armored cargo truck, the starter
used by our sample character costs a bit more than a luxury sports car, and the
best one costs the same as a couple of light military vehicles. Fortunately it
appears they no longer require much in the way of optional hardware
enhancements, and programs tend to be much cheaper, but still the price of a
deck is once again the main thing making “decker” an exclusive specialist niche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devices have Matrix Attributes that dictate their base capabilities. All of them
have a Device Rating that represents their general robustness, a Firewall
attribute that is used for defensive rolls, and a Data Processing attribute that
gets used for searches and other generally lawful operations. Cyberdecks have
two others, Attack and Sleaze, which are used for hacking. Hosts have also have
these so that they can fight back against hackers. The full array is abbreviated
as “ASDF”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most devices, including hosts, have “static” attributes, but cyberdecks have an
“attribute array” of four numbers that can be allocated dynamically between
those last four values. Their device rating is still static and cannot be
changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of having user accounts, each icon, device or host has a single owner
that has full control over it, and it might accept &lt;em&gt;marks&lt;/em&gt; from other users on
to grant them more limited levels of access. An example is a social network host
lets users register by placing a mark. More marks means more access, and the
limit is three. The owner counts as having four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking a device means placing uninvited marks on it, and using the access those
grant to perform Matrix actions that get you closer to your goal. Different
actions require a different number of marks to attempt, and unless those marks
are legitimate most of them still require hacking tests to perform and might
fail. They’re opposed by the host’s rating and its ASDF attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking actions use either the Attack or Sleaze attributes. Attack actions are
“loud” and alert the host that it’s being attacked when successful; when they
fail, they cause Matrix damage to the hacker. Sleaze actions are “silent” and
don’t increase the hacker’s visibility when successful; when they fail, the host
becomes aware of the hacker, places a mark on them, usually triggers IC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With both types of action, successes on the target’s resistance rolls increase
the hacker’s Overwatch Tally, even when the hacker wins the contest. When this
tally hits 40, GOD’s eye is upon the hacker. They take a boatload of damage, get
forcibly ejected from the Matrix, and their physical location is instantly
traced. In other words, game over&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If inside a host when this happens,
they’re “merely” instantly detected and have 3 marks placed on them at once,
which makes all the host’s IC extra effective against them. And you bet all that
IC will be activated at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebooting your cyberdeck resets Overwatch Tally to 0, but it also erases all
marks you’ve placed, so while you’ll usually reboot right after a run is
finished you’ll need to wait a bit longer if you still need those marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IC fights using the host’s rating and ASDF attributes. Some variants try to
place additional marks on the hacker, while some attack either the hacker’s
deck, their brain, or both at the same time. The more marks IC has on the
hacker, the greater the damage they do. It’s possible for the hacker to spend
actions removing these marks, but this ironically is also an illegal action and
accrues Overwatch. It also doesn’t make the host or the IC forget about the
hacker, it just makes enemy attacks less effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matrix perception works a bit differently than in the past. Most icons in close
proximity (and there are several ways to define this) are automatically visible
and identifiable unless they’re &lt;em&gt;running silent&lt;/em&gt;, which means they require a
Matrix perception test to notice. Running silent gives a penalty to all of that
icon’s rolls, so the hacker is usually the only one running silent during a run,
and that only when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be using the sample decker from the core book, a dwarf lady. She has a
Hermes Chariot starter deck with a device rating of 2 and an ASDF of 5-4-4-2
(which is dynamic, as mentioned before). She has a few programs that help with
cybercombat but her specialty is still stealth, with an effective skill of 9 for
that approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like our host design philosophy is The Full Gibson once again. A given
location will have a single host that takes care of all of its business and is
connected to the wider Matrix, only this time it represents a set of servers in
the cloud instead of a mainframe. Nevertheless it is considered to be at the
same physical location as the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are rules incentives to being in close physical proximity to your target,
and our hacker lacks the accessory that would let us ignore those rules (a
Satellite Link), so she will be joining the physical team and hacking from the
inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a private business, so we’ll give the host a rating of 4 according to
the guidelines on page 247. Its ASDF ratings are 5-4-6-7, which gives us the
“surprisingly high security” requirement. Cameras, alarms, and door locks are
Rating 3. The alarm is running silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For IC, it runs Patrol at all times. When it detects an intruder it launches
Killer, followed by Track. When it detects unauthorized access to the buried
evidence it launches Sparky. As usual, whenever one of these is destroyed it’s
immediately relaunched at the start of the next combat turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file containing our target evidence would normally be &lt;em&gt;archived&lt;/em&gt; and thus
impossible to access without some social engineering, but we can cheat a bit
here and assume there’s a physical jack point in the records room that allows
access to the files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all this in place, we’ll see how our decker does next post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;omnipotent organizations that stand ever ready to squash players, and I guess
GOD made it in either because of their demands or because some of SR5’s writers
were ascended GMs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Petty rant time: Many Shadowrun GMs love the idea of omniscient and &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackaton: Cyberpunk RED, Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/cp-red-cover.png&quot;
        alt=&quot;The cover of Cyberpunk RED&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     I still think this cover is cool.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/11/03/hackaton-cp-red.html&quot;&gt;both our netrunner and the systems she needs to hack&lt;/a&gt;, we can
start the actual run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G0blin Jr. goes in with the physical team, they get past the reception, and as
the rest of the team pretends to work she locks herself in the bathroom to try
and hack the security server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are cheating a bit here, because it turns out you need to be within six
meters &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; within line of sight of an access point to hack the corresponding
architecture. I don’t want to actually map the whole office out like I would in
a real adventure, so we’re kind of assuming the wireless networks here have the
same coverage as in the SR 4 version. They want to track where all guards and
guests are at all times so there are security server access points in each room,
covering the whole office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G0blin Junior’s strategy is to be meticulous and defeat each piece of ice as it
comes up, to avoid having them pile up on her. Still, even a meticulous approach
looks like a brutal all-out-assault here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-server&quot;&gt;Security Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior has no problem dealing with the Skunk ice at the top layer in the first
turn. She then uses the Pathfinder net ability to see deeper into the server and
rolls well enough to see the whole thing, even past the Password wall. She now
knows the exact route she must take - down the left branch to disable the alarm
and camera, and all the way down the right branch to unlock the back door and
plant a Virus to keep these things disabled after she logs out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick peek at the files on level 3 sees they’re worthless, and then it’s on to
the main event: the fight against the Hellhound/Killer pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She beats the Hellhound in the contested roll, but loses to the Killer and so
loses a program at random: the Eraser. It’s completely destroyed. We’ll be
generous and assume she has backed-up copies at home, but they can’t be restored
within this run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fearing for her software more than for her brain, Junior focuses her attacks
this first turn on the Killer, destroying it after 2 Sword attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we’re in for a slugging match with the Hellhound. It attacks once per
turn but always goes first, with Junior spending her 3 net actions per turn on
two Sword attacks and one Zap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good roll by the Hellhound in the following turn deals only 3 damage to Junior
(thanks to her Armor program), but also sets her on fire. She will begin taking
2 points of damage per turn until she spends a Meat Action to deal with
that. And she can’t afford to spend any Meat Actions now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of bad rolls on her part mean she misses her first turn of attacks, so
has to take more burn damage next turn. Fortunately the Hellhound fails to
damage her, and she can finish it off then. But she needs to wait for another
turn and 2 more burn points to be able to put out the fire: you cannot spend a
Meat Action in a turn where you spend Net Actions and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior is down a program and 20% of her HP so far. Fortunately she doesn’t have
any problem going down the Architecture’s left branch and disabling the alarm
and camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Skunk at the top of the right branch doesn’t give her any trouble. Turns out
Skunks are harmless when fought alone. The Asp in the next level beats the
initiative contest and destroys her Armor program, though it goes down to the
usual Sword, Sword, Zap combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior reaches the bottom of the security server, unlocks the door, and spends 2
Net Actions creating a Virus that will keep the security devices off after she
logs out. She then Cloaks her efforts and jacks out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time taken for the security server: 19 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secret-server&quot;&gt;Secret Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly singed G0blin Jr. follows her teammates to the records room and jacks
into the secret server she finds there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The password is a breeze to blow through, and a good Pathfinder roll lets her
see all the way to the bottom of the server. The Skunk is easily defeated by
turn 3 of this hack. The Wisp loses initiative and goes down before it can
act. The Hellhound wins initiative and further burns out poor netrunner’s brain,
leaving her with 17 remaining HP since she has no more Armor program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She manages to kill it with lucky Sword strikes before it can attack again, but
has to take 2 burn damage and spend a Meat Action extinguishing the fire. She
successfully IDs the evidence file and copies it. She knows there’s a Killer
further down but she’s hurt and down 2 programs, so she doesn’t risk engaging it
in order to cover her tracks. Junior jacks out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time for this hack: 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team has fulfilled their mission, but unlike the hackers of every other
game, G0blin Jr. decides discretion is the better part of valor. She’s
half-dead, down two very important programs, and that office net might have
another Hellhound like the two others she jacked into today (it doesn’t, but the
doesn’t know that). Plus there’s a chance that a firefight is ongoing in the
meat world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team leaves with the evidence, but without the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior deciding to give on the money and just leave is the sensible roleplaying
choice. All netrunners are brave folks by definition, but someone who names
herself after a goblin would probably not be &lt;em&gt;suicidally&lt;/em&gt; brave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-what-if-she-was&quot;&gt;But What If She Was?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if our Goblin had decided to brave the office network in her present state,
after all? What if she had thrown caution to the wind, messaged WITNESS ME to
her companions, and dove in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would have succeeded in 10 minutes, but just barely. The Asp takes out both
her Sword programs, and two max damage rolls from the Wisp leave her with a
measly 3 HP before she could derezz it and drain the office accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior is probably not making it out of the office if any sort of fight
erupts. And if she does a good chunk of that money is going to pay for her
hospital bills. Her teammates will probably begin calling her “Crispy” if she
survives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Time Elapsed&lt;/strong&gt;: 29 minutes if she doesn’t go for the money, 39 (and a
lot of pain) if she does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;analysis-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Analysis and Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;29 minutes is well within our tolerance for a manageable amount of time, so we
can say that CP RED’s system remains fast. It took around 12 minutes for Junior
to disable the camera and alarm, which is about what I consider the upper limit
on the time you can keep the rest of the team waiting. You could cut to the
physical team at that time and go turn by turn to keep everyone moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disabling the door has to happen in the same hack because the system resets when
the netrunner jacks out, but that’s an additional 7 minutes so it’s OK. The
secret server hack takes 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going for the “easy” office server after being beaten up by the first two does
indeed border on the suicidal. It’s fast at 10 minutes, but not worth
it. Cutting your losses and leaving is a perfectly rational decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because ye &lt;em&gt;gawds&lt;/em&gt; is this system brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stealth is not a thing in these rules. The closest thing is the Slide ability,
but that apparently only works to escape combat, not to avoid it. Most ICE
threatens to either permanently destroy your programs or directly damage your
HP, and if I understood the rules directly they get a free and automatic hit
against you if they beat that contested initiative roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So avoiding combat is impossible, and getting out unscathed is extremely
unlikely. I feared I made the CP 2020 data fortress too easy, and here I think I
made things too difficult by having three decent-sized Architectures generated
with the random system. It looks like CP RED wants a single big Architecture per
adventure instead of a bunch of scattered smaller ones. If there are smaller
ones, they should be &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; with at most a single piece of ICE or Demon, to help
preserve the netrunner for the main event.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/cp-red-cover.png&quot;
        alt=&quot;The cover of Cyberpunk RED&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     I still think this cover is cool.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we’ll take a look at Cyberpunk RED, the current edition of
Cyberpunk-the-game. It’s meant to be the followup to Cyberpunk 2020, and in a
nice bit of synchronicity it was published in 2020. It’s kind of a companion
piece to the Cyberpunk 2077 computer game, since according to the foreword the
two works started being made at around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CP RED provides what the critics of previously attempted 2020 sequels most
wanted: more of the same. It takes the 2020 setting forward to 2045 by
essentially doing a copy-and-paste on the timeline to extend it, so you have a
&lt;em&gt;new and improved&lt;/em&gt; ecological collapse, a &lt;em&gt;new and improved&lt;/em&gt; corp war that
leaves plenty of cybered-up veterans, and so on. Of course, it’s not an exact
copy and a lot of things are different, but the tone is almost exactly the same
as 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that underwent a big change was the Net, which we’ll look at
now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Net of Cyberpunk RED contains about the same amount of space magic as its
2020 ancestor, but it looks different. Somewhere around 2023 or so, iconic
netrunner Rache Bartmoss releases a bunch of data-destroying rabid AIs into the
old Net. They do so much damage that the authorities who oversee the old telecom
grid decide to shut it down entirely, in the process undoing the spell that made
the use of virtual reality possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays there’s still the notion that the Net is a parallel dimension, but it’s
a dangerous and fractured one. Each city has their own small Net realm, isolated
from the world by firewalls, and in between you have the wild and wooly domains
of rogue AIs and demon programs. Why do we need firewalls to keep them at bay if
there are no physical lines connecting them to us any more? Shut up, that’s
why. Any similarity between this and Shadowrun’s deep astral planes is probably
a coincidence, which is kind of a waste in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the city nets, someone came up with a new spell in 2035 that once again
let people see the virtual aspect of the Net in a simplified form. Now you can
put on a set of “Virtuality” goggles and see the parallel dimension of the Net
overlaid over the physical world, with every connected object having a
corresponding icon. The main difference here is that more things have icons, and
you can no longer leave your body behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard users mostly use the city nets through devices called Agents, which are
a bit like slightly smarter smartphones. They can use these for pretty much
everything we’d use the Internet for, except that they’re just accessing the
local city net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers are still called netrunners, and they still use cyberdecks. The servers
they hack are named Architectures, and can represent any device complex enough
to be the target of a netrun, not just mainframes. Due to the even stronger
“parallel dimension” metaphor here, you can only hack an Architecture if you’re
within about six meters of one of its physical access points. Netrunners can no
longer work from home. Devices not complex enough to warrant an Architecture
(including Agents) can be tampered with using electronics skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers are still named netrunners. To do their job they need the Interface
skill, interface plugs, “Virtuality” glasses and a cyberdeck. Cyberdecks in RED
look like their portable ancestors in 2020 and come in three generic tiers that
differ by the number of Option Slots they have (5, 6 or 7). Each Option Slot
lets you install a program or hardware expansion in your deck. Decks are not
uniquely expensive - their prices are in line with other types of specialist
gear in the book. Once you earn more money you can perhaps buy an armored
jumpsuit with a deck compartment that gives it an extra slot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most actions you can perform in a netrun can be done with the Interface skill
alone, including a basic attack. The roll is almost always 1d10 + Interface
against a difficulty set by the Architecture you’re hacking. Programs come in
three categories: “boosters” that can give bonuses to some of those basic rolls,
“attackers” that act as better weapons than your basic attack, and “defenders”
that reduce or negate damage while they’re active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netrunning happens faster than physical combat. Characters only get one “meat
action” per turn, but netrunners get a number of “Net actions” proportional to
their Interface skill. Some net tasks require meat actions, but you can’t use
net actions to do physical tasks. Programs that need to be actively used take a
net action to activate and can only be used once per turn, so there’s an
advantage to having multiple copies of the same attack program
loaded. Controlling a physical device takes a Net action, but each device can
only perform one action per turn as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Architectures are relatively abstract and modeled as tables. Each row in the
table is a level in the architecture, and it contains one thing. That thing
could be a file, a controllable device, or a security program. Netrunners start
at level 1 and can move down one level at a time. They don’t know what’s in a
level until they get there for the first time, and possibly pass some tests to
analyze the thing they find. If it’s a security program, it will prevent them
from descending further until dealt with. The stuff they want to steal or
sabotage tends to be in the middle or lower levels of an architecture, protected
by a few security layers. They can move through already-explored layers freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security programs range from password barriers to Black Ice, which is very
dangerous and can move through the architecture to chase a netrunner. It’s
pretty much a monster that you need to fight or die trying. Netrunners can also
run Black Ice from their decks, and order them to kill other netrunners or
programs in combat, but they take up 2 slots instead of 1. Black Ice tends to
attack right away - forget stealth for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another type of security program is the Demon, whose main purpose is to control
physical devices like turrets, drones, and traps to fight intruders. They’re
relatively weak at Net combat, but it’s hard to find and destroy a Demon that’s
shooting at your meat with a pair of heavy machine gun turrets…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think there’s a ready-made sample netrunner in the book, but the book
does include all we need to generate a quick-and-dirty one so let’s do that. I
think I do have some supplements that might have suitable ready-made
Architectures that fit our purposes, but if they do not then we can generate
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-netrunner-g0blin-jr-daughter-of-g0blin&quot;&gt;Our Netrunner: G0blin Jr., daughter of G0blin.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proudly carrying on the family tradition. Lazy but lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INT&lt;/strong&gt; 7  &lt;strong&gt;REF&lt;/strong&gt; 6  &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; 7  &lt;strong&gt;TECH&lt;/strong&gt; 7 &lt;strong&gt;COOL&lt;/strong&gt; 6
&lt;strong&gt;WILL&lt;/strong&gt; 3 &lt;strong&gt;LUCK&lt;/strong&gt; 6 &lt;strong&gt;MOVE&lt;/strong&gt; 5 &lt;strong&gt;BODY&lt;/strong&gt; 6 &lt;strong&gt;EMP&lt;/strong&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt;: 35
&lt;strong&gt;Death Save&lt;/strong&gt;: 6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyberware Capacity&lt;/strong&gt;: 14/60&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interface 4. Other stuff from the Netrunner Street Rat Pack as it becomes
relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyberware&quot;&gt;Cyberware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neural Link, Interface Plugs, Shift Tacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very Heavy Pistol with 30 rounds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whole-body Light Armorhack (SP 11)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cyberdeck (7 slots)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtuality Goggles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Programs: Armor, Sword x 2, Worm, Eraser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clothes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-target-systems&quot;&gt;Our Target Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for our target system, I could have made a single architecture for
everything, and the examples I have here kinda point in that direction, but I
really feel like this would benefit from the same approach as Shadowrun 4th
Edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ll have three Architectures here. One for the office network, one for the
security server, and one for the secret server. All individually small, but the
latter two with somewhat elevated security for their size. I’ll use the random
generator to help me with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Office network is Basic and has 7 levels, Security server is Standard and has 9
with a branch, the secret server is Standard and has 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;office-network&quot;&gt;Office Network:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password DV 6&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File (DV6) - Worthless&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password DV 6&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wisp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File (DV8) -&amp;gt; Accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-server&quot;&gt;Security Server&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password DV 8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File DV8 - logs, worthless&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hellhound, Killer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left Branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control DV8 - Camera&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control DV8 - Alarm Sensors, as Camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right Branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control DV8 - Door&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;secret-server&quot;&gt;Secret Server&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password DV8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wisp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hellhound&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File DV10 - The Evidence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Killer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll soon see how Junior manages these systems. I relied more on the random
generator here than on my own judgment, it might be that this ends up being too
hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My predictions are: since there is a lot of black ice in there, we’ll see plenty
of combat, but I also expect this to go fast. Either Junior kills everything and
completes the objective, or she dies fairly early while hacking the security
server. Probably while fighting the Killer/Hellhound duo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the worst happens, I’ll adjust the difficulty down a bit and try for a
successful run, timing how long that took.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackaton: Shadowrun 4th Edition, Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/sr4-cover.jpg&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Shadowrun 20th Anniversary's cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After setting up our parameters in the previous post, we start the run here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually ran this one a couple of times, because it took me a bit to fully
internalize the rules. My main mistake was assuming I was familiar with them
already and only reading them superficially to “refresh my memory”. This made me
get some crucial basic facts wrong, causing my first run to be really fast but
incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I made an additional run where I tracked the die rolls accurately and got
detected in one of the hacks. Then I read the rules outside of the Matrix
chapter more closely and made another one where I spent Edge more wisely and
accomplished all goals without being detected. I’m referring to these as the
&lt;strong&gt;loud&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;silent&lt;/strong&gt; runs. They are recorded below as a single account with
notes on how they diverge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;diff-merging-timelines&quot;&gt;Diff-merging Timelines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hacker enters the building with is team. They get past the reception as
usual, receiving temporary badges. Once inside, he feels a “sudden” need to go
to the bathroom, and locks himself inside a stall. He spends a couple of turns
scanning for the badge’s wireless signal, and finds it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then tries to hack into the badge, still using AR because it’s a fragging’
badge. He succeeds quickly. As expected the badge can’t do a lot, but it knows
how to talk to the security server and now so does the hacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hacker then switches to VR and goes hot, after bracing himself so he doesn’t
fall down in the stall. He tries to get himself security-level access because he
knows from examining the badge that user-level accounts do nothing in this
server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where our timelines diverge. In the &lt;strong&gt;loud&lt;/strong&gt; run, he gets in but also
gets detected. The server issues a restricted alert against his persona,
triggers the Blackout ice, and pings the guards. Restricted alert means the
server’s Firewall increases by +4 against the hacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hacker and the IC go into cybercombat, with the hacker winning
initiative. Cybercombat here resembles the SR1 version a bit, though the exact
things you roll are different. With the expenditure of a couple points of Edge,
our hacker manages to destroy the ice at the start of the second combat turn,
without suffering any trauma to his brain meats. Still, in this timeline the
guards are suspicious of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;silent&lt;/strong&gt; run, luckier rolls let the hacker in without being detected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both, the hacker manages to disable the camera and alarm, letting the team
move into the records room. While they perform a physical search for hard
copies, our hacker jacks into the secret isolated server and goes into hot sim
VR again. He manages to get in undetected, though in the &lt;strong&gt;silent&lt;/strong&gt; run he has
to spend the Edge he didn’t spend in combat to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rule that finding the files requires no tests, as this is only a single node
and the existing data search rules are for searching the Matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still in the records room, our hacker decides to be daring and hack the office
network in search of those drainable accounts. This network has a wireless
signal covering the whole office and is quite visible, so he gets right to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, our decker easily hacks himself a user account. From there he runs a
data search on the network’s user directory to find the one who has access to
the bank accounts, and then attempts to gain access to it. I give this a low
Threshold because it’s a small intranet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the accountant’s profile, the hacker attempts to hack into it. That’s
like starting from scratch, this time going for a security account. Again the
hacker manages to get in undetected, and again in the &lt;strong&gt;silent&lt;/strong&gt; run he needs to
spend Edge to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draining the account requires no additional rolls. And since our hacker retained
his account at the security server, unlocking the back door requires no rolls
either. Of course, in the &lt;strong&gt;loud&lt;/strong&gt; timeline there’s a very high chance that
they’re doing this during a firefight, as the guards are extra-suspicious and
would have known to check the records room…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;loud&lt;/strong&gt; run that had cybercombat and an alert took 31 minutes. The
&lt;strong&gt;silent&lt;/strong&gt; one took 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-analysis-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Run Analysis and Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system is my personal favorite so far, and I had to actively keep myself
from adding little cool bits that kept appearing in my imagination, because I’d
otherwise would have found myself running an entire solo adventure, controlling
the whole team and imagining dialogue in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having “my” character be present with the group certainly helped stir the
imagination, because he wasn’t sitting pretty at home. I had to think about how
he navigated the physical site with the rest of the group, and from where he’d
jack into VR to avoid suspicion, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do love that the system was very fast compared to the other ones so far, but I
wonder how much of that is down to the design of the target nodes. I’d love to
hear about how people design their own adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see how Shadowrun’s system still favors silent runs here. Cybercombat
against even a single instance of ICE takes a while to resolve, and the more of
it there is the longer the run will take. Careless hackers could easily find
themselves having to deal with multiple ICE cubes at once, perhaps even in
different hosts, and that will drastically lower their chances of success. More
advanced rules let hackers run their own agent programs, which helps fighting
the icy hordes but makes things take more real time to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, let’s see how our sample runs here fit with the physical team’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we again assume the physical part of the run takes 50 minutes for a perfectly
stealthy team and 90 minutes with a firefight on the way out, then it’s also
possible to correlate our diverging runs to each of these scenarios. The
perfectly sneaky run would mean a perfectly sneaky hack. The loud run would
almost certainly be caused by that alert we got, unless our talker was &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;
at their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the more common silent/silent and loud/loud scenarios, our hacker took up
around 25% of the total session time, which is pretty close to ideal in a
four-player party. In an anomalous loud hack/silent run scenario, they take up a
little under half the run time. And in a silent hack/loud run situation, they
take around 15% of the time hacking the objectives and can spend the rest of
their spotlight time helping out in physical combat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackathon: Shadowrun 4th Edition</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/sr4-cover.jpg&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Shadowrun 20th Anniversary's cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this post we’ll be using Shadowrun 4th Edition, published in 2005. More
specifically, we’ll be using the 20th Anniversary core book published in 2009,
which uses the same base rules as 4th Edition but incorporates errata and some
material that was previously published in supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Shadowrun 1e’s Matrix was inspired by 80s mainframes, then 4th edition’s is
inspired by the Internet as it was in 2005, plus some reasonable extrapolations
of things that were in fashion among futurists then but didn’t necessarily pan
out in the following decades. It does end up looking a lot like what we actually
have here in 2023, with a few important differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of being built around high-speed cell towers, the mobile Matrix is a
ubiquitous wireless mesh network. Individual devices in a mesh cooperate to
route its network traffic without the need for central coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Things was also in fashion, so every object that could possibly
have a use for built-in computing and network capability has that
capability. Most of those devices are fairly limited, but computer hardware is
apparently so cheap and standardized that many of them have unused capacity that
could be repurposed by a clever hacker. One example is someone converting cheap
appliances into mesh routers to to bring connectivity to a “dead zone”. It’s
also easy to turn off a device’s wireless capability with a simple command or in
some cases a physical switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone carries a &lt;em&gt;commlink&lt;/em&gt;, a device that’s equivalent to a real-world
smartphone in form factor and usage. They often connect to a variety of
&lt;em&gt;peripherals&lt;/em&gt;, more limited devices that are built to talk to commlinks and not
to the wider Matrix. These range from augmented-reality glasses to that
smartlinked gun your character owns. A big server of the sort that’s the target
of a hacking run is called a &lt;em&gt;nexus&lt;/em&gt;. I will just say “server” instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augmented Reality is a big deal here, with most things connected to a mesh
having some sort of AR presence, and general interaction with your commlink and
the Matrix happening through AR interfaces. If you can use AR to help with your
current task you gain a bonus to the roll. Examples include finding your way
around town with that handy videogame-style minimap, overlaying a blueprint and
instructions over the thing you’re fixing, firing a smarlinked gun, finding
someone in a crowd when you have a face-recognition database, and so on. One can
also choose to go “full VR”, which more useful for certain applications (mainly
hacking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secure facilities of the sort shadowrunners are hired to break into have
internal mesh networks. They use tactics like limited signal ranges and
radio-blocking paint to keep their signal contained to the physical space they
service, and might not be connected to the wider Matrix at all. In some the
paydata is going to be in a server that’s only accessible via wired connection
or even via its own terminal. While sometimes it’s still possible for a hacker
to work from home, they will most often have to hoof it alongside the rest of
the team and take on devices and intranets as they come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like it happens with Shadowrun 1e, a lot of criticism of this model comes
from a mismatch between the person’s understanding of the modern (2023) Internet
and the model they used to build the Matrix in the books. It’s a bit worse here
both because of the usual edition warrior shenanigans, and because the
differences are more obscure. On the bright side it’s a lot easier to change the
explanation behind the Matrix to a 2023-current one here than it would be to do
the same to Shadowrun 1e’s 80s extravaganza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacker characters are called, well, hackers. They use powerful commlinks and a
suite of specialized software to hack mesh-connected devices. Most often this
means some peripheral or commlink-level device like a camera, alarm, door or
handy pieces of scenery like unattended cars and other things that can be used
to ruin an enemy’s day. It can also mean hacking into a big nexus to steal data
and generally do the same things you could do back in SR 1. All devices are
described by the same set of attributes, and use the same types of programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuff like memory, storage, file sizes, and download speeds are still
considerations in the fiction, but they don’t get detailed rules. Unless the GM
judges a given chunk of data is too large, you can download it in one turn and
store it in your commlink. Some really huge files might take multiple turns to
download or might not fit your storage at all, and the GM decides when that’s
the case based on common sense. You don’t need to worry about storing your run’s
paydata, but you also can’t try to get cute and download the entire public
Matrix into a talking teddy bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking a device means obtaining illicit access to a user account inside it. If
you have set of legitimate credentials for your target account then you don’t
need to roll anything. Otherwise you can gain access by either &lt;em&gt;probing&lt;/em&gt; the
device over a period of hours or days, or by &lt;em&gt;hacking on the fly&lt;/em&gt;. The latter is
an aggressive approach that happens in combat time and carries a much higher
risk of detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking can be done in AR or VR. There are several advantages to doing it in VR,
and even more for doing it with the safety limiters turned off (a condition
known as “hot sim”). Hot sim is the preferred way to hack important nodes, but
it also leaves you vulnerable to lethal damage from Black Ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of user account. Standard accounts can view and mess with
their own data and perform basic functions of the device. Security accounts have
access to more sensitive functions and thus are more protected. And
administrator accounts are the most protected and have full control of
everything. Individual nodes in adventure descriptions should also include a
description of which account tiers they support and what those let users do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible to use a technique called “spoofing” to send single commands
to nearby devices by pretending to be someone who’s authorized to do so. This is
probably what you’re going to use for one-off environmental fuckery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no Hacking Pool here, but all characters can spend Edge to boost any
roll by doing things like rerolling failed dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in this series our Hacker will be joining the physical team
on-site. In this game, it’s common for a site to have more than one server, and
for the really important ones to be isolated from the outside Matrix. This means
the servers containing our main mission objectives can’t be hacked remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual the core book provides us with a very handy sample Hacker which we can
use for our run. This one’s an ork dude with an implanted commlink with all
attributes at 5 and a full set of programs whose ratings vary between 2
and 5. His skills vary between 4 and 5 too. He’s better at sneaking around than
at cybercombat, so we should take care not to trigger any alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a ready-made target site for him to hack, but I found this &lt;a href=&quot;https://pavao.org/shadowrun/miscellany/example_matrix.pdf&quot;&gt;free
document&lt;/a&gt; with some example sites and I’m going to take inspiration from
this, from the SR1 mainframe, and from what little I know of real life to design
a target network. Here it goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This company has a public site but that doesn’t get stats here because it’s
hosted in some cloud provider elsewhere. It has an internal office network for
its day to day business, separated from the Matrix by a beefy firewall. The
firewall node is also not relevant to us because we’re hacking the site from the
inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll treat the entire office network as a single node: System 4, Response 4,
Firewall 3, Analyze 2. User-level accounts allow each user to perform their
daily work. The company’s accountant has a Security account that can access and
manipulate the company’s money, and we need to breach it in order to steal that
money. The network’s standard ice has Pilot 3, Analyze 3, Attack 3, Armor 3, and
triggers when the node detects any unauthorized access. There’s another piece of
ice here (Pilot 4, Analyze 4, Stealth 4, Track 4) that gets activated if the
system detects unauthorized access to the security-tier account. It tries to
trace the intruder’s connection and notifies the authorities when it succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separate from the internal network, there is a security server in charge of
alarms, cameras, badges and lockable doors. User accounts in this server let
employee badges open some doors, but not the one that leads to the record
room. Security accounts let their user operate alarms and cameras. The security
server has its own wireless signal that covers the entire office, but it doesn’t
connect to any other server and accounts on other hosts aren’t valid here. We
want at least a Security account to perform most of our objectives. If the
hacker is on site they might also try to spoof the individual devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security server has System 4, Response 4, Firewall 4, Analyze 4. Its ice,
which activates when an intruder is detected, has Pilot 4, Blackout 4,
Armor 4. Any guards currently connected might also be alerted to the
intruder. The server operates in hidden mode, so our hacker needs to find it
before trying to hack it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameras, alarms and doors attached to the security server all have Device
Ratings of 3 and can be individually hacked or spoofed. Employee badges have
Device Ratings of 2. All are subscribed to the security server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret file server containing the evidence is located in the records
room. It has no wireless interface at all, only a cable jack and a physical
terminal. It has the same stats as the Security server: all stats at 4 plus
Analyze 4. Its ice has Pilot 4, Black Hammer 4, and Armor 4, and is of course
illegal for the target to possess. It has only security and admin accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackaton: Cyberpunk 2020</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/cp2020-cover.jpg&quot;
        alt=&quot;The cover of Cyberpunk 2020&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     I used to think this guy on the cover was so cool.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this post, we’ll be using Cyberpunk 2020 Version 2.01, published in 1993 if
I understood the copyright notice correctly. The original edition of Cyberpunk
was from 1988. Cyberpunk 2020 came out in 1990, and this version only adds minor
corrections on top of that. I’m given to understand the rules themselves didn’t
change much from the original edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to own a physical copy of this corebook back when I was a teenager, so I
also get a bit of cozy nostalgia for looking at the PDF of it now, but I would
definitely not play it as written today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting’s global network is called the Net, or sometimes the NET in all
caps. I’ve heard claims that it doesn’t take inspiration from Neuromancer, but
the description I’m reading here leans as much into Neuromancer imagery as
Shadowrun’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacker characters are called Netrunners, and they use devices called cyberdecks
that range from the size of a desktop workstation to the size of a paperback
book, with a lot of plugs for neural interfaces and data lines but no built-in
keyboard or monitor. Decks all have the same starting stats, but smaller and
more portable models are more expensive. The most expensive deck is the only one
that has a built-in cellular modem. All the others need to jack into landlines
or directly into target devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most expensive decks are cheaper than a subcompact car, and they get much
more affordable if you give up that cellular modem. However netrunners are still
a specialized niche because Cyberpunk 2020 is a class-based system. Netrunner is
a specific class (or “Role”), and only they get the Interface skill that’s used
for hacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Shadowrun’s Matrix uses mainframes as the “backing” for its sci-fi chrome
flash, behind CP 2020’s flash is yet more flash with a dash of space magic. The
overall Net still works kinda like a phone grid, but the book works very hard to
make the reader see it as, effectively, a parallel dimension. Back in 2014 some
researchers effectively cast a spell over the telecom grid and turned it into a
“conceptual space” where each phone line and connected device is located in a
point analogous to its physical location. When you connect to the Net you form
an “ICON” (all caps) representing yourself at the point of entry, and accessing
other servers means making that ICON actually travel the distance between its
entry point and the destination. If you’re in Night City and your destination is
in Japan, there’s no way to reach it except hopping into a Long Distance Link
and flying over the entire Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are serious musings about how the “empty space” you fly over while
traversing these links is teeming with unindentified greeblies because every
computer is on the Net by simply being turned on. If it doesn’t have a
connection, it’s still on the Net, it’s just unreachable from the telecom
grid. Adding new connected systems “physically increases” the size of the Net,
and you could extend it to space by launching a server in a spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of talk about local and regional telecom grids, much like in
Shadowrun, and a big emphasis on paying your phone bill for your home landline
or cellular modem, because CP 2020 never loses an opportunity to joke about
militarized debt collection squads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reasons to run the Net are to provide support to a physical team, and
to recover data from a target server. We can surprisingly already see the image
of the netrunner who stays together with their team here and hacks a series of
remotely controlled devices, doing stuff like controlling robot cars or opening
doors without having to do a full run. However only some PCs will be able to do
this out of the gate, since they might not have the cash for that cellular
portable deck. Oh, and this is an 80s cell, so moving too fast will break your
link. No 5G for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who can, there’s a series of control programs designed for different
types of device. Anything that can be described as “computer controlled” can be
hacked this way if the PC has the appropriate program, since due to SPACE MAGIC,
everything computerized is automatically in the Net. There are also programs for
remaining hidden, getting past barriers, and attacking both other programs and
other people. Everyone is going to want these even if they’re using a desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The netrunner’s Interface class skill is required to run the Net at all, but is
not used for all netrunning tasks. Its main use is in combat against security
programs (IC, “ice”) or other netrunners. Due to the way the character creation
system works it also determines your starting money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of server you expect a netrunner to hack is called a Data Fortress. It
vaguely resembles a mainframe, but as the name implies it goes all in on the VR
Dungeon aesthetic, even harder than Shadowrun did. You’re not moving through an
abstract representation of a mainframe, you’re crawling an actual dungeon-like
structure drawn on a 10x10 square grid. It has walls, gates, and security
programs acting like wandering monsters, and memory banks that work like
treasure chests. They have CPUs that act like brains, and give them an INT score
and possibly skills that are useful both in its day-to-day operations and when
fighting netrunners.  A Fortress with an INT of 12 or higher (which requires 4
CPUs) is a sapient AI and has a personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security programs are drawn from the same master list as netrunner
programs. You place them like monsters in the dungeon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly CP 2020 does not include sample characters, so we have to create
one. We’ll also need to create our target system, because the example there is a
bit too high level for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-netrunner-g0blin&quot;&gt;Our Netrunner: G0blin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So called because of his looks, he prefers to work from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/10/23/on-cyberpsychosis.html&quot;&gt;my Cyberware Capacity rules&lt;/a&gt; instead of Humanity, but that’s the only
tweak I did here. I lucked out on the starting stat and cash rolls and decided
to optimize my money by getting a desktop with expanded memory instead of a
portable deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INT&lt;/strong&gt; 10 &lt;strong&gt;REF&lt;/strong&gt; 9 &lt;strong&gt;TECH&lt;/strong&gt; 7 &lt;strong&gt;LUCK&lt;/strong&gt; 6
&lt;strong&gt;EMP&lt;/strong&gt; 6  &lt;strong&gt;MA&lt;/strong&gt; 5  &lt;strong&gt;COOL&lt;/strong&gt; 4 &lt;strong&gt;BODY&lt;/strong&gt; 4
&lt;strong&gt;ATTR&lt;/strong&gt; 3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyberware Capacity&lt;/strong&gt;: 11/40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/hackaton-cp2020-system.png&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Our target system
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following the rules in the CP2020 core book, and with a little help from its
random generation system, I came up with the Data Fortress depicted above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the key to the numbers and symbols in the file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1: Watchdog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2: Bloodhound&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3: Stun&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4: Knockout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;M*: Financial File, where the money is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;M**: Grey Ops file, where the evidence is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Knockout was a originally a Hellhound, but I thought that might be a bit
excessive since the book keeps describing it as the scariest thing ever, only
employed by the richest and nastiest corporations. Still, there’s not much
difference for us, as one hit from the Knockout will still ensure a mission
failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G0blin arrived from the left side of the screen. The Watchdog next to the gate
spotted him when he got close despite the running Stealth program. He destroyed
it with one attack, and then proceeded to crack the gate. Inside, he first went
right to the remotes and got spotted by another Watchdog. As before, he won
initiative and destroyed it with one attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he moved down, clipping through the CPU. He managed to stay hidden from
both the Bloodhound and the much more dangerous Stun, bushwhacking them with
sneak attacks. He examined the data stores there and drained the company’s
accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he went into the little corner room for the final leg of the mission. The
Knockout program didn’t spot him at first, but also didn’t go down with the
sneak attack. They went to initiative, G0blin won, and finished the program
off. This left him free to finish the mission, as both the door and evidence
were right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The run succeeded and took a total of around 21 game turns and 32 minutes of
real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-analysis-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Run Analysis and Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this less enjoyable than Shadowrun’s system, I guess, but it’s mostly
because of me. I’m not a big fan of how this game views the Net, or of how much
a net run resembles a roguelike dungeon crawl. Nevertheless it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do wonder if the quick runtime might have been because this host was too
easy. How would it have gone if I used the Militech regional office that comes
as an example as my system for this run? Or maybe I got something wrong when
designing the fortress or running the session?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume I got things right and the physical team takes the same amount of
time from the SR1 post to do their part (50 minutes for a perfectly stealthy run
or 90 for one with a firefight). This means the hacker takes up anywhere from a
third to half the session. That’s still more than the theoretic “ideal” ratio of
25%, but perhaps it could be alleviated with a bit of proper scene management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as VR dungeon crawls go, CP 2020’s are much more like brutal raids than
Shadowrun’s careful sneaking missions. Non-combat programs add only their
Strength to the d10 roll, while attacks and defenses use the netrunner’s INT and
Interface skill as well. Attacks are also much more devastating, since most
programs have a Strength of less than 6, and that 1d6 damage Killer programs do
reduces Strength directly. Even if the target survives, it’s greatly weakened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if any of those anti-personnel programs had managed to act
and hit our runner, they’d instantly be put out of commission and the mission
would fail. That’s another way in which it resembles a roguelike: the key to
victory is to bump the monster before the monster bumps you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several things that were unclear to me here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do detection rolls happen only once, or do they happen every turn? I went with
“every turn”, and this ended up making things more violent. Most ICE that
initially missed G0blin ended up spotting him on the second roll and forcing him
to enter combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you need control programs to operate those remote icons from a data fortress?
I went with “no” despite buying a couple of those for G0blin, because the
examples were all about netrunners controlling physical objects close to them
from meatspace. If I had went with “yes”, it would only have increased the
amount of turns the run took by a bit, since G0blin only tried to control these
remotes when all neighboring ICE had been killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also didn’t know what happened when a Watchdog spotted G0blin. Text said it
“alerts its owner”, but does that happen immediately or does the dog have to run
to where the owner is? I judged the program had to travel to the owner since the
setting places so much emphasis on the “physicality” of the Net. That would be
the terminal icon here in our map, but no dog ever made it there. If any had, we
might have seen an enemy netrunner here and the run would have perhaps been
harder.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackaton: Shadowrun 1st Edition Play Phase</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/sr1-cover.jpg&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Our target system
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/10/26/hackaton-sr1-1.html&quot;&gt;deciding on the design parameters&lt;/a&gt; for our Shadowrun 1st Edition
Matrix run, I got my stopwatch and jumped right into it. I stopped it at the end
of every node to keep a running tally of the elapsed time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the system map we’re using, for reference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/hackaton-sr1-system.png&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Our target system
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the account of events. As I mentioned before, the actual timed run was
written in a brief shorthand and the account below was expanded for readability
after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-1-san-red-3-trace-and-dump-4&quot;&gt;Node 1 (SAN): Red-3, Trace and Dump-4.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Decker enters through Node 1, dialing the mainframe’s modem. Security here
is unusually tight for a Shadowrun system - the target really doesn’t want
anyone sticking their noses in his business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t quite understood the rules here yet, thinking that you couldn’t use
your Hacking Pool outside of cybercombat for anything but improvising programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our decker arrives here at Sensor range, improvises Analyze-7 with her pool,
and runs that against the ICE, seeing that it’s a potentially dangerous
tracer. She moves into Contact range and I roll Initiative even though we’re not
in combat, just to have a sense of the flow of the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She runs Sleaze against the Tracer using only the program rating, beating the
ice but failing anyway because this is a Red node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that point on I learn that you can use Hacking Pool dice on any Computer or
program test even outside of combat, so I use some on the second attempt and
pass even though that has increased difficulty. Ice supressed, we get to whisper
“I’m in” into our comms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is where I realize there’s very little reason to be sparing with those
pool dice, and that I can use pool dice even for tests with improvised
programs. So my strategy for pretty much the rest of the run is to shout I AM
SPEED and drop my entire Hacking Pool on any test that doesn’t happen during
actual cybercombat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed so far: 1 turn, 13 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-2-spu-orange-5-access-6&quot;&gt;Node 2 (SPU): Orange-5, Access-6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another beefy node, and our actual password prompt. Our Decker analyzes the Ice
like before, and this fails with a tie. I rule a tie doesn’t activate the
ICE. She decides not to try again and just tries Sleaze instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I AM SPEED gets us through this just fine - Sleaze works against everything, but
Deception would have worked here too. We can see two other nodes from this one,
but not what they are. I decide to flip a coin to see where we go next, and we
go right towards Node 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed so far: 2 turns, 28 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-3-spu-green-4-barrier-3&quot;&gt;Node 3: SPU, Green-4, Barrier-3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I arrive at my final interpretation for improvised
programs. Improvising them is part of the same action in which you run them, so
while this takes only 1 action total, the pool dice you use for the script
aren’t available for the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily Analyze’s rating doesn’t actually limit what it can discover, so we’re
better off improvising an Analyze-1 script and chucking our remaining 13 pool
dice into the test than going for Analyze-7 with 1 extra die. Having an actual
Analyze program would be even better, but this is pretty good still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our reckless Decker successfully analyzes the ICE and Sleazes past it using
the same actions and approach as before. I AM SPEED wins again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She sees there are two connected nodes, and it’s right here that I realize she’s
not actually in any danger at Sensor range and can back out after
reconnoitering. So Ms. Decker moves into Sensor range of the two connected nodes
in order to scout them all and see they’re an I/O Port and a Control node
without any ICE in them. She then decides to move on to Node 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed: 5 turns, 41 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-4-io-port-green-4&quot;&gt;Node 4: I/O Port, Green-4.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This node and Node 5 don’t actually have a security rating of their own, so I
gave them the same rating as the SPU that was linked to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We once again go with I AM SPEED, and our total of 21 dice easily takes care of
the system operation needed to disable the camera. Per the rules, after either
succeeding at a system operation or giving up after a number of failures, we
need to roll a d6. If the result is less than or equal to the number of
attempts, the system noticed something wrong and triggered an alert. We only had
one attempt before succeeding, and we roll a 3, so no alert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camera is off. First goal accomplished!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed: 6 turns, 47 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-5-control-green-4&quot;&gt;Node 5: Control, Green-4.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same deal as before, and same outcome. Alarm is off, second goal
accomplished. And we took less time because I already knew what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed: 7 turns, 50 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-6-spu-red-4-killer-4&quot;&gt;Node 6: SPU, Red-4, Killer-4.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have data to steal, so we go to the only unexplored path so far and try
to find data stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After scouting the node, we follow your usual procedure of Improvised Analyze -&amp;gt;
close to Contact range -&amp;gt; Initiative -&amp;gt; Sleaze, always using our whole Hacking
Pool for each individual test. We suppress the ICE without issue. If you noticed
how reckless we’re being, take a cookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further scouting reviews two data stores attached to this node. I flip another
coin to decide where to go, and we go down to Node 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed: 10 turns, 58 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-8-data-store-red-4-black-ice-5&quot;&gt;Node 8: Data Store, Red-4, Black Ice-5.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our usual Improvised Analyze routine shows us this data store is protected by
Black Ice! This is scary, but is also a very promising lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disregarding the danger, our Decker goes all in and chucks her whole Hacking
Pool into Sleaze again. She succeeds by exactly the needed amount and suppresses
the ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then uses Browse to find any drainable accounts, because she doesn’t know
the full layout of the system like we do. The operation succeeds but she doesn’t
find anything. Boo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remembering the actual mission, she Browses for incriminating evidence and finds
it. She has enough disk space for the file, and no time pressure for the
download, so we just wait a couple more turns. Third objective accomplished!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She still wants to find that money, though, so she moves to the other data store
at Node 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed: 13 turns, 1 hour, 9 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-7-data-store-red-4-access-5&quot;&gt;Node 7: Data Store, Red-4, Access-5&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same deal as usual. Improv Analyze reveals the ICE, Sleaze gets past it, Browse
confirms there’s nothing of value to the team in this node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where I begin to notice that despite the different types of nodes and
the flowery descriptions of virtual dungeons, we’ve been performing more or less
the same sequence of tests in the same order, in a loop. So I guess a long
enough Matrix run might seem a bit boring for the decker as well. I’m still
having fun &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, because lucky rolls have given me a string of successes, but
I don’t feel like I’m in danger or having to make complex decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the only unexplored node left is the CPU. A cautious decker might decide
to cut their losses, perform the single remaining system operation they need,
and jack out. But we’ve already established our Decker is not cautious, SHE IS
SPEED!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total elapsed time: 14 turns, 1 hour, 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-9-cpu-red-5-trace-and-burn-6-black-ice-4&quot;&gt;Node 9: CPU, Red-5, Trace and Burn-6, Black Ice-4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup is a little unusual here. This CPU has all the standard system
operations available, and the Trace and Burn-6 is protecting those. It also has
a link to the target’s bank account, and draining it counts as a custom system
operation. There’s a piece of Black Ice protecting that operation only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our Decker will have the run of the system if she neutralizes the Tracer, but
to get the money she must also get past the Black Ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She comes within Sensor Range, Improv-Analyzes both pieces of Ice, and sees what
they’re protecting. She decides to deal with the Tracer first. I roll Initiative
for everyone as she gets into Contact Range, but the ICE will only act if it
activates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the usual I AM SPEED approach giving us 19 dice to Sleaze past the
Tracer, the node’s high security level prevents us from succeeding. We try again
with increased difficulty, and this time a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unlucky roll gives the ice
more successes, meaning it activates!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing Trace and Burn does upon activation is try to raise an Internal
Alert in the system. This causes the ratings of all ICE to increase by 50%, so
we’re actually dealing with Trace-and-Burn 9 now. The Black Ice also improves to
Rating 6, but it remains inactive since it’s only protecting the bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could have allocated dice from our Hacking Pool to an opposed test to “jam”
the ice and prevent the alert from going through… but we already used all of
them on the Sleaze attempt, and the pool hasn’t refreshed yet. This is why our
Decker has been very reckless so far, as every piece of ice she faced until now
could have done this on a failed test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its first actual action, Trace and Burn rolls its rating to determine how
long it will take to trace the Decker. We’re lucky here because this roll gets
only 1 success, meaning it will take a total of 10 of the IC’s actions to do
so. Once that time is up, though, her deck is toast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Decker switches to using the Attack program to destroy the Tracer before
that happens. This is proper cybercombat, which works a little differently. The
“to-hit” roll is an unopposed test with only with your Hacking Pool against the
Node’s security. The program’s rating is your base damage if you hit, and it
increases by 1 for every extra success past the minimum required to hit. Actual
damage is your net successes in an opposed test of the ICE’s rating versus your
damage pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I end up using my entire pool in the to-hit roll, since any less than that means
I won’t be beating the difficulty on average. It takes me 3 turns to destroy the
Tracer this way, but since everyone acts multiple times per turn I only had 3
actions left before the trace completed. This was still somewhat repetitive
since it was the same set of rolls every time, but it was also exciting since
this is the first time our Decker is in any actual danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the tracer gone, she uses a system operation to cancel the alert and
manages to Sleaze past the Black Ice and drain the target’s account. Bonus
objective completed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that done, she moves normally to the Control Modules and opens the final
door, completing the mission’s objective. She then jacks out. Mission Complete!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed: 19 turns, 2 hours and 4 minutes. This combat alone took 41
minutes to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-analysis-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Run Analysis and Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not gonna lie, I kinda feel like I completed an important life goal. I could
never understand this hacking system when I was 12, but now not only did I grok
it, I finished an entire Matrix run while using it. So I’m pretty happy, and I
had fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I must also conclude that all the criticisms leveled at this system are
valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the intro, we’re assuming our physical team has an easy time
getting past the reception area. This would take some light roleplaying and a
roll or two from our talker. That plus walking to the restricted area might take
10 minutes of real time, but it takes the decker 50 minutes to complete the
goals that let them move forward from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part of the physical mission will involve more tests and die rolls from
the physical team. The Decker takes around half an hour of real time to find the
electronic evidence, and it might be accurate to assume the physical team takes
about the same or a little bit longer to sneak past the guards and find the
physical documents. Let’s say 40 minutes for the physical team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the Decker decides to loot the server, and that takes 41 minutes. Unless
the physical team is having an epic shootout at the same time as they try to
leave the building, all they have to do is sit and wait. Otherwise they take
maybe 10 minutes total to reach the back door and walk out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a team that has a firefight on the way out might take up 90 minutes of real
time, and a team that doesn’t will take perhaps 50 with their part of the
mission. Our Decker is taking up &lt;em&gt;at best&lt;/em&gt; over half and at worst over
two-thirds of the session with her solo VR dungeon crawl. And this is all
assuming a 100% buttery smooth session with absolutely no digressions,
distractions, or rule arguments to make it longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a point where I kinda felt that the decking run itself was
getting a little repetitive, because the “optimal” procedure to follow became
obvious: Improv Analyze -&amp;gt; Sleaze, always dumping the entire Hacking Pool into
each test. In actual cybercombat, I also ended up doing the same thing over and
over until the enemy died. It was still enjoyable, but I could see it eventually
overstaying its welcome even for the decker player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if it turns out that my rules interpretations were overly generous and
this was supposed to be way harder, then all the criticisms I made become even
stronger, because everything would take more time and more rolls.&lt;/p&gt;
