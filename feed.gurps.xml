        alt=&quot;The cover of Cyberpunk RED&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     I still think this cover is cool.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/11/03/hackaton-cp-red.html&quot;&gt;both our netrunner and the systems she needs to hack&lt;/a&gt;, we can
start the actual run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G0blin Jr. goes in with the physical team, they get past the reception, and as
the rest of the team pretends to work she locks herself in the bathroom to try
and hack the security server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are cheating a bit here, because it turns out you need to be within six
meters &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; within line of sight of an access point to hack the corresponding
architecture. I don’t want to actually map the whole office out like I would in
a real adventure, so we’re kind of assuming the wireless networks here have the
same coverage as in the SR 4 version. They want to track where all guards and
guests are at all times so there are security server access points in each room,
covering the whole office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G0blin Junior’s strategy is to be meticulous and defeat each piece of ice as it
comes up, to avoid having them pile up on her. Still, even a meticulous approach
looks like a brutal all-out-assault here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;security-server&quot;&gt;Security Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior has no problem dealing with the Skunk ice at the top layer in the first
turn. She then uses the Pathfinder net ability to see deeper into the server and
rolls well enough to see the whole thing, even past the Password wall. She now
knows the exact route she must take - down the left branch to disable the alarm
and camera, and all the way down the right branch to unlock the back door and
plant a Virus to keep these things disabled after she logs out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick peek at the files on level 3 sees they’re worthless, and then it’s on to
the main event: the fight against the Hellhound/Killer pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She beats the Hellhound in the contested roll, but loses to the Killer and so
loses a program at random: the Eraser. It’s completely destroyed. We’ll be
generous and assume she has backed-up copies at home, but they can’t be restored
within this run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fearing for her software more than for her brain, Junior focuses her attacks
this first turn on the Killer, destroying it after 2 Sword attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we’re in for a slugging match with the Hellhound. It attacks once per
turn but always goes first, with Junior spending her 3 net actions per turn on
two Sword attacks and one Zap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good roll by the Hellhound in the following turn deals only 3 damage to Junior
(thanks to her Armor program), but also sets her on fire. She will begin taking
2 points of damage per turn until she spends a Meat Action to deal with
that. And she can’t afford to spend any Meat Actions now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A series of bad rolls on her part mean she misses her first turn of attacks, so
has to take more burn damage next turn. Fortunately the Hellhound fails to
damage her, and she can finish it off then. But she needs to wait for another
turn and 2 more burn points to be able to put out the fire: you cannot spend a
Meat Action in a turn where you spend Net Actions and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior is down a program and 20% of her HP so far. Fortunately she doesn’t have
any problem going down the Architecture’s left branch and disabling the alarm
and camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Skunk at the top of the right branch doesn’t give her any trouble. Turns out
Skunks are harmless when fought alone. The Asp in the next level beats the
initiative contest and destroys her Armor program, though it goes down to the
usual Sword, Sword, Zap combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior reaches the bottom of the security server, unlocks the door, and spends 2
Net Actions creating a Virus that will keep the security devices off after she
logs out. She then Cloaks her efforts and jacks out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time taken for the security server: 19 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secret-server&quot;&gt;Secret Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly singed G0blin Jr. follows her teammates to the records room and jacks
into the secret server she finds there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The password is a breeze to blow through, and a good Pathfinder roll lets her
see all the way to the bottom of the server. The Skunk is easily defeated by
turn 3 of this hack. The Wisp loses initiative and goes down before it can
act. The Hellhound wins initiative and further burns out poor netrunner’s brain,
leaving her with 17 remaining HP since she has no more Armor program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She manages to kill it with lucky Sword strikes before it can attack again, but
has to take 2 burn damage and spend a Meat Action extinguishing the fire. She
successfully IDs the evidence file and copies it. She knows there’s a Killer
further down but she’s hurt and down 2 programs, so she doesn’t risk engaging it
in order to cover her tracks. Junior jacks out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time for this hack: 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team has fulfilled their mission, but unlike the hackers of every other
game, G0blin Jr. decides discretion is the better part of valor. She’s
half-dead, down two very important programs, and that office net might have
another Hellhound like the two others she jacked into today (it doesn’t, but the
doesn’t know that). Plus there’s a chance that a firefight is ongoing in the
meat world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team leaves with the evidence, but without the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior deciding to give on the money and just leave is the sensible roleplaying
choice. All netrunners are brave folks by definition, but someone who names
herself after a goblin would probably not be &lt;em&gt;suicidally&lt;/em&gt; brave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-what-if-she-was&quot;&gt;But What If She Was?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if our Goblin had decided to brave the office network in her present state,
after all? What if she had thrown caution to the wind, messaged WITNESS ME to
her companions, and dove in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would have succeeded in 10 minutes, but just barely. The Asp takes out both
her Sword programs, and two max damage rolls from the Wisp leave her with a
measly 3 HP before she could derezz it and drain the office accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Junior is probably not making it out of the office if any sort of fight
erupts. And if she does a good chunk of that money is going to pay for her
hospital bills. Her teammates will probably begin calling her “Crispy” if she
survives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Time Elapsed&lt;/strong&gt;: 29 minutes if she doesn’t go for the money, 39 (and a
lot of pain) if she does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;analysis-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Analysis and Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;29 minutes is well within our tolerance for a manageable amount of time, so we
can say that CP RED’s system remains fast. It took around 12 minutes for Junior
to disable the camera and alarm, which is about what I consider the upper limit
on the time you can keep the rest of the team waiting. You could cut to the
physical team at that time and go turn by turn to keep everyone moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disabling the door has to happen in the same hack because the system resets when
the netrunner jacks out, but that’s an additional 7 minutes so it’s OK. The
secret server hack takes 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going for the “easy” office server after being beaten up by the first two does
indeed border on the suicidal. It’s fast at 10 minutes, but not worth
it. Cutting your losses and leaving is a perfectly rational decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because ye &lt;em&gt;gawds&lt;/em&gt; is this system brutal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stealth is not a thing in these rules. The closest thing is the Slide ability,
but that apparently only works to escape combat, not to avoid it. Most ICE
threatens to either permanently destroy your programs or directly damage your
HP, and if I understood the rules directly they get a free and automatic hit
against you if they beat that contested initiative roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So avoiding combat is impossible, and getting out unscathed is extremely
unlikely. I feared I made the CP 2020 data fortress too easy, and here I think I
made things too difficult by having three decent-sized Architectures generated
with the random system. It looks like CP RED wants a single big Architecture per
adventure instead of a bunch of scattered smaller ones. If there are smaller
ones, they should be &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; with at most a single piece of ICE or Demon, to help
preserve the netrunner for the main event.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/cp-red-cover.png&quot;
        alt=&quot;The cover of Cyberpunk RED&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     I still think this cover is cool.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we’ll take a look at Cyberpunk RED, the current edition of
Cyberpunk-the-game. It’s meant to be the followup to Cyberpunk 2020, and in a
nice bit of synchronicity it was published in 2020. It’s kind of a companion
piece to the Cyberpunk 2077 computer game, since according to the foreword the
two works started being made at around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CP RED provides what the critics of previously attempted 2020 sequels most
wanted: more of the same. It takes the 2020 setting forward to 2045 by
essentially doing a copy-and-paste on the timeline to extend it, so you have a
&lt;em&gt;new and improved&lt;/em&gt; ecological collapse, a &lt;em&gt;new and improved&lt;/em&gt; corp war that
leaves plenty of cybered-up veterans, and so on. Of course, it’s not an exact
copy and a lot of things are different, but the tone is almost exactly the same
as 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that underwent a big change was the Net, which we’ll look at
now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Net of Cyberpunk RED contains about the same amount of space magic as its
2020 ancestor, but it looks different. Somewhere around 2023 or so, iconic
netrunner Rache Bartmoss releases a bunch of data-destroying rabid AIs into the
old Net. They do so much damage that the authorities who oversee the old telecom
grid decide to shut it down entirely, in the process undoing the spell that made
the use of virtual reality possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays there’s still the notion that the Net is a parallel dimension, but it’s
a dangerous and fractured one. Each city has their own small Net realm, isolated
from the world by firewalls, and in between you have the wild and wooly domains
of rogue AIs and demon programs. Why do we need firewalls to keep them at bay if
there are no physical lines connecting them to us any more? Shut up, that’s
why. Any similarity between this and Shadowrun’s deep astral planes is probably
a coincidence, which is kind of a waste in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the city nets, someone came up with a new spell in 2035 that once again
let people see the virtual aspect of the Net in a simplified form. Now you can
put on a set of “Virtuality” goggles and see the parallel dimension of the Net
overlaid over the physical world, with every connected object having a
corresponding icon. The main difference here is that more things have icons, and
you can no longer leave your body behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard users mostly use the city nets through devices called Agents, which are
a bit like slightly smarter smartphones. They can use these for pretty much
everything we’d use the Internet for, except that they’re just accessing the
local city net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers are still called netrunners, and they still use cyberdecks. The servers
they hack are named Architectures, and can represent any device complex enough
to be the target of a netrun, not just mainframes. Due to the even stronger
“parallel dimension” metaphor here, you can only hack an Architecture if you’re
within about six meters of one of its physical access points. Netrunners can no
longer work from home. Devices not complex enough to warrant an Architecture
(including Agents) can be tampered with using electronics skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers are still named netrunners. To do their job they need the Interface
skill, interface plugs, “Virtuality” glasses and a cyberdeck. Cyberdecks in RED
look like their portable ancestors in 2020 and come in three generic tiers that
differ by the number of Option Slots they have (5, 6 or 7). Each Option Slot
lets you install a program or hardware expansion in your deck. Decks are not
uniquely expensive - their prices are in line with other types of specialist
gear in the book. Once you earn more money you can perhaps buy an armored
jumpsuit with a deck compartment that gives it an extra slot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most actions you can perform in a netrun can be done with the Interface skill
alone, including a basic attack. The roll is almost always 1d10 + Interface
against a difficulty set by the Architecture you’re hacking. Programs come in
three categories: “boosters” that can give bonuses to some of those basic rolls,
“attackers” that act as better weapons than your basic attack, and “defenders”
that reduce or negate damage while they’re active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netrunning happens faster than physical combat. Characters only get one “meat
action” per turn, but netrunners get a number of “Net actions” proportional to
their Interface skill. Some net tasks require meat actions, but you can’t use
net actions to do physical tasks. Programs that need to be actively used take a
net action to activate and can only be used once per turn, so there’s an
advantage to having multiple copies of the same attack program
loaded. Controlling a physical device takes a Net action, but each device can
only perform one action per turn as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Architectures are relatively abstract and modeled as tables. Each row in the
table is a level in the architecture, and it contains one thing. That thing
could be a file, a controllable device, or a security program. Netrunners start
at level 1 and can move down one level at a time. They don’t know what’s in a
level until they get there for the first time, and possibly pass some tests to
analyze the thing they find. If it’s a security program, it will prevent them
from descending further until dealt with. The stuff they want to steal or
sabotage tends to be in the middle or lower levels of an architecture, protected
by a few security layers. They can move through already-explored layers freely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security programs range from password barriers to Black Ice, which is very
dangerous and can move through the architecture to chase a netrunner. It’s
pretty much a monster that you need to fight or die trying. Netrunners can also
run Black Ice from their decks, and order them to kill other netrunners or
programs in combat, but they take up 2 slots instead of 1. Black Ice tends to
attack right away - forget stealth for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another type of security program is the Demon, whose main purpose is to control
physical devices like turrets, drones, and traps to fight intruders. They’re
relatively weak at Net combat, but it’s hard to find and destroy a Demon that’s
shooting at your meat with a pair of heavy machine gun turrets…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think there’s a ready-made sample netrunner in the book, but the book
does include all we need to generate a quick-and-dirty one so let’s do that. I
think I do have some supplements that might have suitable ready-made
Architectures that fit our purposes, but if they do not then we can generate
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-netrunner-g0blin-jr-daughter-of-g0blin&quot;&gt;Our Netrunner: G0blin Jr., daughter of G0blin.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proudly carrying on the family tradition. Lazy but lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INT&lt;/strong&gt; 7  &lt;strong&gt;REF&lt;/strong&gt; 6  &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; 7  &lt;strong&gt;TECH&lt;/strong&gt; 7 &lt;strong&gt;COOL&lt;/strong&gt; 6
&lt;strong&gt;WILL&lt;/strong&gt; 3 &lt;strong&gt;LUCK&lt;/strong&gt; 6 &lt;strong&gt;MOVE&lt;/strong&gt; 5 &lt;strong&gt;BODY&lt;/strong&gt; 6 &lt;strong&gt;EMP&lt;/strong&gt; 5&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt;: 35
&lt;strong&gt;Death Save&lt;/strong&gt;: 6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyberware Capacity&lt;/strong&gt;: 14/60&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;skills&quot;&gt;Skills&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interface 4. Other stuff from the Netrunner Street Rat Pack as it becomes
relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyberware&quot;&gt;Cyberware&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neural Link, Interface Plugs, Shift Tacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very Heavy Pistol with 30 rounds&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whole-body Light Armorhack (SP 11)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agent&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cyberdeck (7 slots)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Virtuality Goggles&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Programs: Armor, Sword x 2, Worm, Eraser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clothes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-target-systems&quot;&gt;Our Target Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for our target system, I could have made a single architecture for
everything, and the examples I have here kinda point in that direction, but I
really feel like this would benefit from the same approach as Shadowrun 4th
Edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ll have three Architectures here. One for the office network, one for the
security server, and one for the secret server. All individually small, but the
latter two with somewhat elevated security for their size. I’ll use the random
generator to help me with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Office network is Basic and has 7 levels, Security server is Standard and has 9
with a branch, the secret server is Standard and has 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;office-network&quot;&gt;Office Network:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password DV 6&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File (DV6) - Worthless&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password DV 6&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wisp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File (DV8) -&amp;gt; Accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;security-server&quot;&gt;Security Server&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password DV 8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File DV8 - logs, worthless&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hellhound, Killer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left Branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control DV8 - Camera&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control DV8 - Alarm Sensors, as Camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right Branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control DV8 - Door&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;secret-server&quot;&gt;Secret Server&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Password DV8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skunk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wisp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hellhound&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File DV10 - The Evidence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Killer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll soon see how Junior manages these systems. I relied more on the random
generator here than on my own judgment, it might be that this ends up being too
hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My predictions are: since there is a lot of black ice in there, we’ll see plenty
of combat, but I also expect this to go fast. Either Junior kills everything and
completes the objective, or she dies fairly early while hacking the security
server. Probably while fighting the Killer/Hellhound duo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the worst happens, I’ll adjust the difficulty down a bit and try for a
successful run, timing how long that took.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackaton: Shadowrun 4th Edition, Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/sr4-cover.jpg&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Shadowrun 20th Anniversary's cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After setting up our parameters in the previous post, we start the run here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually ran this one a couple of times, because it took me a bit to fully
internalize the rules. My main mistake was assuming I was familiar with them
already and only reading them superficially to “refresh my memory”. This made me
get some crucial basic facts wrong, causing my first run to be really fast but
incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I made an additional run where I tracked the die rolls accurately and got
detected in one of the hacks. Then I read the rules outside of the Matrix
chapter more closely and made another one where I spent Edge more wisely and
accomplished all goals without being detected. I’m referring to these as the
&lt;strong&gt;loud&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;silent&lt;/strong&gt; runs. They are recorded below as a single account with
notes on how they diverge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;diff-merging-timelines&quot;&gt;Diff-merging Timelines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hacker enters the building with is team. They get past the reception as
usual, receiving temporary badges. Once inside, he feels a “sudden” need to go
to the bathroom, and locks himself inside a stall. He spends a couple of turns
scanning for the badge’s wireless signal, and finds it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then tries to hack into the badge, still using AR because it’s a fragging’
badge. He succeeds quickly. As expected the badge can’t do a lot, but it knows
how to talk to the security server and now so does the hacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hacker then switches to VR and goes hot, after bracing himself so he doesn’t
fall down in the stall. He tries to get himself security-level access because he
knows from examining the badge that user-level accounts do nothing in this
server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where our timelines diverge. In the &lt;strong&gt;loud&lt;/strong&gt; run, he gets in but also
gets detected. The server issues a restricted alert against his persona,
triggers the Blackout ice, and pings the guards. Restricted alert means the
server’s Firewall increases by +4 against the hacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hacker and the IC go into cybercombat, with the hacker winning
initiative. Cybercombat here resembles the SR1 version a bit, though the exact
things you roll are different. With the expenditure of a couple points of Edge,
our hacker manages to destroy the ice at the start of the second combat turn,
without suffering any trauma to his brain meats. Still, in this timeline the
guards are suspicious of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;silent&lt;/strong&gt; run, luckier rolls let the hacker in without being detected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both, the hacker manages to disable the camera and alarm, letting the team
move into the records room. While they perform a physical search for hard
copies, our hacker jacks into the secret isolated server and goes into hot sim
VR again. He manages to get in undetected, though in the &lt;strong&gt;silent&lt;/strong&gt; run he has
to spend the Edge he didn’t spend in combat to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rule that finding the files requires no tests, as this is only a single node
and the existing data search rules are for searching the Matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still in the records room, our hacker decides to be daring and hack the office
network in search of those drainable accounts. This network has a wireless
signal covering the whole office and is quite visible, so he gets right to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, our decker easily hacks himself a user account. From there he runs a
data search on the network’s user directory to find the one who has access to
the bank accounts, and then attempts to gain access to it. I give this a low
Threshold because it’s a small intranet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the accountant’s profile, the hacker attempts to hack into it. That’s
like starting from scratch, this time going for a security account. Again the
hacker manages to get in undetected, and again in the &lt;strong&gt;silent&lt;/strong&gt; run he needs to
spend Edge to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draining the account requires no additional rolls. And since our hacker retained
his account at the security server, unlocking the back door requires no rolls
either. Of course, in the &lt;strong&gt;loud&lt;/strong&gt; timeline there’s a very high chance that
they’re doing this during a firefight, as the guards are extra-suspicious and
would have known to check the records room…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;loud&lt;/strong&gt; run that had cybercombat and an alert took 31 minutes. The
&lt;strong&gt;silent&lt;/strong&gt; one took 17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-analysis-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Run Analysis and Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system is my personal favorite so far, and I had to actively keep myself
from adding little cool bits that kept appearing in my imagination, because I’d
otherwise would have found myself running an entire solo adventure, controlling
the whole team and imagining dialogue in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having “my” character be present with the group certainly helped stir the
imagination, because he wasn’t sitting pretty at home. I had to think about how
he navigated the physical site with the rest of the group, and from where he’d
jack into VR to avoid suspicion, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do love that the system was very fast compared to the other ones so far, but I
wonder how much of that is down to the design of the target nodes. I’d love to
hear about how people design their own adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see how Shadowrun’s system still favors silent runs here. Cybercombat
against even a single instance of ICE takes a while to resolve, and the more of
it there is the longer the run will take. Careless hackers could easily find
themselves having to deal with multiple ICE cubes at once, perhaps even in
different hosts, and that will drastically lower their chances of success. More
advanced rules let hackers run their own agent programs, which helps fighting
the icy hordes but makes things take more real time to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, let’s see how our sample runs here fit with the physical team’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we again assume the physical part of the run takes 50 minutes for a perfectly
stealthy team and 90 minutes with a firefight on the way out, then it’s also
possible to correlate our diverging runs to each of these scenarios. The
perfectly sneaky run would mean a perfectly sneaky hack. The loud run would
almost certainly be caused by that alert we got, unless our talker was &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;
at their job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in the more common silent/silent and loud/loud scenarios, our hacker took up
around 25% of the total session time, which is pretty close to ideal in a
four-player party. In an anomalous loud hack/silent run scenario, they take up a
little under half the run time. And in a silent hack/loud run situation, they
take around 15% of the time hacking the objectives and can spend the rest of
their spotlight time helping out in physical combat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackathon: Shadowrun 4th Edition</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/sr4-cover.jpg&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Shadowrun 20th Anniversary's cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this post we’ll be using Shadowrun 4th Edition, published in 2005. More
specifically, we’ll be using the 20th Anniversary core book published in 2009,
which uses the same base rules as 4th Edition but incorporates errata and some
material that was previously published in supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Shadowrun 1e’s Matrix was inspired by 80s mainframes, then 4th edition’s is
inspired by the Internet as it was in 2005, plus some reasonable extrapolations
of things that were in fashion among futurists then but didn’t necessarily pan
out in the following decades. It does end up looking a lot like what we actually
have here in 2023, with a few important differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of being built around high-speed cell towers, the mobile Matrix is a
ubiquitous wireless mesh network. Individual devices in a mesh cooperate to
route its network traffic without the need for central coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Things was also in fashion, so every object that could possibly
have a use for built-in computing and network capability has that
capability. Most of those devices are fairly limited, but computer hardware is
apparently so cheap and standardized that many of them have unused capacity that
could be repurposed by a clever hacker. One example is someone converting cheap
appliances into mesh routers to to bring connectivity to a “dead zone”. It’s
also easy to turn off a device’s wireless capability with a simple command or in
some cases a physical switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone carries a &lt;em&gt;commlink&lt;/em&gt;, a device that’s equivalent to a real-world
smartphone in form factor and usage. They often connect to a variety of
&lt;em&gt;peripherals&lt;/em&gt;, more limited devices that are built to talk to commlinks and not
to the wider Matrix. These range from augmented-reality glasses to that
smartlinked gun your character owns. A big server of the sort that’s the target
of a hacking run is called a &lt;em&gt;nexus&lt;/em&gt;. I will just say “server” instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Augmented Reality is a big deal here, with most things connected to a mesh
having some sort of AR presence, and general interaction with your commlink and
the Matrix happening through AR interfaces. If you can use AR to help with your
current task you gain a bonus to the roll. Examples include finding your way
around town with that handy videogame-style minimap, overlaying a blueprint and
instructions over the thing you’re fixing, firing a smarlinked gun, finding
someone in a crowd when you have a face-recognition database, and so on. One can
also choose to go “full VR”, which more useful for certain applications (mainly
hacking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secure facilities of the sort shadowrunners are hired to break into have
internal mesh networks. They use tactics like limited signal ranges and
radio-blocking paint to keep their signal contained to the physical space they
service, and might not be connected to the wider Matrix at all. In some the
paydata is going to be in a server that’s only accessible via wired connection
or even via its own terminal. While sometimes it’s still possible for a hacker
to work from home, they will most often have to hoof it alongside the rest of
the team and take on devices and intranets as they come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like it happens with Shadowrun 1e, a lot of criticism of this model comes
from a mismatch between the person’s understanding of the modern (2023) Internet
and the model they used to build the Matrix in the books. It’s a bit worse here
both because of the usual edition warrior shenanigans, and because the
differences are more obscure. On the bright side it’s a lot easier to change the
explanation behind the Matrix to a 2023-current one here than it would be to do
the same to Shadowrun 1e’s 80s extravaganza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacker characters are called, well, hackers. They use powerful commlinks and a
suite of specialized software to hack mesh-connected devices. Most often this
means some peripheral or commlink-level device like a camera, alarm, door or
handy pieces of scenery like unattended cars and other things that can be used
to ruin an enemy’s day. It can also mean hacking into a big nexus to steal data
and generally do the same things you could do back in SR 1. All devices are
described by the same set of attributes, and use the same types of programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuff like memory, storage, file sizes, and download speeds are still
considerations in the fiction, but they don’t get detailed rules. Unless the GM
judges a given chunk of data is too large, you can download it in one turn and
store it in your commlink. Some really huge files might take multiple turns to
download or might not fit your storage at all, and the GM decides when that’s
the case based on common sense. You don’t need to worry about storing your run’s
paydata, but you also can’t try to get cute and download the entire public
Matrix into a talking teddy bear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking a device means obtaining illicit access to a user account inside it. If
you have set of legitimate credentials for your target account then you don’t
need to roll anything. Otherwise you can gain access by either &lt;em&gt;probing&lt;/em&gt; the
device over a period of hours or days, or by &lt;em&gt;hacking on the fly&lt;/em&gt;. The latter is
an aggressive approach that happens in combat time and carries a much higher
risk of detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking can be done in AR or VR. There are several advantages to doing it in VR,
and even more for doing it with the safety limiters turned off (a condition
known as “hot sim”). Hot sim is the preferred way to hack important nodes, but
it also leaves you vulnerable to lethal damage from Black Ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of user account. Standard accounts can view and mess with
their own data and perform basic functions of the device. Security accounts have
access to more sensitive functions and thus are more protected. And
administrator accounts are the most protected and have full control of
everything. Individual nodes in adventure descriptions should also include a
description of which account tiers they support and what those let users do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible to use a technique called “spoofing” to send single commands
to nearby devices by pretending to be someone who’s authorized to do so. This is
probably what you’re going to use for one-off environmental fuckery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no Hacking Pool here, but all characters can spend Edge to boost any
roll by doing things like rerolling failed dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in this series our Hacker will be joining the physical team
on-site. In this game, it’s common for a site to have more than one server, and
for the really important ones to be isolated from the outside Matrix. This means
the servers containing our main mission objectives can’t be hacked remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual the core book provides us with a very handy sample Hacker which we can
use for our run. This one’s an ork dude with an implanted commlink with all
attributes at 5 and a full set of programs whose ratings vary between 2
and 5. His skills vary between 4 and 5 too. He’s better at sneaking around than
at cybercombat, so we should take care not to trigger any alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a ready-made target site for him to hack, but I found this &lt;a href=&quot;https://pavao.org/shadowrun/miscellany/example_matrix.pdf&quot;&gt;free
document&lt;/a&gt; with some example sites and I’m going to take inspiration from
this, from the SR1 mainframe, and from what little I know of real life to design
a target network. Here it goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This company has a public site but that doesn’t get stats here because it’s
hosted in some cloud provider elsewhere. It has an internal office network for
its day to day business, separated from the Matrix by a beefy firewall. The
firewall node is also not relevant to us because we’re hacking the site from the
inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll treat the entire office network as a single node: System 4, Response 4,
Firewall 3, Analyze 2. User-level accounts allow each user to perform their
daily work. The company’s accountant has a Security account that can access and
manipulate the company’s money, and we need to breach it in order to steal that
money. The network’s standard ice has Pilot 3, Analyze 3, Attack 3, Armor 3, and
triggers when the node detects any unauthorized access. There’s another piece of
ice here (Pilot 4, Analyze 4, Stealth 4, Track 4) that gets activated if the
system detects unauthorized access to the security-tier account. It tries to
trace the intruder’s connection and notifies the authorities when it succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separate from the internal network, there is a security server in charge of
alarms, cameras, badges and lockable doors. User accounts in this server let
employee badges open some doors, but not the one that leads to the record
room. Security accounts let their user operate alarms and cameras. The security
server has its own wireless signal that covers the entire office, but it doesn’t
connect to any other server and accounts on other hosts aren’t valid here. We
want at least a Security account to perform most of our objectives. If the
hacker is on site they might also try to spoof the individual devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security server has System 4, Response 4, Firewall 4, Analyze 4. Its ice,
which activates when an intruder is detected, has Pilot 4, Blackout 4,
Armor 4. Any guards currently connected might also be alerted to the
intruder. The server operates in hidden mode, so our hacker needs to find it
before trying to hack it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameras, alarms and doors attached to the security server all have Device
Ratings of 3 and can be individually hacked or spoofed. Employee badges have
Device Ratings of 2. All are subscribed to the security server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret file server containing the evidence is located in the records
room. It has no wireless interface at all, only a cable jack and a physical
terminal. It has the same stats as the Security server: all stats at 4 plus
Analyze 4. Its ice has Pilot 4, Black Hammer 4, and Armor 4, and is of course
illegal for the target to possess. It has only security and admin accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackaton: Cyberpunk 2020</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/cp2020-cover.jpg&quot;
        alt=&quot;The cover of Cyberpunk 2020&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     I used to think this guy on the cover was so cool.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this post, we’ll be using Cyberpunk 2020 Version 2.01, published in 1993 if
I understood the copyright notice correctly. The original edition of Cyberpunk
was from 1988. Cyberpunk 2020 came out in 1990, and this version only adds minor
corrections on top of that. I’m given to understand the rules themselves didn’t
change much from the original edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to own a physical copy of this corebook back when I was a teenager, so I
also get a bit of cozy nostalgia for looking at the PDF of it now, but I would
definitely not play it as written today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting’s global network is called the Net, or sometimes the NET in all
caps. I’ve heard claims that it doesn’t take inspiration from Neuromancer, but
the description I’m reading here leans as much into Neuromancer imagery as
Shadowrun’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacker characters are called Netrunners, and they use devices called cyberdecks
that range from the size of a desktop workstation to the size of a paperback
book, with a lot of plugs for neural interfaces and data lines but no built-in
keyboard or monitor. Decks all have the same starting stats, but smaller and
more portable models are more expensive. The most expensive deck is the only one
that has a built-in cellular modem. All the others need to jack into landlines
or directly into target devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most expensive decks are cheaper than a subcompact car, and they get much
more affordable if you give up that cellular modem. However netrunners are still
a specialized niche because Cyberpunk 2020 is a class-based system. Netrunner is
a specific class (or “Role”), and only they get the Interface skill that’s used
for hacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Shadowrun’s Matrix uses mainframes as the “backing” for its sci-fi chrome
flash, behind CP 2020’s flash is yet more flash with a dash of space magic. The
overall Net still works kinda like a phone grid, but the book works very hard to
make the reader see it as, effectively, a parallel dimension. Back in 2014 some
researchers effectively cast a spell over the telecom grid and turned it into a
“conceptual space” where each phone line and connected device is located in a
point analogous to its physical location. When you connect to the Net you form
an “ICON” (all caps) representing yourself at the point of entry, and accessing
other servers means making that ICON actually travel the distance between its
entry point and the destination. If you’re in Night City and your destination is
in Japan, there’s no way to reach it except hopping into a Long Distance Link
and flying over the entire Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are serious musings about how the “empty space” you fly over while
traversing these links is teeming with unindentified greeblies because every
computer is on the Net by simply being turned on. If it doesn’t have a
connection, it’s still on the Net, it’s just unreachable from the telecom
grid. Adding new connected systems “physically increases” the size of the Net,
and you could extend it to space by launching a server in a spaceship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of talk about local and regional telecom grids, much like in
Shadowrun, and a big emphasis on paying your phone bill for your home landline
or cellular modem, because CP 2020 never loses an opportunity to joke about
militarized debt collection squads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reasons to run the Net are to provide support to a physical team, and
to recover data from a target server. We can surprisingly already see the image
of the netrunner who stays together with their team here and hacks a series of
remotely controlled devices, doing stuff like controlling robot cars or opening
doors without having to do a full run. However only some PCs will be able to do
this out of the gate, since they might not have the cash for that cellular
portable deck. Oh, and this is an 80s cell, so moving too fast will break your
link. No 5G for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who can, there’s a series of control programs designed for different
types of device. Anything that can be described as “computer controlled” can be
hacked this way if the PC has the appropriate program, since due to SPACE MAGIC,
everything computerized is automatically in the Net. There are also programs for
remaining hidden, getting past barriers, and attacking both other programs and
other people. Everyone is going to want these even if they’re using a desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The netrunner’s Interface class skill is required to run the Net at all, but is
not used for all netrunning tasks. Its main use is in combat against security
programs (IC, “ice”) or other netrunners. Due to the way the character creation
system works it also determines your starting money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kind of server you expect a netrunner to hack is called a Data Fortress. It
vaguely resembles a mainframe, but as the name implies it goes all in on the VR
Dungeon aesthetic, even harder than Shadowrun did. You’re not moving through an
abstract representation of a mainframe, you’re crawling an actual dungeon-like
structure drawn on a 10x10 square grid. It has walls, gates, and security
programs acting like wandering monsters, and memory banks that work like
treasure chests. They have CPUs that act like brains, and give them an INT score
and possibly skills that are useful both in its day-to-day operations and when
fighting netrunners.  A Fortress with an INT of 12 or higher (which requires 4
CPUs) is a sapient AI and has a personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security programs are drawn from the same master list as netrunner
programs. You place them like monsters in the dungeon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly CP 2020 does not include sample characters, so we have to create
one. We’ll also need to create our target system, because the example there is a
bit too high level for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-netrunner-g0blin&quot;&gt;Our Netrunner: G0blin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So called because of his looks, he prefers to work from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/10/23/on-cyberpsychosis.html&quot;&gt;my Cyberware Capacity rules&lt;/a&gt; instead of Humanity, but that’s the only
tweak I did here. I lucked out on the starting stat and cash rolls and decided
to optimize my money by getting a desktop with expanded memory instead of a
portable deck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INT&lt;/strong&gt; 10 &lt;strong&gt;REF&lt;/strong&gt; 9 &lt;strong&gt;TECH&lt;/strong&gt; 7 &lt;strong&gt;LUCK&lt;/strong&gt; 6

   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Our target system
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following the rules in the CP2020 core book, and with a little help from its
random generation system, I came up with the Data Fortress depicted above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the key to the numbers and symbols in the file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1: Watchdog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2: Bloodhound&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3: Stun&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;4: Knockout&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;M*: Financial File, where the money is.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;M**: Grey Ops file, where the evidence is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Knockout was a originally a Hellhound, but I thought that might be a bit
excessive since the book keeps describing it as the scariest thing ever, only
employed by the richest and nastiest corporations. Still, there’s not much
difference for us, as one hit from the Knockout will still ensure a mission
failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;G0blin arrived from the left side of the screen. The Watchdog next to the gate
spotted him when he got close despite the running Stealth program. He destroyed
it with one attack, and then proceeded to crack the gate. Inside, he first went
right to the remotes and got spotted by another Watchdog. As before, he won
initiative and destroyed it with one attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he moved down, clipping through the CPU. He managed to stay hidden from
both the Bloodhound and the much more dangerous Stun, bushwhacking them with
sneak attacks. He examined the data stores there and drained the company’s
accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he went into the little corner room for the final leg of the mission. The
Knockout program didn’t spot him at first, but also didn’t go down with the
sneak attack. They went to initiative, G0blin won, and finished the program
off. This left him free to finish the mission, as both the door and evidence
were right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The run succeeded and took a total of around 21 game turns and 32 minutes of
real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-analysis-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Run Analysis and Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this less enjoyable than Shadowrun’s system, I guess, but it’s mostly
because of me. I’m not a big fan of how this game views the Net, or of how much
a net run resembles a roguelike dungeon crawl. Nevertheless it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do wonder if the quick runtime might have been because this host was too
easy. How would it have gone if I used the Militech regional office that comes
as an example as my system for this run? Or maybe I got something wrong when
designing the fortress or running the session?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume I got things right and the physical team takes the same amount of
time from the SR1 post to do their part (50 minutes for a perfectly stealthy run
or 90 for one with a firefight). This means the hacker takes up anywhere from a
third to half the session. That’s still more than the theoretic “ideal” ratio of
25%, but perhaps it could be alleviated with a bit of proper scene management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as VR dungeon crawls go, CP 2020’s are much more like brutal raids than
Shadowrun’s careful sneaking missions. Non-combat programs add only their
Strength to the d10 roll, while attacks and defenses use the netrunner’s INT and
Interface skill as well. Attacks are also much more devastating, since most
programs have a Strength of less than 6, and that 1d6 damage Killer programs do
reduces Strength directly. Even if the target survives, it’s greatly weakened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if any of those anti-personnel programs had managed to act
and hit our runner, they’d instantly be put out of commission and the mission
would fail. That’s another way in which it resembles a roguelike: the key to
victory is to bump the monster before the monster bumps you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several things that were unclear to me here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do detection rolls happen only once, or do they happen every turn? I went with
“every turn”, and this ended up making things more violent. Most ICE that
initially missed G0blin ended up spotting him on the second roll and forcing him
to enter combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you need control programs to operate those remote icons from a data fortress?
I went with “no” despite buying a couple of those for G0blin, because the
examples were all about netrunners controlling physical objects close to them
from meatspace. If I had went with “yes”, it would only have increased the
amount of turns the run took by a bit, since G0blin only tried to control these
remotes when all neighboring ICE had been killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also didn’t know what happened when a Watchdog spotted G0blin. Text said it
“alerts its owner”, but does that happen immediately or does the dog have to run
to where the owner is? I judged the program had to travel to the owner since the
setting places so much emphasis on the “physicality” of the Net. That would be
the terminal icon here in our map, but no dog ever made it there. If any had, we
might have seen an enemy netrunner here and the run would have perhaps been
harder.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackaton: Shadowrun 1st Edition Play Phase</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/sr1-cover.jpg&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Our target system
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/10/26/hackaton-sr1-1.html&quot;&gt;deciding on the design parameters&lt;/a&gt; for our Shadowrun 1st Edition
Matrix run, I got my stopwatch and jumped right into it. I stopped it at the end
of every node to keep a running tally of the elapsed time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the system map we’re using, for reference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/hackaton-sr1-system.png&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Our target system
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the account of events. As I mentioned before, the actual timed run was
written in a brief shorthand and the account below was expanded for readability
after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-1-san-red-3-trace-and-dump-4&quot;&gt;Node 1 (SAN): Red-3, Trace and Dump-4.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Decker enters through Node 1, dialing the mainframe’s modem. Security here
is unusually tight for a Shadowrun system - the target really doesn’t want
anyone sticking their noses in his business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t quite understood the rules here yet, thinking that you couldn’t use
your Hacking Pool outside of cybercombat for anything but improvising programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our decker arrives here at Sensor range, improvises Analyze-7 with her pool,
and runs that against the ICE, seeing that it’s a potentially dangerous
tracer. She moves into Contact range and I roll Initiative even though we’re not
in combat, just to have a sense of the flow of the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She runs Sleaze against the Tracer using only the program rating, beating the
ice but failing anyway because this is a Red node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that point on I learn that you can use Hacking Pool dice on any Computer or
program test even outside of combat, so I use some on the second attempt and
pass even though that has increased difficulty. Ice supressed, we get to whisper
“I’m in” into our comms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is where I realize there’s very little reason to be sparing with those
pool dice, and that I can use pool dice even for tests with improvised
programs. So my strategy for pretty much the rest of the run is to shout I AM
SPEED and drop my entire Hacking Pool on any test that doesn’t happen during
actual cybercombat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed so far: 1 turn, 13 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-2-spu-orange-5-access-6&quot;&gt;Node 2 (SPU): Orange-5, Access-6&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another beefy node, and our actual password prompt. Our Decker analyzes the Ice
like before, and this fails with a tie. I rule a tie doesn’t activate the
ICE. She decides not to try again and just tries Sleaze instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I AM SPEED gets us through this just fine - Sleaze works against everything, but
Deception would have worked here too. We can see two other nodes from this one,
but not what they are. I decide to flip a coin to see where we go next, and we
go right towards Node 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed so far: 2 turns, 28 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-3-spu-green-4-barrier-3&quot;&gt;Node 3: SPU, Green-4, Barrier-3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I arrive at my final interpretation for improvised
programs. Improvising them is part of the same action in which you run them, so
while this takes only 1 action total, the pool dice you use for the script
aren’t available for the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily Analyze’s rating doesn’t actually limit what it can discover, so we’re
better off improvising an Analyze-1 script and chucking our remaining 13 pool
dice into the test than going for Analyze-7 with 1 extra die. Having an actual
Analyze program would be even better, but this is pretty good still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our reckless Decker successfully analyzes the ICE and Sleazes past it using
the same actions and approach as before. I AM SPEED wins again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She sees there are two connected nodes, and it’s right here that I realize she’s
not actually in any danger at Sensor range and can back out after
reconnoitering. So Ms. Decker moves into Sensor range of the two connected nodes
in order to scout them all and see they’re an I/O Port and a Control node
without any ICE in them. She then decides to move on to Node 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed: 5 turns, 41 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-4-io-port-green-4&quot;&gt;Node 4: I/O Port, Green-4.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This node and Node 5 don’t actually have a security rating of their own, so I
gave them the same rating as the SPU that was linked to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We once again go with I AM SPEED, and our total of 21 dice easily takes care of
the system operation needed to disable the camera. Per the rules, after either
succeeding at a system operation or giving up after a number of failures, we
need to roll a d6. If the result is less than or equal to the number of
attempts, the system noticed something wrong and triggered an alert. We only had
one attempt before succeeding, and we roll a 3, so no alert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camera is off. First goal accomplished!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed: 6 turns, 47 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-5-control-green-4&quot;&gt;Node 5: Control, Green-4.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same deal as before, and same outcome. Alarm is off, second goal
accomplished. And we took less time because I already knew what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed: 7 turns, 50 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-6-spu-red-4-killer-4&quot;&gt;Node 6: SPU, Red-4, Killer-4.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have data to steal, so we go to the only unexplored path so far and try
to find data stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After scouting the node, we follow your usual procedure of Improvised Analyze -&amp;gt;
close to Contact range -&amp;gt; Initiative -&amp;gt; Sleaze, always using our whole Hacking
Pool for each individual test. We suppress the ICE without issue. If you noticed
how reckless we’re being, take a cookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further scouting reviews two data stores attached to this node. I flip another
coin to decide where to go, and we go down to Node 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed: 10 turns, 58 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-8-data-store-red-4-black-ice-5&quot;&gt;Node 8: Data Store, Red-4, Black Ice-5.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our usual Improvised Analyze routine shows us this data store is protected by
Black Ice! This is scary, but is also a very promising lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disregarding the danger, our Decker goes all in and chucks her whole Hacking
Pool into Sleaze again. She succeeds by exactly the needed amount and suppresses
the ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then uses Browse to find any drainable accounts, because she doesn’t know
the full layout of the system like we do. The operation succeeds but she doesn’t
find anything. Boo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remembering the actual mission, she Browses for incriminating evidence and finds
it. She has enough disk space for the file, and no time pressure for the
download, so we just wait a couple more turns. Third objective accomplished!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She still wants to find that money, though, so she moves to the other data store
at Node 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed: 13 turns, 1 hour, 9 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-7-data-store-red-4-access-5&quot;&gt;Node 7: Data Store, Red-4, Access-5&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same deal as usual. Improv Analyze reveals the ICE, Sleaze gets past it, Browse
confirms there’s nothing of value to the team in this node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is where I begin to notice that despite the different types of nodes and
the flowery descriptions of virtual dungeons, we’ve been performing more or less
the same sequence of tests in the same order, in a loop. So I guess a long
enough Matrix run might seem a bit boring for the decker as well. I’m still
having fun &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, because lucky rolls have given me a string of successes, but
I don’t feel like I’m in danger or having to make complex decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the only unexplored node left is the CPU. A cautious decker might decide
to cut their losses, perform the single remaining system operation they need,
and jack out. But we’ve already established our Decker is not cautious, SHE IS
SPEED!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total elapsed time: 14 turns, 1 hour, 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;node-9-cpu-red-5-trace-and-burn-6-black-ice-4&quot;&gt;Node 9: CPU, Red-5, Trace and Burn-6, Black Ice-4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setup is a little unusual here. This CPU has all the standard system
operations available, and the Trace and Burn-6 is protecting those. It also has
a link to the target’s bank account, and draining it counts as a custom system
operation. There’s a piece of Black Ice protecting that operation only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our Decker will have the run of the system if she neutralizes the Tracer, but
to get the money she must also get past the Black Ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She comes within Sensor Range, Improv-Analyzes both pieces of Ice, and sees what
they’re protecting. She decides to deal with the Tracer first. I roll Initiative
for everyone as she gets into Contact Range, but the ICE will only act if it
activates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the usual I AM SPEED approach giving us 19 dice to Sleaze past the
Tracer, the node’s high security level prevents us from succeeding. We try again
with increased difficulty, and this time a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unlucky roll gives the ice
more successes, meaning it activates!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing Trace and Burn does upon activation is try to raise an Internal
Alert in the system. This causes the ratings of all ICE to increase by 50%, so
we’re actually dealing with Trace-and-Burn 9 now. The Black Ice also improves to
Rating 6, but it remains inactive since it’s only protecting the bank account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could have allocated dice from our Hacking Pool to an opposed test to “jam”
the ice and prevent the alert from going through… but we already used all of
them on the Sleaze attempt, and the pool hasn’t refreshed yet. This is why our
Decker has been very reckless so far, as every piece of ice she faced until now
could have done this on a failed test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its first actual action, Trace and Burn rolls its rating to determine how
long it will take to trace the Decker. We’re lucky here because this roll gets
only 1 success, meaning it will take a total of 10 of the IC’s actions to do
so. Once that time is up, though, her deck is toast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Decker switches to using the Attack program to destroy the Tracer before
that happens. This is proper cybercombat, which works a little differently. The
“to-hit” roll is an unopposed test with only with your Hacking Pool against the
Node’s security. The program’s rating is your base damage if you hit, and it
increases by 1 for every extra success past the minimum required to hit. Actual
damage is your net successes in an opposed test of the ICE’s rating versus your
damage pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I end up using my entire pool in the to-hit roll, since any less than that means
I won’t be beating the difficulty on average. It takes me 3 turns to destroy the
Tracer this way, but since everyone acts multiple times per turn I only had 3
actions left before the trace completed. This was still somewhat repetitive
since it was the same set of rolls every time, but it was also exciting since
this is the first time our Decker is in any actual danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the tracer gone, she uses a system operation to cancel the alert and
manages to Sleaze past the Black Ice and drain the target’s account. Bonus
objective completed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that done, she moves normally to the Control Modules and opens the final
door, completing the mission’s objective. She then jacks out. Mission Complete!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total time elapsed: 19 turns, 2 hours and 4 minutes. This combat alone took 41
minutes to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-analysis-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Run Analysis and Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not gonna lie, I kinda feel like I completed an important life goal. I could
never understand this hacking system when I was 12, but now not only did I grok
it, I finished an entire Matrix run while using it. So I’m pretty happy, and I
had fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I must also conclude that all the criticisms leveled at this system are
valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the intro, we’re assuming our physical team has an easy time
getting past the reception area. This would take some light roleplaying and a
roll or two from our talker. That plus walking to the restricted area might take
10 minutes of real time, but it takes the decker 50 minutes to complete the
goals that let them move forward from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part of the physical mission will involve more tests and die rolls from
the physical team. The Decker takes around half an hour of real time to find the
electronic evidence, and it might be accurate to assume the physical team takes
about the same or a little bit longer to sneak past the guards and find the
physical documents. Let’s say 40 minutes for the physical team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the Decker decides to loot the server, and that takes 41 minutes. Unless
the physical team is having an epic shootout at the same time as they try to
leave the building, all they have to do is sit and wait. Otherwise they take
maybe 10 minutes total to reach the back door and walk out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a team that has a firefight on the way out might take up 90 minutes of real
time, and a team that doesn’t will take perhaps 50 with their part of the
mission. Our Decker is taking up &lt;em&gt;at best&lt;/em&gt; over half and at worst over
two-thirds of the session with her solo VR dungeon crawl. And this is all
assuming a 100% buttery smooth session with absolutely no digressions,
distractions, or rule arguments to make it longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a point where I kinda felt that the decking run itself was
getting a little repetitive, because the “optimal” procedure to follow became
obvious: Improv Analyze -&amp;gt; Sleaze, always dumping the entire Hacking Pool into
each test. In actual cybercombat, I also ended up doing the same thing over and
over until the enemy died. It was still enjoyable, but I could see it eventually
overstaying its welcome even for the decker player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if it turns out that my rules interpretations were overly generous and
this was supposed to be way harder, then all the criticisms I made become even
stronger, because everything would take more time and more rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackathon: Shadowrun 1st Edition Design Phase</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/sr1-cover.jpg&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Our target system
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this run we’ll be using the original edition of Shadowrun, published
in 1989. I started with second edition, but that’s not a problem because I’m
equally unfamiliar with both edition’s hacking systems!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing and setting and even the rules of these two early editions give me a
sort of cozy nostalgic feeling when I read them, but these days I am well aware
of all their issues, mechanical and otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting’s global network is called the Matrix. Hackers are called Deckers
because they use &lt;em&gt;cyberdecks&lt;/em&gt;, devices the about the size of a full 104-key
keyboard that have cable jacks for connecting directly to the decker’s neural
interface and to either a computer terminal or a communications line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a cyberdeck to access the Matrix takes you to the full Gibsonian VR
Dungeon experience, where you zip through the infinite grid of the Matrix and
then crawl through the low-poly simulated environments of a server, treating its
security programs as monsters and its data as loot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beneath the chrome flash, we’re dealing with classic mainframes from the
Eighties. The Matrix isn’t the Internet, it’s the global phone grid. You access
your target mainframe by connecting to the phone grid yourself and dialing the
number of the mainframe’s modem. There are even rules for making long-distance
and international calls. Mainframe numbers are usually unlisted, but can be
found with diligent research by deckers or provided by whoever’s hiring them for
the run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cyberdeck is distinctly different from a mere “computer”, crammed full of
specialized electronics that allow it to be used for operating in VR and hacking
mainframes. Personal computers don’t do really do much other than letting you
store and view data files, and perhaps acting as dumb terminals to mainframes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberdecks cost a fortune! The one used by the sample starting characters in the
book costs more than a sports car. The most expensive one is about twice the
price of a fighter jet. And that’s just for the base hardware. If you want your
deck to be truly tubular, you’re probably going to spend around twice its base
price on software and optional extras. Deckers tend to be highly specialized at
character creation because they need to spend most of their points on money and
most of their money on a deck - there isn’t any “room” to be anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mainframe is composed of a set of Nodes representing its different parts,
connected by Data Lines. The end result is a lot like a dungeon with rooms and
corridors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each node allows users to perform a different set of System Operations related
to its function. Authorized users can do this automatically. Our decker must
perform a Computer skill test to beat the node’s Security Rating, a color and
number combination that gives you both the difficulty of the roll and how many
successes you need. If you fail at performing a system operation, you might
trigger an alert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deckers can also run Utility Programs, which do things not listed in the system
operations menu. There are four program categories, and each has a slightly
different procedure that’s some variation of rolling the program rating against
the node’s security. Some programs degrade, losing effectiveness each time
they’re used. This resets when the decker jacks out. Failing at using a program
doesn’t raise an alert, but might trigger IC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is very concerned about how large programs are because there are rules
for loading them from disk to RAM and managing your free memory. Not having
enough RAM to run all you need at once is the quintessential 80s computing
experience after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All Computer skill tests and Utility Programs can benefit from the decker’s
Hacking Pool, which is equal to the sum of their Computer Skill and Reaction
attribute, modified by stuff that increases Reaction. Like other dice pools in
this system, it refreshes at the start of every action. You can allocate dice
from it to benefit any Computer or Program tests while in the Matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use a program you don’t have, you can improvise a single-use
script version of it with your Hacking Pool. You can only improvise a degrading
program once per Matrix run, but if I understand the book correctly you can
improvise non-degrading programs multiple times. I’m interpreting the rules to
mean that an improvised program must be used in the same action, otherwise there
would be little reason to buy any programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most nodes are going to have some IC (Intrusion Countermeasures, “ice”) in
them. The mere presence of IC stops deckers from performing system operations or
moving past the node, and they must either destroy or fool the IC before they
can do these things. Most ice only triggers when it beats you in the opposed
test to fool it. If you beat it but fail to beat the node’s base security, they
remain inactive and still block your progress. Subsequent attempts are harder,
increasing your chances of triggering the ice. Attacking IC directly also
triggers it, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White ice is completely passive. It tries to raise an alarm but you can block it
with your Hacking Pool. Grey ice additionally tries to trace you or attack your
deck. Black Ice attacks the &lt;em&gt;decker&lt;/em&gt; directly, and might kill them. There’s a
little bestiary of different types within each category.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matrix turns happen at the same speed as physical combat turns, using the same
initiative rules. Both types of turn last around 3 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Shadowrun 1st Edition version of our run, our decker is going to be
remote, and we will assume the team discovered the mainframe’s unlisted phone
number during their prep phase. I’m going to take a couple of shortcuts here
because those are available to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our decker, we’ll be using the &lt;strong&gt;Decker Archetype&lt;/strong&gt; from the SR1
corebook. She has Computer 6, the Fuchi-4 deck with a decent spread of mods and
programs, and a hacking pool of 15. I’m going to cheat a little bit and replace
her Deception 4 utility with Sleaze 4, because from what I understood of the
system there is no reason to ever take Deception when you can take Sleaze
instead. Let’s assume she has one run under her belt and used the payout from
that to upgrade her software a bit. Even with Sleaze’s larger size she can still
fit all her programs in RAM at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Our target system
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our target system, we’ll be using the one from page 55 of the &lt;strong&gt;Mercurial&lt;/strong&gt;
adventure. Here’s a list of the ICE present in the system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node 1: Trace and Dump-4.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node 2 Access-6.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node 3: Barrier-3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node 4: no ICE.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node 5: no ICE.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node 6: Killer-4.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node 7: Access-5&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node 8: Black Ice-5.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Node 9: Trace and Burn-6, Black Ice-4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node 4 will be connected to our security camera, Node 5 to the alarm and
door. Node 8 will contain the evidence we seek, and the CPU at Node 9 is where
we can drain their accounts because that’s how it is in the original
adventure. The other data store at Node 7 has nothing of value to our runners.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackathon, part 00: Introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/hackers-cast.jpg&quot;
       alt=&quot;The protagonists of the 1995 movie Hackers.&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Getting ready to hack the Gibson.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently got into a forum discussion about hacking in cyberpunk tabletop RPGs,
as one does. This one was mostly centered around Shadowrun, and it touched on a
lot of the reasons why one might want to &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/10/08/hacking-without-hackers.html&quot;&gt;play without a hacker PC&lt;/a&gt; even when
you want to feature hacking in your game. It also got a bit into edition
arguments, as it often does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadowrun’s problems are more or less universal to the genre, as mentioned in
the other post linked above. The first three editions go heavy into the whole
Gibsonian VR Dungeon aesthetic and suffer from the classic problems from that
approach. It’s also very inspired by how 80s mainframes worked, and rules aside
it all made so much more sense to me once I realized that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth has something that visually resembles Ghost in the Shell or Cyberpunk
2077, where the hacker follows along with the group and hacks a series of
smaller devices using an augmented reality interface. My recollection is that
this is supposed to be faster, but the discussion in question had people
complaining it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyberpunk-the-game is similar, with CP 2020 going in fully for VR dungeons, and
CP RED going in for smaller localized servers that are also supposed to only
take a small series of rolls to solve instead of an hours-long minigame. They’re
are much less inspired by reality than Shadowrun’s (though this is of course not
a knock on them, merely an observation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also more recent games that try to either capture the nostalgic feel
of old-school cyberpunk or to express the same themes in a more modern way. I’m
thinking of Neon City Overdrive and Hard Wired Island, respectively. I’m not
very familiar with them yet but I intend to change that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you have GURPS, which has a few hacking systems of its own depending on
which genre you’re talking about. The ones I’m interested in are the one from
Pyramid #3/21, which emulates classic cyberdecks-and-mainframes hacking but
could also work for GitS-style shenanigans, and the more streamlined one from
GURPS Action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I kinda want to see if they all match the memories and impressions I have of
them. Let’s try them all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hackathon-scenario-and-rules&quot;&gt;Hackathon Scenario and Rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture a team of flawed but stylish urban mercenaries composed of a hacker, a
sneaky talker, and a pair of sneaky bruisers. They’re on a mission to take down
a corrupt and racist businessman, and they learned a company he owns stores the
sort of evidence that can’t be ignored by the government: proof of rampant
embezzling and tax evasion, in both digital and hardcopy forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mercenaries are going to infiltrate a small, single-office company, one of
the many owned by the target. It does do legitimate business but also serves as
a “stash” for records about the target’s illegal activities. Secret ledgers,
blackmail material, and so on. Some of this lives in the company’s computer
system, some of it is stored in hardcopy in a “records room” whose access is
restricted to normal employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employees and other authorized personnel can wander the legitimate business area
of the office freely, but the “records room” can only be accessed by a small
group of people who work directly for the target and drop by occasionally to use
it. There’s a back entrance with an electronic lock so that these lieutenants
can get in and out outside of business hours and/or without bringing too much
employee attention to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The records room is watched by a camera and protected by an alarm that triggers
if a stranger or even a normal employee tries to get close to it. There’s a
small guard shift here during the day which increases at night. The guards know
who the lieutenants are, and their duties involve keeping everyone else away
from the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The office’s computer system will be different in every game. In all of them
it’s supposed to be small but with tighter than expected security, because of
what it hides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team’s mission is to infiltrate this office, steal all the evidence, and if
possible drain the company’s accounts on the way out, because at the end of the
day ya still gotta eat, chummer. Here’s how things are supposed to go, with a
greater focus on the hacker’s part since this is what I’m interested in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the team enters the building disguised as a maintenance crew. We’ll
assume this part succeeds, giving them limited freedom of movement inside the
office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next they must enter the records room. For them to be able to do this, the
hacker must turn off a security camera and an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the previous step succeeds, the hacker must locate and steal the target data
from the office’s computer system. Technically, the best strategy would be to
steal the evidence first and only then drain the accounts, but our hacker will
do things in the order in which they run into the corresponding locations. The
lure of money is strong when the account is right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the hacker must unlock the back door so the team can leave. Ideally
they will do so quietly and with no one the wiser, but this could happen in the
middle of a firefight. Possibly one caused by the hacker triggering an alert in
the computer system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each of the following systems, I’m going to stat up a hacker character and a
computer system that conforms to that game’s paradigm and rules. And then I’ll
roll through the target session while timing how long it takes me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shadowrun 1st Edition&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyberpunk 2020&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shadowrun 4th Edition, 20th Anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cyberpunk RED&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shadowrun 5th Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neon City Overdrive&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hard Wired Island&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GURPS Action with the Pyramid #3/21 system, both in “classic” and “modern”
modes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;GURPS Action with its own system. Not sure this can accommodate the scenario,
but we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m using this particular list because those are the books I happen to own at
present. I’m not sure if I want to spend money to acquire the hacking systems
used in Shadowrun 2nd and 3rd Edition, though I do remember they are notably
different from SR1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hacker and their equipment will be at roughly starting character level for
each game, possibly with a slight tweak or two, and the challenges faced should
be challenging but not impossible for the hacker. Whether the target devices are
separate or part of the same single “target system”, and whether the hacker is
even with the physical team, will depend on the system in question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have more practical experience with some of these systems than with others,
but I will be studying all of them to ensure I do each run “right”. Preliminary
study doesn’t count towards the timed session, but consultations that happen
during the actual run &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, because I’ve never been in a session where people
didn’t have to consult the books for something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be writing a lot of stuff down during the actual run, but I’ll try to be as
brief as possible there. It’s still going to take a bit more time than doing it
verbally, but I think it evens out because there will be no table talk or extra
player questions getting in the way. I’ll write wordier summaries after the run
is done, and these are the ones that will see publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All rolls will be made on Orokos, but I’m not going to save them and will just
report the results in the article.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Coiled Spring</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/coiled-spring.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  Image source: &lt;a
  href=&quot;https://www.deviantart.com/eveyd/art/Antique-Vintage-Pocket-Watch-png-268108244&quot;&gt;EveyD
  on DeviantArt&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coiled Spring is an amulet made of brass. It’s disc shaped and about an inch
thick. On its front, there is a relief of a snake eating its own tail, the
classic Ouroboros. The inside of the ring formed by the snake is a clear crystal
panel, through which can be seen a spring like that of a watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That spring can store up to ten Fatigue Points which can be used to enable
bursts of extra effort - most often &lt;em&gt;Extra Effort in Combat&lt;/em&gt; (p. B357), but also
other athletic feats. The stored FP can only be used for those purposes, and is
not affected by negative effects that would sap the user’s own FP. In other
words, it works just like the Heroic Reserves advantage from &lt;strong&gt;GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy 20: Slayers&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; like a power item for martial characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between the Coiled Spring and a normal Power Item is that it
hijacks the natural recovery processes of the wearer’s body in order to “wind”
itself, and cannot be recharged by the usual methods for power items. While the
Spring is not at full capacity, its wearer is unable to recover their own
Fatigue Points, and the amulet gains 1 FP every 10 minutes. This is a constant
rate - traits which speed up FP recovery for the wearer have no effect on the
amulet. The wearer regains their usual ability to rest when the amulet is fully
charged, or when it’s removed (which stops the charging process).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this does mean recharging the Coiled Spring in town is effectively free,
it can make dungeon delving more complicated for martial characters,
particularly if the GM enforces rules like fatigue costs for fighting a battle
(p. B426 or DF Exploits p. 60). Characters who normally can’t use Fatigue Points
can wear the Coiled Spring and use it to benefit from the Extra Effort rules in
and out of combat, though they can’t recharge it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholars who know of the Spring speculate that it was originally meant  to allow
golems and other constructs to surpass their limits. In an adventure, it will
most likely be found worn by such a construct, or by an elite warrior who
figured out it works just as well for organics. If found in a chest or hoard,
though, it will always start out empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the delvers try to sell the Coiled Spring, or if you decide it’s available in
shops, its monetary value is twice that of a Power Item of the same
capacity. That’s $3400 for the 10 FP version described here, though you could
have versions with greater or smaller capacity. Note that you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; double-dip
and use the Coiled Spring as a Power Item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variant Springs are possible. Maybe the Flywheel of Faith can power divine
magic, the Arcane Array wizardly spells, and the Goddess Gyre druidic ones. The
recharging mechanics and all other restrictions are the same. They could allow a
construct who can’t normally cast spells or use casting magical items due to a
lack of FP to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hacking Without a Hacker</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/lancer-horus.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    NPC hackers waiting for the PCs to arrive at the jackpoint.

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether called a hacker, a decker, or a netrunner, the person who invades
computer systems and makes them do things features prominently in the stories
most cyberpunk RPGs take inspiration from, and so often ends up being a vitally
important archetype in those games. However, they tend to have a very mixed
track record when it comes to actually presenting you with a hacking system
that’s fun and bug-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means there are many possible reasons for why you might find yourself
planning a cyberpunk game but have no cause or wish to use its hacking
rules. Maybe none of the players wants to be a hacker, or maybe the group just
doesn’t like the rules of the game in question. In those cases, a popular
suggestion is to include a NPC hacker, and in this post we’ll discuss a way to
do so that keeps the rest of the group reasonably involved in the hacking. Rules
are for GURPS, but the concepts can be easily translated to other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-from-home&quot;&gt;Work From Home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current best practice in games that include hacker PCs is to devise ways to
keep the hacker together with the rest of the party, so that they can fully
participate in the game even when it’s not hacking time. When your group’s
hacker is an NPC, however, the best thing to do is the opposite. Hacker NPCs
should always do their thing remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing NPCs who constantly accompany the party is a tricky affair. A character
who’s much weaker than the party runs the risk of turning the adventure into a
video-game-style escort quest, one of the most reviled types of mission in
existence. One who is strong enough to protect themselves can end up becoming a
GMPC, a label reserved for annoying characters who overshadow the players and
make them feel like the support cast of someone else’s story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is subjective, which makes it even trickier. Your group’s fun will
be hurt if they &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; either of those scenarios is happening, even if the math
is well-balanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A remote hacker removes most of the risk. They’re in communication with the
group, and they can do the jobs covered by their niche, but any other challenge
that can be handled by the PC’s own skills &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be, even if it’s
technological in nature. And there are things the hacker can only do with
on-site support from the PCs, which keeps them involved in the actual hack even
if you’re not engaging with those rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exact nature of these support tasks depends on how your specific setting
handles computers and hacking. Most games either go the same Retro way of early
Shadowrun and CP2020, or a more “Modern” way that uses more recent tropes such
as the ones employed by Shadowrun 4th Edition or CP2077. We’ll look at how you
can accommodate a remote NPC hacker in both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-of-another-timeline&quot;&gt;The Future of Another Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not immediately obvious to us here in 2023, but the earliest iterations of
Shadowrun’s Matrix and CP2020’s NET were based on a pre-Internet model of
networked computing. Strip all the futuristic terms from their description and
you’ll find out you’re dealing with 80s mainframes. This lies at the root of a
lot of things there that can look a bit weird or silly to modern
readers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Here’s a short and approximately correct explanation for how that
works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainframes are huge (and hugely expensive) computers that are usually
responsible for handling all data processing for an entire company or
organization. They were the dominant form of institutional computing from around
the 1950s to at least the early 1990s, and never really went away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mainframe is operated through remote terminals, which can be in the same
building or even off-site. Therefore, it must be ready to receive connections
and requests from these terminals. And the way you do that in the 80s is through
phone lines and modems. They do have &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; security measures to
authenticate users and prevent one user from seeing or changing other users’
data, but there is no such thing as a firewall because permanent Internet
connections are not yet a thing for mainframes. The most security you can add to
the connection step is to keep the numbers for your mainframe’s phone lines
unlisted&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is why both Shadowrun’s and CP2020’s descriptions of their “global
nets” are so concerned about splitting them into geographical regions and
assigning codes to them and the servers within them. That net is not the
&lt;em&gt;Internet&lt;/em&gt;, but a world-spanning phone circuit. The first step to hacking
into that corporate mainframe is to dial the unlisted number of its modem&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;old-school-remote-hacking&quot;&gt;Old-School Remote Hacking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a PC hacker in these more “retro” games, the number of the
target’s modem line might be included with the mission briefing, letting them
hack removely. It’s more likely that no number is included, then the hacker has
to go in with the group and find an terminal in the target facility through
which they could connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a hacker NPC and they have the number, the reason the adventure is
happening at all is because the mission objectives have a physical component
that must happen at the same time. The typical setup is that you need to steal
the physical prototype while the hacker grabs the research files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they don’t have the number, then &lt;em&gt;discovering&lt;/em&gt; the number becomes one of the
physical mission objectives! The place the PCs are infiltrating might not even
have any direct relation to the real, final objective, but it could be a place
that also uses the same mainframe remotely. The number is going to be written
down somewhere in there, either in an official manual, some employee’s personal
notes or even a scrap of paper that was carelessly thrown away&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Some
non-VR-dungeon hacking of a physical terminal to peek at its configuration might
be necessary, which might be resolved by a couple of rolls since dumb terminals
are less secure than the mainframe they talk to. Or you might need to find a way
to scam the info out of an someone who works there (“social engineering”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fact-finding expedition could be a whole adventure in itself, or it might
just be an intermediate step in a more complex operation where the group must
also infiltrate the final target facility at the same time as the hacker does
their thing, as outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;twenty-minutes-from-now&quot;&gt;Twenty Minutes From Now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recent cyberpunk games tend to base their networks on the real-world
Internet and the technologies that support it. This means that every individual
device attached to a network is effectively a full-feature computer, be it an
employee’s workstation, a security camera, or a guard’s smartphone. Different
departments have their own private servers and their own internal network that
doesn’t necessarily connect to the others or to the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less sensitive facilities might allow employees to work remotely from their
homes or from other buildings by letting them connect via &lt;em&gt;virtual private
networks&lt;/em&gt;. These connections to happen over the Internet, but they’re encrypted
and protected from general snooping. Realistically, our dastardly hacker would
need to steal valid credentials to be able to access a VPN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other extreme, a top-secret secure facility might be &lt;em&gt;air-gapped&lt;/em&gt;, which
means it’s isolated and sealed in such a way that no signal can enter or leave
the building. None of its internal networks are connected to the outside world,
and they are not connected to each other either unless this is absolutely
necessary. The servers controlling the security system are isolated from the
servers housing sensitive data. Each has its own independent set of protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is both realistic according to our contemporary understanding of network
security, and an excellent way to make sure PC hackers stick with the group and
have plenty to do once inside. Individual hacking attempts tend to be shorter
but more numerous, and made against devices that are within the hacker’s
immediate reach&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Shadowrun 4th Edition goes deep into this (5th and onwards
go back to the retro model), and it’s also more or less how things work in
Cyberpunk 2077.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-school-remote-hacking&quot;&gt;New-School Remote Hacking&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an environment so full of incentives for the hacker to stick with the party,
how can you accommodate a remote NPC hacker?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the target facility has a VPN that contains the data you want, then many of
the same “classic” techniques for acquiring those old-school mainframe phone
numbers might also work to acquire valid VPN credentials, allowing the NPC to
hack the place remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it doesn’t have a VPN or is completely isolated, then we need to resort to
quantum bullshit. Below we’ll see GURPS stats for the bullshit in question,
imported directly from Warframe. It’s easily usable in other systems, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/CorpusDatamass.webp&quot; width=200/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A datamass.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;datamass&lt;/strong&gt; is a device similar in concept to the causality communicator in
Ultra-Tech page 45, but &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; cheaper. It consists of an armored,
briefcase-sized device that incorporates several kinds of data cable plus laser
and IR micro-communicators and a small radio (GURPS Ultratech pages 43-44). All
of these are connected to a sizable amount of quantum-entangled matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datamasses are made in entangled pairs that allow high-bandwidth communication
and data transfer between elements of the pair through any amount of barriers or
interference. They have DR 10, HP 8, cost $5000 for the pair, weight 5kg (10 lb)
each, and are LC1 (AKA &lt;em&gt;super illegal&lt;/em&gt;). They also include an emergency
self-destruct switch that melts the internals of both elements of the pair and
can be triggered from either side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your typical cyberpunk setting, datamasses were first invented as
super-secret espionage tools by a major government or computer-focused megacorp,
and initially gave them a major leg up in one of the many ongoing cold wars
between such entities. The secret of their existence soon leaked, however, and
an enterprising independent engineer figured out they were quite easy to make
with a properly modified home 3d printer. Yes, even the entangled matter. The
plans for a home-baked datamasses were soon made widely available on the Net,
and they keep popping up no matter how much effort the corps spend to squash
them. That’s why they’re relatively cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datamass technology is going to be really revolutionary when FTL travel is
invented in the distant future, but for now it’s mostly used for its original
purpose, and allows teams of plucky street mercs like the PCs to operate at the
same level as crack corporate commandos when it comes to high-level
espionage. If the PCs are hired to do a hacking mission, they will usually be
provided a datamass pair. PCs can also buy their own through the usual illegal
channels available to PCs in these games. It should be difficult, but not
impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a setting that has datamasses, hacking missions look a lot like the Warframe
“mobile defense” missions these devices come from. The PCs need to sneak into
the target facility carrying a datamass, and find a place where to connect it. A
direct cable connection to a machine in the target network is best. A wi-fi
connection will do in a pinch, but will make everything that follows take
longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the hacker is an NPC, you don’t need to roll anything for the actual
hack - you just need to give the PCs a time frame for when it will be done. And
then they must stay near the datamass and guard it until that much time has
elapsed. If they snuck in, they need to find a way to maintain stealth and
divert security attention from their access point. If they’re found out, it
turns into a fight, but they still must stay until the hack is done or it will
fail. For added Fun(TM), a difficult mission might require the party to do this
several times from different access points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-destruct switch is useful for when the hack is done, as it allows the
party to leave without having to lug the datamass back out. It can also prevent
the hacker from being traced if the device is captured. Or it can be used in a
double-cross that leaves the team stranded in enemy territory without network
support. Use that last one sparingly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Alas, it’s not related to the whole VR Dungeon thing. That’s weird and
silly for other reasons. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The real-world practice of &lt;em&gt;wardialing&lt;/em&gt; consisted of dialing every number
in a big list or an entire area code looking for accessible modems. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And you can absolutely go wardialiing there. The Genesis version of
Shadowrun even implements it. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The real world hacking practice of &lt;em&gt;dumpster diving&lt;/em&gt; consists in searching
a company’s trash for discarded papers with valid passwords and credentials
written down on them. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Anywhere from “directly plugged in” to “in the same local wi-fi network”. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
