        <title>Dungeon Fantasy &quot;Monster&quot;: Recap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m going to write this in the same format I use for my Monster Manual Let’s
Reads, even though it’s not really a “monster”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These plump mushrooms are a about a foot tall when fully grown, and have purple
caps. They’re very distantly related to shriekers, but their abilities are much
more specialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone disturbs a recap, the mushroom scans the person’s memories and
loudly summarizes the most important events of the last week or so of their
lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Most important” here is defined by what’s foremost in the target’s minds. Yes,
they do have a tendency to spill closely held secrets that are big sources of
anxiety or regret for the victim. Some believe recaps they were originally
developed by an underground civilization with a strong tradition in psionics to
acts as interrogation tools. Nowadays you can find them in the wild inside caves
and other damp and dark places, like many dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least one investigator on the surface is known to carry a potted recap around
in a specially built cage, using it for its original purpose when questioning
suspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the victim manages to resist the mind reading attempt, the recap
will still speak a bunch of unconnected nonsense words for a minute or so. Those
who are mainly concerned about noise should refrain from touching them at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recaps aren’t “monsters” in a literal sense. Despite their radio-announcer
voices, they’re nonsapient and immobile. A good whack with any weapon will
destroy your typical recap. In GURPS, it has SM -5, DR 0, and 1 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wild-recap-cluster&quot;&gt;Wild Recap Cluster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wild, recaps grow in clusters and work like traps. Clusters are usually
on the ground, but might also grow on walls or ceilings. If one mushroom in the
cluster is disturbed by a touch at least strong enough to jostle it, the whole
cluster “activates” and performs its narration as one big speaker. Actual damage
also counts, of course - if a damaging attack leaves at least one recap
standing, it will activate on the next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recap cluster takes up 1 hex and has the following stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detect&lt;/em&gt;: Clusters are usually big enough to be plainly visible. Roll
&lt;strong&gt;Naturalist&lt;/strong&gt; at -2 to identify the mushrooms as recaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disarm&lt;/em&gt;: No. Attacks that deal at least 6 damage to the whole hex at once will
completely destroy all the recaps before they can activate. Anything less will
trigger them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avoid&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;DX&lt;/strong&gt; at -5 or &lt;strong&gt;Light Walk&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;Silence&lt;/strong&gt; spell will render the
cluster harmless for as long as it lasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Save&lt;/em&gt;: Quick Contest of &lt;strong&gt;Will&lt;/strong&gt; against skill 16 to avoid having your mind
read. &lt;strong&gt;Magic Resistance&lt;/strong&gt; helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Effect&lt;/em&gt;: About a minute of loud noises. If the target won the contest of Will,
this will be a string of nonsense words. If they lost, the recap will summarize
the previous week of their lives as if it was the last episode of a radio
serial, potentially airing some dirty laundry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shots&lt;/em&gt;: Constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rearm&lt;/em&gt;: No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steal&lt;/em&gt;: Roll against &lt;strong&gt;Naturalist&lt;/strong&gt; to harvest one large, healthy recap
specimen per hex. This weights 1 lb. and is worth $1000 if delivered intact to
the right people back in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recap-inquisitor&quot;&gt;Recap Inquisitor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consists of a large, healthy recap specimen planted on good soil in a clay
pot, surrounded by small but sturdy iron cage with large gaps between the
bars. It’s used by the “right people” back in town or by unscrupulous villains
in interrogations. They just need to ask (or force) the subject to poke the
mushroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject must win a quick contest of &lt;strong&gt;Will&lt;/strong&gt; against a skill of 16 to
prevent the ‘shroom from narrating all their dirty laundry from the past seven
days. It will speak a string of nonsense words if the subject resists, and
experienced handlers will know what that means. The cage offers DR 7 against
swinging attacks and other impacts (such as dropping the device), but the large
gaps mean it doesn’t protect against thrusting ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recap Inquisitors cost $2000 and weight 10 lbs. Monthly maintenance requires
$100 in supplies and success in a &lt;strong&gt;Naturalist&lt;/strong&gt; roll to keep the ‘shroom alive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Guns of Wolfenstein, Part 03: The New Order</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2025/08/04/guns-of-wolfenstein-02.html&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; of this series, we took a look at the guns that appear on
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, whose timeline I named “Wolfenstein-2” for ease of
reference. The timeline from the 2001 game, whose guns I talked about [here][2],
was Wolfenstein-1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we will take a look at the weapons that appear in Wolfenstein: The New
Order, a game that was published &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; The Old Blood (2014) but whose stories
starts right when The Old Blood ends. We’ll also make some mentions to the last
game in the trilogy, The New Colossus (from 2017) but the weapons that make
their debut in that game will be presented in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-new-order-plot-overview-contains-spoilers&quot;&gt;The New Order Plot Overview (Contains Spoilers)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though this game was launched a year earlier, its story starts off right after
The Old Blood ends, in 1946. After B. J. Blaskowicz returns to the Allies with
the location of General Deathshead’s secret hideout, they mount a massive attack
on that island fortress. This is a higher-budget version of the final chapters
of the 2001 game, which ended with Deathshead’s defeat, but things don’t that
well here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack is a disaster. Deathshead kills most of B.J.’s unit and leaves the
rest of them to die in a deathtrap. The survivors manage to escape just as the
room they’re in explodes, but the explosion buries a large piece of shrapnel in
Blazko’s brain. He washes ashore somewhere in Poland, catatonic, and since no
one knows who he is, gets sent to an asylum. He spends the next 14 years there
slowly recovering, with nearly no motor function, slipping in and out of comas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Nazi attack on the asylum in 1960 gives him the impulse he needs to complete
his recovery, and the first actual level of the game is escaping that situation
with a nurse named Anna, the other survivor of the place. They reach Anna’s
grandparents, where Blazko learns that the Nazis won the war in 1948, and that
as far as everyone knows the last members of the resistance had been captured
and sent to an “inescapable” prison in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the game is about freeing these prisoners, rebuilding the
resistance, and striking back at Deathshead through a series of daring
heists. These start with the rescue of good-guy super-scientist Seth Roth&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,
and proceed with the the capture of a giant enemy submarine, the recovery of its
nuclear launch codes from a Nazi base on the Moon, and finally an attack on
Deathshead’s fortress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blazko manages to kill Deathshead during the second attack on his fortress,
though the asshole manages to detonate a grenade as he dies. The game ends as
B. J., too wounded to evacuate, gives his allies the all-clear to launch the
nuke that will destroy this fortress for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-guns&quot;&gt;The Guns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the guns here are, again, captured Nazi hardware. And
those, in turn, are “new and improved” versions of the guns we saw in The Old
Blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their actual mechanics and list of available weapons changes a bit between this
game and its sequel in ways that can be better explained by changes in artistic
and gameplay direction than by in-setting developments. The weapons presented
here are based partially on a melding of their two versions, and partially on
what I’d think would be more interesting for a GURPS Action game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post focuses on the weapons that make their first appearance in The New
Order. The next one will present the ones that first appear in The New Colossus,
using the same adaptation strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m omitting price information as usual. In a Wolfenstein-inspired game, PCs
will be picking these up from the corpses of their enemies. In other games, the
GM can figure out a price based on the prices of similar real-world weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pistols&quot;&gt;Pistols&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pistol-model-1960&quot;&gt;Pistol Model 1960&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A direct descendant of the 1946 model, this one has a more futuristic look, a
double-stacked 20-round magazine, and the ability to fire 3-round bursts. It
still takes the same cinematic silencer. As before, it adds -1 to Bulk, makes
the gun cinematically silent, and also makes it only able to fire in semi-auto
mode (RoF 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If using standard GURPS skills, you need Guns (Pistol) to fire in semi-auto
mode, and Guns (SMG) to fire bursts. If using the optional skills from Pyramid
#3/65, you need Guns (Pistol), with the Burst-Fire technique for firing bursts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Pistol 1960&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2d+2 pi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;160/1800&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1.4kg/0.5kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;20+1(3)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-arms&quot;&gt;Long Arms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the standard system, use the Guns skill that corresponds to their description
(SMG, Shotgun, Rifle).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using the alternate skills from Pyramid #3/65, they all use Guns (Long
Arm), of course. The Burst-Fire technique helps fire weapons at a RoF greater
than 3 without penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;american-submachine-gun&quot;&gt;American Submachine Gun&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much a historical &lt;strong&gt;Thompson M1A1&lt;/strong&gt;, described in p. HT122. The
Allies mostly didn’t have access to superscience in this timeline and were
limited to historical equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied soldiers are armed with this during the 1946 assault on Deathshead’s
compound, and the game expects you to use them for the handful of minutes
between the start of gameplay and the moment when you first grab an enemy
weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assault-rifle-model-1960&quot;&gt;Assault Rifle Model 1960&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An evolution of the 1946 model, it’s lighter and uses a double-stacked 45 round
magazine, but still fires the same round. The biggest change here is an
underbarrel accessory rail that can take a mini-rocket launcher, which appears
as an upgrade midway through the game. This is detailed in the Launchers
section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;marksman-rifle-1960&quot;&gt;Marksman Rifle 1960&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This semi-automatic rifle is about the same length as the AR, but fires a
heftier round (likely 7.92x57mm) from a 10-round magazine. It has an integral
scope. It’s a relatively rare find both in the hands of enemies and as
loot. Clearly the Nazis are bigger fans of the spray-and-pray approach to
marksmanship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An extended 30-round magazine is available: Shots 30+1(3), Weight becomes
6.2kg/1.05kg. The gun can also fire APHC rounds: Dam 6d+2(2) pi-.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shockhammer-model-1960&quot;&gt;Shockhammer Model 1960&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another descendant of the gun from The Old Blood, this one uses a “snail drum”
magazine and a single barrel to achieve better performance than its
predecessor. The most commonly available shells for the weapon are standard
buckshot, and “shrapnel”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shrapnel shells fire red-hot fragments that ricochet off walls in a very
video-gamey way, allowing the player to hit enemies behind cover or around
corners by bouncing the shrapnel off the wall behind them. The shotgun can only
fire in semi-auto mode while using these shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the GURPS version below, I’m treating shrapnel as Multi-Flechette shells
(High-Tech p. 174) with an incendiary effect. Damage becomes 1d+1 pi- inc; Range
becomes 100/1200; RoF becomes 3x20. GMs who wish to replicate the ricochet
effect can reduce the penalty for firing at targets behind cover when there are
suitable surfaces nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the GM’s discretion, any special shells listed in High Tech and Ultra-Tech
might also be available for this shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;long-arms-table&quot;&gt;Long Arms Table&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;energy-weapons&quot;&gt;Energy Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a surprising amount of energy weapons in both games. All of these use
Beam Weapons (Rifle) unless noted otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laser weapons in this setting draw power from internal batteries that can’t be
removed without disassembling the weapon. The usual method of reloading them is
by using one of the highly dangerous industrial power outlets that seem to be
everywhere in Nazi-dominated cities and facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In The New Order, these use short-ranged wireless power transfer. In The New
Colossus, they use a thick cable with a plug that resembles a gas station
pump. I suggest picking an aesthethic and sticking to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wireless Charging&lt;/strong&gt;: The wielder must stay within 2 meters of the outlet
during the process, which causes lightning to arc between the outlet and the
weapon’s power receptors. Doing anything with the weapon other than holding it
steady will interrupt the recharge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wired Charging&lt;/strong&gt;: The wielder must plug the cable into the weapon (1 Ready
Action), and then stay within 1 meter of the outlet. The weapon cannot be used
while charging. Once charging is done, it takes another Ready maneuver to unplug
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recharge time is listed for each weapon, and has more to do with the weapon’s
ability to absorb incoming power than with the outlet’s ability to provide it!
The later seems to be effectively limitless, at least on a personal scale. Yes,
these things are extremely unsafe. What happens if you stab someone with the
wired plug or intercept them with the arc of the wireless charger is left as an
exercise for the GM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some places you can also find portable batteries that can be used to top up a
weapon through a similar process. The GM will say how many shots from a weapon
an individual battery can recharge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;lunar-laser-rifle&quot;&gt;Lunar Laser Rifle&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Moonbase level of The New Order, everyone carries a laser weapon with the
same external appearance as the Marksman Rifle. It lacks a scope, and can fire
in full-auto mode. Its performance seems to be about on par with the assault
rifle, though it is a lot better at dealing with heavily-armored
enemies. Industrial outlets recharge it at 3 shots per second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being a laser weapon based on the Marksman Rifle, Nazi soldiers don’t
usually use Aim maneuvers with it, so they are no more accurate than usual when
wielding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t exist in The New Colossus, not even on Venus. Maybe it was a pet
project of Deathshead’s for the moon base, and got phased out when he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;marksman-rifle-combined&quot;&gt;Marksman Rifle (Combined)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you return to Earth after the Moonbase level, B.J.’s Marksman Rifle becomes
a combination gadget of sorts, with the scope on a hinged mount. With the mount
closed and the scope in place, it fires bullets as before. With the scope folded
away, it behaves like the Moonbase laser rifle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This design is probably more of a video game quality of life decision than
something feasible in setting, but if you want to include it in your campaigns
you can treat it as a Combination Gadget per the rules on Ultra-Tech p. 16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under those rules, Weight becomes 8kg/0.35kg (or 8.7/1.05 with the extended
mag). Switching modes requires a Ready maneuver, and the weapon uses the Damage,
Acc, Range, RoF, Shots and ST of whatever version is the currently active
one. Keep track of both ammo counts separately!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;laserkraftwerk&quot;&gt;Laserkraftwerk&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an experimental laser weapon that B. J. “liberates” from a lab early in
The New Order. It’s about carbine-sized, and fires shots that are more powerful
than those of the lunar laser rifle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LKW also has an alternate “laser cutter” module that’s useful for quietly
severing chains and cutting through chain-link fences and thin metal walls. This
does 2d(2) burn and can run continuously for half an hour on a full battery, if
it matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the game, the player can find several upgrades for the LKW,
including a scope, a double-capacity battery, and new internal parts that allow
it to fire more often or to fire a more powerful “charged” shot that’s better at
dealing with large and heavily armored opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Weapon Table below, you get stats both for the baseline version and the
fully-upgraded one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial outlets recharge the weapon at a rate of 1 shot per second with the
standard battery, or 2 shots per second with the expanded one. The final upgrade
in The New Order is an “ancient supertech” portable reactor that recharges the
weapon at a rate of 1 shot per 2 seconds whenever it’s not being fired,
regardless of its battery size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**: Drains power equivalent to 5 shots from the battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grenades-and-launchers&quot;&gt;Grenades and Launchers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enemy soldiers are enthusiastic about using hand grenades in the The New Order,
and only a little less so in The New Colossus. Launcher weapons are much rarer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In The New Order, enemies use the same &lt;strong&gt;Hand Grenade&lt;/strong&gt; from the previous post
in the 1946 prologue. By 1960 they’ve switched to using Tesla grenades
exclusively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;tesla-grenade&quot;&gt;Tesla Grenade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks like a modernized version of the Stick Hand Grenade used back
in 1946. Its explosive power is equivalent, but also releases an electromagnetic
pulse that can “stun” robotic and cybernetic enemies in a 4-meter radius from
the epicenter of the explosion. They must make a HT-8(2) roll or be knocked out
of action for seconds equal to their margin of failure. That (2) means that any
electromagnetic shielding that would provide a bonus to this roll only works at
half effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; applies to battery-powered weapons of any kind, which usually have
HT 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;underbarrel-rocket-launcher&quot;&gt;Underbarrel Rocket Launcher&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An accessory compatible with the 1960 Assault Rifle, this launcher fires 40mm
anti-armor rockets from a removable cylinder with a 4-round capacity. It’s
issued to soldiers that are expected to go against heavily-armored opposition,
and who are usually heavily-armored themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The launcher can only be used if it’s attached to another weapon. By default
that’s the assault rifle, which has the rails to receive it, but players might
decide to get creative with their jury-rigging. It adds its weight to the
overall weight of the other weapon and worsens its Bulk by -1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the standard skill system, this uses the Guns (LAW) skill. In the alternate
one, it’s Guns (Long Arm) aided by the Payload Warhead technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heavy-weapons&quot;&gt;Heavy Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;laser-machine-gun&quot;&gt;Laser Machine Gun&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old Venom machine gun from the war has been replaced with this energy weapon
in the Sixties. Like its predecessor, the Laser MG is found in fixed mounts, in
the hands of cybernetic supersoldiers, and mounted on the many models of giant
robot stomping around. It can fire for quite a bit before running dry. This can
look like either a sequence of rapid pulses or a continuous beam, but either
version uses the same stats. Enemies don’t like to aim with it either, improving
the players’ chances of survival when facing it. It’s heavy and bulky enough to
be only a “sometimes” gun for the player, used when found and quickly discarded
when empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industrial outlets reload it at a rate of 20 shots per second. When attached to
a fixed mount, the weapon’s Acc improves to 18, and it’s recharged as if
connected to an outlet when not firing. Attaching or detaching it takes 2 Ready
maneuvers. The weapon uses the Gunner (Beams) skill even when detached.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Seth belongs to the Da’at Yichud, an ancient society of engineers that had
been building superscience devices as a form of worship since before the
rest of humanity had organized religion. Deathshead’s inventions are all
copied from one of their vaults, which he found in the 40s. I’ve seen the
concept described as kinda problematic despite the designers’ best
intentions. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Guns of Wolfenstein, Part 02: The Old Blood</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2022/11/04/guns-of-wolfenstein.html&quot;&gt;our previous article&lt;/a&gt;, we took a look at the guns that appear on Return
to Castle Wolfenstein (2001), whose timeline I named “Wolfenstein-1” for ease of
reference. In this one, we’ll take a look at the timeline I called
“Wolfenstein-2”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wolfenstein-2 setting is the chronology used by the trilogy of games made up
of Wolfenstein: The New Order (2014), Wolfenstein: The Old Blood (2015) and
Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus (2017). The Old Blood is a prequel to The New
Order, so it happens first even though it’s the second game. We’ll talk about it
in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plot-overview-contains-spoilers&quot;&gt;Plot Overview (Contains Spoilers)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Blood is a retelling of the “escape from Castle Wolfenstein” story that
made up the first two chapters of the 2001 game. Where the Wolfenstein-1 version
was just a pulpier version of WW2, this one goes all in on the alternate history
approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like World War 2 in the Wolfenstein-2 timeline starts off more or less
like it did in our world, but things go off the rails somewhere along the
way. Deathshead, the same mad scientist from the 2001 game, is wildly more
successful at coming up with absurd weapons and getting them mass-produced. As a
result the war streches for longer than it did in our world. The game happens in
&lt;em&gt;1946&lt;/em&gt;, with the war still raging on and the Allies on the losing side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in the 2001 game, B.J. Blazkowicz and Agent One infiltrate Castle
Wolfenstein. Their goal here is more well-defined - among the documents stored
in the castle, there’s a folder that details the location of Deathshead’s secret
fortress, where he’s been developing all these superweapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Castle here is much larger than it was in the first game, and has been
upgraded from its medieval roots into a giant concrete fortress full of
superscience security measures, including prototype supersoldiers tethered to
power lines. Its owner is still an occult-obsessed Nazi officer named Helga, who
now works under Deathshead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broad outline of events is the same - the two get captured, Agent One dies
under torture, Blazko escapes the castle. He heads to the nearby village of
Wolfburg, where Helga leads an archaeological dig in search of buried occult
secrets. Whatever she does triggers a sort of zombie apocalypse. Helga releases
a giant zombie and dies failing to control it. B. J. escapes with the secret
document folder after killing said zombie, completing his mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-guns&quot;&gt;The Guns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the usable guns in this game are captured Nazi hardware, since you start
the game proper unarmed save for a (surprisingly effective) sharpened metal
pipe. This “early” in the timeline, a lot of the weapons presented here still
have real-world equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pistols&quot;&gt;Pistols&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pistol-model-1946&quot;&gt;Pistol Model 1946&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is still mostly a &lt;strong&gt;Luger P08&lt;/strong&gt; (p. HT98), with the only difference being
that it has a 10-round magazine instead of an 8-round one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It accepts a suppressor, which is available to you from the start. It weights
0.25kg, adds -1 to Bulk and makes the gun &lt;em&gt;cinematically silent&lt;/em&gt;. This means
enemies won’t notice the gun firing unless a bullet impacts the environment near
them, or if they survive being shot by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rifles&quot;&gt;Rifles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;assault-rifle-model-46-t&quot;&gt;Assault Rifle Model 46-T&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is still pretty much a &lt;strong&gt;StG-44&lt;/strong&gt; (p. HT115). It has a folding foregrip not
present in the real weapon, but that doesn’t affect its stats in any way either
in the computer game or in GURPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;marksman-rifle-bombenschluss&quot;&gt;Marksman Rifle (Bombenschluss)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is likely a version of the &lt;strong&gt;Mauser Kar98K&lt;/strong&gt; (p. HT111). Unlike the real
weapon, this one’s magazine is inserted from the side, which means the gun can
still be fired from a prone position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two obtainable upgrades. The first is a 10-round extended magazine
that adds -1 to Bulk and weights 0.44kg loaded. The other is a scope on a
tacticool folding mount. It adds 0.5kg to weight and changes Acc to 5+2. It can
be folded in or out of position with a Ready maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shotguns&quot;&gt;Shotguns&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;double-barreled-shotgun&quot;&gt;Double Barreled Shotgun&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 10-gauge classic makes two appearances: at the start of the game with a
full length barrel, and at the end with the barrel sawn off to “whippet”
length. The full-length gun uses the same stats as the &lt;strong&gt;Lefevre Automatic
Hammerless&lt;/strong&gt; from High Tech. The sawn-off one uses the stats below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;shockhammer&quot;&gt;Shockhammer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a semi-automatic 12-gauge shotgun with a Rube Goldberg action. The gun
takes shells from a revolving cylinder that alternates between its twin barrels
with every cycle, which is supposed to allow for a higher rate of fire. The
stats below are somewhat inspired by the &lt;strong&gt;Daewoo USAS-12&lt;/strong&gt; from High Tech, but
there are enough differences to warrant its own stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A possible upgrade here is a 20-round cylinder that changes Shots to 20(5) and
Weight to 8.2/2.1kg.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grenades-and-launchers&quot;&gt;Grenades and Launchers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;hand-grenade&quot;&gt;Hand Grenade&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enemy soldiers use a version of the historical &lt;strong&gt;“stick hand grenade 24”&lt;/strong&gt;
filled with TNT, as mentioned in p. HT190: Damage 7d cr ex, weight 0.7kg, Fuse
4-5. They’re not shy about throwing them at you if you stay for more than a few
seconds behind cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;kampfpistole-war-pistol&quot;&gt;Kampfpistole (“war pistol”)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a version of a historical flare gun used in WW2 that could also fire
grenades. Its extremely limited ammo is the best choice for taking out the
tankiest enemies in the game, so I think it fires the HEAT round described in
High Tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;heavy-weapons&quot;&gt;Heavy Weapons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see another familiar face here: the &lt;strong&gt;Venom Heavy Machine Gun&lt;/strong&gt;, which loses
its edgy name but is basically the same weapon I already covered in my &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2022/11/04/guns-of-wolfenstein.html&quot;&gt;previous
post on Wolfenstein guns&lt;/a&gt;. It’s found in the hands of early-model
supersoldiers, and has 250 round belts weighting 10kg. Even a beefy guy like
B. J. has trouble carrying it around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incarnation of the Venom is excellent to mow down human soldiers and
zombies, but doesn’t actually do much to the supersoldiers that carry
it. Therefore we can assume it fires regular ammo instead of armor-piercing: Dam
6d+2 pi.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quar and Their Guns in GURPS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I became aware of the Quar. Aren’t they neat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/quar-unit.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
  A squad of Quar soldiers, with officers, standard-bearer, and messenger
  squirrel handler. Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rhyfler.com&quot;&gt;https://rhyfler.com&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These funny anteater people are the stars of a couple of miniature wargames, the
28mm-scale &lt;strong&gt;Clash of Rhyfles&lt;/strong&gt; and the 15mm-scale &lt;strong&gt;This Quar’s War&lt;/strong&gt;. Both of
these have their rulebooks freely available &lt;a href=&quot;https://rhyfler.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which is also where the
image above comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An individual Quar is a funny little person who just wants to chill with a hot
cup of tea and a plate of moth cakes. Quar &lt;em&gt;societies&lt;/em&gt; however are very, er,
quarrelsome, so most of their history is an endless procession of wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was motivated to write this article both because I think the setting is neat,
and because the technical information about Quar weapons in the Clash of Rhyfles
game made me think I can stat them up in GURPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;very-short-setting-summary&quot;&gt;Very Short Setting Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wargames cover a particularly turbulent period in the history of Aldwyn, the
Quar home world. It’s marked by at least twenty years of worldwide trench
warfare between two large multinational coalitions. The tech level is somewhere
between WW1 and WW2, and this is pretty much the war that introduced industrial
warfare to their world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the idea of these adorable creatures being fed into one of the worst
meat-grinders imaginable is horrifying to you, then you get the setting’s main
idea. I’ve heard it described as “grimsical”. It replaces the “dark” vibe from
“grimdark” with “whimsical”, but it’s still grim. The cuter the miniatures for
their soldiers and tanks get, the stronger the dissonance becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Clash or Rhyfles quickstart book centers on the two main factions of the
war. The Crusade is a coalition of former monarchies who successfully toppled
their old regimes and became republics. They’re led by the Republic of Tok, and
made up of many smaller nations that follow the same standards for equipment and
tactics. The rules here could be used for quar from any of those places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, the Kingdom of Coftyr leads an alliance of the world’s
remaining monarchies to stamp out this revolution. Each kingdom here tends to be
visually distinct, as their whole thing is adherence to ancient traditions and
heraldry. Therefore, the book only covers Coftyr itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free add-ons provide details for “sub-factions” allied to either side. These are
Crusader or monarchist nations who do their own thing on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual for wargames, both sides are morally ambiguous. Opposing monarchy is a
good thing in my book, but the Crusade is also the side that introduced
industrial warfare to the world. Coftyr flavor text is all about honor and
chivalry and heroism, but they adopted industrial warfare just as readily and at
the end of the day are still defenders of absolute monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get the impression that the world of Alwyn could settle into a more or less
stable configuration if everyone just stopped and signed a status quo peace
treaty, but they’ve all been fighting for 20 years by now and none of their
leaders show any sign of wanting to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual for wargames, you pick the side you think looks neater, paint them up,
and pit them against other factions in battles that would fit somewhere in those
decades of war. Most of these battles focus on infantry with the occasional
tanks thrown in. There seem to be airships, but I don’t know if they have
airplanes yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quar-in-gurps&quot;&gt;Quar in GURPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical Quar is about 1.5 meters tall and weights around 60kg. They follow a
largely humanoid body plan. Their skins can take on any of a large number of
hues, from yellows and greens to blues and purples and oranges. Often, they’re a
little mottled. Their diet tends to include lots of bugs, though those are often
prepared as ingredients in dishes that we would otherwise recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stat-wise, I’d say they are absolutely identical to humans. If you insist on
being strict, make them about a foot shorter than their ST would indicate, but
do not adjust their stats in any other way. Being a Quar costs 0 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that’s the thing, you see? Quar are just people. The horrors inflicted
on them are horrible because &lt;em&gt;war&lt;/em&gt; is horrible, not because Quar are adorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quar-guns-in-gurps&quot;&gt;Quar Guns in GURPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guns in Clash or Rhyfles don’t actually have damage ratings, just range and
optional traits. The results of a ranged attack roll depend entirely on the
degree of success for your skill roll. They might leave a target unaffected,
Gobsmacked (stunned) or Taken Out, which is different from “dead”: they might
still be rescued during or after the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the skirmish game rules include enough fluff about the infantry weapons
of the Crusade that I kinda want to try statting them up in GURPS. If I ever get
the same information for the Coftyri ones, I’ll stat them up too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book mentiones the muzzle velocity and caliber of a couple of the weapons,
and if I make a guess about the weight of the bullet I can plug those three
things in the simplest possible version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamingballistic.com/2022/04/11/old-ballistics-spreadsheet-a-repost/&quot;&gt;unofficial official GURPS
ballistics equation&lt;/a&gt; to get a damage figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That link also contains a complete spreadsheet that demands things like chamber
pressure, which I have no chance of figuring out. So stuff like Accuracy and
range will be derived by the older method of eyeballing existing guns, as will
bullet weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers in the original material are just there for color, of course. None
of them affect the rules of the miniature wargame itself. But if we take them as
true, we see that Quar are very fond guns with big bullets and powerful
propellant charges, fired out of guns with short barrels and very light
construction. The recoil on those is gonna be ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bogen-rifle&quot;&gt;The Bogen Rifle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signature weapon of the Crusade rhyfler, the Bogen semi-automatic rifle is
said to fire a 12mm bullet at 580m/s. It uses a 5 or 10 round magazine and
weights 2.4kg “fully loaded”. Its effective range is 150-250 meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest real-world bullet to this one in GURPS High-Tech is the
.45-something family of rifle rounds, which are 11.43mm in diameter and weight
31 grams. After some fiddling, I decide to go with a slightly lower 27 grams for
the Quar bullet, which gives us exactly 7d damage. This is pi+ because of the
caliber. Picture them as being broader, shorter and rounder than Earth rifle
cartridges, which is in theme for all things Quar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives us a gun that packs about the same punch as a real-world M1 Garand
rifle while having almost exactly half its weight and about the length of an M16
assault rifle. That’s going to have a significant kick, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bogen&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7d pi+&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;900/3500&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5(3)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;11†&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rhyshi-r4-heavy-rifle&quot;&gt;The Rhyshi (R4) Heavy Rifle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only slightly longer than the Bogen, the Rhyshi fires a huge 20mm round with a
720m/s muzzle velocity. Its magazine carries seven of those, and it’s said to
require a solid stance and firm support to shoot with any kind of accuracy. A
squad mate’s shoulder will do for support, according to the book, but I’m going
to give this rifle an integral folding bipod because I’m not a monster. A
properly braced R4 has greater range than the Bogen, and can penetrate up to
“medium” vehicular armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest thing to this I can find on High-Tech is the Mauser Tank-Gewehr 18,
the WW1 German anti-tank rifle. Its caliber is “only” 13mm, but it’s the largest
anti-tank rifle in that table that is even removely Quar-portable. Plugging its
bullet mass, caliber and printed velocity in our magic spreadsheet, we get 10d+3
damage, which following High-Tech convention can be rounded and written as
5dx2. Let’s also give it an armor-piercing round, because I see the WW1 tank
examples in the book have DR 45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5dx2 is the same damage as the T-Gew18, but the Rhyshi again weights less than
half of what the real gun does. It’s not that much longer than the Bogen either,
so it’s gonna be a beast to handle unless it’s properly braced. As the book
says, Quar Crusaders frequently attach a bayonet to the Rhyshi because there’s
no way it can be fired in close quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Rhyshi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5dx2(2) pi+&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1100/4400&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7.5kg/1kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7(3)&lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grifkis-shotgun&quot;&gt;Grifkis Shotgun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a 10-gauge, six-kilo trench gun firing buckshot ammo. The only Crusade
gun to still be largely hand-made, it’s carried by officers as a badge of honor
and a symbol of courage. The illustration shows its barrel is fairly short, but
it still has a shoulder stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need to fiddle with spreadsheets this time, we have a 10G double-barrel
shotgun in High Tech. Let’s borrow its stats and adjust for the shortened
“whippet” barrels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Grifkis&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2d-1 pi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;40/800&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6kg/0.15kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2x13&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2(3i)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;12†&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;1/7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short barrels give this gun a more pronounced muzzle blast (+1 to Hearing
and Vision to locate when fired in the dark). I’m using the listed weight for it
here, which makes it about 50% heavier than the real world example from
High-Tech. Big caliber, two barrels, extra chonky? This is basically the Doom
Super Shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;h-11a-light-machine-gun&quot;&gt;H-11a Light Machine Gun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the book, this LMG fires the same round as the Bogen rifle, and the
Crusade likes to use it as an offensive squad support weapon. It appears longer
than the rifle, and can also be used in vehicular mounts when the force can’t
find heavier MGs to put in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’m just going to crib from High-Tech again, and blend some of the
Bogen’s stats with those of the MG34.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;H-11a&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7d pi+&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;900/3500&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;15kg/2.5kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;50(5)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;12B†&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives us a gun that’s actually heavier than the Rhyshi rifle, and whose
recoil is manageable enough that it’s worth firing more than one bullet per
turn. It fires rounds from a non-disintegrating cloth belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at those things. Just look at them. Their damage values combined with the
light weight and short barrel means they have &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt; powder charges. Quar
like big booms and they cannot lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recoil on these things means the act of firing them is somewhere between
“comical” and “painful for the shooter”. I’m guessing that a Taken Out result in
the wargame very often means the target got spooked and decided to play dead,
instead of actually being hit. This also explains why a quar can take
&lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; out on a bad skill roll.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ultra-Tech Dungeon Delving in GURPS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started writing this post a few years ago when I was GMing the Iron Gods
adventure path for Pathfinder using the Dungeon Fantasy RPG rules. My approach
to that campaign was pretty slap-dash, and after I stopped I began thinking of a
more structured way to do it. Since a recent comment here on the blog asked for
specifics, I though I’d dust the post off and publish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have a Dungeon Fantasy game where you want your characters to get
into contact with more advanced technology. How would you go about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ultra-tech-delving-a-survey&quot;&gt;Ultra-Tech Delving: A Survey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jackson games did a little foray into this area in Pyramid #3/60, in an
article entitled “High-Tech Dungeon Crawl”, which focused on bringing modern-day
characters with guns into fantasy dungeons to mow down orcs with autofire and
take their stuff. This raises the inherent level of colonalism in the genre from
“concerning” to “yikes!”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to focus on here is in an older variation on the theme: fantasy
characters exploring “dungeons” filled with elements you might be more used to
seeing in science fiction stories. When I say “older”, I mean it’s &lt;em&gt;older than
D&amp;amp;D&lt;/em&gt;: Dave Arneson’s Blackmoor campaign featured a whole ultra-tech city-state
descended from the crew of a crashed spaceship, and it was played for several
years before what became the OD&amp;amp;D rules were finalized and officially
published. D&amp;amp;D proper would explore the same territory with its famous
“Expedition to the Barrier Peaks” module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathfinder dedicates a whole kingdom in its setting to the idea: the land of
Numeria is a barbarian kingdom where a giant spaceship crashed millenia ago,
breaking up during atmospheric entry and scattering its many modules all over
the region. And, of course, in Gamma World and other post-apocalyptic games
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; “dungeons” are ultra-tech because they’re the ruins of the futuristic
civilization that preceded the apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ultra-tech-delving-in-gurps&quot;&gt;Ultra-Tech Delving in GURPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GURPS is of course a uniquely well-suited system for this kind of thing. Its
rules already support a wide range of genres and technology levels from the
corebook onwards. We only need a few adjustments depending on the sort of
campaign we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After The End&lt;/em&gt; already deals with the post-apocalyptic angle and offers a set
of detailed rules. What I want, however, is something simpler and more suited to
a Barrier Peaks/Numeria scenario. The ultra-tech stuff is alien, but characters
can gain an understanding of it with some investment, and the gap between their
usual medievalish milieu and the lofty heights of alien tech isn’t completely
impossible to cross. How would I do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tech-level-or-the-lack-thereof&quot;&gt;Tech Level, or the Lack Thereof.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on one side we have the usual “medievalish” dungeon fantasy setting. In
GURPS, that’s roughtly TL 4, but without gunpowder. On the other side we have a
space-opera intrusion, which corresponds very roughly to a TL9-10 selection with
a few outliers (personal shields are TL11-12, but they fit the flavor). With
these vague numbers in mind, we can ditch the concept of Tech Levels completely
for our treatment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Default GURPS Tech Level rules are only useful for giving us a starting set of
gadgets to work with. In actual play, the only thing that matters is if a given
thing is “low-tech” and thus familiar to everyone, or “high-tech” and thus a
mystery to the uninitiated. How to differentiate both? With the following
advantage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tech-familiarity-10-points&quot;&gt;Tech Familiarity (10 points)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a layman’s knowledge of the basic principles behind the advanced
technology scattered through your otherwise medieval fantasy world. You
understand why it isn’t magic. You know about electricity and how it powers
high-tech devices. You grasp enough of the high-tech design aesthetic to easily
spot a device’s charging port or battery, its control surfaces (be they
switches, triggers, or touchpads), its information displays, and its business
end even if you don’t know what the thing actually &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;. You can identify the
high-tech civilization’s writing even though you can’t read it, and you can
identify its iconography for “danger”. You can also recognize hazards like
exposed live wires, recognize which type of power cell goes into a device, and
plug it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a form of Unusual Background that makes you immune to the sort of
amusing accident which plagues other low-tech explorers confronted with
high-tech devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, Tech Familiarity is a pre-requisite for learning high-tech
skills, and the language of the high-tech civilization (if any). With this
advantage, you can spend points on those things normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is quite similar to High TL from the core book, but much cheaper. The
reason is that paying 30-35 points in High TL to get the same benefits is way
too expensive for a campaign in this mold. This advantage doesn’t give you any
familiarity with deeper aspects of the high-tech civilization, just what’s in
the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tech-skills&quot;&gt;Tech Skills&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills that would require a /TL specialization in standard GURPS rules have only
two versions here: standard (no suffix) and “/Tech”. That way, you don’t need to
change anything about how you write down a standard “medievalish” character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two specialties don’t overlap at all: they don’t default to each other, and
can’t be used at all across the “tech divide”. If you only have standard
Lockpicking, you can’t open a high-tech door with a magnetic lock. If you only
have Lockpicking/Tech, you can’t open low-tech mechanical locks with
old-fashioned picks, tough you might be able to operate a machine that does it
for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-tech weapons are usually firearms of beam weapons - the skills to operate
them properly are always “/Tech” skills. High-Tech &lt;em&gt;melee&lt;/em&gt; weapons are a
possible exception to the “no defaults” rule above, though the GM would need to
rule on each case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons that use the same skill as their low-tech counterparts can be used
normally by anyone if the only difference is in their construction (such as a
superfine or hyperdense blade). If they have some additional feature that
requires power (such as a vibroblade or shock baton) then the character has a -2
penalty to use that feature unless they have Tech Familiarity. If they require
an exclusive skill to operate (like a force sword or monowire whip) then that
skill has the “/Tech” suffix. You might be able to get away with a default to a
low-tech skill here, but the only way to improve on that is to buy Tech
Familiarity and the high-tech skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ultra-tech-gear&quot;&gt;Ultra-Tech Gear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the character stuff out of the way, we can talk about the goodies! As I
mentioned above, one advantage of GURPS is that it has entire books of high- and
ultra-tech gadgets that can be plugged straight into your fantasy
campaigns. Therefore, we don’t need to talk about how to stat this stuff up at
all! What we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need is talk about the effects it’s going to have on your
campaign, which in turn will aid you in selecting which items to include.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-much-is-this-stuff-worth&quot;&gt;How much is this stuff worth?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vital question in the dungeon fantasy genre! Going more or less by the book,
high-tech items should be worth roughly 30 times their list price in a dungeon
fantasy setting. That makes even a relatively innocuous gadget into a major
piece of loot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem a bit too much for a dungeon fantasy setting where magic and
magic items are relatively common, but I think it kinda makes sense. Ultra-tech
items are going to be a lot rarer than magic items, particularly in settings
where they come from that single crashed spaceship. They work regardless of the
local mana and sanctitiy levels. And they can be enchanted! These are exactly
the same reasons why a suit of fine plate armor costs more than a standard suit
enchanted with Lighten 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: A superfine broadword would cost $3600 in its native ultra-tech
society. Recovered from a crashed spaceship in a dungeon fantasy setting, it’s
worth $108,000!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sword gives a +2 bonus to damage and a (2) armor divisor. The closest
“low-tech” equivalent would be a very fine sword with a Penetrating Weapon
enchantment, worth $17,000, almost ten times cheaper. Even if all the bonuses
were from magic, it would still cost only $25,600. However, the superfine blade
will lose none of its functionality in a low- or no-mana zone, and it could be
enchanted with the same magic as the low-tech sword to become even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think that this is too much, you could say that the value of
ultra-tech gear is capped by the value of magic items with similar
properties. The sword from the example would be worth $17,000 then. Gear that
has no magical equivalent might still use the “uncapped” price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;timeworn-gear&quot;&gt;Timeworn Gear&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One concept from Pathfinder that’s useful to borrow is that of timeworn
items. In Barrier Peaks-style setups, most of the high-tech stuff the PCs come
across has been sitting around in derelict ruins for a very long time; even if
it was very well-built, it might not have withstood the passage of the ages
intact. To model that, we introduce the following equipment modifier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeworn&lt;/strong&gt;: This can be applied to any high-tech armor, weapon, or device that
requires power or ammunition to function. These items can’t be recharged. After
whatever reserves they contain when found are used up, they’ll break down and
become useless. They may also have other quirks arising from their almost-broken
state at the GM’s discretion. Divide final price by 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weapons-and-armor&quot;&gt;Weapons and Armor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons and armor deserve special mention because Dungeon Fantasy is a
combat-heavy genre, and this combat has a very specific “feel” to it. Therefore,
high-tech combat gear will have an outsize impact on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baseline Dungeon Fantasy suggests that PCs should have a maximum total DR of
about 15, as anything more than that will make them invulnerable to too many
monster attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PC damage also has some upper bounds. Spellcasters with missile spells and a
spellcasting talent of 6 can do a maximum of 18d damage, though that requires
enough setup to only be possible about once per fight, and not on all
fights. The maximum amount of “at-will” melee and ranged damage a PC can do is
equivalent to about 7d per attack&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing ultra-tech armor into the game almost certainly means you’re going
to exceed the DR cap. Even non-combat safety gear at these tech levels has as
much DR as low-tech plate, while being much lighter. Proper combat armor is much
tougher. Most of the published DF enemies will have trouble getting past the DR
of a PC in full ultra-tech armor with their physical attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, high-tech weapons can change the shape of combat in your
campaign. Dungeon Fantasy usually considers melee to be the main event and
ranged combat to be a specialist niche, but if guns and beam weapons are common
these two are going to swap places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultra-tech melee and ranged weapons can also allow PCs to approach or exceed the
upper damage bounds described above much more easily. Both “boundaries” are
roughly equivalent to rolling 7d of damage per attack. A force sword does 8d; a
laser rifle does 6d, and can can fire many more shots per turn than a bow with
no penalty. Both of those have armor divisors too, which make enemy DR become
much less of an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step when addressing these issues is to carefully consider which items
are available. What do you want your campaign’s new DR cap to be? What is the
highest armor divisor you’re comfortable with? What sort of maximum damage do
you want your PCs to do with a melee or ranged attack they can use every second?
And, to quote Mister Torgue from Borderlands 2: EXPLOSIONS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second step is to consider the same thing from the side of the opposition:
what’s the highest DR and damage you estimate &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; will be able to routunely
bring to the table? The gear available to the PCs should give them a chance to
match those figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then safely remove anything that exceeds your new planned limits. That
will end up giving you a pretty good set of guidelines for what the ultra-tech
culture and their ruins look like. A civilian medical lab infested with
non-sapient monsters and low-tech looters might have plenty of medkits and
wonder drugs, but no weapon heavier than a couple of timeworn electrolasers and
some scalpels the thief can use as superfine daggers. For a military base filled
with killer robots and with a tank at the end as a boss fight, the sky is the
limit, though those anti-tank weapons might all be timeworn if you don’t want
the PCs using them outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The article itself includes a section titled “The Sociological
Ramifications are Appalling”. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A ST 20 Knight with Weapon Master and a halberd can easily attack twice
every turn and do 3d+13 per attack. This is theoretically possible right out
of character creation if your knight is a half-ogre. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A ST 20 Scout with Weapon Master and Strongbow might be able to shoot once
per turn and do about 4d+10 per shot. This particular boundary is hard to
reach, so your highest “at-will” ranged damage will probably be less than
that. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read Hell&apos;s Rebels: Adventure 04, Part 3</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell&apos;s_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re firmly in the wrap-up stage now. If you’re here, the PCs have succeeded at
dismantling the powerful magical defenses of the Temple of Asmodeus and
disrupted a dire summoning ritual that was Barzilai Thrune’s last attempt at
squashing the Silver Raven rebellion. They made it out with a literal dragon’s
hoard worth of loot and if they were particularly skilled they might even have
managed to kill Thrune himself during the raid! In this post, we’ll see what all
of that means for the rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strategic-and-campaign-implications&quot;&gt;Strategic and Campaign Implications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the rebellion is concerned, it has achieved its major goal. All of the
Thrune leadership has been neutralized one way or the other, ceding control of
not just Kintargo but the entire province of Ravounel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few days immediately after the PC’s victory at the temple are a flurry
of activity as the former rebel organization sets itself up as the new
government. If Jilia Bailinus has been rescued and revived (a likely outcome),
then she’s immediately reinstated as Lord Mayor. Otherwise the job goes to a
sympatethic noble or priestly NPC - the players should have some input on who
gets the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new mayor will have several difficult issues to solve in the medium term,
but for now it’s time to celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-silver-span-celebration&quot;&gt;The Silver Span Celebration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the PC’s heroics quickly become common knowledge, now that there is no
more need for secrecy on their part. Soon after they recover from the temple
raid, they and their allies are invited to a huge party in their honor. It takes
place on Bleakbridge - the same spot where the PCs busted a blockade in Part 01
of the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place is quite crowded now. A wooden stage has been erected right in the
middle of the bridge, where a whole bunch of statues are covered with cloth
awaiting for their unveiling. The PCs, every single member of the Silver Ravens,
and anyone else whom they had positive interactions with will be at the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time after the party gets going, the mayor calls the PCs up to the stage,
makes a speech renaming the bridge from Bleakbridge to the Silver Span, and
unveils the statues. These represent all the PCs, plus any NPCs who were
especially important to the rebellion’s success at the group’s discretion. These
are going to be installed along the Silver Span, as an eternal reminder of their
heroic deeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCs themselves are then presented with silver Keys to the City! The keys are
worth quite a bit of money, but the real prize here is the major reputation
boost that comes with being recognized as an official hero. That’s a hefty bonus
to gather information or perform for money in the city, as well as a permanent
10% discount on all Kintargan shops that don’t have reason to actively hate the
characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can close the curtains on this adventure, however, there is the small
matter of the retributive strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-hells-heart&quot;&gt;From Hell’s Heart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… I stab at thee! That’s a particularly appropriate quote here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, right after the PCs receive those keys, the remnants of the Thrune
faction teleport in and try to kill the PCs. I don’t think they can take the
province back at this point - this is simply done out of spite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who the attackers are depend on what exactly happened so far. From the worst
case to the best one, we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barzilai on a Fucking Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;: If both Thrune and the dragon Rivozair are
still alive, they both show up, with Thrune riding the dragon. This happens
even if Rivozair fled the city after being defeated by the PCs in their
previous confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barzilai OR a Fucking Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;: if either one of the pair is dead, the other
still attacks. Rivozair shows up alone; Thrune appears accompanied by four
bone devils.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dregs&lt;/strong&gt;: If both main baddies are dead, the GM should build a CR 13
encounter with any secondary villains who managed to escape death over the
course of the adventure, focusing on those the players loved to hate the
most. If there are not enough to hit CR 13 on their own, fill the encounter
with appropriate minions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No One!&lt;/strong&gt;: Particularly thorough groups might have not left anyone alive to
attempt revenge! The chance of this happening is quite low, as there are a lot
of named villains here and many of them will make an effort to escape when
first fought. But if this does happen, just skip this battle altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone shows up at all, they fight to the death this time around regardless
of their previous cowardice. This encounter is the “main event”, and it’s
accompanied by a “sideshow” in the form of a bunch of loyalist dottari and minor
devils who arrive more conventionally and try to slaughter the crowd. These keep
the rest of the NPC Silver Ravens occupied, and are handled as series of
Security checks to prevent civilian deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thrune remains as hard to kill as ever, but this time the PCs are fully rested
and have no other encounters to worry about. And with all those NPCs present,
someone is bound to have a handy spell to finish him off if the PCs don’t have
one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;victory-tally&quot;&gt;Victory Tally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this fight is over, we finally get to tally the party’s XP award for
liberating Kintargo. This depends entirely on how many inhabitants have survived
the whole ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city starts the game with 11900 inhabitants, according to its stat sheet in
the Player’s Guide. The GM is supposed to keep track of this number from the
start of the campaign until now. There are several events in the strategic layer
(Thrune reprisals, mostly) that kill a number of innocents and reduce this
number. Deaths of innocents during the “tactical adventuring” portions also
reduce the number - for example, the Ruby Masquerade trap, or if the PCs fail to
rescue a sacrifice victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the city has at least 9000 surviving inhabitants at the end of this last
party, the game considers the rebellion an Unmitigated Success. 7500 or more
survivors makes for a Grim Success, and less than that is a pyrrhic victory
marked by Tragic Loss. I think it’s quite hard to end up with less than 9000
citizens unless the group completely fails to prevent the Ruby Masquerade
massacre and really slacks off during the “hot war” portion of this adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-chelish-crux&quot;&gt;The Chelish Crux&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This device, apparently a Hellraiser-style puzzle box, is also the plot coupon I
mentioned earlier. It sits inside Barzilai Thrune’s chest cavity - he replaced
his heart with it back during adventure 2. The book mentions that retrieving
this thing from Thrune’s corpse and opening it up are vital steps to proceed
with the remaining two adventures in the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concluding-the-adventure-and-what-happens-next&quot;&gt;Concluding the Adventure, and What Happens Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, nothing &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to happen from this point on. This is an excellent
stopping point for the campaign if the GM doesn’t feel like spending money on
the last two volumes. Just remove the Crux, and say that Barzilai has lost his
chance to become a genius loci by dying. He’s in Hell forever. Campaign
complete, mission accomplished, let’s leave nation-building to the government
and retire as glorious heroes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do want to continue playing Hell’s Rebels, though, then the Crux still
exists and the situation is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kintargo is free for now, and Cheliax is busy fighting the Glorious Reclamation
in its heartland, but that situation won’t last much longer. Cheliax will
eventually send an army to retake the city, which won’t be able to hold against
an all-out military assault. The key to solving that problem happens to be
inside the Chelish Crux, and we’ll deal with that in the next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barzilai himself isn’t exactly out of the picture either. Even dead, he’s still
on track to become a genius loci, and solving the Cheliax issue will actually
make that process much faster. Dealing with him once and for all is the subject
of the last adventure in the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell&apos;s_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I launch into a description of the big dungeon raid in this adventure, I
think it’s useful to go over some background information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;barzilais-desperation-move&quot;&gt;Barzilai’s Desperation Move&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we say back in the background for Adventure 01, Barzilai’s scheme to become a
genius loci will only work exactly as planned if he dies a natural death from
old age. So he very much wants to keep on living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as he sees he’s lost the upper hand in the rebellion (at Authority 0),
the dictator will turtle up in the Temple of Asmodeus, and will order its high
priest to enact a ritual to contact Mephistopheles directly. The ritual takes
three days and a lot of sacrifices to complete, and when it does Mephistopheles
answers by sending &lt;em&gt;six pit fiends&lt;/em&gt; to serve Barzilai and by giving him and all
his underlings a major boost in stats that’s going to last for a whole month. So
you can see why the PCs should be very interested in stopping this. This is why
the final part of this adventure is an assault on the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-song-of-silver&quot;&gt;The Song of Silver&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, after completing all the missions in Part 01 of this adventure, the
PCs should have eliminated some of Barzilai’s main goons and acquired everything
they need to perform the Song of Silver: the score, the lyrics, and control of
the Opera House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Song of Silver is a ritual developed by the original Silver Ravens. It must
be performed on stage at the Kintargo Opera House, though it doesn’t really
require an audience beyond the PCs and maybe some of their main allies. It’s
short, taking only one minute to sing, and requires a skill test that should by
now be trivial for any bard in the party. Shensen can also sing it if there are
no PCs trained in Performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as it completes, the dome of the opera house shines with a bright light
and the whole city is enveloped in a protective field that lasts for seven
days. While it’s active, all weapons in the city count as being made of silver,
and all evil outsiders must succeed at a moderately difficult caster level check
to teleport or use similar abilities. The performer, every other PC, and up to
four additional allies also gain a major bonus on saves against charm and
compulsion effects, and become completely immune to fear. They can choose to end
this blessing to automatically pass a save, or to gain the effects of the
&lt;em&gt;breath of life&lt;/em&gt; spell (which yes, can return them to life if they die).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song can only be performed once a month - the PCs should ideally only need
to perform it once in this adventure. When it’s performed for the first time,
Barzilai’s Authority is reduced by 15 if that’s still an issue. It would be
optimal if the PCs went into the Temple while under the effects of the Song, as
it makes the assault much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-temple-of-asmodeus&quot;&gt;The Temple of Asmodeus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temple is a very large round building. It used to be dedicated to Aroden but
was converted to the worship of Asmodeus when House Thrune took over
Kintargo. The Asmodeans sacrificed all the remaining priests of the dead god
back then, turning them into undead that hang around the temple and help defend
it. In addition to this atrocious contingent, the place is as heavily fortified
as its current occupants could make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, when Thrune’s forces retreat to the temple its Asmodean
priests will begin a summoning ritual that will mean Game Over for the
rebellion. This takes 3 days to complete, so that’s the window of time the PCs
have to stop it. You should definitely inform them of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs can use rebellion actions to make their assault on the temple easier. These
require DC 30 Secrecy checks, so if you haven’t been tracking the Rebellion
rules so far, that’s where the PCs should put their +15. Their actions during
the previous missions will gain them allies that will further help with
this. One of the actions gives them a nearly complete map of the temple. The
other sabotages the ritual, making it take 6 days instead of 3, penalizing its
divine spellcasters (they’re demoralized!) and even reducing the frequency with
which the temple bells ring (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raiding-the-temple&quot;&gt;Raiding the Temple&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Temple of Asmodeus is a huuuge dungeon, and detailing every one of its rooms
would be a bigger slog than raiding the place in play. So let’s take a more
concise approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party has two main goals when raiding the temple: disrupt the infernal
ritual, and disable the cursed bells that are the temple’s main defense. This
will break the remaining morale of the Thrune leadership, and cause them to flee
the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing is to get inside. There are three double doors on the temple’s
ground floor and a balcony with another double door on the second floor. All
four are protected by a magical trap that can teleport a PC straight to Hell
unless it’s disarmed or dispelled first by the usual means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ground floor doors lead to empty foyer areas from which the PCs can either
go to the central nave or through doors into a series of small side rooms. The
balcony door leads directly into the rooms in the second floor loft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the PCs enter, they must contend with some temple-wide magical
defenses. There’s an effect similar to the Unhallow spell which is powered by a
pair of “infernal engines”. These engines also maintain a series of more
localized magical hazards inside the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After every fight in here, the bells gather 1d6 power points (1d4 if the ritual
was disrupted). When they reach 10 they ring, which inflicts a random bad effect
on the PCs. The Song of Silver can help resist some of them, but the only way to
stop the bells is to reach the belfry and exorcise them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ritual is happening in the nave on the center of the ground floor, but going
there directly is suicidal. The enemies at that location are not only a hard
encounter, they can also issue a general alert that will draw many of the
temple’s other defenders there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimal route would be to enter through the balcony, which puts the PCs on
the second floor loft where they can head more or less directly to the infernal
engines. This is something they should be able to figure out if they get the
full map through a covert action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each engine is a magic circle carved on the stone floor with an imprisoned
outsider inside. The circle slowly drains the outsider’s life force and uses it
to power the temple’s security system. Disabling them requires either expert use
of Thief skills, damaging the (very tough) floor carving, or killing the “fuel
source”. One holds a rakshasa, the other a lillend azata. Both have a high
number of negative levels and will gladly join in as temporary allies if those
are restored, despite their opposite alignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the engines disabled, it’s time to take care of the reinforcements. The
dragon Rivozair has most likely been defeated before the PCs make it into the
temple, but if that didn’t happen for some reason she will be in her lair here
on the second floor. She will join in to defend the ritual unless she’s defeated
first. In either case her hoard will be here, which is something to keep in mind
for after the dungeon is cleared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the reinforcements are in the side rooms on the ground floor. Most
of these rooms are used in the temple’s day to day activities and populated
either by the people and monsters responsible for those activities, or by
assigned defenders. Many of these would respond to a general alarm, but none of
them can raise one. Individually, each room is a medium-to-easy encounter, made
a bit easier by the fact that the engines are already off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the reinforcements neutralized and the engines disabled, it’s finally time
to assault the ritual. The team performing it can stop for long enough to put up
a fight: that’s High Priest Grivenner, five lower-ranking clerics, and five
summoned devils. Also in the room is a vampire high priestess of Zon-Kuthon (the
shadow-and-torture god) acting as a bodyguard, and a fiendish-shadow-snake thing
that will become a lot weaker with the infernal engines disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still a tough fight, but much more manageable without additional enemy
waves or magic hazards. Theoretically there are several ways to disrupt the
ritual, but “killing everyone involved” is probably the best one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optional-goal-kill-thrune&quot;&gt;Optional Goal: Kill Thrune&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time in the whole adventure path where the books recognize the
PCs might be able to fight Thrune and win. He’s holed up in his inner sanctum on
the second floor, though exceptionally stealthy PCs might be able to catch him
sleeping in his room. He’s a tough fight on par with the other boss battles in
this dungeon, but he’s definitely defeatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is he’s nearly &lt;em&gt;unkillable&lt;/em&gt;. The same infernal pact that lets him
survive without a heart also make him supernaturally resilient to HP damage. He
can keep operating normally until reduced from 206 all the way to -24 HP, after
which he becomes stunned. The stun only clears if he’s healed to above -24 HP,
but he does have access to a class ability that gives him fast healing and he
uses that at the start of every fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to kill him for real: total bodily destruction, or a certain
set of insta-death or soul-trapping spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first happens “naturally” if you get him to -191 HP (!) via standard damage
sources, basically turning his body into hamburger. It also happens if you hit
him with Destruction or Disintegrate spells when he’s below -24.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second consists of spells like &lt;em&gt;flesh to stone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;soul jar&lt;/em&gt;, and other such
magic that bypasses damage reduction. This triggers a clause in his infernal
contract that kills him instantly to prevent capture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Killing Barzilai here will prevent a later battle with him and will give the PCs
early access to a vital plot coupon, but it’s perfectly possible to bypass the
guy entirely. Given what awaits the PCs in the belfry, avoiding Thrune to
preserve resources is an equally valid choice as killing him early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raiding-the-profane-belfry&quot;&gt;Raiding the Profane Belfry&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dungeon is set up so that this is the last thing you do regardless of the
path you took through the Temple. It’s not an optional goal, and it’s no simple
victory lap either - it’s the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; final boss fight for the Temple of
Asmodeus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The belfry can only be accessed via the hole on the roof of the nave, which only
“unlocks” once both infernal engines have been deactivated. There are no
stairs - you need flight or teleport magic to get there. A couple of magical
traps lie in wait just past the lip of the hole. And then there are the
guardians: four powerful undead with an even stronger leader, all former priests
of Aroden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leader can and will ring one of the bells with his mind as a free action
every round, causing an effect much more powerful than the ones the party has
been experiencing so far. A Silence spell will prevent this, but will also
prevent the PCs from casting most spells too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hells-bells&quot;&gt;Hell’s Bells&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all guardians are destroyed, it’s time to exorcise the bells. The procedure
for this is quite elaborate and it’s definitely something I’d allow the PCs to
easily find out via prior research, because if they find themselves unprepared
here the whole raid was for nothing. They’re going to need to at least one
scroll of Hallow and five of Dispel Evil, though I’d also recommend multiple
spares for each one. Preparing these spells also works, of course, but it eats
into the number of slots they have available for the fights in the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steps 1 and 2 are disabling the infernal engines and killing the guardians. Done
and done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 3 is casting a Hallow spell on the belfry, or a Consecrate spell on each
of the five bells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 4 is drumming the chorus to the Song of Silver on one of the bells, which
requires a trivial Performance check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 5 is casting Dispel Evil on the same bell within a minute of drumming the
chorus on it. This causes the bell to begin glowing. A PC must then touch the
bell within 3 rounds (18 seconds). This will plunge the PC into a semi-real
vision related to the bell’s nature, and if the PC can endure and overcome the
vision, the bell is exorcised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure to perform the song’s chorus, to enter the vision in time, or to
overcome the vision causes the bell to ring a discordant note that dispels the
Hallow effect and possibly summons a devil. The PCs must fight the monster and
begin the process anew from step 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each vision, the GM describes the scene, lets the player describe their PCs
reaction to it, and then asks for a roll to overcome the ordeal. Good
roleplaying on the part of the PC can give a +5 on the roll. Success exorcises
the bell, failure deals ability drain and resets the procedure as above. The GM
should tailor the vision to the PC. Here’s a summary of the visions and their
tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bell of Torments&lt;/strong&gt;: The PC is being tormented in Hell by an enemy that
particularly vexed them in the past. After a while they realize they are holding
their favorite weapon, and can strike at their tormentor. &lt;em&gt;Test&lt;/em&gt;: Attack roll
vs. AC 28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bell of Slaves&lt;/strong&gt;: The PC is enslaved to a cruel master (someone who lorded
over them in the past), working on a grueling task. They must either tough it
out, escape their bonds, or stand up to their overlord. &lt;em&gt;Test&lt;/em&gt;: Player’s choice
of Fort, Ref, or Will vs. DC 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bell of Pride&lt;/strong&gt;: The PC is called before one of the gods to display their
skill or craft. Failing the test turns the vision into one of
humiliation. &lt;em&gt;Test&lt;/em&gt;: A Craft, Perform, or Knowledge skill test vs. DC 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bell of Tyrants&lt;/strong&gt;: The PC is the defendant in a trial where Barzilai is the
judge, and the PC’s friends and allies jeer at them from the crowd. The PC must
mound a successful defense. At the end of the trial, the crowd riots; on a
success, they tear the judge apart, on a failure they do it to the PC. &lt;em&gt;Test&lt;/em&gt;:
A social skill vs. DC 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bell of Infernal Darkness&lt;/strong&gt;: The PC is sharing a happy moment with a loved
one, when suddenly the &lt;em&gt;entire world&lt;/em&gt; becomes a giant Barzilai Thrune with a
black hole where his heart should be. The PC must lead the loved one away from
danger through a shifting surreal landscape. &lt;em&gt;Test&lt;/em&gt;: A movement skill
vs. DC 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tests seem to be calibrated so that only the PC most specialized in that
skill has a decent chance of success, so unless the GM is very cruel I’d
recommend giving advance warning that a different PC must touch each bell and
throwing the PC in question straight into the vision they are most likely to
overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;concluding-the-raid&quot;&gt;Concluding the Raid&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all bells have been properly exorcised, the temple can be considered
cleared. Any remaining defenders, including Barzilai himself, either flee or get
banished back to hell if they were summoned creatures. The party has some time
to finish looting the temple as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at what happens after they leave in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read Hell&apos;s Rebels 04, Part 01</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell&apos;s_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first three volumes of this adventure path were dedicated to building up the
Silver Ravens and their rebellion. Strikes against Thrune were indirect and
targeted peripheral facilities, which prevented the enemy from mounting a big
response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this changes at the very end of Adventure 03, where Barzilai lays a
deadly trap for the PCs and potentially kills a lot of innocents. At the start
of this one, Barzilai Thrune makes his final three proclamations: he outlaws the
Silver Ravens, he forbids worship of any god that’s not Asmodeus, and he
blockades the bridge that separates the two halves of the city. As soon as this
happens, his forces begin a brutal series of reprisals against the Ravens and
the population in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Silver Ravens immediately begin to fight back, since at this point their
rebellion has reached its maximum power and anyone who was even a little
sympathetic to them throws their full support behind the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzNs4-kRLaE&quot;&gt;shit’s going down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs start this adventure at level 10 and are expected to finish halfway into
level 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gming-the-rebellion&quot;&gt;GMing the Rebellion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of this adventure is dedicated to commanding the full might of the
rebellion to topple Barzilai Thrune. While you might have been able to ignore
the custom rebellion rules up until now, they’re unavoidable here. If you didn’t
bother with them before the book suggests assigning a default set of stats for
the organization (Notoriety 75%, focused stat +15, secondary stats +10). Those
numbers are higher than what’s on the Player Guide, probably to account for
bonuses the PCs would have gotten if they kept track of things in detail. Even
if you were using detailed rules before I recommend upgrading the org’s stats to
at least that level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Thrune’s government can be “killed”, it gets stats of its own. The
important one is Authority, which must be brought down to 0 for the Ravens to
win. When that happens, Thrune and his remaining lackeys lock themselves up in
the Temple of Asmodeus for a last-ditch desperation move, and the PCs can get at
them with a final assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCs and the Silver Ravens fight the Thrune government by completing
missions. These usually involve raids against important facilities controlled by
named villains. Success at these usually removes whatever capabilities that
villain brought into play, and gives the Silver Ravens control of the city
district they’re in. Districts under Raven control become safe from patrols and
such, and lower both current and maximum Authority by a certain amount (10 or 20
points, depending on the district). This is why I linked the Assassin’s Creed:
Brotherhood trailer above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thrune’s government tries to resist the rebellion through brutal reprisals
against the Ravens and the population in general. They can launch one such
reprisal per day for every 25 Authority or fraction thereof they have. Specific
reprisals are rolled out of a d100 table. The best possible result here is “No
Reprisal”, an organizational snafu that actually decreases Thrune’s
Authority. The other events result from mere defamation or increased patrols all
the way to a dragon air strike, each one increasing Authority by an amount
proportional to its badness. As Authority drops and named villains are killed,
some of these entries will be removed and replaced with No Reprisal. Can’t have
a dragon attack if the dragon is dead! Authority also increased by 1d6 at the
start of every day, to represent the population’s and the Ravens’ war weariness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with those reprisal events is that they also kill some of the city’s
population. While the chance that the PCs will lose the game at this stage is
small, they must act quickly and forcefully to prevent Thrune from doing too
much damage to the city they’re trying to protect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authority starts at 100 by default, but past Silver Raven victories in previous
adventures can reduce this starting amount. A “perfect run” means allying with
both the sea elves and Vyre; destroying Menador keep &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; stealing the
documents kept there; and finishing the Ruby Masquerade with 20 or more Masque
Points. This would mean Thrune starts this adventure with Authority at 65/100,
giving the PCs a major starting advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-missions&quot;&gt;The Missions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default expectation here is that the PCs managed to win the battle at the
opera house and fully explore it at the end of the last adventure. If this is
the case, the adventure starts with an emergency meeting of the Silver Council
taking place as soon as the PCs are recovered, to update them on the state of
the rebellion and explain the available district control missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If on the other hand the PCs &lt;em&gt;lost&lt;/em&gt; the opera house battle, they wake up in a
cell in Kintargo Keep, and must escape. They basically tackle the hardest
mission first, from the inside out, and then add the Opera House to their to-do
list later - it’s still full of stuff vital to their success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the missions consist of relatively short dungeon raids that are
essentially big set-piece battles against the villain of the hour and their
minions. These encounters tend to all be CR 13. This is where the game
introduces a new monster type, the Troop, which works a lot like a 4e Swarm but
occupies an area that’s more “malleable” than the standard square. There are
Dottari and Inquisitor troops here, representing the fact that Thrune’s security
forces are out in well, force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, PCs can order the Ravens to perform support actions before
every dungeon raid instead of just at the end of every week. If the named
villains in each one manage to survive and escape, they’ll likely join Thrune at
the Temple of Asmodeus. Even if this happens, they still count as defeated for
district-taking purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the mission list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rescue-hetamon-jarvis-end-district&quot;&gt;Rescue Hetamon (Jarvis End District)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hetamon Haace is the Rose of Kintargo. He became an ally and a member of the
Silver Council back in adventure 02, but is missing from this adventure’s
emergency meeting. Finding him is a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out he’s been kidnapped by his evil half-succubus sorceress of a mother,
who is holed up in the basement of Shensen’s former home and plans to sell him
to Thrune in exchange for some sort of cushy job or at least a license to hunt
people in Kintargo. She has a bevy of minions both voluntary and enslaved. The
former consist of a covey of hags; some of the latter can be freed instead of
fought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shensen can give the PCs the full layout of her own basement, of course. And if
she comes along the PCs might also recruit her best friend who is hiding in
there, a sapient dinosaur rogue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completing this one and reconsecrating the basement as a shrine to Sarenrae
gives PCs control of Jarvis End.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-the-records-hall-the-greens-district&quot;&gt;Take the Records Hall (The Greens District)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Records Hall is full of important information about the city and its
inhabitants, and denying this to Thrune will be a major blow to his forces. It’s
also the current lair of Tiarise Izoni, the witch responsible for most
atrocities of an arcane nature committed so far in the campaign. Opposition here
consists of the witch, two inquisitor troops, and two invisible stalkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiarise’s notes can give the PCs clues about Thrune’s ultimate plan for
immortality, and also alert them to the fact she has performed a ritual on
herself that will turn her into a powerful undead creature when she dies. Unless
she is killed under specific circumstances, Tiarise returns in the last
adventure in undead form as one of its named villains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bleakbridge-yolubilis-harbor-district&quot;&gt;Bleakbridge (Yolubilis Harbor District)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bridge is blockaded by a huge force of dottari (three troops, two captains,
a named commander). They’re being helped by a gang of tengu named the River
Talons, who are acting as lookouts. Fortunately, their alliance is shaky and the
Talons’ leader is the brother of Silver Council Member Chok (a weapon shop owner
who joins at the start of this adventure). If the PCs can arrange a meeting
between Chok and his brother, the latter can be convinced to betray the
dottari. In that case, the Talons will not raise the alarm when the PCs sneak
into the bridge, and will take care of one of the dottari troops “offscreen”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sneaking into the bridge is possible at all because it’s huge - there are
actually buildings on both sides, with plenty of space to cross in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skinsaw-assassins-villegre-or-redroof-districts&quot;&gt;Skinsaw Assassins (Villegre or Redroof Districts)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cultists are led by Hei-fen, the spiteful and vengeful wererat who has it
in for the PCs. The PCs are warned about them by Molly Mayapple, the helpful and
grateful wererat from Vyre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cultists will attack the PCs in three separate occasions, possibly while
they’re busy with something else. The first strike is six cultists, the second
one a jorogumo, and the final one another twelve cultists, another jorogumo, and
Hei-fen herself. They’re also doing murders for Thrune on the side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliminating all of them changes the corresponding reprisal table entry to “No
Reprisal”, and gives the city enough breathing room for the PCs to take control
of either Villegre or Redroof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kintargo-keep-castle-district&quot;&gt;Kintargo Keep (Castle District)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Thrune’s most important political prisoners are being kept. If the
PCs have been captured at the end of the last adventure, they start here and
must escape. Otherwise, this will probably be the last place they hit. The keep
and castle are much less guarded than usual because Barzilai ordered most of the
troops stationed here to go out and hunt for the PCs, which ironically lets them
approach the Keep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the tower has five levels, only the ground floor and basement are truly
relevant. When the PCs attack the tower is being guarded by six Hellknights of
the Rack and their leader, Paralictor Kyrre Ekodyre. The knights should spot the
PCs as soon as they make it past the door, so they will eventually need to deal
with all of them and the paralictor in the same fight. There are some undead
knights possessing suits of armor guarding a shrine, but they will not join the
main fight unless disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The keep’s archives contain the contracts Barzilai made with the order of the
Rack, to transfer all of the assets of the Order of the Torrent to them (back in
adventure 02). Turns out there are a lot of irregularities in these contracts
that make them illegal. The Hellknights, who are Lawful-Eviler-than-thou, will
abandon Thrune once these documents are made public. This will remove them from
all random and pre-arranged encounters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The archives also contain prisoner records showing that Jackdaw, the original
leader of the Silver Ravens, is still here! House Thrune’s redaction efforts
were so effective that not even Barzilai or the knights remember why she was
important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackdaw is being held in a special cell in the basement, behind a secret
door. She’s guarded by a being known as the First Warden, a former warpriest of
Asmodeus who was turned into a lich and bound to this prison as a punishment for
some forgotten transgression. The Warden will at first attempt to talk to the
PCs because it’s been a long time since she had a proper conversation, but will
attack when she realizes they’re here to free Jackdaw. She has a lot of priestly
abilities and the help of four more of those possessed armors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackdaw is in a pretty sorry state - the lich has kept her from dying, but
hasn’t done anything to make her comfortable. Once the PCs restore her health
and sanity, she becomes a very valuable ally. She can also supply them with the
lyrics for the Song of Silver, which combined with the score from the opera
house allows the PCs to use the ritual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dragon-villegre-or-redroof-district&quot;&gt;The Dragon (Villegre or Redroof District)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did mention a dragon, didn’t I? She’s an adult blue dragon named Rivozair. She
first attacked the city during the Chelish civil war, and was nearly killed by
the original Silver Ravens. Rivozair returned shortly before the campaign
started and agreed to join up with Barzilai for a chance to take revenge on the
city. He invested her with additional infernal power, binding her to a horned
devil in the same way Nox from Adventure 01 was bound to a bearded one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rivozair is a powerhouse of a solo boss, and one of Barzilai’s most powerful
minions. In addition to her usual “I’m a dragon!” suite of abilities, her
lightning breath has been replaced with hellfire, she can summon barbed devils,
and she has Regeneration 5 that can only be overcome by Good-aligned spells and
weapons (though that last bit shouldn’t be a problem at this point). After the
PCs finish the other five missions, or after they reduce Barzilai’s Authority to
0 (whatever happens first), the dragon will be unleashed to hunt down and kill
the PCs directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the GM wants to make this battle a bit easier, they can have some of the PC’s
allies help in the fight. If on the other hand they want to make it harder, they
can have the dragon begin its hunt earlier than scheduled. Rivozair will try to
become invisible and run away when she’s badly wounded, but instead of rallying
at the Temple she will flee the region. She might come back to disrupt the
victory celebration, if the GM wishes. Otherwise she will remove herself from
the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defeating Rovizair removes her entry from the reprisal table… but more
importantly it &lt;em&gt;instantly reduces Authority to 0&lt;/em&gt;. I guess any remaining minions
will see that the PCs can handle the dragon and will immediately leave their
posts as if they had been defeated, rallying at the Temple of Asmodeus. We now
enter the final stage of the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings this post to a close. There’s actually little I would cut from
this part of the adventure, since all of the fights here seem pretty cool. When
playing in Pathfinder, they are also quite amenable to alpha-strike tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post, we’ll take a look at the effects of the Song of Silver and at
the Temple of Asmodeus, which unlike these short raids is a huge grinding slog.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>GURPS is Brutalist, or Tweaking The Flow of Combat in GURPS</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/long-lines-building.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    The Long Lines Building in New York
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common complaint I hear about people who tried GURPS for the first time coming
in from other systems is that the “flow” of combat feels odd. Mainly that those
1-second turns are too short and don’t let you do enough. Sometimes also that
these short turns lead to fights that end too quickly to be dramatic&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this comes from a mismatch between the player’s learned expectations and
the way GURPS actually does things. In this post I’ll try to describe this
difference, and give a few suggestions on how to reduce the friction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;describing-the-difference&quot;&gt;Describing the Difference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with an example. You’re in a typical dungeon fantasy combat against
a bunch of zombies, playing an archer character. You make an attack, and
describe it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I draw and nock an arrow, then I take aim at the closest zombie and shoot! As
soon as the arrow flies, I’m already drawing another one from my quiver!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do other systems&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; usually handle this, and what does GURPS do that’s so
different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract-action-economies&quot;&gt;Abstract Action Economies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most tabletop RPG systems are fairly abstract when it comes to combat. To the
rules, it doesn’t matter what motions your PC is actually going through when
they perform an action, nor does it matter how long a turn lasts. It is enough
to know what the action is, and that a turn is long enough for you to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In systems that work this way, our archer’s narration is just a cool
embellishment that adds some fun detail to a standard ranged attack roll. All
the rules need to know is that it’s a ranged attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the choice of which actions perform in your turn matters a lot. You get
a certain number of them, all of which have an immediate effect in the current
turn but don’t influence future ones. Therefore the system’s incentives gently
push you to be maximally efficient on a turn-by-turn basis&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Attacks are good
because they bring the fight closer to an end. If you use your main action for
something else, it better bring as much benefit to you as attacking would, or
you have just “wasted” your turn. This set of mechanics and incentives is
usually called an “action economy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gurps-way&quot;&gt;The GURPS Way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where other systems are abstract, GURPS is so concrete it’s practically
brutalist. Turns last one second and its combat maneuvers are a lot more
fine-grained than combat actions in other games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Union of Generic Universal Republics our example description is not just
a bit of flavor: it’s a five-turn plan. Ready (draw arrow), Ready (nock arrow),
Aim, Attack, Ready (draw arrow)&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the actual blow from your weapon, press of the trigger, or release of the
bowstring counts as an Attack. The other stuff in the plan above are maneuvers
that make your Attack possible and set it up for success. In GURPS, you want to
increase the &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of your attacks, not necessarily their &lt;em&gt;quantity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the same reason GURPS is a bit less amenable to “needless embellishment”
than more abstract games. Combat goes much more smoothly when you keep your
action declarations to short sentences that map to a single maneuver. The
structure you build out of these simple blocks can end up looking every bit as
beautiful as the freeform narrative, though. This too, is brutalism.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;proposed-solutions&quot;&gt;Proposed Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The GURPS way” is neither better nor worse than the action economies of other
systems. It’s just different. But it’s different enough that it can trip up
people coming in from other games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the description above helped you smooth the friction between the rules and
your expectations, then great! But it’s likely that it didn’t, and you still
having trouble with it. In that case, here are a couple of suggestions on how to
make your experience smoother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solution-1-its-a-character-skill-issue&quot;&gt;Solution 1: It’s a (Character) Skill Issue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big reasons to use “setup” maneuvers like Evaluate, Feint, and Aim is
that your character’s skill level might not be high enough to give you a decent
chance of success. Without those maneuvers, you’ll end up missing more often, or
will have trouble getting past your enemy’s defenses. This is common at the core
books’ default 150 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to make attacking every turn more feasible and fun is to raise the power
level of your characters. This is the approach taken by Dungeon Fantasy and
Action: not only do they use 250 point templates, they optimize them a fair bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the physical combatant templates in DF start with 16 in their main combat
skill &lt;em&gt;at the very least&lt;/em&gt;. Many have a 18, and a couple either start with a 20
or can get there with a bit of point shuffling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might sound excessive at first glance. Your base chance of success doesn’t
increase past 16, and it’s unlikely anyone had more than a 18 in all of human
history. Why allow PCs to &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; there, and possibly go even higher with earned
points? Because this is what you need to be able to reliably attack every second
without taking the time to perform setup maneuvers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these “overpowered” skill levels you can absorb more penalties without
having to Evaluate or Aim to offset them, and you can use Deceptive Attacks
instead of Feints without affecting your chances of success. If you still have
enough spare skill levels left, you can even thrown in a Rapid Strike to make
two attacks in that second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;solution-2-mandatory-dramatic-pauses&quot;&gt;Solution 2: Mandatory Dramatic Pauses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighters in real-world combat sports and action movies don’t spend every second
of their fights furiously attacking each other. They’ll circle while looking for
openings, stop to catch their breaths, and only go in for an exchange of actual
blows every once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of setup maneuvers helps stretch fights out to be more similar to these
examples, but if you’re reading this it’s because you don’t think they’re a good
solution. And even if you do, you might want to go further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to do this is to crib from the rules for tournament fights in GURPS
Martial Arts. Under those rules, fights are composed of &lt;em&gt;lulls&lt;/em&gt; and
&lt;em&gt;flurries&lt;/em&gt;. Combatants can only use the Attack maneuver&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; during a
flurry. During a lull, they cannot attack but can still use maneuvers like
Change Posture, Evaluate, Move, Ready, Aim, or even just Do Nothing while
waiting for an opening. In fantasy settings it would be a good time to cast
those healing spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GURPS Martial Arts has flurries last for 2d seconds and lulls for 4d seconds,
rolled at the start of the corresponding period. You can tweak these durations
to best suit your campaign. If the combatants’ actions look like they’re going
to force an early change, you can end the current “period” early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of introducing lulls is to extend a fight’s in-character
duration to something like that of a real-world boxing or MMA round. They can
also help change the mental “efficiency” calculation of someone who’s used to
action economies. If there’s a part of the fight where you can’t attack,
performing setup actions for when you can becomes the most efficient thing to
do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lulls work both in melee and ranged combat (when everyone might hunker down
behind cover for a while), but they might get a bit hard to manage or look a bit
silly when you have a large number of combatants in a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;10 minutes to beat the bad guy and disarm the bomb is not a problem at all
if you beat the bad guy in 5 seconds. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Other Systems” here means the last three editions of D&amp;amp;D, Pathfinder 2E,
most editions of Shadowrun, and any others that might be similar in outlook
but which I’m not too familiar with. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And if there are any obsessive optimizers in your group, they’ll push you
much less gently. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I admit I tacked that extra Ready at the end to make the “five-second
plan” joke work. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And its cousin All-Out-Attack. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:5&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Abandoning Weapon Master</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back I made a post about &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2021/05/27/masterful-combat.html&quot;&gt;combining Weapon Master and Trained by a
Master&lt;/a&gt; into a single advantage. After thinking about it for a while, I think
I might have changed my mind about it. I not sure the two traits are really
meant to coexist in the same campaign, despite what Dungeon Fantasy tries to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dungeon Fantasy character creation rules are all about replicating a lot of
D&amp;amp;D’s conventions in GURPS. And one of the D&amp;amp;D-isms it tries to replicate is
that a combat centric character can be either strong or fast, but not both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dd-combat-conventions&quot;&gt;D&amp;amp;D Combat Conventions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent editions of D&amp;amp;D, that happens because characters have a very limited
number of points to distribute at creation, and every class is meant to have
only 1 or 2 attributes that are important to its abilities. Physical combatants
end up having either STR or DEX as their main attribute, and the rules are
usually set up so that the other member of the pair can be safely dumped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;STR-based combatants use the heaviest armor and weapons they can get. The vast
majority are melee specialists. Some buy a single thrown weapon at creation and
then promptly forget about it. All of these options are designed to make
Dexterity not matter to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DEX-based combatants are the opposite: they wear light or no armor, and are
evenly split between archers and melee skirmishers who rely on “finesse weapons”
that use DEX instead of STR. Therefore Strength doesn’t matter to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every physical combatant&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the last three editions of D&amp;amp;D is going to lean
heavily towards one of these archetypes. A few classes incentivise players to
try and be a bit of both, but for most of them that’s going to lead to a weaker
character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-gurps&quot;&gt;What about GURPS?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dungeon Fantasy gives you templates to emulate the classes from recent D&amp;amp;D, so
it ends up bringing this particular trope wholesale into GURPS. You have your
Strong Delvers, and your Fast Delvers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But we run into some issues because
GURPS is much less abstract than D&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both in real life and in GURPS, combatants want to be &lt;em&gt;both strong and
fast&lt;/em&gt;. You need speed and precision to hit, and you need to put some force
behind your blows for them to be effective. Sure, an individual character might
have ST or DX that’s a bit higher than the other, but they’ll never be 10+
points apart like they are in their D&amp;amp;D equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, DF tries, and Weapon Master is a significant component of this
attempt. It’s a mandatory trait for Swashbucklers, and an optional one for the
other fast delvers. It more or less takes the place of D&amp;amp;D’s Weapon Finesse,
since it allows these characters to do improved melee damage without investing
many points into ST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also an optional Knight trait. And it’s quite easy to take a starting
Knight and give them ST 18, Weapon Master (Dueling Halberd), and a starting
weapon skill of 20. Such a character literally combines the best of both
worlds. They can do all the same fancy tricks as the ST 11 Swashbuckler, and
their strikes to a massive amount of damage when they land, due to the higher
base number of damage dice and the per-die damage bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a player, this damage bonus seems so good to me that I’d feel bad about
“leaving it on the table” and not taking Weapon Master. As a GM, I worry that
any enemy that can withstand a hit from the Knight will be impervious to attacks
from the other PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do-about-it&quot;&gt;What to do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first option is of course to do nothing. This is admitedly a very niche
concern and you might be okay with it in your game. But if you are having Weapon
Master Problems at your table you might try one of these other possible
solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solution-1-flat-damage-bonus&quot;&gt;Solution 1: Flat Damage Bonus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “minimally invasive” solution is to change the damage bonus from +1 or +2 &lt;em&gt;per
die&lt;/em&gt; to a flat +1 or +2. All advantage costs remain the same, as do all
templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the skinny swashbuckler who rolls a single die for damage still
gets the same bonus. Meanwhile Mister Halberd with his three dice of swing
damage gets a much smaller relative benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solution-2-no-more-weapon-master&quot;&gt;Solution 2: No More Weapon Master!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapon Master no longer exists and Trained By a Master comes in categories
similar to the removed advantage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;20 points makes you trained in One Weapon. This gives you improved parries,
improved Rapid Strikes, and access to the same limited set of Chi Skills as
Weapon Master did. No damage bonus, though!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;25 points gives you the same benefits for Two Related Weapons or all weapons
covered by One Skill.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;30 points works as printed, giving you the full set of Trained By a Master
benefits for all muscle-powered weapons and unarmed attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“All knives” counts as a single weapon for these purposes, like in the books. So
do “all unarmed attacks”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone who had Weapon Master as an optional advantage gets the corresponding
version of Trained by a Master instead, and has the option to upgrade to the
full version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a more drastic and slightly more complicated solution. No one gets a
damage bonus any more, but no one overpays for the full Weapon Master package
either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And then you have spellcasters, who choose to be slow and weak so they can
be good at magic. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And Smart Delvers, for which see Footnote 1. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
