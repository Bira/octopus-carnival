&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2021/03/06/spaceplane.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we used GURPS Spaceships rules to build a “minimum
viable spaceplane” at TL8, with no superscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our company, Octopus Aerospace, builds one of those and sells it to the
Kerbal Space Program for close to a billion GURPS dollars&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and after using
it for a few launches Director Kerbman comes back to us with a few change
requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His astronauts have complained that the Mark I Spaceplane handles very poorly
for its size. They’re entering a phase of their program where future missions
will require a lot of precise orbital maneuvers, like docking and such, so they
need a ship that can do better at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to satisfy KSP’s requests because we want a slice of their inifinte
budget, but we’re also committed to making only Single Stage To Orbit craft. How
can we satisfy both of these requirements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-the-mark-ii&quot;&gt;Building the Mark II&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re still using “realistic” TL 8 for our Mark II, and it’s still streamlined
and winged just like its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw in our previous post, a TL8 craft capable of reaching orbit can only
spare 10% of its mass to systems that are not fuel tanks or chemical engines. We
achieved that in the Mark I by shrinking our control systems and cargo bay,
filling the freed space with additional fuel tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want a full size control system for the second iteration, but having that
means we’ll be short on delta-V and can’t make an orbital insertion. We have to
shrink something else to compensate. We’re already shrunk the cargo bay, and I
don’t want to shrink the armor because I’m envisioning as the craft’s heat
shield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about the engine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our resulting configuration is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 x Metallic Laminate Armor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 x SM +8 control room&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 x 15-ton cargo bay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;17.33 x Fuel Tanks (865 tons rocket fuel)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 x SM +7 Chemical Rocket Engine (1G Acceleration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One lone G of acceleration is useless for leaving Earth… in a traditional
rocket. We have wings! According to GURPS Spaceships p. 37, a winged craft can
take off and reach Earth orbit even if its acceleration doesn’t exceed 1G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with the following stat line for our Mark II space plane:
&lt;strong&gt;dST/dHP&lt;/strong&gt; 70; &lt;strong&gt;Air Hnd/SR&lt;/strong&gt; +3/4; &lt;strong&gt;Space Hnd/SR&lt;/strong&gt; -2/4; &lt;strong&gt;Move&lt;/strong&gt; 1G/6.05mps;
&lt;strong&gt;LWt&lt;/strong&gt; 1000; &lt;strong&gt;Load&lt;/strong&gt; 15.3; &lt;strong&gt;SM&lt;/strong&gt; +8; &lt;strong&gt;Occ&lt;/strong&gt; 4; &lt;strong&gt;dDR&lt;/strong&gt; 0/2/0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model’s Air Handling and Stability is pretty awesome when compared to that
of most contemporary airplanes. Its space handling is still not exactly
spectacular, but it’s the best we can do for a ship of this size at TL 8, and
should help with those delicate maneuvers. It takes longer to reach orbit due to
its lower acceleration, but it still has the same Delta-V. Finally, it has space
for one additional crew member, allowing KSP to bring extra scientists or other
mission specialists along with the payload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheaper engine and more expensive control room balance themselves out. The
Mark II costs the same as the Mark I: a nominal $8.8M for the craft and $693,200
for a full load of rocket fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-notessales-pitch&quot;&gt;Bonus Notes/Sales Pitch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is something I forgot to mention in the previous post: both the Mark I and
Mark II Octopus Carnival Spaceplanes can take off from conventional runways,
dispensing with the need for an expensive launch pad!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mark I would probably require a launchpad if you want to use those 3Gs of
acceleration right away, but if I remember correctly liquid fuel engines can be
throttled. So you can take off using a jet-engine-equivalent 1G and throttle up
when you reach a higher altitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when you multiply their nominal cost by 100 for the extremely limited
production run, you still end up with a cost-effective system. SpaceX’s
semi-reusable rockets cost between $50M and $150M &lt;em&gt;per launch&lt;/em&gt;. The real-world
Space Shuttle cost between $500M and $1.5B per launch. The Saturn V cost about
$1.6B per launch in modern dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our fictional spaceplane would cost little more than the cost of a load of
fuel. Sure, it’d need to undergo maintenance between flights, but it probably
wouldn’t need to be practically rebuilt like the real-world systems. So perhaps
we’re looking at $2M per launch or so? It practically pays for itself in six
launches or so when compared to the “competition”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that’s a very optimistic assumption. In your games you’re always free
to assume Octopus Aerospace is full of shit and this thing is a lemon in all its
incarnations. It’s what prevented all those real world spaceplane projects from
going forward, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;$880M, or its nominal cost multiplied by 100 because it’s a production
run of one. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been reading about Kerbal Space Program recently, and it made me want to
try my hand at designing some GURPS spaceships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the terms that often gets thrown about when talking about near-future
space tech is “Single Stage to Orbit”, or SSTO. This would be a vehicle that can
go from ground to orbit all by itself, without needing any detachable
boosters. In the real world, a lot of plans for building one of these have been
conceived and dropped, but we don’t have a real example yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How close does GURPS Spaceships think we are to such a thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I’ll try to design a spaceplane, a popular type of theoretical SSTO
craft. The basic idea is that they take off and fly to the upper atmosphere
using air-breathing engines, and only then activate their rockets to reach
orbit. After completing their mission, they can re-enter atmosphere and land by
gliding. Spaceplanes are an attractive concept because they can use a lot less
fuel to reach orbit, are fully reusable, and easier to maintain. Plus they tend
to look really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mission-statement-and-design-options&quot;&gt;Mission Statement and Design Options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this attempt, we’re going to assume a realistic TL8 setting (“present-day
technology”), giving us access to TL7 and 8 items from the book. I’ll
arbitrarily assign it SM +8, making it a 1000 ton craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, our craft is SM +8, TL8, streamlined, and winged. It must take off
from the ground on Earth and reach orbital velocity using without the aid of
external boosters or detachable stages, while carrying a multi-ton payload in
its cargo hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means it must have a total delta-V exceeding 5.6 miles per second after all
the calculations are done&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. We get a bonus 0.3 mps if we launch eastwards
from the equator, but having the craft reach the number on its own would allow
it to launch from anywhere in the planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fixed-systems&quot;&gt;Fixed Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design options above lock down 3 of the 20 systems we have available:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need 1 armor system because we’re streamlined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need a control room (1 system).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need a cargo bay (1 system).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes in this post it doesn’t matter what the armor is made of, but
we might as well use Metallic Laminate since we’re designing a “cutting edge”
craft. The remaining 17 systems will be split among engines and fuel tanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our TL, we have two engine options: the Chemical Rocket and the Jet
Engine. They both help, but use different fuel sources. Adding jet engines means
we need to figure out their top airspeed and subtract that from the necessary
delta-V to reach orbit. Rocket delta-V is purely a function of how many tanks we
dedicate to rocket fuel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attempt-1-mixing-rockets-and-jet-engines&quot;&gt;Attempt 1: Mixing Rockets and Jet Engines.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first draft had the following configuration for our 17 “free” systems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 Jet Engines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 Chemical Rocket Engine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;14 Fuel Tanks (13 for rocket fuel, 1 for jet fuel).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jet fuel allowed us to run the jets for half an hour, which was more than
enough to reach maximum speed and altitude. They lowered our target to 4.63 mps,
but that’s not enough. Combining the rules for chemical rockets and fuel tanks,
our rocket had 3.12 mps of delta-V available to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be good for a fancy passenger plane for people with money to burn,
but not for a SSTO vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attempt-2-rocket-plane&quot;&gt;Attempt 2: Rocket Plane&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we build an all-rocket engine assembly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 Chemical Rocket Engine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;16 fuel tanks (all rocket fuel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding up the delta-V for this version is easier, and we do end up with more of
it, but it’s still not enough. We get 4.8 out of 5.6 mps. So close, yet so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this configuration gives us is a reusable &lt;em&gt;launch-assist vehicle&lt;/em&gt; can get
its 50-ton payload &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; to orbital speeds. The payload itself would need to
be another vehicle that could provide the remaining 0.8 mps of delta-V itself,
and perhaps include a bit more for maneuvers once in orbit. The LAV can spend
all of its own fuel and glide down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attempt-3-cheating-with-optional-rules&quot;&gt;Attempt 3: Cheating with Optional Rules.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve run up against one of the harsh realities of the Spaceships design
rules. Using only TL7-8 chemical rockets, you simply can’t make an orbit-capable
vehicle with less than 17 fuel tanks. A traditional disposable rocket can be
modeled with 1 chemical rocket system, 17 fuel tanks, and an upper stage with an
SM 2 smaller than the rocket itself. This upper stage has the armor needed by a
streamlined craft, and the discarded lower stage burns up on re-entry. Our
spaceplane faces some trouble because it needs to include that armor system
itself, leaving us 1 fuel tank short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way we can make it work is by pulling in an optional rule from GURPS
Spaceships 7 p. 4: Smaller Systems. By shrinking both our cargo bay and control
room to SM +7, we decrease our cargo capacity to 15 tons, decrease our
Handling/SR in by 1, and add 1.33 fuel tanks to our all-rocket spaceplane. That
gets us 6.05 mps of delta-V, enough to launch from anywhere on the planet and
still leave us some reserves for maneuvers and corrections. It carries less than
the equivalent disposable rocket but is fully reusable, able to land by gliding
even with an empty fuel tank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We leave the armor system at the same size because it’s meant to serve as a heat
shield on re-entry, so it’s probably placed in the central hull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing we just designed is remarkably similar to the Lockheed-Martin
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VentureStar&quot;&gt;VentureStar&lt;/a&gt;, at least if the stats in the Wikipedia article are to be
believed. This is a project for a SSTO spaceplane whose most famous product is
the X-33 prototype, a scaled-down version of the final design intended to test
some of its technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VentureStar was supposed to be a lot simpler to maintain than the space shuttle,
and was intended to be available for sale to private companies and not just to
NASA, kick-starting a wave of private space exploration. The project was
cancelled in 2001 because its fuel tanks were too hard to manufacture using the
technology of the time. Ironically, better manufacturing techniques were
discovered a few years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from having to contend with the “harsh truth” of the design rules we
already mentioned, our spaceplane also illustrates what seems to be a constraint
plaguing real-world designers: separate air-breathing and rocket engines are
inefficient. Go rocket-only or get you an engine that can do both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its final stats are: dST/dHP 70; Air Hnd/SR +2/3; Space Hnd/SR -3/3; Move
3G/6.05mps; LWt. 1000; Load 15.3; SM+8; Occ 3; dDR 0/2/0. The Space handling is
terrible, but workable when the mission is “get up, release the payload, get
down”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our spaceplane costs $8.8M according to the design rules. Of course, that’s its
price if it was mass-produced and commercially available. The rather more
bespoke space program manufacturing model means it could cost up to 100 times
more. It runs on liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen rocket fuel, a full load of which
costs $693,200.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LAV version has better handling and stability (+3/4 in air and -2/4 in
space) and costs about $40K less to fuel, and can deliver a bigger payload as
long as that payload has some delta-V of its own. But it’s not a spaceplane, so
nyeh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I like using a proper measurement system, but all of the book’s formulas
are in miles, so I’ll have to use that to avoid getting confused during the
design process. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>How I Started Role-Playing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lich van Winkle has &lt;a href=&quot;https://lichvanwinkle.blogspot.com/2021/01/how-you-started.html&quot;&gt;a post in his blog&lt;/a&gt; where asks people how they started
role-playing. I figured I’d answer that here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I start, it’s worth noting that I’m Brazilian, so my story is going to be
a bit different than that of most people reading this blog. I also grew up in
the state of Mato Grosso, which in the 80’s and 90’s meant “far out in the
boonies” as far as RPGs were concerned. Most of my acquisitions happened during
trips to visit family in Curitiba, a bigger city in another state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The year you began, and with which role-playing game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you figure it out alone, or were you introduced by a lone but
experienced GM, or by joining a preexisting group?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first contact with the concept of role-playing games actually happened
through Choose Your Own Adventure books. Y’know, those books that had a couple
hundred numbered sections and directed you to different numbers based on your
decisions. There were a bunch of those in my school library, which was a small
miracle since that library only had like four bookshelves. This was 1991 or so,
which means I was 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on I’d convince my parents to buy me similar books - my first Fighting
Fantasy titles, in their Brazilian editions. These were more complex, with an
actual character sheet and die rolling. I remember this book from some other
series, where you played Robin Hood, and which had a combat system complex
enough to rival AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first actual RPG experience was around 1994, with a version of Basic D&amp;amp;D that
was translated by a company named Grow, and packaged as a board game. I think it
might have been a boxed set as well in the US - it was the one with Zanzer Tem’s
dungeon on it, and had rules for PCs of up to level 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that I got into GMing, and my games of choice were Tagmar (a
Brazilian-made fantasy game) and later a very badly translated Shadowrun 2nd
Edition. I also got familiar with GURPS and Storyteller at around this time,
though I didn’t play them regularly. In 1996 I went on a one-month student
exchange trip to the UK, and came back with a backpack full of Shadowrun
supplements in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your first group like? Was it private among friends, in a game
store, or in a club? Were they older, younger than you? Did their style of
play shape the way you played later?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group was my brother and a couple of other friends. Almost everyone was
around the same age as me (except for my brother, who was a bit younger). We
usually played at my home, and I’d say my style of play shaped theirs more
than the other way around, since I was always the GM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I was the only one out of that bunch who kept being a part of the
hobby once we split, though. Dunno if that speaks well or badly of my GMing
skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your favorite role-playing game. (Was it the game you started with?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s GURPS, and it’s not the one I started with. Lately I’ve also taken a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;huge liking to Lancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anything else you want to share reflecting the impact of how you started on
how you play(ed).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being from a different country and having ready access to a very small
pool of games when compared to someone from the US, my experience bears some
striking similarities with Lich van Winkle’s in that D&amp;amp;D was a very small part
of my formative experience. I remember finding its many arbitrary limitations
very confining, so I spent most of my time in other games that didn’t have
them. Though some of those limitations have been removed, a lot of them still
remain in the game’s latest edition.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are Mecha Silly?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I saw someone start a thread on the RPG.net forum, with the title “Why
are mecha silly?”. The person in question was of the opinion that not only were
mecha not silly, they were &lt;em&gt;plausible&lt;/em&gt;, and went on to list reasons they thought
so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, all of those were swiftly debunked by posters, but I think the thread
kinda got away from the main point after a while. So I thought I’d write a bit
about this subject here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thread’s title had a bit of an unfortunate framing, because it started from
the premise that mecha &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; silly even though its opening poster didn’t think
so. A better question to ask might be “Are Mecha Silly?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My answer is somewhat nuanced, but it can still be summed up as “No”. Giant
robots are definitely &lt;em&gt;cinematic&lt;/em&gt;, but they’re not inherently sillier than any
other cinematic trope. It’s all about the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m using “mech” and “mecha” here to mean a humanoid (or at least legged)
piloted machine that’s used in about the same role as an armored fighting
vehicle or tank. Non-combat versions are usually used as heavy construction
equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are some of the traditional excuses for mecha: Legs make them able to
handle any terrain type better than wheels or threads. A humanoid form makes
them more agile and versatile than traditional vehicles. Something about the
specific technology used to build them makes them better weapons than
traditional vehicles (this last one varies per setting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these would hold up under scrutiny under a strictly realistic
setting. While some people are building smaller autonomous robots and
experimenting with load-bearing skeletons, building a giant mech is still far
beyond us and the general consensus on that seems to be that it’s not worth the
effort. Better to work at improving the specialized vehicles we know than
worrying about leg movement and the ground pressure exerted by two giant metal
feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you get more cinematic mecha become a better fit. An “action movie setting”
that makes you accept some people do the impossible because they’re just that
badass shouldn’t have a lot of trouble selling the idea that sometimes tanks
have legs. Full Metal Panic in its more serious moments is a good example of
this. The show itself is silly most of the time, but the robot fights are trated
in a more serious cinematic manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science fictional settings have more leeway than contemporary ones, because the
same classical excuses are still valid and it’s easier to assume that the
practical engineering concerns have been solved in the future. A lot of the
Gundam shows are in this territory, as are many other similar franchises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s just the shows that even bother to offer up excuses! You see, there
are two main “sub-genres” of mecha shows. The ones that bother to think about
excuses and to insert their mecha into a wider military context are called “Real
Robot” shows. The original Mobile Suit Gundam back in 1979 was the first of
these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of the coin are “Super Robot” shows, who don’t even bother with
that. Sometimes a 12-year old kid just inherits a fifteen story tall robot from
his dad, and flies that robot out of the secret hangar at the bottom of his
swimming pool to fight space monsters. Super Robot shows date from the early
seventies, and their overall aesthetic is closer to that of a gold or silver age
supers story than “proper” science fiction. They require the same kind of
suspension of disbelief. If you can accept Superman, you can accept Mazinger Z.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether Real or Super, no type of mecha is inherently silly as long as you place
it in the type of story it was meant to go in. Just like any other cinematic
trope.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Stormtrooper Armor Conundrum</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you know what is the second hardest thing to convert when adapting Star Wars
to the tabletop? Stormtroopers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. From an in-character perspective they vastly
outnumber and outgun the scrappy rebel protagonists, with deadly blaster
carbines and that iconic heavy armor. Yet in the actual narrative they almost
never hit a shot and always get taken out in one hit from one of the heroes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their poor aim has actually made it into GURPS as an optional cinematic rule
named “Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy”, which reduces the deadliness
of enemy shooters. But the armor thing has tied people’s brain in knots, because
it can’t be explained away with a joke. Why does their armor do nothing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are almost as many explanations and solutions to this as there are Star
Wars adaptations. Some say “all armor is bad, actually” and have PCs rely on
plot protection. Some have an armor system but go out of their way to explain
why trooper suits specifically are actually bad. And some have an armor system
that rates trooper armor highly but then go on to state that fun shootouts from
the movies are lies and legends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me, I think I hit on a solution that allows me to keep those fun fights while
still having armor be cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;imperial-stormtrooper-armor-drills&quot;&gt;Imperial Stormtrooper Armor Drills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a cinematic rule meant for science fiction settings where highly
effective armor is common, but you want the PCs to have fun battles against
armies of heavily-armored mooks. Star Wars and stormtroopers are the most
obvious examples, but it also works for settings such as Waframe’s with its
Grineer soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under this rule, armor worn by “mook” or “fodder” enemies has no protective
value, and is mostly a cosmetic detail! Any solid hit will take them down,
regardless of whether it would have penetrated their DR under standard
rules. Armor worn by PCs and other important characters still uses all the
default rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows you to frame a particularly badass trooper as a real threat and have
them survive several attacks without giving them different protective gear. It
also allows PCs to loot armor from a fallen mook and have it actually provide
benefit beyond a temporary disguise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optionally, you could perhaps take this a bit further and subject certain
stormtroopers to the Inverse Ninja Rule. See a full platoon of troopers gunning
for you? Easy. See &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; trooper approaching? Danger!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The first is the Force, but we all know that. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>The Great Irony At the Heart of Shadowrun</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For a very long time Shadowrun was my favorite game system and setting. These
days I still like the setting, but my annoyance at a host of small details in it
is stronger than my wish to play in it as written. Still, it’s useful to think
and talk about these details. It allows me to figure out what I want to do
better in my eventual home-brewed rewrite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these details isn’t small at all, however. In fact, I’d go as far as
calling it the great irony at the heart of the game, as the title of this post
implied. It was developed from some forum posts I made on RPG.net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-first-the-good-parts&quot;&gt;But First, The Good Parts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to be unfairly critical of Shadowrun&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. I know a few people who
write for it, and the last thing I want is to give the impression that I’m
attacking them. I’m not. This entire article is my personal opinion and in no
way meant to disparage any of the fine people who are passionate enough about
Shadowrun to write for it professionally. So let’s begin by talking about
something that this game does &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about the setting design of Shadowrun is that it presents
players with a very clear mission-based structure. The infamous question of “But
what do we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; in this world?” is answered very early and very clearly. This is
a game about completing dangerous missions for money, just like D&amp;amp;D is about
killing monsters and looting dungeons. Someone asks you to play Shadowrun, 99
times out of 100 you know the rough overall shape that campaign is going to
take. You see a heist movie and you start thinking about it in the context of
Shadowrun in your head, even if it doesn’t have all the same style elements,
because the premise is strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadowrun nailed the answer to this important question so well that it kinda
spilled over to other similar games. It became the default playstile for
Cyberpunk 2020 against the wishes of its own authors, and it often gets adopted
as the answer to “what do we do” in Transhuman Space&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which is so adamant
about offering none in its pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of Shadowrun setting elements, though, this structure has an
excellent &lt;em&gt;premise&lt;/em&gt; but its implementation gives rise to a lot of unintentional
oddness. Or, in this case, to a Great Irony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This irony, I think, emerges when the strong premise above gets combined with
AD&amp;amp;D-style adversarial GMing, which was very popular when Shadowrun was first
written. I believe it to be entirely unintentional, since as far as I can tell
Shadowrun’s design methodology was mostly based on the Rule of Cool with a dash
of “everyone else does this”. If it’s intentional, though, it’s among the
greatest acts of trolling in all of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;isnt-it-ironic&quot;&gt;Isn’t it Ironic?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so the Sixth World is ruled by megacorporations who control every aspect
of people’s lives. Most of these people live hand-to-mouth and work themselves
to death in order to prop up the decadent lifestyles of a few billionaire
executives. “Wage slave” is pretty much a synonym for “low-level megacorporate
employee” in this setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as the flavor text tells us, player characters are supposed to have managed
to escape this cycle of misery. They live in the shadows cast by those giant
corporate towers, and they have the skills to oppose the megacorps and make
their independent way in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or do they?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit I don’t know how things are structured in the most recent
editions&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but I remember that the Shadowrun Companion for Second Edition
contained detailed advice on how much money your PCs should be paid for those
risky missions.  I call it the “rent plus change” model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the book, GMs should pay PCs enough for them to cover their
lifestyle payments (i.e, rent and food) for the next month, with a little bit
left over for resupplying consumables and eventually upgrading a piece of gear
after a while. This was &lt;em&gt;per month&lt;/em&gt;, not per run. If you had only one big run
that month, it would pay this amount. If you had several, they would pay
proportionally less so you’d receive the same “rent plus change” amount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was perfectly in-keeping with the AD&amp;amp;D school of GMing and design, which
demanded PCs “earn” their power and had cool gear that cost money as a
significant part of that power. If they earn “too much” money, they would get
“too powerful”, and no one wants that! If your players look like they do, it’s
because they’re cheating cheaters who cheat and should be punished for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all published adventures started with a scene where the party met with
Mr. Johnson to discuss the job. In the vast majority of these adventures,
Mr. Johnson is a shady corporate exec working for one of the megas. And the GM
text for this scene always included the oh-so-funny “If the players refuse the
job, announce that the adventure ended, pack up your things and go home.” This
is a joke about how the PCs don’t have any choice but to take the job as
presented. In fact, the flavor text for the same scene almost always assumes
they’re hurting for cash just before they get that call from their contact
setting up the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, those fiercely independent PC shadowrunners? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;They’re all wage slaves
too&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. And the game advises the GM to keep them that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were the original writers oblivious to these implications, or are they still
laughing today about how no one seems to have noticed? I don’t think I have seen
any official discussion about this contradiction in any of the books I’ve
read. It’s just taken as a given, and never questioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This central irony gets funnier when you add in two sets of rules that were
published in the same edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;orichalcum&quot;&gt;Orichalcum&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early SR2 sourcebook called The Grimoire contained rules for making magic
items. It required a lot of skill tests and time, and the materials were still
super-expensive, but the final monetary cost was cheaper than buying the item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do you buy or make your items?” would have been mostly a question of personal
preference… if the book didn’t also have rules for making those materials from
raw natural resources. You could use them for enchanting or sell them for half
list price. You could even make orichalcum, the magical metal used in the
creation of the most powerful magic items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orichalcum was so expensive that a single 10-gram “unit” cost the same as a
sports car or as almost nine months of High Lifestyle. The process for making it
was time consuming and laborious, but not really dangerous or illegal. And a
skilled character could end up with multiple units of orichalcum at the end of
that process. Selling even a single unit would more than pay the cost of the
necessary equipment, which was reusable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these rules, a team of PCs that includes at least one magician has no
financial reason to run the shadows. They can just set up an orichalcum-making
operation instead, and live like kings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stolen-cars&quot;&gt;Stolen Cars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shadowrun Companion sourcebook includes rules for stealing cars and selling
them on the black market, which theoretically were meant to be used in a
campaign where the characters were gangers instead of Shadowrunners. You could
sell an entire stolen car for a fraction of its market value, or break it down
for parts and sell those over several days and get money equal to the car’s full
list price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stealing cars is of course illegal and dangerous, but it was trivial for the
typical PC party in this game. After all they have the skills to routinely break
into top-secret research labs full of intricate and deadly security measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheapest four-wheeled vehicle in the book was the Ford Americar, your
typical “generic crummy sedan” that filled every street. Stealing and
dismantling one of those every week would pay roughly five times the amount
recommended in the “rent plus change” advice in &lt;em&gt;the very same book&lt;/em&gt;. Or perhaps
you could steal one limousine or fancy sports car per quarter. In either case,
it was again much safer and more profitable than running the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shadowrun--irony--awesome&quot;&gt;Shadowrun + Irony = Awesome&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these two “oopsies” were first discovered, I remember seeing a lot of GMs
go absolutely ballistic over them. The accusations of “munchkinism” flew thick
and fast, but in true those GMs were mad that the PCs were doing something that
wasn’t in the script. They reveled in describing the disproportionate response
law enforcement or competitors would visit upon the PCs, which was just an
excuse to punish the players for veering off the rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think these two altertane activities are fraggin’ awesome,
precisely because they allow the party to truly break free from the grind. If
your players decide to retire from shadowrunning and make orichalcum or boost
cars for a living, I fully believe that the right response is to play along and
make the campaign be about that! All of those things mentioned as hard blocks by
curmudgeonly controlling GMs are actually excellent adventure hooks. And I’m
pretty sure any decent player group is going to keep finding non-monetary
reasons to return to the shadows. There’s still people to help and megacorps to
destroy, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I say that the first thing a team of shadowrunners needs to do is to find a
way to leave classic shadowrunning behind for good. It’s a sucker’s game. Stay
independent, take care of your community, tear down the system, make the Sixth
World better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Which already makes me nicer than most of the people who proclaim
  themselves its true fans. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Though THS PCs tend to be working for government agencies or corporations
  rather than being freelance criminals. This is, after all, &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2019/11/06/on-transhuman-space.html&quot;&gt;a cyberpunk setting
  as viewed by the bad guys&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I stopped at the end of Fourth. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Cyberpunk and Plagues</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;preface&quot;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been sitting on this one for a while now. I’m not gonna lie, writing and
publishing those Monster Manual posts is quite soothing. Particularly the
releasing part, which is just a few mechanical actions now that I have so much
pre-written material for it. Every once in a while I’ll sit and write something
that’s on my mind, and hesitate a bit before posting it. This is one such post,
which I’d say was written somewhere around late April or early May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-post&quot;&gt;The Post&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the outtakes from &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2019/11/16/on-transhuman-space.html&quot;&gt;my last screed against Transhuman Space&lt;/a&gt; was a
rebuttal to the bit where it says it’s better and more realistic than cyberpunk
because it doesn’t have any apocalyptic disasters in its Very Serious history of
the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had had whole paragraphs mapped out in my mind about how yes, the insistence
of 90’s cyberpunk RPGs in inserting these catastrophes was kinda silly. About
how they probably had their roots in their authors believing in that “end of
history” bullshit just as hard as the text of Transhuman Space itself did, and
how they couldn’t see the future being a shitty place if there wasn’t a plague,
a nuclear meltdown, or a big war somewhere in there to muck things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was going to end with an assertion that no, you don’t need a big, clear,
forced disaster to head down a bad path. A lot of those cyberpunk tropes (evil
corporations, authoritarian governments disguised as democracies, and so on)
happened all on their own without needing such a push. William Gibson’s concept
of the Jackpot, presented in his novel &lt;em&gt;The Peripheral&lt;/em&gt;, encapsulates all of
this a lot better than Transhuman Space’s bright future. Well, he is William
friggin’ Gibson, and he had almost twenty extra years of history to look at, but
still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That post is all ruined now, of course, because it turns out those
disaster-licious 90’s games were on to something after all. Here we are, amid a
deadly pandemic that’s causing an untold number of tragedies and turning whole
societies upside-down as enforced quarantines and lockdowns push them to change
their habits in a rush. It’s not nearly as bad as a genuine 90’s RPG disaster,
but, in true Jackpot fashion, it doesn’t have to be. It’s not the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of the
evil corps’ and authoritarian governments’ rise to power, but a &lt;em&gt;consequence&lt;/em&gt; of
it. And I don’t think either THS or the 90’s games would ever have predicted
that rich capitalists would, when faced with a plague, suggest that it was OK to
let vast numbers of people die from it as long as it kept the economy
growing. THS has far too much faith in its Very Smart Neoliberals to suggest
such a thing, and it sounds too bleak even for a 90’s-style dystopia.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dungeoncrawl Procedures at Nature Kills</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I published a post on “&lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/01/24/old-school-movement.html&quot;&gt;Old School Movement&lt;/a&gt;” with a simple
set of rules I could use when GMing converted old-school D&amp;amp;D and AD&amp;amp;D dungeons
in Dungeon Fantasy. Recently, the Nature Kills blog has also published &lt;a href=&quot;https://gurpshexytime.blogspot.com/2020/06/dungeoncrawl-procedures.html&quot;&gt;their
own take&lt;/a&gt; on the same subject in a post titled “Dungeoncrawl Procedures”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find most interesting on that post, and on the sources it links, is that
they see the lack of this detailed procedure in recent D&amp;amp;D editions as a grave
omission in that system. Having a canonical procedure to crawl a dungeon or to
perform any other sort of exploration is a vital pre-requisite for properly
designing these dungeons and other places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual procedure outlined there is similar to mine in nature, but differs in
some details and adds others I didn’t cover. The ones I found most interesting
are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This procedure should apply to all dungeon exploration, not just to AD&amp;amp;D
adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Default movement speed is double what I guessed (encumbered Move x 20m per
turn).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Traps are only sprung 2 out of 6 times. A direct translation of an old-school
mechanic that’s perfect for use when you’re not constantly using a map and
miniatures.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have convinced me to apply this mechanic to all dungeon crawls, but I
disagree with enough of their details that I feel I have to revise my own
procedure. That will happen some other time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Alternative Dungeon Fantasy Reward Systems</title>

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a lot of players, a big part of the fun of playing in the Dungeon Fantasy
genre comes from the rewards their characters acquire in play. And these in
turn fall into two main categories: treasure and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In GURPS, “experience” means Character Points, which are usually obtained for
successfully completing adventure goals and can be directly used to improve
characters. “Treasure” in a Dungeon Fantasy context can be split into magic
items and “monetary” treasure (i.e, coins and stuff you end up selling in town).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default these two reward types are mostly unrelated. Going by the experience
rewards scheme on p. 92 of DF: Exploits, a party could enter a dungeon, win lots
of battles, find a secret area or three, and win plenty of experience even if
they never find a single coin’s worth of treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the exact nature of your campaign, you might want to mess with
this reward scheme. Here are two possible ways to do that. In both, magic items
remain pretty much as written, but a stronger relationship is established
between experience and monetary treasure. They replace the standard system from
DF: Exploits entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;old-school-money-is-experience&quot;&gt;Old School: Money Is Experience&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the party returns to town, add up the total value in $ of all the monetary
treasure they acquired. As usual, coins contribute their full value. Other items
contribute their sale value, but only if the PCs sell them. Those items they
decide to keep should be excluded from this calculation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This total should be divided among the PCs. If your party is an anarchist
commune that keeps all money in a collective pile (like mine are!), then assume
an equal split for experience purposes. Most other parties probably also split
their take evenly, though if they’re really into that old-school vibe they might
have a complicated scheme set up that includes henchmen with half-shares,
seniority bonuses, and thieves who steal from the other PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCs who survived the process of splitting the loot get to earn XP from
it. Divide each PC’s share by $500: that’s how many points they get. This is the
exact same exchange rate they’d get from converting character points to money
during character creation. Depending on how much treasure your adventures
feature, you might want to adjust the rate! For example, a PC in a campaign that
follows &lt;a href=&quot;https://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com/2020/05/nearly-complete-thoughts-on-10x-cost.html&quot;&gt;Petter V. Del’Orto’s suggested house rule&lt;/a&gt; would earn one point for
every $5000 they earned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: Let’s say we have a party of 5 PCs that agree to split their loot
evenly. They meet a dragon shortly after they enter a dungeon, and are forced to
retreat having only found a small coin stash worth $1500. That comes out to $300
per PC, which is not enough for them to earn any points from this delve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCs prepare themselves better and try again, and this time they’re able to
kill the dragon and loot its hoard, which contains $25000 in monetary treasure
and several magic items. The magic items don’t enter into this calculation, so
each PC ends up with $5000 and earns 10 character points from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dungeon-souls-experience-is-money&quot;&gt;Dungeon Souls: Experience is Money&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some campaigns take place in settings where money is worthless. One example is
the Havens and Hells setting presented in Pyramid #3/89. Another is the Dark
Souls franchise. This alternate system is inspired by the latter, taking the
usual “battle experience” mechanics and making them into an in-character
concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The metaphysics of the world are such that when you defeat a monster in battle,
you siphon off a little of its life force! Depending on the setting this might
require killing the monster, but it could also involve simply defeating it in
combat and performing a small ritual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, people in the setting can use this accumulated “soul energy” for
all sorts of purposes, and it can be voluntarily transferred. So it becomes the
de-facto currency in a setting that has no use for mundane money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to implement this is to say that victory in battle is worth 500
“soul points” for every character point it would have been worth according to
p. 92 of DF: Exploits. This means a battle against a small amount of fodder is
worth nothing, and a big boss fight with lots of extra henchthings thrown in
might be worth 1500 SP. Again, this is the same exchange rate you use to convert
points into money during character creation, and you can vary it to suit your
preferred pace of advancement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more detailed way to model it is to use the optional rules on the &lt;strong&gt;It’s a
Threat!&lt;/strong&gt; article on Pyramid #3/77, and say that a slain monster is worth soul
points equal to its Combat Effectiveness Rating. This method is a bit
math-intensive: the article has a table with values for a few published
monsters, but for anything outside of that you’ll have to calculate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter which method you’re using, an important decision you must make is
whether the “soul points” from a battle must be split among the PCs or if each
PC gets the full amount when the fight ends. The former setup results in much
slower advancement than the system in Exploits, while the latter more or less
keeps pace with it as far as combat experience is concerned. I do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
recommend fully copying Dark Souls and giving soul points from a monster only to
the PC who dealt the last blow: that works in a solo campaign, but nowhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Treasure” might still exist in this model in the form of dead adventurers with
residual soul points still present in their remains. This could lead to
entertaining scenes such as the party slaying a dragon and leaving its piles of
gold behind in favor of searching for the corpses of the previous parties that
failed to defeat it. And of course, if you’re using Havens and Hells then
Souls-like corpse runs are totally a thing that happens in that setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using soul points for advancement is a matter of converting them in town using
the reverse exchange rate: 500 SP for 1 character point. They can also be used
to buy stuff, in which case 1 SP is worth $1. So characters must choose between
buying equipment or upgrading their abilities, which will end up slowing
advancement overall and making looted gear that much more desirable. A suit of
fine armor you find in the wild is one you don’t have to spend Soul Points on!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>'Superheavy' Melee Weapons in GURPS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over- and undersized weapons are a popular trope for fantasy and
fantasy-adjacent stories. Those giants and pixies need something to fight with,
and human-scale warriors with huge swords is a itself a popular genre trope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GURPS already has a pretty good set of cinematic rules for representing
these. The best source of these is the &lt;em&gt;Scaling Weapons and Armor&lt;/em&gt; section found
in &lt;strong&gt;GURPS Low-Tech Companion 2: Weapons and Warriors&lt;/strong&gt;. GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
uses a limited subset of those in DF1 and 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few other tropes that mess around with weapon weights in a
supernatural way. Let’s take a look at how to represent them in GURPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;superheavy-weapons&quot;&gt;Superheavy Weapons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a melee weapon that’s the same size as its mundane counterpart, but it’s
a lot &lt;em&gt;heavier&lt;/em&gt;. It’s probably made out of a non-standard material, which
depending on the weapon might be a fruit of superscience or magic. Such weapons
are usually built for legendarily strong wielders! The increased weight not only
makes the weapons more deadly, but also allows its owner to employ their full
strength when fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To model these weapons, use the Scaling Weapons and Armor rules, with a few
modifications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Either pick a final weight for the weapon, or note the strength of its
intended wielder if you already know that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to page 21 of Low-Tech Companion 2, and pick the line whose “Typical User
ST” column most closely matches that of the wielder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you started with the weight, divide final weight by the “base” weight of
the weapon and pick the line whose Weight column is closest to the result.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Modify the weapon’s Damage, required ST, Weight and base cost as written in
LTC2. &lt;em&gt;Do not&lt;/em&gt; modify Reach or SM.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it! And yes, you can combine this with normal weapon scaling
to make a weapon whose weight is abnormally large for its size. In that case,
two extra steps apply after completing the procedure above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Multiply the weapon’s Reach by the value in the table row corresponding to the
SM of the intended wielder.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cost is the &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; of the weapon’s final modified cost, or the cost of a
standard SM 0 weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 1&lt;/strong&gt;: We’re making a super-strong martial artist character and we want
him to use an iron quarterstaff that’s ten times heavier than the wooden
variety. Looking at the table on LTC2 p. 21, we see that the closest multiplier
is 12.25, for the SM+3 line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After applying the modified process above, we end up with a weapon that has the
following qualities: Damage sw+7 cr or thr+7 cr; Reach 1, 2; Parry +2; Cost
$122,50; Weight 20kg (40 lbs); ST 25. So our hero would need at least ST 25 to
properly wield such a weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example 2&lt;/strong&gt;: We’re making a pixie barbarian using Dungeon Fantasy rules. Her
ST is 13, which is legendary for a people whose SM is -6 and whose typical ST
score is 5. We want her to wield a weapon that’s superheavy &lt;em&gt;for a pixie&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chosen base weapon is a Dueling Halberd. We use the SM -6 row in the table
for the halberd’s Reach multiplier, and the SM -2 row for everything else. Our
resulting halberd will weight only a quarter of the human version, but it will
be 25 times heavier than a “standard” pixie polearm, and weight more than its
wielder! Since its modified cost of $30 is lower than its base cost of $150, it
costs the same as a full-sized halberd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final stats are: Damage sw+2 cut or sw+2 imp or thr+2 imp; Reach C; Parry 0U
or 0; Cost $150; Weight 1.25kg (2.5 lbs); ST 6++. Note that our super-strong
pixie can wield this halberd one-handed without it becoming unready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;magically-attuned-weapons&quot;&gt;Magically Attuned Weapons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trope is popular in the Exalted roleplaying game. Magic weapons in that
setting are based both on some tales of classical mythology and on modern media
such as action anime and certain video games. The heroes who wield these weapons
“attune their essence” to them, which makes the weapons feel like they have
normal weight to their owners, while still being superheavy to everyone else -
particularly their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that characters wielding these weapons don’t have to be generically
super-strong, and that the ability to handle one weapon doesn’t give them the
ability to wield others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create such a weapon, use the same process outlined above for “superheavy”
weapons. Attunement is represented by a new advantage, which the weapon’s owner
must purchase in order to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;attunement-variable-cost&quot;&gt;Attunement (Variable Cost)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re attuned to a specific magical weapon which is super-heavy, oversized, or
both. You can wield it just as if it was a normal-sized weapon, though its
targets will still feel the full weight of your blows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To calculate the cost of this advantage, subtract your actual ST from the
weapon’s minimum ST and multiply it by 1.6, rounding up. Add 1 to the total if
the weapon is also oversized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attunement in no way “protects” your weapon! If it’s permanently lost or
destroyed, you lose all the points invested in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Details&lt;/em&gt;: This is just enough levels of Lifting and Striking ST with the
limitation “Only for this weapon” (-80%) to cover the difference between the
character’s ST score and the minimum ST for the weapon. The extra point for
oversized weapons is a specialized version of the Giant Weapons perk that
removes all penalties due to size difference, but only works for that single
weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: If the Iron Staff from the previous section was a magic artifact in
the style described here, a reedy ST 8 hero could attune to it by paying 28
character points. 25 - 8 is 17, which multiplied by 1,6 gives us 27,5, which is
then rounded up. This allows the hero to fight with the Staff as if he had
ST 25, and to ignore its great weight when carrying it, but he’ll still be ST 8
for all other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whomsoever-wields-this-hammer-should-he-be-worthy&quot;&gt;“Whomsoever wields this hammer, should he be worthy…”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third and final special weapon covered in this article are those powerful
magical artifacts that only allow those they deem worthy to even lift
them. Thor’s hammer from the Marvel comics and movies is a famous example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifting and using these weapons is not a matter of muscle mass, but of moral
strength. When you touch them, they judge you! If you pass that judgment, then
you can lift and wield the weapon as if it was a normal specimen of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t actually need to make these weapons superheavy or oversized. Instead,
they look for certain traits in a prospective wielder. Those who have these
traits are worthy. Those who don’t can’t even lift the weapon, even if they’re
the strongest being in the universe muscle-wise. I generally consider this to be
a story effect and wouldn’t try to put a price tag on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weapon like movie-Mjolnir might look for one or more virtues along the lines
of Honesty, Selfless, Charitable and so on. An evil weapon would instead look
for Bloodlust or Sadism. They would of course also avoid traits opposite to
those they like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the weapon in question is also superheavy or oversized, then it could grant
worthy wielders the ST to use it, similar to how Attunement works, at no cost to
the wielder. If you’re writing up the weapon as a character, this would be a
benefficial Affliction granting the Attunement advantage described in the
previous section of this article. Simplify its cost by having it grant a number
of levels of ST equal to the minimum needed to wield the weapon regardless of
the wielder’s current ST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: The Iron Staff belonged to the Monkey King! Though it will shun
Bloodthirsty, Callous, Greedy or Sadistic individuals, it will deem worthy
anyone who shows its former master’s heroic spirit, martial prowess, or love of
mischief. Anyone with at least two of Selfless, a Code of Honor or Higher
Purpose to fight evil, Trained by a Master, Curious, or Trickster could be
deemed worthy and be considered to have ST 25 when wielding the staff.&lt;/p&gt;
