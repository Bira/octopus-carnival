        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Not only have monstrous spiders been in the game since the beginning, they’ve
been on every monster book we read so far. The MM3 is no exception in this
case.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Looks like the Web Walk trait was a <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/01/05/spider.html">Monster Vault</a> innovation. The spiders
in the MM3 don’t have it, but it would make sense for them to do so. They do
already use fixed math, like the other monsters in this book.</p>

<p>All spiders here have a climb speed equal to their ground speed, with the Spider
Climb keyword to signal that they can also walk on ceilings. They also have
Tremorsense 5.</p>

<h2 id="ambush-spider">Ambush Spider</h2>

<p>Sometimes you have to go back to basics, and you can’t get any more basic than
this. These Medium natural spiders behave much like mundane trapdoor spiders,
using webs to camouflage their hidey-holes and charging out of them to bite and
inject venom into their prey. As Level 2 Lurkers with 28 HP, they’re likely the
first giant spider any group of adventures is going to face. I’m surprised
something like this only showed up in the MM3. Their speed is a breezy 8.</p>

<p>The spider’s <strong>Camouflage</strong> trait allows it to hide when it has only partial
cover or concealment. Its basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong>, but it turns into a
<strong>Venomous Bite</strong> if made against a creature the spider is hidden from. This
does the same damage and can be used in a charge. It also slows the target and
inflicts 5 ongoing poison damage (save ends). This worsens to immobilized after
the first failed save.</p>

<h2 id="spiderling">Spiderling</h2>

<p>Spiderlings are immature giant spiders, merely Small in size. This is a generic
stat block that can be used to represent youngsters of any of the spider species
presented here or elsewhere. They’re Level 4 Minion Skirmishers with Speed 6 and
a basic bite attack.</p>

<p>The attack deals only 2 poison damage, but it also gives poison vulnerability 5
to the target for a turn. If the target is already vulnerable to poison their
vulnerability increases by 2 instead. This means that multiple spiderling bites
on the same victim add up very fast, particularly if the adults join in at the
end. You can vary their level based on the expected level of the adult
specimens.</p>

<h2 id="feyspitter-spider">Feyspitter Spider</h2>

<p>This spider native to the Feywild produces a venom laced with psychedelic
fairy-tale qualities. Aside from the usual physiological damage, it also forces
its victims to dance uncontrolably! Over time, feyspitter hunting grounds come
to look like clearings where the vegetation has been stomped flat by all the
dancers.</p>

<p>Feyspitters are Medium Fey Beasts and Level 7 Controllers with 80 HP and a Speed
of 6. Their <strong>bite</strong> deals physical damage and inflicts 5 ongoing poison damage
(save ends). Each time the victim fails a save, the spider can slide them 3
squares.</p>

<p>They can also use <strong>Poison Spittle</strong> to spray their venom in a Close
Blast 3. This deams 10 ongoing poison damage on everyone it hits, with the same
sliding effect on each failed save. Finally, if hit in melee, feyspitters can
use a <strong>Fey Leap</strong> (recharge 5+) to teleport 3 squares as an interrupt. Yes,
this means they can jump out of melee range and negate any damage.</p>

<h3 id="lolths-reaver">Lolth’s Reaver</h3>

<p>Another epic level spider directly associated with Lolth. These spiders don’t
exist in the wild. Instead, they’re bred by Lolth’s worshippers and fed the
blood of elves, eladrin and angels from an early age. Their upbringing makes
them sapient and Chaotic Evil. They commonly serve as mounts for Abyssal Drow,
and can also be found as pets and guardians in Lolth’s mightiest temples
elsewhere in the universe.</p>

<p>Reavers are Large Elemental Beasts with the Mount and Spider keywords. They’re
Level 25 Brutes with 287 HP. They have a ground speed of 8, but their Climb
speed is only 6. Their mount trait is <strong>Web Saddle</strong>, which prevents their rider
from being involuntarily dismounted by forced movement. I never even knew this
was a possibility for anyone else, so I find this very interesting. Enough PCs
have easy access to forced movement that staying mounted might very well be a
problem for an enemy rider in most situations. Not here, though.</p>

<p>Reavers fight with their extremely venomous <strong>bites</strong>, which deal light physical
damage and inflict 20 ongoing poison damage (save ends). They can shoot
<strong>Grasping Threads</strong> at range, which deal no damage but pull the target 5
squares and restrain them (save ends). Each failed saving throw causes the
reaver to pull the target an additional 5 squares. There is no hard limit on the
number of targets that can be restrained in this way.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the reaver can perform a <strong>Web Leap</strong>, jumping 8 squares
without provoking opportunity attacks and spreaying a Close Blast 3 with sticky
webs when they land. This does heavy physical damage, knocks its targets prone,
and prevents them from standing up (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="spider-webs">Spider Webs</h3>

<p>This is not a monster, but a side box with example terrain features based on
spider webs. All of the spiders in this entry and most of the ones in previous
books are web-spinners, so these should see heavy usage in arachnid-themed
dungeons.</p>

<p>These hazards have variable DCs and attack rolls based on their level, which
should be similar to that of the overall encounter. The more badass the spider,
the more badass its webs.</p>

<p><strong>Web Sheets</strong> are nearly invisible vertical webs, usually placed across
passages and corridors. Spotting them requires a Perception test against the
hard DC for their level. When someone enters their space, they attack the
victim’s Reflex and immobilize them (save ends). A close or area fire attack
destroys the whole web, a melee fire attack destroys one square of it.</p>

<p><strong>Cobwebs</strong> are thick and opaque sheets of webbing covering walls, floors, and
ceilings. Spiders use these for concealment, hiding behind them until it’s time
to burst out and strike. They provide total concealment, and spiders can usually
perceive enemies through them using tremorsense. They might also count as
difficult terrain.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We’re starting to repeat ourselves a bit with all these spiders, but it’s nice
to see a low-level example. I also really liked the Feyspitter for its dancing
venom.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/10/23/orchard-of-time.html">The Orchard of Time</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I had an interesting dream recently that gave me what I think is a neat idea for
a dungeon location: The Orchard of Time.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>It’s started out as your standard divine orchard, a bit like the Garden of the
Hesperides. It was owned and operated by a powerful spirit or minor deity, and
its trees gave fruit that ranged from “mundane but high-quality” to “outright
miraculous” the further in you went. If you got to the very center, you could
harvest the Peaches of Immortality or something equally awesome.</p>

<p>Something happened to the Orchard’s original owners and they left, abandoning
the place. Monstrous fauna from the surrounding regions moved in and either
overwhelmed the previous guardians or entered some sort of symbiosis with
them. These new monsters found ample food in the trees of the Orchard, whose
energies mutated them to be larger and stronger.</p>

<p>One day, a powerful arch-wizard found the Orchard’s location and decided to go
for the Peaches. This extremely arrogant individual was sure he would succeed
where all others have failed. After all, the others weren’t him! He armed
himself with his best spells and his best magic items, and teleported to the
Orchard’s entrance (can’t teleport into it from outside). Then he boldly strode
past the gate, and cast his most powerful magic.</p>

<p>This was a custom spell that would stop time everywhere in the Orchard except
for an area five meters or so in radius around the wizard himself. The idea was
that, with time stoped, the archmage could just walk up to the really good trees
in the center while dodging the place’s many inhabitants. If he needed to remove
any of them, he could bring them into the “active time” circle and use his other
magic to handle them one individual or small group at a time.</p>

<p>Of course, the wizard’s hubris got the better of him at exactly the worst
time. Maybe he had miscalculated when creating the spell, or maybe he made a
critical error when casting it. The fact is that our wizard just
kinda… exploded, leaving behind only his ornate metal staff.</p>

<p>Ironically, the spell itself worked exactly as planned. Even better in fact, as
the same error that deleted our wizard made it last forever. It’s centered on
the wizard’s staff, which stands planted on the ground just inside the Orchard’s
entrance gate.</p>

<h2 id="layout-and-hazards">Layout and Hazards</h2>

<p>The Orchard is located in a hidden valley and is bordered by tall forested
mountains. The climate can range from temperate to tropical depending on what
kind of fruit you want it to contain. As mentioned above, vestigial divine wards
prevent people from finding it with divination or from teleporting into it from
outside. It can still be found via good old-fashioned research, as its location
is recorded in ancient religious texts and in the unfortunate wizard’s own
notes. The wizard has also helpfully dispelled any magical defenses that
prevented people from just walking through the main gate.</p>

<p>The Orchard of Time was a little overgrown from its period of abandonment, but
still retains its characteristic layout. There are many trees but they’re spaced
far apart. Cobbled paths wind their way among them. Grass and other wild plants
reach up to a human’s knees between the trees and paths. This space used to be
taken up by a lawn and flower beds, but these have been overwhelmed by native
plants.</p>

<p>This means that despite covering a very large area, the Orchard has excellent
sight lines and a clearly navigable layout. You can see a good deal of its
significant landmarks from the entrance gate and it’s impossible to get lost
inside. These excellent sight lines work against intruders such as the PCs,
because they allow the many, many monsters and guardians that live here to see
them from far away. These creatures are all hostile, territorial, and generally
incapable of dialogue either because they have animal intellect or because
they’re some sort of construct. In the dream I had these monsters definitely
included a variety of Rodents of Unusual Size. There are almost more monsters
than there are fruit, and they all more or less converge on the location of any
intruders they can perceive.</p>

<p>Or they <em>would</em>, if time hadn’t stopped inside. The wizard’s staff is just
inside the entrance, and it projects a field of “normal time” in a 5-meter
radius around itself. Everything outside this bubble and inside the orchard’s
outer walls is frozen in time, and has been for a long time (decades?
centuries?).</p>

<p>PCs who want to succeed where the arrogant wizard failed need to carry the staff
with them. Getting close enough to a monster that it enters the “bubble” will
unfreeze the creature, and it will imediately attack. There might be a route
that allows them to avoid most of the creatures, but not all.</p>

<p>In addition to the copious monsters, the permanent time stop might have created
hazardous areas inside the Orchard, where space or time itself behave in harmful
ways. These might be almost impossible to detect until they’re inside the active
time bubble, which would make them reveal themselves in a dramatic fashion.</p>

<h2 id="why-go-there">Why go there?</h2>

<p>The most obvious reason to delve the Orchard of Time is to get its most awesome
fruits from the big trees at the center, like the wizard wanted to do. The
Orchard might also contain buildings of interest (such as libraries or treasure
vaults), along with the bodies of ancient adventurers who tried to delve the
place before the ill-fated wizard. Some of these might be legendary themselves,
and have died carrying their equally legendary gear.</p>

<p>A slightly alternate Orchard would have been invaded by the wizard while it was
still operational! In this case it’s going to be in pristine condition, with all
of its original guardians and security systems still in place. Even its <em>owners</em>
will still be around, frozen in time like flies in amber. Freeing them is an
excellent goal for more heroic sorts, or at least for sorts who need the
specific help whose divine entities are able to provide.</p>

<p>However, since those owners are frozen in time, they’re still going to be under
the impression that they’re being invaded by a cheeky wizard. And look at you,
carrying his staff around like that. Better talk fast!</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/10/21/spawn-of-kyuss.html">Let&#39;s Read the Monster Manual 3: Spawn of Kyuss</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>The Spawn of Kyuss were introduced in the Age of Worms adventure path,
originally published in Dungeon Magazine in 2005-2006, when it was run by
Paizo. Some of Kyuss’ most powerful servants were reprinted in the Elder Evils
supplement for 3.5e, and later got conversion stats in an early 4th edition web
enhancement file. This means this is technically not the Spawn’s 4e debut, but
it is the first time we get complete lore and lower-than-epic stats for them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In ancient times, Kyuss was a mortal magician and a charismatic cult leader, who
led his followers to a remote jungle region in order to establish a base. There,
he found ruins from an even more ancient pre-human civilization. With the
knowledge he learned from those ruins, the cultist sacrificed his followers in a
ritual to become a giant undead demigod whose body was made out of bright green
worms. The Worm that Walks spent a long time imprisoned outside the world, but
the prophecy of the Age of Worms foretells that he will return and devour the
world in what is basically a worm-fueled zombie apocalypse.</p>

<p>The Spawn of Kyuss are undead created by infecting corpses with worms plucked
from his own body. They’re easily distinguished by the wriggling mass of green
worms crawling all over them, inside and outside. They’re Kyuss’ agents in the
world and their presence presages his return. Even if the Worm’s return is not
imminent, these creatures might still be found performing some task that
furthers their patron’s interests, whether by themselves or allied with
cultists.</p>

<p>The first Spawn were Kyuss’ original followers, sacrificed in that first
ritual. Making new ones is a matter of performing a simple worm transplant from
a spawn to an available body, living or dead. The ones listed here are not
particularly smart, but it’s worth remembering that <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/06/21/larva-mage.html">Larva Mages</a> are also
the spawn of Kyuss.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three varieties of Spawn here, all suitable as threats to Paragon-tier
parties. They’re Medium Natural Animates with a Speed of 5 and Darkvision, plus
the usual undead traits: immunity to disease and poison, a resistance to
necrotic damage, and a vulnerability to radiant damage. They’re also vulnerable
to fire - it burns the worms right up.</p>

<p>All of the spawn here can also transmit the Touch of Kyuss, which is basically
an infestation of evil supernatural worms. It’s treated as a Level 16 disease
resisted with Endurance (DC 25 to improve or 20 to maintain). Stage 1 makes the
victim regain only half hit points from spending healing surges, and causes them
to rise as wretches of Kyuss if they die. Stage 2 causes them to lose 2 healing
surges, and if they ever reach 0 surges they die and rise as Sons of
Kyuss. Stage 3 cuts to the chase and kills the victim right away so it can rise
as a Son.</p>

<h3 id="son-of-kyuss">Son of Kyuss</h3>

<p>These things look like zombies at a first glance, but they’re sapient and much
stronger. Their goal is to usually spread the “blessing” of Kyuss to as many
living people as they can. Though they’re not exactly geniuses at Int 6, they
can and will coordinate in order to accomplish it.</p>

<p>Sons of Kyuss are Level 13 Brutes with 158 HP. They project a <strong>Fear of Worms</strong>
aura which inflicts a -2 attack penalty to living creatures inside. Their basic
attack is a <strong>Slam</strong> that damages and exposes the target to the Touch of
Kyuss. It can also “shoot” <strong>Burrowing Worms</strong> in a Close Burst 1 (recharge
5+). A hit inflicts 10 ongoing damage, increasing to 15 on the first failed save
and to 20 plus stun on the second. If someone dies from this they immediately
rise as a wretch of Kyuss (see below). The wretch must be destroyed before the
victim can be raised.</p>

<h3 id="wretch-of-kyuss">Wretch of Kyuss</h3>

<p>An undead creature with a lower worm content than a full Son of Kyuss. It’s less
sturdy but still quite dangerous and quite contagious, being a Level 13 Minion
Brute. Its <strong>Slam</strong> deals light necrotic damage, and when it dies it bursts,
inflicting necrotic damage in a Close Burst 1 and exposing anyone hit by this
attack to the Touch of Kyuss.</p>

<h3 id="herald-of-kyuss">Herald of Kyuss</h3>

<p>These undead abomination were created from the bodies of angels sent by the gods
to stop the Worm that Walks. They’re Medium Immortal Animates (undead), and have
all the same traits as the other spawn. Also, they can fly at speed 6.</p>

<p>The Herald is a Level 16 Artillery monster with 116 HP. They have the same Fear
of Worms aura as the Son, plus a <strong>Writhing Host</strong> aura of the same size that
deals 10 necrotic damage to enemies caught inside. All of their attacks expose
the target to the Touch of Kyuss on a hit, making them the most contagious spawn
of all.</p>

<p>Their basic melee attack is a <strong>Rotting Caress</strong> that deals necrotic
damage. They can attack at range by making <strong>Writhing Pronouncements</strong> that deal
immediate and ongoing 5 necrotic damage. This worsens to 10 and a daze on the
first failed save, and to 15 and a stun on the second (save ends). People killed
by this turn into wretches of Kyuss, which must be destroyed before the victims
can be raised.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can call an <strong>Eruption of Maggots</strong> that acts as a
disgusting fireball-sized area attack. It deals immediate and ongoing necrotic
damage, and also creates a damaging zone that lasts for the rest of the
encounter.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Ewwww. Kill these with fire as soon as possible. If your GM is re-enacting the
Age of Worms campaign, you can expect to run into these things very often. Their
main gimmick is all about infecting people with the Touch of Kyuss, so PCs can
expect to stop and cast Remove Affliction more or less after every fight unless
they’re under extreme time pressure. Stage 1 is already a major debuff, and
staying at Stage 2 is a serious gamble.</p>

<p>Slaads have appeared in every 4e Monster Manual so far. This one gives us more
exotic varieties.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Basic slaad lore remains the same: technically sapient frog-like monsters from
the Elemental Chaos with lolrandom minds and a propensity to implant eggs into
other creatures. You can see the lore specific to each new variety in their
descriptions below.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>As a reminder, chaos phage is a level 16 disease that represents being implanted
with a slaad egg. Stage 1 has no effect beyond this, stage 2 gives you a Will
penalty and makes you attack randomly while bloodied, stage 3 means the embryo
bursts out of your skull and kills you.</p>

<p>Like other diseases it’s not hard to remove with the right ritual, but the
symptoms are severe enough that you’ll want to do it sooner rather than
later. And as usual the ritual takes time and costs a bunch of healing surges,
so it’s something that might add time pressure to a slaad focused adventure.</p>

<h3 id="golden-slaad">Golden Slaad</h3>

<figure class="center">

<p>Slaads are mostly immune to the chaos storms that often rage through portions of
the Elemental Chaos, which is why they like to follow these storms around. When
one of these storms manages to affect a slaad, it can mutate it into a golden
slaad. Golden Slaads are revered by their chromatic brethren, who follow them
around as if they were a chaos storm themselves.</p>

<p>Golden slaads are even more chaos-infused than their relatives, and can inject
that raw chaos in any victims they bite. Their gold-colored forms are unstable,
and if they’re wounded they became unable to sustain those forms, becoming
quivering (but still dangerous!) piles of ooze.</p>

<p>These creatures are Huge Elemental Humanoids and Level 20 Controllers with 193
HP. They have a ground speed of 8 and a teleport speed of 6, as well as
low-light vision and an immunity to chaos phage (like all slaads).</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> is reach 3 and deals physical damage, with a random rider
depending on the result of the attack roll. If the roll is odd, it slides the
target 3 squares. If it’s even, it dazes them for a turn.</p>

<p>They can also emit <strong>Chaos Croaks</strong> in a Close Burst 5 (recharge 5+). This
targets Will, does psychic damage, and has a random rider rolled on a d6 table:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Target is teleported 1d6 squares in a random direction (rolled on a d8).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Target makes a melee basic attack against a random creature adjacent to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Target is stunned for a turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Target is slowed (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Target takes an extra 10 damage of a random elemental type rolled on a d10.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Target is exposed to chaos phage, and if it was dazed by the slad it becomes
stunned instead (save ends).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When the slaad is first bloodied it suffers an <strong>Amniotic Transformation</strong> and
becomes an ooze. It becomes unable to teleport and its speed drops to 4, but it
gains a <strong>Corrosive Pseudopodia</strong> attack that can be used as an opportunity
action against any adjacent enemy who moves or makes an attack. It deals minor
acid damage and grabs the target on a hit. With a minor action, the slaad can
sustian all of its grabs, deal acid damage to the victims, and regain 5 HP per
grabbed victim. So the loss of speed isn’t that crippling, because the slaad now
<em>wants</em> people to get adjacent to it. And it still retains the use of its other
attacks!</p>

<h3 id="putrid-slaad">Putrid Slaad</h3>

<p>This is an undead slaad. While it’s most often created on purpose by powerful
necromancers, it can also arise naturally when a slaad dies in the Abyss. These
“natural” putrid slaads have a tendency to obey demon lords, so you bet Orcus
loves them.</p>

<p>The putrid slaad loses its ability to spread chaos phage, but it still fights
very similarly to a living one. It will even eat its victims. The remains rot
inside its non-functional guts, and then the monster vomits them when it attacks
its <em>next</em> victims.</p>

<p>Putrid Slaads are Large Elemental Animates (Undead), and Level 19 Brutes with
227 HP. Its basic <strong>Claw</strong> attack pulls the target 1 square, and <strong>Graping
Claws</strong> allows it to make 2 of those with a single action. If both attacks hit,
the slaad grabs the victim.</p>

<p>Once the putrid slaad has grabbed someone, it will hit them with its <strong>Horrific
Spew</strong> (recharge 6), which deals both immediate and ongoing acid and necrotic
damage (save ends). The spew can also be used as a Close Blast 3 attack, but it
has a +2 to-hit bonus when focused on the grabbed victim.</p>

<p>The slaad can also <strong>cast aside</strong> its grabbed victim, pushing them 5 squares,
dealing some automatic physical damage to the victim, and using it to make an
area attack against anyone adjacent to the victim when it lands.</p>

<h2 id="personal-impressions">Personal Impressions</h2>

<p>More slaads. As far as late-edition slaads go, these are pretty cool
mechanically. Golden Slaads finally deliver the promised dose of pure chaos
people expect when they first read the slaad’s basic lore, and putrid slaads
have this cool cycle of grabbing people and tossing them aside, with an
occasional dose of disgusting barf.</p>

<p>Skulks first appeared on the AD&amp;D Fiend Folio. This is their 4e debut, with
all-new lore.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Centuries ago, the human empire of Bael Turath fought a dreadful war against the
dragonborn empire of Arkhosia. Bael Turath was never a nice place: its society
was severely stratified, and its ruling nobles were slavers that spared little
thought to those they enslaved. When it found itself losing the war against
Arkhosia, those same ruling nobles did not hesitate to turn to Hell for help,
and forged the diabolic pact that would see them and their descendants
transformed into tieflings. We’ve seen all of this before, and we also know that
the pact didn’t help them in the end. Bael Turath fell just the same, with the
pact’s boon at most allowing them to take Arkhosia with them.</p>

<p>In this entry we see one of the reasons why it fell. The pact for infernal power
excluded Bael Turath’s large enslaved population, even as it lowered the
slavers’ guard. There was a huge rebellion where many of Bael Turath’s noble
caste were murdered in their sleep. Some of the rebels did this to escape their
bonds, but some did it because they were angry at being excluded from the
infernal pact. The Demon Prince Graz’zt was impressed with the latter and
reached out to them to offer his patronage. Those who accepted became the
creatures known as skulks.</p>

<p>Skulks are sapient humanoids with a supernatural affinity for
stealth. Ironically enough, they are much more indebted to their demon patron
than modern-day tieflings are to whatever devil mutated their ancestors. This
eternal debt is encoded in a document known as the <em>Book of the Blinded Eye</em>,
and it bids even present-day skulks to follow the orders of Graz’zt’s
servants. They’re often sent out as assassins to eliminate threats to the cult
or their demon master.</p>

<p>The skulks’ hatred of tieflings is equally eternal, and probably also enforced
by the demonic pact. Skulks live as if Bael Turath never fell, and as if they’re
still infiltrated behind enemy lines. Left to their own devices, they will
pursue their original mission of murdering all tieflings. They spread along with
the tiefling diaspora as the latter fled their fallen empire. Any present-day
settlement that contains a sizable tiefling population is also likely to contain
a skulk population preying on them.</p>

<p>The book paints all skulks with this demonic brush, but it would be simple to
say only a small percentage of them are this horrible, just like only a small
percentage of tieflings are diabolists. As with most other humanoid entries, you
can treat this one describing the form skulk <em>villains</em> usually take, and not as
a species-wide portrayal.</p>

<p>I imagine non-evil skulks would simply be reclusive and wish to be left alone,
either living in their own isolated communities or still “infiltrating” those of
others but without trying to murder anyone.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Skulks are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 6 and Low-Light
Vision. Their signature trait is Stealthy Step, which exempts them from the
Stealth penalty for moving more than 2 squares per turn or for running. All of
the individual entries have additional stealth powers beyond that, appropriate
to their role.</p>

<p>The entries here are appropriate threats for an early-to-mid-Heroic party. More
powerful skulks up to epic tier certainly exist, but are left as an exercise to
the GM.</p>

<h3 id="skulk-mesmerist">Skulk Mesmerist</h3>

<p>A spellcaster specializing in charm and illusion magic. It’s a Level 3
Controller with 45 HP. Mesmerists fight with a <strong>short sword</strong> and have a couple
of active attack powers. The first is <strong>Luring Charm</strong>, a non-damaging ranged
attack that targets Will, slides the target 4 squares, and dazes then for a
turn. The other is <strong>Mesmerize</strong> (recharge 5+) a ranged attack that targets
Will, deals psychic damage, and makes the target unable to see any enemies other
than the mesmerist themselves (save ends).</p>

<p>As a minor action, they can also use <strong>Deceptive Veil</strong> to look like any Medium
or Small humanoid. Piercing the illusion requires a DC 26 Insight check, which
is very hard even for a dedicated PC at this level. This is actually more
powerful than the Changeling’s disguise ability, since it also allows the
mesmerist to look like a Small humanoid.</p>

<p>Skulk Mesmerists like to kill two birds with one stone by murdering a target
while looking like someone they want to frame for that murder. Their Veil also
makes it possible for the GM to make an adventure where an innocent changeling
is charged for a string of murders perpetrated by a skulk mesmerist.</p>

<h3 id="skulk-murderer">Skulk Murderer</h3>

<p>This one does what it says on the tin. Over and over and over. It’s a Level 3
Lurker with 37 HP.</p>

<p>Aside from the standard Stealthy Step trait, the murderer also has <strong>Peerless
Camouflage</strong> that allows it to hide while it only has partial cover or
concealment, and to remain hidden if it still has cover or concealment at the
end of a movement. It also has <strong>Unseen Strike</strong>, which lets it deal extra
damage against targets that couldn’t see at the start of its turn.</p>

<p>The murderer fights with a <strong>Short sword</strong> and can thrown a <strong>Shuriken Volley</strong>
once per encounter. This lets it make three ranged attacks, which deal a bit of
damage and immobilize (save ends) on a hit. All of these can benefit from Unseen
Strike.</p>

<p>When playing one of these, you want to start the fight hidden and open it with a
Shuriken Volley. Then you alternate between re-establishing stealth and striking
with the sword. A mesmerist in the same team as the murder makes it a lot more
dangerous, because now the murderer doesn’t need to waste time hiding to benefit
from Unseen Strike.</p>

<h3 id="skulk-hunter">Skulk Hunter</h3>

<p>Another stealthy killer, but this one is a Level 5 Soldier with 61 HP. It fights
with a longsword, and even its basic attack is funny: it’s called <strong>Baffling
Blade</strong>, and it if hits it allows the hunter to stay hidden from the target. Its
special attack is the <strong>Invisible Blade</strong> (recharge 5+), which targets someone
who can’t see the hunter, deals double damage, and inflicts ongoing 5 damage
(save ends).</p>

<p>Both attacks mark the target as an effect, and if an enemy marked by the hunter
shifts the hunter gets to use Baffling Blade against them.</p>

<p>Hunters also go very well with mesmerists: the mesmerist can make them invisible
to a PC while they set up as the traditional front line preventing the PC from
reaching the mesmerist. They can use Invisible Blade against the afflicted
victim without having to hide, and they can also hide without having to leave
formation.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in the lore entry, I like this entry much better if I read it as
describing the typical skulk <em>villain</em> instead of describing the typical
<em>skulk</em>. Mechanically, I like how the three stat blocks synergize - they’re
clearly meant to be used together.</p>

<p>Allied monsters might include Graz’zt cultists and minor demons. Anything that
can make their monster buddies invisible also works really well with skulks.</p>
