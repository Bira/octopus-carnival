<p>Sprites are super-tiny humanoid fey, tinier even than the pixies that would show
up as a playable option in <em>Heroes of the Feywild</em>. I think they’ve been in the
game since at least AD&amp;D 1st Edition in some for or another.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Sprites in earlier editions tended to be described as just tiny fairy folk who
liked all the usual Victorian Fairy things like song and dance and pastoral
nature. They might have a propensity for pranks, but normally didn’t get more
aggressive than that unless the PCs were out to exterminate them. A single
sprite was pretty much harmless, but they often came in large numbers.</p>

<p>These aren’t the sprites from earlier editions. These are Umbral Sprites.</p>

<p>Umbral Sprites are just as tiny as the nice variety, but they’re cruel,
violent, and territorial. Interactions between them and the PCs skip right past
the talky and pranky stages and go right to combat as swarms of these things
descend upon them. A single umbral sprite is still harmless to an adventurer,
but a swarm of them is dangerous enough to get monster stats.</p>

<p>Though these tiny terrors are native to the Feywild, they tend to seek out areas
that contain crossings to the Shadowfell to claim as territory. Spriggans and
ill-intentioned gnomes tend to ally with them and use them as diversions for
subtler schemes. It’s hard to notice gnomes sneaking into your vaults when you
have a cloud of angry sprites poking out your eyes.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>This entry gives us stats for a fairly small swarm of umbral sprites. This is a
Medium swarm composed of Fey Humanoids, and counts as a Level 4 Controller with
55 HP. It has blindsight with range 6, a ground speed of 4, and a flight speed
of 6 with Hover.</p>

<p>It also has the standard swarm traits: it takes half damage from single-target
attacks, and extra damage from area attacks. Its <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura (1) deals
3 damage to creatures caught inside.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>Swarm of Fangs and Blades</strong>, but aside from the name
it’s nothing spectacular. Their special <strong>Darkwave</strong> attack (recharge 5+) is
more impressive. It’s a Close Burst 3 that targets Reflex, does necrotic damage,
and creates a zone of darkness that lasts for a durn.</p>

<p>They also have the gnome’s <strong>Fade Away</strong> power, becoming invisible as a reaction
to taking damage once per encounter. This invisibility lasts for a turn, or
until they hit or miss with an attack.</p>

<p>When fighting a group of PCs, they’re going to rely on Darkwave to keep them in
the dark and will use basic attacks and the swarm aura to deal damage while that
power recharges. The sprites are unaffected by their own darkness due to their
blindsight.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions.</h3>

<p>You can model a larger group of umbral sprites by using several swarms in an
encounter, or by increasing the level and size of a single one. They also make
me think about adapting <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/152691/The-Dreams-of-Ruin">The Dreams of Ruin</a> to 4e, because they look like
they are the base creature for Murdersprites. A murdersprite swarm is probably
more like a Colossal Level 14-18 Brute, though.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 5, and is a grab-bag of Feywild hazards: 2
ettercap fang guards working with 2 sprite swarms and 2 fey panthers.</p>

<p>I can’t find spriggans in my 2nd edition and earlier books, but I know they’re
in Pathfinder, so they were probably introduced in D&amp;D 3.x. This entry is their
4e debut. It feels like there’s been some condensing here because this entry
also uses several other names that I’m sure belonged to separate “small evil
fey” enemies, like “redcap” and “powrie”.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Back in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/21/gnome.html">post on gnomes</a>, we already saw that the gnome people used to be
enslaved by the fomorians in the ancient past, but that they managed to
escape. Here, we learn that not all of them managed to get away. Those
unfortunates were eventually twisted into spriggans by fomorian magic. It’s
unclear whether this happened as punishment for the escape attempt, or during
some subsequent experiment.</p>

<p>The book doesn’t describe present-day spriggans as fomorian slaves, so maybe
they were discarded by their former masters as failures. They live in
underground settlements excavated under rugged terrain.</p>

<p>Fomorian magic warped spriggan hearts as much as it did their bodies. Soaking
stuff in the blood of enemies seems to be a big deal to them. Their habit of
doing that to their hats caused them to also be known as redcaps by other
sapients. Spriggan communities delight in raiding, tormenting and extracting
tribute from their weaker neighbors, behaving pretty much like bandit gangs.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Spriggans are Small Fey Humanoids with low-light vision and a ground speed
of 6. Their signature ability is <strong>Redcap Zeal</strong>, a free-action encounter power
that grants them temporary HP when they bloody or defeat an enemy.</p>

<h3 id="spriggan-giantsoul">Spriggan Giantsoul</h3>

<p>Giantsouls tap into the fomorian magic in their blood, which gives them enhanced
strength and the ability to stretch their arms to gain a giant’s reach. They’re
Level 8 Brutes with 106 HP.</p>

<p>These spriggans fight unarmed, using <strong>slams</strong> as their basic attack. The
stretch-arm thing comes into play in the <strong>Giantsoul Slam</strong> special attack
(recharge 4+), which is Reach 2, does the same damage as the slam, and knocks
prone on a hit. Both attacks deal bonus damage when the spriggan is bloodied.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, the giantsoul can use a <strong>Surprise Slam</strong>, an interrupt that
triggers when an enemy within 2 squares of them attacks an ally. This allows it
to use Giantsoul Slam against the triggering enemy, recharging the ability if
necessary.</p>

<p>They’re good frontliners, with a limited ability to protect squishier allies
when the PCs try to get around them.</p>

<h3 id="spriggan-powrie">Spriggan Powrie</h3>

<p>All spriggans use iron-shod boots as part of their combat gear, but powries have
a particular dedication to the fine art of stomping. They’re Level 7 Skirmishers
with 79 HP.</p>

<p>The powrie fights with a <strong>sickle</strong> that does light physical damage and inflicts
ongoing damage. It can also be used in a <strong>Hamstring</strong> special attack that has
the same effects and also knocks prone and slows for a turn. This recharges when
the powrie is first bloodied.</p>

<p>Against prone enemies it can use the amusing <strong>Punt The Fallen</strong> attack, which
deals the same damage as the sickle and pushes 3 squares. The best thing about
this attack is that it’s an at-will minor action!</p>

<p>If the powrie has combat advantage against a creature taking ongoing damage,
attacking that creature with any of the above will also increase their ongoing
damage by 5.</p>

<p>Finally, the <strong>Blood Slide</strong> passive trait prevents the powrie from provoking
opportunity attacks when leaving a square adjacent to a creature who’s bloodied
or taking ongoing damage.</p>

<p>So most of the time a powrie will be attacking enemies with the sickle and
moving around the battlefield with the aid of Blood Slide in order to spread as
much ongoing damage around as possible, and will then seek combat advantgae
against a single target. Hamstring and Punt the Fallen is an hilarious
combination, and the latter means powries pair really well with other enemies
who can drop targets prone more often. Multiple powries in a fight mean you can
begin an impromptu soccer match with a prone PC as the ball.</p>

<h3 id="spriggan-thorn">Spriggan Thorn</h3>

<p>The spriggan thorn is armed with a short sword and a light shield, which are
imbued with a curse of thorns. The sword itself is enveloped in them, and the
spriggan can curse an enemy and cause thorns to spring from under their
skin. It’s a Level 6 Soldier with 71 HP.</p>

<p>The <strong>Short Sword</strong> damages and inflicts ongoing damage (thorns!). It can be
enhanced with the <strong>Drowsing Puncture</strong> power as a minor action. This makes the
next attack daze the target for a turn and knock them prone, if it hits. It
recharges when the thorn is first bloodied.</p>

<p>The curse is called <strong>Mark of Thorns</strong>, and it’s an encounter power that
automatically hits a target in a Close Burst 5. A cursed target can’t make
opportunity attacks against the thorn, and takes 4 damage at the end of any turn
in which it didn’t attack the thorn. Any allies of the target that start the
turn adjacent to them also take 4 damage.</p>

<p>Drowsing Puncture is a fine skill to use against PC defenders, and the Mark is
quite versatile. When used against a defender, it allows the thorn to slip past
the PC front-line unmolested. It also works to diver the attention of any PC who
would normally gain more by attacking one of the spriggan’s more fragile
allies. They pair really well with powries, who can end up increasing the
ongoing damage caused by the swords.</p>

<h3 id="spriggan-witherer">Spriggan Witherer</h3>

<p>Witherers are spriggan spellcasters who specialize in harmful weather control
magic. They can probably cause serious trouble to agrarian communities with
rituals, and they can also create more localized effects useful in
combat. They have an obsession with soaking the earth in blood, so they pair
well with enemies with a similar imagery. They’re Level 8 Artillery with 70 HP
and the Leader keyword.</p>

<p>Their melee attack is a <strong>whithering touch</strong> vs. Reflex that deals necrotic
damage. Their main single-target ranged attack is <strong>Sun Scorch</strong> (Ranged 10
vs. Reflex) dealing fire and radiant damage. They can use a spell named
<strong>Flattening Wind</strong> either as a close blast 3 or as an area 3/range 10 attack
vs. Fortitude. This deals physical damage, pushes 2 squares, and knocks
prone. It recharges when they’re first bloodied.</p>

<p>After they’re bloodied, they can use <strong>Blood For the Earth</strong> at will. This is an
area 2/range 10 attack that deals light physical damage, inflicts ongoing
damage, and gives 5 temporary HP to any allies caught in the area.</p>

<p>This makes for an artillery threat that starts off fairly aggressive and
switches to more of a support role as the fight proceeds.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Spriggans are fairly good at fulfilling the “small evil fey” niche, and I love
the ties to fomorian lore. There are some good synergies between the stat blocks
presented here,</p>

<p>Spriggans can still be found working for fomorians, but some also work for evil
eladrin or run their own rackets. They keep dangerous plants and animals around
their settlements for protection.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 9: an evil eladrin twilight incanter with a pet
shambling mound and a quartet of spriggan goons (2 giantsouls, 2 witherers).</p>

            <p>If there’s one thing that D&amp;D doesn’t lack, it’s monstrous spiders. The Monster
Manual gave us a bunch of them; the Monster Vault would update some of these and
add new ones. The Monster Manual 2, published between those two books, adds a
whole new batch that doesn’t overlap with either of the other books.</p>

<p>All of the spiders here have Tremorsense 10 and a climb speed enhanced by the
Spider Climb trait, which allows them to walk on ceilings. They also have a Web
Walker trait that allows them to ignore difficult terrain caused by
webs. Finally, they have the very obvious Spider keyword, which allows them to
be affected by all those drow and ettercap abilities that benefit “spider
allies”.</p>

<h2 id="bristle-spider">Bristle Spider</h2>

<figure class="center">

<p>These elephant-sized arachnids were originally bred by oni to serve as their
mounts. In our narrative present, several other peoples have adopted them as
well. Their biggest fans are the ettercap and the drow, neither of which have
ever met a spider monster they didn’t like.</p>

<p>Bristle spiders can also be found in the wild, where they inhabit dense jungles
and caves. These environments tend to have enough cover to allow even these huge
monsters to hide effectively and ambush their prey.</p>

<p>Bristle Spiders are Huge Natural Beasts, and Level 15 Elite Lurkers with 232
HP. They have a ground speed of 8 and a climb speed of 6. I don’t know if they
make webs themselves, but they still have Web Walker. As lurkers, they’re
trained in Stealth.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a venomous <strong>Bite</strong> that deals damage with slow and
ongoing poison damage riders. They can also spit an <strong>Acidic Poison Spray</strong> in a
Close Blast 5. This targets reflex and deals both instant and ongoing “acid and
poison” damage, and also slows.</p>

<p>Those bristles are also useful in combat as part of the <strong>Bristle Blast</strong> attack
(recharge 4+). This is a minor action, Close Blast 5 attack against
Fortitude. It deals no damage, but a hit blinds and dazes the target for a turn.</p>

<p>Despite being an elite, the bristle spider lacks a double attack
ability. Instead it relies on its at-will acidic poison blast to hit multiple
PCs per attack, with a side order of bristles to keep them vulnerable. It would
probably work better as an elite controller than an elite lurker, with more HP
and better AC.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 14 and has a bristle spider acting as a palanquin
for a drow priestess and her drow blademaster bodyguard.</p>

<h2 id="phase-spider">Phase Spider</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-spider-phase.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A returning classic, Phase Spiders have undergone some changes to account for
the absence of an Ethereal plane in 4e. Here, they’re fey spiders with innate
teleportation powers. They were originally created by the eladrin as biological
weapons meant to infiltrate the halls of the drow and wreak havoc inside. It’s a
spider arms race!</p>

<p>These spiders can survive nearly anywhere as long as they have prey to
hunt. Their favorite targets are fey creatures, to the extent that they’ll go
after the fey members of a mixed-origin party even if a non-fey target would be
more advantageous. This behavior was probably an attempt by eladrin wizards to
get them to go after drow. You can imagine how that turned out.</p>

<p>Phase Spiders are Large Fey Beasts, and Level 8 Skirmishers with 87 HP. They
have ground, climb, and <em>teleport</em> speeds of 6. Good luck pinning them down.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bites</strong> deal somewhat low damage, but have a dangerous rider: targets
are initially slowed, but after the first failed save they become
unconscious. This is also a (save ends) condition, but the victim is completely
unable to act while it lasts <em>and</em> is even more vulnerable to attack than if
they were “just” stunned.</p>

<p><strong>Ethereal Bite</strong> allows the spider to teleport 10 squares and make a bite
attack, working as a good ambush starter. <strong>Ethereal Repulsion</strong> is an interrupt
that triggers when an enemy moves adjacent to the spider: it attacks their Will
and teleports them 4 squares on a hit.</p>

<p>This makes ranged attacks the best way to deal with phase spiders. They, in
turn, will eagerly teleport to the party’s back line and munch on the squishies,
relying on Ethereal Repulsion to delay any rescue by the melee defenders.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 7 and features two eladrin fey knights leading a
pack of three trained phase spiders.</p>

<h2 id="tomb-spider">Tomb Spider</h2>

<figure class="center">

</figure>

<p>These rotund arachnids are a Shadowfell species that has particularly strong
incentives to seek out passages into the world. Their lifecycle requires them to
lay eggs inside corpses, so they seek out crypts and graveyards for use as
breeding grounds.</p>

<p>When the eggs hatch they animate the corpse, which acts as ambulatory shelter
for the hatchlings until it finally splits open and lets them out. Orcus
cultists just looove tomb spiders, as do all other types of death-themed
villain.</p>

<p>Tomb Spiders are Large Shadow Beasts, and Level 11 Elite Controllers with 226
HP. They have Resist 10 Necrotic, along with ground and climb speeds of 6. Their
<strong>bites</strong> damage, daze, and inflict ongoing necrotic damage (save ends
both). Someone bitten by the spider can’t use the Second Wind action until the
end of the encounter, though they can still be healed by other means.</p>

<p>These spiders definitely to spin webs: they can shoot <strong>Web Nets</strong> at single
targets as a minor action (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex). A hit restrains the target and
makes them vulnerable to necrotic damage until they pass a save. Less often,
they can squeeze out a glob of <strong>Webbed Terrain</strong> (recharge 5+), which affects a
large area and immobilizes on a hit. Hit or miss, the webs remain as difficult
terrain until the end of the encounter.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 11 and features a deatphriest of orcus leading 2
battle wights and 3 cultists to battle, using the tomb spider as armored
support.</p>

<h2 id="tomb-spider-broodswarm">Tomb Spider Broodswarm</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-spider-tomb-broodswarm.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a swarm of tiny tomb spiders that has just burst out of their corpse
nest. It’s a Medium Shadow Beast (Swarm), and counts as a Level 10 Lurker with
84 HP. It has the standard spider traits from this entry, and the standard swarm
traits of being resistant to melee and ranged attacks, and vulnerable to area
attacks.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura (1) slows those caught inside. Its <strong>Swarm of Bites</strong>
attack is a lesser version of mommy’s bite, and instead of attacking it can use
<strong>Shadow Drift</strong> (recharge 5+) to shift shift 5 squares and gain +4 to all
defenses for a turn.</p>

<p>There are no stats for the undead corpse that houses the spiders, but you can
probably use something like a non-royal mummy described as being wrapped in webs
instead of linen wraps. Depending on your tastes, it could be a minion that
disgorges a Broodswarm when killed, a <em>regular</em> that does the same (and thus
counts as an elite two-stage monster), or a regular reskinned mummy if you want
the young swarm to die when it dies instead of bursting out.</p>

<p>No sample encounter here, as the adult tomb spider used the space for it.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I kinda like the phase and tomb spider mechanics… but in the end, it’s more
spiders. By the end of the edition we’ll end up with enough spider variants that
you’ll have one for every situation, but you should definitely not use all of
them in the same campaign.</p>

<p>Sphinxes already made their 4e debut on the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/12/27/sphinx.html">Monster Manual</a>, and the MM2
gives us an additional variant.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore-of-the-sphinx-mystery">The Lore of the Sphinx Mystery</h2>

<p>All sphinxes have a common origin as sacred guardian beasts, as described in the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/12/27/sphinx.html">Monster Manual entry</a>, but not all of them are exactly alike. This stat
block represents an individual with preferences and abilities different from
those of the typical MM1 sphinx.</p>

<p>All sphinxes have the ability to propose challenges that help separate intruders
from visitors who have a right to be at the places they guard. Riddles are a
classic but are far from the only option, and the MM1 entry made some effort to
stress that part. Here, though, we go the other way.</p>

<p>The Sphinx Mystery is an individual who’s <em>way</em> into riddles. She doesn’t just
use them as her basic authentication scheme: she also uses them as weapons in
the middle of an actual fight. She likes riddle games so much that she might
just choose to keep playing rather than fighting with lethal intent, if her
opponents can keep the game fun for her.</p>

<p>Intruders who can’t answer those riddles are in real trouble, though, because
they do real damage and are as sticky as warlock curses.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The Sphinx Mystery is a Level 19 Brute with 224 HP. Despite being a regular, she
still has an action point. This might be an editorial error, but it’s fun so I’d
keep it. She also has low-light vision, and moves at ground and air speeds of 6.</p>

<p>Most of her attacks are part of the standard lion beast arsenal. The likely
fight-opener is a a <strong>Terrifying Roar</strong> (encounter) that targets Fortitude,
deals thunder damage, pushes 5 squares, and knocks prone. Her basic attack are
<strong>Ancient Claws</strong> that do heavy damage, and she can also use a <strong>Bite
of Ages</strong> that deals light damage, knocks prone, and immobilizes with the weight
of history (save ends).</p>

<p>As a minor action, the Mystery can use <strong>Riddle Me This</strong> (Ranged 10). This is
an at-will ability that represents the sphinx compelling someone to solve a
riddle. This “hits” automatically, and dazes the target until the riddle is
answered or until the encounter ends. Answering the riddle requires spending a
minor action and succeeding at a DC 25 History check. Anyone can attempt the
test on their turn, not just the affected PC.</p>

<p>If the targetted PC doesn’t attempt to solve the riddle on their turn, they take
2d8 psychic damage at the end of that turn. They also take this damage if
someone else answers the riddle for them. This damage is light, but about in
line with the amount of “traditional” ongoing damage an effect at this level
would cause.</p>

<p>Note that the target will be dazed, which means that if they attempt to answer
the riddle, that’s the only thing they can do on their turn. So it might be
better to let an unaffected buddy answer it and eat a single instance of that
psychic damage.</p>

<p>The Mystery’s last attack is the amusingly named <strong>Corrective Maul</strong>, which is a
claw attack that does even more damage and recharges whenever anyone fails to
answer one of her riddles.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The riddle mechanic is awesome! It makes the sphinx very controllery despite her
being a Brute. Since the riddle is ranged, you’ll want to delay her entry into
melee combat a bit until she can apply it to every PC. As a regular monster, the
sphinx will always be found alongside a few buddies, so they can help with that.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 16: 2 nothic cacklers, 2 savage minotaurs, and a
sphinx mystery. This is either an evil sphinx running with other assorted
marauders, or a more traditional guardian who has managed to recruit several
would-be intruders to her service through riddles and bets.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I think Slaughterstone Constructs first appeared on the D&amp;D Miniatures game in
late 3e. Their naming style marks them as a construct created after the
“(Material) Golem” namespace had been mostly exhausted.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The approach to an underground dwarf fortress usually consists of a number of
narrow tunnels, and that’s where most of the fighting happens when these places
are attacked. Tunnel fighting is a nasty affair, particularly when it’s two
large armies going at it. No place to run, no place to hide. Each inch of ground
is bought with lives, and when you advance you step on the bodies of foe and
friend alike.</p>

<p>Slaughterstone Constructs are the dwarven answer to this problem. They’re
defensive siege engines built for the singular purpose of making sure the only
ones who die are the invaders. Their intended usage is that you set them loose
on a tunel and watch them run through it while turning everyone inside into
chunky salsa. Their extreme toughness and strength means not many armies can
stand up to them even in a more open field.</p>

<p>Creating a proper slaughterstone construct is quite difficult. To sculpt the
body, you need a solid block of stone upon which the blood of a hero has been
shed. Even if you have that stone, only the very best dwarf artificers can turn
it into a construct. You’ll only find these things defending the largest and
wealthiest dwarven kingdoms, or other places that have good relationships with
them.</p>

<p>Note that the blood requirement doesn’t mean you need to <em>sacrifice</em> a hero on
the stone block. You could cut the stone from a cave or tunnel where that hero
has fought. Alternatively, if your GM likes this sort of technically correct
solution you could get yourself a brand new stone block and ask a certified war
hero to prick their finger and let a drop of blood fall on it. Neither of these
methods is easy (heroes don’t grow on trees!) but they’re far more ethical than
sapient sacrifice.</p>

<p>If you have neither a master artisan nor a source of heroic blood but you still
want your blender tank, you can pay a middling craftsdwarf for a knockoff that’s
less reliable but still pretty strong.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three varieties of slaughterstone constructs here. Two “genuine” models
and a knockoff. All of them are Large Natural Animates with the Construct
keyword. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 6, and the ability to squeeze
into Medium passages without any penalties and without granting combat
advantage. They’re immune to poison, disease, and sleep.</p>

<p>Their Int is 1, the worst possible score, but you don’t need more than that when
your only two functions are “walk forward” and “kill”. They probably respond to
commands of equivalent complexity like “stop killing” and “go back to your
garage”.</p>

<h3 id="slaughterstone-eviscerator">Slaughterstone Eviscerator</h3>

<p>Eviscerators are armed with a large number of whirling scythe blades, and look
a bit like super-edgy stone mantids. They’re Level 18 Brutes with 212 HP. The
blades never stop moving, and to model that they have a <strong>Whirling Blades</strong> aura
(2) that deals 10 damage to anyone caught inside.</p>

<p>As weapons, those blades are are Reach 2 and have the High Crit property. Their
basic attack deals heavy damage to a single target, and they can also be used in
a <strong>Whirling Bladestorm</strong> (recharge 6+) that hits everyone in a Close Burst 2
for average damage. This makes them as dangerous in the open as in a tunnel.</p>

<h3 id="slaughterstone-hammerer">Slaughterstone Hammerer</h3>

<p>These are more robust than eviscerators and mount stone hammers instead of
blades. Once they reach you, it’s really hard to get away from them. Hammerers
are Level 25 Soldiers with 233 HP.</p>

<p>They project a <strong>Thunder Step</strong> aura (2) that slows those caught inside. The
hammers can be used in two different attacks: a basic <strong>Slam</strong> that deals
average damage and knocks prone, and a <strong>Hammerstrike</strong> that deals the same
damage and dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>None of the hammerer’s skills mark enemies, but if you use them properly enemies
will have no option but to attack the hammerer anyway.</p>

<h3 id="slaughterstone-slicer">Slaughterstone Slicer</h3>

<p>This is our “knockoff”, described as a less powerful version of a genuine
eviscerator. It’s a Level 11 Elite Brute with 276 HP.</p>

<p>Slicers have pretty much the same attacks and traits as eviscerators, with
smaller numbers due to the level difference. Their Bladestorm is supposed to be
an encounter power that recharges when the slicer is first bloodied, despite the
“at-will” tag on it.</p>

<p>They also have a tendency to malfunction, becoming dazed for a turn after they
either deal or take a critical hit.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Fourth Edition’s combat rules make these constructs even more dangerous than the
lore indicates. Both the lore and the rules say a construct “plugs” a tunnel and
prevents enemies from passing through. The rules also say that allies may freely
move and attack through each others’ spaces.</p>

<p>This means slaughterstone constructs pair really well with artillery monsters,
and with controllers that have good ranged attacks. They’re also pretty good
with skirmishers who can dart forward, attack, and move behind the construct
again. Even if they can’t do all that in the same turn, their exposure to the
PCs is still reduced.</p>

<p>Our example encounters are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11: 1 duergar blasphemer, 2 duergar fleshtearers, 1 slaughterstone
slicers. Looks like it’s not just dwarves who build these.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: 2 Eldritch Giants, 1 Nothic Mindblight, 2 Slaughterstone
Eviscerators. Maybe they conquered a dwarf fortress and stole the constructs?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 25: 1 Beholder Eye of Chaos, 1 Oni Thunderer, 3 Slaughterstone
Hammerers. This is the “strong artillery”, “mobile skirmisher” setup I
mentioned, in its epic incarnation. You think you’re safe because the corridor
is 6 squares wide, and then you see three constructs side by side blocking all
of it.</p>
