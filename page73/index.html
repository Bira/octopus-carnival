<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Evistros are also known as “Carnage Demons”, and they’re all about the
carnage. These man-sized demons have red skin, needle-like teeth, digitigrade
legs and large black claws on both their hands and feet. In other words, they
look pretty much like two-armed Blood Fiends. While 4e Blood Fiends aren’t
technically demons, I think the above description already provides sufficient
justification for a GM to make them so, should they be so inclined. Evistros are
only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<p>Anyway, when left to their own devices these things gather in huge hordes and
rampage through whatever plane they happen to be in. Cultists and evil wizards
find it easy to summon them into the world, but have a much harder time
controlling them or getting them to do anything other than rampaging.
Particularly inept summoners are often the first victims of their summoned
evistros.</p>

<p>Carnage Demons are Medium Elemental Magical Beasts, and Level 6 Brutes with 90
HP. This means they are likely some of the first demons a PC party will run
into during their careers. They charge at you with Speed 6, and have variable
resistance 10 (1/encounter). They can’t see in the dark at all, so you have that
going for you if you meet one in a dark alley.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a claw, and they also have a slightly weaker bite they can
use as a minor action on a bloodied target. They also have a passive ability
called Carnage: if the demon has an ally adjacent to its target, it gains +1 on
the attack roll. The bonus becomes +3 if that ally is also a carnage demon.</p>

<p>As it happens with a lot of monsters in this book, the evistro’s tactics write
themselves: these demons always come in bands; they charge all at once, focus on
a single target, and tear it to pieces. Rinse (in blood) and repeat
forever. Quite fitting for an Int 5 demon.</p>

<p>The two suggested encounters are both level 6. The first is 3 evistros and 2
gnolls, which makes sense because their temperaments match perfectly. The second
is 4 evistros and one harpy, which is a bit more puzzling. Is the harpy a
demonologist?</p>

<p>I was totally unimpressed by these things when I started reading the monster
entry, but now that I’m through I think they’re kinda cool as an introduction to
demon opponents. They just need the standard damage fix and you’re good to go.</p>

<p>At higher levels, you can make them into minions and have dozens of the things
swarming all around the battlefield as the party tries to fight their more
powerful demon bosses.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>We continue our tour of the Abyss with the Barlgura, which looks basically like
a demonic orangutan with wicked claws and fangs. I guess these have been part of
D&amp;D for a while, but my first contact with them in published material was the
excellent adventure <em>Heathen</em>, from Dungeon 155, which (spoilers!) featured a
solo version of the barlgura as the ultimate villain.</p>

<p>The lore for them is a bit sparse, but we do get a bit saying they’re favored by
Demogorgon and their presence can be a sign that a cult of that demon lord is
active in the area.</p>

<p>These are only on the Monster Manual: the Demon entry on the vault concerns
itself strictly with Paragon-or-higher-tier opposition.</p>

<p>The barlgura is a Large Elemental Beast (demon), though I believe it was
mistyped and should be a Magical Beast since it’s sapient. It’s still not very
smart, at Int 6. Anyway, it’s a Level 8 Brute with 108 HP.</p>

<p>Balrguras have low-light vision and variable resistance 10 (1/encounter). They
have ground and climb speeds of 8. They attack with a slam that’s kinda weak by
itself, but since they can make two of those despite not being elite their
damage lines up with the expected for their level. When bloodied, it lets out a
Savage Howl as a free action, giving itself and any allies within 5 squares +2
to all attacks for a turn.</p>

<p>This is not a complicated monster: it will charge ahead and try to pummel the
closest victim with its simian fists.</p>

<p>We get two suggested encounters for them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 9, 1 barlgura and a mixed party of 7 gnolls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11, 4 barlguras, 2 minotaur warriors, and 1 minotaur cabalist.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So despite being favored by Demogorgon, they can also be found along cultists of
Yeenoghu and Baphomet. What are you gonna do, tell the 10-foot orangutan from
the Abyss it can’t do that?</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I would probably not have given these apes a second thought if it hadn’t been
for <em>Heathen</em>. If you’re looking for a positive example of early 4e adventure
writing, you can’t go wrong with that one. It can easily be turned into a
mini-campaign, and is certainly leagues above Keep on the Shadowfell.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual lists demons in alphabetic order, and the Vault lists them by
level. Since we’re using the Monster Manual as our guide here, let’s examine
them alphabetically. Doing this means our first demon is the one right at the
top of their “monster ladder”: the Balor.</p>

<p>Let’s be real here: Balors are Balrogs. They were even named Balrogs back in the
oldest days of D&amp;D, before the Tolkien estate complained. They look like
towering red-skinned humanoids with horrible fanged and horned horse heads,
shaggy black manes, and bat wings. They wield huge flaming swords and whips. So
yeah, Balrogs.</p>

<p>Here Balors command large hordes of lesser demons, who all fear being torn apart
by them. Balors often answer directly to the demon lords in turn, though some of
them stake out some territory of their own to rule as princelings, answering to
no one. You can sometimes find balors bound against their will to ancient places
in the deepest reaches of the natural world, just waiting for some fool of a Tûk
to wake them up.</p>

<p>Since we have a whole post just for them, let’s discuss the MM and MV versions
separately!</p>

<h2 id="balor-monster-manual">Balor (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The Balor is a Huge Elemental Humanoid (demon). Anything with the “demon”
keyword is officially a demon, and also doesn’t need to sleep. It’s also a Level
27 Elite Brute with 624 HP and higher defenses than its role and level would
indicate. In combat they like to focus on a single opponent to the exclusion of
all else - yes, they’ll trip your defender’s mark punishment like no one else,
but they can take it. These demons very rarely retreat. So if you were wondering
why the PCs would ever need access to their own colossus ally, here’s your
answer.</p>

<p>Balors have truesight 6, are immune to fear, have Resist 40 fire and Resist 20
variable (3/encounter). That last bit means the balor can change what element
that resistence 20 applies to as a free action up to 3 times per
encounter. Variable resistance is a demon signature trait in 4e, and I prefer it
over having to memorize that long list of resistances and immunities from
previous editions. It also prevents PCs from just loading up with sonic damage
and ignoring all of that as well.</p>

<p>It also has a Flaming Body: an aura 2 that does 10 fire damage to any enemy that
starts its turn inside it. When the balor is bloodied, the aura’s size increases
to 3 and the damage increases to 20.</p>

<p>The balor walks with Speed 8 and flies with Speed 12 (clumsy). It would have
some trouble taking off midair if Gandalf threw it off a bridge.</p>

<p>Balors fight with a sword made of lightning (range 3) and a whip made of fire
(range 5). The sword is its basic attack and does lightning damage with the High
Crit property. The whip targets Reflex and does both instant and ongoing fire
damage. The monster can attack with both in a single standard action, and the
“tactics” section says it will use its action point to attack again as soon as
it hits the same target with both weapons. Both of them suffer from the usual
math bugs.</p>

<p>As a free action the balor can call upon its Demonic Accuracy, which allows it
to reroll a missed attack with a +5 bonus to hit. When it dies, it explodes,
subjecting everyone in a close burst 10 to an attack against Reflex that does a
somewhat underwhelming 7d10 fire damage, half on a miss.</p>

<p>As you’d expect, Balors are Chaotic Evil. They speak Abyssal and Common and are
trained in Perception, Bluff, Insight and Intimidate. Their Int is 12, which is
pretty good but not “mastermind” level. Just goes to show you brawn is more
valuable than brains when it comes to rising through the ranks of the Abyss,
such as they are.</p>

<h2 id="balor-monster-vault">Balor (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The Monster Vault balor is also a Huge Elemental Humanoid (demon) and a Level 27
Elite Brute. Its defenses are in line with its role and level, and it has 622
HP.</p>

<p>While the MV Balor maintains the Flaming Body aura, all of its other passive
traits are pretty different. It replaces truesight 6 with blindsight 6 and
darkvision, which are more useful when you think about it. Its fire resistance
is down to 20, but it keeps the variable resistance to other elements. This is
now listed among its Triggered Actions, at the end of the stat block, which
tripped me up for a second.</p>

<p>The damage of its Death Burst actually went <em>down</em>, from 7d10 to 6d10, but it
more than makes up for this with the damage of its other attacks. The sword went
from 2d10+10 to 6d10+11 while <em>still</em> being High Critical. That’s 7d10+71
lightning damage on a critical! The whip underwent a more modest increase (3d8+5
to 2d10+10), but its ongoing damage also went up from 5 to 15. The MV Balor can
still attack with both weapons using a single standard action.</p>

<p>It also gains a new attack named Beheading Blade, an encounter power that
recharges when it’s bloodied. It’s an attack with the sword that does around 30%
more lightning damage than the basic version, crits on 15-20, and is also High
Critical. Yikes!</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The Balor definitely looks like something that was on the level of a demigod
before it was corrupted by evil. I remember that balors in previous editions had
tons of spell-like abilities that ended up being its main way of fighting, but
it feels like 4e did a good job of making them impressive physical threats like
they’re supposed to be.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault update is hands-down the best of the two, so you should
definitely use that if you have both books. It’s actually punching a bit above
its (already impressive) weight class in terms of damage.</p>

<p>Both versions even have somewhat decent ability to counter ranged attackers,
since their own attacks have a very long reach. Plus nothing prevents it from
bringing in some artillery support.</p>

<p>I notice these 4e stat blocks lack the infamous ability to summon other demons,
which is understandable because accounting for it when building encounters was a
big hassle. If you want the flavor of it, though, you can simply build an
encounter with a balor and several other demons and describe the others as being
summoned when the fight starts.</p>

<p>Speaking of encounters, the sample one in the MM is level 26: one balor, 1
thunderblast cyclone elemental, and 2 efreet pyresingers. It’s likely these two
efreet wizards have managed to bind a balor, because I can’t really see the
relationship going the other way.</p>

            <p>Strap yourselves in, because we’re in for a huuuge multi-entry. So huge, in
fact, that this post is just an introduction to it, and each individual demon
will get their own.</p>

<p>To understand the what 4e demons are like, we have to talk a bit about the
cosmology of D&amp;D 4th Edition, which is significantly different than that of
previous editions.</p>

<p>Fourth Edition’s cosmology has been nicknamed the World Axis, because it’s more,
well, vertical than the wheel-shaped Great Wheel of earlier editions. You have
the World at the center, with its fey and shadow echoes to either side. You have
the Astral Sea above, and the Elemental Chaos below. We’re focusing on that last
one here.</p>

<p>The concept of the Elemental Chaos is that you take all the elemental planes
which used to be separate and make them the same place. It’s the natural home of
both traditional elementals and what used to be called “quasi-“ and “para-“
elementals back in the AD&amp;D days. It’s also the home of the Primordials, titanic
elemental beings who came into existence at the dawn of time and decided to
create the world just for kicks. They would eventually get a bit tired of it,
and begin thinking of destroying the whole thing and building something else.</p>

<p>The gods came into existence in a similar way up there in the Astral Sea, and
when they saw the world they quite liked it. They went to war with the
Primordials to stop them from unmaking the world - angels and archons, which we
already saw, were the rank-and-file soldiers in this Dawn War.</p>

<p>Now, legend has it that long before even the Dawn War, there was this god named
Tharizdun. He saw the other gods and thought it would be swell if he was lord
over them all. He roamed to the ends of the universe looking for a way to do
that, and somewhere out there he found a tiny shard of ultimate evil. Tharizdun
wasn’t a nice fellow even before touching the shard, but after he did that he
was completely corrupted.</p>

<p>So he took the shard to the deepest part of the Elemental Chaos and planted it
there like a seed. This seed sprouted and swallowed everything around it like an
expanding black hole. Everything and everyone in there was completely
corrupted. Tharizdun tried to lead an army of corrupted elementals out of that
cyst of evil to conquer, well, everything, but the other gods banded together to
stop him and seal him up in a place only they knew. They couldn’t destroy the
cyst, though, so it remained.</p>

<p>This cyst is the Abyss. The corrupted elementals are Demons. Demons don’t belong
in the cosmology the way elementals or even Primordials do. Demons are <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>Demons don’t want wealth or power. They have no use for the souls of mortals and
don’t care about corrupting them. Demons only want to destroy as much as
possible before they themselves are destroyed and reborn in the Abyss to do it
again. They only organize through intimidation and brute force, with stronger
demons bullying weaker ones into servitude. Visually, they’re all terrifying
monsters. The one whose looks are closest to those of a person has six arms and
and the lower body of a snake.</p>

<p>The strongest demons are the Demon Princes, primordials who were caught in the
Abyss when it formed and were corrupted. They include a lot of the classic
“usual suspects” of D&amp;D: Orcus, Demogorgon, Baphomet… There’s also Lolth, a
goddess who became kind of an honorary archdemon after she moved into a region
of the Abyss called the Demonweb Pits. It’s quite likely the influence of the
Seed of Evil has corrupted her as much as it did Tharizdun.</p>

<p>Demon Prince-level baddies get their own separate entries: the Demon entry is
for the non-unique monsters beneath them, which can still be quite badass
themselves. The next posts will cover these.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault has several demons that don’t show up in the Monster
Manual. That’s because these particular demons show up in the Monster Manual 2
and 3! They are: the abyssal eviscerator, the babau and the dretch. Since they
<em>do</em> show up on the Monster Vault, I’ll talk about them using information from
those later Manuals after I’m done with the MM demons.</p>

<p>At last we come to another iconic D&amp;D monster! If you’re following VoidDrifter’s
RPG.net thread on the Dragon Magazine monster articles, you can read about the
history of Death Knights in the game <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/lets-read-4e-dragon-dungeon-magazine-monster-articles.840167/post-22345155">here</a>. The article was published before
the Monster Manual came out, so here we finally get to see what 4e Death Knights
look like.</p>

<p>They exist in both the Monster Manual and the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Death Knights share some similarities with liches, in that they’re people who
became undead through a profane ritual so they could live forever. The main
difference here is that they were great warriors instead of potent
spellcasters. The ritual is also a bit different: instead of binding their soul
to a phylactery, it binds it to their favored weapon, which becomes known as
their Soul Weapon.</p>

<p>Death Knights retain the memories and abilities they had in life, but the ritual
distorts their personality into something much nastier than it used to be. Not
that they were all that nice to begin with, of course - becoming a Death Knight
is a choice and the ritual itself is an extremely evil act. Still, it’s common
for their to retain a twisted version of whatever code of honor they followed
before. Maybe a Death Knight will wax poetic about how it fell from grace while
it guts you.</p>

<p>You can expect them to always be superlative combatants and have great skill at
leading troops. Even nonsapient skeletons become more dangerous under the
command of a Death Knight.</p>

<p>If you manage to disarm them of their soul weapon, they become dazed and
weakened, though anyone else who holds the weapon suffers the same
effects. Destroying the weapon is useless - the knight can restore it with a
touch. There’s no shortcut to destroying a Death Knight: you have to defeat them
in combat. When they fall their soul weapons lose their special properties.</p>

<p>The ritual for turning someone into a death knight comes from Orcus
himself. The agents of Orcus seek out legendary warriors who are reaching the
end of their lives and tempt them with immortality. Others seek the ritual of
their own volition.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>“Death Knight” is actually a <em>monster template</em>, the first we’ve ran into
here. The way 4e templates work is that they make a regular monster Elite and
add a suite of thematic powers. You can technically add two templates together
to make a Solo as well, with a few modifications to the process.</p>

<p>The detailed rules for adding HP and defenses from the template to a monster are
a bit awkward. In practice, you’re better off making an Elite or Solo monster
from scratch with the traits from the templates you want. We get two example
Death Knights here, both of which have MM and MV versions.</p>

<h3 id="death-knight-human-fighter">Death Knight (Human Fighter)</h3>

<p>Called just a “Death Knight” by the Monster Vault, this dapper fellow is a Level
17 Elite Soldier. The MM version has 264 HP, but the MV one has 324. In both
cases it has darkvision, Resist 10 necrotic, and Vulnerable 10 Radiant, and
moves with Speed 5 due to its heavy armor.</p>

<p>Power-wise, there’s quite a bit of ground to cover, so we’ll list things in the
MV order, by action type.</p>

<p>The Death Knight has a passive trait called Marshal Undead, which gives any
undead allies of level 17 or less within 10 squares of the knight a +2 to all
attacks.</p>

<p>It attacks with its Soulsword, which in the MM does a mix of physical and
necrotic damage plus extra necrotic damage on a hit. In the MV, it does a whole
bunch of necrotic damage and marks the target for a turn even on a miss.</p>

<p>It can also use the sword to perform a Containing Strike, which is like the
basic attack above but allows the knight to make a free attack against the
target if they try to shift until the end of the next turn. The MM version is
single-target, the MV version can target 1 or 2 creatures, making this the
monster’s basic Elite multiattack ability.</p>

<p>Oncer per encounter it can use Warrior’s Challenge, which I believe is a Fighter
power. It does encounter-power-level damage, pushes the target 2 squares, and
marks every enemy within 2 squares of the target at the end of the push.</p>

<p>Finally, on a recharge 5-6, it can unleash Unholy Flames in a Close Burst 2,
which does a heap of necrotic damage to enemies and gives 2d6 extra fire damage
to the attacks of any undead allies for a turn.</p>

<p>The MM Death Knight also has a Second Wind it can use once per encounter to
recover 66 HP. So that’s why tie MM version has less HP!</p>

<p>The Death Knight can punish marked targets like a fighter.</p>

<p>The MV version has one other triggered action: Implacable, which lets it make an
immediate save against being marked, slowed, dazed, immobilized, or
stunned. This means all of those effects have only a 40% chance of actually
landing unless the party can try to apply them multiple times in a turn.</p>

<p>This monster works really well as the commander of an undead unit, and the
suggested encounter features just that: Level 16, a death knight, 2 abyssal
ghouls, and 2 sword wraiths. Perhaps these were the knight’s old subordinates,
made into undead servitors as part of the ritual that transformed it.</p>

<h3 id="death-knight-blackguard">Death Knight Blackguard</h3>

<p>This MV-only variant is a Level 18 Elite Skirmisher with 338 HP. It mainly shows
the advantage of dropping the somewhat rigid structure of templates and making
your own monsters from scratch using them as guidelines.</p>

<p>It has the same darkvision and resistances as the classic Death Knight above,
and exchanges Marshal Undead with Slayer of the Living, an Aura 3 that slides
any enemy who ends its turn in the aura 3 squares. A handy tool for drawing in
the squishies while keeping the defenders away.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is still the Soulsword, which here allows the knight to shift 2
squares before or after the attack instead of marking. It can use this attack
twice in a turn, against different enemies.</p>

<p>It can also choose to do an at-will Overpowering Attack against 1 or 2 enemies,
which slides <em>them</em> instead of shifting the knight.</p>

<p>The Blackguard possesses an Abyssal Blast encounter power that targets Reflex
and does a heap of fire and necrotic damage to enemies in a Close Burst 5, or
half damage on a miss.</p>

<p>As a minor action, it can use Chilling Glare to make one enemy within 5 squares
automatically grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>And finally, the Blackguard is just as Implacable as the MV Death Knight.</p>

<p>Yeah, keeping any sort of formation while one of these is on the field is a
hopeless endeavor. It becomes even more dangerous when paired with a classic
death knight and a few other lesser undead, preferably ones that do nasty things
if they get combat advantage, which it can give out freely.</p>

<h3 id="death-knight-dragonborn-paladin">Death Knight (Dragonborn Paladin)</h3>

<p>This MM-only variant is a Level 25 Elite Soldier with 373 HP (466 if you add the
Second Wind). It has darkvision, Resist 15 necrotic, and Vulnerable 15 radiant.</p>

<p>This Death Knight combines many of the powers of the classic model (which come
from the template) with a few paladin-like attacks. This means it has the same
Marhsal Undead aura and Unholy Flames burst. Being an MM-only monster it lacks
Implacable.</p>

<p>Aside from the basic soulsword attack, it can use the Valiant Strike at-will
power that gives it an extra +1 to the attack roll per adjacent enemy. It also
has a Terrifying Smite encounter power that does extra damage, pushes the target
5 squares and prevents it from moving closer to the knight for a turn.</p>

<p>Its mark power is the paladin’s Divine Challenge, which lasts until the knight
marks someone else and does a bit of automatic necrotic damage to targets that
flout the mark.</p>

<p>This death knight features in the second suggested encounter of the Monster
Manual entry, which is level 24 and has it accompanied by a fell wyvern, a great
flameskull and a bunch of abyssal ghoul minions. It’s something you can expect
when raiding Orcus’s neighborhood in the Abyss.</p>

<p>I can see why they fixed the paladin’s mark in Divine Power, and why they
dropped much of the fiddly bits for adding templates. Not having any multiattack
ability makes it a little less effective than an elite monster of its level
should be. The lack of Implacable is also keenly felt. This is a bit
disappointing since we’re probably looking at someone who had a direct hand in
the fall of Arkhosia.</p>
