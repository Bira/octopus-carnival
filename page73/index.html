            <p>Fomorians first appeared in the first Monster Manual, and we covered them
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/07/fomorian.html">here</a>. This entry gives us more fomorian stat blocks, and a few more bits of
lore.</p>

<p>First, we have a bit of general lore, which is really a logical extension of the
fact that Fomorians believe themselves the most important creatures in the
universe. They hate all other fey, but that hate manifests as a desire to
subjugate rather than exterminate them. Their perfect world is one where
fomorians rule absolute over the Feywild and have all its other inhabitants
forever toiling to please their masters.</p>

<p>Because of this obsession, fomorians are eternally at war with the other fey
civilizations. It’s likely they’ll never succeed in conquering all of the
Feywild, but they’ll never stop trying either. I suppose there must also be some
level of internecine strife among them, because it seems to be they’re very
likely to fight over who gets to be supreme ruler.</p>

<p>The remaining bits of lore concern the individual stat blocks here, and so will
be covered in those stat blocks.</p>

<p>Numbers-wise, fomorians still retain their common traits from the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/07/fomorian.html">first
article</a>: they’re Huge Fey Humanoids with the Giant keyword; they’re
extremely perceptive (trained Perception, Truesight 6); and they have some sort
of “evil eye” ability that varies per stat block.</p>

<h2 id="fomorian-ghost-shaman">Fomorian Ghost Shaman</h2>

<figure class="center">

<p>Ghost shamans are necromancers who enslave the spirits of those they kill. They
command these spirits as if they were puppets, enacting sadistic plays for their
own amusement. They also use enslaved spirits as weapons in combat.</p>

<p>Ghost shamans are Level 16 Elite Controllers with 312 HP. They have darkvision
in addition to the other fomorian traits. All of their attacks are magical in
nature and, except for the Evil Eye, target Fortitude. Their basic melee attack
is <strong>Death’s Touch</strong>, which deals necrotic damage and slows (save ends). Their
<strong>Evil Eye</strong> is a minor-action ranged attack that inflicts ongoing necrotic
damage (save ends).</p>

<p>At will, they can use <strong>Spirits of Possession</strong> (close blast 3), which targets
people taking ongoing necrotic damage and dominates them on a hit (save ends). A
bit less often they can use <strong>Darksoul Mist</strong>, which is like a necrotic fireball
that leaves a zone of darkness in the affected area. This blocks line of sight
for anyone without darkvision.</p>

<h2 id="fomorian-cackler">Fomorian Cackler</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-fomorian-cackler.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Cacklers are sly but unhinged assassins who get their name because they
constantly laugh a disturbing laugh. They can be silent when they want to be,
though, and are amazingly stealthy for someone the size of a house. They can
also use magic to shrink down to Medium size, which helps a lot.</p>

<p>Cacklers are also excellent at disguising themselves, since their minds can
easily construct entire fake personalities to aid in that. It’s possible for
previously discarded personalities to momentarily come to the fore again,
though, which is part of why they’re so unstable.</p>

<p>They fight with <strong>daggers</strong> bigger than the average human greatsword, which they
can use in melee or throw out to range 10. The thrown dagger attack can target
one or two enemies, and they return after it resolves.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Evil Eye</strong> makes them invisible to the affected enemy, and they get a
big bonus to damage against targets that can’t see them. <strong>Size Alteration</strong>
lets them switch between Huge and Medium as a minor action.</p>

<h2 id="fomorian-totemist">Fomorian Totemist</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-fomorian-totemist.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Totemists are fomorian spellcasters that collect the heads of those they kill
and build chains out of them. Each head in the chain is imbued with necromantic
power, and can channel a different curse. Most totemists have a preference for a
particular type of head - one might favor eladrin heads, another dwarves, and so
on. Some of them select prospective additions to their chains year in advance,
following the lives of their future victims until the time is right for the
“harvest”.</p>

<p>Totemists are Level 18 Elite Skirmishers with 352 HP. They fight with the
afore-mentioned <strong>Chain of Heads</strong>, which is Reach 4, does physical damage and
inflicts ongoing necrotic damage. They can also channel curses through the chain
as a minor action, with an ability with the very unfortunate name of
<strong>Voodoo</strong>. There are three possible effects: the <strong>Glorious Head</strong> blinds, the
<strong>Wasting Head</strong> weakens, and the <strong>Bewildering Head</strong> forces the target to make
a melee basic attack against an ally in reach. After attacking, the totemist can
shift 1 square.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Evil Eye</strong> does light necrotic damage and inflicts a -2 penalty to
saves, which helps that blindness or weakness last longer. And finally we have
<strong>Fresh Rage</strong>, a passive trait that makes their first succesfful attack in
their turn deal extra damage.</p>

<h2 id="fomorian-blinder">Fomorian Blinder</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-fomorian-blinder.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Blinders have more specialized and discerning tastes than totemists. They
collect <em>eyes</em> instead of lugging whole heads around. Blinders are the scholars
and sages of fomorian-kind, acting as repositories of their civilization’s
lore. They’re also very good at eye-based magic - if anyone knows how to make a
defense against the Evil Eye, it’s them.</p>

<p>Blinders are Level 20 Elite Artillery with 296 HP. They use <strong>quarterstaffs</strong>
for melee combat but their forte is eye magic. <strong>Acid Eye</strong> is a ranged attack
that deals acid and necrotic damage, and whose enervating properties prevent the
use of encounter or daily powers for a turn. <strong>Shower of Ichor</strong> (encounter)
deals the same damage over a wider area, and also inflicts ongoing acid and
necrotic damage.</p>

<p>The blinder’s actual <strong>Evil Eye</strong> is quite powerful: it does no damage by
itself, but someone cursed by it will take the same damage the fomorian inflicts
on other enemies with their other attacks. It ends when the victim saves
successfully, or when the fomorian uses this on someone else.</p>

<p>Ironically, blinders have no abilities that actually blind people.</p>

<h2 id="fomorian-butcher">Fomorian Butcher</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-fomorian-butcher.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Butchers are big fomorians with big blades who like to cut people up for
fun. Such simplicity is a bit disappointing after we saw all those esoterically
evil fomorian casters and assassins, but they’re still very dangerous and just
as ambitious. In fact, they go to absurd lengths to fulfill their serial-killer
urges, and will often trade their souls to devils and make other dangerous deals
in exchange for more power.</p>

<p>Butchers are Level 22 Elite Brutes with 514 HP. They use titan-sized
<strong>falchions</strong>, which are High-Crit weapons. They’re all about focusing on a
single victim and hacking them apart with repeated strikes: when they score a
critical, they can make another free attack with the falchion against the same
victim, and their attacks deal a bunch of extra damage against a victim they
already hit earlier in the same turn. Their <strong>Evil Eye</strong> restrains (save ends).</p>

<p>There are several ways they can get that extra damage from a “subsequent” hit:
the bonus attack from a critical, spending an action point to attack again, and
I’d say hitting with the Evil Eye also counts for this. So they’ll always try
that before swinging their blades.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Most of the sample encounters here are “Assorted Fomorians” from this book and
the MM. One of them also involves drow and Lolthbound Goblins. Generally
speaking you can also frequently find fomorians accompanied by cyclops slaves,
or by other evil fey they’ve enslaved or allied with. Devils could also make an
appearance, since it seems Fomorian diabolists are somewhat common.</p>

<p>This lot is quite a bit more flavorful than the fomorians in the MM, and the
extra lore does justice to the basics laid down by the first book. “Voodoo” is a
very unfortunate name for an ability, but it’s easy enough to change.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Firbolgs are inspired by Celtic myth, and I’m sure they must have appeared in
earlier editions in some form. I think their 4e presentation in this book is
new, though.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Firbolgs are giants (not Giants) native to the Feywild. Their culture values
independence and courage, and their religion is a variant of the
Maiden-Mother-Crone triumvirate. This variant has a different goddess in each
role: Sehanine is the Maiden, Melora is the Mother, and the Raven Queen is the
Crone. This generally results in a religion that’s themed around the night, the
moon, autumn and winter, instead of the more balanced “classical” version.</p>

<p>Firbolgs live in and protect the deep wilderness of the Feywild, building their
settlements on precarious peaks, floating earth motes, and other such hazardous
heights. Leadership positions are occupied by their mightiest warriors and their
moon seers (priestesses), both of whom wear masks or helmets styled after one of
their deities. They place great value on clan and family ties.</p>

<p>Back when I discussed the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/05/30/hound.html">Hounds of the Wild Hunt</a>, I speculated that the
hunters would be high-powered eladrin. Well, I was wrong! Turns out the Wild
Hunt is a Firbolg tradition.</p>

<p>You see, while firbolgs are fond of treasure, they place even greater value in
oaths and promises. And when someone breaks an oath made to the firbolgs, they
convene a Wild Hunt to track and punish the infractor. Even people who didn’t
betray the firbolgs directly still have reason to fear them, as there’s a ritual
that allows someone to sic a Wild Hunt on an oathbreaker. And I imagine they
might also ride out to fulfill sacred missions revealed in the moon seers’
visions.</p>

<p>Wild Hunts vary in size and composition, and might include allied sapients whose
goals and temperament are close to those of the firbolgs themselves. The
mightiest and scariest hunts are led by firbolgs with the oficial title of
Master of the Wild Hunt, who usually act as community leaders while not
fulfilling that role.</p>

<p>PCs might find themselves fighting firbolgs when they stumble on their
territory, since a firbolg attack will likely be the first sign that they did
it. They could also find themselves on the path of a Wild Hunt, or even as their
main target if they manage to piss off someone who can convince the Hunt the PCs
are oathbreakers.</p>

<p>Still, it’s possible to negotiate with firbolgs and even approach them
peacefully. The Wild Hunt is harder to parley with, but it’s still not
impossible unless the PCs really are oathbreakers. Of course, should their
interests align, the PCs might find themselves riding alongside the hunters.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Firbolgs are Large Fey Humanoids, and all the ones we see here are
Unaligned. They all have low-light vision and a natural ground speed of 8. They
also have Regeneration 5 (10 at Epic tier), which can be shut down for a turn by
necrotic damage.</p>

<p>They also have a +2 bonus on saves against charm effects, and the immobilized,
slowed and restrained conditions. For elite firbolgs, this stacks with the +2 on
all saves elites get.</p>

<p>Their signature power is <strong>Moonfire</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will; minor action;
recharge 4+), which prevents the target from benefitting from cover or
concealment for a turn. It also has additional effects that vary per stat block,
but all generally make the target more vulnerable to that firbolg’s attacks. All
of their other powers come from martial or magic training, and their magic has
the same themes as their religion.</p>

<h3 id="firbolg-hounder">Firbolg Hounder</h3>

<p>Hounders are members of firbolg hunting parties whose job is to attack and drive
prey into a position that makes them vulnerable to the other hunters. They wear
scale and wield axes and shields. They’re Level 11 Soldiers with 113 HP.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Battleaxe</strong>, and they can use it in a
<strong>Hounding Strike</strong> maneuver that has the same basic stats and also slides the
target 2 squares on a hit. <strong>Drive Prey</strong> is an even more powerful version of
that, doing more damage and allowing a secondary attack vs. Will. If that hits,
the target must move or shift away from the hounder with its first action on its
next turn, or become dazed until the end of that turn. This ability recharges
when the hounder is first bloodied.</p>

<p>At range, the hounder can throw <strong>Handaxes</strong>, which do light physical damage and
knock the target prone. Their <strong>Moonfire</strong> power also marks the target for a
turn. Finally, the <strong>Hunter’s Leap</strong> passive trait makes them immune to
opportunity attacks while jumping. They use the standard jumping rules for that.</p>

<p>So it looks like these firbolgs will use Hounding Strike and Drive Prey to slide
enemies into a vulnerable position, and then either stay away and throw
handaxes, or move into melee to try and keep the enemy pinned in place while the
other hunters do their jobs.</p>

<h3 id="firbolg-hunter">Firbolg Hunter</h3>

<p>These are the people the hounder (above) works with. They’re level 12
Skirmishers with 123 HP, wear light armor and bring <strong>spears</strong> and <strong>javelins</strong>
to bear agains their prey.</p>

<p>All of their powers enhance their weapon attacks. <strong>Crippling Strike</strong>
(recharges when first bloodied) adds extra damage to an attack and makes it
immobilize the target (save ends) with a Slow after-effect. <strong>Mobile Attack</strong>
allows them to move 8 squares and make a basic attack without provoking
opportunity attacks from the target, or from making ranged attacks. Their
<strong>Moonfire</strong> also makes their weapon attacks do +1d6 damage to the affected
target for a turn.</p>

<p>And finally, they also have Hunter’s Leap. It’s really hard to run from them,
particularly when there hounders pinning you down.</p>

<h3 id="firbolg-moon-seer">Firbolg Moon Seer</h3>

<p>Moon Seers are those priestesses I talked about. They’re Level 14 Controllers
with 141 HP. They wear masks and light armor, and fight with moon- and
fate-themed magic.</p>

<p>A seer’s basic melee attack is a <strong>Moon Mace</strong> that targets Reflex, deals
Radiant damage, and blinds the target until the start of its next turn. Their
<strong>Moonfire</strong> has the additional effect of making targets grand combat advantage
to the seer for a turn. After hitting someone with Moonfire, the seer can use
<strong>Moonstrike</strong> (vs. Will) to deal psychic damage to that victim and dominate
them until the end of the seer’s next turn.</p>

<p>There’s two other spells <strong>Spirit Hounds</strong> and <strong>Ban of the Raven</strong>.</p>

<p>Spirit Hounds is a blast that targets Reflex and only affects enemies. It deals
psychic damage, slows, and prevents the target from teleporting (save ends),
which is handy when hunting down eladrin or other fey.</p>

<p>Ban of the Raven is the big gun, an encounter power that’s a Ranged 10
vs. Fortitude attack. It deals heavy necrotic damage and worsens critical hits!
The affected victim takes critical hits on a natural 18-20 instead of only a 20,
and each such hit deals an extra 10 necrotic damage on top of whatever it would
normally deal. Once the victim saves against that there’s still a weaker
aftereffect that makes the victim suffer crits on a 19-20.</p>

<h3 id="firbolg-bloodbear">Firbolg Bloodbear</h3>

<p>Bloodbears mix in a bit of viking into their Celtic trappings, being able to
turn into bear hybrids. They’re Level 15 Elite Brutes with 240 HP.</p>

<p>They fight unarmed, and start out in firbolg form. Once bloodied, they assume
<strong>Bloodbear Form</strong>, recover <em>all of their HP</em>, and double their
regeneration. This also upgrades all of their attacks. This transformation lasts
until they’re bloodied again, and then it reverts. So in effect they have 360
HP, and will become bears for the middle third of that health bar.</p>

<p>In firbolg form, they fight unarmed with <strong>slams</strong>, and they can slam twice with
<strong>Double Attack</strong>. If they hit both attacks, they can also try to grab the
target. <strong>Bloodbear Maul</strong> allows them to automatically deal heavy physical
damage against the grabbed victim. They have Moonfire, but it’s only the basic
version.</p>

<p>In bloodbear form their slams turn into <strong>claw</strong> attacks that gain increased
damage, they gain a <strong>bite</strong> that does even more damage and deals ongoing damage
if the target is granting AC, and Bloodbear Maul also allows them to make a free
bite attack against the grabbed target.</p>

<h3 id="firbolg-ghostraven">Firbolg Ghostraven</h3>

<p>These are Raven Queen themed assassins. They fight with heavy war picks, which
are not the kind of weapon you’d expect an assassin to use. They can assume the
form of a ghostly raven, which allows them to better hide in shadows and ambush
their intended victims.</p>

<p>Ghostravens are Level 16 Elite Lurkers with 238 HP. Their <strong>picks</strong> are
High-Crit weapons, and they can attack twice with them. If both attacks hit the
victim is blinded (save ends). Assuming <strong>Ghostraven Form</strong> is a minor action
that makes them intangible, gives them a fly speed of 8, and gives them
concealment while in dim light or darkness. When a ghostraven attacks someone
who can’t see it, it deals increased damage.</p>

<h3 id="firbolg-master-of-the-wild-hunt">Firbolg Master of The Wild Hunt</h3>

<p>What it says on the tin. These hunt masters usually serve as leaders of firbolg
communities when they’re not heading a Wild Hunt.</p>

<p>Hunt Masters are Level 22 Elite Skirmishers with 404 HP. They wear the classic
stag helmet and fight with a <strong>Spear of the Hunt</strong> that can make both melee and
ranged attacks (it returns when thrown). Being elites, they can attack twice per
action.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Moonfire</strong> also marks and makes the target grant combat advantage until
the end of the master’s next turn. They deal increased damage to targets
affected by Moonfire (from <em>any</em> firbolg, not just their own).</p>

<p>Their special attack is a <strong>Mortal Strike</strong>, which allows them to make a basic
attack against a bloodied enemy that’s an automatic critical and deals 6d6
additional damage. If this reduces the target to 0 HP, it gives an extra action
point to the huntmaster. Action Points, as a reminder, can be spent to give
their owner a whole extra standard action on their turn. All elites start out
with one, and the hunt master is one of the few who can gain more during a
fight.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get two encounters:</p>

<p>The first is Level 13, a moon seer, a hunter and two hounders plus 2 centaur
hunters. This is either a “lesser” Wild Hunt or just a normal hunting
party/patrol. It hints that there’s likely a joint Centaur/Firbolg culture out
there somehwer.</p>

<p>The second is a proper scary Wild Hunt: the Master of the Wild Hunt along with
two Wild Hunt hounds, a bloodbear, and 2 ghostravens. It’s level 22, which means
relatively few things in the setting can really stand up to it.</p>

<p>I like firbolgs more than I though I would! There’s plenty of information on
them here, and it does plenty to differentiate them from the more standard
giants.</p>

<p>One thing I found a bit awkward are the bits of text in the book that say they
value “the middle path between good and evil”. This is derived from one of
Sehanine’s commandments, which is equally awkward. What does this mean? Are they
supposed to feed a puppy one day and kick it on the next to keep things
balanced? A more charitable interpretation might be that they’re not any more
inclined to trust people who claim to be champions of good than they are anyone
else, and try to stay out of those particular cosmic struggles.</p>

<p>I think it’s fair to say that eladrins can be overachievers. Their societies
produce a lot of gallant knights and powerful spellcasters, who go on to
accumulate glory and renown to their name. They’ll be the first to say the world
is a better place due to their efforts.</p>

<p>Sometimes, though, things go wrong. A knight perishes with a quest unfulfilled,
or a mage dies just before making that one crucial breakthrough that would get
him tenure at Lórien Polytechnic. Whether from violence, accident or natural
causes, such deaths are incredibly frustrating for the eladrin in question, so
they simply refuse to go. The entity that results from this is known as a Fey
Lingerer.</p>

<p>Fey lingerers resemble the people they were in life, but the book describes then
as “withdrawn from elven grace”. In other words, they look clearly dead, their
formerly shiny countenances now decomposed or dessicated. They’re also quite
cruel and anti-social, their personalities now dominated by the frustration and
anger that kept them from passing on.</p>

<p>Lingerers generally try to accomplish whatever it is they were trying to do when
they died, and can linger on even after that, looking for ways to gain the glory
and fame they feel were due to them while they lived. They might employ other
undead in this, and sometimes they also gather living eladrin followers who are
willing to help their fallen heroes.</p>

<p>When a fey lingerer is destroyed in combat, its spirit emerges angrier than
ever. This <em>vestige</em> knows it can never complete its objectives now that its
body has been destroyed, and becomes obsessed with taking revenge on those
responsible.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Fey lingerers are corporeal undead, and since they used to be overachieving
eladrin luminaries, they’re usually mid-to-late Paragon-tier. As is standard for
undead, they have Darkvision plus some level of Necrotic resistance and Radiant
Vulnerability.</p>

<p>Lingerers retain the eladrin Fey Step power, and add an aura of <strong>Spiraling
Despair</strong> (radius 3) which inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks and saves to enemies
caught inside. They also have an extra bonus on saves against charm effects.</p>

<p>They’re Elite monsters, but this is implemented in a novel and very interesting
way. Normally an Elite would have double HP, but Fey Lingerers have the normal
amount. However, when they hit 0 HP they become Vestiges, incorporeal undead
with their own stat blocks. They start in the same position as the original
lingerer, and act on the same initiative order, but are otherwise treated as if
they had just entered the fight: full HP, all abilities unused.</p>

<p>Vestiges aren’t worth any additional XP when fought as part of a lingerer fight
since the lingerer’s XP total accounts for them. You can design encounters
with vestiges directly, though, and in that case they’re worth XP as normal for
a regular monster of their level.</p>

<h3 id="lingerer-knight">Lingerer Knight</h3>

<p>These knights usually died when trying to fulfill an important mission or quest,
and are driven to complete it. They might have been honorable sorts before their
deaths, but now they’re just desperate. Bearing the same weapons they did in
life, they can infuse their strikes with necrotic energy and force enemies to
experience their rather unhealthy mental state.</p>

<p>Lingerer Knights are Level 16 Elite Soldiers with 152 HP. They have all standard
lingerer traits and a speed of 6. Their necrotic resistance is 10, and their
radiant vulnerability 5. The one in the book fights with a <strong>Longsword</strong> that
also inflicts ongoing necrotic damage (save ends). <strong>Double Attack</strong> allows it
to perform two sword attacks in a single action.</p>

<p>They can also perform a spell called <strong>Spirit Sword Circle</strong> (recharge 5+), a
Close Burst 1 vs. Reflex that does slightly less damage than a double attack and
also inflicts ongoing necrotic damage (save ends).</p>

<p>That unhealthy mental state manifests as two different powers: <strong>Desperate
Challenge</strong> (Ranged 10; Encounter) allows the knight to mark a target until the
end of the fight or until the knight discorporates, whichever comes
first. Marked targets take some automatic necrotic damage when they make an
attack that doesn’t target the knight. <strong>Spiritual Despondence</strong> triggers when
the knight is first bloodied and deals automatic necrotic damage in a Close
Burst 3.</p>

<h3 id="fey-knight-vestige">Fey-Knight Vestige</h3>

<p>A destroyed lingerer knight becomes one of these. It’s a Level 16 Lurker with 75
HP. It has all standard lingerer traits, a ground speed of 6, and a fly speed
of 6. Its resistances and vulnerabilities increase by 5 each, and it’s also
insubstantial.</p>

<p>The vestige fights with a <strong>Ghostsword</strong> that targets Fortitude instead of AC,
does necrotic damage, and makes the target grant combat advantage to the vestige
(save ends). This means it can do its “Lurker thing” while staying in the front
lines, which is a bit unusual but matches the “knight” flavor. <strong>Desperate
Dash</strong> (move; recharge 5+) allows it to shift 6 squares and possibly escape
being surrounded.</p>

<h3 id="lingerer-fell-incanter">Lingerer Fell Incanter</h3>

<p>Fell Incanters hang around for more open-ended reasons than knights, and are
usually obsessed with obtaining more arcane knowledge and power in order to Show
Them All. Their magic is tinted with their hatred, so all of it does necrotic
damage. So they’re kind of Lich-Lite.</p>

<p>Fell Incanters are Level 18 Elite Artillery with 130 HP and all standard
lingerer traits. They’re armed with a <strong>quarterstaff</strong> that also inflicts
ongoing necrotic damage (save ends).</p>

<p>At range they can fire <strong>Soul Bolts</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) that deal
necrotic damage and immobilize (save ends). <strong>Double Attack</strong> allows them to
shoot two of these in one action. After they’re bloodied, they can also use a
<strong>Soul Blast</strong> (close blast 3 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5+) that does necrotic
damage and weakens until the end of the incanter’s next turn.</p>

<h3 id="fey-incanter-vestige">Fey-Incanter Vestige</h3>

<p>When a fell incanter is destroyed, it becomes one of these. It’s a Level 18
Lurker with 91 HP. Its resistances and vulnerabilities are increased by 5 each,
it gains a fly speed, and becomes insubstantial.</p>

<p>Incanter vestiges have no melee attacks. Their basic attack is a <strong>Ray of
Humility</strong> (Ranged 5 vs. Will) doing both immediate and ongoing necrotic
damage. It also inflicts 5e disadvantage (roll 2d20 and take the lowest die) on
the victim’s saves, with a successful save ending both this and the ongoing
damage.</p>

<p>There’s also <strong>Ray of Spring’s Rejection</strong> (ranged 5 vs. Will; recharge 5+),
which does more damage and makes the target grant combat advantage to the
vestige (save ends). And, like the knight vestige, this one deals increased
damage to people granting CA to it.</p>

<p>This results in an enemy that’s a bit similar to the knight vestige but with a
ranged focus. It’s also a lot harder to save against its CA-granting effect.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 18: two lingerer knights, 1 fell incanter, and a
living bralani of autumn winds who is probably one of the incanter’s fan-elves.</p>

<p>I think fey lingerers are really interesting! Though I described them as “Lich
Lite”, I actually think they’re a bit more flavorful than standard liches, what
with the whole “become a vengeful ghost” mechanic. I always felt D&amp;D 4 could
have done a lot more with such multi-stage enemies.</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> fell taints are new to 4e - at least, this book is where I first heard
of them. If they showed up in previous editions, it was probably in 3e.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>I confess the name made me think of something you might find staining an ogre’s
underwear, but that’s not the case. Fell Taints are small predators from the Far
Realm, where they occupy a niche more or less equivalent to that of our
foxes. However, they’re quite a bit more dangerous when they cross into the
world, which they can do rather easily in places where the border between it and
the Far Realm is even a little bit thinner than usual.</p>

<p>Their presence acts as a beacon for more powerful and dangerous Far Realm
denizens, and slowly erodes the barrier between dimensions. So if you have fell
taints in a place, you’ll soon get bigger horrors from beyond popping up.</p>

<p>The taints themselves are also dangerous on their own, since they hunt by
destroying the mind of their intended prey with their psychic powers. This is
not exactly something most mortal creatures have a strong defense against.</p>

<p>One of the bizarre things about Fell Taints is that they’re only half real. The
other half is formed by the minds of those who see them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Fell Taints are Baby’s First Elder Things, with levels in the early-to-mid
Heroic tier. If you’re starting an aberrant-themed campaign from Level 1,
they’re going to be the first genuine Far Realm denizens your party meets.</p>

<p>Fell Taints can fly quite well with a speed of 6 and hover capability, or crawl
along the ground at speed 1 if they must. They’re insubstantial due to that
half-real thing, but vulnerable to psychic damage. The touch of their
<strong>tendrils</strong> causes psychic damage, and they usually have mind-affecting special
attacks as well. They’re all Aberrant Magical Beasts, and most are Small.</p>

<p>An ability they all share is <strong>Fell Taint Feeding</strong>: when they manage to get a
victim helpless or unconscious, they can begin to feed. This causes them to lose
their fly speed and become substantial until the end of their next turn, but
allows them to perform a <em>coup de grace</em> against the victim. If this kills the
victim, the fell taint immediately recovers all of its hit points. Yeah, they’ll
absolutely attempt to kill any PC that drops to 0 HP during the fight.</p>

<h3 id="fell-taint-lasher">Fell Taint Lasher</h3>

<p>Lashers are Level 1 Soldiers with 20 HP and all standard traits outlined
above. Their special attack is <strong>Tendrils of Stasis</strong>, which does a bit less
damage than the basic tendril slap and immobilizes the target for a turn. When
making an opportunity attack, they can shift as a free action.</p>

<h3 id="fell-taint-pulsar">Fell Taint Pulsar</h3>

<p>Pulsars are Level 1 Artillery with 18 HP and all common traits. Their special
attacks are a Range 20 <strong>tendril pulse</strong> that does psychic damage, and a Ranged
10 <strong>tendril flurry</strong> that makes a slightly weaker attack against up to three
targets.</p>

<h3 id="fell-taint-tought-eater">Fell Taint Tought Eater</h3>

<p>These are Level 2 Controllers with 26 HP and all standard traits. They have two
special attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Spirit Haze</strong> is a Range 10 attack that does psychic damage and dazes for a
turn. <strong>Tought Fog</strong> (recharge 5+) is a Close Burst 5 that only targets enemies,
does no damage, and slows. This worsens to immobilization after the first failed
save.</p>

<h3 id="fell-taint-warp-wender">Fell Taint Warp Wender</h3>

<p>This Level 4 Controller is Medium, and has 38 HP. Its single special attack is
<strong>Psychic Transposition</strong>, which does light psychic damage, dazes (save ends)
and makes the taint and the victim teleport to exchange places.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounters are mostly mixed fell taint groups, because they rarely
work with anyone else. Still, they might be coincidentally found alongside
undead or oozes, creatures they find unapettizing. I imagine some cultists and
such might also know how to bind them.</p>

<p>As a party’s first contact with the Far Realm, I think these creatures are quite
nifty. They look weird enough to unsettle, and each has a single distinctive
mechanical trick.</p>

<p>Technically, any creature with the “elemental” origin is an elemental, but as we
saw in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/16/elemental.html">Elemental</a> entry from the first monster manual the name is also
used for a particularly wild subset of that plane’s denizens.</p>

<p>As you can see in that earlier post, Elementals proper are some of the “basest”
life forms of the Elemental Chaos, with bodies that share a lot more with their
constituent elements than with any sort of living organism. Unlike demons
they’re not actively malicious, but they’re mercurial and easy to provoke into a
rampage.</p>

<p>As magical beasts, they’re technically sapient, but their intellects tend to be
rather limited. These creatures are also often bound by elementally-inclined
ritual casters such as mortal wizards, efreets, and others.</p>

<p>The MM2 presents us with more elementals ranging from the mid-Heroic to the
early Epic tier.</p>

<h2 id="chillfire-destroyer">Chillfire Destroyer</h2>

</figure>

<p>A Large humanoid made of ice wrapped around a fiery core, which means it has
zero chill. It’s a Level 14 Brute with 173 HP, lumbering about at Speed 5. It
has 10 resistance to cold and fire, and is immune to disease and poison. Its
<strong>fists</strong> do a mix of fire and cold damage, and it can also move its speed and
<strong>trample</strong> anyone it comes into contact with during this movement.</p>

<p>As this elemental gets damaged, its shell begins to crack. Once it’s bloodied,
its <strong>Leaking Firecore</strong> acts as an aura (radius 2) that deals fire damage to
anyone caught inside. Once it reaches 0 HP, a <strong>Firecore Breach</strong> causes it to
explode! This explosion is a Close Burst 3 vs. Reflex, dealing heavy fire
damage.</p>

<h2 id="dust-devil">Dust Devil</h2>

</figure>

<p>A being or air and earth, this capricious living whirlwind has a tendency to
sandblast anyone who makes it angry. It’s Small, and a Level 3 Skirmisher with
47 HP and a ground speed of 8. No, they can’t fly. It’s immune to disease and
poison, and it suffers a -2 penalty to all of its defenses if slowed or
immobilized.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is <strong>Grasping Winds</strong>, which targets Reflex, does some physical
damage and slides the target 3 squares. <strong>Gale Blast</strong> allows it to shift 5
squares by moving really fast, and try to knock anyone in the way prone (attack
vs. Fortitude).</p>

<p>Once per encounter it can do that sandblasting trick with <strong>Stinging Sands</strong>
(close burst 3 vs. Fortitude), which does heavy damage and blinds for a turn.</p>

<h2 id="flamespiker">Flamespiker</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-flamespiker.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These are a triple combination of air, earth, and fire, taking the form of a
Medium stony humanoid who can use high-pressure air to fire red-hot spikes from
its fiery core. They’re more like people than wildlife, and often end up hired
as front-line muscle by other sapient elementals.</p>

<p>Flamespikers are level 5 soldiers with 66 HP and a ground speed of 7. Their
immunities include disease, poison, and petrification, and they also have 10
fire resistance.</p>

<p>The flamespiker fights with its Reach 2 <strong>Stonespikes</strong> in melee, and can also
fire them at out to range 10 as <strong>Spikebolts</strong>. Both attacks do physical damage,
and the melee one also makes the target vulnerable to fire damage until the end
of the spiker’s next turn. So it pairs really well with fire elementals.</p>

<p>If an enemy within reach shifts, the stonespiker can react with a <strong>Thunderfire
Thrust</strong> (recharge 5+), which is a basic melee attack with an extra follow-up
against Fortitude that does 5 thunder damage and stuns (save ends). This makes
slipping past them a difficult proposition.</p>

<h2 id="geonid">Geonid</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-geonid.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This Large creature has more of a metabolism than most elementals, and needs to
hunt. A stony oyster-like creature, the geonid is extremely hard to tell apart
from a boulder when its shell is closed. When it reveals itself, we can see that
it’s yet another tentacular ambush predator that lives in the shallow Underdark.</p>

<p>They were initially created to guard the secret pathways of the world, and the
secret caches of weapons, dormant war-beasts, and treasure hidden there by the
forces of the primordials. Some of those caches are still out there, as are
their guardians.</p>

<p>Geonids are Level 6 Lurkers with 56 HP. They’re immune to disease, petrification
and poison, and cal roll around at speed 4. With its shell closed, potential
victims must pass a DC 28 Perception check to realize it’s not a harmless
boulder. At level 6, this is hard even for the party’s “radar”.</p>

<p>Once the geonid strikes, it fights with <strong>tentacle</strong> slaps that do standard
physical damage. It can also use a <strong>capturing grab</strong> that consists of two
weaker tentacle attacks. If both hit, it grabs the target (escape DC 17).</p>

<p>Once it’s grabbed someone, the geonid will close itself with <strong>Shell Slam</strong>,
which does a lot of things at once. It slides a grabbed victim to the geonid’s
space, and it tries to knock everyone in a close burst 2 prone (vs. Fortitude).</p>

<p>While the shell is closed, the geonid has a ground speed of 0 and a +5 to all of
its defenses, and it can’t target anyone other than the grabbed victim it pulled
inside its shell. The victim can also only target the geonid, but on the bright
side it won’t have to contend with the defense bonus. If the victim escapes, it
gets spit out and appears adjacent to the geonid, who can open its shell with a
minor action.</p>

<h2 id="mudlasher">Mudlasher</h2>

<figure class="left">

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another sapient elemental predator, mudlashers are made of well, mud. They slam
and drown their victims, and then sit atop the corpse as a puddle to slowly
digest it. They’re Medium Level 4 Brutes with 63 HP.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>Slams</strong> do physical damage, and once per fight they can upgrade
that to a <strong>Drowning Slam</strong> that targets Fortitude and adds an ongoing damage
follow-up (save ends).</p>

<p>They can also fling <strong>mud balls</strong> at range (vs. Reflex), which do no damage but
slow their targets. If a target is already slowed, it’s immobilized
instead. This is good because the mudlasher gets a +2 to attacks against slowed
or immobilized targets. A save will end either condition.</p>

<h2 id="rockfist-smasher">Rockfist Smasher</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-rockfist-smasher.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The name says it all: they’re humanoid rocks that like to smash with their
fists. Smashers don’t need to eat, so they do that for fun. People who build
elemental themed dungeons like to gather a bunch of these and lock them in
chambers and at the bottom of pits as living traps.</p>

<p>These hooligans are Large, Level 10 Brutes with 125 HP, the standard suite of
earth-creature immunities, and a speed of 5. Their <strong>Granite Punches</strong> do good
damage and knock bloodied targets prone.</p>

<p>When a smasher gets bloodied itself, its <strong>Internal Avalanche</strong> triggers and
begins accumulating kinetic energy. This gives the smasher 20 temporary HP. If
it still has any temp HP at the start of its next turn, it gains an action point
that must be used in that turn.</p>

<h2 id="shardstorm-vortex">Shardstorm Vortex</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-rockfist-smasher.png"/>

</figure>

<p>These are living blizzards made of stone instead of ice. Despite this impressive
description, they’re just Medium in size and are the scavengers of the Elemental
Chaos. Shardstorms follow in the wake of more impressive beings and feed on what
remains of their battles. In battle they work like slightly stronger dust
devils.</p>

<p>They’re level 7 skirmishers with 80 HP. Their ground speed is 0, but they fly at
speed 8 with hover capability and project a <strong>Sandblast</strong> aura (radius 1) that
inflicts a -2 to all defenses of anyone caught inside.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Abrasive Slam</strong> that targets Fortitude and does
physical damage. They can also perform <strong>Whirling Blasts</strong> (recharge 5+) that
allow them to shift 4 squares and an attack at the end. This does heavy damage
and pushes 1 square on a hit. It does half damage on a miss.</p>

<p>We also get two variant stat blocks for them as minions at levels 13
and 23. They still have the aura and the basic attack, but instead of the Blast
they get a <strong>Vortex Step</strong>, an at-will 4-square shift with no built-in attack.</p>

<h2 id="stormstone-fury">Stormstone Fury</h2>

<figure class="right">

  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a Medium stone humanoid infused with the power of a storm. It can throw
explosive stones, cause shrapnel to fly outward from its body, and meld into the
ground for a quick escape. When fighting as part of a team they don’t really
care about catching allies in their blasts, so if you find yourself on the same
side as one of these, bring some thunder protection.</p>

<p>Furies are Level 14 Artillery with 113 HP and Speed 6. They have the usual
immunity suite, and 10 thunder resistance. Its <strong>Grinding Stones</strong> melee basic
attack is terrible, but its <strong>Hurtling Thunderstones</strong> have Range 20 and do half
damage on a miss. Hit or miss, they also cause a follow-up explosion (burst 2
vs. Fortitude) that does thunder damage.</p>

<p><strong>Shrapnel Burst</strong> is their “keep away from me” power, sending shrapnel that
pushes 2 squares and does physical and thunder damage in a close burst 2
(vs. AC). If that fails, <strong>Meld to Ground</strong> removes them from the map for a
turn, after which they reappear up to 10 squares away.</p>

<h2 id="tempest-wisp">Tempest Wisp</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-tempest-wisp.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This gaseous creature is a bit smarter than your average elemental, and actively
seeks to either ally with or coerce other creatures to form groups that
cooperate against threats. It uses its wind powers to push enemies around the
battlefield, and hides behind its allies to avoid damage.</p>

<p>Tempest Wisps are Level 13 Controllers with 134 HP. They’re immune to disease
and poison, and are insubstantial while not bloodied (i.e, while at over 50%
HP). They have a flight speed of 7 with hover capability.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is an <strong>Air Slash</strong> (vs. Reflex) that does physical damage,
and they can attack at range with <strong>Whistling Wind</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Reflex) for
about the same damage and a 1-square slide.</p>

<p>Their limited special attack is hilarious! Named <strong>Tumbling Updraft</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Fortitude; recharge 5+), it does no immediate damage but instead lifts the
target 20 feet up on a hit and restrains them (save ends). Each failed save
causes the victim to be tossed up another 20 feet. On a successful save, the
victim falls! That’s a minimum of 2d10 fall damage, plus another 2d10 for every
failed save. It’s all subject to the standard rules for falls, though, so you
might be able to reduce or avoid this damage in the usual ways.</p>

<h2 id="windfiend-fury">Windfiend Fury</h2>

<p>Yet another Angry Tornado, this one more purely “stormy” than the others. These
Large beings like to hang around elemental storms, and so tend to get swept away
into other planes. Sometimes archons will capture them and bind them to their
flying ships as a power source and as a means to travel to other planes. You can
also say these are the beings trapped at the core of those Eberron flying ships.</p>

<p>These are Level 12 Controllers with 123 HP and a flight speed of 8. Aside from
the usual immunities to disease and poison they have 15 resistance to lightning
and thunder.</p>

<p>They attack in melee with <strong>Flying Debris</strong>, and toss <strong>Lightning Strikes</strong> at
range that do lightning damage and daze for a turn. Their “keep away!” power is
a <strong>Storm Burst</strong> that does thunder damage and teleports them to just outside
the area of effect.</p>

<h2 id="windstriker">Windstriker</h2>

<p>Our final Angry Tornado is Medium, and a Level 9 Lurker with 56 HP. They have
the usual immunities and full-time insubstantiality, along with a flight speed
of 8. It attacks unpredictably, though apparently not to feed.</p>

<p>All of their attacks do “cold and thunder” damage. They’re probably going to
open up with <strong>Searching Wind</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will), which knocks prone on a
hit and marks the target as the windstriker’s quarry as an effect. Then they’ll
follow that up with <strong>Lethal Windstrike</strong> (melee 2 vs. AC), which hits hard but
only works against the quarry. Their basic <strong>Windstrike</strong> is a lot weaker, so
it’s for emergencies only.</p>

<p>If the windstriker takes damage, it activates <strong>Shifting Wind</strong> as a reaction,
which gives it the ability to ignore opportunity attacks and pass through enemy
spaces during its next turn. So it’s going to be flitting back and forth to
alternate marking someone as a quarry and attempting to assassinate them.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s a whole bunch of sample encounters here, but they’re all easily to
described: assorted elementals of similar level, occasionally with someone who
might be the spellcaster binding them, like a tiefling heretic or a beholder.</p>

<p>I like the lore of elementals in 4e on principle, and we have lots of
mechanically varied stat blocks here… but there’s <em>so many</em> of them that they
all kinda started blurring together by the end. I almost wish we had gotten an
elemental “plug-in” module for the 4e monster design system rather than this
long list full of angry rock giants and angry living tornadoes.</p>
