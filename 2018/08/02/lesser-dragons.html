<p>This is another entry in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">Dragon’s Dogma bestiary</a>. So, uh, it’s been a
while since I posted one of these hasn’t it? The reason for that is
twofold. First, we’re getting into the final stretch of the game’s main plot
here, and I confess I haven’t played it much past that point.</p>

<p>Second is that the only monsters really left to cover are dragons, and dragons
are kinda hard to stat not only because I feel I have to get them right, but
because the Dungeon Fantasy RPG already did such a good job of it that almost
anything I tried to do would only end up looking like a straight copy from
it. Here is my attempt to do something different.</p>

<h2 id="lesser-dragons">Lesser Dragons</h2>

<p>The path of the Arisen is a long and grueling one, and one of the most shocking
revelations many of them face while walking it is that <em>The</em> Dragon is not the
only such beast. There are others, smaller in size but still quite large and
deadly.</p>

<p>Most people of Gransys ignore the existence of lesser dragons. Not even those
who make it their business to study the cycle know much about them. The secret
of their origin might only be learned from the dragons themselves, or from an
ancient Arisen who survived past encounters with them: every lesser dragon was
once an Arisen. One who was defeated by <em>The</em> Dragon, and as a result was
reincarnated in a draconic body to be sent into the world during further
incursions.</p>

<p>Lesser dragons have the same general body plan as their larger “cousin”. They
fight with their natural weapons (teeth, claws, tail, elemental breath) but
might also have access to some of the powers they posessed in their past
lives. A lesser dragon’s recollection of that life varies from individual to
individual, but all feel a compulsion to test the might of the Arisen in deadly
combat. How they deal with that also varies from individual to individual.</p>

<p>All such creatures are sapient and capable of speech, though only the Arisen and
the Pawns can understand their language.</p>

<p>If you have access to <strong>DFRPG: Monsters</strong>, the stats for SM+3 dragons contained
there are perfectly adequate for representing Dragon’s Dogma lesser
dragons. The stats for western dragons found in <strong>GURPS Dragons</strong> also work
nicely.</p>

<p>If you can’t or don’t want to use those, keep reading!</p>

<h2 id="build-a-dragon">Build-A-Dragon</h2>

<p>Rather than giving you a “canonical” lesser dragon stat block, I’m going to give
you a basic, generic template and instructions on how to customize it. This
reinforces the notion that every lesser dragon is a unique individual.</p>

<h3 id="basic-lesser-dragon-stats">Basic Lesser Dragon Stats</h3>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 20; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 13;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 20; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 13;</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong> 6.25; <strong>Move</strong> 6 (Air Move 13); <strong>SM</strong> +3</p>

<p><strong>DR</strong> 3</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bite</strong> : thrust-1 cutting, +1 per die. Reach C, 1. Can count as a grapple!</li>
  <li><strong>Front Claw</strong>: thrust-1 cutting, +1 per die. Reach C-2.</li>
  <li><strong>Hind Claw</strong>: thrust cutting, +1 per die. Reach C-2.</li>
  <li><strong>Horns</strong>: thrust-1 cutting, +1 per die. Treat as weapon for attacking and
parrying. Reach C, 1.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail</strong>: Thrust crushing, +1 per die, or double that for knockback
only. Reach C-3.</li>
  <li><strong>Wing</strong>: thrust -1 crushing, +1 per die, or double that for knockback
only. Reach C-3.</li>
  <li><strong>Breath Weapon</strong>: Costs 2 FP per use, with no recharge time or limit of uses
per day. Can be any one of the types listed in <strong>DFRPG: Monsters</strong> <em>or</em>
lightning (1mx10m cone, burn damage, metal armor only protects with DR 1;
dragon has double DR vs lightning). Damage for the cone-shaped breaths weapons
is based on thrust for the dragon’s ST.</li>
  <li><strong>Dominate Pawn</strong>: As the Charm spell, cast at skill 15. Costs 3 FP and works
only on Pawns.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Bad Grip 2, Extra Attack 1; Flight (Winged); High Pain Threshold;
Horizontal; Immunity to Disease; Loner (12); Nictitating Membrane 3; Night
Vision 9; Penetrating Voice; Peripheral Vision; Temperature Tolerance 2 (Cold);
Temperature Tolerance 4 (Heat); Unfazeable.</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<h3 id="customizing-your-dragon">Customizing your dragon</h3>

<p>To get a final stat block for your dragon, you’re going to have to decide who
they were in life. Choose the DFRPG professional template that most closely
matches the original person’s capabilities, and quickly select what advantages
and disadvantages that person had. Let’s call that the original
character. Combine it with the dragon stats above in the following way:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ST</strong>: For every point ST the original character has over 10, add 2 to the
dragon’s ST.</li>
  <li><strong>DX</strong>, <strong>IQ</strong>, <strong>HT</strong>: For every point over 10 the character template has in
these attributes, add 1 to the dragon’s corresponding attribute.</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary Characteristics</strong>: Figure the new totals from the dragon’s final
primary attributes, plus any modifying traits from the original
character. <em>Double</em> any levels of Lifting ST, Striking ST or extra HP - all
other such traits apply at the same level.</li>
  <li><strong>Other Advantages and Disadvanatages</strong>: These all transfer directly to the
dragon where applicable, and are modified to apply to the dragon’s natural DR
or weapons where it makes sense. Points spent in things like Armor or Shield
Mastery would convert into increased DR or defenses for the dragon, and a
former Weapon Master might be considered Trained by a Master when fighting
with its natural weapons.</li>
  <li><strong>Skills</strong>: The dragon has a Brawling skill equal to the original character’s
highest melee combat skill, or DX+2, whichever is highest. It also has an
Innate Attack skill equal to the original character’s highest ranged combat
skill or DX+2, whichever is highest. Points spent on Acrobatics or other such
movement skills would transfer to Flight and Aerobatics instead. All other
skills transfer directly.</li>
  <li><strong>Magic</strong>: Magery, spells and any other magic powers transfer directly!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want tougher dragons, the easiest way to get them is to start with a more
powerful original character. You can also increase the dragon’s base DR to a
level you find appropriate before performing the rest of the operations above.</p>

<h2 id="example-dragons">Example Dragons</h2>

<p>These are the three lesser dragons you can find in the original game.</p>

<h3 id="the-drake">The Drake</h3>

<p>This dragon was once a dutiful knight that protected his liege with sword and
shield. Now he feels compelled to test the current Arisen’s resolve to face the
challenges he himself could not.</p>

<p>The Drake prefers to stay on the ground and engage his opponents in melee
combat, making use of Rapid Strikes and Deceptive Attacks. Enemies who try to
keep their distance get hit with his fiery breath weapon, or dominated if
they’re Pawns. All the while, he taunts them and questions their worth.</p>

<p>The Drake will not pursue foes who choose to flee and escape its chosen
territory, unless the Arisen is among them. In that case, or if its opponents
stand their ground, he will fight to the death.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 32; <strong>DX</strong> 16; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 16.</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 32; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 16.</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong> 8.50; <strong>Move</strong> 8 (Air Move 16); <strong>SM</strong> +3</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 12; <strong>Parry</strong> 14; <strong>DR</strong>: 6 (12 vs fire)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bite (20)</strong>: 3d+3 cut; Reach C,1. Can count as a grapple!</li>
  <li><strong>Front Claw (20)</strong>: 3d+3 cut, Reach C-2.</li>
  <li><strong>Hind Claw (20)</strong>: 3d+4 cut, Reach C-2.</li>
  <li><strong>Horns (20)</strong>: 3d+3 cut, Reach C,1. Counts as a weapon for attacking and
parrying.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail (18)</strong>: 3d+4 cr, or double that for knockback only. Reach C-3.</li>
  <li><strong>Wing (20)</strong>: 3d+3 cr, or double that for knockback only. Reach C-3.</li>
  <li><strong>Dominate Pawn (15)</strong>: As the Charm spell. Costs 3 FP and works only on
Pawns.</li>
  <li><strong>Fire Breath (16)</strong>: Costs 2 FP per use. 1m-wide and 10m-long cone of flame;
3d+1 burn.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Bad Grip 2; Born War-Leader 2; Combat Reflexes; Extra Attack 1;
Flight (Winged); High Pain Threshold; Horizontal; Immunity to Disease; Loner
(12); Nictitating Membrane 3; Night Vision 9; Penetrating Voice; Peripheral
Vision; Temperature Tolerance 2 (Cold); Temperature Tolerance 4 (Heat); Trained
by a Master; Vow (never refuse a challenge to combat); Unfazeable.</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Brawling-20; Carousing-16; Forced Entry-16; Innate Attack
(breath)-16; Leadership-12; Strategy-11; Tactics-11;</p>

<h3 id="the-wyrm">The Wyrm</h3>

<p>The Wyrm was once a wizard whose spells failed him when he needed them the
most. As a lesser dragon he remains quite articulate and fully cognizant of his
past life and current situation. He seeks to lair in the ancient ruins of his
city and stay out of the conflict, but will still fight the Arisen should the
two meet.</p>

<p>In an hostile encounter, the Wyrm will try to lead the PCs to an arena of his
choosing before engaging. He will prefer to fight in an enclosed, flooded ruin
chamber where his sound and ice spells are extra effective. In combat the Wyrm
relies on his spells. He might try to incapacitate his opponents with Daze of
Sleep (in single or mass versions), surprise non-Pawns by dominating them with
Charm, or cast Resist Sound on himself and attack with Concussion and
Thunderclap. His physical abilities remain formidable of course, and so does his
breath weapon.</p>

<p>That said, out of all the example lesser dragons here the Wyrm is the most
likely to be friendly if the party doesn’t include any Arisen, and could be
convinced to impart some important piece of lore or teach some of his magic by
sufficiently honey-tongued characters.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 20; <strong>DX</strong>: 14; <strong>IQ</strong> 15; <strong>HT</strong> 14;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 20; <strong>Will</strong> 16; <strong>Per</strong> 13; <strong>FP</strong> 16.</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong> 8.00; <strong>Move</strong> 8 (Air Move 16); <strong>SM</strong> +3</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 11; <strong>Parry</strong> 13; <strong>DR</strong>: 3 (6 vs cold)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bite</strong> : 2d+1 cutting. Reach C, 1. Can count as a grapple!</li>
  <li><strong>Front Claw</strong>: 2d+1 cutting. Reach C-2.</li>
  <li><strong>Hind Claw</strong>: 2d+2 cutting. Reach C-2.</li>
  <li><strong>Horns</strong>: 2d+1 cutting. Treat as weapon for attacking and parrying. Reach C,
1.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail</strong>: 2d+2 cr, or double that for knockback only. Reach C-3.</li>
  <li><strong>Wing</strong>: 2d+1 cr, or double that for knockback only. Reach C-3.</li>
  <li><strong>Breath Weapon</strong>: Costs 2 FP per use. 1m-wide, 10m-long cone of cold, 2d-1
burn damage. Won’t set fires.</li>
  <li><strong>Dominate Pawn</strong>: As the Charm spell, cast at skill 15. Costs 3 FP and works
only on Pawns.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Bad Grip 2, Energy Reserve 8; Extra Attack 1; Flight (Winged); High
Pain Threshold; Horizontal; Immunity to Disease; Improved Magic Resistance 1;
Loner (12); Magery 4; Nictitating Membrane 3; Night Vision 9; Penetrating Voice;

<h3 id="the-wyvern">The Wyvern</h3>

<p>The Wyvern was a scout, quick and nimble, who zigged when she should have
zagged. Only recently reincarnated, she is still confused and running on little
more than instinct.</p>

<p>The Wyvern will fight any who approach her by taking to the air and doing
strafing runs with her lightning breath or front claws, which don’t incur any of
the usual penalties for Move and Attack. These can include attempts to grab a
target and drop it from a great height. She will only fight for long enough to
discourage pursuit before flying away to look for a safe place to rest, unless
the party contains an Arisen - then, as usual for lesser dragons, she will be
compelled to fight to the death.</p>

<p>The Wyvern departs from the generic template a bit more by trading the ability
to dominate pawns for a beefier than usual breath weapon and the enhanced
skirmishing ability described above.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 22; <strong>DX</strong> 16; <strong>IQ</strong> 11; <strong>HT</strong> 15;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 22; <strong>Will</strong> 13; <strong>Per</strong> 16; <strong>FP</strong> 15;</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong> 9.25; <strong>Move</strong> 9 (Air Move 18); <strong>SM</strong> +3</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 13; <strong>Parry</strong> 13; <strong>DR</strong> 5 (10 vs. electricity)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bite (18)</strong> : 2d+2 cut. Reach C, 1. Can count as a grapple!</li>
  <li><strong>Front Claw (18)</strong>: 2d+2 cut. Reach C-2.</li>
  <li><strong>Hind Claw (18)</strong>: 2d+3 cut. Reach C-2.</li>
  <li><strong>Horns (18)</strong>: 2d+2 cut. Treat as weapon for attacking and
parrying. Reach C, 1.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail (16)</strong>: 2d+3 cr, or double that for knockback only. Reach C-3.</li>
  <li><strong>Wing (18)</strong>: 2d+2 cr, or double that for knockback only. Reach C-3.</li>
  <li><strong>Breath Weapon (20)</strong>: Costs 1 FP per use, with no recharge time or limit of
uses per day. 1m-wide, 20m-long cone doing 2d+2 burn damage. Metal armor
protects with only DR 1.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Absolute Direction; Bad Grip 2, Combat Reflexes; Danger Sense; Extra
Attack 1; Flight (Winged); High Pain Threshold; Horizontal; Immunity to Disease;
