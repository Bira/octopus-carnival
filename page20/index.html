            <p>Oozes have been in the game since the beginning, and as you can see in <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/09/02/ooze.html">this
post</a> the first 4e Monster Manual already featured a bunch of them. As I say
there, far more adventurers lost their lives to an ooze than to one of the
game’s titular dragons.</p>

<p>Here in the MM2 we get a few more oozes, some of which would go on to feature in
the Monster Vault. All of the oozes here have the Blind and Ooze keywords, which
make them immune to gaze attacks and particularly adept at squeezing through
small spaces. They also have BLindsight 10 and Tremorsense 10.</p>

<h2 id="abolethic-skum">Abolethic Skum</h2>

<figure class="left">

<p>As we saw way back in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/01/04/aboleth.html">Aboleth</a> post, Aboleths can turn mortals into
servitors, a process which turns their skin into a layer of transparent
slime. Sometimes, though, this process goes awry and the victim’s form loses all
physical integrity. The resulting watery blobs full of organs are known as
“skum”.</p>

<p>Abolethic skums are barely sentient, but some memory of what they were remains
with them. This tangles up with residual fear and shame at what they have
become, so they tend to attack anyone who resembles their old form.</p>

<p>Skum are Level 18 Minion Brutes with the Aquatic keyword in addition to the
default ones. They emit a Psychic Dissonance aura (1) that inflicts Vulnerable 5
Psychic to every creature inside. They have Resist 20 Acid and crawl around at
Speed 2, but can swim at Speed 8.</p>

<p>Their <strong>slams</strong> target Fortitude and do a flat 16 acid damage, which is in line
with Monster Vault math. And their <strong>Aqueous Form</strong> trait makes them invisible
while in water.</p>

<p>Despite being described as failed experiments, a skum’s stats make it complement
its aboleth masters very well. If your PCs go into underwater Underdark
adventure (double the under for half the price!) make sure to place a psychic
aboleth in a room packed full of invisible skum. See how long it takes for your
PCs to figure out why they’re taking extra damage from the aboleth <em>and</em>
dissolving.</p>

<h2 id="black-pudding">Black Pudding</h2>

<p>These also appear in the Monster Vault, so we covered them in <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/09/02/ooze.html">this
post</a>. The MM2 version was their 4e debut, and it’s mostly identical (math
fixes aside). The only difference is that they lack the powerful <strong>melt</strong> attack
and instead have a <strong>Mercurial Body</strong> trait which allows them to ignore
difficult terrain and opportunity attacks when moving.</p>

<h2 id="gray-ooze">Gray Ooze</h2>

<p>Gray Oozes are another D&amp;D classic. They’re about as runny as green slimes, but
more mobile, which means they have always been depicted as active
monsters. Their brand of slime is particularly good at dissolving bones, and
they feed on the resulting bone slurry.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they’re Level 2 Skirmishers with 43 HP. Their <strong>stench</strong> acts as
an aura (2) that inflicts a -2 attack penalty on creatues inside. They have 5
acid resistance, crawl with a Speed of 5, and climb with Speed 3.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is named <strong>Bone Melt</strong>, targetting fortitude and dealing some
acid damage. Each hit also inflicts a cumulative -2 penalty to Fortitude, making
further hits likely. A successful save clears the entire penalty. They can also
shift 2 squares as a minor action, making them quite mobile.</p>

<h2 id="green-slime">Green Slime</h2>

<p>Another monster that appeared in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/09/02/ooze.html">Monster Vault</a>, the two versions are
more or less identical. The MV one is a bit simpler to use, though, so prefer
that one if you have the book.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Oozes aren’t smart enough to understand the concept of alliances, but they’re
everywhere in the world of D&amp;D. You don’t need any complex excuses to add an
ooze or three to any underground encounter.</p>

<p>Our example encounters for these entry are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 2 green slimes and 2 gray oozes lounging around a lone ankheg’s lair.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 2 black puddings and a darkmantle enveloper in accidental
cooperation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 19: An aboleth overseer and two lashers with an entourage of 10
skum. This is that packed room I told you about.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As mentioned in my post about <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/08/17/oni.html">Monster Manual oni</a>, oni have been in D&amp;D
since the beginning, but were only called by this name starting in 4e. Before,
they were called by the more generic name of “ogre mage”.</p>

<p>There are many different stories about oni in Japanese folklore. The entries
here in the MM2 are inspired by by some of them.</p>

<p>All oni in this entry are Natural Humanoids, and all but one are Large. They
have darkvision and a signature trait named <strong>Deceptive Veil</strong> that allows them
to appear as any Medium or Large humanoid. Those trying to spot the disguise
need to win an opposed Insight test against the monster’s Bluff.</p>

<h2 id="oni-devourer">Oni Devourer</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-oni-devourer.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These oni are sorcerous tricksters. By day they take the shape of ascetics,
beggars and priests. By night they go out hunting for people to eat. Some
stories tell of a large group of oni devourers that took over an entire isolated
monastery, replacing all the monks and using the disguise to terrorize the
neighboring regions. Devourers can also be found in the service of more powerful
villains as advisors or “court magicians”.</p>

<p>Devourers are the only Medium oni in this entry, and are Level 7 Soldiers with
78 HP. An Oni Devourer likely approaches its target in disguise using its
<strong>Deceptive Veil</strong> (which only lets them take Medium forms since they’re
Medium). Then it uses <strong>Hypnotic Glare</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will) that pulls the
target 5 squares and dazes it (save ends). Once in melee range it’s going to use
<strong>Devour</strong> to deal heavy damage and inflict a -5 penalty to the target’s saves,
and its basic <strong>claw</strong> attack to damage and slow, preventing the victim from
escaping.</p>

<p>An open fight will likely see the oni in its natural form from the start, but
the general tactic will be the same. Despite not having a marking mechanic like
other Soldiers they end up being quite sticky with their daze/slow/save penalty
combination.</p>

<h2 id="oni-overlord">Oni Overlord</h2>

<p>In some stories oni aren’t subtle at all and instead lead gangs of monstrous
bandits that try to rob and devour any hapless protagonists they come
across. Oni Overlords are an attempt to translate those individuals to
D&amp;D. They’re Level 12 Elite Brutes with the Leader keyword and 296 HP.</p>

<p>Oni Overlords lead through fear: their <strong>Threatening Leader</strong> aura (5) gives a
+5 damage bonus to all allies inside, but also deals 5 psychic damage to them
when they miss all targets with an attack. If you want to mitigate that downside
you should give them allies capable of making area attacks. Conversely, if an
ally damages an enemy, the overlord can use its reaction for a <strong>Violent
Reward</strong> that gives that ally 5 temporary HP.</p>

<p>While closing to melee range, the overlord can use <strong>Overlord’s Blast</strong> (close
blast 5 vs. Fortitude; recharges when first bloodied) to deal necrotic and
poison damage to enemies, and also make them vulnerable to those two damage
types (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="oni-thunderer">Oni Thunderer</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-oni-thunderer.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Oni Thunderer. Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Oni Thunderers seem to be inspired by the myth of <a href="https://www.japan-talk.com/jt/new/raijin-and-fujin">Raijin</a>, the god of
thunder and storms, who according to the link looked kinda oni-ish and caused
trouble as often as he helped.</p>

<p>These oni are extremely strong but not divine. There’s usually nothing good
about them, either. They love a fight, and when they get into one they
complement their weapon attacks with thunder magic and teleportation. Their
weapon of choice seems to be a spiked chain, likely inspired by Raijin’s
drum-aura thing. I imagine they usually hang out with other rowdy epic
storm-based creatures.</p>

<p>Thunderers are Large Natural Humanoids, and Level 22 Skirmishers with 206
HP. They have dark vision, a ground speed of 8, and a teleport speed of 8
(meaning they can teleport at-will with a move action).</p>

<p>Their oversized <strong>spiked chains</strong> are Reach 3, do a mix of physical and thunder
damage, and pull the target adjacent to the oni on a hit.</p>

<p>Their teleport speed already makes them hard to pin down, and they can use them
as part of a <strong>Thunderclap Portal</strong> maneuver (recharge 4+). This lets them
teleport their speed and perform a special attack either before or after that
teleport. This is a close burst 2 that heavy thunder damage and pushes all
enemies in the area. An enemy who was grabbed by the oni’s chain takes even more
damage, though this ends the grab.</p>

<p>When hit by an attack, the thunderer can react with <strong>Chain Dance</strong> and teleport
3 squares. Finally, they have the same Deceptive Veil power as all the other
oni, though they’re unlikely to use it often.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get a mix of encounters here illustrting the sort of monsters oni might see
as servants, equals, or masters depending on their relative power levels.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: 2 oni devourers, 1 oni night haunter, 1 troll. Your typical cannibal
giant gang.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: 1 oni overlord, 3 minotaur warriors, 2 scytheclaw drakes. These look
more like a bandit leader and his lieutenants, likely running a gang of humans
or other smaller humanoids.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 2 death giants, 3 oni thunderers. Funny, I’d have expected storm
giants. But this does prevent the PCs from totally nerfing the encounter with
a single damage resistance power.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I like the variety of oni we’re getting here. A large body of legend demands
lots of different stat blocks covering different aspects of it.</p>

            <p>Nothics first appeared in the Miniatures Handbook for 3e, and make their 4e
debut in the MM2.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Nothics are aberrant creatures that first arrived in the world aboard drifting
fragments of the Far Realm. Their minds are even more alien than those of slaads
to us poor mortals. Their huge eyes are capable of inflicting a variety of
afflictions, and they tend to be found in the service of other powerful
creatures. Nothics constantly cackle and cavort about, which their masters often
find amusing, but they also fight at their command, doing double duty as jesters
and bodyguards.</p>

<p>Their masters aren’t necessarily aberrant! Nothics are often found in the
company of undead, for example. A few get adopted by cults of Vecna and receive
numerous blessings from the lich god, becoming even more dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Nothics are Medium Aberrant Humanoids. Those dinner plate eyes give them
Truesight out to 10 squares and Darkvision. They also act as the focus for a
variety of gaze attacks and psychic powers, which vary per stat block. Nothics
have a ground speed of 6.</p>

<p>The stat blocks in this entry range from the mid-Paragon to the early Epic
tiers. I believe the Neverwinter Campaign Setting, published much later, would
include a heroic-tier nothic as well.</p>

<h3 id="nothic-cackler">Nothic Cackler</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-nothic-cackler.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Cacklers are some of the most “jester-like” in behavior. They caper about even
during a battle, seemingly oblivious to the opposition even as they
fight. They’re level 15 Artillery with 116 HP.</p>

<p>Their basic melee attack is an anemic <strong>claw</strong> - it’s all about the mind
powers with them. They can choose between two at-will ranged attacks.</p>

<p>The first, <strong>Mind Rot</strong> targets Will and does psychic damage. On a hit, it also
slides the target 6 squares and forces them to make a melee basic attack against
someone else (nothic’s choice). The other, <strong>Rotting Gaze</strong>, targets Fortitude,
does necrotic damage, and inflicts a -2 penalty to all defenses (save ends).</p>

<p>Tactics are clear: rot the body, rot the mind, laugh, repeat.</p>

<p>If surrounded, the cackler can use a <strong>Maddening Cackle</strong> (close burst 3
vs. Will; enemies only; recharge 5+). This deals psychic damage, pushes 2
squares, and slides the hit targets 2 additional squares at the start of their
next turns.</p>

<h3 id="nothic-mindblight">Nothic Mindblight</h3>

<p>Behavior-wise, mindblights are the complete opposite of cacklers, appearing
sleepy and morose even while staring you to death. They’re level 19 Controllers
with 180 HP. They project an <strong>Eye Lure</strong> aura (3) that slides enemies inside 2
squares at the start of the enemies’ turns. Their <strong>claws</strong> are a little
stronger and also deal ongoing necrotic damage (save ends), but the eye powers
are still the main event.</p>

<p>A mindblight will likely open up with <strong>Mesmerizing Visage</strong> (recharge 5+), a
fireball-sized area attack that targets Will, does psychic damage, and inflicts
a -1 penalty to saves (save ends). The penalty worsens to -3 after the first
failed save.</p>

<p>Then it will move on to its at-will powers, which deal no damage but have “save
ends” riders that capitalize on the Visage’s effect. <strong>Eye of Insanity</strong> is a
Ranged 5 attack that targets will and dominates with an after-effect that dazes
the target for an additionall turn after they make their save. <strong>Necrotic Eye</strong>
is a Close Blast 5 that targets Fortitude and inflicts 10 ongoing necrotic
damage (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="nothic-eye-of-vecna">Nothic Eye of Vecna</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-nothic-eye-of-vecna.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For some reason, Vecna likes this nothic sub-species and heaps blessings upon
them. They often hang around his cults. They’re Level 22 Lurkers with 162 HP,
and project a <strong>Soul Decay</strong> aura (3) that allows allied undead inside to make
free melee basic attacks at the start of the nothic’s turn. So yeah, the best
place for this lurker to lurk is amid a crowd of undead melee bruisers.</p>

<p>The Eye of Vecna is going to constantly emit pulses of <strong>Eye Rot</strong> (minor
action), which targets the fortitude of every enemy within 10 squares and makes
the nothic invisible to them on a hit (save ends). This recharges when the
monster isn’t invisible to anyone.</p>

<p>After it does that, it skitters among the enemies who can’t see it using
<strong>Mobile Melee Attack</strong>, which allows it to move its speed and make a basic claw
attack at any point during the move, drawing no opportunity attacks from the
target. That <strong>Claw</strong> is pretty nasty on its own as well, dealing necrotic
damage, immobilizing, and inflicting a -2 to all saving throws. <strong>Invisible
Advantage</strong> gives it an additional effect against targets who can’t see the
nothic, opening the target up to an opportunity attack from another adjacent
monster.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think the basic visual design of the nothic is quite striking, but their
mechanics don’t quite do it for me just from reading them. I guess they might
feel differently in play.</p>

<p>Encounters with nothics are also likely to involve the powerful villains they
serve. The book gives us three:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: A mind flayer infiltrator with an entourage of 2 nothic cacklers and
2 war trolls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: 2 aboleth lashers and their 2 pet mindblights in cahoots with a
death hag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 21: A dark naga with an honor guard of 3 bodak reavers and an Eye of
Vecna pet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I believe the Neogi first appeared as an element of 2e’s Spelljammer setting. In
4e, they make their debut here in the MM2.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Neogi are bizarre-looking spider-centipede people who originally hail from the
Far Realm. Their culture is a particularly cruel and pitiless variety of
imperialist capitalism. Ownership is all - the strong rule and own the
weak. They organize themselves in clans with slavery-based internal
hierarchies. A given neogi literally owns their immediate underlings and is in
turn a slave to its immediate superior. This goes up all the way to the Great
Old Master of the clan, who is no one’s slave. Neogi are a single-gendered
species without any concept of family. All of the clan’s eggs are carried and
gestated by the Great Old Master.</p>

<p>Neogi are renowned both as traders and slavers, following the same school of
commerce made famous during Earth’s Age of “Discovery”. If the other party is
weaker than you, rob and enslave them. If they’re equivalent or stronger,
negotiate and trade. They just love trading with similarly unsavory people like
devils, duergar, and drow. The only ones they avoid are the mind flayers, since
the entire neogi people was once enslaved by entities similar to flayers back in
the Far Realm.</p>

<p>For some reason, the MM2 doesn’t mention any of their nautical proclivities. I
guess this part of the Astral Sea wasn’t quite as fixed in the authors’ minds
back them. But since later descriptions would reveal you can pretty much
transplant all of Spelljammer directly into the Astral Sea, you can bet you have
Neogi trade/slave/warships roaming that plane.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Neogi are Aberrant Magical Beasts. Most are Medium, but Masters are Large. Their
levels cover the first half of Paragon Tier, making them appropriate encounters
for the Underdark or Astral Sea. Like all monsters, their level can be adjusted
if you want to feature them earlier or later. They usually have climb speeds and
darkvision, and a degree of telepathy. They also speak Common and Deep
Speech.</p>

<p>All Neogi are immune to the Dazed condition. Their attacks are usually some sort
of psychic power, though the exact effects vary per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="neogi-slaver">Neogi Slaver</h3>

<p>A relatively “typical” individual, likely found as crew in an astral vessel or
as troops in raiding party. In either case, they’re likely to be accompanied by
plenty of non-neogi slaves. These are some of the few monsters in the book who
would make use of the “non-lethal takedown” rule, where you can decide someone
you took to 0 HP is not dead, just unconscious. After all, dead slaves are worth
nothing.</p>

<p>Slavers are Level 10 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 106 HP. They have a
ground speed of 8 and a climb speed of 6 with Spider Climb. Their basic melee
attack is a weak <strong>bite</strong> with an ongoing poison damage rider. The first failed
save against this poison also slows the victim (save ends both).</p>

<p>Their main ranged attack is a <strong>Charm Bolt</strong> that targets Will. Instead of
dealing damage, it inflicts a -2 penalty on any attacks that don’t include the
slaver as a target (save ends). After the first failed save, the slaver
also becomes invisible to the target of the bolt!</p>

<p>Their other attack is <strong>Psychic Shackle</strong> (Recharge 5+), a Close Blast 3 that
targets Will, deals psychic damage, and dazes those it hits for a turn.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, they can also use <strong>Thrall Goad</strong> as a minor action. This
allows all allies within 6 squares of the slaver to make a saving thrown with a
+5 bonus.</p>

<h3 id="neogi-spawn-swarm">Neogi Spawn Swarm</h3>

<p>Neogi larvae are tiny and sub-sapient. Their only desire is to eat all nearby
available meat, living or not. They can be dangerous in large numbers, which is
what this stat block represents.</p>

<p>The Swarm counts as a Medium Level 10 Brute with 131 HP. They have the standard
swarm resistance to melee and ranged attacks, and a vulnerability to close and
area attacks. Their ground and climb speeds are both 6.</p>

<p>Their Swarm Attack aura (1) deals automatic poison damage, and their <strong>bites</strong>
are similar to that of the neogi slaver but deal more damage. When first
bloodied or when slain, the swarm lets out a collective <strong>psychic scream</strong> that
attacls a close burst 1 and deals psychic damage with a Daze rider.</p>

<h3 id="neogi-great-old-master">Neogi Great Old Master</h3>

<p>These Large individuals rule over entire clans, and carry all of the clan’s eggs
and larval broods in their immense abdomens. They’re Level 16 Controllers with
157 HP, a ground speed of 6, and a climb speed of 4.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 3 <strong>Scythe Claw</strong> that damages targets and knocks
them prone. Their main ranged attack is an <strong>Enslaving Bolt</strong> that targets Will,
deals psychic damage and inflicts one of those progressively worsening
conditions. The immediate effect is that the target gets a -2 penalty to any
attacks that target the Master; after the first failed save, that worsens to a
Dominate effect; and after the second the domination lasts until the target’s
next extended rest. Yes, this does mean that an unlucky PC could find themselves
trying to avenge the Master even after it’s been killed by the party.</p>

<p>When the Master is first bloodied, its abdomen ruptures and releases a Larva
Burst. This works as a Close Burst 2 against Reflex that deals physical damage
and creates a zone of difficult terrain that lasts until the end of the
encounter. This could also be a good opportunity to introduce a Spawn Swarm to
the fight if the GM is feeling sadistic.</p>

<p>Finally, they can use a version of the Slaver’s Psychic Shackle that deals more
damage and has a wider area.</p>

<p>Myconids have been in the game since AD&amp;D as one of its most famous “novelty
humanoids”. They make their 4e debut here in the MM2.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Myconids are sapient fungal humanoids who originated in the Feywild. The
fomorians did <em>something</em> to them in the distant past, and they still bear the
scars of that corruption. In our narrative present they can be found in deep
caves or the Underdark both in the world and in the Feywild. Their preferred
environment are underground mushroom forests that provide them with a complete
ecosystem to live in, but they also have an instinctive need to multiply and
spread and so can be found in less ideal conditions as well.</p>

<p>Myconids communicate by releasing special spores laced with emotions and
sensations, which only other myconids can understand. Only one individual in
each of their colonies, known as the “Sovereign”, can communicate with outsiders
through telepathy.</p>

<p>These mushroom-people aren’t evil, but their expansionist instinct, difficulty
with communication, and the fact that they live in the friggin’ <em>Underdark</em>
means they tend to engage in conflict with anyone they come across. They often
end up enslaved by drow, fomorians, and shadar-kai.</p>

<p>Peaceful interaction with myconids is predictably hard - you have to reach the
sovereign, which means infiltrating the heart of their territory or letting
yourself be captured and hoping they take you there.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Myconids are Fey Humanoids with the Plant keyword. Sovereigns are Large,
everyone else is Medium. They have Tremorsense 10, which allows them to operate
well in total darkness. Their signature trait is <strong>Roots of the Colony</strong>, a free
action that triggers when they’re hit by an attack and allows them to split half
the damage between themselves and a myconid ally within 5 squares. Given they’re
level 3-4, this is likely to be the party’s first encounter with something
resistant to focus fire.</p>

<h3 id="myconid-rotpriest">Myconid Rotpriest</h3>

<p>Myconid culture isn’t well-understood enough for people to know if they worship
something, but rotpriests kinda fulfill the “healer” role usually taken up by
clerics in other species. They do so in a much more self-sacrificing way,
though.</p>

<p>Rotpriests are Level 3 Brutes with the Leader keyword and 48 HP. They have a
speed of 5, and Regeneration 5 that can be temporarily disabled by radiant
damage. They fight with <strong>stipe staffs</strong> in melee and can also release
<strong>decomposing sprays</strong> to deal necrotic damage in a Close Burst 3.</p>

<p>They have Roots of the Colony like every other myconid, and when another myconid
uses this ability to deal damage to them, rotpriests can use <strong>Sacrifice for the
Colony</strong> to take all of the damage from the trigerring attack instead of just
half. The idea is that they then heal this using their regeneration.</p>

<p>When they finally get killed, they release a <strong>Life Burst</strong> that heals every
living creature in a Close Burst 1 for 10 HP. This includes both monsters and
PCs!</p>

<h3 id="myconid-sovereign">Myconid Sovereign</h3>

<p>Each colony has one of these acting as its leader. As mentioned before,
sovereigns are the only myconids with any ability to communicate with
outsiders. They’re Level 4 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 58 HP. If
forced into a fight they can defend themselves with <strong>Slams</strong> and with a variety
of interesting spore bursts.</p>

<p>The default <strong>Spore Burst</strong> is a close blast 3 that targets the Will of
nonplants and deals poison damage. There’s also <strong>Commanding Spores</strong>, which
allows a plant ally within 5 squares to shift 1 square. Sounds like a waste of a
standard action, but it can set up some interesting flanks.</p>

<p>A Sovereign should stay a bit away from the main scrum, spraying it with its
spore pesticides and helping keep the PCs surrounded.</p>

<h3 id="myconid-guard">Myconid Guard</h3>

<p>Though it’s the last monster in the entry, guards are likely to be the most
numerous foes the party meets. They’re the rank and file of the colony’s
protectors. Guards are Level 4 Soldiers with 56 HP.</p>

<p>They fight with <strong>spiny strikes</strong> from their fists, and can release
<strong>pacification spores</strong> in a close burst 1 that target enemies’ Wills, do poison
damage, and prevent those hit from taking standard actions during their next
turns. Fortunately, this is only an encounter power. Roots of the Colony is the
last trick on their arsenal.</p>

<p>Front-liners are going to have a bit of a bad time facing down myconid guards,
since the guards can stagger their spore releases to keep the PCs from attacking
for a while.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Myconids can live in any place that provides good conditions to mundane fungi,
such as damp caverns, surface forests, and so on. Encounters with them can
involve any wildlife that also lives in these places, either as “third parties”
or perhaps as pets if the wildlife is also fungal. They can also be found
alongside the several people who enslave their colonies, though in that case you
might need to perform some level adjustments.</p>

<p>The sample encounters are an all-myconid party that has just ran into a
deathjump spider (level 3); a pair of myconid guards minding an arbalester for
their bosses near a patch of green slime (level 4); and a geonid accompanied by
a pair of rust monsters and another of rotpriests (level 5).</p>

<p>I like these mushroom people, and I like making then relatively friendly once
the PCs manage to breach the communications gap.</p>
