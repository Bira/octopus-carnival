<p>Grells have been around since at least the 2e Monstrous Manual. In Fourth,
they’re only on the MM, but they got an update in Dungeon 192.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These beaked, tentacled brain-things live and hunt in the Underdark. Like a lot
of monsters in this book they’re carnivores who don’t mind if their prey is
sapient. Though blind, they perceive the world through their latent psychic
powers.</p>

<p>Grells are sapient, but lone grells tend to lead a feral existence and behave
pretty much like clever pretadors. Those tend to be exceptions, though. Grell
most often organize themselves in hive-like colonies with dozens of individuals,
led by the most intelligent and powerful among them. These colonies are
expansionist, though they tend to see their territory more as a hunting ground
than as any sort of empire. Grell colonies don’t go for subtle manipulation,
either.</p>

<p>Grells have a venomous bite, and venomous spines on the tips of their
tentacles. Their leaders are called Philosophers, and have stronger psychic
powers on top of that.</p>

<p>One interesting fact added by the Dungeon update is that brains are poisonous to
grells! They’ll eat every other bit of their victims, but will either discard
the brains or keep them in reserve for trade if there’s a mind flayer colony
near their territory.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Grells are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts who lack eyes and thus are immune to
gaze attacks. They have Blindsight 12 and fly with speed 6 (hover). A grounded
grell is reduced to a ground speed of 1 (clumsy). They’re Evil, communicate via
Deep Speech, and are trained in Stealth and Perception.</p>

<h3 id="grell">Grell</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 7 Elite Soldier with 156 HP. Its basic attack is a
Tentacle Rake (Melee 2 vs. AC) using those spines, and while it does the damage
expected by the new math that’s only because the designers went with the “one
double-damage attack” approach for this elite monster. In addition to doing
damage, the tentacles slow the target and give it a -2 penalty to attacks (save
ends both).</p>

<p>Instead of raking, the grell can attempt a Tentacle Grab (Melee 2 vs. Fortitude)
which does a bit less damage than the rake and grabs the target. The grell can
only grab one victim at a time, and enjoys a +2 bonus to AC while it’s grabbing
someone.</p>

<p>As a 1/round minor action, the grell can use its Venomous Bite (vs. AC) against
a grabbed victim, dealing a bit of physical damage and stunning them (save
ends).</p>

<p>You can expect a grell to be able to keep one PC stunlocked and the rest of them
slowed. The update gives them two attacks per turn, each of which can be a
Tentacle Rake or a Tentacle Grab. They retain their stunning bite, but the stun
also ends when the grab does in addition to being (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="grell-philosopher">Grell Philosopher</h3>

<p>Philosophers are Level 11 Elite Controllers with 224 HP. They have Resist 20
Lightning on top of the common grell’s traits. Their basic attack is still the
tentacle rake, whose damage is only 1 point higher than that of a standard
grell.</p>

<p>They have a ranged attack in the form of a Lightning Lance (Ranged 10
vs. Reflex) which does lightning damage and blinds (save ends). If there are a
lot of PCs nearby they can instead use their Venomous Mind (Close Burst 3
vs. Will, enemies only) which does psychic damage and forces its victims to
choose random targets for any melee attacks they make (save ends). I love these
unique conditions.</p>

<p>Occasionally the philosopher will be able to cause a Psychic Storm (Area Burst 2
within 10 vs. Will; recharge 6) which does psychic damage and dazes (save
ends). The storm lingers as a zone until the end of the encounter, dazing anyone
caught within (save ends).</p>

<p>Psychic storm is always available at the beginning of the fight, so that’s going
to be the opener almost every time. It’s not a “friendly” area, so some care is
required in its placement. Venomous mind is an excellent power to use on the PCs
stunlocked by the philosopher’s underlings.</p>

<p>The dungeon update left them pretty much identical, aside from the usual damage
improvements.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s one grell encounter here, which is level 11: a philosopher, 2 standard
grells, and 4 troglodyte minions. The lore didn’t give me the impression grells
would work alongside anyone else, but the troglodyte association here is
interesting. This works as a good boss battle for level 8-9 characters.</p>

<p>I think grells are a lot more interesting when they’re in colonies. As lone
feral predators they’re interchangeable with a lot of other tentacled Underdark
beasties.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed is that 2e seems to have described them as having a higher
level of technology: they worn spear-tips on their tentacles, used magic items,
and the Lightning Lance was an actual weapon instead of a psychic power. I
wonder how much stress this caused GMs whose players looted a bunch of +5 rings
and rayguns from a group of grells. So in that way it’s a good thing that these
things are no longer in the game. Still, if you’re looking for some treasure to
assign to a grell encounter, these items might be a good inspiration.</p>

<p>2e used to also have Grell Patriarchs as the “tier” above
Philosophers. Patriarchs were large sapient masses of flesh that acted as the
core of spelljammer vessels. If you’re including spelljamming in your campaign
you could bring them back.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>In Greek mythology, the Gorgons are a trio of sisters whose bodies were partly
composed of snakes and whose visage could turn people to stone. Medusa was one
of the Gorgons (the other were Stheno and Euryale). If you say the word “Gorgon”
to anyone, they’ll probably think of Medusa, unless they’re D&amp;D players.</p>

<p>D&amp;D uses the word “Medusa” as a species name for the snake-haired ladies, and
“Gorgon” for these carapaced cows with a poison breath. They, in turn, are based
on a monster from medieval European folklore whose poison gas came out of the
other end. They appear only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>There isn’t much to go on here. Gorgons are elemental beasts known for their
foul temper and deadly breath weapons. In the wild they roam in small herds of
3-7 individuals made up of one bull and his harem of cows. Young males acquire a
herd by challenging and defeating its current bull. Those who fail at this roam
alone or in pairs and are likely even more aggressive than usual.</p>

<p>Taming gorgons is quite hard, but it happens. Those who most often succed at it
are other elemental creatures, particularly giants.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gorgons are Large Elemental Beasts whose signature traits are Truesight and a
complete immunity to forced movement and being knocked prone. They also have a
breath weapon of some sort, though its effect varies with the stat block.</p>

<h2 id="iron-gorgon">Iron Gorgon</h2>

<p>This is the one that’s closest to the “classic” D&amp;D gorgon of editions
past. It’s a Level 11 Soldier with 120 HP and the common traits listed above. It
has the Earth keyword, runs at Speed 6 with Earth Walk, and is immune to
petrification.</p>

<p>The iron gorgon’s basic attack is a Gore, though I imagine it will most often
Trample instead. This allows it to move its speed, go through enemy spaces, and
perform an attack against any enemy whose space they go through. This is a
little weaker than the gore but will likely target multiple PCs. The movement
draws opportunity attacks as normal.</p>

<p>Ocasionally, the iron gorgon will perform an Earthshaking Charge (recharge 5-6),
which does more damage than the basic attack and pushes a Medium or smaller
target 3 squares, also knocking it prone.</p>

<p>Finally, it can use the Petrifying Breath that made it famous (Close blast 3
vs. Fortitude; recharge 6). It does poison damage, dazes and slows (save
ends). This worsens to immobilized on the first failed saved, and to permanent
petrification on the second. Other gorgons are immune to this breath weapon,
which means they don’t have to worry about friendly fire when you fight the
whole herd.</p>

<h2 id="storm-gorgon">Storm Gorgon</h2>

<p>Explicitly called out as the favorite herd animal of storm titans, the mighty
storm gorgon is a Level 26 Skirmisher with 248 HP and all traits listed
above. To them it adds a Tempest’s Fury aura (size 5) that does 20 lightning
damage to anyone caught inside, which is impressive even for an epic
creature. It also has 20 lightning and thunder resistance, runs at Speed 8 and
flies at Speed 10 with hover capability.</p>

<p>Its basic gore attack does a mix of physical and thunder damage, and also always
pushes the target 2 squares and knocks it prone on a hit. It can use that as
part of a Mobile Melee Attack where it moves its speed without drawing
opportunity attacks and makes an attack at any point in this movement. They can
also Trample like iron gorgons if they want to spread the hurt more widely.</p>

<p>Their breath is a storm (Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude), which does a whole bunch
of lignthing and thunder damage but doesn’t have any riders.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter here is level 27: 2 storm gorgons, 1 storm titan, and 2
dragonborn champions. I imagine this is a lord taking a walk with his favored
pets and their minders. Yes, the Dragonborn Champions are pet minders - anyone
less tough would be killed by those storm auras.</p>

<p>Confusing naming conventions aside, I quite like these deadly bovines. They’re
in dire need of a damage fix, of course, and I would probably shift the
conditions on the iron gorgon’s petrifying breath around. Something like slowed
-&gt; immobilized and dazed -&gt; petrified.</p>

<p>How about some fan-made gorgon lore? I imagine they’re native to the Elemental
Chaos, and were brought to the world by the giants way back when. Wild specimens
can be found in both planes, descended from escaped members of giant herds who
went back to nature.</p>

<p>While storm gorgons (below) are explicitly called out as being a favorite of
storm titans, I imagine hill giants would be just as fond of iron
gorgons. Those groups who grow adept at gorgon ranching have less reason to raid
neighboring settlements for food. Their territories might be full of giant-sized
statues left over from the process of becoming adept at gorgon-ranching too.</p>

<p>You know who else might be good at herding gorgons? The githzerai. They’d have
to be if they use animal products at all. Normal cattle would have trouble
surviving in the Elemental Chaos.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/05/03/superheavy-weapons.html">&#39;Superheavy&#39; Melee Weapons in GURPS</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Over- and undersized weapons are a popular trope for fantasy and
fantasy-adjacent stories. Those giants and pixies need something to fight with,
and human-scale warriors with huge swords is a itself a popular genre trope.</p>

<p>GURPS already has a pretty good set of cinematic rules for representing
these. The best source of these is the <em>Scaling Weapons and Armor</em> section found
in <strong>GURPS Low-Tech Companion 2: Weapons and Warriors</strong>. GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
uses a limited subset of those in DF1 and 3.</p>

<p>However, there are a few other tropes that mess around with weapon weights in a
supernatural way. Let’s take a look at how to represent them in GURPS.</p>

<h2 id="superheavy-weapons">Superheavy Weapons</h2>

<p>This is a melee weapon that’s the same size as its mundane counterpart, but it’s
a lot <em>heavier</em>. It’s probably made out of a non-standard material, which
depending on the weapon might be a fruit of superscience or magic. Such weapons
are usually built for legendarily strong wielders! The increased weight not only
makes the weapons more deadly, but also allows its owner to employ their full
strength when fighting.</p>

<p>To model these weapons, use the Scaling Weapons and Armor rules, with a few
modifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Either pick a final weight for the weapon, or note the strength of its
intended wielder if you already know that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to page 21 of Low-Tech Companion 2, and pick the line whose “Typical User
ST” column most closely matches that of the wielder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you started with the weight, divide final weight by the “base” weight of
the weapon and pick the line whose Weight column is closest to the result.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modify the weapon’s Damage, required ST, Weight and base cost as written in
LTC2. <em>Do not</em> modify Reach or SM.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And there you have it! And yes, you can combine this with normal weapon scaling
to make a weapon whose weight is abnormally large for its size. In that case,
two extra steps apply after completing the procedure above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Multiply the weapon’s Reach by the value in the table row corresponding to the
SM of the intended wielder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cost is the <em>higher</em> of the weapon’s final modified cost, or the cost of a
standard SM 0 weapon.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: We’re making a super-strong martial artist character and we want
him to use an iron quarterstaff that’s ten times heavier than the wooden
variety. Looking at the table on LTC2 p. 21, we see that the closest multiplier
is 12.25, for the SM+3 line.</p>

<p>After applying the modified process above, we end up with a weapon that has the
following qualities: Damage sw+7 cr or thr+7 cr; Reach 1, 2; Parry +2; Cost
$122,50; Weight 20kg (40 lbs); ST 25. So our hero would need at least ST 25 to
properly wield such a weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: We’re making a pixie barbarian using Dungeon Fantasy rules. Her
ST is 13, which is legendary for a people whose SM is -6 and whose typical ST
score is 5. We want her to wield a weapon that’s superheavy <em>for a pixie</em>.</p>

<p>The chosen base weapon is a Dueling Halberd. We use the SM -6 row in the table
for the halberd’s Reach multiplier, and the SM -2 row for everything else. Our
resulting halberd will weight only a quarter of the human version, but it will
be 25 times heavier than a “standard” pixie polearm, and weight more than its
wielder! Since its modified cost of $30 is lower than its base cost of $150, it
costs the same as a full-sized halberd.</p>

<p>The final stats are: Damage sw+2 cut or sw+2 imp or thr+2 imp; Reach C; Parry 0U
or 0; Cost $150; Weight 1.25kg (2.5 lbs); ST 6++. Note that our super-strong
pixie can wield this halberd one-handed without it becoming unready.</p>

<h2 id="magically-attuned-weapons">Magically Attuned Weapons</h2>

<p>This trope is popular in the Exalted roleplaying game. Magic weapons in that
setting are based both on some tales of classical mythology and on modern media
such as action anime and certain video games. The heroes who wield these weapons
“attune their essence” to them, which makes the weapons feel like they have
normal weight to their owners, while still being superheavy to everyone else -
particularly their targets.</p>

<p>This means that characters wielding these weapons don’t have to be generically
super-strong, and that the ability to handle one weapon doesn’t give them the
ability to wield others.</p>

<p>To create such a weapon, use the same process outlined above for “superheavy”
weapons. Attunement is represented by a new advantage, which the weapon’s owner
must purchase in order to use it.</p>

<h3 id="attunement-variable-cost">Attunement (Variable Cost)</h3>

<p>You’re attuned to a specific magical weapon which is super-heavy, oversized, or
both. You can wield it just as if it was a normal-sized weapon, though its
targets will still feel the full weight of your blows.</p>

<p>To calculate the cost of this advantage, subtract your actual ST from the
weapon’s minimum ST and multiply it by 1.6, rounding up. Add 1 to the total if
the weapon is also oversized.</p>

<p>Attunement in no way “protects” your weapon! If it’s permanently lost or
destroyed, you lose all the points invested in it.</p>

<p><em>Details</em>: This is just enough levels of Lifting and Striking ST with the
limitation “Only for this weapon” (-80%) to cover the difference between the
character’s ST score and the minimum ST for the weapon. The extra point for
oversized weapons is a specialized version of the Giant Weapons perk that
removes all penalties due to size difference, but only works for that single
weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: If the Iron Staff from the previous section was a magic artifact in
the style described here, a reedy ST 8 hero could attune to it by paying 28
character points. 25 - 8 is 17, which multiplied by 1,6 gives us 27,5, which is
then rounded up. This allows the hero to fight with the Staff as if he had
ST 25, and to ignore its great weight when carrying it, but he’ll still be ST 8
for all other purposes.</p>

<h2 id="whomsoever-wields-this-hammer-should-he-be-worthy">“Whomsoever wields this hammer, should he be worthy…”</h2>

<p>The third and final special weapon covered in this article are those powerful
magical artifacts that only allow those they deem worthy to even lift
them. Thor’s hammer from the Marvel comics and movies is a famous example.</p>

<p>Lifting and using these weapons is not a matter of muscle mass, but of moral
strength. When you touch them, they judge you! If you pass that judgment, then
you can lift and wield the weapon as if it was a normal specimen of its kind.</p>

<p>You don’t actually need to make these weapons superheavy or oversized. Instead,
they look for certain traits in a prospective wielder. Those who have these
traits are worthy. Those who don’t can’t even lift the weapon, even if they’re
the strongest being in the universe muscle-wise. I generally consider this to be
a story effect and wouldn’t try to put a price tag on it.</p>

<p>A weapon like movie-Mjolnir might look for one or more virtues along the lines
of Honesty, Selfless, Charitable and so on. An evil weapon would instead look
for Bloodlust or Sadism. They would of course also avoid traits opposite to
those they like.</p>

<p>If the weapon in question is also superheavy or oversized, then it could grant
worthy wielders the ST to use it, similar to how Attunement works, at no cost to
the wielder. If you’re writing up the weapon as a character, this would be a
benefficial Affliction granting the Attunement advantage described in the
previous section of this article. Simplify its cost by having it grant a number
of levels of ST equal to the minimum needed to wield the weapon regardless of
the wielder’s current ST.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The Iron Staff belonged to the Monkey King! Though it will shun
Bloodthirsty, Callous, Greedy or Sadistic individuals, it will deem worthy
anyone who shows its former master’s heroic spirit, martial prowess, or love of
mischief. Anyone with at least two of Selfless, a Code of Honor or Higher
Purpose to fight evil, Trained by a Master, Curious, or Trickster could be
deemed worthy and be considered to have ST 25 when wielding the staff.</p>

<p>Like the other goblinoids, bugbears have been in the game since the beginning,
when they were the most powerful of the “proper” humanoids at 3+1 HD. The next
step up from them were ogres, who occupied that nebulous area between “humanoid”
and “giant”.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As we’ve already seen, bugbears are the biggest and strongest members of their
“family”, and tend to organize into small roving bands when by themselves. They
can also be found living alongside goblin communities, which they rule through
fear and frequent beatings.</p>

<p>Bugbears are quite violent and prefer actions to words, which means they never
talk with people they can beat up instead. To get a bugbear to negotiate you
have to show them there’s a clear and obvious advantage to doing so. That could
be because you’re too tough to bully, or because working with you will bring
them more rewards in the long run. They tend to fit into hobgoblin-led forces as
elite shock troops or commandos. Yes, bugbears can be surprisingly sneaky
despite their bulk and predilection for direct violence.</p>

<p>One interesting bit of lore in the MM is that bugbears like to decapitate their
enemies in honor of Hruggek, a culture hero and exarch of Bane who was known for
doing that. That’s quite the feat given that their preferred weapon is the
morningstar.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We only get a total of four bugbear statblocks, two in each book. They’re Medium
Natural Humanoids with low-light vision and Speed 6. All of them also have
training in Stealth. Their signature abilities vary per book.</p>

<p>In the MM they have Predatory Eye, a minor-action encounter power that gives
them a small damage bonus in the next attack they make with combat advantage. In
other words, it’s a crappier Sneak Attack that only works once per encounter.</p>

<p>In the MV this was replaced with the much better Bushwhack, which gives them a
+4 attack bonus against creatures that have no adjacent allies. If you use MM
bugbears, I suggest you replace their Predatory Eye with Bushwhack in addition
to any other changes.</p>

<h3 id="bugbear-thug-mv">Bugbear Thug (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 4 Brute has 65 HP and all common traits for MV bugbears. It fights
with a morningstar whose basic attack has built-in “sneak attack” bonus damage,
and carries 2 handaxes it can throw while it closes the gap with the PCs.</p>

<p>Simple and effective! If attacking an isolated PC from ambush, the thug can
start the fight with a bang, though unlike a full lurker it will not seek to
hide again once that happens.</p>

<h3 id="bugbear-warrior-mm">Bugbear Warrior (MM)</h3>

<p>This Level 5 Brute has 76 HP and all common traits for MM bugbears. It’s likely
an earlier version of the Thug. It also fights with a morningstar.</p>

<p>To go with its weak Predatory Eye ability, the warrior has an encounter power
named Skullthumper. This requires combat advantage and is a morningstar attack
that also knocks the target prone and dazes them (save ends).</p>

<p>I’m guessing it’s also meant to combine these two abilities for that first
strike from ambush. To update it, level a bugbear thug up to 5 and give it
Skullthumper.</p>

<h3 id="bugbear-backstabber-mv">Bugbear Backstabber (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 5 Skirmisher has 63 HP and all MV bugbear traits. It fights with a
greatsword, widely known as a good backstabbin’ weapon. It also carries 4
handaxes for throwing.</p>

<p>In addition to Bushwhack, this bugbear is also an Expert Ambusher, which gives
it a damage bonus when it attacks from hiding. And as an at-will move action it
can employ Stealthy Positioning to shift its speed and make a Stealth check to
hide if it ends behind cover.</p>

<p>These monsters want to ambush the party in a place with lots of cover. They’ll
charge from hiding, hit with the sword while benefitting from Expert Ambusher,
and will immediately use Stealthy Positioning to move back into hiding and do it
again next turn. They’re skirmishers because they can do this every turn,
instead of alternating like a lurker.</p>

<h3 id="bugbear-strangler-mm">Bugbear Strangler (MM)</h3>

<p>These Level 6 Lurkers have 82 HP and were the cause of some early battles in the
edition war.</p>

<p>They fight with a morningstar but keep a rope garrote in reserve. When they have
CA against a target, they can Strangle it (Melee 1 vs. Reflex). A hit does some
damage and grabs the target until they escape. The strangler can use its
subsequent standard actions to automatically deal the same damage to the target.</p>

<p>If someone attacks their AC or Reflex then while they have a victim grabbed in
this way, they can use Body Shield (recharge 4-6) as an interrupt to have the
attack target the victim instead.</p>

<p>This was what caused those battles, since the Strangler was published as a
preview ahead of the game and it was one of the first instances of a “custom” 4e
monster ability people had laid their eyes on. We already saw several monsters
who can do something like this, but since bugbears are relatively “mundane” it
led to some 3.x diehards complaining that there should be feat chains and such
that allowed a PC to do the same.</p>

<h3 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h3>

<p>While only one of the stat blocks depicts an actual lurker, they’re all
well-provided with abilities that allow them to attack from ambush to good
effect. Forget goblins, bugbears are the real sneaky gits here.</p>

<p>Golems have been in the game since the beginning. They became so popular that
they ended up giving rise to the whole construct taxonomy as more things that
were like them were published to capitalize on the hype.</p>

<p>The word itself comes from the myth of the Golem of Prague. Here, golems are
present in both books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Like in pretty much every edition of D&amp;D, golems are humanoid constructs created
by powerful spellcasters or masters of secret lore. They faithfully obey their
creator’s orders and tirelessly follow the last commnand they received if the
creator is not around.</p>

<p>The process of creating a golem is quite involved and expensive. The body must
be crafted to exacting specifications, a process that often involves hired
artisans if the creator doesn’t have the skill themselves. The creator them
performs a complex ritual upon the finished body, opening a small rift to the
Elemental Chaos and pulling a bit of the same spark used by the gods and
primordials to craft the world. This animating spark gives the golem motion and
a desire to obey its creator, and nothing else in the way of personality.</p>

<p>There are several versions of the animating ritual. All require a sacrifice of
treasure plus one of blood or spirit. The more evil the ritual, the less of the
former and more of the latter it requires. The resulting golem itself, however,
is always Unaligned.</p>

<p>While golems are not actually mindless, they’re not really people. A golem has
the ability to understand its master’s orders perfectly, but it can’t speak or
understand anyone else. It also employs very direct and physical approaches to
fulfilling those orders. If a golem is given an order it can’t fulfill, it will
either just stand there or rampage until told to stop. Never try to make your
golem work as an accountant!</p>

<p>Golems really excel when used for their intended purpose, though. They never
tire, never complain, never disobey, and last pretty much forever. They’re hard
enough to make that their creators tend to be people who value those traits
above all else. Maybe it’s a dwarf kingdom who needs eternal guardians for their
treasure vaults. Maybe it’s a tyrannical wizard who wants absolutely loyal
bodyguards who won’t flinch when ordered to dismember someone as an example. And
so on.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The full Golem Lineup got quite large over the editions, but here we get a
limited slice of it to start with. The MM contains flesh and stone golems; the
MV has those two plus iron golems.</p>

<p>I imagine clay golems were left out of the MM because the Eidolons already
filled the “divine construct” niche, and out of the MV because the
Frankenstein-inspired Flesh Golem became more popular.</p>

<p>Most golems are Large Natural Animates with the Construct keyword. Constructs
don’t need to breathe, eat or sleep and don’t count as living creatures, making
them immune to effects that only target the living. All golems also have
darkvision and though they move with Speed 6 they cannot shift. They tend to be
Paragon-tier elite brutes. Everything else varies with the type of golem.</p>

<h3 id="flesh-golem-both">Flesh Golem (Both)</h3>

<p>Flesh golems are inspired by Frankenstein’s monster, and built from corpse
parts. This makes them look like large angry zombies, but they’re explicitly not
undead. I don’t believe they decompose either.</p>

<p>They’re Level 12 Elite Brutes with 304 HP. Unlike all other golems, they are
<em>not</em> immune to disease and poison. They fight with their fists and can perform
two slams per action. When bloodied, they also make additional slam attacks
against a random adjacent target as a reaction to being hit by an attack.</p>

<p>The golem’s other special attack is Golem Rampage, which allows it to move its
Speed+2, pass through enemy squares, and make a slam attack against any enemy
whose square they pass through. This provokes opportunity attacks as normal, and
recharges on a 5-6.</p>

<p>The MV version has all of the same abilties with improved damage, and leans even
harder on the Frankenstein story with two new passive traits. I suppose they’re
also a callback to the extensive list of immunities and weird spell effects
every golem had in previous editions.</p>

<p>Primal Fear causes it to run away from anyone who deals fire damage to it,
moving up to its speed as a free action. If it can’t move at least half that
distance it grants combat advantage for a turn instead. Life-Giving Jolt allows
it to make a free basic attack when it takes lightning damage.</p>

<p>Use the MV version for its numbers, and feel free to remove the new passive
traits if they don’t fit your needs.</p>

<h3 id="stone-golem-both">Stone Golem (Both)</h3>

<p>While flesh golems are the weaker variety, you can say stone golems are the most
basic. They’re Level 17 Elite Brutes with 336 HP, and are immune to disease and
poison.</p>

<p>They fight with slams, and can also make one or two of those per turn. They have
the same Golem Rampage power as the flesh golem, and a Death Burst that triggers
when they die. This explosion is a Close Burst 1 vs. AC doing physical damage
from stone shrapnel, and causing the area to become difficult terrain “until
cleared”.</p>

<p>Aside from fixing the damage bug, the versions in the two books are identical.</p>

<h3 id="iron-golem-mv">Iron Golem (MV)</h3>

<p>Iron golems were the top of the golem ladder until the 3e Epic Level Handbook
came along. It appears in 4e for the first time on the MM2. The iron golem is a
Level 20 Elite Soldier with 386 HP. Like other non-flesh golems it’s immune to
disease and poison.</p>

<p>Iron golems are filled with a self-replenishing reservoir of chemical weapons!
While they’re bloodied, these leak and work like an Aura 2 that deals poison
damage to any creature that enters it or starts their turn inside.</p>

<p>Other elemental magic also has strange effects on them: they can shift 2 squares
when they take fire damage for the first time in a turn (even though they can’t
otherwise shift). When they’re hit with lightning, they’re also slowed for a
turn.</p>

<p>An iron golem’s basic attack is an Iron Blade that does some pretty good damage
and marks on a hit. It can Cleave to make this basic attack against two
different targets. Its other main weapon is a breath weapon that uses those
chemical weapons I mentioned. It’s a Close Blast 3 vs. Fortitude that deals a
big chunk of poison damage and some quite respectable ongoing poison damage
(save ends). It recharges on a 5-6.</p>

<p>When a creature marked by the golem and within 2 squares of it moves, the
creature can use a Dazing Fist as a reaction (Melee 2 vs. Fortitude), which
does no damage but dazes (save ends). And when the golem dies it detonates is
poison gas reservoir, dealing immediate and ongoing poison damage in a Close
Burst 3.</p>

<p>The MM2 iron golem is pretty much identical, though it suffers from the damage
bug and lacks the special fire and lightning effects.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s a single sample encounter here: Level 14, 2 flesh golems and a
lamia. Lamias are one of those people who would have trouble hiring sapient
bodyguards, but no shortage of raw material for flesh golems.</p>

<p>I don’t think I ever ran a fight against a golem but I like that they’re in the
game. I also like that their description here doesn’t even pretend that someone
could confuse a golem with a statue. They look pretty distinctive and are not
subtle enough to stay still when an intruder enters the space they’re guarding.</p>

<p>A 4e golem is much less of a puzzle monster than it used to be in previous
editions, where they had a blanket immunity to magic except for those exotic
effects. 3e already poked some holes into that by making them only immune to
spells that were affected by spell resistance, and 4e did away with it
entirely. It’s understandable - pretty much anything an arcane or divine
character can do against a monster is technically “magic”, so you don’t want to
make half the party completely useless against golems. Also, spell resistance is
not a thing in this edition.</p>
