            <p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>This book includes a whole bunch of demons, and it was inevitable that it was
also going to include a whole bunch of devils. Their base lore remains unchanged
from what it was in my <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2019/11/21/devils.html">original introduction</a> in the Monster Manual Let’s
Read, so I recommend re-reading that article.</p>

<p>This entry includes a whole bunch of devils that are new to 4th edition, though
some of them also appeared in earlier editions. As I mention in the original
intro, devils tend to be more “humanoid” in appearance and use weapons to
fight. I’m also really fond of making jokes about devils being corporate
employees and/or fascists, so get ready for those.</p>

<p>Mechanically, all devils have the Immortal origin, and the Devil keyword. Nearly
all of the ones we’ll look at in this book are Humanoids, with one exception who
is an Animate. All of the devils in the first MM had really high fire
resistance, and some of the ones here do as well, but a surprising number of
them lacks resistances entirely. They all still have darkvision, but their
remaining traits vary a lot per stat block.</p>

<p>As usual, I’ll cover enough individual monsters to hit the size limit I’ve set
on each post, and will have as many parts as it takes to cover the entire
“Devil” entry.</p>

<h2 id="assassin-devil">Assassin Devil</h2>

<figure class="left">

<p>As every servant of Asmodeus knows, you can’t make it in this economy without a
little murder. Assassin devils are specialized service providers that cater to
that particular need of successful businessmen everywhere. Their magic allows
them to manipulate shadows to hide themselves and to kill.</p>

<p>That “service provider” crack isn’t just a joke: assassin devils are always
found assisting the plots of some other infernal muckety-muck, never
masterminding their own. The hidden truth is that many of them report directly
to Asmodeus, snitching on those same plots to keep the CEO abreast of what his
scheming underlings are up to. If the underlings in question discover this, they
rarely make public accusations or reprisals, and instead try to feed the
assassin misinformation to make themselves look good in the eyes of the boss.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Assassin Devils are Medium Level 24 Lurkers with 167 HP. They have darkvision
and Resist 25 Fire, as well as an amazing ground speed of 12. They wear light
armor and fight with shadows.</p>

<p>They can use magic to form a <strong>Shadow Sword</strong> which does necrotic damage and
ongoing 5 physical damage (save ends). It also deals a lot of extra necrotic
damage against targets granting combat advantage to the assassin.</p>

<p>Assassin devils can wrap themselves in a <strong>Shadow Cloak</strong> that makes them
invisible until they make an attack, or they can cast those same shadows as a
<strong>Shadow Net</strong> (Area Burst 2 Within 10 vs. Reflex) that restrains all it hits
and inflicts 10 ongoing necrotic damage. These abilities can’t be used at the
same time. The Cloak recharges when the devil uses the Net, and vice-versa.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounter-and-impressions">Sample Encounter and Impressions</h3>

<p>This seems like the type of devil PCs from the world would rarely see because
they’re almost always employed in the internecine struggles of Hell itself. The
book notes they like to work alone, but if circumstances mandate a team they
prefer to partner up with strong soldier-types like war devils who are good at
keeping the enemy distracted and setting up flanks.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 22 and has 2 assassins, a high-level human
diabolist, and 2 war devils.</p>

<h2 id="erinyes">Erinyes</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-devil-erinyes.png"/>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Erinyes are inspired by the Furies of Greek myth, and have been in the game
since at least 1st Edition. I think it was 3.x that tried to present them as
devilish counterparts to succubi (who were demons in that edition), but 4e leans
more into the “Fury” aspect.</p>

<p>In Fourth Edition, Erinyes act as arbiters and enforcers of infernal law, which
of course also implies they’re pretty good in a fight because this is Hell we’re
talking about. Their skills with sword and shield are so renowned that certain
mortal warriors have been known to sell their souls in order to train under
them. This implies there’s an official erinyes school of arms with their own
signature style, and maybe its own trademark enforcement arm.</p>

<p>In battle, Erinyes are elite infantry of the sort that gets deployed to untangle
tricky situations and inspire the rank and file around them to fight
harder. They’re more or less equivalent to fighty warlords. They can also be
found leading hunting parties whose purpose is to find those who skipped out on
infernal contracts and drag them to Hell.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Erinyes are Medium Level 13 Soldiers with the Leader keyword and 131 HP. They’re
clad in high-quality infernal plate (which is a lot more than they wore in other
editions), and wield a shield and a bastard sword. Their speed is 5, and they
mostly fight using showy but lethal martial techniques.</p>

<p>They’re very good at holding the line due to the <strong>Devastating Opportunist</strong>
trait, which gives them a +3 bonus to opportunity attacks and allows them to
shift 1 square if they hit with such an attack.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Compelling Strike</strong> that does standard physical damage
and allows one ally within 5 squares to gain 8 temporary HP. They can also use
the <strong>Flitting Blade</strong> technique to make attacks dealing light physical damage
against up to three different targets, at-will.</p>

<p>When first bloodied, they can use <strong>Bloody Spiral</strong> (close burst 1 vs. Reflex)
as a reaction. This does a tiny bit of physical damage and knocks prone on a
hit, and if two or more enemies are knocked down it bestows 10 temporary HP to
every ally within 5 squares.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounter-and-impressions-1">Sample Encounter and Impressions</h3>

<p>The sample encounter is level 12 and has 3 erinyes, 2 chain devils and 5 legion
devil hellguards. It’s likely one of those hunting parties.</p>

<p>I think I like these new erinyes a lot more than I did the “naked winged woman,
but a devil” that I remember them being in 3e.</p>

<h2 id="gorechain-devil">Gorechain Devil</h2>

<figure class="center">

</figure>

<p>Like a chain devil, but bigger. Where standard chain devils are jailers,
gorechain devils are more like bounty hunters. They’re named like this because
their chains are often encrusted in gore.</p>

<p>Their fighting style is a lot less acrobatic than that of their smaller
counterparts, but they turn out to have a lot more mental control over their
chains. So much, in fact, that they can use those chains to manipulate ensnared
victims and make them into puppets. They’re also a lot smarter than they look.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-2">The Numbers</h3>

<p>These Large devils are Level 12 Elite Brutes with 298 HP. They have resist 10
fire but seem to lack darkvision. Their speed is 5.</p>

<p>The <strong>Grasping Chains</strong> of a gorechain devil act as an aura (3) that forces
enemies to make a DC 21 Athletics or Acrobatics check if they attempt to leave
its bounds. Their basic <strong>Gorechain Strike</strong> is reach 3, and the <strong>Gorechain
Flail</strong> ability (recharge 6) allows them to make one of these attacks against
every target in range with a single action.</p>

<p><strong>Gorechain Takeover</strong> (reach 3 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6) does about the same
damage as the basic strike, and also dominates (save ends). The domination also
ends if the target is more than 3 squares away from the devil when the target’s
turn starts. A lucky enough series of recharge rolls could see multiple PCs
dominated in this way.</p>

<p>The tactics here are clear: bring all the PCs in for a group hug, and never let
them get away.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounter-and-impressions-2">Sample Encounter and Impressions</h3>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 12 and has two of these, a skeletal tomb guardian,
and a skull lord. I imagine they might also take part in those erinyes-led
debtor-hunting parties.</p>

<p>I like that the look of gorechain devils is a bit deceptive at first. A PC who
sees one of these things might expect a big dumb brute, but they can fight smart
and the Takeover power will come as a surprise.</p>

<p>It’s not quite enough to make me like them as enemies, since I’m not really that
fond of kytons either, but that’s on me and not on this stat block.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>The word “Deva” used to refer to Lawful Good angels in earlier editions, but now
it means something different. Deva as presented here are new to Fourth Edition,
and first appeared as a playable option in the Player’s Handbook 2. They occupy
the same dramatic role as aasimar did in earlier editions, but in my opinion are
much cooler.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In ancient times, a group of good angels decided they liked the world so much
that they would become a part of it. So they assumed mortal form, and the
resulting creatures became known as devas. They have lived countless lives since
then, and still carry some memories of the deep past with them.</p>

<p>A deva begins life by materializing from thin air, fully grown and capable of
both speech and motion on the level of any other adult sapient humanoid. More,
actually, since they also appear with the skills necessary to defend themselves
and others. Few newborns can claim that! Newly-incarnated Deva have vague
memories of their past lives and retain their basic personality, but their slate
is otherwise clean.</p>

<p>It’s no wonder then that a very high percentage of devas end up following
adventuring careers, or otherwise dedicate themselves to fighting evil. They’re
not <em>all</em> members of divine classes, but those are quite common given their
usual temperament. In the end, though, they’re folk like everyone else. It’s
quite possible for some deva to settle for a peaceful life instead, or to go
down less-righteous paths.</p>

<p>When a deva dies, be it from natural or violent causes, they disappear and
immediately reincarnate at a random place in the world, clean slates once more,
ready to begin life anew.</p>

<p>A deva who turns to evil will reincarnate as a rakshasa on their next
life. Rakshasa have perfect recall when they reincarnate, so this might seem
like a good deal to a deva who has grown too attached to its present
identity. However, even they revile this fate, so they would rather avoid death
altogether than to undergo the transformation.</p>

<p>Given their perfect recall, it’s possible every rakshasa remembers being a
deva. I’d say that should a rakshasa redeem itself and become good (or at least
non-evil) once more, it will return to being a deva in its next life.</p>

<p>Deva fashion for all genders tends towards flowing robes, sometimes with
revealing chest “windows”. Their armor tends to be designed to go over those
robes. Armored or not, their outfits usually include back or shoulder
decorations resembling wings.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Deva are Medium Immortal Humanoids, have tier-dependent resistance to both
radiant and necrotic damage, and a +1 to all defenses against bloodied
creatures. Their signature ability is <strong>Memory of a Thousand Lifetimes</strong>, a
free-action encounter power that allows them to add +1d6 to an attack roll,
skill test or ability test they just made. This represents memories and flashes
of insight from the deva’s previous lives, and could end up turning a failure
into a success.</p>

<p>PC Devas have the same abilities, though their resistances are a bit more
granular and they also have the customary attribute and skill bonuses.</p>

<h3 id="deva-knight-errant">Deva Knight-Errant</h3>

<p>This deva travels the world acting as a champion of holy causes. It’s the first
monster I find in this book who is explicitly Good in alignment, and described
as most likely to serve the role of an ally to the PCs. Still, a party entirely
composed of shady fucks might find themselves at the wrong end of the
knight-errant.</p>

<p>The knight is a Level 11 Soldier with 111 HP and all standard Deva traits. Their
resistances are set to 10. Being paladin-types, they wear full plate and wield a
sword, a shield, and a holy symbol. Their speed is 5 due to the heavy armor.</p>

<p>Knights fight with a mixture swordplay and divine magic. The <strong>Inner Radiance</strong>
trait allows them to switch the damage type of any of their attacks to Radiant,
and to accept a -2 attack penalty to make the attack deal an extra 4 radiant
damage.</p>

<p>The knight’s <strong>broadsword</strong> marks for a turn on a hit, and they can perform a
<strong>Rejuvenating Strike</strong> with it that heals the knight for half the damage
dealt. It recharges whenever the knight hits with a normal sword attack. This
will become substantially more powerful once you fix their damage.</p>

<p>There’s a couple of pure-magic abilities as well: <strong>Martyr’s Cry</strong> (close burst
3 vs. Will; recharge 6) deals psychic damage and marks all targets hit (save
ends). <strong>Health Transfer</strong> (minor action; encounter) transfers up to 25 damage
<em>and</em> a condition from an ally within 10 squares to the knight.</p>

<p>Knight-Errants are well set-up to be allied NPCs, with those support and marking
abilities. The self-healing strike is important to give them some longer-term
staying power when riding with the party, as most healing abilities that depend
on healing surges are less effective on them.</p>

<h3 id="deva-zealot">Deva Zealot</h3>

<p>The zealot opposes evil, well, zealously. They’re a lot less nice in their
judgment and methods than the knight, and thus Unaligned. They wear leather or
other light armor, and wield falchions. Their resistances are set to 10. Their
speed is 6. If they were PCs, they’d be Avengers.</p>

<p>The <strong>falchion</strong> his a high-crit weapon and deals some bonus radiant
damage. It’s their main attack, and all their other abilities support
it. <strong>Skirmish</strong> works as usual, adding more bonus damage when they move at
least 4 squares in that turn. <strong>Dazzling Soul</strong> (minor; recharge 4-6) makes the
zealot shine so brightly it gains concealment and emits bright light in a
6-square radius and dim light out to 12 squares. <strong>Path of Virtue</strong> (encounter)
allows them to shift their speed and make one falchion attack against each enemy
in reach during the move.</p>

<p>Last but not least, <strong>Radiant Retribution</strong> is a <em>at-will free action</em> that
triggers when the zealot takes damage from an attack, and deals half that amount
as radiant damage to the attacker. I think this means it will trigger against
every attack made on the deva - if it was a reaction or interrupt, it would only
happen once per round.</p>

<h3 id="deva-fallen-star">Deva Fallen Star</h3>

<p>A deva who went bad and is all set to become a rakshasa on their next
incarnation, though ideally they don’t want to die at all. They’re Level 26
Artillery with 188 HP. Their resistances are set to 15. Using a rod as an
implement, if they were PCs they’d likely be a warlock.</p>

<p>The fallen star will likely open the fight with a <strong>Soul Scourge</strong> spell (area
burst 2 within 15 vs. Will), a fireball-sized blast that deals immediate radiant
damage and ongoing 15 necrotic damage (save ends). This recharges when it’s
first bloodied. Until then it will use a <strong>Forgetting Ray</strong> (ranged 20
vs. Reflex) which does psychic damage and restricts the target to using only
at-will attacks (save ends).</p>

<p>When hit by an attack, the fallen star can use <strong>Fateful Transposition</strong> (ranged
10 vs. Will) as an interrupt, targeting an enemy. A hit allows it to switch
places with that enemy, making it take half the triggering attack’s damage. The
deva still takes the other half.</p>

<p>The fallen start’s basic melee attack is the <strong>Rebuking Rod</strong>, which does
psychic and radiant damage and triggers a secondary attack vs. Fortitude: if
that one hits, the fallen star gains total concealment against the target (save
ends).</p>

<p>The fallen star’s research into evil magic has allowed it to trade the usual
Memory of a Thousand Lifetimes power for <strong>Fate Manipulation</strong>. This can add 1d8
to their rolls <em>or</em> remove 1d8 from an enemy’s roll, and it recharges once the
fallen star is first bloodied.</p>

<p>And finally, we have the ability that confirms this deva “fell” because it
wanted out of the circle of reincarnation: <strong>Vile Rebirth</strong>. When the deva is
reduced to 0 HP by non-necrotic damage, it doesn’t die. Instead, it remains at 0
HP until its next turn, when regains 25 HP and acquires the undead keyword. In
other words, it becomes something close to a newly-minted lich! This power
recharges, but the “non-necrotic” bit becomes “non-radiant”. In other words, you
have to either kill it with necrotic damage the first time around, or with
radiant damage after it becomes undead. If you don’t, it keeps coming back.</p>

<p>I’d say that if Vile Rebirth triggers and the falen star escapes, you can use it
as a lich in subsequent encounters. And if it dies “for real”, it’s rakshasa
time, though in that case it would take longer to return to the campaign if it
makes an appearance at all.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The book admits most PC parties are unlikely to find themselves facing a
knight-errant or even a zealot, so the sample encounter is Level 27 and features
a pair of fallen stars along with 2 efreet karadjins and 2 efreet
pyresingers. So it looks like the deva have joined the ranks of nobility at the
City of Brass.</p>

<p>I really like Deva! Aasimar from previous editions just had a celestial
somewhere in the family tree, Deva have a cool backstory on par with the one
that was given to tieflings. One thing I find particularly cool about the stat
blocks from this entry is that they could represent the trajectory (and tragic
fall) of a single individual over three lifetimes.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>This is the last post covering the “Demons” entry in the Monster Manual 2, and
it features a lone demon: the Yochlol, who has been in the game since at least
AD&amp;D 1st Edition.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Yochlols are the handmaidens of Lolth, being some of her most favored
servants. This a fact which those not initiated in Her mysteries will find
baffling because yochlols don’t resemble spiders in any way. In their natural
form these demons look like pillars of snot with a baleful red eye embedded near
the top. They can also take the shape of beautiful drow women.</p>

<p>Yochlols might be assigned by their mistress to assist mortal priests that have
also earned her favor, but they mainly works as spies. They’re so good at
passing for mortal drow that they can remain undetected for years at a time and
attain positions of great power in their society. I’ll write more about the
implications of this in the Impressions section.</p>

<p>The existence of yochlols is one more point in favor of my pet theory that Lolth
is actually a demon lord.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get a single stat block here, named Yochlol Tempter, which I guess is
representative of most of them.</p>

<p>Yochlols are Medium Elemental Humanoids with the Demon and Shapechanger
keywords. They’re Level 17 Controllers with 158 HP. Despite being demons, they
lack Variable Resistance and have Resist 10 Poison instead. They have
darkvision, a ground speed of 6, and a climb speed of 8 with Spider Climb.</p>

<p>Yochlols have two sets of attack powers, one for when they’re in demon form, the
other for when they’re in drow form. They can <strong>switch forms</strong> with a minor
action, but I guess an infiltrated yochlol will stick to drow form to avoid
blowing its cover. Once that happens, though, it will change shape as often as
it needs to assemble the best combos it can.</p>

<p>In demon form, the Tempter fights with its Reach 2 <strong>Tentacles</strong>. A basic
tentacle attack is quite weak, but the demon can make four of them with its
<strong>Amorphous Flurry</strong>. If two or more flurry attacks hit the same target, that
target takes a -4 penalty to Will (save ends).</p>

<p>At range, it can project a <strong>Maddening Web</strong> (area burst 2 within 10
vs. Reflex). It does no immediate damage, but immobilizes and deals 5 ongoing
damage (save ends). It recharges on a 4-6, but only while the yochlol is
bloodied. So it’s less of a web and more of flung ball of runny snot.</p>

<p>In drow form, this demon’s attacks are all what you would expect out of a
priestess of Lolth: a <strong>spider touch</strong> in melee that also deals ongoing 10
poison damage (save ends); a <strong>venom bolt</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Reflex) that deals
physical and ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends); and a minor-action <strong>Seductive
Glare</strong> which despite the horrible name is a slow-acting mind control spell
(ranged 10 vs. Will). On a hit the target is dazed (save ends); the first failed
save worsens that to Stunned, and the second to Dominated. In all cases a
successful save ends the effect.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is level 16 and as you would expect involves a lot of drow:
2 arachnomancers, 1 blademaster and a priest, accompanied by 2 yochlol
tempters. Your call as to whether the drow know about the demons or not.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Mechanically, I find yochlols quite interesting with their two forms that have
complimentary powers. A lone yochlol can set up some interesting combos by
itself, by using Amorphous Flurry to weaken someone’s Will and then the mind
control attack in the next round. If you have two of them, they can do that a
lot faster.</p>

<p>I remember seeing complains in Let’s Reads for older editions about how these
demons don’t seem to have much to do with Lolth thematically speaking. After
all, spiders are officially Her Thing and yochlols are not spiders. And despite
them being described as the ultimate shape-shifting spies, they can only turn
into drow, so they can’t be used to spy on the drow’s enemies.</p>

<p>The bits of lore here help make sense of all that. Lolth is also the goddess of
lies, and treachery is among her commandments. How much do you think such a
deity would trust their followers? No, Yochlols aren’t made to spy on the
enemies of the drow. They’re made to spy <em>on the drow</em>. Their un-spider-like
nature gives Lolth some plausible deniability. It is, perhaps, a hint that these
demons are the product of another side of Lolth’s personality, one rarely known
to her worshippers. Because despite all the dedication the drow people lavishes
on her, Lolth doesn’t trust them.</p>

<p>That’s kinda tragic, for both the Drow and for Lolth.</p>

<p>We continue looking at the many monsters in the Demons entry of the Monster
Manual 2.</p>

<h2 id="nycademon">Nycademon</h2>

<p>I’m pretty sure these winged, four-armed creatures used to be classified as
Yugoloths in previous editions, where their name was written as
“Nycadaemon”. Yugoloths, or daemons, were the Neutral Evil Fiends, created
because the writers of AD&amp;D decided every alignment needed its own
representative outsider. Fourth Edition uses a different cosmology and a
different alignment system, so its authors elected to turn daemons into demons.</p>

<p>Nycademons spend their days flying over the open expanses of the Abyss in search
of creatures to snatch and drop from a great height, which they think is hella
funny. This has given them the nickname of “sky demons”. They place great value
in physical strength, and so have a tendency to underestimate beings whose power
is less obvious (“Do you even lift, bro?”). They’re also hesitant to attack
someone who seems big and strong, for the same reason.</p>

<p>Like many former daemons, nycademons have a mercenary temperament and will work
for anyone who pays them. These contracts tend to be short-lived though, as
their superiority complex tends to infuriate most allies. All that flexing can
get annoying really fast.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Nycademons are Large Elemental Humanoids (demons) and Level 22 Skirmishers with
210 HP. They have Variable Resistance 20 (2/encounter), as well as ground and
fly speeds of 6. The one in this book fights with a pair of greataxes it wields
one-handed, leaving it with two free hands to snatch victims.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Wicked Axe</strong> attacks are Reach 2 and High-Crit, and also cause ongoing 5
damage (save ends). <strong>Wicked Edges</strong> allows it to make two such attacks in one
action, putting its damage near where it should be even without the math fix.</p>

<p>Instead of axing someone, the nycademon can <strong>Snatch</strong> them (Reach 2
vs. Fortitude). It can fly 6 squares before or after making the attack, which
does no damage but grabs the target. The <strong>Strong Flyer</strong> trait exempts it from
the usual obstacles to moving a grabbed target, so it can travel its full speed
with the grabbed victim without needing to make additional tests to do so.</p>

<p>All of these traits lend themselves well to the “snatch and drop” tactics
described in the lore. Grab someone, fly up for a few rounds while attacking
them with the axes, drop them for a bunch of d10s of fall damage.</p>

<p>The sample encounter has three nycademons, a goristro and a rot harbinger. It’s
Level 21, and likely affiliated with Orcus.</p>

<h3 id="impressions">Impressions</h3>

<p>While mechanically simple, I kinda like the whole “snatch and drop” thing. It’s
also fun to imagine these creatures as condescending gym bros.</p>

<h2 id="pod-demons">Pod Demons</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-demon-pod.png"/>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Particularly disgusting examples of demonkind, these slimy creatures can spawn
miniatures of themselves from their blistered bodies, using them to corner and
terrorize their victims.</p>

<p>The spawn have no mind of their own, being extensions of the demon’s main
body. In fact, the pod demon can transfer its conscience to a podling, causing
it to grow to full size while the original body shrinks.</p>

<p>These creatures have some connection to the mysterious Chained God (AKA
Tharizdun, but no one in-setting rememebers that name). Some of them wrap
themselves in chains to show their allegiance.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Pod Demons are Large Elemental Humanoids (demons), and Level 15 Elite Artillery
with 176 HP. They have darkvision and Variable Resistance 15
(2/encounter). Their ground speed is 8.</p>

<p>They fight by using their half-formed spawn as ammo. They can either throw a
spawn so it explodes on impact using <strong>Fling Podspawn</strong> (area burst 1 within 10
vs. Reflex), or squeeze it to spray nearby enemies with <strong>Spew Podspawn</strong> (close
blast 3 vs. Reflex). In either case, targets take acid damage on a hit.</p>

<p>Fully formed podspawn constantly pop free of the parent body: one appears within
2 squares of the original at the start of its turn as long as there are fewer
than 4 podspawn in play. The parent can also force them out with <strong>Generate
Podspawn</strong> (close burst 2 vs. Reflex), which does poison damage and fills
unoccupied squares with enough podspawn to reach the limit of 4.</p>

<p>As a move action the pod demon can <strong>Transfer Essence</strong>, effectively swapping
positions with a podspawn within 10 squares. As a minor action it can use
<strong>Detonate Minion</strong> (ranged 10), causing a podspawn in range to explode and deal
a bit of automatic poison damage to adjacent creatures.</p>

<p>If forced into melee, they attack with a weak <strong>Claw</strong> that also does ongoing
poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>I’m guessing that if you have multiple pod demons in play, each of them will be
able to have its own set of four minions.</p>

<p>The podspawn themselves also have a little stat block. They’re Level 15 Minion
Skirmishers whose resistances always match the parent’s, and who attack with a
<strong>corroding slime</strong> that’s slightly stronger than the parent’s claw. Their
<strong>dangerous proximity</strong> trait gives them combat advantage against any adjacent
enemy, no flanking required.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 16: 1 immolith, 1 pod demon, 4 podspawn and 2 red
slaads.</p>

<h2 id="runespiral-demon">Runespiral Demon</h2>

<p>These turtle-beetle things have complex patterns of arcane runes etched into
their shells, which channel arcane energies from deeper within the Abyss. The
specimens depicted here turn this energy into lightning, but there are others
with variant runic patterns that use other elements.</p>

<p>Runespiral demons are sapient, but they don’t have hands and are nowhere near
smart enough to be good at arcane magic. The runes are either natural or etched
by some unseen patron. In combat, they rely on the magic of these runes to
attack at range.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-2">The Numbers</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-demon-runespiral.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We actually get two varieties here: common Runespiral Demons are Small Elemental
Magical Beasts, and Level 5 Artillery with 51 HP. Arctide Runespiral Demons are
Large, and Level 12 Artillery with 97 HP. They have Variable Resistances of 10
and 15 respectively, and a ground speed of 7. Their attacks are almost
identical.</p>

<p>They can attack distant opponents with either a <strong>Focused Strike</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Reflex) that does standard lightning damage, or a <strong>Lightning Burst</strong> (Area
Burst 2 Within 10 vs. Reflex), which does bit less lightning damage as a
baseline, but has that damage increase by 1 for each creature caught in the
blast. That’s <em>creature</em>, not <em>enemy</em>: allies caught in the blast will increase
its damage, but will also be damaged by it since it’s not a selective burst. The
Arctide Demon’s burst is also <strong>Charged</strong>: it does all of the above and
additionally gives allies damaged by it a +1 bonus to their next recharge rolls.</p>

<p>When an enemy moves adjacent to one of these demons they release an <strong>Arcane
Arc</strong> (melee 1 vs. Reflex) as an interrupt, dealing lightning damage. In melee
they’ll <strong>bite</strong> for very little physical damage, and when bloodied they release
a <strong>Bloodied Shock</strong> (close burst 1 vs. Reflex) that deals lightning damage and
dazes.</p>

<p>The sample encounter has 2 basic runespiral remons, 2 evistros, and the human
hexer who summoned them all.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-1">Impressions</h3>

<p>More demon artillery support. They have some mechanical weaknesses: all of their
good attacks deal the same type of damage and target the same defense. Some GMs
might want to pull a Gygax and say that runespiral demons with other elements
look identical save for their different runes and that it takes an Arcana test
to distinguish them.</p>

<h2 id="rupture-demon">Rupture Demon</h2>

<p>These demonic amoeboids are the least spawn of Juiblex, and they act as abyssal
scavengers, following more powerful demons around and eating the remains of
their kills. When they die their own remains can infest those more powerful
demons and make them even stronger. Does that serve some plan of Juiblex? No one
knows.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-3">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Rupture Demons are Level 5 Minion Soldiers, with low-light vision, a ground
speed of 6 and a climb speed of 3 with Spider Climb. They lack any elemental
resistance.</p>

<p>They can attack directly with a <strong>Slimy Extrusion</strong> for minor physical damage,
or they can use an <strong>Enveloping Embrace</strong>. This hits automatically, does no
damage and restrains the target (save ends). It also kills the demon, presumably
because it has to rupture to envelop someone.</p>

<p>When a rupture demon dies, either due to an attack or from using the Embrace, it
explodes into a mass of ichor and pseudopods that latches onto another demon
within 5 squares. This infestation heals 5 HP and gives it a +2 damage
bonus. Multiple infestations stack, up to a maximum of +10 damage. For this to
work the infested demon must be level 10 or less.</p>

<p>The sample encounter has 1 Black Pudding, 1 Evistro, and 6 rupture demons. An
interesting contrast, because the pudding is going to split into smaller enemies
and the rupture demons will join with the Evistro as the fight goes on.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-2">Impressions</h3>

<p>I like their concept! The level limitation is a bit strange. Presumably you
could have higher level minions that could affect more powerful demons. In that
case you should make sure they’re still a few levels behind the “real”
opposition, since you want them to die fast and provide that damage bonus.</p>

<h2 id="end-of-part-3">End of Part 3</h2>

<p>There’s one more to go, with the last remaining demon.</p>

<p>Continuing with the “Demon” entry of the Monster Manual 2, let’s look at a few
more abyssal greeblies.</p>

<h2 id="gnaw-demon">Gnaw Demon</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-demon-gnaw.png"/>

</figure>

<p>These round boys live to eat. Their hunger is insatiable and they’re always
gnawing on and eating everything around them. That sentence is quite literal
too: they can eat <em>anything</em>, so they eat <em>everything</em>, all the time. Being
demons, of course, they prefer living flesh above all else.</p>

<p>Despite this, gnaw demons are also quite cowardly and will run away if they see
they’ve bitten off more than they can chew. Tracking them down isn’t too
difficult, though, since they’ll soon become distracted by some other
weak-looking target.</p>

<p>Gnaw demons can teleport, but it’s apparently a reflex not under their conscious
control. Though they’ll likely avoid the thick of the fight at first, the smell
of blood drives them into a frenzy.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Gnaw Demons are Small Elemental Humanoids, and Level 5 Skirmishers with 66
HP. They have Darkvision and are slow and blobby with a ground speed of 3 and a
flight speed of 5 (clumsy). They have Variable Resistance 10 (1/encounter).</p>

<p>In combat they’re all about biting, since they’re pretty much trying to eat
you. Their <strong>Ankle Biter</strong> aura (1) inflicts a -2 penalty to the speed of any
enemy caught inside. Their basic attack is the obvious <strong>bite</strong>, which deals
extra damage to bloodied enemies.</p>

<p>That reflexive teleport is modeled with two different abilities: <strong>Hungry
Teleport</strong> (move action) allows the demon to teleport 10 squares into a square
adjacent to a bloodied enemy. <strong>Pain-Induced Teleport</strong> (free action when first
bloodied) is an unrestricted 10-square teleport, which it will likely use to
flee.</p>

<h3 id="impressions">Impressions</h3>

<p>I kinda like these critters. They’re more flavorful than evistros (which
smoulder with generic rage), though they also pair really well with them or
other front-liners that can get the enemy bloodied so they can teleport in.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 6 and has three of these spherical terrors
accompanying a pair of gnolls.</p>

<h2 id="kazrith">Kazrith</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-demon-kazrith.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Kazriths are barracuda-like aquatic demons that prowl the watery bodies of the
abyss and might be summoned to do so elsewhere. Despite their preference for
water they’re also perfectly capable of operating on land, so you don’t have to
build an underwater dungeon in order to use them.</p>

<p>Though sapient, kazriths prefer to act as ambush predators, burying themselves
in the ground and jumping out to attack anything that looks like it would be fun
to kill. Their pores secrete strong acid, which helps both with the burrowing
and with the killing.</p>

<p>They burrow as fast as they can run and leave stable tunnels behind, which means
all bodies of water in kazrith territory are linked by networks of flooded
tunnels. So if you <em>do</em> want to make an underwater dungeon, you have the perfect
excuse.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Kazriths are Medium Elemental Magical Beasts with the Demon and Water
keywords. Note that they <em>don’t</em> have Aquatic, so they don’t gain that +2 attack
bonus when fighting underwater. They’re Level 20 Lurkers with 146 HP, an
immunity to acid, and Variable Resistance 20 (2/encounter). They have a ground
speed of 6, a burrow speed of 6 with Tunneling, and a swim speed of 8.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> that also deals 5 ongoing acid damage (save
ends). They can also burrow back into the ground while spraying acid behind
them: this <strong>Acidic Retreat</strong> (recharge 5-6) is a close burst 2 vs. Refles,
deals light physical damage, and 10 ongoing acid damage (save ends). It also
allow the demon to burrow its speed as an effect.</p>

<p>When bloodied, its <strong>Acidic Seepage</strong> increases, causing it to gain +4 burrow
speed and deal 10 acid damage to enemies that start their turn adjacent to the
kazrith. Its <strong>Slippery</strong> trait allows it to make extra saves against the
immobilized, slowed and restrained conditions at the start of its turn.</p>

<p>Fighting a kazrith is like playing a corrosive game of whack-a-mole, as it will
keep burrowing back and popping up to bite you, and it’s hard to pin down.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounters-and-impressions">Sample Encounters and Impressions</h3>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 18 and features an Evil Party of aboleths, their
minion servitors, and a pair of kazriths.</p>

<p>Kazriths sound like something that should logically exist, but by themselves
they don’t really stoke my imagination. They do make decent additions to
adventures featuring varied demons as opposition, and they work well with
Aboleths.</p>

<h2 id="needle-demon">Needle Demon</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-demon-needle.png"/>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>These prickly assholes love seeing former friends and allies turn on each other
with murderous intent, particularly when they were the ones who instigated
it. They’re much smarter than they look and often end up as advisors to more
powerful villains, sometimes even as the power behind the throne. However, their
lust for infighting often gets the better of them, so these deceptions never
last long and cause terrible damage when they collapse.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-2">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Needle demons are Medium Elemental Humanoids (demons), and Level 12 Controllers
with 123 HP. They have darkvision and Variable Resistance 15 (2/encounter). They
run with speed 6.</p>

<p>They fight with their pincers and spiked tail. The <strong>claw</strong> attack is pretty
standard, and <strong>Claws of Betrayal</strong> allows them to attack twice with them. If
both attacks hit the same target, that target takes 10 ongoing damage (save
ends). The <strong>Tail</strong> is a reaction attack that does light physical damage and is
triggered by an enemy moving to a square adjacent to the demon.</p>

<p>Their most thematic power is <strong>Rage of the Betrayed</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Will;
enemies only; recharge 6), which does no damage but dominates (save ends). Yes,
it’s a mass dominate. It works by convincing the affected target that their
allies have betrayed them, so I guess the demon is going to use it to make the
PCs focus on fighting each other instead of itself.</p>

<p>The sample encounters have them working alongside gnolls and drow, but repeat
that it never takes long for them to turn on their own allies.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-1">Impressions</h3>

<p>Simple, but quite effective due to that mass dominate. I’m guessing you could
use a recurring needle demon NPC as a source of lots of drama, having it appear
somewhere in every villainous group the PCs oppose only to always run away.</p>

<h2 id="neldrazu">Neldrazu</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-demon-neldrazu.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These demons are into kidnapping, for which they use their four hooked
claws. During a battle they like to hide around the edges and jump out to snatch
an enemy and drag it either to an isolated spot or into the midst of the
neldrazu’s allies. They’re often summoned by slavers who don’t mind if the goods
are slightly damaged.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-3">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Neldrazu are Large Elemental Humanoids (demons) and Level 8 Lurkers with 71
HP. They have darkvision and Variable Resistance 10 (1/encounter). They have a
ground speed of 8 and a climb speed of 6 with Spider Climb.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a standard <strong>Claw</strong>, but when only one enemy is within 5
squares of the neldrazu they can really stretch and use <strong>Flaying Claws</strong>, which
do double damage plus ongoing 5 damage (save ends). This means they’ll lurk
until they can catch a PC alone, and then move in with this attack.</p>

<p>After using Flaying Claws, a neldrazu will likely follow it up with <strong>Abduct</strong>
(recharge 5-6), a move action attack that targets Reflex and can only be used
against enemies. It does no damage, but teleports the target 10 squares to a
place of the demon’s choice on a hit. The demon teleports 10 squares right after
this, either adjacent to the target on a hit, or to anywhere it chooses on a
miss.</p>

<p>I think the best way to use this is to drop an enemy right in the middle of the
neldrazu’s allies. If a lurker isolates itself with a PC, things tend to go
poorly for the lurker.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-2">Impressions</h3>

<p>The Monster Manual 3 and later on the Monster Vault would include the Babau, a
level 13 Skirmisher demon that’s quite similar, and which we covered
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/11/07/babau.html">here</a>. At the time I remember poo-pooing the babau’s abduction tactics
because I assumed it would always take the victim to an isolated place, but now
I see it can also take them to its allies instead.</p>

<p>Compared to the babau, the neldrazu is a better team player, since it can abduct
more often in a fight. Its special attack is quite situational, but it can be
used <em>before</em> the abduction, which means it doesn’t have to choose between
isolating a victim and bringing it to its allies.</p>

<h2 id="end-of-part-2">End of Part 2</h2>

<p>There’s at least one more post’s worth of demons to cover.</p>
