<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Thri-kreen are the famous mantis-people of Athas. A slightly more generic
version of them appeared in the Monster Manual 3, and now we get more NPC stat
blocks here and a playable version in the Campaign Guide. Unlike what happened
to muls a few pages back, thri-kreen in the Creature Catalog are given a
description that’s about as positive as the one for the playable version.</p>

<p>Thri-kreen have deep instinctual bonds of loyalty to their “clutch” and their
“pack”. As the Campaign Guide explains, a clutch is a small group of at most six
individuals to whom the thri-kreen feels closest, and a pack is an extended
family composed of multiple clutches.</p>

<p>Traditionally a clutch is formed by individuals who hatched from their eggs at
around the same time, but kreen can “adopt” other clutches over time if
circumstances demand. For PCs, this means their adventuring party is their
clutch. NPC kreen away from their homes will have similar arrangements with
their ally groups.</p>

<p>Those ubiquitous asshole slavers like to steal Thri-kreen eggs so that their can
exploit their bonding instinct, making them extremely loyal to their new
masters.</p>

<p>Thri-kreen packs prefer to hunt non-sapient creatures for food, but they will
make exceptions in truly desperate times. They will fight with all their
strenght to protect themselves from attacks by other people, but will almost
never be the aggressors in such fights. Their spiritual leaders are known as
desert talkers, and are responsible for maintaining their connection to the
primal spirits of the desert and those of their ancestors. This gives them a
very long genetic memory, stretching back to an ancient age where they had their
own great empire.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>These NPC thri-kreen are Medium Natural Humanoids with Low-Light Vision. The
ones here have ground speeds between 6 and 7, slightly slower than the MM3
ones. Their signature ability remains <strong>Mantis Jump</strong>, an move-action encounter
power that lets them jump their speed without provoking opportunity
attacks. This is indeed different from the power PCs get.</p>

<p>We get three new stat blocks here, which can be mixed in with the ones from the
MM3 without any extra work.</p>

<h3 id="thri-kreen-bounder">Thri-Kreen Bounder</h3>

<p>These are less experienced hunters who are still learning the tricks of the
trade by observing the pack’s veterans at work. They tend to be a little more
skittish than those veterans. They’re Level 6 Minion Skirmishers with a ground
speed of 6.</p>

<p>The <strong>Deft Dodger</strong> trait gives them +2 to defenses against ranged attacks,
which helps them survive longer in a fight. They attack in melee with <strong>claws</strong>
and at range with thrown <strong>Chatkchas</strong>, which are three-pointed throwing blades
with Range 6/12.</p>

<p>Instead of Mantis Jump they have <strong>Mantis Bound</strong>, which lets them jump 3
squares without provoking opportunity attacks as a reaction to being missed by
an attack.</p>

<h3 id="thri-kreen-mauler">Thri-Kreen Mauler</h3>

<p>These are the veteran hunters, big and beefy thri-kreen who single out a quarry,
jump on top of it, and tear it apart. They’re Level 8 Brutes with 105 HP and a
speed of 6.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>Claw</strong> attack is way too weak for a level 8 brute (average damage
9), but <strong>Mauler Frenzy</strong> (recharge 4+) lets them make two of those, three when
bloodied. <strong>Mauler Leap</strong> lets them jump 6 squares and make two claw attacks
with a +1 to attack and a +4 to damage, which definitely matches the
formula. This recharges when they’re first bloodied.</p>

<p>If the mauler hits a bloodied target with their claws, they can use <strong>Pain
Amplification</strong> against that rarget with a minor action, attacking their
Fortitude. A hit causes the target to take ongoing 5 psychic damage (save ends).</p>

<p>If multiple claw attacks aren’t on the cards this turn, the mauler can use its
<strong>Chatkchas</strong> at range, which do level-appropriate physical damage. Mantis Jump
rounds out their arsenal.</p>

<p>While Maulers will try to avoid getting killed like any opponent, they don’t
mind getting bloodied since it makes them stronger. They probably should try to
open the fight with a Leap, get stuck in for a Frenzy or two, and then jump away
for that second use of Mauler Leap once bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="thri-kreen-mantis-warrior">Thri-Kreen Mantis Warrior</h3>

<p>Mantis Warriors are hunt leaders, highly skilled with both weapons and psychic
powers. They’re Level 10 Elite Soldiers with 208 HP and a ground speed of 7.</p>

<p>They still have their <strong>Claws</strong>, and also carry a <strong>Gythka</strong>, a light polearm
with a trident-like head on either end. Both do equivalent damage, but the
gythka marks for a turn on a hit and does a blend of physical and psychic damage
instead of just physical. They can also throw <strong>Chatkchas</strong>, though these are a
bit weaker.</p>

<p>The <strong>Mantis Flurry</strong> ability allows the warrior to make a claw and a gythka
attack, or to throw two chatkchas, with a single action.</p>

<p>Occasionally they can pull off a <strong>Springing Assault</strong> (recharge 5+): this lets
them jump 4 squares, make a gythka attack, then jump another 3 and make another
gythka attack. None of this movement provokes opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can perform a <strong>Mind Wrench</strong>, attacking the Will of all
enemies in a Close Burst 2. On a hit this deals psychic damage and marks for a
turn.</p>

<p>When an adjacent marked enemy moves, shifts, or makes an attack that doesn’t
target the warrior, it can cause a <strong>Spasm</strong> as an interrupt. This is an attack
against Will that does psychic damage on a hit, knocks the target prone, and
slows them until the end of the warrior’s next turn.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These three stat blocks combined with the Ambusher, Scout, and Sand Talker from
the MM3 will let you build a large variety of thri-kreen encounters. They can
also be part of “found clutches”, AKA Mixed Groups of Humanoids, voluntarily or
not.</p>

<p>I note that the MM3 Thri-Kreen are described as using “spears” and “shuriken”,
which clearly correspond to the gythkas and chatkchas used by these ones. A
simple find-and-replace of the names should work, as there is no mechanical
difference between them in the stat blocks themselves.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was a town named Gerot at the foot of a mountain near the
city-state of Raam. Its people were great warriors, but also haugthy. When the
Sorcerer Queen Abalach-Re sent them an offer of alliance in exchange for them
joining Raam’s legions, they signaled their refusal by killing the envoys.</p>

<p>Abalach-Re was obviously very angry at this, so she double-cursed the people of
Gerot: they would be afflicted with an unquenchable thirst <em>and</em> pure water
would become like a poison to them. In short order, the entire town was
dead. The bit the queen hadn’t predicted was that the dead of Gerot would rise
again, as the first thraxes.</p>

<p>A thrax is a water vampire. Still afflicted by the sorcerous curse, it suffers
from constant, unquenchable thirst, which it tries to satisfy by draining the
fluids from the flesh of the living. Thrax victims become desiccated husks, and
it’s said to be an agonizing death.</p>

<p>Unlike a standard D&amp;D vampire, a thrax seems to retain the mind and personality
it had in life. This means they’re even more miserable, tormented not just by
their cursed thirst but also by their regret at having to feed. Prime personal
horror material there.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, we’re talking about the thraxes that seek revenge on
Abalach-Re by haunting Raam and drinking her supporters dry. I imagine those are
a fair bit less conflicted than the others.</p>

<p>Thraxes can drain fluids through skin contact, and they also have this trick
where they can cause a victim’s fluids to all move close to the skin, making the
victim bloated and easier to drain.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We only get a single stat block here, so let’s get right to it.</p>

<h3 id="thrax">Thrax</h3>

<p>The thrax shown here is Medium Natural Humanoid (undead) and a Level 11 Lurker
with 88 HP, putting it about on par with the traditional vampires from the
Monster Vault. It has darkvision, Resist 10 Necrotic, and Vulnerable 5
Radiant. Unlike a lot of other undead, it has no special resistance against
poison and disease. And unlike a traditional vampire, it is not vulnerable to
natural sunlight.</p>

<p>Thraxes are surrounded by <strong>Roiling Shadows</strong> which give them +2 to defenses
against ranged attacks, and their <strong>Clinging Grasp</strong> makes them insubstantial
and immune to forced movement while they have a creature grabbed. This takes
away the PC’s easiest tactic for making them let go.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is the <strong>Grasp of the Dead</strong>, which deals necrotic damage. If
the thrax has combat advantage, a hit also grabs the victim, which has a -5
penalty to escape rolls.</p>

<p>Once it has a creature grabbed, the thrax can proceed to <strong>Drain Fluids</strong>, which
deals heavy necrotic damage, heals the thrax for 10 HP, and ends the grab. If the
attack bloodies the target, they also fall unconscious (save ends).</p>

<p>The thrax can also attack with <strong>Flesh Bloat</strong>, the “trick” mentioned
above. This is an at-will melee attack that deals a bit more necrotic damage
than the Grasp, and also dazes and slows the target (save ends both).</p>

<p>Standard tactics for a thrax will likely be to bloat their intended victim, grab
them with Grasp of the Dead, and then Drain Fluids, repeating as necessary.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Water vampires feel much more appropriate for Dark Sun than the traditional
blood kind. I’m guessing all the traditional vampires in Athas must have melted
in the heat from all those layers they tend to wear.</p>

<p>Thraxes will probably only join up with other thraxes, and a fight against five
of them will be nightmarish for the party. You could also mix it up with other
relatively “dry” undead types. Maybe angry ghosts, or the animated corpses of
their dried-out victims.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>If our previous entry was kind of vague about whether tareks were a product of
the genocidal “Cleansing Wars” in Athas’ distant past, this one is pretty
categorical. Tembos are bioengineered terror weapons, created using magic most
foul for the purposes of facilitating genocide.</p>

<p>The “Champions” of that time (which unknown to most are the sorcerer-kings of
today) created them to sneak upon the homes of their opponents, and take from
them those they loved most. In addition to their stealthy forms and sharp fangs,
they received a limited ability to blend with shadows, the power to bite
someone in the soul, and a sophisticated intellect that is entirely devoted to
finding new ways of fulfilling their purpose in crueler ways.</p>

<p>They have survived as a species to this day, roaming mainly through the western
wastelands of the Tyr region, but they have been sighted elsewhere too. There’s
no one to give them specific targets any more, so they choose their victims
themselves, for food and fun.</p>

<p>Confirmation that a tembo is targetting a settlement is one of the only things
that will immediately end any infighting and other disagreements and make its
whole population unite against the threat. Everyone hates these things more than
they hate each other, which is saying something in Athas.</p>

<p>How exactly these attacks happen vary with the creature’s whims, as well as with
what it judges to be the most effective tactic for a given situation. Sometimes
they stay hidden and let their deadly magical aura slowly kill the population,
and sometimes they tear people apart in broad daylight.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Tembos are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts and Level 6 Solo Skirmishers with 280
HP. Their <strong>Killing Presence</strong> acts as an aura (2) that deals 5 necrotic damage
to anyone who starts their turn inside. When the tembo is bloodied, its <em>second</em>
aura kicks in. <strong>Tainted Wounds</strong> (aura 5) halves any HP recovery from healing
effects for those inside.</p>

<p>As a solo, the tembo has <strong>Double Actions</strong>, meaning it rolls initiative twice
and takes full turns in both counts. And finally, it’s <strong>Immovable</strong>, being
completely immune to any kind of forced movement, and getting a free save
against being knocked prone.</p>

<p>The monster’s main attack is a <strong>Bite</strong> that damages, inflicts a -2 attack
penalty for a turn, and serves as a carrier for the <strong>Unspeakable Violation</strong>
secondary attack. This targets Fortitude, and on a hit eats a healing surge and
doubles the damage from Killing Presence against that target for a
turn. Fortunately, it has Recharge 6+, so it doesn’t happen with every bite.</p>

<p>Its attack it’s likely to use the most is a <strong>Raking Assault</strong>, which deals the
same damage as the bite then lets the Tembo shift 4 squares and use the bite. So
that’s two or three attacks for the price of one, with the creature being able
to do this two times per round.</p>

<p>Its camouflage powers take two forms: <strong>Blending</strong> (encounter) is a move action
that makes the tembo invisible for a turn or until its next attack. And <strong>Shadow
Evasion</strong> (recharge when first bloodied) is a reaction that triggers when it’s
hit by a melee or ranged attack, letting it shift 4 squares and become
insubstantial for a turn.</p>

<p>Having two full turns per round can actually make Blending last even less, so
it’s not something a tembo will use to lie in wait for a long time. It will
instead rely on mundane stealth for this. Then it will charge in, use as many
Raking Assault flurries as it can, and combine Shadow Evasion with Blending to
escape from sight, only coming back to attack when its enemies’ guards are
down. Its ability to delete healing surges makes such long-term harassment
tactics even more effective, since it will obviously attack you in your sleep
and stop you from taking a long rest. Fighting the creature to the finish
in a single encounter will require preventing its escape somehow.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>What a horrible, horrible monster.</p>

<p>Tembos are almost always found alone. As mentioned above, everyone hates these
things. They will sometimes join together in small packs, but these end up
breaking apart pretty soon because they suck at organizing themselves.</p>

<p>We’re back to using the s-word for this one, though it only appears once.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>According to the book, legends tell that “an entity of mad destruction” created
the tareks in the very distant past to serve as “instruments of murder”. I guess
this means that they were created as bioweapons for the genocidal wars of the
Red Age, which would explain why they’re so strong and tough. In any case, their
earth priests helped them revolt against their masters and attain independence.</p>

<p>In our narrative present, tareks live in isolated communities in Athas’ hilly
and moutainous regions. They’re intensely isolationist and xenophobic, so most
of the contact they have with other humanoids is when they raid any of their
communities that might be located too near to tarek territory.</p>

<p>While they seemingly hate everyone, they are “sworn enemies of the gith”. Like
all particularly strong humanoid species, they’re popular targets for slavers
because they do well at the arena. It’s no wonder most revolts in Athas seem to
start there…</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Tareks are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 6. Their signature
trait is <strong>Deathless Warrior</strong>, which lets them roll a save when they hit 0
HP. If they pass, they only drop at the end of their next turn, and can act
normally until them. They speak Common and Giant, and are Unaligned by default.</p>

<p>The book recommends adding additional varieties of tarek by taking orc stat
blocks and replacing their bonus charge speed and Warrior’s Surge with Deathless
Warrior. So I guess they’re explicitly Darker and Sunnier orcs.</p>

<h3 id="tarek-raider">Tarek Raider</h3>

<p>Raiders are Level 3 Soldiers with 49 HP. They’re disciplined and try to stick
together in a fight even if scattered by forced movement. Their <strong>Tarek Squad
Tactics</strong> give them Combat Advantage against anyone adjacent to at least one
other Tarek.</p>

<p>A raider is usually armed with a <strong>Bone Heartpick</strong> whose attacks damage, slide
1 square, and mark for a turn on a hit. If someone decides to ignore the mark,
their <strong>Dangerous Aggression</strong> gives them a free attack against the offender,
and if that hits the target is also immobilized (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="tarek-earth-shaman">Tarek Earth Shaman</h3>

<p>Earth shamans are Level 4 Controllers with the Leader tag. They fight much like
Earthbenders from the Avatar shows.</p>

<p>Their melee attacks use <strong>Fists of Stone</strong> which target Fortitude, damage on a
hit and slide 3 squares as an effect. They can also use a spell named
<strong>Clutching Stone</strong> (close blast 3 vs. Fort, recharge 5+) that does the same
damage, knocks targets prone, and restrains them (save ends). And their ultimate
technique is <strong>Tide of Stone</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Ref, recharges when first
bloodied), which deals heavy damage and knocks prone on a hit. Allies caught in
the blast can instead shift 3 squares as an effect.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Tareks will only buddy up with other tareks and whatever domesticated beasts
they might train. You will only find them in Mixed Groups of People if they’re
enslaved.</p>

<p>As seen above, they like to stick close to each other in fights, and the book
also mentions they like the same focused fire tactics that tend to be described
as optimal for PCs. In other words, if they can they’ll pick a particularly
vulnerable target and focus their attacks there until the target is dead before
moving on to the next.</p>

<p>I believe this entry confirms that different monster entries in the Catalog are
written by different authors, because its description of Athasian lizardfolk is
as even-handed and respectful as the one for muls was racist, and they’re not
even playable by default!</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, ssurrans are Athasian lizardfolk. They’re as adapted to the
desert wastes as their relatives from other worlds are to swamps. Like all other
humanoids in Athas, their daily goal is survival.</p>

<p>Ssurrans (also known as “sandscale lizardfolk”) organize in nomadic tribes made
up of several family groups and a number of reptilian beasts that serve the
usual purposes from hauling cargo to helping in fights. They hunt, forage, and
sometimes raid while on the move.</p>

<p>Ssurran raids on settled communities are downright merciful when compared to
most others described so far. They allow the inhabitants to flee and only kill
those who try to fight back. Then they steal every usable good they can carry
and move away, taking care to erase their tracks and lay some false trails to
deter pursuers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Ssurrans are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Reptile and Lizardfolk tags. They
have a ground speed of 6 with Earth Walk, and speak Draconic. While this entry
only has two stat blocks, it does outright say that you can take any standard
lizardfolk from other books and replace Swamp Walk with Earth Walk to get a
sandscale version. You can also apply one of the monster themes found in the
back half of the book (and which we’ll see eventually).</p>

<h3 id="ssurran-shaman">Ssurran Shaman</h3>

<p>Sandscales have a long tradition of worshipping the sun and related primal
spirits. A shaman’s duties also include preserving their tribe’s oral history
and culture.</p>

<p>Your typical ssurran shaman is a Level 3 Controller with 47 HP. They fight with
a Spear that damages and pushes 1 square on a hit, and can cast at-will <strong>Sun
Curses</strong> (ranged 5 vs. Reflex) that deal fire damage and daze for a turn. Their
<strong>Treacherous Spirit</strong> spell (ranged 5 vs. Will, recharge on a miss) dominates
the target (save ends).</p>

<p>Despite their low-level, ssurran shamans are pretty dangerous and are likely to
be an unfortunate PC party’s first introduction to the Dazed and Dominated
conditions.</p>

<h3 id="ssurran-hunter">Ssurran Hunter</h3>

<p>These make up the bulk of any ssurran scout, hunting, or raiding party. They’re
Level 4 Minion Skirmishers that fight with <strong>picks</strong> that deal a little extra
damage to enemies granting Combat Advantage. If an enemy hits one of their
adjacent allies, the hunter can use <strong>Sidestep</strong> as a reaction to shift 1
square.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Ssurran tribes tend to stick together. Lone lizardfolk will either be outcasts,
or the last survivors of their tribes. Sometimes, slavers kidnap their young for
sale as “exotic merchandise”, so they might be found among enslaved guards or
gladiators.</p>

<p>I really like the way they were described in the book - my text here is barely
paraphrased. Simply by describing these lizardfolk as <em>people</em>, it already
allows me to imagine a bunch of situations where they’re potential oposition but
where things can still be solved by means other than murder. They also make
great potential allies in many other scenarios, because even when a group of
ssurrans is not nice there will likely be someone much worse nearby.</p>
