<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>The Gravelstokes are a new threat with very specific ties to the Nentir Vale
setting. They also serve as a reminder that Nerath wasn’t all sunshine and
roses.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Gravelstokes used to be one of the most prominent noble families in old
Nerath. They frequented the highest courts, had the ear of the royal family, and
had holdings spread through all corners of the empire. The time of strife and
backstabbing that followed the fall of Nerath’s government saw their fortunes
and household greatly diminished. Despite paying such a heavy cost to end the
family’s old rivalries, it managed to keep its deepest and darkest secret: all
of that prestige and money they had during Nerath’s heyday came from their
service to the Crown as assassins. One of the reasons they fell was because they
no longer had a benefactor to support their work.</p>

<p>Their patriarch at the time, Lord Andrew Gravelstoke, retired to his last
holdings in the remote Nentir Vale and took most of his surviving relatives with
him. There he eventually passed and left his children to squander the last of
the family fortune. All that remains is their bleak stone mansion in the Barony
of Harkenwold, and a modest summer retreat just outside of Fallcrest.</p>

<p>The current patriarch is Andrew’s grandson Xander. After decades of bickering
has managed to unite most of the family behind the singular purpose of
recovering their old prestige and fortune. And they intend to do that by taking
up the old family trade: murdering people.</p>

<p>Xander has been making contact with the family’s old business partners, former
rivals, and anyone who is in need of a spot of murder to let them know the
Gravelstokes are once again for hire. They’ve kept the old family techniques
alive and even improved on them, so the quality of their service is assured.</p>

<p>The family’s main field operatives are Xander himself, his three younger
siblings, and his son. Xander also takes counsel from his uncle Barin and his
widowed sister-in-law Lenore. His young wife Regan is attractive, demure, and
knows how to keep a secret, but doesn’t have any direct involvement in the
“business”. She’s Xander’s third wife: the first two failed to meet his approval
and suffered convenient accidents.</p>

<p>The siblings are named Mikus, Tovin, and Alesia. Mikus and Tovin are twins, and
the trio is inseparable. They go everywhere together, whether on a job or just
traveling for fun. There are dark rumors floating around about the carnality of
their relationship and its “debased offspring”, but in a surprising twist for
such a heavily Gothic Horror family, these rumors are all false. They are
however competent and ruthless assassins.</p>

<p>Xander’s son Vincent is more of a serial killer than an assassin, an anti-social
recluse who is very particular about whom he chooses to kill. Xander is at a bit
of a loss about what to do with him, since this behavior is bad for business.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get stats for all combatant Gravelstokes here. They’re all early to
mid-Paragon threats, which likely means their customers are the kind of people
who have designs on the whole of the Vale.</p>

<p>The Gravelstokes’ special training gives them several advantages over typical
humans. They all have Darkvision, and they all know their signature technique
named <strong>Stone Cold Killer</strong>.</p>

<p>Any creature killed by a Gravelstoke-trained assassin is petrified and cannot be
raised from the dead while they remain that way. The killer can end this
petrification by touching the victim and willing them restored, or someone else
can do it by sprinkling a few drops of the killer’s blood on the statue. A
restored victim is still dead, of course, but now they can be returned to life
with a Raise Dead ritual.</p>

<h3 id="vincent-gravelstoke">Vincent Gravelstoke</h3>

<p>Vincent’s tactics in a fight mirror his social behavior: he lurks at the edges
and only steps in when a good opportunity for murder presents itself. He’s a
Level 12 Lurker with 90 HP. His <strong>Poisoned Rapier</strong> does necrotic and poison
damage, and if the attack is made with combat advantage it also inflicts 10
ongoing damage (save ends).</p>

<p>He can also perform a <strong>Shadow Strike</strong>, a standard action which removes him
from play until the start of his next turn. At that time, he reappears within 10
squares of his previous position and can perform a rapier attack that deals
heavy physical damage and prevents the target from spending healing surges (save
ends). It does half damage on a miss.</p>

<p>If pressed, Vincent can <strong>Fade Into the Shadows</strong> as a minor action. This
encounter power makes him insubstantial and grants partial concealment until the
start of his next turn. The effect ends early if he attacks, or if he suffers
radiant damage.</p>

<p>Finally, Vincent’s fencing skill lets him <strong>Parry</strong> melee attacks as an at-will
interrupt that grants him +4 to all defenses against the attack.</p>

<h3 id="tovin-gravelstoke">Tovin Gravelstoke</h3>

<p>One of the twins, Tovin is a deadly sniper. He’s Level 13 Artillery with 96
HP. He wields a <strong>Crossbow of Dread</strong> whose basic attacks grant him a +4 damage
bonus against the target until the end of his next turn. Some of his bolts are
<strong>Poisoned Shot</strong> (recharge 5+), doing the same damage as the basic attack and
inflicting 10 ongoing necrotic and poison damage (save ends). The target also
becomes immobilized after the first failed save, and after the second both
effects are replaced with unconsciousness (save ends).</p>

<p>If hit in melee, Tovin can use <strong>Shadow Escape</strong> (encounter) as a reaction to
deal 5 necrotic damage to the attacker and teleport 5 squares. If he can’t
escape, he’ll fight with his <strong>Dagger of Death</strong>, whose attacks deal necrotic
damage.</p>

<h3 id="mikus-gravelstoke">Mikus Gravelstoke</h3>

<p>The other twin is much more fond of melee combat. He’s a Level 13 Soldier with
128 HP. His <strong>greatsword</strong> deals physical damage and marks for a turn. If a
marked enemy within 5 squares of Mikus makes an attack that doesn’t include him
as a target, he can use <strong>Shadow’s Curse</strong> to deal an automatic 10 necrotic
damage to them, ignoring all resistances and immunities.</p>

<p>He can also use a spell named <strong>Incite The Blood</strong>, a selective Close Burst 3
that pulls targets 2 squares towards him and lets him make a strong melee attack
against each one. In other words, it’s a goth version of Come and Get It.</p>

<h3 id="alesia-gravelstoke">Alesia Gravelstoke</h3>

<p>Alesia is a bit older than the twins, but is still their steadfast sister and
friend. She’s a Level 14 Controller with 140 HP. Her weapon of choice is a
<strong>Bewildering Chakram</strong> that can be used for both melee and ranged attacks. An
enemy hit by either takes 5 extra psychic damage for each square they move
during their next turn. When used as a thrown weapon, the chakram returns to
Alesia’s hand after the attack.</p>

<p>She can also perform a <strong>Reeling Chakram</strong> attack (recharges when first
bloodied). This does about double damage, half on a miss, and also pushes the
target 2 squares and knocks them prone as an effect. Plus she knows enough magic
to cast a <strong>Toxic Tendrils</strong> spell (Area 2 within 10, recharge 5+), which deals
necrotic and poison damage and slows (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="xander-gravelstoke">Xander Gravelstoke</h3>

<p>The patriarch of the family, and its most deadly combatant. Xander is a Level 16
Elite Skirmisher with the Leader tag and 304 HP. He wields paired short swords
in a fight. The basic <strong>sword</strong> attack deals physical damage and slides the
target 1 square. Xander can also <strong>Lunge</strong> (recharge 5+) which lets him shift up
to half his speed before the attack and deals increased damage. Both attacks
ignore 10 points of resistance, which is only likely to come up against targets
that have Resist All since what I call “physical” damage is actually untyped.</p>

<p>Once per encounter Xander can use a <strong>Shadow Step</strong> to teleport 5 squares and
gain partial concealment for a turn.</p>

<p>Xander’s minor actions are where his Leaderly and Elite-y maneuvers
are. <strong>Off-Hand Swipe</strong> lets him shift 2 squares and then make a sword attack
that deals slightly less damage than a basic one. Combining this with the basic
attack lets Xander efficiently herd PCs. Once per encounter he can use <strong>Quick
Rally</strong> to affect all allies within 3 squares. Affected allies can shift 2
squares and make a melee basic attack, though each of them must attack a
different creature.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Like the Barrowhaunts, the Gravelstokes are a party of Evil NPCs that pair very
well with each other. Having one of the PCs’ enemies hire them to kill the PCs
is the most obvious way to include them in the adventure, though there are other
ways that can be as or more fun.</p>

<p>You might, for example, add them to your campaign much earlier, still in the
early Heroic Tier, as a source of ominous foreshadowing. They do have a summer
estate in Fallcrest where they can go to pose as slightly eccentric nobles while
Xander and Uncle Barin negotiate new contracts. It’s also possible to have a
Heroic Tier murder mystery where the victim turned to stone after death. The PCs
might not be able to determine the identity of the actual killer beyond “a
mysterious hired assassin”, and then the goal becomes finding the mastermind.</p>

<p>The family is not really interested in Nerath as an ideal - they care only about
regaining their own prestige and wealth. That could happen in a reborn Nerath,
or it could happen in an empire by any other name. So they might consider any of
the “revivalist” factions as prospective clients or as deluded upstarts
depending on how deep their purses are.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This is another Vale-specific faction, and a cool one.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Winterbole forest takes up nearly the entire northern edge of the Vale. This
snowy conifer forest is home to several different factions that exist in uneasy
equilibrium, and the Frost Witches are one of the most powerful.</p>

<p>The Witches worship the primordial Cryonax, one of the Evil Elemental Princes,
but no one outside their group knows about this. To most other inhabitants of
the Vale they’re “merely” scary forest witches who manipulate and terrify others
for their own benefit.</p>

<p>The Frost Witches count elves, humans, harpies and gnomes among their
number. Every one of them knows how to use magic, and the vast majority are
female. They increase their numbers mostly through active recruiting, which
might mean kidnapping children from communities bordering the woods as often as
it means inducting consenting adults into the coven. Their leader is the elf
witch Clenderi, which rules the group with absolute authority second only to
Cryonax himself.</p>

<p>The Witches are spread out through the whole Winterbole forest, in scattered
huts housing either lone individuals or small groups of less than half a
dozen. Their central headquarters is known simply as “Cold Camp”, and it’s
important not only because it’s Clenderi’s home but also because it houses the
source of their power, an artifact known as the Cold Cauldron.</p>

<p>The Cauldron is entirely made of ice, and a frozen flame burns eternally
underneath it. Standing too close to it is hazardous to anyone who’s not a
Witch, and it causes a wide area around itself to be covered in frost.</p>

<p>The Witches have no true friends outside their own group. Any alliances they
make with others are opportunistic and likely to be temporary. They are
absolutely willing to turn on these allies if circumstances change.</p>

<p>The Tigerclaw barbarians who also live in the Winterbole forest have been burned
by this enough times that they now attempt to kill any Frost Witches they meet
on sight. The Witches are wary around their territory but don’t consider them a
serious threat. They maintain much better relations with the Winterbole treants,
and are engaging on a subtle campaign of manipulation against the dragon
Bitterstrike, intending to eventually convert her to the worship of Cryonax.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We start off with stats for the Cauldron, which will be relevant to any battle
that happens inside Cold Camp. It’s 6 feet in diameter, so you could say it’s
Large. Rules-wise it counts as an indestructible terrain feature, emitting an
aura of <strong>Icy Flames</strong> (2) that deals cold damage to any enemy of the Witches
who ends their turn inside. It also turns the terrain inside the whole of Cold
Camp into <strong>Frozen Ground</strong>, which is difficult terrain for anyone without Ice
Walk.</p>

<p>As you might expect, all stat blocks in this entry have Ice Walk and a lot of
cold magic powers, along with resistance to cold and a vulnerability to
fire. They also retain their racial traits, if any.</p>

<h3 id="icicle-swarm">Icicle Swarm</h3>

<p>This is a Medium swarm of Tiny, sharp ice elementals that the Witches known how
to summon and control. It’s a Level 6 Skirmisher with 68 HP and all the standard
swarm traits. Their <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura deals 5 cold damage to enemies inside,
and their basic attack is an <strong>Icicle Stab</strong> that deals cold damage, allows them
to shift 2 squares before or after the attack, and immobilizes on a critical hit
(save ends).</p>

<h3 id="frost-witch">Frost Witch</h3>

<p>A typical member of the group. This one is human, but you can make her an elf or
gnome by adding the proper traits. She’s a Level 8 Controller with 87 HP. She
projects a <strong>Frost Aura</strong> (1) that makes enemies inside vulnerable 5 to cold. If
the enemy was resistant to cold, this reduces their resistance, otherwise it
increases any cold damage they suffer as normal.</p>

<p>The witch fights in melee with a <strong>Frost Staff</strong> that deals cold damage and
slides 2 squares on a hit. At range she uses a <strong>Snow Blindness</strong> spell that
deals cold and radiant damage. Cold resistance alone won’t protect you from it!
Targets hit by the spell can’t see anything further than 3 squares away (save
ends).</p>

<p>Once per encounter she can cast an <strong>Icy Blast</strong> (close blast 5) which deals
cold damage, half on a miss, and turns the affected area into a zone of
difficult terrain. This lasts a turn but can be sustained with minor actions.</p>

<h3 id="frost-witch-harpy">Frost Witch Harpy</h3>

<p>Harpy members tend to be a little stronger than the others, and their cold magic
is geared towards enhancing their natural powers. They’re Level 12 Controllers
with 123 HP. They add thunder resistance to the standard Frost Witch traits, and
can fly with a speed of 8 (clumsy). Their <strong>Frost Aura</strong> has a radius of 2. They
fight with <strong>Frost Claws</strong> that do cold damage, ranged <strong>Icy Stares</strong> that do
cold damage and slow, and a <strong>Chilling Screech</strong> encounter power that hits a
Close Burst 2, does cold and thunder damage, and if the target was slowed or
immobilized also inflicts ongoing 10 cold damage (save ends).</p>

<p>They’re going to wait to use the screech once multiple players are slowed by
their stare, or by their allies’ powers.</p>

<h3 id="frozen-cauldron-guardian">Frozen Cauldron Guardian</h3>

<p>These elementals are made of frozen mist, and as their name implies they hang
around the Cauldron to protect it from thieves and intruders. They’re Level 15
Brutes with 179 HP. Despite its misty look. Its diffuse nature makes it hard to
hurt but that is represented by its high level and HP total - the creature is
not insubstantial.</p>

<p>The guardian’s basic attack is called <strong>Cold Snap</strong>. It deals cold damage and
causes the target to fall prone. It can also expand itself temporarily for a
<strong>Enveloping Chill</strong> attack (recharge 4+), a Close Burst 1 that deals a bit less
cold damage and knocks prone. It also has an extra rider: targets hit by the
attack take ongoing 10 cold damage and are unable to stand up (save ends both).</p>

<p>Anyone fighting these things will stay prone for most of the fight, which makes
every PC’s job more difficult. They pair really well with melee monsters that
can exploit combat advantage.</p>

<h3 id="clenderi">Clenderi</h3>

<p>The leader of the Frost Witches is probably one of the most powerful individuals
in the Vale. Any fight against her will likely take place near the Frozen
Cauldron, so she can expect help from a bunch of Guardians and any other
high-ranking witches the GM cares to stat up.</p>

<p>Clenderi is an elf, and a Level 18 Elite Controller with the Leader tag and 344
HP. She projects a <strong>Frost Aura</strong> that inflicts Vulnerable 5 Cold on any enemies
while they’re inside. She also has the usual elven <strong>Wild Step</strong> that lets her
ignore difficult terrain when she shifts. She already ignores ice-based terrain
anyway due to Ice Walk, but it’s also hard to restrict her movement in other
ways. She can also benefit from <strong>Elven Accuracy</strong> once per encounter, which
lets her reroll an attack roll that she dislikes and take the second
result. In practical terms, she can reroll an attack she missed.</p>

<p>Clenderi’s <strong>Frost Staff</strong> basic attack works like that of the typical frost
witch, dealing cold damage and sliding 2 squares. Her <strong>Icy Glare</strong> is an
at-will ranged attack that deals cold damage and immobilizes. She can cast a
<strong>Wind of Winter</strong> spell (recharge 5+) that deals cold damage in a selectice
Area Burst 2 and creates a zone of icy wind that lasts for a turn. This is
difficult terrain to creatures without ice walk, and allows Clenderi’s allies
who are inside to spend a move action to teleport 10 squares to a space outside
the zone.</p>

<p>Her ultimate technique is the <strong>Frostfall</strong> encounter power, a Close Blast 3
that deals cold damage and turns victims to ice! This is equivalent to being
petrified, and is a (save ends) condition. On a miss, the target takes half
damage and is restrained for a turn.</p>

<p>All of her spells target Fortitude, so most of the party’s squishies are going
to be especially vulnerable to them.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The greatest thing about the Frost Witches are their interactions with the other
factions in the Winterbole Forest. The basic idea of an ice cult conspiring to
take over the world really comes alive when you factor in those interactions and
can see how they actually interact with the world around them.</p>

<p>Felldrakes are a Vale-specific new addition to the game.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Shortly after signing the pact that transformed them, the ruling nobility of
Bael Turath set about applying their newfound infernal power in several ways
they felt would benefit the empire. One of the things they did was magically
alter the many breeds of drake the Turathi already employed to make them
stronger and more vicious. These magically altered breeds became known as
felldrakes.</p>

<p>Though felldrakes are considered natural animals, they’re much more aggressive
and territorial than other species and are susceptible to control via old
Turathi techniques and infernal magic. The Fell Court from our previous entry
was taught the secret of controlling these creatures by their diabolical
patrons. It’s possible other groups have learned it as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Like other drakes, these are Natural Beasts. They’re a varied lot, though, and
their abilities are specific to each stat block.</p>

<h3 id="leaping-felldrake">Leaping Felldrake</h3>

<p>This Small drake looks like a green-scaled lizard. As the name implies they’re
capable of long flying leaps, but they’re also pretty good at lying in
ambush. Their jaws are very efficient at biting the necks of their victims, and
their saliva contains a weak venom that turns the flesh around the bite mark
blue. They were used to protect homes and vaults from burglars, and those blue
marks aided in tracking any culprits that escaped.</p>

<p>Leaping Felldrakes are Level 1 Lurkers with 26 HP. They have ground and climb
speeds of 6. Their basic <strong>bites</strong> are a little weak, but they can use <strong>Neck
Bites</strong> against targets granting them combat advantage. This deals about double
the damage of a basic bite and allow the drake to grab the target (escape DC
12), dealing them ongoing 5 damage while the grab lasts.</p>

<p>The drake’s <strong>Flying Leaps</strong> allow them to fly 3 squares without provoking
opportunity attacks. If they have cover, concealment, or no enemies within 5
squares, they can use <strong>Instant Camouflage</strong> to become effectively invisible
until they attack or cancel the effect. That’s how it gains combat advantage in
most situations, though flanking also works fine in a fight against multiple
monsters.</p>

<h3 id="crested-felldrakes">Crested Felldrakes</h3>

<p>These Small drakes are kinda like a cross between a standard <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/01/27/drakes.html">guard drake</a>
and a Jurassic Park raptor. They’re pack hunters like unmodified guard drakes,
but they’re stronger and smarter than then. Crested felldrakes have been known
to climb on top of one another to reach high places, or to open doors with their
claws to get at victims on the other side.</p>

<p>Crested Felldrakes are Level 2 Skirmishers with 39 HP. They have a ground speed
of 8 and their <strong>Pack Frenzy</strong> trait gives them +1 to hit and +2 to damage when
adjacent to a felldrake ally. Their <strong>bites</strong> damage and allow a felldrake ally
within 2 squares of the attacker to shift up to 2 squares as a reaction. When
hit by an opportunity attack, they can automatically shift 2 squares. This
doesn’t negate the damage from the attack, but it also doesn’t use up an action,
so it can be done as often as you like. The more you hit them, the more mobile
they are.</p>

<h3 id="hissing-felldrake">Hissing Felldrake</h3>

<p>Another Jurassic Park-inspired monstrosity, this is a Medium drake with a large
folding frill around its neck and the ability to spit a corrosive venom laced
with soporific chemicals. It’s Level 3 Artillery with 38 HP.</p>

<p>They can <strong>bite</strong> but the star of the show is clearly their <strong>Fell Spit</strong>, a
ranged attack that targets Reflex and deals acid damage. If the target is
bloodied, they become slowed for a turn. If they’re already slowed, they instead
become dazed (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="tri-horned-felldrake">Tri-Horned Felldrake</h3>

<p>The larger and most aggressive of the felldrake subspecies, but also oddly
enough the easiest to domesticate. The Turathi enforced an instinctive pecking
order with tri-horns at the top, so they have some ability to control other
felldrake species.</p>

<p>Tri-horns are Medium Level 4 Soldiers with 58 HP. They have a speed of 5, are
immmune to fear, and gain a +3 to damage when charging. They can <strong>bite</strong> and
also perform <strong>challenging gores</strong> that deal about the same damage and mark for
a turn. If a marked target makes an attack that doesn’t target the drake, it can
use a melee reaction to automatically deal light damage and knock them prone.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The origin of the felldrakes gives you ample excuse to have a wild pack of them
that attacks on sight and fights to the death, unlike most natural
beasts. However they really come into their own as pets to the Fell Court or to
other similar groups that know how to control and boost them in the same way.</p>

<p>They could also be used as additional Dark Drake species to go with the Dark
Drake of the Moon Hills. Maybe the Dark Drake is a supernaturally powerful
felldrake who survives since the days of Bael Turath?</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>We just looked at a faction of Arkhosian revivalists, and now we’re looking at
an example of their Turathi counterparts.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Even long after the fall of Bael Turath, tieflings still have to contend with
the suspicions and prejudice of others. You could argue such suspicion was
warranted right after that fall, since the people who became the first tieflings
had all been members of the Turathi elite, and therefore quite nasty
slave-holding diabolists. Their descendants however were just born that way and
are as varied in their moral outlook as any other sapient people. It is wrong to
expect them to be scheming diabolists just because of their looks.</p>

<p>And then you have people like the Fell Court, who keep the stereotype alive by
living up to it. They’re a group of tieflings based on Fallcrest who want to
Make Bael Turath Great Again. Their leader is one Melech Ambrose, a
self-proclaimed general and visionary who can trace his ancestry very precisely
to a specific noble lineage.</p>

<p>Despite all his claims, Ambrose acts more like a petty crime lord than as a
would-be ruler. His group’s current activities are all aimed at filling their
“war chest” so the “real” takeover can begin. They have only recently stepped up
their operations, and though the Lord Warden of Fallcrest has heard rumors, his
men have so far failed to turn up any concrete information about the Court.</p>

<p>Ambrose himself has a public life as a successful trader and contacts among
several members of Fallcrest’s high society. He uses this as cover to run a
modest black market operation that enjoys the favor of many of the city’s
poorest residents, since they operate in the slums and provide some of the
support and security the city’s government can’t or won’t get them.</p>

<p>Most of the Court’s operating budget comes from Melech Ambrose’s criminal
enterprise. They’ve stepped up their recruitment efforts, and are setting up
caches of weapons and supplies for a future takeover of Fallcrest. The money
also sees good use gathering information about the city’s defenses and blackmail
material for use against its officials.</p>

<p>As you would expect from such a fan of old Bael Turath, Melech is a diabolist,
and his dealings have got him a measure of supernatural support from infernal
patrons. This include control over a large pack of Felldrakes, a species of
vicious drakes that used to be bred in Bael Turath.</p>

<p>Recruitment happens through a couple of layers of deception. The Court stages a
“false flag” attack on a potential candidate, and then swoops in for the
rescue. A member of the “rescue team” befriends the target and then the Court
slowly brings them into the group while probing their potential and loyalty to
the Turathi cause. A member who looks like a good fit gets contacted by an
underboss, who gives them a “trial by fire” mission that consists of committing
a crime suited to their abilities that also advances the interests of the
Court. Those who prove the extent of their skill and loyalty by successfully
performing this mission are made full members of the Court. Those who reveal
themselves incompatible end up murdered in a way that points to one of the
Court’s rivals.</p>

<p>All of that is for tieflings. Non-tieflings never really progress beyond the
stage of “disposable tool”.</p>

<p>Melech has also heard of the Iron Circle, an Asmodeus-worshiping mercenary
company from the south who is entering the Vale through the Harkenwold
region. He believes he can enter an alliance with them, offering his Fell
Court’s services as spies and saboteurs and using the Circle’s military might to
conquer the Vale so they can rule together. Though he has yet to hear back from
them after making his initial diplomatic overtures, he’s absolutely sure they
will be successful. This belief may lead him to act rashly.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>All of our stat blocks here are for tiefling members of the Fell Court. As such
they all have Low-Light Vision and Resist Fire 5. They tend to me at low-to-mid
Heroic levels, making them appropriate as your group’s first “urban intrigue”
antagonists in Fallcrest.</p>

<p>Let’s look at them in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="fell-court-ruffian">Fell Court Ruffian</h3>

<p>Ruffians are the some of the lowest-ranking members of the Court, individuals
who probably have not undergone their trial by fire yet. They’re Level 2 Minion
Brutes. They fight with <strong>clubs</strong> that deal half damage on a miss, and have a
<strong>Dances with Drakes</strong> ability that allows them to make a free attack against an
enemy that has just been hit by a drake ally.</p>

<h3 id="fell-court-creep">Fell Court Creep</h3>

<p>The same ranking as a Ruffian, but sneakier. Creeps are Level 3 Minion
Skirmishers. Their basic attack is a <strong>Dazing Dagger</strong> that damages and dazes
for a turn, and when they’re missed by an attack <strong>Fiendish Shift</strong> allows them
to shift 1 square and deal 3 fire damage to the target.</p>

<h3 id="fell-court-blackheart">Fell Court Blackheart</h3>

<p>A seasoned Court operative, combining mundane stealth training with a side of
infernal magic. They’re Level 2 Lurkers with 37 HP.</p>

<p>Blackhearts fight with <strong>Deadly Sickles</strong> that deal necrotic damage, and can
spend their action to assume a <strong>Smoke Form</strong> instead of attacking. While in
smoke form, they can’t attack or be attacked, and can pass through and occupy
other creatures’ spaces. It can revert as a free action, or when it drops to 0
HP (from ongoing damage or something).</p>

<p>If the blackheart starts its turn in smoke form, it can use a <strong>Sly Attack</strong> to
target Reflex and deal about double the damage of a basic attack, half on a
miss. It can also use this power without turning to smoke, but it doesn’t do
double damage then.</p>

<p>They can use the tiefling’s standard <strong>Infernal Wrath</strong> power to inflict a bit
of fire damage on someone who just hit them, and when they’re reduced to 0 HP
they can delete a healing surge from an enemy they can see before dropping.</p>

<p>If the blackheart damages an enemy that was granting combat advantage to it,
they stop that enemy from spending healing surges (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="fell-court-underboss">Fell Court Underboss</h3>

<p>This veteran Court member has proven to be loyal enough to be promoted, and is
now in charge of recruiting new members and sending them on jobs. It’s a Level 3
Soldier with 47 HP and the Leader keyword.</p>

<p>The underboss is a <strong>Drake Wrangler</strong>, and gives Resist Fire 5 and a +2 bonus to
the AC of any drakes adjacent to it. It also projects a <strong>Hellbound</strong> aura (1)
that deals 5 fire damage to any creature that leaves it. Its <strong>bastard sword</strong>
strikes kind of skip the whole marking business. A target hit by the sword
suffers 5 fire damage if it doesn’t target the underboss with an attack during
their next turn.</p>

<p>They can also use the sword in a <strong>Diabolical Strike</strong> that deals fire damage
and, if the attack was made with combat advantage, prevents the target from
shifting for a turn. <strong>Infernal Wrath</strong> rounds out the tiefling’s arsenal.</p>

<p>Underbosses will always be in a tight formation with a pack of drakes, and will
seek to stay adjacent to a PC. Scattering those drakes might be a useful tactic,
since they’d take damage from Hellbound.</p>

<h3 id="fell-court-hellmage">Fell Court Hellmage</h3>

<p>An underboss-rank Court member who prefers to rely more on magic than on
swords. It’s Level 4 Artillery with 42 HP and the Leader keyword. Its aura of
<strong>Drake Regeneration</strong> (3) causes any bloodied drake ally inside to recover 5 HP
at the start of their turns if they have at least one HP left.</p>

<p>Hellmages fight with <strong>daggers</strong> in melee and shoot <strong>Infernal Bolts</strong> at
range. These deal both immediate and ongoing fire and radiant damage. Infernal
Wrath works as standard for them, and when they drop to 0 HP they use <strong>See you
In Hell</strong> to fire off one last infernal bolt without provoking opportunity
attacks.</p>

<h3 id="melech-ambrose">Melech Ambrose</h3>

<p>The big boss is a unique Level 5 Skirmisher with 68 HP and the Leader
keyword. As a regular, Melech will always have plenty of bodyguards and
felldrakes with him. He projects two auras: <strong>Bloodthirsty</strong> (radius 1) makes
all enemies inside grant combat advantage; and <strong>Drake Fervor</strong> (radius 3) gives
drake allies inside a +2 bonus to damage and to saves.</p>

<p>Melech himself fights with a <strong>scimitar</strong>, which can be used for basic attacks
or <strong>Fiendish Strikes</strong> that allow him to shift 2 squares before or after the
attack, and, if made with combat advantage, daze for a turn. He can also <strong>hurl
flame</strong> to strike at range, dealing fire damage. Infernal Wrath works as normal
for him.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think it’s a bit unfortunate that the Fell Court lives up to the bad
reputation tieflings have, but it does give heroic PC tieflings an extra reason
to fight them. The first time I read this entry, I thought it was odd that they
went into that much detail about their recruitment process, but it’s a perfect
ready-made story hook to get one of those heroic PC tieflings involved with
them.</p>

<p>Any fight against Fell Court members should absolutely include a couple of fell
drakes at least. Another thing I hadn’t noticed until now is how central drakes
are to their whole flavor - every stat block here has some interaction with
drake allies. A “final battle” encounter against Melech, an Underboss, a
Hellmage and a troop of drakes will have the latter punch above their weight
class with bonuses to AC, damage, saves, and regeneration.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This is another setting-specific group.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Dythan’s Legion is a large all-dragonborn military organization. As the name
implies, their leader is Legatus Dythan, an ambitious and charismatic leader who
dreams of seeing Arkhosia restored to its ancient glory, presumably with him at
the top.</p>

<p>The Legion uses the same ranks and organization as the ancient armies of
Arkhosia, and numbers about 500 members in total, usually operating in platoons
of 20 to 24 people. These are supported by war-trained drakes and behemoths, and
sometimes even by salvaged Arkhosian battle constructs.</p>

<p>Upon admission into the Legion, every member is branded with a symbol that used
to be a Turathi slave marking. Dythan’s ancestors in the Drakerider clan used to
live in the border between Arkhosia and Bael Turath, and were taken captive in a
Turathi raid. After they were freed or escaped their enslavement, they took the
mark for their own as a reminder of what Arkhosia was fighting against, and
passed it onto their descendants. Dythan himself bears such a mark, and makes
sure his soldiers remember as he does.</p>

<p>Though the Legion usually operates far south of the Vale, a contingent of them
arrived here recently looking for ruins of Arkhosian outposts that are said to
have been here back in the old days. One of them, Rolaz-Gaar, is somewhere along
the shores of Lake Nen (in the NE corner of the Vale). Another might be
somewhere beneath the Ogrefist Hills near the Vale’s western border. The Legion
detachments concentrate in these two locations.</p>

<p>Despite being fairly small when compared to those ancient imperial armies, the
Legion is still a large force by the standards of our narrative present, and its
members are well-trained and well-equipped professionals. They’re not interested
in conquering the Vale, but they’re unlikely to be very nice to anyone who
stands in the way of their search. It’s unclear from the text whether Dythan
himself is in the Vale at the moment. If the GM judges the ruins contain
something really important, then he’s likely to be here overseeing the searches
personally. If he’s not, a sufficient challenge to the Legion’s operations in
the area might result in him appearing with reinforcements.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The actual people who make up the legion are all dragonborn, and their elite
training places them as early Paragon threats. We also get stats for their
salvaged Arkhosian siege towers, and for the Liondrakes they use as mounts. They
use other drakes and behemoths in various roles, but those use the base
stats for these creatures, perhaps leveled-up to match their handlers.</p>

<p>As dragonborn, all members of Dythan’s Legion can use <strong>Dragon Breath</strong>, which
like the PC version is an encounter power that lets them breathe energy in a
Close Burst 3 vs. Reflex. The damage type varies per stat block, and can be
changed to match specific individuals. They also have Speed 6, and the
non-minions have the PC trait that gives them +1 to hit while bloodied.</p>

<p>Alignment-wise, every dragonborn here including Dythan has the Evil alignment,
which paints us an interesting picture combined with the slave marking story in
the Lore section. You could perhaps see them as greedy and ruthless imperialists
who are nevertheless vehemently against slavery in all its forms. It would also
be relatively easy to say they focus on the less-bad parts of Arkhosia’s past
and make them Unaligned. Making them actively heroic is more of a stretch, I
feel, and would require bigger changes to their background.</p>

<p>Like we did with the Daggerburg goblins, we’ll look at them in order of
increasing level.</p>

<h3 id="dythans-legion-warrior">Dythan’s Legion Warrior</h3>

<p>The rank and file of the Legion is made up of these veteran soldiers. They’re
Level 10 Minion Skirmishers wearing leather armor and carrying heavy
shields. They fight with spears in melee, and can throw javelins at range.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Phalanx Formation</strong> trait gives them an extra +1 AC per adjacent ally,
up to a maximum of +4. This would be a big no-no on a regular monster (remember
MM1 hobgoblins?) but it’s OK to have on a minion since you only need to hit them
once.</p>

<p>The <strong>Spear</strong> Attack deals a bit of extra damage when they have combat
advantage, and allows the warrior to shift 1 square before or after the
attack. The <strong>Javelin</strong> is a standard ranged attack. Their breath is lightning.</p>

<p>PCs are unlikely to meet legionnaires in numbers smaller than a platoon, and
this stat block helps fill out those numbers without making the encounter
impossible. They can be easily made into regulars if you need more powerful
infantry for an encounter.</p>

<h3 id="dythans-legion-archer">Dythan’s Legion Archer</h3>

<p>These are battlefield archers, so they’re trained to put a lot of arrows into a
group of clustered targets. They’re Level 10 Artillery with 84 HP. The <strong>short
sword</strong> and <strong>Longbow</strong> basic attacks are solid, with the latter being the
better option. They can also fire an <strong>Arrow Volley</strong> (recharge 4+) that targets
enemies in an Area Burst 1 within 20 squares and does light physical damage to
each one it hits.</p>

<p>Their <strong>dragon breath</strong> deals cold damage and also pushes 1 square on a hit,
making it a good “keep-away” emergency power.</p>

<h3 id="dythans-legion-vanguard">Dythan’s Legion Vanguard</h3>

<p>Vanguards march into battle at the front of the Legion’s infantry formations,
engaging the enemy directly to give space for the mobile Warriors to flank
them. They’re Level 11 Soldiers with 111 HP, wear plate, and carry swords and
heavy shields.</p>

<p>They have the same <strong>Phalanx Formation</strong> trait as the Warriors, which means they
punch above far above their weight as far as AC is concerned. If you can’t
isolate them from their allies, hit them in the non-armor defenses!</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>Longsword</strong> attack marks for a turn on a hit, and they can use
minor actions to <strong>shield bash</strong> marked targets. This does no damage, but dazes
for a turn. <strong>Vanguard’s Mark</strong> (recharge when first bloodied) allows them to
mark a target that’s up to 5 squares away with a minor action. If the marked
target doesn’t end their next turn adjacent to the vanguard, the vanguard can
charge it as a free action that doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. This makes
the power an excellent way to hit the PC’s squishies.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Dragon Breath</strong> does poison damage.</p>

<h3 id="dythans-legion-dragoon">Dythan’s Legion Dragoon</h3>

<p>Real-world dragoons were so named because they were cavalry that carried
firearms (so their weapons “spat fire”). The dragoons of Dythan’s Legion got
this name from the fact that they ride the next best thing to an actual dragon.</p>

<p>Dragoons are Level 12 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 119 HP. They wear
leather like the infantry, and carry <strong>lances</strong> into combat. Most of their
abilities are related to mounted combat. The <strong>Masterful Rider</strong> trait negates 1
square of all forced movement imposed upon them if they’re mounted; the
<strong>Incensed Mount</strong> reaction allows their mount to make a free basic attack
against an enemy who damages the rider; and even their basic lance attack knocks
prone on a hit if the dragoon is mounted.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Battlefield Mastery</strong> power (recharge 4+) is a minor action that allows
every ally in a Close Burst 2 to shift 1 square. And yeah, the mount is an
ally. Their <strong>Dragon Breath</strong> does acid damage.</p>

<p>Dragoons are quite dangerous when mounted! Canny PCs will seek to knock them
down and prevent them from remounting again.</p>

<h3 id="liondrake">Liondrake</h3>

<p>Captured young in the distant deserts of the south, these Large Natural Beasts
are the mount of choice for Dythan’s Dragoons. They look a lot like dragons, and
have many of the same attacks, but are not sapient and lack breath weapons. The
specimen statted up here has been trained as a war mount and is a Level 12
Skirmisher with 122 HP. It has a ground speed of 7, a fly speed of 10, and
Darkvision.</p>

<p>The drake’s <strong>Fierce Mount</strong> trait gives both it and its rider a +4 bonus to
defenses against opportunity attacks. It has both a <strong>bite</strong> and a <strong>claw</strong> as
basic attacks, and can perform <strong>Battle Leaps</strong> that allow it to shift up to 4
squares and then either bite once or claw twice. It has a <strong>Terrifying Roar</strong>
encounter power that is kinda like dragon breath, targeting a Close Blast 5,
doing thunder damage, and dazing (save ends).</p>

<p>Liondrakes are dangerous even on their own, but they synergize very well with
Dragoons. They also make great mounts for other kinds of paragon-tier “rider”
opponents.</p>

<h3 id="arkhosian-siege-tower">Arkhosian Siege Tower</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wit-tnv-dythans-legion-tower.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These are ancient constructs built by Arkhosia and salvaged by the Legion. They
were either brought to the vale from the South, or salvaged from local Arkhosian
ruins depending on how you want to play it in your campaign. They are 30-foot
tall and 15-foot wide stone towers that move on 10-foot tall granite rollers.</p>

<p>A tower can transport troops in its two internal floors, allowing them to
disembark on enemy battlements. On top of it is a sculpted dragon head that can
swivel in a 360-degree arc and shoot fireballs at enemies. Being a construct,
the tower is capable of driving and shooting by itself, though if it gets too
damaged its occupants will dearly feel the lack of internal safety equipment.</p>

<p>Arkosian Siege Towers are Huge Natural Animates with the Construct keyword and
336 HP. They’re immune to charm, disease, and poison, and have Resist 15 to all
damage originating from outside themselves. The rest of their stat block really
stretches the format in an attempt to model all they can do, starting with a
trio of very interesting traits:</p>

<p><strong>All-Around Vision</strong> means they don’t grant combat advantage when flanked;
<strong>Juggernaut</strong> means it ignores difficult terrain and doesn’t provoke
opportunity attacks, but it also can’t squeeze, make OAs, or grab
creatures. <strong>Living Building</strong> has a list of effects as long as my arm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The tower can occupy other creature’s spaces, and other creatures can end
their movement in its spaces. That’s rules-talk for “it can fit people inside
itself”. When it moves, creatures inside move along with it as if it was a
vehicle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tower is 30 feet tall and has two internal 15-foot tall levels. The
Athletics DC for climbing it from the outside is 20.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lower level has two iron double doors (break DC 25) that it can open and
close as a free action. When the doors are closed, there is no line of sight
or effect between the inside and outside.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The upper level has arrow slits that allow occupants to shoot outside. It’s
linked to the lower level by 2 ladders.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the <strong>Rough Ride</strong> trait models how damage impacts the tower. While
bloodied, the tower is slowed and inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks on all its
occupants.</p>

<p>As a construct, the tower has two attacks. The <strong>Dragon’s Head</strong> shoots
fireballs (Area 1 within 20) that deal immediate and ongoing fire damage, half
on a miss. And it can <strong>Crush</strong> with its move action, which allows it to make
attacks against any creatures whose spaces it enters during the move.</p>

<p>When the tower drops to 0 HP, it <strong>Collapses</strong>, making an attack vs. the Reflex
of every occupant that deals heavy damage and knocks them prone on a hit. The
tower’s space becomes difficult terrain (a giant pile of rubble!).</p>

<p>The stats make no mention of a disembarking ramp on the second level, but it’s
easy to say there is one there. It’d be as sturdy as the ground floor doors, and
controlled in the same way.</p>

<p>The best way to fight a siege tower is from inside, where you can bypass its DR
and “only” have to contend with its occupants. These are likely to be a
combination of vanguards and archers.</p>

<h3 id="legatus-dythan">Legatus Dythan</h3>

<p>Dythan is big and imposing even for a Dragonborn. He wears an ornate suit of
plate adorned with Arkhosian heraldic devices done in gold inlay. He’s not just
a competent general, but an extremely skilled combatant as well.</p>

<p>Dythan is a Level 15 Elite Soldier with 290 HP and the Leader keyword. He wears
his nifty armor suit and carries a shield, a sword and a brace of javelins into
battle. He has the same <strong>Phalanx Formation</strong> trait as his vanguards, and
projects a <strong>Last Stand</strong> aura (5) that gives allies inside a +2 bonus to damage
while they’re bloodied. He also gains at +2 to hit while bloodied himself,
instead of the usual +1 for dragonborn.</p>

<p>Dythan might be a Soldier but he doesn’t mark anyone. Instead he wants the PCs
to mark him! His <strong>longsword</strong> deals bonus damage if the target is marking
Dythan or has an active defender aura. If an enemy marks an ally within 5
squares of Dythan, he can use <strong>Dythan’s Challenge</strong> to transfer the mark to
himself.</p>

<p>As a minor action he can perform a <strong>Shield Bash</strong>, which damages, pushes 1
square, and allows the legate to shift 1 square to follow. This is a full attack
with standard damage because he’s an elite. Those javelins are <strong>Shock
Javelins</strong> that deal lightning damage. And finally, his <strong>Dragon Breath</strong> is the
traditional fire.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I really like Dythan’s Legion. They’re a major threat compared to almost
everything else in the Vale, but they’re focused on doing their own thing and
have no reason to be immediately hostile to the PCs.</p>

<p>Depending on how villainous you want to make them, they might make a good
late-game antagonist faction when they find those ancient ruins and start
bringing in their full numbers to the Vale looking to conquer it and make it
their new base of operations. They might also work as uneasy allies against
other Vale-wide threats, like a full-scale Bloodspear invasion or one of the big
dragons.</p>
