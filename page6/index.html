<p>Weavers have apparently been around since the days of AD&amp;D, appearing in a
Monstrous Compendium Annual there under the name “Spell Weavers”. Their 4e debut
was actually in Dungeon #165, in the adventure titled “Secrets of the White
Lotus Academy”. Here in the MM3 they get updated into a major cosmic threat.</p>

<p>As an aside, it was in a weaver ruin that Kyuss found the writings that let him
become the Worm that Walks, back in the 3e adventure path.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Weaver civilization is incredibly ancient, and what little remains of it seems
to have been somehow shattered and spread across the cosmos. Records recovered
from these few ruins seem to describe a terrible Far Realm incursion that tried
to inject a seed of chaos into our cosmos. The Weavers tried to stop this, and
were only partially successful. This is what shattered them.</p>

<p>To hear the Weavers themselves tell it, their civilization predated even the
gods and primordials, and the event that caused its destruction was in fact what
caused the universe to separate into the Elemental Chaos and the Astral
Sea. Contemporary sages don’t believe this to be true, but the surviving Weavers
certainly do. This belief is at the root of their disdain for all things
divine. To them, the gods are just annoying upstarts. Their own bodies and minds
are the product of aeons of transhuman enhancement. They’re much stronger,
faster, and smarter than your average mortal, and possess an unparalleled
multitasking ability that lets them even cast multiple complex spells at once.</p>

<p>Present-day Weavers preserve as much of their ancient lore as they can, and work
on a grand plan to rebuild their civilization by undoing the planar disjunction
that broke it. Yes, they want to smush the planes back together. If they’re
right, it will be a very bad time for everyone else in the universe. If they’re
wrong, it will be a bad time for absolutely everyone, including themselves.</p>

<p>Their plan has two parts. The first is to restore and repair as many weaver
ruins as possible. Within each one is a planar portal that links all active
ruins into a single network, and a mystical furnace that burns the life force of
mortals and the enchantments that power magic items. By feeding these furnaces,
weavers gather power for the series of rituals that will finally accomplish
their goal.</p>

<p>A weaver will be most likely be found masterminding some plan to gather powerful
mortal souls and magic items. They drain this power through enchanted chromatic
disks that only work for weavers. Every individual carries one of these, though
they specialize in different “flavors” of soul.</p>

<p>Weavers easily form alliances with other powerful groups that have the same
negative opinion of the gods and a nihilistic bent, like tulgars and the
Forsaken. They also hold great influence over the Nerra, leading some scholars
to say the creation story in that entry is wrong and the Nerra are actually
creations of the Weavers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Weavers are Medium Immortal Humanoids. They have Darkvision, a ground speed of
6, and a teleport speed of 6. Their signature trait is <strong>Multitasking Brain</strong>,
which limits the effect of the dazed condition on them: they only lose their
move action, and can still take immediate actions (like interrupts and
reactions).</p>

<p>The other signature trait is more of a design directive: most of a weaver’s
attacks are minor actions, and they’re about as effective as a standard action
from another monster would be. They’re also all Elites.</p>

<p>Each weaver statted below specializes in collecting the souls of characters who
employ a different power source, using that same power source as its main
weapon. There’s one for every power source except divine, whom they consider
beneath them even as fuel for their furnaces. Ironically, this means divine
characters have a bit of an advantage over weavers.</p>

<h3 id="spell-weaver">Spell Weaver</h3>

<p>The classic model, concerned with the collection of arcane power. Spell weavers
usually lead raids into secure locations in order to steal magic itens and
particularly desirable souls. They’re planned months in advance with intel from
spies and divinations, and usually involve the opening of a long-distance portal
as close to the target as possible. Once the spell weaver has what it wants, it
teleports back to the portal and escapes. It’s Level 28 Elite Artillery with 400
HP. Yes, according to this entry the typical weaver is equivalent to a demigod
in power.</p>

<p>They have three basic attacks, all doable as minor actions: <strong>Esoteric Touch</strong>
deals force damage and pushes 5 squares; <strong>Dimensional Ray</strong> allows the weaver
to teleport 2 squares before rolling, deals untyped damage, and teleports the
target 2 squares; and <strong>Esoteric Blast</strong> deals fire damage to its target and an
automatic 10 fire damage to all enemies adjacent to it.</p>

<p>Also as a minor action, it can wield its chromatic disk and cast <strong>Extract
Arcane Soul</strong> (recharge 5+). This can only target characters with arcane
powers. It deals psychic damage and dazes (save ends). On a miss it deals half
damage. Hit or miss, the weaver regains 20 HP. So this doesn’t extract your
whole soul, just a bit of your life force. It’s still bad news!</p>

<p>They also have a standard action attack: <strong>Chilling Echo</strong> can be used to
automatically deal 15 cold damage to all creatures the spell weaver has damaged
since the start of its current turn.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, when the weaver takes damage, it can use <strong>Defensive Jaunt</strong>
as a reaction, becoming invisible and teleporting 20 squares.</p>

<p>The spell weaver’s minor action attacks deal about half the damage you would
expect from the MM3 formula, but the addition of Chilling Echo brings them back
up to their expected potential. Don’t forget to use it!</p>

<h3 id="battleweaver">Battleweaver</h3>

<p>Possibly some of the best warriors in the universe, battleweavers wield 4
exquisitely-crafted swords in combat, and hold their chromatic disk in their
other two hands. They collect the life force of worthy warriors. Battleweavers
are Level 26 Elite Soldiers with 488 HP.</p>

<p>It’s imposssible to duel a battleweaver and come out unscathed, because their
<strong>Blade Mastery</strong> acts as an aura (1) that deals 10 automatic damage to any
enemies inside and marks them for a turn when this happens.</p>

<p>They have a standard <strong>longsword</strong> basic attack, but they’re usually going to
open with one of their two minor-action maneuvers, which also count as basic
attacks. <strong>Quick Jab</strong> deals light physical damage and slides the target 3
squares to a space adjacent to the weaver; <strong>sidestep jab</strong> does the same damage
and allows the weaver to shift 3 squares to a space adjacent to the
target. Combined, they allow the creature to lead its foes on a merry dance
across the field. The basic attack can then act as a “finisher” in the round,
bringing their damage potential to a level a bit above the one expected by the
formula.</p>

<p>Battleweavers can use their chromatic disk to <strong>Extract a Martial Soul</strong>,
targetting characters with martial powers. This is like the spellweaver’s
version: it deals psychic damage, dazes (save ends), and heals the weaver for
about 5% of its total HP (24 in this case).</p>

<p>If an enemy marked by the battleweaver within 10 squares makes an attack that
doesn’t include the weaver as a target, the weaver can teleport to the enemy and
make a melee basic attack against it, as an interrupt. This is the other main
use of their standard-action basic attack.</p>

<p>Battleweavers will use their “jab” strikes to wander around the battlefield and
disrupt PC formations while their aura damages and marks enemies. Like a
swordmage, it will try to stay far away from enemies it has marked, to increase
the chances of their mark triggering. It will use its stronger longsword attacks
to punish mark-ignoring PCs or to pile on more damage on a target it wants to
focus.</p>

<h3 id="thought-weaver">Thought Weaver</h3>

<p>A weaver that specializes in the power of the mind. It usually doesn’t go out
hunting like the others - instead it can be found in weaver ruins working to
restore their gates and furnaces. If forced to fight, it will do so entirely
through the use of psionic powers, barely moving unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Thought weavers are Level 27 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 500
HP. Their basic attacks are minor actions:: <strong>Quick Strike</strong> is a standard melee
attack, and <strong>Mind Spike</strong> is a ranged attack that deals psychic damage,
inflicts a -2 penalty to all defenses for a turn, and slides the target 3
squares. They can also <strong>Extract A Psionic Soul</strong>, targetting a PC with psionic
powers with the same standard Extract Soul effects. As standard actions, it can
use two powerful mind control techniques:</p>

<p><strong>Mental Puppet</strong> is a non-damaging attack that slides the target 5 squares,
forces them to make a basic attack against a target of the weaver’s choice, and
then dominates it (save ends). It recharges when no one is dominated by the
power.</p>

<p><strong>Command the Puppet</strong> automatically hits someone dominated by Mental Puppet. It
deals psychic damage and has the same rider as the other power (slide 5 squares,
make a basic attack).</p>

<p>If someone leaves a square adjacent to the dominated puppet, the weaver can use
<strong>Guardian Puppet</strong> as an interrupt to have the dominated character use a basic
attack against the triggering enemy.</p>

<p>Tought weavers can also choose to spend a standard, move, or minor action
directing a <strong>Coordinated Strike</strong>, which essentially gifts the spent action to
an ally within 5 squares and allows the ally to immediately take that action.</p>

<h3 id="hex-weaver">Hex Weaver</h3>

<p>This is the weaver attuned to the Shadow power source. And what is the Shadow
power source? As far as I know it’s basically “Arcane in a Halloween
costume”. It started getting mentions as something distinct around this time,
and would get a supplement all to itself named Heroes of Shadow the next year.
To my knowledge it never got very popular due to this conceptual confusion with
arcane magic and due to most of its associated classes not being very
good. Anyway, it got a weaver here.</p>

<p>Hex Weavers are too cool to hang out with other weavers, and instead oversee
portals into the Shadowfell from which they launch expeditions to pursue
mysterious goals that may or may not be related to the overall plan of the
weaver civilization.</p>

<p>A Hex Weaver is a Level 27 Elite Lurker with 382 HP, and it’s also too cool to
follow the same rules as the other weavers. Its minor action attacks are
<strong>Extract Shadow Soul</strong>, which has the usual effects but only targets creatures
with shadow powers, and <strong>Shrouded Eye</strong>, a ranged attack that deals psychic
damage and makes the weaver invisible to the target for a turn. The latter can
only be used once per round, which breaks from the pattern.</p>

<p>This is also the weaver with the highest number of standard action powers:
<strong>Shadow Grasp</strong> is a stronger, melee version of Shrouded Eye; <strong>Stinging
Shroud</strong> is a close burst 1 that deals necrotic damage and is much stronger
against creatures granting combat advantage to the weaver. And <strong>Shadow Mask</strong>
is an encounter power that makes it invisible for a turn.</p>

<p>Finally, if the weaver is damaged, it can <strong>Step Into Shadow</strong> (recharge 4+) to
become insubstantial for a turn and teleport its speed as a reaction.</p>

<p>Hex weavers are a bit disappointing. They’d be a lot more dangerous if Shadow
Mask was a recharge or at-will power, or if Shadow Grasp was a minor
action. They also had the problem that there weren’t a lot of shadow-based PCs
around when they were published, because Heroes of Shadow was like six months
away from its release.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m not familiar with weavers from previous editions but I really like their
lore here. The targetting restrictions on their Extract Soul attack do feel a
little artificial, but are easily removed. I don’t like the shadow power source
very much, so I didn’t like Hex Weavers, but the others are quite flavorful and
powerful.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>From what I’ve been able to find out, verbeegs have been in the game since the
days of AD&amp;D 1st Edition, first appearing in the Monster Manual II. This means
the game had already run out of synonyms for “Giant” even back then, since their
name is just a scrunched up form of “Very Big”. This is their 4e debut, with
somewhat new lore.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Verbeegs are a species of small-g giants who live in the same places of the
middle world and the Feywild where you might find hill giants and ogres. The
typical verbeeg is a lazy and greedy trickster who wants to make others work to
keep them in a life of luxury. Their great size and strength helps with this,
but they prefer to use their smarts and trickery to get what they want. Even
when the con is harder than plain robbery, it’s also often more fun for them.</p>

<p>An example tale here is that of a verbeeg who set up at a river bridge and began
charging a toll. The toll was expensive, but the giant promised to only collect
it when the traveller came back to their side of the river. Travellers would lie
and promise they’d pay, and when they were in the middle of crossing the bridge
the verbeeg would lift the entire thing and tilt it towards himself, causing the
victim to slide back. “You promised, now pay up!”</p>

<p>A strong verbeeg leader might be able to form a gang with several of his
fellows, increasing the scale of their racket. Verbeegs also find it easy to
take control of nearby groups of ogres and even hill giants, since their
intellectual limitations make them easy to fool. A verbeeg band in charge of a
larger ogre or giant band can be a threat to their whole region.</p>

<p>Verbeegs aren’t very big on fighting, despite being giants. They’ll avoid it for
as long as possible, preferring to throw minions at the problem or to use
trickery to escape and misdirect. If a battle is unavoidable, they favor mobile
and stealthy tactics and combat styles.</p>

<p>Contrary to all expectations, verbeegs do have a code of honor they always
follow. It consists of two rules: 1) never give a sucker an even break and 2)
always keep your word. They can try to twist the wording of a promise quite far
and add all sorts of clauses before committing to it, but once they do they must
keep it.</p>

<p>I imagine you can make groups of non-hostile verbeegs with the same ease you
could make groups of other friendly giants. In that case, the description above
would apply to the ones you fight, not to the species as a whole.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Verbeegs are Large Fey Humanoids with the Giant keyword, even though their
origin has nothing to do with primordials or capital-G Giants. They have a Speed
of 8 and Low-Light Vision. Their signature trait is the hilarious <strong>Verbeeg
Stealth</strong>, which allows them to hide and use the Stealth rules as long as even
as single square they occupy counts as providing total cover or concealment.</p>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-verbeeg-elephant.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    It's surprisingly effective if you're not expecting it.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="verbeeg-rowdy">Verbeeg Rowdy</h3>

<p>The typical verbeeg ne’er-do-well, of the kind you can find operating alone or
in command of a gang of ogre patsies. In larger bands they make up the
rank-and-file. It’s a Level 9 Skirmisher with 99 HP. It wears hide, carries a
shield, and wields a Reach 2 <strong>spear</strong> in battle.</p>

<p>The spear can be used for basic attacks and for a <strong>Skewering Strike</strong> that
deals more damage and slides the target 5 squares to a position within 2 squares
of the verbeeg. Perfect for getting those pesky defenders out of the way. All of
these deal bonus damage if the rowdy has combat advantage against the target.</p>

<p>They can also use a <strong>Bounding Maneuver</strong> as an at-will move action, which
cancels any marks on them and allows them to shift 3 squares and to pass through
enemy spaces while doing so.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Cunning Trick</strong> minor action (recharge 5+) is a reach 3 attack vs. Will
that does no damage and knocks the target prone on a hit.</p>

<p>If a rowdy has to fight, it’s not gonna stay still, and it’s going to focus on
knocking people down and skewering them with its spear before bounding away to
safety.</p>

<h3 id="verbeeg-ringleader">Verbeeg Ringleader</h3>

<p>The sort of individual you might fight running a gang of other verbeegs and
dumber lackeys, and the one responsible for coming up with their verbeeg
plans. It’s Level 11 Artillery with the Leader tag and 91 HP.</p>

<p>Ringleaders are warlord-types and project an aura of <strong>Cunning Insight</strong> (5)
that gives bonus damage to an ally that has combat advantage against their
target. They carry <strong>Spears</strong> but prefer to stay away and use their
<strong>Longbows</strong>, whose basic attacks make the target grant combat advantage for a
turn. <strong>Distracting Shot</strong> (recharge 5+) and also gives an ally in reach a free
melee attack against the target.</p>

<p>Finally, the very flavorful <strong>Get Them!</strong> encounter power allows three allies
within 5 squares of the ringleader to make a charge attack for free.</p>

<h3 id="verbeeg-trickster">Verbeeg Trickster</h3>

<p>This one manage to score a spellbook or two and learn some combat magic. It’s a
Level 11 Controller with 115 HP. Their <strong>spear</strong> strikes knock the target prone
on a hit, and they have four spells:</p>

<p><strong>Staggering Bolt</strong> is a ranged attack that deals force damage and slides the
target 1 square; <strong>Blinding Blast</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fort, recharge 5+) deals
light radiant damage and blinds for a turn; <strong>Bewildering Bolt</strong> (encounter)
deals psychic damage and prevents the target from attacking (save ends); and
<strong>Concealing Mist</strong> (encounter) creates a zone of mist in a close burst 2. The
zone is lightly obscured, and gives any verbeeg that starts their turn inside
combat advantage against every enemy outside the zone.</p>

<p>Tricksters want to set their mist zone up and stay inside while they shoot at
the PCs outside it with their spells. Staggering bolt helps keep them outside,
and Bewildering Bolt is excellent to shut down controllers or ranged strikers
for a while. IF there’s a ringleader in the same encounter they’ll also want to
stay inside the mist.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Surprisingly personable and very big fey rascals. I wouldn’t want to make the
entire species fit the stereotype, but verbeeg bandits are a nice surprise to
spring on players who expect the giants plaguing the land to be dumb brutes
incapable of subtlety. Add 4 levels or so to the stat blocks present here and
you can upgrade their underlings from ogres to hill giants.</p>

<p>You can have lots of fun as a GM if you have your party fight a verbeeg bandit
gang on a series of hilltops crowned by standing stones. It’s both a very
fey-themed arena, and gives them plenty of hiding places. “These guys are ten
feet tall, how could they sneak up on us like that?!”</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>MM3 Umber Hulks are in a similar situation to a lot of other monsters in the
book. The Monster Vault would soon be released with an <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/01/20/umber-hulk.html">updated selection of
basic models</a>, and so this one features a trio of more niche variants.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As usual, the basic lore remains the same, but this entry adds some interesting
new details.</p>

<p>The first new bit is that umber hulks are one of the oldest species in the
world! The creatures are already mentioned in certain ancient records from
before the Dawn War, which makes some sages think they emerged from the raw
stuff of the world before the primordials had finished creating it.</p>

<p>The second is that their role as the world builders of the Underdark has a dark
side. Their tunnels may end up linking places that were best left isolated, like
two mutually hostile settlements. This is one of the reasons why underdark
civilizations tend to hunt them down. Some dwarves are also fond of chasing
umber hulks as they tunnel through the earth, for they commonly pass near veins
of precious metals.</p>

<p>Finally, these creatures are not a middle world exclusive! In ages past, small
populations of them found and walked through subterranean planar portals and
spread to places such as the Astral Sea or even the Abyss, and proceeded to
adapt to these new environments.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Umber Hulks are Magical Beasts and have a ground speed of 5 and a burrow speed
of 2 with Tunneling, which means their digging creates stable tunnels. They have
Darkvision and Tremorsense 5 as usual.</p>

<h3 id="umber-ravager">Umber Ravager</h3>

<p>This is a smaller and weaker relative of the basic umber hulk, so named because
it’s Medium and so it’s not technically a “hulk”. They wander closer to the
surface and are likely to be the first variant found by PCs who are not yet
powerful enough to brave the true Underdark.</p>

<p>The ravager is a Level 7 Brute with 95 HP. It can attack with a <strong>claw</strong> that
does light physical damage, and can be used in a <strong>claw flurry</strong> that allows it
to make two attack with a single action. Its most basic psionic power is a
<strong>Crushing Gaze</strong> (close blast 3 vs. Will) that deals light psychic damage and
knocks targets prone. Less often it can use a <strong>Disarming Gaze</strong> (ranged 3
vs. Will, recharge 6+) as a minor action that deals no damage but causes stun
(save ends).</p>

<p>Umber Ravagers hunt in packs, so you might see encounter groups featuring
several of them. Each one will target a different PC with its Disarming Gaze as
an opening move, and then focus its attacks on the stunned target. Yikes!</p>

<h3 id="abyssal-hulk">Abyssal Hulk</h3>

<p>This hulk’s ancestors managed to dig their way to the Abyss, and then suffered
mutations that allowed to survive there. Its bodily secretions became acidic,
and its psionic powers changed to be more madness-themed. It’s also smarter and
more consciously malevolent, with a Chaotic Evil alignment.</p>

<p>Abyssal Hulks are Level 15 Controllers with 152 HP. They fight up close with
Reach 2 <strong>claws</strong>, and with a <strong>Gaze of Chaos</strong> (close blast 3 vs. Will) that
deals light psychic damage and slides the targets 3 squares on a hit. After
sliding, the targets make a melee basic attack against a target of the monster’s
choice. It can also spray forth some <strong>Acidic Spew</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fort) to
inflict 10 ongoing acid damage (save ends) on those it hits.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the abyssal hulk can use a <strong>Gaze of Crushed Will</strong> (close
blast 5 vs. Will) to slide targets 3 squares and inflict a -5 penalty on any
saves they roll during this movement. You know when you roll a save during
forced movement? When someone uses it to push you off a cliff.</p>

<p>So yeah, this cruel mutated almost-demon wants to alternate pushing people off
cliffs with making them stab each other while singing “stop hitting
yourselves!”.</p>

<h3 id="astral-hulk">Astral Hulk</h3>

<p>Despite going to the realm of shiny light, Astral Hulks aren’t any less
unpleasant than their abyssal counterparts. There are signs that they may have
been engineered on purpose by some primordial for use as a weapon, because they
just love to dig into astral domains and tear them up until they become
free-floating debris fields. Several such domains were destroyed by astral
hulks, and the people of the Astral Sea are always on watch against astral hulk
infestations. Their gaze causes a pronounced lethargy on victims, and lures them
closer so the creature can use its natural weapons on them.</p>

<p>Astral Hulks are Level 17 Soldiers with 167 HP. Their <strong>Claws</strong> damage and mark
for a turn on a hit. If a marked enemy shifts, the hulk can use <strong>Entrapping
Mandibles</strong> on them as an interrupt, grabbing them on a hit. Their <strong>Gaze of
Lassitude</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude) deals untyped damage, pulls 4 squares,
and slows (save ends). Their <strong>Gaze of Annihilation</strong> (close blast 5
vs. Fortitude) is an encounter power that does untyped damage, half on a hit,
and marks everyone it hits for a turn.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>If you like umber hulks, you’ll find a use for these. I like that they’re all
very focused in their design intent. There’s one to introduce your players to
the monster earlier, and two to make them despair after they thought they had
left these things behind when they moved out of the middle world.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other.</p>

<p>This is the first time I’m seeing this monster. If they appeared in previous
editions, it was with a different lore.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, during the days of the Dawn War, there was a certain place in
the world that was a major nexus of primal power, connected to a great number of
spirits. This place was annihilated by one of the many cataclysms being thrown
around as weapons during that war. It was not the target - it was collateral
damage. And it was a god who pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The spirits of that sacred site were cast into the world, rootless and
homeless. Spirits of place without a place, their rage against the gods knew no
bounds. In order to survive, they cast part of their spiritual nature aside and
took on material forms made of flesh, becoming the first tulgars. And then they
swore to destroy the gods and their servants in revenge for what was done that
day.</p>

<p>The tulgars would soon find out that attaining their revenge was much harder
than they thought. After the Dawn War ended, the gods retreated to their domains
and no longer stepped into the world. Their followers very quickly grew in
number and built complex societies that were much harder to destroy than the
scattered fleeting villages of the War. Many of the tulgars gave up on their
oath over the ages, and now live as bitter mercenaries. Some of them, though,
still keep that flame of hate going and try to find ways to accomplish their
original goal.</p>

<p>Metaphysically, a tulgar is more or less the primal equivalent of a daeva or
rakshasa. When they die, they are immediately reincarnated elsewhere in the
world in a new adult body, with intact memories of their previous lives. I don’t
think they can reproduce by natural means, but they have been increasing their
numbers. They can sense when a primal spirit loses its home or becomes hateful
of sapient mortals or their gods, and converge to the spirit’s location to
convince it to join their numbers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Tulgars are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground Speed of 7 and the Forest
Walk trait. Their signature ability is <strong>Unbroken Spirit</strong>, which triggers when
they hit 0 HP and gives their nearest ally a “parting gift” of 10 temporary HP
and a +2 to attacks, defenses, and damage that lasts for a turn.</p>

<p>All the stat blocks here present us with early-epic threats, which is
appropriate for a people who swore vengeance on the gods and has a real shot at
achieving this. It’s possible they would make good allies for the Forsaken,
since they have similar goals.</p>

<h3 id="tulgar-flesh-hunter">Tulgar Flesh Hunter</h3>

<p>A hunter of sapient prey, with centuries of accumulated experience. This is a
Level 22 Skirmisher with 209 HP. It fights with a <strong>Spear</strong> and a <strong>Handaxe</strong> it
uses as a thrown weapon. Its <strong>On the Hunt</strong> trait makes it not provoke
opportunity attacks when it moves for a turn after hitting an enemy.</p>

<p>The flesh hunter can use <strong>Hunter’s Onslaught</strong> to make both a spear and a
handaxe attack against different targets on its turn. The ranged attack doesn’t
provoke opportunity attacks when used as part of this power, and the power can
be used in place of a basic attack during a charge! In other words, no reason to
use a single basic attack when this is available.</p>

<p>Additionally, flesh hunters can use a <strong>Rotting Strike</strong> (recharge 5+) to deal
light damage and inflict ongoing necrotic damage on the target (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="tulgar-savage">Tulgar Savage</h3>

<p>This unfortunately named enemy is a Level 22 Minion Brute. They have a <strong>spear</strong>
and a <strong>handaxe</strong> like the flesh hunter, though it does minion-scale
damage. Their <strong>Critical Threat</strong> ability allows them to crit on a 19-20, and
when they do they grant a free melee basic attack to an ally within 2 squares.</p>

<p>Oh, and they have Unbroken Spirit too, so they make a powerful contribution to
their allies by dying.</p>

<h3 id="tulgar-half-spirit">Tulgar Half-Spirit</h3>

<p>A tulgar that keeps more of its spirit side than most others. It’s a Level 23
Lurker with 116 HP, and it’s Insubstantial.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>Claw</strong> that deals minor necrotic damage and immobilizes
for a turn. It also turns the tulgar invisible for a turn as an effect. If it
hits someone who can’t see it, the half-spirit also dazes the target for a turn,
so there’s your lurker loop right there. It can also throw <strong>handaxes</strong> if no
one is at hand.</p>

<p>When the half-spirit becomes bloodied for the first time, it <strong>Unleashes the
Inner Spirit</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Fortitude), dealing necrotic damage and
stunning those it hits for a turn. The half-spirit then becomes invisible for a
turn and teleports 5 squares.</p>

<h3 id="tulgar-warrior">Tulgar Warrior</h3>

<p>This elite combatant doesn’t care about ranged attacks, and is all about
charging to melee and laying waste to armies. It’s a Level 23 Brute with 265
HP. Its <strong>Inveterate Warrior</strong> trait makes it crit on a 19-20, and deal 3d12
extra damage on a crit. That last bit might just be a codification of its
<strong>greataxe’s</strong> High Crit trait, since it’s not spelled out in this stat block.</p>

<p>The warrior’s basic axe attacks also inflict a -2 AC penalty for a turn. Its
<strong>Whirling Frenzy</strong> maneuver is an encounter power that allows it to attack
everyone in a Close Burst 1, shift 3 squares and repeat the burst attack once
more against anyone who wasn’t hit by the first one.</p>

<h3 id="tulgar-spirit-talker">Tulgar Spirit Talker</h3>

<p>Some tulgars retain a stronger connection to their former spirit nature and can
use that to cast spells. However, the other side of that connection is still
<em>broken</em>, and this slowly erodes their mental stability. Over time, a spirit
talker might become unable to live in its community, and the others consider it
a mercy to kill them so that their minds might be mended by the process of
reincarnation.</p>

<p>Spirit Talkers are Level 24 Controllers with 225 HP. They project a <strong>Primal
Barrier</strong> aura (2) that makes all spaces inside difficult terrain for creatures
without phasing or forest walk. It fights with a <strong>Spear</strong> whose attacks make
the target be marked by one of the tulgar’s allies within 10 squares. Its ranged
basic attack is the <strong>Incite Savagery</strong> spell, which deals psychic damage and
has an interesting rider. If the target doesn’t make a melee attack on its next
turn, it grants combat advantage until the end of its following turn. A great
power to use on primarily <em>ranged</em> attackers!</p>

<p>As a minor action the spirit talker can cast <strong>Dismissal</strong> (recharge 4+), which
targets a conjuration, summoned creature, or zone within 10 squares. It attacks
the Will of its creator, and on a hit it causes the target effect to end! If
there’s nothing to dispel, the spirit talker can use <strong>Call Spirit Warrior</strong> to
summon a tulgar minion to its side, acting right after it in initiative order.</p>

<p>Instead of Unbroken Spirit, the Spirit Talker has <strong>Death’s Embrace</strong>, which
works the same but makes its aura stick around as a zone with the same effects
until the end of the encounter.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like the lore of the tulgars here, because you can see how they might have a
reason for being bitter and angry. I’ll note that the stat blocks here are all
Unaligned, which means the book might agree with me. The only thing I dislike
here is the use of the word “savage” in both the minion’s name and the spirit
talker’s ranged attack.</p>

<p>You can play some tulgar groups as being vengeful against the gods and perhaps
leaning more towards Evil, but you can also portray them as people who gave up
on that vengeance but still can never go back to what they were, which is a very
different story. Maybe some of them might be looking for a way to become full
spirits again, and it might be something that brings them into alliance with the
PCs or with sympathetic NPCs.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Thri-Kreen got famous as one of the playable options for AD&amp;D’s Dark Sun. This
is their 4e debut. They would return as fully-supported playable characters in
the 4e Dark Sun Campaign Setting, about 3 months after the publication of the
MM3.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Thri-Kreen are mostly-humanoid sapient insects, adapted to live in arid
climes. They’re all over the Dark Sun setting, but even in this more generic
version their preferred habitats are deserts and arid wastelands.</p>

<p>Thri-Kreen tradition says they were created by the great primal spirit known to
them as Sand Father, and to other species as Old Grandfather. Sand Father looked
at the deserts of the world and found them too empty for his taste. So he
plucked a species of sand beetle from the world and made them into the first
thri-kreen. Realizing that size and strength would not be enough to guarantee
their survival, Sand Father also gave them the wisdom of the lizard and the
cunning of the desert fox.</p>

<p>In the distant past, the thri-keen managed to form a large empire that spanned
many of the world’s deserts, a nation known as Val-Karri. It lasted for a
hundred years before it was subjugated and assimilated by the dragonborn empire
of Arkhosia. The thri-kreen recovered their freedom when Arkhosia fell, and
returned to a nomadic lifestyle.</p>

<p>Modern-day thri-kreen regard people who live outside the desert as weak, for
only those tested by the sands are worthy of respect. Though they draw no maps
or formal borders of their desert territories, they guard those territories
fiercely and are quite harsh to interlopers who try to pass through without
paying homage to them first.</p>

<p>As long as these protocols are observed, thri-kreen are content to leave other
to their business and to go about their own. They’re very well adapted to their
chosen habitat and don’t need to raid neighbors for resources or anything like
that. Thri-kreen communities tend to be small and nomadic, and might go for
years without meeting other sapients. They display good aptitude for primal
magic and psionic powers, and are often good allies to any druids and wardens
that also make the desert their home. Thri-kreen villains are usually in service
to evil primal spirits, demons, or other groups who corrupt and transform the
land to suit their own foul purposes.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Thri-kreen are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 7 or 8 and
low-light vision. Their signature ability is the <strong>Mantis Jump</strong>, an encounter
power which allows it to jump a number of squares equal to its speed without
provoking opportunity attacks. Most stat blocks here combine martial training
with minor psionic powers.</p>

<h3 id="thri-kreen-ambusher">Thri-Kreen Ambusher</h3>

<p>These are young adults who spent their childhoods learning about the land and,
upon coming of age, are cast out of their tribe to survive alone for a
year. They travel widely to hone their skills, and their extended periods of
solitude also allow them to develop their latent psionic powers.</p>

<p>Ambushers are Level 6 Lurkers with 58 HP and a Speed of 8. They fight with two
<strong>spears</strong> in melee and with a <strong>Mind Stab</strong> power at range. The power deals
light psychic damage and dazes for a turn.</p>

<p>They can also use a <strong>Spinning Spears</strong> maneuver. This deals about half the
damage of a basic attack, but also gives them a +5 bonus to all defenses for a
turn and recharges their <strong>Psionic Boost</strong> ability. This one allows them to add
extra psychic damage to a Spear or Mind Stab attack after it hits.</p>

<p>So yeah, this is a lurker who doesn’t hide. It will alternate boosted Spear/Mind
Stab attacks with Spinning Spear. It’s still pretty good at hiding as well,
which is why it’s called an Ambusher.</p>

<h3 id="thri-kreen-scout">Thri-Kreen Scout</h3>

<p>Scouts keep watch over their territories and can stand still for hours under the
blazing sun while doing so. They warn the rest of the group when they spot an
intruder, and are cautious to engage them, preparing traps in advance. If a
direct fight starts, they’re frenetic combatants.</p>

<p>Scouts are Level 7 Skirmishers with 80 HP and Speed 8. They fight with
<strong>Spears</strong> and <strong>Shuriken</strong>, and can perform <strong>Leaping Attacks</strong> to move their
speed and make a stronger spear attack at any point during the move.</p>

<p>If hit by an attack, they can use <strong>Sudden Recoil</strong> to shift 1 square away as a
reaction. If the attack bloodies them, they can shift 4 squares instead. They
also have a <strong>Psionic Boost</strong> power similar to that of the Ambusher, though this
one recharges automatically on a 5+.</p>

<p>Scouts will alternate boosted basic attacks with Leaping Attacks, and will
probably have traps lying around the battlefield if they were expecting
company.</p>

<h3 id="thri-kreen-desert-talker">Thri-Kreen Desert Talker</h3>

<p>This is a primal spellcaster with powers over the desert sands. They tend to act
as judges in thri-kreen communities, trying those who break their laws and
customs and punishing the guilty. The most severe punishments are execution and
exile to the desert, but I imagine there are smaller ones for lesser offenses.</p>

<p>Sand Talkers fight with their bare <strong>claws</strong> and throw <strong>shurikens</strong>, but they
also have a couple of sand-bending spells for use in combat. <strong>Shifting Dune
Rend</strong> (area 1 within 10 vs. Reflex) deals no damage, but knocks prone on a hit
and slides 2 squares as an effect. <strong>Desert Tempest</strong> (close blast 5) deals
minor physical damage, pushes 2 squares, and blinds (save ends). It recharges
when the thri-kreen is bloodied.</p>

<p>All of this pushing around synergizes with <strong>Sand Trap</strong>, a minor action that
allows it to create three of the things within 10 squares. When an enemy starts
their turn in a sand trap square, they are restrained for a turn, and then the
sand trap disappears. The power recharges when there are no sand traps left in
the field.</p>

<p>Desert talkers are good for breaking up PC formations and setting things up for
their allies, which is exactly what they’ll spend the first few rounds
doing. Their special attacks do very little damage, but their basic ones are
okay and a good choice once all the PCs are good and restrained.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>I love thri-kreen! Whether they’re from Athas or not, I find their look
extremely interesting, and I also liked that this generic version of their
culture does not make them universally hostile.</p>
