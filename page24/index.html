<p>Thay is an island nation located somewhere outside of our regional map. It’s
ruled by wizards who like to wear red.</p>

<p>Now, if you’re only familiar with them from the Neverwinter Nights games, like I
am, you might have a somewhat ambiguous view of them. Sure, sometimes a Red
Wizard of Thay will be involved in evil schemes elsewhere in the world, but
#NotAllRedWizards are evil. There’s even a Lawful Neutral companion in NWN2: Mask
of the Betrayer who will praise the orderliness of her nation while helping you
save the world.</p>

<p>I’m here to tell you that this view is wrong. The Red Wizards of Thay are
basically Nazis. Their mechanical “thing” in 3e was that they overspecialized in
a single school of magic, but the edition change made the mask fall all the way
off and now nearly all of them pick Necromancy as their special school. So
they’re <em>necromantic</em> Nazis.</p>

<p>Thayan society values magic power above all else, so the Red Wizards are at the
top. The use of undead labor is widespread. Their rulers are a council of liches
led by one Szass Tam, one of those annoying epic villains the Forgotten Realms
are famous for. Most of the population thinks this state of things is
natural. Dissidents get zombified.</p>

<p>If you are a PC with the Renegade Red Wizard theme, you too grew up thinking all
of this was normal. You were pretty happy when your aptitude for magic was
discovered and you were admitted into one of the island’s prestigious Red Wizard
academies. You remained happy right up until your best friend made a tiny
mistake during a ritual, and your teacher was so enraged that he killed your
friend on the spot. Then he had the body brought in to be reanimated by your
class as a group project. You were completely horrified, but you looked around
you and saw that everyone else <em>still thought all of this was normal</em>.</p>

<p>You ran away the first chance you got, as fast as your feet could carry you, and
went as far as Neverwinter before you stopped and took stock of your
situation. You decided to stick around and help the reconstruction of the city.</p>

<p>And then you discovered the Thayans were <em>here</em>, doing something unspeakably
evil somewhere in the Neverwinter Wood. You’re done running. Time to do
something about these dang wizard Nazis.</p>

<p>This theme has no ancestry restriction, but its features only make sense for the
Essentials Wizard (also known as the Mage). The associated background skills are
Bluff, Heal, Religion, and Stealth. That seems like a lot, but it’s still
balanced because you still only get to pick one of them to boost or add to your
class list.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>This theme has no optional powers, but it makes up for that with extra
features. To understand how they work we must first know a bit about the
Essentials Wizard (known as the Mage from here on out).</p>

<p>Mages specialize in specific schools of magic as they level up. Heroes of
the Fallen Lands has three of them: Enchantment, Illusion and Evocation. Each
has an Apprentice, Expert, and Master feature, and a set of paragon-tier powers.</p>

<p>At levels 1 and 4 the mage chooses an Apprentice feature for two different
schools (one at each of those levels). At levels 5 and 8, they gain Expert
features for these same schools. At level 10, they gain the Master feature for a
single school and go on to pick paragon-tier powers for that same school as they
level up even further.</p>

<p>In olden times, Red Wizards were known for specializing in a single school to a
greater degree than most others. Nowadays, they always pick “necromancy”, but
the Renegade PC has used their basic teachings to pick something else. So one of
their magic schools is Enchantment, Illusion or Invocation like a normal mage,
but the other is replaced by the extra features of this theme. The other
features usually relate to your experience hiding from and fighting your former
compatriots.</p>

<p>Starting from level 1, every time you attack from hiding with an arcane power
and miss every target, you remain hidden. Enemies can still try to make
Perception checks to find you, but you’re no longer automatically revealed.</p>

<p>At level 4, you don’t get to make a second Apprentice choice. Instead, when one
of your spells causes a save-ends effect, the target has a -2 penalty on those
saves.</p>

<p>At level 5, you can switch one of your prepared spells at the end of a short
rest once per day, as long as its from your specialist school. Usually Mages can
switch spells only at the end of a long rest. Spell-switching is less of an
issue in 4e than it was earlier, in my experience, so this isn’t a very large
benefit.</p>

<p>At level 8, you don’t get your second Expert choice. Instead you gain a +2
bonus to Bluff and Intimidate. The bonus is untyped, which is the least they
could to do compensate for the lack of another Expert magic feature.</p>

<p>At level 10, you gain an extra +1 (untyped!) bonus to attack any Red Wizard or
undead creature that grants combat advantage to you. As a ranged controller, you
can’t get combat advantage quite as easily as a melee striker, but this is still
pretty nice. Several of your spells should inflict conditions that make enemies
grant CA.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Out of all these features, I think the level 4 one is the best. Since wizards
are controllers, a very large number of their powers are of the save-ends type,
so a -2 penalty to all enemy saves is huge. The attack bonus against all undead
is also pretty cool, but it comes in very late in the campaign.</p>

<p>If a non-Mage picked this theme, I’d rejigger is so they still get the Level 1
and 10 features as written, but get the printed Level 4 feature at level 5.</p>

<p>Now, about the story: As I mentioned previously, the Red Wizards are responsible
for the volcanic eruption that half-destroyed Neverwinter. Their original
intention was to <em>fully</em> destroy it and use the deaths to power the Super
Necromantic Fortress they were building in the Neverwinter Wood. A band of novel
protagonists foiled them 30 years ago, but now they have returned to the site of
the incomplete fortress to try and finish the process. This is what the Renegade
has found clues about.</p>

<p>Therefore, I would be inclined to include an NPC Renegade if the party has none,
just so they can point the PCs towards the Red Wizards. Punching them would as
satisfying as punching Hellknights and Nazis.</p>

<p>Delzoun was the ancient dwarven empire that flourished at around the same time
as the other ancient empires of the region. Being underground, it managed to
survive the fall of Netheril relatively unscathed and last a few more centuries.</p>

<p>They had several underground cities in the area, but their grand capital of
Gauntlgrym was the most majestic and famous. It started out as a mining
complex. Eventually its workers Delved Too Greedily and Too Deep, and found a
slumbering primordial: Maegera the Inferno.</p>

<p>Luck was on the dwarves’ side, and they managed to avoid waking Maegera up. Some
time later, Delzoun’s leadership would make a deal with the archmage who ruled
over the city of Illusk, founded by Netheril survivors. Combining their
technical and magical expertise, they built a geothermal power generator around
Maegera’s prison, using her as the heat source. This brought both civilizations
great prosperity, for a time.</p>

<p>Eventually, Illusk was razed and Gauntlgrym suffered the fate of all dwarven
fortresses, falling to an orcish invasion. Over the following years the orcs
would be displaced by humans, the humans by mind flayers, and then the city
would fall out of history and into myth. Today, Gauntlgrym is seen like a sort
of dwarven Atlantis - no dwarf alive knows where it was located, but many dream
of finding it and unearthing its riches.</p>

<p>A few years ago, though, an incredible event happened: a number of dwarves
throughout the world started receiving visitations from ghosts clad in the
ancient garb of Delzoun. The ghosts warned these distant descendants of theirs
that a great and terrible beast (spoiler: it’s Maegera) was about to awaken in
the site of ancient Gauntlgrym, and that this must not be allowed to pass. They
plead with these descendants to find the city and prevent the awakening. This
provoked a sort of “gold rush” to find the city, which died down after a few
more years of no one finding it.</p>

<p>The PC is one of the dwarves visited by the ghost of their ancestor, one who
hasn’t given up the search. They dream of finding their city, reclaiming their
ancient birthright, and elevating their family name to its rightful place among
their people’s legends. Oh, and of preventing the world-ending disaster that
would happen if this mysterious beast awakens. Strike the Earth!</p>

<p>There are no class prerequisites here, but as a true heir of Delzoun the PC must
be a dwarf. The associated background skills are Dungeoneering and History.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>These generally make you dwarfier than your typical dwarf.</p>

<p>Your starting feature makes you even more resistant to poison, granting you (5 +
half level) poison resistance.</p>

<p>At level 5, you gain an extra healing surge.</p>

<p>At level 10, you gain a +4 bonus to Diplomacy, Bluff and Intimidate when
interacting with other dwarves.</p>

<h2 id="optional-powers">Optional Powers</h2>

<p>These continue the theme of the features, making you tougher or more skilled in
dwarven lore.</p>

<p><strong>Scholar of Ancient Ways</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that lets you roll a
History check in place of any other INT-based skill check, or a Dungeoneering
check in place of any other WIS-based skill check. Because all things are like
dwarf fortresses if you look at them the right way.</p>

<p><strong>Noble Indomitability</strong> is a level 6 encounter power that works as an
interrupt. When you’re subject to forced movement, you can use it to spend a
healing surge and completely negate that movement.</p>

<p><strong>Body Over Mind</strong> is a level 10 encounter power that can be used when you fail
a saving throw. It lets you spend a healing surge to succeed at that throw
instead.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>These powers and features are excellent for all types of defenders, but they can
help a dwarf of any class become even more survivable. I know this is one of the
themes that locks you into a single ancestry, but it would be quite funny to
have a non-dwarf PC who is a true heir because they were adopted into a dwarven
family that can trace their line to Delzoun. If I was trying to make Carrot
Ironfoundersson as a 4e PC, I’d give him this theme.</p>

<p>Story-wise, this is probably the best way to involve your party in the search
for Gauntlgrym. It’s easy to justify multiple PCs having it, and you could build
a campaign around an all-Heir party.</p>

<p>This is the other half of the barbarian plotline!</p>

<p>The Gray Wolf are another Uthgardt tribe. They share a lot of the same base
culture, but also have several important differences. Namely, they’re
werewolves! The condition has been with them since they were Netherese refugees,
and by now it’s quite well-integrated into their culture. Until very recently,
they behaved like your typical Uthgardt tribe: violent, yes, but turning that
capacity for violence only towards those who invaded their territory.</p>

<p>This changed with the latest generation of leaders, which have been taking the
tribe in a more aggressive direction. They’ve become raiders, killing for
material gain and sometimes even for sport. This got worse when a bunch of
mysterious shadow-people approached those leaders and filled their heads with
dreams of glory and of becoming part of a reborn ancient empire. The Grey Wolf
have stopped fighting for themselves and have begun fighting for lost
Netheril. They’ve kind of become a neo-fascist gang.</p>

<p>A PC with this theme is a member of the Grey Wolves who took a stand against
this early in the process, and was exiled. Rumors have reached them that the
leaders of the Grey Wolves have switched to executing dissidents, and this has
driven the PC to act. Their goal is now to drive the shadows of Netheril from
the region and cleanse the tribe of their influence, getting them back on the
right track. They see the other PCs as a “temporary pack” that will help them
achieve this goal. Lone wolves are a myth, after all.</p>

<p>The Pack Outcast can belong to any class. The Gray Wolves also dislike arcane
magic, but there was no one around to prevent the outcast from learning it if
they so choose. Still, melee weapon users are going to benefit much more from
it.</p>

<p>Most Grey Wolves are either humans or shifters.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>You’re a werewolf!</p>

<p>At level 1, you gain <strong>Body of the Wolf</strong>. This is an at-will power that lets
you turn into a wolf (or back) with a minor action. When you transform, you can
also shift 1 square. The character retains their stats, and gains a +1 bonus to
Speed. All equipment melds into their form and provides its passive benefits
(unless it’s a shield). The character can’t use item powers or access
containers, but gains a wolf bite attack and becomes proficient with it. This
counts as a melee weapon with a +3 proficiency bonus, 1d8 base damage, and the
same magical enhancement as the character’s primary weapon.</p>

<p>This bite is <em>much</em> better than the one the Dead Rat Deserter gets at level 10!
Its main advantage is counting as a magical melee weapon instead of being a
specific power. This lets the PC use any of their weapon powers while in wolf
form, meaning anyone that relies on this type of power benefits from it. This
means all melee martials both from the PHBs and from Essentials material, as
well as characters like wardens, barbarians, paladins, and even the Warpriest
(Essentials cleric).</p>

<p>The bite is still useless for characters who rely on implements, and the book
doesn’t say anything specific about whether implements work while melded to the
animal form. A generous GM might interpret “You continue to gain the benefits of
the equipment you wear” to say that they do work, giving you a spellcasting
wolf.</p>

<p>Starting at level 5, enemies adjacent to you grant combat advantage to you and
to <em>all</em> allies who are also adjacent to those enemies. You don’t need to be in
a flanking position, any adjacent space will do. Also, you get CA even if you’re
the only PC adjacent to the enemy. This is super useful for melee combatants.</p>

<p>At level 10, you gain a +2 power bonus to Athletics and Intimidate, which is
kinda underwhelming after the two other skills but can still be useful.</p>

<h2 id="optional-powers">Optional Powers</h2>

<p>You can get even more werewolf-y!</p>

<p><strong>Bite of the Wolf</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that can be used when you hit
an enemy that grants combat advantage to you with a melee attack. This knocks
the enemy prone. Despite the name, you don’t need to be in wolf form to use
it. And remember that after level 5 every adjacent enemy will grant you CA.</p>

<p><strong>Blood of the Wolf</strong> is a level 6 daily power that can be activated with a
minor action and gives you regeneration equal to (1 + CON Mod) while you’re
bloodied. Like a werewolf’s regeneration, it shuts down for a turn if you’re
damaged by silver.</p>

<p><strong>Soul of the Wolf</strong> is a level 10 daily power that lets you assume a hybrid
form. You retain all of your equipment, armor and weapons, and can use them
normally. You also gain the same bite attack as in the level 1 power, temporary
HP equal to (10 + CON Mod), and a +2 power bonus to Speed, Fortitude, Athletics,
Intimidate, and damage!</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>If there’s a Dead Rat Deserter in the party, they’re going to spend most of
their time looking with envy at the Pack Outcast. This is a theme that greatly
boosts melee weapon users and has a spectacular level 10 power. Even if such a
character already has something equivalent to one of its features and powers,
they’re unlikely to have all of them, so there’s something here for
everyone. Plus, you get to say you’re a werewolf!</p>

<p>The Pack Outcast and the Uthgardt Barbarian are going to get along like a house
on fire, and having both in the same party will let you “speedrun” the first
couple of milestones of the barbarian investigation plotline. And just like that
other theme, this one can also be used for multiple PCs without any convoluted
explanations. An all-Pack Outcast game is a Werewolf: The Forsaken campaign
using 4e rules.</p>

<p>The Uthgardt are the barbarians of this Frozen North, more Conan-like than
Viking-like. They’re one of the many people descended from the citizens of the
human empire of Netheril, which scattered in a lot of different directions when
that empire fell overnight. The ancestors of the Uthgardt stayed in the region
when one of the Netherese flying islands fell here, and learned how to live off
the land. They take their name from Uthgar, a mythical ancestor who was so
badass he ascended to godhood and became one of the exarchs of Tempus, the FR
god of war. There are many Uthgardt tribes today, each one named after a
different kind of animal they admire and try to emulate. All of them venerate
Uthgar along with a series of tribe-specific primal spirits, and don’t pay much
attention to other gods.</p>

<p>A PC with this background belongs to the Thunderbeast tribe, who lives in the
High Forest way to the east of our regional map. A bit before the campaign
started, the tribe engaged in their annual custom of the Runemeet, when all of
them travel to their ancestral holy site to worship the spirits and perform
several important rites. The Thunderbeast’s site is a burial mound in
Neverwinter Wood, the resting place of one of Uthgar’s companions. The skeleton
of a great thunderbeast (which I guess is a type of dinosaur?) rests atop this
mound.</p>

<p>Or at least it used to. This year, the tribe found the mound dug up - whoever
did it carted off both the skeleton and the contents of the tomb beneath. The PC
was supposed to perform a sacred hunt as their coming-of-age ceremony, but the
elders decide to change their plans and charge the PC with a different quest:
find out who did this, make them pay, and restore the mound.</p>

<p>The tribe returns home, but the PC stays to await the return of the Grey Wolf
tribe, who lives nearby and who left for their own Runemeet elsewhere. They
should know who the desecrators are… and if it turns out <em>they</em> are the
desecrators, then the PC has another target for their hunt.</p>

<p>The Uthgardt disdain arcane magic, so most Uthgardt PCs will belong to martial,
divine, or primal classes. Still, there are no hard restrictions and you could
be a secret arcanist if you want added complications. The same goes for
characters who worship anyone other than Uthgar and the primal spirits.</p>

<p>Similarly, Thunderbeast Uthgardt are all human, and you need a good reason to be
something else (i.e, you or one of your parents was adopted into the tribe).</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>At Level 1, they gain the <strong>Thunderbeast Stomp</strong> encounter power. Stomping is a
minor action, and the resulting shockwaves act as an aura (2) that prevents
enemies inside from making opportunity attacks. It lasts for a turn, which is
enough to let the character run right past a defender line and charge the enemy
squishies.</p>

<p>At level 5, the PC gains a +4 to Perception checks made to find tracks, and a +4
to Insight when dealing with beasts and other Uthgardt. The bonuses are
specific, but also untyped, which is good.</p>

<p>At level 10, the character’s reputation as a barbarian hero gives them a +3
power bonus to Intimidate.</p>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>These powers center on communion with primal spirits.</p>

<p><strong>Spiritual Guidance</strong> is a level 2 daily power that lets the PC reroll a
Nature, Religion, or History check they dislike with a +5 bonus. The spirits of
the ancestors chime in to help you.</p>

<p><strong>Strength of the Beast</strong> is a level 6 daily power that gives the PC a +4 power
bonus to Athletics and Strength checks until the end of the encounter. Good for
skill challenges or feats of strength during combat.</p>

<p><strong>Spirit Swarm</strong> is a level 10 power that directly summons the PC’s ancestor
spirits to help in combat. This minor action creates a zone in a Close
Burst 2. Enemies inside the zone cannot regain HP or gain temporary HP. Allies
who enter or end their turns in the zone gain 5 temporary HP.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>This theme can make characters of any class feel like Barbarians, and any actual
Barbarians will be Barbarier-than-thou. There’s little to aid in combat here,
but the skill bonuses will go a long way in the appropriate campaign.</p>

<p>Looks like the typical Uthgardt has a hard time relating peacefully to people
outside their culture, so a PC in a mixed party is a somewhat atypical
individual by definition. Multiple PCs could easily take it in the same party
with the simple explanation that the tribe left behind a team instead of an
individual. A party where everyone has this theme would be extremely
uninterested in the fate of Neverwinter, and would single-mindedly pursue their
quest.</p>

<p>Okay, so back in Olden Times there was an elven empire named Illefarn that
reached as far as the North. Over the course of history this empire broke up
into three successor states. The one that covered our current region of interest
was named Iliyanbruen. This is important because if you get the two confused the
surviving eladrin of Iliyanbruen will tut-tut at you.</p>

<p>You see, when Netheril’s magic winked out, one of their floating islands fell on
the Neverwinter Wood. This was a disaster for both the humans living on the
island and the nation of Iliyanbruen that happened to be beneath it. Many of its
inhabitants decided to call it quits and move to Evermeet, which means more or
less leaving the world behind for good. Others decided to try and preserve their
culture, and enacted a ritual to move their capital city of Shandarar to the
Feywild.</p>

<p>Their new home was anything but safe, though, as a lot of the same beings who
had driven the original elves away from the Feywild at the dawn of time were
still there and they didn’t like the arrival of these invaders one bit. After a
period of strife, though, the elves managed to re-establish their nation there.</p>

<p>Iliyanbruen still exists in the modern day, its borders a ways away from the
place where Shandarar used to be. With the coming of the Spellplague, the world
and the Feywild began to enter in conjunction, which made the crossing once
again possible. After a lengthy battle to drive a covey of hags away from
Shandarar, the eladrin managed to send scouts and explorers though to the
world.</p>

<p>As a side note, I don’t know if the people of Iliyanbruen became eladrin after
millennia of living in the Feywild or if they were already a type of elf that
got recast as eladrin when the editions changed. We’ll be looking into some of
those later.</p>

<p>Anyway, upon arriving at the world, the eladrin of Iliyanbruen were horrified to
learn the old ruins of their empire were not only in a state of disrepair but
had also been looted and plundered. They were quite mad about it. You leave your
stuff lying around for a mere three thousand years and these uppity mortals
think they can come and take it. What an outrage!</p>

<p>The eladrin of New Shandarar began debating what to do and soon fell into two
distinct camps. One faction wants to invade the world in force and rain
vengeance upon anyone who lingers near the ruins of Iliyanbruen (i.e, everyone
in our regional map). The other also wants to restore the old cities to their
glory, but only wants to take revenge on the people directly responsible for the
thefts. This does require learning who these people are.</p>

<p>The PC is one of the investigators responsible for finding this out. They helped
retake Sharandar from the hags, were among the first to arrive on the world, and
decided to make it their home as they try to reconstruct the history of the
ruins and find the thieves. They belong to the moderate faction, and as the
campaign starts they’re getting desperate for results because the firebrands
back home are about to win the debate. They need concrete results, and fast, if
the world is to avoid an eladrin invasion.</p>

<p>Even worse, the main obstacle to their investigation isn’t the ludicrously large
time scale. No, it seems there’s someone out there actively trying to prevent
eladrin investigators from finding anything out, usually by murdering them. It’s
dangerous to go alone.</p>

<p>This theme is open to eladrin PCs of any class. Not all inhabitants of modern
Iliyanbruen are eladrin, but all of the features and powers here are aimed at
powering up their Fey Step.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>At level 1, PC can take one adjacent ally with them when they use Fey Step. The
ally also appears adjacent to the PC.</p>

<p>At level 5, they gain a +2 power bonus to History and Nature checks.</p>

<p>At level 10, they can use Fey Step as a minor action instead of a move
action.</p>

<h2 id="optional-powers">Optional Powers</h2>

<p>Most of these are yet more teleport-related power-ups.</p>

<p><strong>Blink Away</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that lets the PC teleport 2 squares
as a reaction to an enemy ending their turn adjacent to the PC.</p>

<p><strong>Evasive Step</strong> is a level 6 daily power that lets then use Fey Step as an
interrupt if an enemy attacks them while Fey Step is unexpended.</p>

<p><strong>Feywild Will</strong> is a level 10 daily power that gives the PC a +2 power bonus to
Will and to saving throws until the end of the encounter. Whenever the PC
succeeds at a save while this is active, they gain 5 + WIS Modifier temporary
HP.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Peeking ahead a bit I see Forgotten Realms’ Moon and Sun elves are eladrin
variants in 4e. I remember they were both huge assholes, so it’s not a surprise
the eladrin of Iliyanbruen are just as unpleasant even if they’re only their
distant relatives.</p>

<p>Most other PCs would be very interested in preventing an invasion from
Iliyanbruen from adding to their troubles, so they’re natural allies of the
moderate Guardian. And this is another one of those themes that easily supports
multiple PCs, or even a whole mono-theme party (it’s a <em>team</em> of
investigators). Such a party would be mostly uninterested in Neverwinter’s
political woes, except where they intersect with their quest.</p>

<p>If you want to optimize for the ability to do Teleport Shenanigans, this is the
theme for you. Little could stop a whole party of them from getting to where
they want to go. For other campaigns, it would also be relatively easy to strip
the standard Iliyanbruen backstory and just say a PC with this theme is a native
of the Feywild who moved to the world.</p>
