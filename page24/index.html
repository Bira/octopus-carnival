<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Remember how, way back in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/05/04/ape.html">“Ape”</a> entry, I commented that I wasn’t fond
of the “pulp fiction carnivorous gorilla” cliches some of them were leaning on?
Then you might imagine how I feel about this particular monster. I first saw
them in the 3e Monster Manual, but they might have appeared in a supplement for
an earlier edition.</p>

<p>A girallon is what happens when you take every single one of those cliches, lump
them together, and double the result. It’s an evil carnivorous gorilla that has
twice the size, twice the appetite for human flesh, and twice the number of arms
as the standard version of the trope. To complete the cliche bingo card,
girallons have white fur and are frequently worshipped as gods by “savage
jungle-dwelling tribes”. So yeah, not a great look so far.</p>

<p>Girallons are voracious carnivores and messy eaters that have the habit of
leaving viscera and entrails lying around their territories. They can climb and
move through the treetops with practiced ease, but their large size means they
need to sleep on the ground. Their lairs are usually in caves or ruins. Though
not sapient, some of them learn to make trails in their territory’s vegetation
that lead to prime ambush spots, which can act as an effective lure for sapient
prey.</p>

<p>Girallons are usually the most badass predators in their region. They’re either
solitary or organized in small bands, and do not willingly seek out allies of
other species. Still, they’re sometimes “tamed” by giants, trolls, fomorians and
other such sapients. Prospective girallon keepers must be either big and strong
enough to physically beat the creatures into submission, or have the knowledge
of magic necessary to keep them dominated.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<h3 id="girallon">Girallon</h3>

<p>The basic model and the template used for the others. This is a Large Natural
Beast and a Level 12 Brute with 145 HP. It has a ground speed of 8 and a climb
speed of 6. Its four arms act as a <strong>Threatening Claws</strong> aura (1) that makes all
enemies inside grant combat advantage, and a <strong>Combat Climber</strong> trait that make
it not provoke opportunity attacks when climbing.</p>

<p>The basic <strong>claw</strong> attack is Reach 2 and does the heavy damage expected of a
brute, and the <strong>Claw Flurry</strong> special (recharge 5+) allows it to make four
half-damage claw attacks.</p>

<h3 id="girallon-alpha">Girallon Alpha</h3>

<p>This specimen is much bigger and stronger than a typical girallon. It has all
the same traits as the basic model but is level 17 with 195 HP. It has two new
abilities as well.</p>

<p>The first is a positioning thing: <strong>Whirling Claws</strong> is a free action triggered
when an enemy starts its turn within 2 squares of the alpha. The alpha slides
that enemy 1 square, which is perfect for breaking flanking maneuvers.</p>

<p>The other is a special attack: <strong>Rend and Tear</strong> targets enemies in a Close
Blast 3, does heavy damage, and slides the targets 3 squares on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="infernal-girallon">Infernal Girallon</h3>

<p>A long time ago some devils decided infusing packs of girallons with the power
of Hell for use as bioweapons in the Blood War would be a swell idea. Now there
are packs of Infernal Girallons roaming and hunting through both the Elemental
Chaos and the Nine Hells.</p>

<p>These have all the same traits as a basic girallon but are Immortal instead of
Natural. They have the Devil keyword and Darkvision. They’re Level 22 Brutes
with 249 HP and all the same abilities as a basic girallon.</p>

<p>Their first new power is a trait named <strong>Burning Soul</strong>. This aura (2) causes 10
fire damage to enemies caught inside, or 20 if the girallon is bloodied. Better
give your defenders some protection from fire.</p>

<p>Their other new power is an attack named <strong>Burning Ichor</strong>, a Close Blast 3 that
does immediate and ongoing fire damage (save ends).</p>

<p>So yeah, an even bigger girallon that is on fire.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>You already know my opinion of their lore. I’m tempted to reskin these things
into demons or some other type of monster. I guess the exception is the lore for
Infernal Girallons. “Devils tried to do science, it did not go as planned” is a
good hook.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the Girallon is a basic paragon-tier brute, serviceable but not
spectacular. The enhanced versions add more interesting special attacks, so
depending on your needs you might want to down-level an alpha instead of using
the basic version.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Another entry that that adds extra stat blocks to complement the existing MM1
and upcoming Monster Vault monsters. This one is for hill giants.</p>

<p>The new lore here is minimal or restates things we saw elsewhere. Hill Giant
bands are usually small and consist of a single family group - they’re too
anti-social to form more complex organizations. Every once in a while a larger
group will manage to hold together for an extented period of time. Their leaders
style themselves kings, and the log fortresses they build are known as
steadings. You might have heard about a famous adventure with the words
“Steading”, “Hill Giant” and “King” in its title, wink wink.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As usual, Hill Giants are Large Natural Humanoids (Giants), with a basic speed
of 8. All of the ones here look like the iconic club-swinging D&amp;D giant, with
the big difference being in how they fight.</p>

<h3 id="hill-giant-smashers">Hill Giant Smashers</h3>

<p>A Smasher is pretty much a “Hill Giant Lite”. It’s slightly weaker than a
standard MV giant, and doesn’t throw rocks. To compensate, it’s more mobile and
has a few more tricks in melee. This is the stat block you use for those lone
mercenary giants that get hired as living tanks by smaller evil humanoids like
hobgoblins, bugbears, or gnolls.</p>

<p>Smashers are Level 11 Brutes with 137 HP. They have a passive <strong>Mobility</strong> trait
which allows them to roll saves against being slowed, immobilized, or restrained
at the start of their turns instead of at the end. This also works for any
save-ends effect that includes these conditions, like “ongoing 5 damage and
slowed (save ends both)”.</p>

<p>Like all giants in this entry they wield Reach 2 <strong>Greatclubs</strong>, and their basic
attack deals a bit of automatic splash damage to a secondary target on a
hit. Once per encounter they can perform a <strong>Whirling Crush</strong> to attack everyone
in a close burst 2, and they can also perform a <strong>Brutal Smash</strong> that deals
double damage and recharges on a miss. So they’ll keep trying that one until
they hit.</p>

<h3 id="hill-giant-rockthrower">Hill Giant Rockthrower</h3>

<p>The MM1 and MV give us an artillery giant that uses big javelins. But if you
want your giants to throw rocks and nothing but rocks, the Rockthrower is for
you.</p>

<p>Rockthrowers are Level 12 Artillery with 97 HP. As artillery monsters, their
<strong>Greatclub</strong> attacks are kinda weak, but their basic ranged attack is a
<strong>Knockdown Throw</strong> that does a bit more damage, pushes the target 2 squares,
and knocks them prone. They can also throw with a bit more force for a
<strong>Shattering Rockburst</strong> (recharge 5+), which deals damage in an area and dazes
on a hit.</p>

<p>They use the same tactics as a catapult: seek high ground, rain death from
above. I imagine hiring a bunch of rockthrowers is quite a bit cheaper than
maintaining your own siege engines.</p>

<h3 id="hill-giant-avalancher">Hill Giant Avalancher</h3>

<p>Avalanchers are the heroic prodigies of their people. They’re much smarter than
your typical hill giant, and often end up as leaders or kings. They get their
name from their clever rock-throwing tricks and from their brutal charges.</p>

<p>An Avalancher is a Level 14 Skirmisher with 139 HP. They can make basic
<strong>Greatclub</strong> attacks and perform <strong>Crushing Charges</strong> that do the same amount
of damage and knock targets prone. From a distance they can throw <strong>Rolling
Rocks</strong>, which in addition to doing damage on a hit slide the target 4 squares,
knock them prone, and gather no moss.</p>

<p>After they knocked a bunch of PCs prone, Avalanchers will move using <strong>Stomping
Shifts</strong>, which allow them to shift 4 squares and pass through prone enemies’
spaces. They deal an automatic 8 damage to a prone enemy when they pass through
their spaces.</p>

<p>Avalanchers will always try to use their Crushing Charge if possible, and will
make use of Stomping Shift to position themselves for a new charge and to deal
additional damage to prone enemies. They use Rolling Rocks to break up tricky PC
formations and to return fire against ranged attackers they can’t charge.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>It’s more hill giants, which it’s okay because I like hill giants. I like that
the Smasher is explicitly meant to be included as the “surprise bruiser” in a
lower-leveled humanoid group. A smasher and its humanoid employers work well as
a boss battle for a group of level 8-10 PCs, depending on how many other
monsters you add.</p>

<p>The Avalancher gives you an interesting option for a leader type who is not a
titan.</p>

<p>You know the drill by now - Frost Giants appeared in the MM1 and were about to
get rewritten with new math on the Monster Vault. The MM3 brings in an
assortment of them that can complement the “basic” entries in the MV. You can
look at those basic entries <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/04/frost-giants.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Frost giant lore remains the same. They’re plus-sized asshole vikings who like
to live in cold regions, fight with a variety of axes, and use lots of ice
magic. Some think this behavior is in service of a greater plan laid down by
their primordial masters, but that might be reaching a bit.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Frost Giants are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Cold and Giant
keywords. Their signature trait remains <strong>Icebound Footing</strong>, which reduces any
forced movement imposed on them by 2 squares and can reduce it to 0. They can
also roll a save to avoid being knocked prone. They have Resist 15 Cold, and
their ground speed is 8 with Ice Walk, which allows them to ignore ice or
snow-based difficult terrain.</p>

<h3 id="frost-giant-berserker">Frost Giant Berserker</h3>

<p>You’d expect someone with “Berserker” in its name to be a Brute, but these are
Level 16 Skirmishers with 157 HP. The book describes them as those hot-headed
youngsters who are too undisciplined to fight like proper brutes and instead
keep running around the battlefield.</p>

<p>They fight with <strong>Freezing Greataxes</strong>, which do a mix of physical and cold
damage. They can also make a <strong>Storm Charge</strong> that doesn’t provoke opportunity
attacks from its movement and deals heavy physical damage. Once per encounter,
the berserker can use its <strong>Primordial Rage</strong> to shift its speed and make three
basic attacks along the way, each against a different target. A bit more often
(recharge 4+) they can take a <strong>Giant Stride</strong> to shift 6 squares and move
through enemy spaces while doing so.</p>

<p>These giants are perfect for running right past the party’s defenders and
harassing their squishies. For extra annoyance, stage the fight in a map full of
ice-based difficult terrain, which doesn’t affect frost giants but makes it
harder for those defenders to reposition.</p>

<h3 id="frost-giant-shield-bearer">Frost Giant Shield Bearer</h3>

<p>Shield bearers are the opposite of berserkers. They’re the hardened veterans who
get the best gear and the best training. This makes them suitable to form the
core of a raiding party, or a lord’s honor guard. They’re huscarls.</p>

<p>Shield bearers are Level 18 Soldiers with 174 HP. They’re heavily armored and,
as the name implies, are just about the only frost giants who carry
shields. They still wield axes, though.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Coordinated Attack</strong> ability gives them combat advantage against any
enemy that has another shield bearer adjacent to them, no flanking
required. Their <strong>Icy Battleaxes</strong> do cold damage and mark for a turn. Once per
encounter they can enhance an attack and turn it into a <strong>Protective Strike</strong>,
which deals 10 extra cold damage and grants 25 temporary HP to an ally within 10
squares.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Defensive Stand</strong> allows them spend a minor action to choose an enemy
within 10 squares. If that enemy moves within reach before the end of the shield
bearer’s next turn, the shield bearer gets a free attack against that
enemy. It’s not an opportunity attack, so it should work with shifts or other
forms of movement too.</p>

<p>They’re all set up to fight in tight formations and hold ground, which means
they go well with artillery and ranged controllers.</p>

<h3 id="frost-giant-chieftain">Frost Giant Chieftain</h3>

<p>Any frost giant community not led by a titan will likely be led by one of
these. This chieftain is a Level 20 Controller with 190 HP. He has an
<strong>Emanating Cold</strong> aura (2) that makes enemies inside grant combat advantage to
cold creatures (i.e, frost giants and any monsters that are likely to tag along
with them).</p>

<p>The chieftain fights with an <strong>Icy Greataxe</strong> that does cold damage, and can
attack at range with a <strong>Eye of the Storm</strong> spell that does immediate and
ongoing cold damage in addition to slowing the target.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the chieftan can create a Medium or Large <strong>Pillar of Ice</strong>
within ten squares. The pillar lasts for a turn and “occupies” its space,
meaning no one can move through. It blocks line of sight and slows anyone who
starts their turn next to it.</p>

<p>The chieftain can also cast a spell named <strong>Grip of Winter</strong> that creates a zone
that slows and deals cold damage to those inside. The zone lasts for the whole
encounter and the power recharges once the chieftain is first bloodied.</p>

<p>Here’s your ranged controller to go with the shield bearers. Chieftains should
stay behind a line of their bodyguards, making the already difficult terrain of
the icy battlefield even worse with ice pillars and slowing attacks. Then you
release the berserkers to step over all that and hit the PC’s back ranks.</p>

<h3 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h3>

<p>I like giants in general, so I like these MM3 giant entries even though they
don’t include much new lore. The trio presented here has nice mechanical synergy
and should also be fun to use with the frost giants from the MV.</p>

<p>Like the ghouls we just covered, fire giants are classic monsters that appeared
both in the original Monster Manual, and who would appear again in the upcoming
Monster Vault. The MM3 gives a selection of fire giant stat blocks that
complements that of the MV.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The lore for fire giants remains pretty much the same as it was <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/06/fire-giants.html">in the
MM/MV</a>. The new bits here add that the ancient fire giant empire had close
contact with the efreets of the Elemental chaos, and that their many volcano
fortresses were linked to each other and to the City of Brass via teleportation
circles and portals. Most of these portals are deactivated in the present day,
though the giants labor to reignite them wherever they find one.</p>

<p>As usual, fire giants love to team up with other fire creatures, preferrably
ones they can dominate and command. Some of them end up in the service of more
powerful masters like efreets or the older red dragons, but since fire giants
always think they should be the ones in charge they make for untrustworthy
subordinates.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Fire Giants are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Giant keyword. They have a
ground speed of 8 and Resist 15 Fire.</p>

<h3 id="fire-giant-lavamaster">Fire Giant Lavamaster</h3>

<p>Here’s a name that looks like it came from the writer’s 8-year-old
child. Lavamasters are… masters of lava! Their magic allows them to control
magma and use it both as a weapon, and to heal their allies. Lavamasters are
Level 17 Controllers with 164 HP and the Leader tag.</p>

<p>They project an aura (2) of <strong>Hearthflames</strong> that hurts enemies and bolsters
allies. Enemies caught inside take 10 fire damage; bloodied allies recover 10 HP
when they start their turns inside the aura. This is not any kind of “drain”
effect. Allies recover HP regardless of whether there are enemies to damage or
not.</p>

<p>The lavamaster attacks with a <strong>Molten Sword</strong> that deals fire damage, and can
also use several spells. <strong>Magma Lash</strong> is a ranged attack that deals a bit more
fire damage than the sword, and pulls the target 4 squares. If the target ends
up adjacent to the lavamaster, the giant grabs them. The spell recharges when
the giant has no target grabbed. <strong>Magma Burst</strong> is like an at-will
mini-fireball that leaves a fiery zone in its affected area. The zone lasts for
a turn, counts as difficult terrain, and deals fire damage to enemies inside.</p>

<p>If the lavamaster has an enemy grabbed, <strong>Fiery Vendetta</strong> allows the lavamaster
itself or one of its allies to make a free attack against that enemy whenever
the enemy attacks the lavamaster.</p>

<p>A good tactic here is to keep away and repeatedly fireball the enemy, grabbing
anyone who gets too close. Keep a Brute or two nearby as bodyguards so they can
make free attacks against the grabbed victim and benefit from that healing aura.</p>

<h3 id="fire-giant-flamedancer">Fire Giant Flamedancer</h3>

<p>This martial artist is trained in an ancient style developed by the efreets. It
combines mobile spear fighting with fire-based teleportation magic. Flamedancers
are Level 18 Skirmishers with 174 HP.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Nimble Reaction</strong> trait gives them +4 to AC vs. Opportunity Attacks, and
their <strong>Whirling Spear</strong> basic attack deals fire damage and allows them to shift
2 squares on a hit. They can also make at-will <strong>double attacks</strong>, which must be
against different targets.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can make a <strong>Flameburst Leap</strong> as a move action,
teleporting 8 squares and dealing automatic fire damage to any enemies adjacent
to them at the starting point.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t expect a giant to be this agile! The same stat block can be used
for a slightly lower-level efreet without much issue.</p>

<h3 id="fire-giant-smokecaller">Fire Giant Smokecaller</h3>

<p>Smokecallers are what passes for a “subtle” fire giant spellcaster. They
surround themselves in clouds of volcanic smoke, and attack by turning that
smoke into a pyroclastic cloud aimed at their enemies. It’s “subtle” without
necessarily being “stealthy”, unless you’re already in an environment naturally
choked with sulphurous smoke. Which is… actually a common situation when
you’re fighting fire giants.</p>

<p>Smokecallers are Level 19 Lurkers with 140 HP and a nice speed of 10. They fight
with a <strong>Smoldering Whip</strong> that has a fantastic reach of 5. It targets Reflex,
does fire damage, and pulls up to 3 squares on a hit.</p>

<p>Its main tactic consists of two abilities: <strong>Smokecloud</strong> creates a zone of
smoke in a Close Burst 3 that lasts for a turn. It blocks line of sight for all
creatures except the smokecaller. While inside this zone, the smokecaller can
use <strong>Cindersmoke</strong> to attack all enemies in a Close Blast 5. This deals fire
damage on a hit, and it ends the smokecloud immediately.</p>

<p>Both are standard actions, which means the lurkery routine here is Smokecloud
followed by Cindersmoke on the next turn. Cindersmoke does the same damage as a
whip attack to each target. This means the whip is only worth it if its forced
movement component would synergize with something. An example is when you have
multiple smokecallers and one of them wants to pull a PC into its buddy’s
upcoming Cindersmoke area.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Like the ghoul entry, this one feels like it was designed to fit together with
the (upcoming, at the time) Monster Vault. The giants here all use the same
improved math as the ones that would appear on the MV, and they fill roles which
the more “classic” MV lineup does not. Combining the two gives you enough
ready-made stat blocks to make a dungeon inhabited solely by fire giants, though
you might also want to sprinkle in some hell hounds, elementals, and enslaved
azer that just need that final push to revolt.</p>

            <p>I dreamed about this thing today, and what use is a blog if I can’t use it to
write about the weird things I dream up?</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>This looks like a chunky, tabletop coffee machine of the sort that can be made
at TL8, and which might be found in an office. It’s self-contained, with
internal reservoirs for beans and plastic cups. An authorized technician
supposedly refills those after working hours, but employees who stay late never
see this technician, no matter how late they stay. And yet, the machine never
seems to run out.</p>

<p>The device bears the name of a company that does indeed make this type of
appliance, though instead of their usual logo it has an upside-down star with a
smiley face. It has no model name or other contact information printed anywhere
on its body.</p>

<p>The Coffee Machine From Hell has a counter-intuitive control panel. Several
button presses are required to tell it what you want, but that’s just bad
interface design. The Machine’s true curse is more insidious.</p>

<p>As its name implies, the Coffee Machine From Hell is literally a torment device
built by demons. It will do its nominal job of producing cups of shitty office
coffee, but only if the user is making one for themselves (i.e, being
self-serving) or is thinking hostile or hateful thoughts about the intended
recipient of the drink. Someone who’s genuinely trying to help, or even just
being neutral about it, will find the machine seizes up or behaves
unpredictably. Even if all buttons are pressed correctly, it will spit mangled
cups, spill hot liquid on the countertop, make the wrong drink, and generally go
out of its way to make user experience a nightmare and to never ever produce
whatever it is the third party ordered.</p>

<p>Placed in an office where “making a coffee for someone else” is an accepted part
of the culture, the Machine will soon turn it into a nest of hate and
resentment. This is accelerated if the “someone else” is always the
boss. Unlucky interns and employees will cause mess after mess until they start
to truly hate the boss. The boss, in turn, will be frustrated that no one else
seems to be able to operate this “simple” machine that always works for them and
will come to hate their underlings in turn.</p>

<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h2>

<p>Despite its shitty interface, no roll is required to operate the Machine. It
does however read the operator’s mind to see if it should trigger the curse, in
which case it behaves as if a critical failure had been rolled. This will either
result in a humiliating mess, or in a normal-looking but undrinkable cup of
coffee that’s sure to cause inflict a nasty surprise on its intended recipient.</p>

<p>Someone who is wise to the curse can try to trick the device into operating
normally with a successful <strong>Mind Block</strong> roll, or through any powers they have
that can shield their thoughts from telepathy. This roll can me made at the
usual <strong>Will-5</strong> default if the character lacks the skill.</p>

<p>The machine’s infernal nature can be detected by any power or spell that detects
evil or infernal powers. It can be “cleansed” through <strong>Exorcism</strong> or equivalent
powers, like a more typical cursed artifact. Its greatest defense against
detection and exorcism is that neither of these abilities are common in the
settings in which it appears. Its true nature can’t be detected by purely
scientific means.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it-in-a-game">How to use it in a game</h2>

<p>The Coffee Machine From Hell is a perfect addition to any oppressive office your
PCs must infiltrate for a while, particularly if they’re undercover as
interns. It’s something of a trap in that case: If everyone else already hates
each others’ guts, the PCs will be the only ones who trigger the curse, and this
will draw undue attention to them.</p>

<p>Obviously, every office <em>in</em> Hell has one of these, but it can also be present
on Earthly companies under demonic influence, or just wind up in an otherwise
normal company without any explanation.</p>

<p>PCs on an infiltration mission will most likely need to trick the
machine. Exorcism attempts are too obvious and will likely blow their cover,
especially if they are actually infiltrating Hell. In an infiltration scenario
where the office is weird or evil in other ways, the machine is unlikely to be
the only obstacle they face.</p>

<p>In a campaign centered on paranormal investigation or monster hunting, the PCs
might be hired to find the problem behind a supernaturally toxic work
environment. If they have supernatural means of detecting evil, they’ll be able
to easily find the Machine, but in those cases it might be only one of the
sources of trouble. If they must rely only scientific instruments, then finding
the Machine is considerably harder even if they can easily use Exorcism to
cleanse it.</p>
