            <p>I think Goliaths first appeared in the Races of Stone supplement for 3.5. In
Fourth Edition, their first appearance was as a playable option in the
PHB 2. They get their corresponding “monster” entry here, with a couple of stat
blocks suitable for use as opposition or NPC allies.</p>

<p>They’re one of the many playable peoples designed to give players a “taste” of
being a cool fantasy monster without being unbalanced. Eladrin arguably do it
for Sidhe; dragonborn do it for dragons; tieflings for fiends; deva for
angels. Goliaths do it for giants.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-goliath.png"/>

<p>The typical goliath is stated to be between 7 and 8 feet tall, so whether
they’re on the large side of Medium or the small side of Large is a matter of
opinion. The book’s opinion is that they’re Medium, since that allows them to be
playable. Their skin is gray or brown, and speckled with coin-sized bony growths
that look like rocks.</p>

<p>Goliaths have existed since shortly after the Primordials created the world,
which might mean they’re a kind of byproduct of the creation of the Giants in
the same way the origin of the Dragonborn is tied to that of dragons. Goliaths
don’t care enough about that to make myths about it, though.</p>

<p>All throughout their history they’ve preferred to keep to a nomadic existence in
the more mountainous areas of the world, so there isn’t much about them in other
people’s records either. While it’s fairly common for individual goliaths to
travel the “lowlands” as adventurers or explorers, they haven’t engaged in any
grand diplomacy or empire-building as a people.</p>

<p>Culturally, goliaths place a lot of value in individual skill and prowess, and
this makes them very competitive. Their communities probably have all sorts of
tournaments and contests in their calendars. Individual goliaths tend to turn
everything into a contest, even if only in the privacy of their own minds - they
keep score and constantly compare themselves both to their companions and to
their own past performance. That battle where Legolas and Gimli compare their
kill counts? That’s every fight where a goliath is involved. This does have the
downside of making them get a bit depressive when they fail to measure up to
their own standards.</p>

<p>I suspect Kord is a very popular deity among goliaths, and they also often
worship the primal spirits.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As far as the rules are concerned, Goliaths are Medium Natural Humanoids. They
have a natural speed of 6, and human-equivalent senses. Their signature ability
is <strong>Stone’s Endurance</strong>, a minor-action encounter power which gives them
some resistance to all damage for a turn. The value of this resistance is 5/tier
(5 at heroic, 10 at paragon, 15 at epic).</p>

<h3 id="goliath-sunspeaker">Goliath Sunspeaker</h3>

<p>This is more of a primal priest of the sun spirits than a cleric of Pelor,
focused on burning people with sun-powered lasers. Sunspeakers are Level 7
Artillery with 64 HP, wearing light armor and using an orb as an implement.</p>

<p>Their melee basic attack is the <strong>Sunspeaker’s Hand</strong>, which targets Reflex and
deals light radiant damage. <strong>Solar Sphere</strong> does the same at Range 20 with
better damage.</p>

<p>Less often, the sunspeaker can use <strong>Solar Rays</strong> (recharge 4+) against up to 2
targets within Range 10. This deals light radiant <em>or</em> fire damage, as well as
ongoing damage of the type chosen (save ends). This allows them to potentially
stack two sources of ongoing damage on someone with the same power.</p>

<p>If cornered, the sunspeaker can use <strong>Flaring Leap</strong> (move action; encounter) to
jump 3 squares and then move its remaining speed. This jet-powered jump causes a
fire in the sunspeaker’s starting space, which deals damage to adjacent enemies
or to those foolish enough to enter the flaming square. The fire lasts for a
turn and can be sustained with minor actions.</p>

<p>Finally, it can use a big area attack named <strong>Call Down The Sun</strong> once per
encounter, which is a bit weaker than Solar Sphere but targets a lot of people
and does half damage on a miss.</p>

<h3 id="goliath-guardian">Goliath Guardian</h3>

<p>A more straightforward but no less powerful martial type. The guardian is a
Level 9 Soldier with 96 HP. It’s heavily armored by still has speed 6, wielding
a bastard sword and a light shield.</p>

<p>Its basic <strong>sword</strong> attack marks for a turn, and if the target is prone it’s
also prevented from getting up for the same amount of time. The guardian knocks
people prone with <strong>Ram’s Charge</strong> (recharge 5+), a maneuver that deals light
physical damage and has a long list of riders: it pushes the target 2 squares,
knocks it prone, and allows the goliath to make a free sword attack against the
target. As the name says, it can be used as part of a charge.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Warrior’s Leap</strong> is a passive that allows the guardian to jump
without provoking opportunity attacks. It still uses the standard jump rules
(and it’s high Athletics score) for that.</p>

<p>Guardians are awesome in moutainous terrain that’s full of cliffs. Even if their
targets aren’t thrown overboard, they’ll still stay on the ground for quite a
while, granting advantage to the guardian and any sneak-attacking skirmisher
buddies.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Goliaths often team up with similarly-inclined mountain-dwellers, which can
include dwarves, galeb duhrs, or goblins. I suppose that might include stone
giants as well, if you level your goliaths up a bit. The sample encounter is
level 9, and includes a galeb duhr rock-caller, 3 goliath guardians, and 1
sunspeaker.</p>

<p>I like goliaths, they fill a very specific “huge person” niche. These two stat
blocks are interesting from a mechanics standpoint as well.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Golems showed up in the first MM and were iconic enough to later make it to the
Monster Vault. I covered those <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/30/golem.html">here</a>, and you can check that same post to
see their basic lore. The Monster Manual 2 brings us yet more golems, which
share the same basic lore.</p>

<p>As before, golems are Natural Animates with the Construct keyword. They’re
immune to disease, poison, and sleep. They have darkvision, and though their
ground speed tends to be high they cannot shift. Most are Large, but one of the
examples here is Huge.</p>

<h2 id="bone-golem">Bone Golem</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-golem-bone.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Bone golems are made from the skeletons of several creatures, whose bones are
sharpened and fitted together to form the construct’s body. Despite being made
of bones and beloved of necromancers, it’s a construct animated through
elemental magic and not an undead monster. Throw this one into an encounter that
does have undead skeletons in it, and it should be good to surprise your PCs a
bit.</p>

<p>Bone Golems are Level 12 Elite Brutes with 302 HP. It’s so spiky the pointy bits
count as a <strong>Bone Spikes</strong> aura (1) that deals 5 damage to any enemy that enters
it. The pointy bits also justify the <strong>Osseous Retaliation</strong> trait, which deals
a bit of automatic damage to anyone who hits the golem with an opportunity
attack.</p>

<p>This construct fights with Reach 2 <strong>Bone Spurs</strong>, and can attack twice per
action with them. It can also fire a <strong>Bone Volley</strong> (burst 3 vs. Reflex,
recharge 6+) that deals heavy physical damage and dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>When the golem is destroyed <strong>Bone Death</strong> allows it to make one last
attack. If Bone Spurs is charged then it uses that, otherwise it makes a basic
bone spur attack.</p>

<h2 id="chain-golem">Chain Golem</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-golem-chain.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These Huge golems are modeled after chain devils, and are often tasked to guard
prisons and Actual Dungeons instead of the usual tombs or treasure vaults. As
you might have guessed, their fighting style is very grapple-intensive.</p>

<p>Chain Golems are Level 22 Elite Soldiers with 418 HP, a speed of 8, and all
standard golem traits. Their <strong>Entangling Chains</strong> act as an aura (3) that slows
everyone caught inside.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 3 <strong>Chain</strong> that does physical damage and pulls
the target 2 squares. <strong>Chain Smash</strong> is their double attack power, allowing it
to attack two different targets in one action. While they’re bloodied, <strong>Berserk
Attack</strong> allows them to make a chain strike against anyone who damages them as a
reaction.</p>

<p>All that and we didn’t even use the grappling rules yet! We have to do that for
<strong>Chain Grab</strong>, though. This at-will attack is a Close Burst 2 that does the
same damage as the basic strike, pulls targets 1 square, and grabs them. The
escape DC is 32 or 35 depending on the skill you use. The golem can move away
from the grabbed victims without ending the grab because chains. Once it
finishes moving it can either slide the victims next to itself or let them go.</p>

<p>So your typical chain golem will try to keep the whole party grabbed while it
smacks them around with its chains. PCs who aren’t grabbed will still be slowed,
and the golem’s strikes will pull them back if they try to run away. Staying far
away and using ranged attacks is a good tactic against them, but that speed of 8
will make keeping away a real chore.</p>

<h2 id="clay-golem">Clay Golem</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-golem-clay.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Clay Golems were one of the original golem types described in the first entries
back in AD&amp;D or in the nebulous times before it. They were originally inspired
by the legend of the golem of Prague, and so were the only golem that required
divine magic to make (all the others were arcane).</p>

<p>In Fourth Edition, <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/12/eidolon.html">eidolons</a> are used to represent divine constructs, so
clay golems have the same arcane/elemental origin as the other types. They have
a somewhat “runny” appearance, but are surprisingly fast and retain a slightly
less harsh version of the ability to inflict unhealing wounds that they had in
previous incarnations.</p>

<p>Stat-wise, they’re Level 15 Elite Brutes with 368 HP, Large size, a speed of 6,
and all common golem traits. Their basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Slam</strong> that does
heavy physical damage and curses the target, making it unable to regain HP. This
is a (save ends) condition, but it’s still quite dangerous, since it makes
wounds inflicted by <em>all</em> enemies unhealing, not just the golem’s. <strong>Clay
Smash</strong> allows it to slam two different targets in one action, and they have the
same Berserk Attack reaction as the chain golem above.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Hasty Reaction</strong> passive trait allows them to roll initiative twice and
take the highest result, and <strong>Unstoppable</strong> is a move-action encounter power
that allows them to move 8 squares and pass through enemy spaces. They draw
opportunity attacks when doing this, but reduce their damage by 10. This isn’t
worded like a resistance, so I guess powers that bypass or reduce resistances
don’t work against it.</p>

<h2 id="iron-golem">Iron Golem</h2>

<p>These made it into the MV, so we already covered them. The MM2 has two versions,
the Level 20 one that we saw, and a Level 26 “Iron Golem Juggernaut” that’s
basically the same aside from being size Huge and having bigger numbers.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Each kind of golem presented here gets a sample encounter. I guess there was
something of an editing snafu here, because most golems have their encounter
listed right after their stats, but the one for chain golems is all by its
lonesome in an “Encounter Groups” section at the end of the overall entry. I
guess it must be there because it has two golem types in it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 1 bone golem, 4 horde ghouls (minions), 1 human wizard lich. So
that’s the kind of caster who makes bone golems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 1 clay golem, 1 shadar-kai gloom lord, 2 shadow snakes. A Zehiri
operation, if you still want to associate clay golems with clerics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 21: 1 chain golem, 1 dark naga, 1 iron golem. Someone <em>really</em> wanted
this place guarded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 24: 1 iron golem juggernaut, 1 storm gorgon, 1 djinn skylord. A noble,
his pet, and his mechanical manservant.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a point past which adding more golem types feels a bit redundant. There
are also so many non-golem constructs out there that I almost think “golem”
should be a singular monster type with very specific characteristics, rather
than a whole family of them. Otherwise it would be best to do away with the term
entirely.</p>

<p>D&amp;D Fourth Edition uses “Goblins” to describe a set of closely related species
of humanoids: actual goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. They’re a very
traditional component of the game and we looked at lots of them in the
MM1/Monster Vault Let’s Read. The post covering their basic lore is <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/22/goblinoids.md">here</a>.</p>

<p>Since the first Manual covered them so well, the second brings us a small number
of more specialized stat blocks for them.</p>

<h2 id="bugbear-wardancer">Bugbear Wardancer</h2>

<p>Wardancers are specialized martial artists. Their weapon of choice is a
two-handed heavy flail, which they swing in wide arcs while moving through enemy
forces in the battlefield. The end result looks something like a dance, thus the
name. There’s a religious element to the art: there are different schools
organized around the worship of different exarchs of Bane, who compete among
each other to see whose war dance is the best.</p>

<p>The wardancer presented here is a Level 6 Skirmisher with 70 HP, low-light
vision, and Speed 7. Its basic attack is a <strong>Flail Dance</strong> that does physical
damage and has a lot of stacked riders: it pushes the target 2 square and knocks
it prone, and also allows the bugbear to shift 1 square. Yes, this is an at-will
basic attack.</p>

<p>The wardancer also has a couple of special attacks. <strong>Flail Barrier</strong> (recharge
5+) does a bit of automatic damage in a burst 2 around the bugbear, and makes it
take half damage from weapon attacks until the end of its next turn. <strong>Flail
Assault</strong> (close burst 2 vs Reflex; encounter) does a bit more damage and knocks
those it hits prone.</p>

<p>All the wardancer’s attacks deal extra damage if it has combat advantage against
the target.</p>

<h2 id="goblin-acolyte-of-maglubyet">Goblin Acolyte of Maglubyet</h2>

<p>Another martial artist, this one a goblin from a sect devoted to Maglubyet. In
previous editions (and again on 5th), Maglubyet is the main goblinoid deity, but
here he’s one of Bane’s Exarchs. His acolytes seek to make themselves in his
image.</p>

<p>The Acolyte is a Level 1 Controller with 29 HP, Speed 6, and low-light
vision. They wield a battleaxe in combat, and back it up with a bit of divine
magic.</p>

<p>Acolytes are surrounded by a <strong>Life Scourge</strong> aura (2) that prevents enemies
inside from recovering hit points. Their basic attack is a <strong>Slashing Shroud</strong>
that consists of an axe strike that also makes the acolyte invisible to the
target until the end if the acolyte’s next turn. A good option against PC
defenders.</p>

<p>They can attack at range with the <strong>Hand of Maglubyet</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Fortitude), a telekinetic attack that deals force damage and either slides
the target 3 squares or immobilizes it for a turn. <strong>Maglubyet’s Fists</strong>
(recharge 5+) allows them to use this attack twice in a single action. So as far
as martial artists go, this is one of those annoying hadouken spammers.</p>

<p>The acolyte also has the standard <strong>Goblin Tactics</strong> power that allows it to
shift 1 square as a reaction when missed by a melee attack. This is what you
would change if you were making acolytes of other species.</p>

<h2 id="lolthbound-goblin">Lolthbound Goblin</h2>

<p>Goblins are generally big on Bane worship, but that’s not universal among
them. This is a goblin whose people have been slaves to the drow for
generations. Their training, and even their physiology, have some important
differences from your usual goblins. They’re clearly meant to be encountered
alongside drow, though for that to work out you’ll need to make those drow lower
level or the goblin higher level.</p>

<p>As written, the Lolthbound Goblin is a Level 3 Soldier with 45 HP. They have
speed 6, and replace the usual low-light vision with full darkvision. They wear
light armor and fight with a war pick.</p>

<p>When Lolthbound Goblins are within 5 squares of a drow, they gain a +2 bonus to
all their attacks and defenses. That <strong>pick</strong> is a high-crit weapon and marks
targets for a turn on a hit. Once per encounter they can use a <strong>Stinging Blow</strong>
that deals poison damage and instead of marking increases any ongoing poison
damage the target is taking by 5. This synergizes with the poisoned weapons drow
so often carry.</p>

<p>Also once per encounter they can use a <strong>Lolthbound Shriek</strong> (close blast 5
vs. Fortitude), which deals light thunder damage to anyone in the area who is
not a drow or spider.</p>

<p>Aside from the usual Goblin Tactics reaction, they also have <strong>Drow Protector</strong>,
an interrupt where the goblin throws himself in front of a drow that’s just been
targetted by an attack, becoming the target instead.</p>

<h2 id="lolthbound-goblin-slave">Lolthbound Goblin Slave</h2>

<p>This is a Level 12 Minion Skirmisher version of the lolthbound goblin above,
which makes it appropriate for use with drow without the need for level
adjustments. They’re also armed with war picks, and add a hand crossbow to their
loadout.</p>

<p>Their basic melee attack is a <strong>Stinging Pick</strong>, which works just like the
Stinging Blow from the regular version. Their basic <strong>crossbow</strong> attack deals a
bit more damage if they’ve moved 3 or more squares before making it.</p>

<p>They also gain the attack and defense bonus from being near drow, and have
Goblin Tactics.</p>

<h2 id="hobgoblin-fleshcarver">Hobgoblin Fleshcarver</h2>

<p>This is the hobgoblin specialized martial artist. Unlike the bugbear and goblin
examples, fleshcarvers don’t seem to have a religious component to their
training. It’s all about hard work and crafting your own custom-fitted
weapons. Their weapons of choice are a polearm and a set of poisoned throwing
darts, whose poison is harvested from serpents they hunt as part of their
training. Fleshcarvers never refuse a challenge to combat, though they’re smart
enough to not let such a challenge distract them in the middle of an ongoing
battle.</p>

<p>Fleshcarvers are Level 6 Elite Controllers with 146 HP. They have Speed 6 and
low-light vision, wear heavy armor, and are armed with the afore-mentioned
specialized weapons.</p>

<p>Their stance and movements act as an aura (2) named <strong>Fleshcarver’s Trap</strong>,
dealing 5 damage to any enemy inside the first time they move during their
turn. Their <strong>glaive</strong> is reach 2 and is used both for basic attacks and for an
at-will <strong>Glaive Flurry</strong> that targets all enemies in a close burst 2, does more
damage than the basic attack, and slides targets 2 squares.</p>

<p>At range they can throw those <strong>Toxic Darts</strong> to do a bit of poison damage and
slow the target (save ends). If the target was already slowed, it’s immobilized
instead. When they’re hit by a melee attack, they can use their reaction to
shift 2 squares and make a dart attack. And finally, fleshcarvers have the same
Hobgoblin Resilience and Phalanx Soldier powers from MM1 hobgoblins.</p>

<p>These hobgoblins are more effective when lots of enemies are in reach, but the
selective targetting on their area attack means they engage all those enemies
while fighting in formation for that sweet defense bonus from Phanlanx Soldier.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>These new goblinoid specialists can be inserted into any goblin encounter, and
being goblins themselves also work well with any of their typically allied
creatures. These are the encounters we get on the book:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 1: 1 goblin acolyte, 3 goblin warriors, 1 Lolthbound Goblin. It’s likely
the whole group are drow slaves, with the LBG being their leader. The level
math works out, but the LBG’s drow-related skills are wasted here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 2 bugbear wardancers, 2 bugbear warriors, 1 barghest battle lord. A
warlord and their bodyguards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 1 fleshcarver, 3 hobgoblin soldiers, 2 dire wolves. A patrol with a
little extra kick to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 4 lolthbound goblin slaves, 1 drow priest, 2 blade spiders, 2 drow
warriors. Lots of poison being thrown around on this one, which makes the
minions more dangerous than their level would indicate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like these new additions, because their stat blocks are interesting and their
associated lore fleshes goblin culture out a bit more. I like that they’re
complex enough to have multiple martial styles.</p>

            <p>Gnomes were introduced in the first Monster Manual, and you can see the post I
did on them <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/21/gnome.html.">here</a>. By the time the MM2 came out, they were already available
as a playable option in the Player’s Handbook 2.</p>

<p>We get three new gnome stat blocks in this entry, but one of them (the Gnome
Entropist) also appeared in the Monster Vault and so was covered in the original
post. We’ll cover the other two here.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-mistwalker">Gnome Mistwalker</h2>

<p>Gnome Mistwalkers are like the triple-classed fighter/illusionist/thieves of
yore. They’re skilled at illusion magic and melee combat, using those to ambush
their targets. This sort of training is common among gnome brigands, who build
elaborately disguised hideouts and strike at merchants passing along nearby
trade routes.</p>

<p>Mistwalkers are Level 5 Lurkers with 51 HP and all standard gnome traits
(including the Fade Away and Reactive Stealth powers described in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/21/gnome.html.">original
post</a>). They wear light armor and wield picks in combat.</p>

<p>The <strong>picks</strong> have the High-Crit property, and they deal extra damage to targets
granting them combat advantage. <strong>Mistwalker’s Strike</strong> (recharge 4+) allows
them to become invisible until the end of their next turn, shift 2 squares, and
make a pick attack in that order. This means the attack will always benefit from
the extra damage, and won’t disrupt the invisibility.</p>

<p>In addition to the two standard powers, they have a third defensive ability in
the form of <strong>Blur of Movement</strong>, a reaction that allows them to teleport 1
square when hit by an enemy.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-entropist">Gnome Entropist</h2>

<p>Their mechanics were covered in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/21/gnome.html.">original post</a>, but here we get a bit of
extra lore on them. Entropists are magicians whose power flows from the
Elemental Chaos. This tends to interfere with their natural link to the Feywild,
so they’re not usually the most stable of gnomes.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-wolverine">Gnome Wolverine</h2>

<p>This gnome is the best at what it does, and what it does ain’t pretty, bub. And
that’s pretty much all you need to know to understand this short berserker.</p>

<p>Wolverine is a Level 9 Skirmisher with 95 HP, lightly armored and wielding an
axe. His natural speed of 5 becomes 7 on a charge, and he has a +3 to AC against
opportunity attacks plus the standard gnome powers.</p>

<p>That <strong>axe</strong> can be used for basic strikes and for an <strong>Unbalancing Swipe</strong> that
does the same damage, slides the target 2 squares on a hit and knocks then prone
on a critical. When the Wolverine drops an enemy to 0 HP, <strong>Vicious Fury</strong>
allows him to shift 5 squares and gain a +3 bonus to damage rolls until the end
of his next turn. Once per encounter, and once again after being bloodied,
Wolverine can use a <strong>Shrieking Strike</strong> that’s much stronger than the basic
attack and does a bit of splash damage to an enemy adjacent to the target. Hit
or miss, it grants Wolverine a +3 bonus to all defenses until the end of his
next turn. This can be used as part of a charge.</p>

<p>Despite my joking, this Wolverine doesn’t regenerate.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 1 entropist, 2 wolverines, 2 spriggan giantsouls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 3 entropists, 2 phase spiders, 1 satyr piper, and 1 will-o’-wisp.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All seem to be the sort of gnome who’s up to no good, since they include the
dodgier sort of fey (spriggans/redcaps and the wisp).</p>

<p>I like 4e gnomes, so I liked seeing more of them. The wolverine is particularly
fun, because it goes so hard against type.</p>

            <p>The absolutely best thing about the Monster Manual 2 gnolls is that I don’t have
to talk about them! It turns out I’ve already covered them all in the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/20/gnoll.html">MM1/Monster Vault gnoll post</a>. The Deathpledged Gnoll, Fang of Yeenoghu, and
Gnoll Gorger that appeared in the Monster Vault all had their first appearances
here in the MM2. Just read the original article for everything you need to know
about 4e gnolls.</p>
