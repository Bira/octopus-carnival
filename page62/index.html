<p>Bats are tiny nocturnal mammals who feed on fruit and insects… but those
aren’t the bats we’re talking about here. These bats are proper monsters.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>We get two different bat species here. Both are Medium, meaning they’re the size
of an adult human and have enough wingspan to get that bulk airborne.</p>

<p>Fire bats are Elemental Beasts (fire), which are native to the Elemental Chaos
but spread to the world through natural passages between the two planes and took
root here. In much the same way cats migrated to Australia on ships and became a
danger to the ecosystem, I guess.</p>

<p>Shadowunter bats are apparently native to the world. They’re descended from
normal bats who happened to live in places where necromantic energies from the
Shadowfell leaked through, and those energies mutated them.</p>

<p>Both types of monstrous bat have Int 2 and are Unaligned. They take well to
domestication, and so might be found as pets and guard animals for people or
intelligent monsters, particularly those that share origins with them. In fact,
the Fire Bat lore entry specifically mentions azer, which gives credence to my
theory that the azer used to be Heroic-tier opponents who got upgraded to
Paragon at the last minute.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Organizing monsters alphabetically by name means Bats are actually the first
real Heroic-tier creatures we’ve run across in the book. Angels had an
Heroic-tier variant but it was kind of a footnote among a bunch of more powerful
individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Shadowunter Bats</strong> are Level 3 Lurkers that have 38 HP and fight as
skirmishers. They’re quite clumsy on the ground, but fly with speed 8. It
appears they attack with a wickedly barbed tail, which has a bonus to attack and
does extra damage in dim light or darkness. They can use it in a Flyby Attack,
moving their speed and making a tail attack at any point (and not provoking
opportunity attacks when moving away).</p>

<p>Hm… if one or more of these attack the party, I’d expect them to do so in an
area that’s entirely shrouded in dim light or darkness. You’d think that this
would allow them to get the bonus damage all the time, but PCs are likely to be
carrying their own bright light sources in these places. So they’re going after
the rogue who’s scouting ahead without a light source. If domesticated, their
owners should probably employ some trick to neutralize the party’s lights.</p>

<p><strong>Fire Bats</strong> are Level 3 Skirmishers with 60 HP and 10 fire resistance. They
fly as fast as shadowunters, and are as clumsy on the ground. Being bats that
are on fire, their attack is a touch that does fire damage and ongoing fire
damage. Their version of the flyby attack allows them to shift 4 squares and
make an attack against anyone they touch on the way.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 3, a party of goblins and their two shadowhunter
bat pets.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Functional opposition for when your party ventures into bat country. I think the
fire bats work a little better, since the shadowunter’s bonus damage is too
fiddly. Changing it so that they only need to <em>start</em> their turn in dim light or
darkness to get the bonus would make them work better.</p>

<p>Since they’re only level 3 regulars, the math bug doesn’t affect them all that
much.</p>

            <p>Steve Jackson has another kickstarter for DFRPG going! While the main goal for
this one is the creation of a second monster book for the game, they’ve also
bundled in the costs of reprinting the wonderful physical box set for the
original game.</p>

<p>You see, they’re using this particular campaign as a way to gauge player
interest in GURPS. If it funds successfully, they’ll commit to doing “big” books
for the GURPS as a whole in the future. If it doesn’t, then support will
continue only in the form of small PDF supplements, one or two a month.</p>

<p>By the look of things, the project <em>will</em> fund, but only just. So if like GURPS
and haven’t thought about pledging to it yet, go to the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/warehouse23/powered-by-gurps-dungeon-fantasy-monsters-2-and-ga">campaign page</a> and
do it! For only US$10 you’ll get the PDF of the new book, and there are pricier
options for people who want physical copies or other books as well.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t play DFRPG specifically, you’ll still get some mileage out of
a bestiary, which is the sort of book people always complain is missing from
GURPS. And if you <em>do</em> play it, then what you have is a win-win situation right
there.</p>

<p>If you have no idea what GURPS Dungeon Fantasy is all about (unlikely, if you’re
reading this blog), you can see this <a href="http://www.gamesdiner.com/2019/03/31-reasons-why-you-want-to-pick-up-dungeon-fantasy-roleplaying-game-and-fast">excellent post</a> with no less than 31
reasons why it’s awesome.</p>

<p>The PDF of the game itself is available at <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/products/dungeon-fantasy-roleplaying-game">Warehouse 23</a> for US$40 (you have
to choose PDF in the format dropdown there). Forty American dollars might sound
like a lot, especially if you’re reading this in Brazil, but this is actually
less than the price of a single D&amp;D core book. And it gives you a full fantasy
game that’s better than D&amp;D (yes, I went there)!</p>

<p>Basilisks are another traditional D&amp;D monster that’s been around since at least
the days of Basic. Here they’re Large natural beasts, in the form of beefy grey
eight-legged lizards with copious spines running down their backs. Basilisks
appear in both the Monster Manual and the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual is surprisingly spare on basilisk lore. It says here they’re
strangely evolved drakes that use their deadly gazes to hunt for food. The same
gaze makes them highly feared. It <em>is</em> possible to tame and train them, though,
like other members of the drake family.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault is a lot more poetic about it. Most people know very little
about basilisks because most civilians who meet one don’t survive to tell the
tale. The beast isn’t malicious and doesn’t actively seek out sapient prey, but
it will literally kill you as soon as it looks at you. If a settlement begins to
have trouble with people going into the woods and disappearing, it could be
because a basilisk made its lair nearby.</p>

<p>Well, that’s nice and atmospheric and all, but this is D&amp;D. “People have been
going missing in the woods” doesn’t really narrow it down at all. There are
dozens of monsters that could be responsible for it.</p>

<p>Anyway, there are several separate varieties of basilisk, each with a different
(but still unpleasant) gaze. Some are solitary, some are pack hunters. They’re a
rare case of a fantastic animal that originated in the world and managed to
spread to the Feywild, so you can find them there as well.</p>

<p>People who manage to tame a basilisk usually employ it as a guard animal in an
area where no other allies are present. Well, no allies that are not expendable
or immune to the gaze. Common basilisk tamers include demons, who keep them as
pets or use them as muscle in incursions to the world.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The signature trait of all basilisks is of course the gaze, which is an area
attack whose effect varies by specific monster.</p>

<p>The <strong>Venom-Eye Basilisk</strong> is level 10 artillery and has 87 HP and Speed 6. It’s
AC is surprisingly tough for a monster of its role and level (27 in the MM, 24
in the MV), and its Fortitude is only slightly less beefy. Its other defenses
are average.</p>

<p>Its bite is relatively weak, and its gaze does poison damage plus ongoing 5
poison damage on a hit. Anyone taking ongoing damage from this gaze also causes
2 poison damage to anyone next to them. Hit or miss, the gaze attack also causes
targets to take a -2 penalty to their attacks for a turn.</p>

<p>The MM version is completely immune to poison, while the MV version has poison
resistance 5. I get the idea behind the immunity - they want the basilisk to be
immune to its own gaze, which is vital if you want to make them pack hunters. I
<em>think</em> that’s still supposed to be the case in the MV versions, but you could
still hit it with different poisons and have those be effective if they’re
strong enough.</p>

<p>The <strong>Stone-Eye Basilisk</strong> is the classic model, called only a <strong>Basilisk</strong> in
the Monster Vault. The MM version is a level 12 soldier and the MV version a
level 12 controller. Both have 126 HP and similar traits aside from that.</p>

<p>This basilisk is of course immune to petrification, and has a Baleful Gaze that
slows for a turn anyone within 5 squares that attacks the basilisk. That’s
automatic, no attack roll involved. Closing your eyes won’t prevent this either,
since it happens when <em>it</em> sees <em>you</em>. The actual gaze <em>attack</em> is a close blast
3, and it sets off a chain reaction: Slowed -&gt; Immobilized -&gt; Petrified, with
the condition worsening on each failed save. I believe this model of gradually
worsening conditions was one of 4e’s big mechanical innovations. In previous
edition, attacks like these would just be save-or-die; now you have time to
panic.</p>

<p>The basilisk also has a strong bite, which the lore specifically notes makes it
capable of eating creatures petrified by its gaze.</p>

<p>These first two are actually two versions of the basilisk legend! In some
stories it would turn you to stone, in others it just kills you.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault has two additional basilisk varietals: the <strong>wilt-eye</strong> is a
level 11 controller with 117 HP, with a gentler gaze that gives you a penalty to
your attacks and knocks you out on the first failed save.</p>

<p>And then there’s the <strong>Abyssal Basilisk</strong> who is a Chaotic Evil elemental beast
instead of natural and unaligned. This is the one demons raise in the
Abyss. It’s level 13 artillery, and its gaze drives one mad with horror. The
chain goes: 10 ongoing psychic damage -&gt; make a basic attack against your
closest ally -&gt; 10 ongoing psychic damage <em>and</em> you’re dominated.</p>

<p>The suggested encounters in the MM are a level 11 against 2 venom-eyes and 2
mezzodemons, and a level 12 against 2 stone-eyes, a fey choker, and a dryad
witch. The mezzodemons aren’t bothered by the poison gaze, but the fey duo are
<em>not</em> immune to petrification, so they should watch their positioning.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>What can I say? It’s a classic for a reason, and even the MV didn’t see fit to
change its workings other than fixing the damage). I did like the addition of
the wilt-eye basilisk - that’s an encounter a commoner could actually survive! I
mean, if basilisks behave like normal wild animals, then they’re rarely
people-eaters. They’d be killing people either by accident (can’t stop the gaze)
or in self-defense. A wilt-eye would just knock the commoner out and leave.</p>

<p>That goes for the natural versions, of course. The Abyssal one has been turned
into a standard attack-on-sight-fight-to-the-death monster by the hard work of
generations of demon breeders.</p>

<p>This is another entry in my Let’s Read of the Monster Manual and Monster Vault
for D&amp;D Fourth Edition. You can see the rest of them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>A Banshrae is a Medium fey humanoid that looks like the love child of an elf and
a praying mantis. Tall and rail-thin, they have alabaster skin, long clawed
fingers and triangular mouthless faces with insectile eyes. They’re originally
from Third Edition’s Monster Manual V, and here they’re only on the Monster
Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Banshraes are Unaligned, and the ones we see in this entry have an Int of 14 and
a Charisma of 20. Nevertheless, the text repeatedly describes them as cold,
sinister and egotistical, with a tendency to view other sapients as sources of
amusement or loot rather than as people. The nicest among them are pranking
tricksters, and the bad apples are sadistic serial killers. I guess you don’t
need to officially swear allegiance to the cosmic principle of Evil to be an
asshole.</p>

<p>Having no mouth, banshraes communicate via telepathy. I guess they either don’t
need food at all or feed on someting like ambient magic. One interesting factoid
is that banshraes love singing and the sound of wind instruments, despite having
no way to sing or play themselves. Stories speak of people who managed to avoid
being pranked/murdered by a banshrae by singing or playing tunes to it.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Banshraes have speed 8 and low-light vision. Their other signature trait is
actually a piece of signature gear: a blowgun and darts, which they can use
despite having no mouth. I picture them doing a fancy palm strike on one end of
the blowgun to fire a dart out of the other.</p>

<p>The <strong>Banshrae Dartswarmer</strong> is level 11 artillery with 89 HP, who fights
unarmed in melee but whose specialty is firing poisoned blowgun darts that do
damage, daze and inflict a penalty to attacks. Every so often (recharge 3-6)
then can go “full auto” and fire a dart flurry with the same effect at anyone in
a close blast 5. That basically hits the entire PC party unless they’re <em>very</em>
spread out.</p>

<p>The <strong>Banshrae Warrior</strong> is a level 12 skirmisher with 121 HP who can also use a
blowgun but who focuses on its praying mantis kung-fu. It can shift 1 square as
a minor action after hitting with a melee attack, and it has two of those: a
basic slam, and the Staggering Palm. Staggering Palm does damage and stuns the
target for a turn, but only recharges after the banshrae uses Mantid Dance.</p>

<p>Mantid Dance is a move action, and lasts a turn. While in effect, it gives the
banshrae warrior +2 to all defenses (okay) and makes <em>all ranged attacks
automatically miss it</em> (jeepers creepers!). Oh, and they do increased damage if
they move far enough during their turn. Having good defenders and solid melee
strikers is a must when fighting these fey.</p>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 12: 2 dartswarmers, 1 warrior, 1 ettin
spirit-talker and 1 iron gorgon (of the bull-looking kind). I’m guessing these
aren’t the “nice” banshraes.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I don’t think I’m entirely sold on the “heartless serial killer” presentation,
but the mechanics inspire me to do a Five Venoms kung-fu storyline with a
banshrae dojo as the villains. You could also tone the serial killer thing down
and present them as more cruel pranksters who aren’t necessarily out for blood.</p>
