My name is Ubiratan Pires Alberton, AKA Bira, and I'm a software developer from
Brazil. I've been into roleplaying games ever since I was 10, and by now I've
gotten to that point where I often think about statting up the stuff I see on
media I enjoy in one system or another. I eventually decided to put some of
those idle thougths to writing, and since most of the RPG material I've been
reading for the past few years has been in English, that language is the one in
which my ideas flow best.

Octopus Carnival is my English-language RPG blog. Most of its content is
GURPS-related, and usually deals with adapting something or other to GURPS. I
try to update daily or as close to it as possible.
