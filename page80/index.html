<p>I clearly remember Cambions existed in third edition, though I don’t know if
they date from earlier than that. They’re only statted up in the Monster Manual.</p>

<p>Cambions are the offspring of devils and “depraved or unwitting” mortals. This
wording is interesting because it specifically excludes violent rape. The mortal
in question is either aware and willing, or being seduced by a “beautiful
stranger” who later vanishes in the night. It fits the devil idiom in 4e.</p>

<p>It appears Cambions are usually raised by the mother, either in the World or in
the Nine Hells. In either case they’re evil and vicious from childhood, taking
on the worst traits of both parent species. I guess it’s technically possible
for there to be a non-evil cambion, but the ones in the book aren’t them.</p>

<p>Cambions look like red-skinned humans with wings and horns. The book presents us
with two varieties. They’re both Medium Immortal Humanoids (devil). The “devil”
keyword marks them as official devils, and has a few rules attached: devils
breathe and eat, but do not sleep. They are however not immune to sleep effects.</p>

<h2 id="cambion-hellsword">Cambion Hellsword</h2>

<p>This guy is a Level 8 Brute with 106 HP. He has darkvision, resist 10 fire,
speed 6, and a flight speed of 8 (clumsy). The “clumsy” keyword means he takes a
-4 penalty to attacks and defenses while flying, so he only uses the wings to go
from point A to point B. He wears mail and carries a flaming greatsword.</p>

<p>The hellsword’s basic attack is, well, the hell-sword which does physical damage
and ongoing fire damage. When he charges he can make a sword attack against
every enemy in range, and gains 5 temporary HP whenever he bloodies an enemy or
reduces them to 0 HP.</p>

<p>The hellsword fights like a bowling ball, charging groups of enemies and then
focusing on whoever is closer to being bloodied or taken out.</p>

<h2 id="cambion-hellfire-magus">Cambion Hellfire Magus</h2>

<p>This gal is Level 18 Artillery, and is all about setting things on fire. She
possesses the same darkvision and speed as the hellsword, but her fire
resistance is 15.</p>

<p>Her basic melee attack is with a quarterstaff, and as usual for artillery
monsters it’s useless. Her main at-will attack is the Hellfire Ray, which
targets Reflex, does fire damage, and knocks prone on hit. She can also use
Soulscorch, an area attack that also targets reflex, and does both immediate and
ongoing fire damage. That one recharges on a 5-6.</p>

<p>The hellfire magus also has a passive Soul Mantle power, which gives her +4 to
AC and Reflex against ranged attacks.</p>

<p>Her tactics are simple: keep away and shoot fire. Her traits make it both
desirable and difficult for PCs to close to melee with her.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>Predictably, Cambions can be found hanging out with devils or with the sort of
evil being who likes to hang out with devils. The suggested encounters are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8, four hellswords and a succubus. One happy family?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18, 2 hellfire magi, a rakshasa noble, and 2 rockfire dreadnought
elementals. A rajah and his advisors plus some summoned muscle.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Back in the 3e days it took me the longest time to figure out what made cambions
different from tieflings. Both are descended from devils, right? Apparently the
difference was that cambions were direct offspring, while tieflings were who
knows how many generations removed from their fiendish ancestor. In 4e, of
course, tieflings are humans mutated by a diabolic pact their distant ancestors
made.</p>

<p>If you want to make a custom cambion, their “signature” traits are the devil
keyword, the fire resistance, and the wings with their clumsy flight
speed. Their attack powers seem to show a strong tendency towards fire, but
there’s no specific fire power all cambions have.</p>

<p>Story-wise, I’d say people don’t really summon cambions despite them having the
devil keyword. Rather, cambions arrive at a place by themselves and tempt other
people into diabolism.</p>

<p>Bullettes, or Land Sharks, have been a part of D&amp;D since the very beginning. As
legend has it, Gary Gygax got the inspiration for them from a cheap plastic
“dinosaur” toy he had lying around. They look like a cross between a rhino and a
mole with, yes, a bullet-shaped head. Their bodies are covered in tough plates.</p>

<p>They’re on both the Monster Manual and Monster Vault: the MM has a normal
Bullete and a Dire Bullette. The Vault updates these two and adds a Young
Bullette. If you have the Monster Vault you can safely use only its versions of
the monster without missing anything. The lore below is combined from both
books, with the Vault containing the most detail.</p>

<p>In 4e, land sharks are naturally occurring predators. They’re both always hungry
and dumb as a bag of hammers. The creatures will arrive at a region, eat
everything that moves, and move on in search of more food. When this happens
near a human settlement, the usual response from the humans is to pull up stakes
and move away.</p>

<p>Bullettes hunt by detecting prey with their tremorsense and bursting out the
ground with great force underneath the chosen victims. They’ll try to eat
anything smaller than themselves, and to fight anything larger out of sheer
orneriness. These beasts are solitary, but might “accidentally” become part of
an encounter with other monsters by bursting out of the ground mid-fight and
trying to eat everyone.</p>

<p>All bullettes here have darkvision, tremorsense 20, a ground speed of 6 and a
burrow speed of 6. When they burrow or emerge from the ground, the squares where
the transision happened become difficult terrain. The longer a fight against a
bullette goes on, the more messed up the surrounding terrain becomes.</p>

<h2 id="young-bullette">Young Bullette</h2>

<p>The young bullette still hasn’t fully developed the boundless stamina of an
adult specimen. It’s a Medium Natural Beast and a Level 7 Lurker with 68 HP.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a somewhat weak bite, which becomes a lot more damaging
when used as part of the Snapping Jaws power. To use it, the monster must be
underground. It burrows up to its speed and emerges adjacent to an opponent,
making a much more damaging bite attack as it does so. This doesn’t provoke
opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>The youngling can them disengage with Submerge in Earth, an at-will standard
action which allows it to shift one square, burrow up to its speed, and recharge
Snapping Jaws.</p>

<p>This strong-bite/disengage/strong-bite pattern is what makes the Young Bullette
a lurker. It’s not trying to hide from you, it just needs a little run-up to
properly tear your head off.</p>

<h2 id="bullette">Bullette</h2>

<p>The classic model, a fully developed specimen. It’s a Large Natural Beast, and a
Level 9 Elite Skirmisher with 200 HP.</p>

<p>The adult Bullette’s basic bite is a lot stronger than that of the youngling,
and does extra damage to prone targets. It can optionally jump up to 5 squares
before using it, without provoking opportunity attacks. Climbing a tree will not
save you!</p>

<p>If it’s underground, it can use Rising Burst, burrowing up to its speed without
provoking opportunity attacks and attacking on a Close Burst 2 when it
emerges. This is a little less damaging than the single-target bite but still
does half damage on a miss.</p>

<p>All of the three attacks above are at-will standard actions!</p>

<p>As a move action, it can use Earth Furrow, which allows it to burrow its speed
at a depth of 1 square (again without provoking OAs). If it passes beneath an
enemy space, it makes an attack against the enemy’s Fortitude, which does no
damage but knocks the enemy prone on a hit.</p>

<p>All of these abilities can come together to make an impressive alpha strike:
Earth Furrow to enter the fight while knocking people around, and then a Rising
Burst followed by an Action Point-fueled Leaping Bite. “A bullette bursts from
the ground and catches 25 feet of air with the wizard in its mouth!”</p>

<p>The Monster Manual version is pretty much the same, but buggier. Slightly lower
damage, oddly lower accuracy, and it forces you to reference the rules for
standing long jumps to figure out how far it leaps. MM bullettes can also use a
Second Wind once per encounter, which recovers 51 HP and gives them a temporary
defense boost.</p>

<p>Second Wind on monsters is an early mechanic that quickly fell out of favor with
players and designers. It’s pretty much just a more convoluted form of giving
monsters an extra 25% HP, and generally only serves to make fights last longer.</p>

<h2 id="dire-bullette">Dire Bullette</h2>

<p>Every natural predator has a dire version. The bullette is a natural
predator. Therefore, it has a dire version. This nightmare is a Huge Natural
Beast, a Level 18 Elite Skirmisher with 350 HP. Its ground and burrow speed are
8.</p>

<p>It fights exactly like the “common” bullette, with increased damage appropriate
to its level. Its leaping bite allows it to leap 7 squares instead of just 5,
and the Rising Burst has a radius of 3 instead of 2.</p>

<p>Being Huge, it’s likely to make the whole battlemap into difficult terrain
before the PCs manage to slay it.</p>

<p>The MM version even has similar differences! As with the common bullette, you
don’t lose anything by using the MV version at all times.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-thoughts">Encounters And Thoughts</h2>

<p>The suggested encounter in the MM is level 9, a bullette intruding on a fight
with a group of 3 trolls.</p>

<p>A bullette is kind of a one-note monster. However, it plays that note very well
indeed. I like it!</p>

<p>Here’s another monster I never heard of, though I’m almost sure they come from a
previous edition. They’re on the Monster Manual only.</p>

<p>Like Bodaks, Boneclaws are constructed undead that don’t occur naturally. Lots
of necromantically inclined villains (liches, Orcus priests and the like) use
them as guards and assassins. Creating one involves building a body from corpse
parts and binding an evil soul into it through magic. The result is a Large
Shadow Animate (undead), with variable-length talons that can reach 10 feet in
length at maximum extension.</p>

<p>The ritual for creating a boneclaw is one of those “secrets” that keeps being
stolen and traded away all the time. Some people say it was first developed by
Vecna himself, though the true authors are a coven of hags led by the night hag
Grigwartha. Her version of it used the corpse of an ogre and the soul of an oni,
but others have adapted it for different “raw materials”. Grigwartha frequently
traded the ritual for favors from other necromancers, so if you want your
current villain to have access to boneclaws you don’t need any special
explanation for it.</p>

<p>This entry has only a single variety, appropriately named <strong>Boneclaw</strong>. It’s a
Level 14 Soldier with 136 HP and the usual undead traits of immunity to disease
and poison plus Resist 20 necrotic and Vulnerable 5 Radiant. It’s far from
mindless, with Int 10 and an Evil disposition. It speaks Common, and runs at you
with Speed 8.</p>

<p>The boneclaw attacks with its claws (duh), which have Reach 3 and Threatening
Reach. If a boneclaw hits someone with an opportunity attack, it can make
another opportunity attack against the same target in the same turn. A nasty
surprise to people who think they’re safe after the first one.</p>

<p>When bloodied, it lets out a Necrotic Pulse in a Close Burst 10, healing undead
allies by 10 points and damaging living enemies by the same amount.</p>

<p>A relatively simple yet flavorful monster, whose flavor is further enhanced by
whomever you partner it with. The sample encounter is level 14, a lich and its
complement of bodyguards: two boneclaws and a shield guardian.</p>

<p>If you want to build a custom boneclaw, an assassin version that’s a Lurker or
Skirmisher instead of a Soldier might be appropriate. Other than the undead
resistances, the signature trait here seems to be the long Reach on the claws
and doing something necrotic when it’s bloodied.</p>

<p>A D&amp;D original, the bodak first appeared in AD&amp;D if I’m not mistaken. They were
one of the many high-level undead that resulted when someone really evil died,
with the specific type of evil generating different monsters. They’ve always
looked like Grey aliens with oblong heads and narrow, empty eyes.</p>

<p>Here, they keep the look, but have a different origin: when a Nightwalker kills
someone, it can ritually transform the slain creature’s corpse and spirit into a
bodak servant. Therefore, bodaks can be found either hanging around
nightwalkers, or running missions for their masters along with other undead.</p>

<p>Bodaks are Evil and not very smart, so the occasional free bodak is more likely
to find itself a lair where it can ocasionally kill passers-by than to hatch
complicated evil schemes of its own.</p>

<p>This Monster Manual entry gives us two different bodaks: the Skulk and the
Reaver. There are no bodaks in the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="bodak-skulk">Bodak Skulk</h2>

<p>From the looks of it, this is the classic model. A level 16 Lurker, with Int 6
and 124 HP, the skulk has darkvision and an Agonizing Gaze aura: anyone in its
radius (5 squares) who makes a ranged or melee attack against the bodak takes 5
necrotic damage before the attack, and a -2 penalty to the roll. This is both a
gaze and a fear effect, and doesn’t affect people doing close or area attacks,
so wizards take note!</p>

<p>As expected, this is a Medium Shadow Humanoid (undead). This is not the first
undead monster we see in this Let’s Read, but I haven’t explained the keyword
before. It’s pretty much like you’d expect: undead don’t breathe or sleep,
aren’t affected by anything that specifically targets living creatures and <em>are</em>
affected by anything that targets undead.</p>

<p>The Skulk moves at speed 6. It’s immune to disease and poison, and has Resist 15
necrotic. It’s also Vulnerable 5 to radiant damage, and if it takes radiant
damage it can’t weaken anyone with its basic attack for a turn.</p>

<p>The Bodak Skulk attacks with a slam that does a mix of physical and necrotic
damage, and also weakens the target for a turn. Once per encounter it can focus
its gaze on a single target, attacking their Fortitude: if this hits a weakened
PC, the PC is immediately reduced to 0 HP. This is pretty serious, but it’s not
quite instant death like in previous editions. If the target is not weakened,
they take necrotic damage and lose a healing surge (this edition’s equivalent of
negative levels).</p>

<p>Finally, as an at-will standard action, the creature can turn invisible,
insubstantial and gain phasing. In this state it can do nothing but move, and
can return to physicality as a free action.</p>

<p>This thing is going to follow the party invisibly while waiting for a chance to
attack, then will reveal itself right next to a vulnerable character, weaken
then with the slam and fix its gaze on them on its next turn. It will likely do
all of this as the party is hit by a group of less subtle undead.</p>

<p>The skulk’s big Lurker Attack is the death gaze - once that’s expended, it
becomes a somewhat more fragile skirmisher. Early edition damage issues make it
quite weak in direct combat, and fixing those would go a long way to make as
threatening as its level indicates.</p>

<h2 id="bodak-reaver">Bodak Reaver</h2>

<p>The Bodak Reaver is the Skulk’s smarter, braver cousin. Another Medium Shadow
Humanoid (undead), the reaver is a Level 18 Soldier with Int 10 and 175 HP,
wearing plate and wielding a greataxe.</p>

<p>It has pretty much the same resistances and vulnerabilities as the Bodak Skulk,
except its necrotic resistance is a little higher at 20. Its basic greataxe
attack does a mix of physical and necrotic damage, and both dazes and weakens on
a hit. Since the text of the vulnerability is the same, I’m going to assume this
still dazes even when it can’t weaken, and that this is the main way in which it
fulfills its soldierly function.</p>

<p>The Reaver’s Agonizing and Death Gazes are the same as the skulk’s. Bodaks gonna
bodak.</p>

<p>Finally, the reaver is a Death Drinker: if any living creature is reduced to 0
hit points within 5 squares of it, the reaver gains +1 to attacks for a turn,
and 15 temporary HP. That’s not just PCs! If the reaver has living allies, their
deaths will also make it stronger.</p>

<p>Like the skulk, the Bodak Reaver is in major need of a damage update. Other than
that I don’t see anything wrong with it.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The suggested encounter here is level 18, a bodak reaver and two slaugher wights
commanded by a cambion hellfire magus.</p>

<p>Overall, it seems 4e Bodaks aren’t going to fill a party with dread in the same
way an old-school bodak would, since each of them can only <em>mostly</em> kill someone
with a gaze once per fight. Of course, an all-bodak monster squad can still
potentially kill the whole party with their gazes if they coordinate well,
something which is already perfectly possible at Int 10.</p>

<p>Making custom bodaks is doable: aside from being undead, their signature
abilities are the Agonizing and Death gazes, and a melee attack that weakens. A
memorable villain the party has faced in the past could be raised as a bodak and
employed as a lieutenant by a necromancy-themed Big Bad.</p>

<p>Boars are real animals, so you probably know what they look like
already. Boar-hunting was a very prestigious and difficult endeavor in medieval
times, since real-world wild boars are deadly opposition for someone armed with
a spear.</p>

<p>Still, the Monster Manual seems to think your typical PC party would have little
trouble handling real-world boars, much like Asterix and Obelix. So it provides
us with more extreme versions.</p>

<p>These exist only on the Monster Manual - while the Monster Vault has an appendix
on animals, it doesn’t contain boars.</p>

<h2 id="dire-boar">Dire Boar</h2>

<p>Like a real-world boar, but bigger, meaner, and spikier. It’s a Large Natural
Beast (mount). Creatures with the “mount” keyword confer special abilities to
their riders. Not all beasts that can serve as mounts have the keyword - only
those who grant these abilities to their riders. Early rules for mounted combat
stated that PCs had to have the Mounted Combat feat to benefit from these mount
powers, and mount stat blocks usually stated that the rider also had to have a
minimum level. All of this had been done away with by the time the MV came out.</p>

<p>Indeed, dire boars can be domesticated as mounts, though even then they’re
ill-tempered and tough to handle. They’re also the preferred mount for dwarven
cavalry units. So yeah, dwarves have dire boar cavalry! It makes perfect sense
when you think about it: the riders have a temper to match that of their mounts,
and the mounts menace with spikes of bone.</p>

<p>Rules-wise, dire boars are Level 6 Brutes, have 85 HP, and move with
Speed 8. They attack by goring with their tusks, which does extra damage against
a prone target. When the boar is reduced to 0 HP, it gores one last time as a
free action.</p>

<p>They’re also good at charging! A gore attack done as part of a charge does extra
damage, pushes the target 2 squares and knocks them prone. So their preferred
tactic is to charge someone and them gore them repeatedly while they’re down.</p>

<p>If used as a mount, the boar gets to make a gore attack in
addition to the rider’s attack when the duo charges. The way I understand it,
this gore attack also gets the charge benefit I described above.</p>

<h2 id="thunderfury-boar">Thunderfury Boar</h2>

<p>The platonic ideal of a badass boar, native to the Feywild. It’s even bigger,
even meaner, and even spikier than a dire boar. This boar is a Large fey beast,
no mount keyword. You can’t truly domesticate these beasts, but clever fey
sometimes keep them captive and release them in the general direction of people
they want dead. They have Int 5 but no languages. Whether this means they’re
super-cunning animals or actually sapient is left as an exercise for the GM.</p>

<p>The thunderfury boar is a Level 15 Brute with 182 HP and ground speed 8. It
fights in much the same way as its cousing above, with goring charges followed
by more goring, but it has a few differences aside from the increased
damage. Its basic gore attack deals increased damage when the boar is bloodied,
and its charges deal an extra 10 thunder damage on top of that. It also has an
attack named Thunderfury, rechaging on 5-6, which from what I understand it is a
big stomp that sends a shockwave around the boar. It’s a close burst 2 that
targets Fort, does thunder damage and knocks prone. On a miss, it still deals
half damage.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 5, a dire boar and a party of 5 orc regulars (1
shaman, 4 berserkers). Having one of the berserkers ride the boar will give you
the most bang for the buck when it comes to charging attacks.</p>

<p>The most awesome thing for me here was the bit about dwarven boar cavalry. I’m
really tempted to stat up a unit of level 6 dwarven knights riding dire
boars. Beware the charge of the 15th Thundertusks!</p>
