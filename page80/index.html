<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>D&amp;D Trolls are inspired by the writings of Poul Anderson and have been in the
game since the beginning. Here, they are present in both the Monster Manual and
the Vault. I’m telling you in advance: I’m not gonna make jokes about rude
Internet posters.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Trolls are large humanoid creatures with amazing regenerative powers, able to
survive just about anything and thrive just about anywhere. This same remarkable
metabolism makes it so trolls are always hungry and in search of food. They’ll
eat anything that’s smaller than themselves and made of meat.</p>

<p>The only things that can temporarily overwhelm a troll’s regeneration are fire
and acid. One of these is required to kill a troll permanently - it can come
back from anything else. This makes them pretty much fearless in combat. Trolls
attack even when they’re outnumbered and when the enemies seem strong, because
they’re confident in their survival. Even the presence of fire and acid doesn’t
get them to back off right away, though in this case they might retreat if they
get too hurt.</p>

<p>I imagine this made trolls into dangerous puzzle monsters back when they were
new, but now pretty much any D&amp;D veteran is going to know about their
weaknesses. Many arcane characters have easy sources of fire or acid at hand,
and other “caster” types might have an encounter power or two that deal those
types of damage. If your wizard is one of those charop types that went all in on
psychic and force spells, though, you’re in for a tought fight.</p>

<p>If you have no other source of fire you can “kill” the troll with
conventional weapons and stick a lit torch in it to finish the job, but even
that is easier said than done. And adventurers these days tend to prefer those
alchemical glow-sticks as light sources, so they might not even have torches
available if they don’t know a troll is around!</p>

<p>Trolls are sapient, but not very smart. Still smarter than ogres,
though. Tricking the typical troll is easy, provided you can get it to talk to
you instead of immediately ripping you apart and eating the pieces. All sorts of
villains and tyrants like to recruit trolls into their forces, since they’ll
readily work for a bit of money and a lot of food. Such trolls are all too glad
to receive additional training and gear from their bosses, and though they make
for undisciplined and rowdy soldiers, they’re deadly in a fight.</p>

<p>Evil wizards also love trolls, for a different reason. They can survive all
sorts of disturbing magical experiments, which tend to result in weird mutants
much stronger and much less mentally stable than a standard troll.</p>

<p>It’s perfectly possible for there to be trolls who aren’t evil and who don’t eat
other sapients, though even them they’d have a hard time coexisting with those
sapients since they require large hunting areas to sustain themselves. Even nice
trolls are likely to make their home in the wilderness far away from any
settlements.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Trolls are Large Natural Humanoids, and their signature traits are
<strong>Regeneration</strong> and <strong>Troll Healing</strong>.</p>

<p>As I explained in a previous entry, 4e Regeneration is more or less equivalent
to 3e’s Fast Healing: the monster recovers the specified amount of hit points at
the start of its turn as long as it has at least 1 HP remaining. For MM trolls,
this is either 10 or 15 depending on the stat block. For MV trolls, this is 5
across the board. Troll regeneration stops working for a turn if the monster
takes fire or acid damage.</p>

<p>Troll Healing is what makes them immortal: if a troll is reduced to 0 HP by
anything other than fire or acid damage, it recovers the specified amount of HP
and rises again at the start of its next turn. It can still be killed before it
rises if it takes fire or acid damage while down.</p>

<p>In addition to these, they can usually do something interesting when their basic
attack bloodies a target. Being Large creatures, all their attacks have
Reach 2. They only speak Giant, which is another barrier to nonviolent
communication.</p>

<h3 id="troll-both">Troll (Both)</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 9 Brute with 100 HP. The MV version has regeneration
10 and troll healing 10, while the MV version has regeneration 5 and troll
healing 15. Both have speed 8.</p>

<p>Trolls attack with their <strong>claws</strong>, and if their basic attack bloodies the
target they get to make another one against it as a free action. They have no
other special abilities, being quintessential brutes.</p>

<h3 id="battle-troll-monster-vault">Battle Troll (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>A troll who received extra training and equipment from its patrons. It’s a Level
12 Soldier with 124 HP. Its speed is reduced to 7 by armor, and its
regeneration/troll healing values are 5/15.</p>

<p>The battle troll wears scale and fights with a <strong>broadsword</strong>, which marks the
target for a turn. If a broadsword attack bloodies the target, the troll can
make another free attack against it. It can also use the sword to make
<strong>sweeping strikes</strong> which hit in a Close Blast 2 and knock targets prone.</p>

<h3 id="bladerager-troll-monster-vault">Bladerager Troll (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>The product of twisted Cocaine Wizard experiments, this is a troll who had tons
of sharp blades implanted all over its body. It’s a Level 12 Brute with 151 HP,
Speed 7, and Regeneration 5 <em>without</em> Troll Healing.</p>

<p>The bladerager attacks with its augmented <strong>claws</strong>, which can also perform a
<strong>Bladerager Rend</strong> once per encounter for massive immediate damage and ongoing
10 damage (save ends). A miss does half the immediate and ongoing damage. If the
basic claw attack bloodies a target, the Rend recharges.</p>

<p>When the bladerager reaches 0 HP, it explodes into a cloud of shrapnel! This
<strong>Death Burst</strong> targets affects a Close Burst 2 around the troll, doing a bit
less damage than the rend to everyone caught by it.</p>

<h3 id="ghost-troll-render-monster-vault">Ghost Troll Render (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>This troll died but didn’t even notice. It’ll still try to eat you. You can make
any regular troll into an elite of sorts by having one of these rise up from its
corpse.</p>

<p>Ghost Trolls are Level 13 Brutes with 161 HP and the Undead keyword. They have a
flight speed of 7 with Hover and Phasing, and are immune to disease and
poison. Lacking a body, they no longer regenerate and are instead
Insubstantial. This means they take half damage from anything but force
attacks. Getting hit by a radiant, fire or acid attack makes them substantial
for a turn.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Spirit Claw</strong> that targets Reflex, and they can
perform a <strong>Terror Strike</strong> (melee 2 vs. Will) that does a massive amount of
psychic damage and slows on a hit (save ends). The first failed save turns that
slowed status into unconsciousness, which ends on a sucessful save or if the
victim takes damage. This is an encounter power that recharges if it misses, so
chances are the ghost <em>will</em> scare someone this way during the fight.</p>

<h3 id="war-troll-monster-manual">War Troll (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>An earlier but slightly more flexible version of the MV Battle Troll. This one
is a Level 14 Soldier with 110 HP. It wears plate, wields a greatsword, but also
carries a longbow and a quiver full of arrows. Its speed is 7 and its
regeneration/troll healing values are 10/15.</p>

<p>It has the same <strong>greatsword</strong> and <strong>sweeping strike</strong> attacks of the Battle
Troll, and it also has <strong>Threatening Reach</strong> (2) and can use <strong>Blood Pursuit</strong>
as a reaction to shift 1 square closer to a bloodied enemy within 2 squares who
shifts. It can also fight at range with its <strong>Longbow</strong>, of course.</p>

<h3 id="fell-troll-monster-manual">Fell Troll (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>The biggest and baddest among trolls. They’re Huge, and Level 20 Elite Brutes
with 360 HP. Their speed is 10, their regeneration/troll healing values are
10/20, and they gain a +1 to attacks and a +2 to damage against bloodied
enemies.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 3 <strong>claw</strong>, and they can use Reach 3 <strong>backhand
slams</strong> as a 1/round minor action for extra damage and to push fools up to 4
squares.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I don’t think it’s possible for a game to call itself D&amp;D without including
green regenerating trolls in its bestiary. Non-D&amp;D games can still have them, of
course: GURPS Dungeon Fantasy does.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual has three sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 9: 3 trolls and 2 destrachans. The destrachans are slightly smarter than
the trolls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 16: 2 war trolls, 1 night hag, 5 grimlock minions, a drow priest, and a
drow blademaster. A group so diverse it could be an evil adventuring party.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 19: 1 fell troll, 2 enormous carrion crawlers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>War and battle trolls can be found alongside anyone who is willing to pay
them. The others would be found with more trolls, and with creatures they might
have decided to keep as pets. Mechanically, they need that company to make for
more interesting fights, because their abilities aren’t very varied on their
own.</p>

<p>Adding some trolls to a “wilderness” region you’re populating might work as a
fine explanation for why all those other deadly monsters don’t spill out and
overwhelm nearby “points of light”. If anyone would hunt and eat bullettes, dire
boars, roaming gricks and maybe even the occasional drow scouting party, it’s a
bunch of trolls.</p>

<p>Troglodytes appear on the Rules Cyclopedia, so they’ve been around at least
since BECMI and likely since the beginning. Here, they are in both the Monster
Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Troglodytes are sapient reptilian humanoids native to the Underdark, one of the
notable minority that seems to have evolved there instead of being a Far Realm
or surface import. They secrete a foul-smelling mucus over their scaly hides,
and seem to be resistant enough to disease that they don’t really care about
personal hygiene on top of that. Their settlements present the unprepared
visitor with a nightmarish olfactory experience.</p>

<p>Troglodytes reproduce by laying eggs, with the female laying close to a hundred
of them at once. Only a minority of those will both hatch and survive to
adulthood, which they reach in two years.</p>

<p>Troglodyte culture is at a paleolithic level of technological development, and
though it’s egalitarian when it comes to gender it’s extremely
xenophobic. Anyone not of the same tribe is an enemy to be killed and eaten, or
captured and sacrificed to Torog (god of suffering and imprisonment) in an long,
torture-filled ceremony. Troglodyte tribes fight each other as bitterly as they
fight anyone else - when two tribes move into the same area, the most likely
outcomes are for one of them to be annihilated or for the two to be so weakened
they ironically end up merging under a strong leader. When resources grow scarce
in their current territory they will gladly raid the surface.</p>

<p>It makes a little bit of sense for troglodytes to be this horrible when you
think about it. Any less powerful Underdark culture is likely to grow a
xenophobic streak when their most frequent neighbors are drow, duergar, and mind
flayers. And if these three big empires base all of their power on slavery and
torture, it’s not inconceivable that a culture they prey on would try to do the
same, and venerate the god that presides over these things.</p>

<p>None of this stops the Big Three from regularly enslaving troglodytes and using
them as muscle. I imagine it could also be possible to find bands of troglodytes
who aren’t xenophobic Torog worshippers and who are on friendlier terms with
other species. Perhaps they might even live on the surface.</p>

<p>This is another instance where the Monster Vault breaks out the full
Lovecraftian Racism Vocabulary, calling them “degenerate reptile folk”,
“loathsome primitives”, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Troglodytes are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Reptile keyword. They have
darkvision and a land speed of 5. Their signature trait is of course
<strong>Troglodyte Stench</strong>, an aura (1) that inflicts a -2 penalty to the attacks of
any living enemies inside.</p>

<p>They mostly fight with claws or stone weapons, though they also have
spellcasters who use Torog-themed magic. We have a total of 6 unique stat blocks
between the two books (4 each, with 2 appearing in both).</p>

<h3 id="troglodyte-mauler-both">Troglodyte Mauler (Both)</h3>

<p>The Monster Vault version is by far the best one, so we’ll start with that.</p>

<p>A Level 6 Soldier with 74 HP, the mauler fights in melee with a <strong>greatclub</strong>
and with its <strong>claws</strong>, both of which are considered basic attacks. Both are
equivalent damage-wise, but the club marks for a turn on a hit. The mauler also
carries a pair of <strong>javelins</strong> for throwing at range 10.</p>

<p>If the mauler has combat advantage against an enemy, it can use a minor-action
<strong>bite</strong> against them 1/round. This targets Fortitude, damages, and makes the
target regain only half HP from healing for a turn. Bacteria, baby!</p>

<p>The Monster Manual version is a lot less interesting, since its damage suffers
from the bug and it lacks the javelins and the bite.</p>

<h3 id="troglodyte-grunt-monster-vault">Troglodyte Grunt (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>Grunts are Level 6 Minion Skirmishers, with all the standard troglodyte
traits. They fight with <strong>clubs</strong> that do minion-level damage and allow they to
shift 2 squares as an effect. When targeted by area attacks they can <strong>scatter</strong>
as an interrupt, shifting up to 2 squares to a place outside the area of
effect.</p>

<p>That last bit should give you some laughs the first time the party wizard smugly
tries to hit them with an area spell.</p>

<h3 id="troglodyte-thrasher-monster-vault">Troglodyte Thrasher (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>Thrashers are Level 7 Brutes with 100 HP. They don’t bother with weapons, and
fight with their <strong>claws</strong>. They also have a <strong>Tooth and Claw</strong> at-will attack
that does roughly half the damage of a basic claw, but can attack one creature
twice or two creatures once. If one of these attacks bloody the target, the
troglodyte can make a basic claw attack against them.</p>

<p>So depending on how you spread Tooth and Claw around, you could end up doing
three times the damage of the basic claw in a round (1.5 times base damage to
each of two targets you just bloodied)!</p>

<h3 id="troglodyte-impaler-both">Troglodyte Impaler (Both)</h3>

<p>Impalers are Level 7 Artillery with 69 HP. They fight with <strong>spears</strong> in melee
and throw <strong>javelins</strong> at range (they start with 6). The MM also gives them a
useless claw attack.</p>

<p>Aside from making basic attacks, the impaler can use a javelin to make an
<strong>Impaling Shot</strong> (ranged 10 vs. AC; recharge 3-6), which does the same damage
and restrains the target (save ends) by going right through it and into the
ground.</p>

<h3 id="troglodyte-curse-chanter-monster-manual">Troglodyte Curse Chanter (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>A spellcaster, likely a priest of Torog or a primal caster who communes with
underground spirits. It’s a Level 8 Controller with the Leader keyword and 93
HP.</p>

<p>The curse chanter wields a <strong>quarterstaff</strong> and also fights with <strong>claws</strong>, but
the real firepower comes from its magic. It can shoot <strong>poison rays</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Fortitude) that do poison damage and weaken (save ends). It can call down a
<strong>cavern curse</strong> (ranged 5 vs. Fortitude; recharge 3-6) that inflicts ongoing
necrotic damage and slows (save ends both). It can bless its allies with
<strong>Tunnel Grace</strong> (close burst 10; minor action 1/round; recharge 4-6) to give
them +5 speed for a turn. And it can sing a <strong>chant of renewal</strong> (close burst 5;
encounter) to heal all bloodied allies in range for 15 HP.</p>

<h3 id="troglodyte-warrior-monster-manual">Troglodyte Warrior (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>These are Level 12 Minions, which makes them suitable to represent enslaved
cannon fodder in the service of drow or mind flayers. They have the common
traits of darkvision and the stench, and a basic <strong>club</strong> attack, being
otherwise unremarkable. You’re better off leveling up the Grunts from the MV and
using those instead.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Most of the MM’s sample encounters are assorted troglodytes, though sometimes
they’ll have a rage drake or some gricks as pets. There’s also one that includes
drow and a gaggle of troglodyte warriors.</p>

<p>Narratively, it feels like Troglodytes flesh the Underdark out a little bit, but
the way the books refer to them does them no favors. In the end I feel like
using them in a subterranean campaign mostly so I can defy their awful canonical
description, which I guess is something.</p>

<p>Mechanically, most of their statistics are interchangeable with those of other
humanoids. Replace their signature abilities with darkvision and the stench
aura, and you have an instant novelty troglodyte. The reverse is also true.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/01/08/how-i-started.html">How I Started Role-Playing</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Lich van Winkle has <a href="https://lichvanwinkle.blogspot.com/2021/01/how-you-started.html">a post in his blog</a> where asks people how they started
role-playing. I figured I’d answer that here!</p>

<p>Before I start, it’s worth noting that I’m Brazilian, so my story is going to be
a bit different than that of most people reading this blog. I also grew up in
the state of Mato Grosso, which in the 80’s and 90’s meant “far out in the
boonies” as far as RPGs were concerned. Most of my acquisitions happened during
trips to visit family in Curitiba, a bigger city in another state.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The year you began, and with which role-playing game</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Did you figure it out alone, or were you introduced by a lone but
experienced GM, or by joining a preexisting group?</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>My first contact with the concept of role-playing games actually happened
through Choose Your Own Adventure books. Y’know, those books that had a couple
hundred numbered sections and directed you to different numbers based on your
decisions. There were a bunch of those in my school library, which was a small
miracle since that library only had like four bookshelves. This was 1991 or so,
which means I was 9.</p>

<p>Later on I’d convince my parents to buy me similar books - my first Fighting
Fantasy titles, in their Brazilian editions. These were more complex, with an
actual character sheet and die rolling. I remember this book from some other
series, where you played Robin Hood, and which had a combat system complex
enough to rival AD&amp;D.</p>

<p>My first actual RPG experience was around 1994, with a version of Basic D&amp;D that
was translated by a company named Grow, and packaged as a board game. I think it
might have been a boxed set as well in the US - it was the one with Zanzer Tem’s
dungeon on it, and had rules for PCs of up to level 5.</p>

<p>Shortly after that I got into GMing, and my games of choice were Tagmar (a
Brazilian-made fantasy game) and later a very badly translated Shadowrun 2nd
Edition. I also got familiar with GURPS and Storyteller at around this time,
though I didn’t play them regularly. In 1996 I went on a one-month student
exchange trip to the UK, and came back with a backpack full of Shadowrun
supplements in English.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>What was your first group like? Was it private among friends, in a game
store, or in a club? Were they older, younger than you? Did their style of
play shape the way you played later?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The group was my brother and a couple of other friends. Almost everyone was
around the same age as me (except for my brother, who was a bit younger). We
usually played at my home, and I’d say my style of play shaped theirs more
than the other way around, since I was always the GM.</p>

<p>I think I was the only one out of that bunch who kept being a part of the
hobby once we split, though. Dunno if that speaks well or badly of my GMing
skills.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Your favorite role-playing game. (Was it the game you started with?)</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s GURPS, and it’s not the one I started with. Lately I’ve also taken a</p>

<p>huge liking to Lancer.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Anything else you want to share reflecting the impact of how you started on
how you play(ed).</li>
</ol>

<p>Despite being from a different country and having ready access to a very small
pool of games when compared to someone from the US, my experience bears some
striking similarities with Lich van Winkle’s in that D&amp;D was a very small part
of my formative experience. I remember finding its many arbitrary limitations
very confining, so I spent most of my time in other games that didn’t have
them. Though some of those limitations have been removed, a lot of them still
remain in the game’s latest edition.</p>

<p>Tieflings rose to prominence during 2e, and were added as a playable option
right in the Fourth Edition PHB, though they’re a little different from their
previous incarnations here. As opposition, they’re featured in both the Monster
Manual and the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in other entries, Nerath is only the latest empire to fall in the
long story of the 4e setting. One of the many others that preceded it was the
human empire of Bael Turath, which fought for supremacy with the dragonborn
realm of Arkhosia a long time ago.</p>

<p>There came a time when Bael Turath was engulfed in turmoil, both because of that
war and because of its own decadence. In a desperate bid to retain control, its
leadership made sinister pacts with the forces of Hell. This worked for a time,
but it only delayed the final fall of the empire. Things turn ugly when both the
human nobles and the devils tried to break their side of the bargain. In the
end, both Bael Turath and Arkhosia met their end.</p>

<p>One of the effects of that diabolic compact was that the humans of Bael Turath
had their bodies infused with infernal power, transforming them into the
tieflings we know today. This transformation is hereditary and it persisted even
after the compact was broken and the empire fell. Today tiefling communities are
spread all over the world, either mixed in with larger multi-species settlements
or in small enclaves of their own, similar to dragonborn.</p>

<p>In addition to their distinctive looks, they retain a tiny bit of infernal
power. Both these things give them a bad reputation among other sapients, but
the truth is that modern tieflings are no more disposed to evil than any other
people. A tiefling could be a great champion of good just as they could choose
to embrace their bad rep and become evil diabolists.</p>

<p>Tiefling looks are a lot more uniform here than they used to be in previous
editions: red skin, prominent horns, solid red orbs for eyes, and a thick
muscular tail. They look like a less extreme version of a legion devil (which is
hairless with clawed hands and hooves for feet in addition to the other traits).</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Tieflings are Medium Natural Humanoids, and all of them have low-light vision
and some degree of fire resistance. The MM stat blocks also have the same
<strong>Infernal Wrath</strong> power tiefling PCs get. This is a minor action encounter
power that gives them a +1 attack bonus and a damage bonus against someone who
just hit them. It’s a “revenge” booster, essentially. Like PCs, they also get +1
to hit bloodied targets.</p>

<p>Each book gives us two tiefling stat blocks. As is the case for all playable
humanoids, they can be of any alignment and could be used as allies or
enemies. However, all of them seem to lean into their infernal heritage at least
a bit, so even the good ones will have the same air of ambiguity around them as
the party’s infernal warlock.</p>

<h3 id="tiefling-fury-monster-vault">Tiefling Fury (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>This is a duelist type, and a Level 5 Soldier with 63 HP. Its speed is 6, and it
has all common tiefling traits with 10 fire resistance.</p>

<p>The fury fights with a <strong>longsword</strong> whose attacks mark for a turn, and if a
marked enemy shift it can use a <strong>Tail Trip</strong> (melee 1 vs. Reflex) as an
interrupt to knock them prone and make a free longsword attack against them. If
an enemy hits the fury, it can use a <strong>Defiant Curse</strong> as a free action to mark
them for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="tiefling-heretic-monster-manual">Tiefling Heretic (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>An infernal warlock. It’s Level 6 Artillery with 60 HP, all common MM traits,
and a fire resistance of 11.</p>

<p>The heretic fights with a <strong>dagger</strong> in melee, and with bolts of <strong>Balefire</strong> at
range that deal immediate and ongoing fire damage (save ends). Once per
encounter it can conjure a <strong>Serpent Curse</strong> on a target (ranged 10 vs. will),
causing illusory snakes to appear and deal both immediate and ongoing psychic
damage.</p>

<p>When hit by a melee attack, the heretic can use <strong>Cloak of Escape</strong> as an
at-will reaction to teleport 5 squares. It also has <strong>Infernal Wrath</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="tiefling-darkblade-monster-manual">Tiefling Darkblade (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>An assassin-type, and a Level 7 Lurker with 64 HP and fire
resistance 12. Darkblades fight with <strong>poisoned shortswords</strong> that allow a
secondary attack against Fortitude on a hit, doing ongoing poison damage (save
ends). They can use <strong>Cloak of Lurking</strong> (move action; recharge 6) to teleport 5
squares and become invisible.</p>

<p>It seems they don’t have any powers that allow them to do increased damage when
attacking from hiding or with CA, so they’re in effect slightly weaker
skirmishers.</p>

<h3 id="tiefling-occultist-monster-vault">Tiefling Occultist (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>Another infernal warlock! This one is a Level 8 Controller with 87 HP and fire
resistance 10.</p>

<p>Occultists fight in melee with a <strong>Hell Rod</strong> that does immediate and ongoing
fire damage (save ends). They attack at range with <strong>Soul Fire</strong> (area burst 1
within 10 vs. Reflex), which does no immediate damage. Instead it does 10
ongoing fire damage (save ends), and deals 10 psychic damage to the target if it
moves closer to the occultist on the target’s next action.</p>

<p>As a move action it can use <strong>Baleful Teleport</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will) to
teleport a target 10 squares and teleport itself to the square the target just
left.</p>

<p>If an enemy hits the occultist, it can use <strong>Fiery Transposition</strong> to deal 5
fire damage to all enemies in a close burst 3, and swap places with the enemy
that hit it.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters And Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter goes all in on the hellish imagery: 1 heretic, 1 darkblade,
2 cambion hellswords, and a succubus.</p>

<p>I like tieflings, though more as a playable race than as an enemy. The enemy
stat blocks work well enough, however, and could also represent human warlocks
or other similar baddies.</p>

<p>Treants are inspired by Tolkien’s ents and have been in the game since at least
the days of BECMI, and likely earlier. Here, they are both in the Monster Manual
and in the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Treants are indeed very similar to the ents we see in The Lord of the Rings:
they’re sapient tree-like creatures who live in primeval forests. The main
difference between them (especially in 4e) is that treants are a lot quicker to
arrive at decisions, and a lot angrier with trespassers.</p>

<p>Treants love the forests where they live, and act as their guardians. They
spend much of their extremely long lives in a dormant/meditative state in which
they’re pretty much indistinguishable from normal trees. In this state, they can
feel the general state of the surrounding forest and its creatures, and know
when it’s in distress. When that happens, they rise to defend it.</p>

<p>Though treants love their forest and its creatures, they hold no particular
regard for any outsiders. They’ll be friendly towards those who demonstrate the
proper respect for the wild, and violent towards anyone who has the temerity to
chop down trees or otherwise despoil their territory.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault goes a little further here, saying that treants view
civilization in much the same way “civilized” people view the untamed wild: a
source of danger best removed. Their prefer nature in its wildest and most
unspoiled state, and will work to protect their territories even from natural
disasters like floods or fires caused by lightning. They’ll ally with anyone who
shares their values and opposes their enemies. They’re also very easy to anger
(particularly when they feel they’ve been betrayed) and very hard to placate.</p>

<p>A treant’s most frequent allies are dryads, who share their general
disposition. Eladrin and other fey are often allies as well, though in this case
both sides tend to view each other more warily. You could even have a treant
protecting the lair of an orc tribe, as long as the orcs focus their destruction
outside of the treant’s domain.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Treants are Huge Fey Magical Beasts with the Plant keyword. They have low-light
vision, Forest Walk, and a <strong>Wooden Body</strong> trait that makes them take ongoing 5
fire damage (save ends) whenever an attack deals immediate fire damage to
them. The trait only gets a name in the Monster Vault, but is also present in
the MM versions. If the attack in question already does ongoing fire damage, I
guess this trait doesn’t stack with it.</p>

<p>Treants fight using a combination of their great strength with primal magic that
grants them a measure of control over their surroundings. They’re fairly smart
at Int 14, and though grumpy and aggressive they’re Unaligned.</p>

<h3 id="bramblewood-treant-monster-vault">Bramblewood Treant (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>Unlike the other treants, this one is “only” Large. It could be a younger
specimen, or a different species that inhabits forests with smaller trees. It’s
a Level 10 Soldier with 108 HP and all common treant traits. It has speed 8 and
a <strong>Bramble Branches</strong> aura (2) that turns the covered area into difficult
terrain.</p>

<p>The bramblewood treant attacks with Reach 2 <strong>slams</strong> that mark the target for a
turn, and can throw <strong>stones</strong> (Ranged 20 vs. AC) for some ranged damage. If an
enemy within 2 squares moves, the treant can use <strong>Entangling Branches</strong> (melee
2 vs. Reflex) as an interrupt and grab them with an escape DC of 18.</p>

<p>This treant is at the right level to pal around with most dryads, some of the
eladrin, or the banshrae.</p>

<h3 id="treant-both">Treant (Both)</h3>

<p>The basic model is Huge, and a Level 16 Elite Controller with 316 HP and all
common traits. Its land speed is 8, and it projects a <strong>Grasping Roots</strong> aura
(3) that makes the covered area difficult terrain for nonflying enemies.</p>

<p>It fights with powerful <strong>slams</strong>, and can use an <strong>Earthshaking Stomp</strong> (close
burst 2 vs. Fortitude) to do a bunch of damage and knock enemies prone. In the
Monster Manual this is an encounter power, and in the Monster Vault it recharges
if the attack misses every target.</p>

<p>The treant’s other trick is <strong>Awaken Forest</strong> (area burst 3 within 10 vs. AC),
which causes the vegetation in the area (trees included) to animate and attack
enemies within. In the MM this is an encounter power that creates a zone which
can be sustained with minor actions, and which makes new attacks against enemies
inside whenever the treant sustains it.</p>

<p>In the MV, it’s a simple at-will standard action attack, and it creates a zone
of difficult terrain that lasts either until the end of the encounter, or until
the treant uses this power again.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault version of the treant is by far the better one, since it has
updated damage values and is also a better controller. Other than “use fire”,
there isn’t much you can do to get the upper hand over it, since it can make
solid attacks and impair movement both in melee and at range. Treants pair
really well with other creatures that have the Forest Walk ability.</p>

<h3 id="treant-grove-guardian-monster-vault">Treant Grove Guardian (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>I guess this is the sort of creature you can find guarding a powerful druid’s
home base. It’s a Level 18 Brute with 212 HP and all common treant traits. Its
speed is 8.</p>

<p>Grove guardians are all about physical combat. Their basic attack is a Reach 3
<strong>Sweeping Slam</strong> that can target one or two creatures, damaging and knocking
them prone on a hit. Once per encounter they can perform a maneuver called
<strong>Stump Stomp</strong>, in which they move their speed, can enter other creature’s
spaces, and make a sweeping slam attack against each creature whose space they
enter.</p>

<h3 id="blackroot-treant-both">Blackroot Treant (Both)</h3>

<p>This is an <em>undead</em> treant. You know those haunted forests where the trees seem
to have evil faces? These guys are those trees. Unlike living treants they’re
actively Evil, and actually a bit smarter at Int 16.</p>

<p>Blackroot treants are Huge Level 19 Elite Soldiers with 368 HP and all common
treant traits. They have Speed 6 and the Undead keyword in addition to being
Plants. They project a <strong>Killing Roots</strong> aura (2) which does 10 necrotic damage
to enemies caught inside.</p>

<p>Their Reach 3 <strong>slams</strong> also do ongoing necrotic damage (save ends), and mark the target
for a turn. They have <strong>Double Attack</strong>, and so can use two of those per
action. As a minor action they can use <strong>Entangling Roots</strong> (melee 4 vs. Reflex)
to knock someone prone and restrain them.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual version is a less powerful, since it lacks Double Attack, its
slams don’t mark, and the effect of Entangling Roots ceases if the treant gets
more than 4 squares away from the target. Always use the MV version if
possible. Used well, they can keep most of the party locked down tight, since
they can use Entangling Roots 1-3 times per turn and have no limit to the number
of people they can keep restrained.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h3>

<p>The MM sample encounter is level 19 and all about that haunted forest vibe: 1
blackroot treant, 2 slaughter wights, and 2 sword wraiths.</p>

<p>I like treants, even though this iteration of them is a bit more aggressive than
I would like. Mechanically speaking, the MV versions are clearly superior to the
MM originals, and you should use them whenever possible.</p>
