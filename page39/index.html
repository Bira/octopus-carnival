<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Felldrakes are a Vale-specific new addition to the game.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Shortly after signing the pact that transformed them, the ruling nobility of
Bael Turath set about applying their newfound infernal power in several ways
they felt would benefit the empire. One of the things they did was magically
alter the many breeds of drake the Turathi already employed to make them
stronger and more vicious. These magically altered breeds became known as
felldrakes.</p>

<p>Though felldrakes are considered natural animals, they’re much more aggressive
and territorial than other species and are susceptible to control via old
Turathi techniques and infernal magic. The Fell Court from our previous entry
was taught the secret of controlling these creatures by their diabolical
patrons. It’s possible other groups have learned it as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Like other drakes, these are Natural Beasts. They’re a varied lot, though, and
their abilities are specific to each stat block.</p>

<h3 id="leaping-felldrake">Leaping Felldrake</h3>

<p>This Small drake looks like a green-scaled lizard. As the name implies they’re
capable of long flying leaps, but they’re also pretty good at lying in
ambush. Their jaws are very efficient at biting the necks of their victims, and
their saliva contains a weak venom that turns the flesh around the bite mark
blue. They were used to protect homes and vaults from burglars, and those blue
marks aided in tracking any culprits that escaped.</p>

<p>Leaping Felldrakes are Level 1 Lurkers with 26 HP. They have ground and climb
speeds of 6. Their basic <strong>bites</strong> are a little weak, but they can use <strong>Neck
Bites</strong> against targets granting them combat advantage. This deals about double
the damage of a basic bite and allow the drake to grab the target (escape DC
12), dealing them ongoing 5 damage while the grab lasts.</p>

<p>The drake’s <strong>Flying Leaps</strong> allow them to fly 3 squares without provoking
opportunity attacks. If they have cover, concealment, or no enemies within 5
squares, they can use <strong>Instant Camouflage</strong> to become effectively invisible
until they attack or cancel the effect. That’s how it gains combat advantage in
most situations, though flanking also works fine in a fight against multiple
monsters.</p>

<h3 id="crested-felldrakes">Crested Felldrakes</h3>

<p>These Small drakes are kinda like a cross between a standard <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/01/27/drakes.html">guard drake</a>
and a Jurassic Park raptor. They’re pack hunters like unmodified guard drakes,
but they’re stronger and smarter than then. Crested felldrakes have been known
to climb on top of one another to reach high places, or to open doors with their
claws to get at victims on the other side.</p>

<p>Crested Felldrakes are Level 2 Skirmishers with 39 HP. They have a ground speed
of 8 and their <strong>Pack Frenzy</strong> trait gives them +1 to hit and +2 to damage when
adjacent to a felldrake ally. Their <strong>bites</strong> damage and allow a felldrake ally
within 2 squares of the attacker to shift up to 2 squares as a reaction. When
hit by an opportunity attack, they can automatically shift 2 squares. This
doesn’t negate the damage from the attack, but it also doesn’t use up an action,
so it can be done as often as you like. The more you hit them, the more mobile
they are.</p>

<h3 id="hissing-felldrake">Hissing Felldrake</h3>

<p>Another Jurassic Park-inspired monstrosity, this is a Medium drake with a large
folding frill around its neck and the ability to spit a corrosive venom laced
with soporific chemicals. It’s Level 3 Artillery with 38 HP.</p>

<p>They can <strong>bite</strong> but the star of the show is clearly their <strong>Fell Spit</strong>, a
ranged attack that targets Reflex and deals acid damage. If the target is
bloodied, they become slowed for a turn. If they’re already slowed, they instead
become dazed (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="tri-horned-felldrake">Tri-Horned Felldrake</h3>

<p>The larger and most aggressive of the felldrake subspecies, but also oddly
enough the easiest to domesticate. The Turathi enforced an instinctive pecking
order with tri-horns at the top, so they have some ability to control other
felldrake species.</p>

<p>Tri-horns are Medium Level 4 Soldiers with 58 HP. They have a speed of 5, are
immmune to fear, and gain a +3 to damage when charging. They can <strong>bite</strong> and
also perform <strong>challenging gores</strong> that deal about the same damage and mark for
a turn. If a marked target makes an attack that doesn’t target the drake, it can
use a melee reaction to automatically deal light damage and knock them prone.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The origin of the felldrakes gives you ample excuse to have a wild pack of them
that attacks on sight and fights to the death, unlike most natural
beasts. However they really come into their own as pets to the Fell Court or to
other similar groups that know how to control and boost them in the same way.</p>

<p>They could also be used as additional Dark Drake species to go with the Dark
Drake of the Moon Hills. Maybe the Dark Drake is a supernaturally powerful
felldrake who survives since the days of Bael Turath?</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>We just looked at a faction of Arkhosian revivalists, and now we’re looking at
an example of their Turathi counterparts.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Even long after the fall of Bael Turath, tieflings still have to contend with
the suspicions and prejudice of others. You could argue such suspicion was
warranted right after that fall, since the people who became the first tieflings
had all been members of the Turathi elite, and therefore quite nasty
slave-holding diabolists. Their descendants however were just born that way and
are as varied in their moral outlook as any other sapient people. It is wrong to
expect them to be scheming diabolists just because of their looks.</p>

<p>And then you have people like the Fell Court, who keep the stereotype alive by
living up to it. They’re a group of tieflings based on Fallcrest who want to
Make Bael Turath Great Again. Their leader is one Melech Ambrose, a
self-proclaimed general and visionary who can trace his ancestry very precisely
to a specific noble lineage.</p>

<p>Despite all his claims, Ambrose acts more like a petty crime lord than as a
would-be ruler. His group’s current activities are all aimed at filling their
“war chest” so the “real” takeover can begin. They have only recently stepped up
their operations, and though the Lord Warden of Fallcrest has heard rumors, his
men have so far failed to turn up any concrete information about the Court.</p>

<p>Ambrose himself has a public life as a successful trader and contacts among
several members of Fallcrest’s high society. He uses this as cover to run a
modest black market operation that enjoys the favor of many of the city’s
poorest residents, since they operate in the slums and provide some of the
support and security the city’s government can’t or won’t get them.</p>

<p>Most of the Court’s operating budget comes from Melech Ambrose’s criminal
enterprise. They’ve stepped up their recruitment efforts, and are setting up
caches of weapons and supplies for a future takeover of Fallcrest. The money
also sees good use gathering information about the city’s defenses and blackmail
material for use against its officials.</p>

<p>As you would expect from such a fan of old Bael Turath, Melech is a diabolist,
and his dealings have got him a measure of supernatural support from infernal
patrons. This include control over a large pack of Felldrakes, a species of
vicious drakes that used to be bred in Bael Turath.</p>

<p>Recruitment happens through a couple of layers of deception. The Court stages a
“false flag” attack on a potential candidate, and then swoops in for the
rescue. A member of the “rescue team” befriends the target and then the Court
slowly brings them into the group while probing their potential and loyalty to
the Turathi cause. A member who looks like a good fit gets contacted by an
underboss, who gives them a “trial by fire” mission that consists of committing
a crime suited to their abilities that also advances the interests of the
Court. Those who prove the extent of their skill and loyalty by successfully
performing this mission are made full members of the Court. Those who reveal
themselves incompatible end up murdered in a way that points to one of the
Court’s rivals.</p>

<p>All of that is for tieflings. Non-tieflings never really progress beyond the
stage of “disposable tool”.</p>

<p>Melech has also heard of the Iron Circle, an Asmodeus-worshiping mercenary
company from the south who is entering the Vale through the Harkenwold
region. He believes he can enter an alliance with them, offering his Fell
Court’s services as spies and saboteurs and using the Circle’s military might to
conquer the Vale so they can rule together. Though he has yet to hear back from
them after making his initial diplomatic overtures, he’s absolutely sure they
will be successful. This belief may lead him to act rashly.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>All of our stat blocks here are for tiefling members of the Fell Court. As such
they all have Low-Light Vision and Resist Fire 5. They tend to me at low-to-mid
Heroic levels, making them appropriate as your group’s first “urban intrigue”
antagonists in Fallcrest.</p>

<p>Let’s look at them in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="fell-court-ruffian">Fell Court Ruffian</h3>

<p>Ruffians are the some of the lowest-ranking members of the Court, individuals
who probably have not undergone their trial by fire yet. They’re Level 2 Minion
Brutes. They fight with <strong>clubs</strong> that deal half damage on a miss, and have a
<strong>Dances with Drakes</strong> ability that allows them to make a free attack against an
enemy that has just been hit by a drake ally.</p>

<h3 id="fell-court-creep">Fell Court Creep</h3>

<p>The same ranking as a Ruffian, but sneakier. Creeps are Level 3 Minion
Skirmishers. Their basic attack is a <strong>Dazing Dagger</strong> that damages and dazes
for a turn, and when they’re missed by an attack <strong>Fiendish Shift</strong> allows them
to shift 1 square and deal 3 fire damage to the target.</p>

<h3 id="fell-court-blackheart">Fell Court Blackheart</h3>

<p>A seasoned Court operative, combining mundane stealth training with a side of
infernal magic. They’re Level 2 Lurkers with 37 HP.</p>

<p>Blackhearts fight with <strong>Deadly Sickles</strong> that deal necrotic damage, and can
spend their action to assume a <strong>Smoke Form</strong> instead of attacking. While in
smoke form, they can’t attack or be attacked, and can pass through and occupy
other creatures’ spaces. It can revert as a free action, or when it drops to 0
HP (from ongoing damage or something).</p>

<p>If the blackheart starts its turn in smoke form, it can use a <strong>Sly Attack</strong> to
target Reflex and deal about double the damage of a basic attack, half on a
miss. It can also use this power without turning to smoke, but it doesn’t do
double damage then.</p>

<p>They can use the tiefling’s standard <strong>Infernal Wrath</strong> power to inflict a bit
of fire damage on someone who just hit them, and when they’re reduced to 0 HP
they can delete a healing surge from an enemy they can see before dropping.</p>

<p>If the blackheart damages an enemy that was granting combat advantage to it,
they stop that enemy from spending healing surges (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="fell-court-underboss">Fell Court Underboss</h3>

<p>This veteran Court member has proven to be loyal enough to be promoted, and is
now in charge of recruiting new members and sending them on jobs. It’s a Level 3
Soldier with 47 HP and the Leader keyword.</p>

<p>The underboss is a <strong>Drake Wrangler</strong>, and gives Resist Fire 5 and a +2 bonus to
the AC of any drakes adjacent to it. It also projects a <strong>Hellbound</strong> aura (1)
that deals 5 fire damage to any creature that leaves it. Its <strong>bastard sword</strong>
strikes kind of skip the whole marking business. A target hit by the sword
suffers 5 fire damage if it doesn’t target the underboss with an attack during
their next turn.</p>

<p>They can also use the sword in a <strong>Diabolical Strike</strong> that deals fire damage
and, if the attack was made with combat advantage, prevents the target from
shifting for a turn. <strong>Infernal Wrath</strong> rounds out the tiefling’s arsenal.</p>

<p>Underbosses will always be in a tight formation with a pack of drakes, and will
seek to stay adjacent to a PC. Scattering those drakes might be a useful tactic,
since they’d take damage from Hellbound.</p>

<h3 id="fell-court-hellmage">Fell Court Hellmage</h3>

<p>An underboss-rank Court member who prefers to rely more on magic than on
swords. It’s Level 4 Artillery with 42 HP and the Leader keyword. Its aura of
<strong>Drake Regeneration</strong> (3) causes any bloodied drake ally inside to recover 5 HP
at the start of their turns if they have at least one HP left.</p>

<p>Hellmages fight with <strong>daggers</strong> in melee and shoot <strong>Infernal Bolts</strong> at
range. These deal both immediate and ongoing fire and radiant damage. Infernal
Wrath works as standard for them, and when they drop to 0 HP they use <strong>See you
In Hell</strong> to fire off one last infernal bolt without provoking opportunity
attacks.</p>

<h3 id="melech-ambrose">Melech Ambrose</h3>

<p>The big boss is a unique Level 5 Skirmisher with 68 HP and the Leader
keyword. As a regular, Melech will always have plenty of bodyguards and
felldrakes with him. He projects two auras: <strong>Bloodthirsty</strong> (radius 1) makes
all enemies inside grant combat advantage; and <strong>Drake Fervor</strong> (radius 3) gives
drake allies inside a +2 bonus to damage and to saves.</p>

<p>Melech himself fights with a <strong>scimitar</strong>, which can be used for basic attacks
or <strong>Fiendish Strikes</strong> that allow him to shift 2 squares before or after the
attack, and, if made with combat advantage, daze for a turn. He can also <strong>hurl
flame</strong> to strike at range, dealing fire damage. Infernal Wrath works as normal
for him.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think it’s a bit unfortunate that the Fell Court lives up to the bad
reputation tieflings have, but it does give heroic PC tieflings an extra reason
to fight them. The first time I read this entry, I thought it was odd that they
went into that much detail about their recruitment process, but it’s a perfect
ready-made story hook to get one of those heroic PC tieflings involved with
them.</p>

<p>Any fight against Fell Court members should absolutely include a couple of fell
drakes at least. Another thing I hadn’t noticed until now is how central drakes
are to their whole flavor - every stat block here has some interaction with
drake allies. A “final battle” encounter against Melech, an Underboss, a
Hellmage and a troop of drakes will have the latter punch above their weight
class with bonuses to AC, damage, saves, and regeneration.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This is another setting-specific group.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Dythan’s Legion is a large all-dragonborn military organization. As the name
implies, their leader is Legatus Dythan, an ambitious and charismatic leader who
dreams of seeing Arkhosia restored to its ancient glory, presumably with him at
the top.</p>

<p>The Legion uses the same ranks and organization as the ancient armies of
Arkhosia, and numbers about 500 members in total, usually operating in platoons
of 20 to 24 people. These are supported by war-trained drakes and behemoths, and
sometimes even by salvaged Arkhosian battle constructs.</p>

<p>Upon admission into the Legion, every member is branded with a symbol that used
to be a Turathi slave marking. Dythan’s ancestors in the Drakerider clan used to
live in the border between Arkhosia and Bael Turath, and were taken captive in a
Turathi raid. After they were freed or escaped their enslavement, they took the
mark for their own as a reminder of what Arkhosia was fighting against, and
passed it onto their descendants. Dythan himself bears such a mark, and makes
sure his soldiers remember as he does.</p>

<p>Though the Legion usually operates far south of the Vale, a contingent of them
arrived here recently looking for ruins of Arkhosian outposts that are said to
have been here back in the old days. One of them, Rolaz-Gaar, is somewhere along
the shores of Lake Nen (in the NE corner of the Vale). Another might be
somewhere beneath the Ogrefist Hills near the Vale’s western border. The Legion
detachments concentrate in these two locations.</p>

<p>Despite being fairly small when compared to those ancient imperial armies, the
Legion is still a large force by the standards of our narrative present, and its
members are well-trained and well-equipped professionals. They’re not interested
in conquering the Vale, but they’re unlikely to be very nice to anyone who
stands in the way of their search. It’s unclear from the text whether Dythan
himself is in the Vale at the moment. If the GM judges the ruins contain
something really important, then he’s likely to be here overseeing the searches
personally. If he’s not, a sufficient challenge to the Legion’s operations in
the area might result in him appearing with reinforcements.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The actual people who make up the legion are all dragonborn, and their elite
training places them as early Paragon threats. We also get stats for their
salvaged Arkhosian siege towers, and for the Liondrakes they use as mounts. They
use other drakes and behemoths in various roles, but those use the base
stats for these creatures, perhaps leveled-up to match their handlers.</p>

<p>As dragonborn, all members of Dythan’s Legion can use <strong>Dragon Breath</strong>, which
like the PC version is an encounter power that lets them breathe energy in a
Close Burst 3 vs. Reflex. The damage type varies per stat block, and can be
changed to match specific individuals. They also have Speed 6, and the
non-minions have the PC trait that gives them +1 to hit while bloodied.</p>

<p>Alignment-wise, every dragonborn here including Dythan has the Evil alignment,
which paints us an interesting picture combined with the slave marking story in
the Lore section. You could perhaps see them as greedy and ruthless imperialists
who are nevertheless vehemently against slavery in all its forms. It would also
be relatively easy to say they focus on the less-bad parts of Arkhosia’s past
and make them Unaligned. Making them actively heroic is more of a stretch, I
feel, and would require bigger changes to their background.</p>

<p>Like we did with the Daggerburg goblins, we’ll look at them in order of
increasing level.</p>

<h3 id="dythans-legion-warrior">Dythan’s Legion Warrior</h3>

<p>The rank and file of the Legion is made up of these veteran soldiers. They’re
Level 10 Minion Skirmishers wearing leather armor and carrying heavy
shields. They fight with spears in melee, and can throw javelins at range.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Phalanx Formation</strong> trait gives them an extra +1 AC per adjacent ally,
up to a maximum of +4. This would be a big no-no on a regular monster (remember
MM1 hobgoblins?) but it’s OK to have on a minion since you only need to hit them
once.</p>

<p>The <strong>Spear</strong> Attack deals a bit of extra damage when they have combat
advantage, and allows the warrior to shift 1 square before or after the
attack. The <strong>Javelin</strong> is a standard ranged attack. Their breath is lightning.</p>

<p>PCs are unlikely to meet legionnaires in numbers smaller than a platoon, and
this stat block helps fill out those numbers without making the encounter
impossible. They can be easily made into regulars if you need more powerful
infantry for an encounter.</p>

<h3 id="dythans-legion-archer">Dythan’s Legion Archer</h3>

<p>These are battlefield archers, so they’re trained to put a lot of arrows into a
group of clustered targets. They’re Level 10 Artillery with 84 HP. The <strong>short
sword</strong> and <strong>Longbow</strong> basic attacks are solid, with the latter being the
better option. They can also fire an <strong>Arrow Volley</strong> (recharge 4+) that targets
enemies in an Area Burst 1 within 20 squares and does light physical damage to
each one it hits.</p>

<p>Their <strong>dragon breath</strong> deals cold damage and also pushes 1 square on a hit,
making it a good “keep-away” emergency power.</p>

<h3 id="dythans-legion-vanguard">Dythan’s Legion Vanguard</h3>

<p>Vanguards march into battle at the front of the Legion’s infantry formations,
engaging the enemy directly to give space for the mobile Warriors to flank
them. They’re Level 11 Soldiers with 111 HP, wear plate, and carry swords and
heavy shields.</p>

<p>They have the same <strong>Phalanx Formation</strong> trait as the Warriors, which means they
punch above far above their weight as far as AC is concerned. If you can’t
isolate them from their allies, hit them in the non-armor defenses!</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>Longsword</strong> attack marks for a turn on a hit, and they can use
minor actions to <strong>shield bash</strong> marked targets. This does no damage, but dazes
for a turn. <strong>Vanguard’s Mark</strong> (recharge when first bloodied) allows them to
mark a target that’s up to 5 squares away with a minor action. If the marked
target doesn’t end their next turn adjacent to the vanguard, the vanguard can
charge it as a free action that doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. This makes
the power an excellent way to hit the PC’s squishies.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Dragon Breath</strong> does poison damage.</p>

<h3 id="dythans-legion-dragoon">Dythan’s Legion Dragoon</h3>

<p>Real-world dragoons were so named because they were cavalry that carried
firearms (so their weapons “spat fire”). The dragoons of Dythan’s Legion got
this name from the fact that they ride the next best thing to an actual dragon.</p>

<p>Dragoons are Level 12 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 119 HP. They wear
leather like the infantry, and carry <strong>lances</strong> into combat. Most of their
abilities are related to mounted combat. The <strong>Masterful Rider</strong> trait negates 1
square of all forced movement imposed upon them if they’re mounted; the
<strong>Incensed Mount</strong> reaction allows their mount to make a free basic attack
against an enemy who damages the rider; and even their basic lance attack knocks
prone on a hit if the dragoon is mounted.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Battlefield Mastery</strong> power (recharge 4+) is a minor action that allows
every ally in a Close Burst 2 to shift 1 square. And yeah, the mount is an
ally. Their <strong>Dragon Breath</strong> does acid damage.</p>

<p>Dragoons are quite dangerous when mounted! Canny PCs will seek to knock them
down and prevent them from remounting again.</p>

<h3 id="liondrake">Liondrake</h3>

<p>Captured young in the distant deserts of the south, these Large Natural Beasts
are the mount of choice for Dythan’s Dragoons. They look a lot like dragons, and
have many of the same attacks, but are not sapient and lack breath weapons. The
specimen statted up here has been trained as a war mount and is a Level 12
Skirmisher with 122 HP. It has a ground speed of 7, a fly speed of 10, and
Darkvision.</p>

<p>The drake’s <strong>Fierce Mount</strong> trait gives both it and its rider a +4 bonus to
defenses against opportunity attacks. It has both a <strong>bite</strong> and a <strong>claw</strong> as
basic attacks, and can perform <strong>Battle Leaps</strong> that allow it to shift up to 4
squares and then either bite once or claw twice. It has a <strong>Terrifying Roar</strong>
encounter power that is kinda like dragon breath, targeting a Close Blast 5,
doing thunder damage, and dazing (save ends).</p>

<p>Liondrakes are dangerous even on their own, but they synergize very well with
Dragoons. They also make great mounts for other kinds of paragon-tier “rider”
opponents.</p>

<h3 id="arkhosian-siege-tower">Arkhosian Siege Tower</h3>

<figure class="left">

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These are ancient constructs built by Arkhosia and salvaged by the Legion. They
were either brought to the vale from the South, or salvaged from local Arkhosian
ruins depending on how you want to play it in your campaign. They are 30-foot
tall and 15-foot wide stone towers that move on 10-foot tall granite rollers.</p>

<p>A tower can transport troops in its two internal floors, allowing them to
disembark on enemy battlements. On top of it is a sculpted dragon head that can
swivel in a 360-degree arc and shoot fireballs at enemies. Being a construct,
the tower is capable of driving and shooting by itself, though if it gets too
damaged its occupants will dearly feel the lack of internal safety equipment.</p>

<p>Arkosian Siege Towers are Huge Natural Animates with the Construct keyword and
336 HP. They’re immune to charm, disease, and poison, and have Resist 15 to all
damage originating from outside themselves. The rest of their stat block really
stretches the format in an attempt to model all they can do, starting with a
trio of very interesting traits:</p>

<p><strong>All-Around Vision</strong> means they don’t grant combat advantage when flanked;
<strong>Juggernaut</strong> means it ignores difficult terrain and doesn’t provoke
opportunity attacks, but it also can’t squeeze, make OAs, or grab
creatures. <strong>Living Building</strong> has a list of effects as long as my arm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The tower can occupy other creature’s spaces, and other creatures can end
their movement in its spaces. That’s rules-talk for “it can fit people inside
itself”. When it moves, creatures inside move along with it as if it was a
vehicle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tower is 30 feet tall and has two internal 15-foot tall levels. The
Athletics DC for climbing it from the outside is 20.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The lower level has two iron double doors (break DC 25) that it can open and
close as a free action. When the doors are closed, there is no line of sight
or effect between the inside and outside.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The upper level has arrow slits that allow occupants to shoot outside. It’s
linked to the lower level by 2 ladders.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the <strong>Rough Ride</strong> trait models how damage impacts the tower. While
bloodied, the tower is slowed and inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks on all its
occupants.</p>

<p>As a construct, the tower has two attacks. The <strong>Dragon’s Head</strong> shoots
fireballs (Area 1 within 20) that deal immediate and ongoing fire damage, half
on a miss. And it can <strong>Crush</strong> with its move action, which allows it to make
attacks against any creatures whose spaces it enters during the move.</p>

<p>When the tower drops to 0 HP, it <strong>Collapses</strong>, making an attack vs. the Reflex
of every occupant that deals heavy damage and knocks them prone on a hit. The
tower’s space becomes difficult terrain (a giant pile of rubble!).</p>

<p>The stats make no mention of a disembarking ramp on the second level, but it’s
easy to say there is one there. It’d be as sturdy as the ground floor doors, and
controlled in the same way.</p>

<p>The best way to fight a siege tower is from inside, where you can bypass its DR
and “only” have to contend with its occupants. These are likely to be a
combination of vanguards and archers.</p>

<h3 id="legatus-dythan">Legatus Dythan</h3>

<p>Dythan is big and imposing even for a Dragonborn. He wears an ornate suit of
plate adorned with Arkhosian heraldic devices done in gold inlay. He’s not just
a competent general, but an extremely skilled combatant as well.</p>

<p>Dythan is a Level 15 Elite Soldier with 290 HP and the Leader keyword. He wears
his nifty armor suit and carries a shield, a sword and a brace of javelins into
battle. He has the same <strong>Phalanx Formation</strong> trait as his vanguards, and
projects a <strong>Last Stand</strong> aura (5) that gives allies inside a +2 bonus to damage
while they’re bloodied. He also gains at +2 to hit while bloodied himself,
instead of the usual +1 for dragonborn.</p>

<p>Dythan might be a Soldier but he doesn’t mark anyone. Instead he wants the PCs
to mark him! His <strong>longsword</strong> deals bonus damage if the target is marking
Dythan or has an active defender aura. If an enemy marks an ally within 5
squares of Dythan, he can use <strong>Dythan’s Challenge</strong> to transfer the mark to
himself.</p>

<p>As a minor action he can perform a <strong>Shield Bash</strong>, which damages, pushes 1
square, and allows the legate to shift 1 square to follow. This is a full attack
with standard damage because he’s an elite. Those javelins are <strong>Shock
Javelins</strong> that deal lightning damage. And finally, his <strong>Dragon Breath</strong> is the
traditional fire.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I really like Dythan’s Legion. They’re a major threat compared to almost
everything else in the Vale, but they’re focused on doing their own thing and
have no reason to be immediately hostile to the PCs.</p>

<p>Depending on how villainous you want to make them, they might make a good
late-game antagonist faction when they find those ancient ruins and start
bringing in their full numbers to the Vale looking to conquer it and make it
their new base of operations. They might also work as uneasy allies against
other Vale-wide threats, like a full-scale Bloodspear invasion or one of the big
dragons.</p>

<p>Another original monster!</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The largest human settlement in the Vale in our narrative present is the city of
Fallcrest, which is more or less exactly in its center and connected by roads to
the other major towns. It’s a big point of light, but the darkness starts just
beyond it. Those roads are dangerous, and even the areas just outside the city’s
walls contain their own threats.</p>

<p>Take the Moon Hills, for example, which are just to the south of the city. On
the blackest of nights, a fearsome beast is said to roam the hills and moors of
that region, hunting the unwary. No one has ever seen the Dark Drake and lived
to tell the tale - its existence is only known by the gruesome remains it leaves
behind.</p>

<p>The Dark Drake is in some ways Fallcrest’s pet monster, as it features in many
stories told in taverns or to children. These tales attribute all sorts of weird
abilities to it, and also talk about its extensive brood. These “lesser” drakes
<em>have</em> been frequently spotted in the area, and they’re also clearly more
dangerous and malignant than simple natural animals, but the Dark Drake itself
has remained elusive for decades, evading even experienced monster
hunters. Serious scholars dismiss it as just a myth. It doesn’t help that
opportunists from Fallcrest sometimes stage hoaxes to make a buck or cover up a
more mundane murder. Nevertheless, these smaller drakes and hoaxes can’t explain
<em>all</em> the bodies found on the Moon Hills.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The entries below assume that the Drake does indeed exist, and that it has some
connection to its “brood”. You are likely to find them together. They’re all
Natural Beasts with the Reptile keyword. As a reminder, “Natural” only means
it’s native to the middle world, and “Beast” means it looks and behaves like an
animal. We’re still dealing with a weird mystical creature here.</p>

<h3 id="dark-drake-of-the-moon-hills">Dark Drake of the Moon Hills</h3>

<p>The Drake itself is Large, and a Level 8 Elite Lurker with 148 HP. That’s a hell
of a thing to meet just outside the Vale’s premier “starting town”. It has
Darkvision and a speed of 6. Its basic <strong>Bite</strong> is quite strong for a lurker,
and it can use <strong>Double Attack</strong> to bite twice in an action. Instead of biting,
it can use the <strong>Ghost Drake</strong> ability to gain insubstantial and phasing for a
turn, move its speed, and then become invisible until the end of the encounter
or until after it makes an attack.</p>

<p>Being invisible allows the Dark Drake to use its <strong>Unseen Killer</strong> power, a
melee attack that targets Will and does heavy psychic damage - about double that
of a bite. It can also use its <strong>Terrible Aspect</strong> as a weapon, a minor-action
melee attack against Will that pushes the target 1 square and immobilizes them
for a turn. This recharges whenever the drake hits with any of its other
attacks.</p>

<p>The Dark Drake can sustain the same damage output whether it decides to stand
and fight or to employ the more lurkerish tactic of alternating Ghost Drake and
Unseen Killer. The latter is still a bit better since as a lurker its defenses
and HP are a bit low for its level.</p>

<h3 id="hellghost-dark-drake">Hellghost Dark Drake</h3>

<p>One of the two “dark brood” stat blocks we get in this entry. Hellghosts are
Large Natural Beasts and Level 6 Brutes with 85 HP. It has Darkvision, a Speed
of 8, and Fire Resistance 5. It projects an aura of <strong>Ghostfire Radiance</strong> (1)
that makes creatures inside Vulnerable 5 to fire. I wonder how that interacts
with a tiefling’s natural resistance.</p>

<p>The creature uses a <strong>Fiery Bite</strong> as its basic attack, which deals heavy fire
damage even before you account for the aura. Once per encounter it can use
<strong>Ghostfire Rampage</strong>, which is a standard “trample” ability: the drake moves
its speed and can cross enemy spaces. Every time it does so, it makes an attack
against that enemy. On a hit, it deals fire damage, knocks prone, and inflicts
ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Also once per encounter, when the drake is immobilized, restrained, or stunned,
it can use <strong>Pulsing Ghostfire</strong> to attack a Close Burst 2. On a hit it deals
fire damage and knocks the target prone, on a miss it still deals half damage.</p>

<h3 id="adderbrood-dark-drake">Adderbrood Dark Drake</h3>

<p>This one is highly venomous. It’s a Medium Natural Beast, and a Level 7
Skirmisher with 79 HP. Its <strong>bite</strong> deals poison damage and slows for a turn.
It can attack these slowed targets with a <strong>Venomous Strike</strong> that deals the
same amount of poison damage and inflicts ongoing poison damage (save
ends). After the first failed save, the victim also becomes immobilized. A
successful save clears both this and the ongoing damage.</p>

<p><strong>Adder’s Mobility</strong> ensures that enemies slowed or immobilized by the drake
cannot make opportunity attacks against it, and that the drake can enter their
spaces. So it can, say, bite a defender and move through them to reach the
squishies.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>The Drake’s lore sounds a bit commonplace at first, and its stats while
mechanically interesting are far from the most powerful thing we’ll see even in
this book… but the full impact of it all hits when you look at a map of the
Nentir Vale.</p>

<p>If you’re starting a campaign in the Nentir Vale, there’s a very high chance
that Fallcrest will be your PC’s starting home base. It’s big enough to offer
all the standard services, and it’s centrally located so they have plenty of
choice of where to adventure. The only reason not to start here is if the GM has
a more specific campaign or module in mind.</p>

<p>And the Moon Hills are right beside it, to the south. The road connecting
Fallcrest and the Harkenwold goes through them! If you still hold any notion of
D&amp;D being “like a MMO” that demands every fight be “fair” after reading this
far, this is where you drop them. A MMO would surround the starting town with
low-level trash enemies you can grind for levels. This book puts a level 8 elite
newbie-killer where those would be.</p>

<p>If deployed by a cruel GM against Level 1-2 players, the Drake is a terrifying
threat they must escape from. It can kill a PC in one round of attacks no matter
which approach it chooses. Against a party of experienced monster hunters who
are closer to it in level, you’ll want to deploy the Drake alongside some of its
brood to make a proper boss fight.</p>

<p>Goblins have always been in the game, as we already know. This is a specific
group of them operating in the southern regions of the Vale.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Between the Witchlight Fens and the Harken Forest, roughly on the south-central
region of the Vale, there is a hidden fort named Daggerburg. It belongs to a
large band of goblin brigands, who ride out of it to raid and pillage the
surrounding area. Their operation is quite successful because they’re far away
from the territories of more powerful monsters, and because their very diverse
membership has been extensively trained in guerrilla tactics by their leader
Delderosh.</p>

<p>The band also includes a number of remarkable individuals beyond Delderosh
himself. There’s Kabo Bomble, a massive bruiser nearly twice the size of a
typical goblin; and there are the Mistmane Bugbears, a cult who trains in a
fighting style that combines unarmed combat and necromantic magic.</p>

<p>Delderosh really hates enemy spellcasters and likes collecting their eyeballs as
trophies. He likes spellcasters just fine when they’re working for him, though,
which is why he’s allied to the necromancer Gokof (from the Cadaver Collector
entry) and has several war mages on his payroll.</p>

<p>The Daggerburg goblins have become more daring of late, and have been pushing
deeper into the Harkenwold region north of the Harken forest, even going so far
as to raid settlements. However they haven’t yet worked up the courage to strike
at the Woodsinger elves who also live in the same region.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The Daggerburg gang tends to be a cut above your standard MM/MV goblins, their
levels covering the latter half of the Heroic Tier instead of the earlier
one. Most of them also have at least one of the following signature abilities
representing their training:</p>

<p><strong>Combat Adept</strong> gives them a +1d10 damage bonus against enemies who haven’t yet
acted this combat. Anyone with this trait really likes rolling high for
initiative.</p>

<p><strong>Daggerburg Tactics</strong> replaces the generic Goblin Tactics trait. When a
creature with this is missed by a melee attack, the attacker grants combat
advantage to them in this next turn.</p>

<h3 id="battle-worg">Battle Worg</h3>

<p>The Daggerburg goblins raise a distinctive breed of giant wolf for use as mounts
in battle. Despite being called “battle worgs”, they’re not sapient like
standard worgs, and are a little weaker. Their mechanics are still similar,
though.</p>

<p>Battle Worgs are Large Natural Magical Beasts and Level 5 Brutes with 78 HP and
a speed of 8. Their <strong>Frigthful Growls</strong> acts as an aura (1) that inflicts a -1
to-hit penalty on enemies caught inside. Their mount trait is <strong>Slavering
Lunge</strong>, which lets the worg move half its speed as a free action when their
rider rolls initiative. Their reach 1 <strong>Bite</strong> damages and inflicts ongoing 5
damage (save ends).</p>

<p>A lot of the people who could use battle worgs as mounts in this entry are
higher level than them, but it’s a simple enough task to level up the worgs to
match their riders if you want them to last longer in the fight.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-ruffian">Daggerburg Ruffian</h3>

<p>An experienced raider, this goblin is a Level 4 Soldier with 58 HP and a speed
of 5. It’s armored in mail, wields a light shield and spear combo in melee, and
a light crossbow for ranged combat. It has both Combat Adept and Daggerburg
Tactics.</p>

<p>The <strong>spear</strong> and <strong>crossbow</strong> are used in basic attacks, and the spear can also
<strong>trip up</strong> an enemy, doing the same damage as a basic attack and knocking the
target prone.</p>

<p>Ruffians are perfect riders for the battle worgs we just saw.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-theurge">Daggerburg Theurge</h3>

<p>Theurges seem to be goblin spellcasters with a witchy theme. They’re Level 5
Controllers with 64 HP and both signature traits. They’re listed as Medium, but
should be Small instead.</p>

<p>They fight in melee with <strong>spiked clubs</strong>, and once per encounter they can call
down a <strong>Brimstone Rain</strong> that works as an area burst 2 attack. It deals
immediate and ongoing fire damage (save ends), half on a miss.</p>

<p>Their most fun power, however, is the at-will <strong>Slimy Transformation</strong>. Ranged 5
vs. Fortitude, does no damage, but <em>turns the target into a frog</em> (save ends)!
This is a mundane Tiny frog, not a giant variety. Frogged targets are considered
slowed, and can’t use powers - not even basic attacks. The only limitation here
is that the theurge can’t cast this on someone who’s already transformed by it.</p>

<p>So yeah, they are sure to open up with Brimstone Rain and then stay away
applying the Transformation to as many PCs as possible while their buddies do
the actual damage.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-war-mage">Daggerburg War Mage</h3>

<p>Another mage, this one a more straighforward hobgoblin elemental adept. It’s
Level 6 Artillery with 58 HP. They have Combat Adept but not Daggerburg Tactics.</p>

<p>War mages fight with their <strong>staffs</strong>, which also work as implements. At range
they can hit you with an at-will <strong>Stabbing Flame</strong> that does immediate and
ongoing fire damage, or with a recharge 5+ <strong>Icy Stream</strong> that does cold damage
and slides the target 3 squares.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-slayer">Daggerburg Slayer</h3>

<p>A beefy hobgoblin with a big axe. It’s a Level 6 Brute with 85 HP. It has Combat
Adept but not Daggerburg Tactics. Their <strong>greataxe</strong> is their sole attack, but
it has some riders: it deals +5 damage while the slayer is bloodied, and it
deals another +5 damage if the strike bloodies the target.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the slayer can use its <strong>Hobgoblin Resilience</strong> to
immediately roll a save against an (save ends) effect as a reaction.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-zealot">Daggerburg Zealot</h3>

<p>A bugbear trained with the glaive. Not one of the Mistmanes, those are
below. Zealots are Level 7 Skirmishers with 78 HP. They have Combat Adept.</p>

<p>The <strong>glaive</strong> is a solid Reach 2 basic attack and their <strong>Mobile Attack</strong>
ability allows them to shift half their speed and make a glaive attack at any
point during the movement. Once per encounter, when an enemy within 5 squares of
the zealot attacks one of its allies, the zealot can use <strong>Dagerburg Zealotry</strong>
shift up to 5 squares and hit the attacker with its glaive as a reaction.</p>

<p>A very mobile combatant with a reach weapon, who will use both of these things
to get at the party’s back lines and mess up their squishies.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-captain">Daggerburg Captain</h3>

<p>This hobgoblin officer probably serves directly under Delderosh. It’s a Level 7
Soldier (Leader) with 78 HP. The captain is clad in mail and wields a bastard
sword and a shield.</p>

<p>The <strong>bastard sword</strong> makes attacks that damage and mark for a turn. While the
mark persists, the target also grants combat advantage. Once per encounter, and
once again after it’s first bloodied, the captain can yell <strong>Follow Me!</strong> and
charge an enemy. Two allies within 5 squares of its starting position can then
make a free charge against different enemies.</p>

<p>The captain has none of the signature traits from the start of this
section. Instead, it has an improved version of Hobgoblin Resilience named
<strong>Daggerburg Resilience</strong>, which works the same but can be applied either to the
captain or to an ally within 5 squares of it.</p>

<h3 id="daggerburg-reaper">Daggerburg Reaper</h3>

<p>A hobgoblin who specializes in the use of the scythe. It’s a Level 7 Lurker with
64 HP. The <strong>scythe</strong> can make decent basic attacks, and once per encounter the
reaper can use a <strong>Blinding Sweep</strong> that targets a Close Burst 1, deals heavy
damage, and blinds for a turn on a hit. A miss does half damage.</p>

<p>As a move action, the reaper can <strong>Stalk</strong>, which allows it to shift 1 square
and then move its speed. If it ends in a space at least three squares from any
other creatures, it becomes invisible until the start of its next turn or until
it makes an attack.</p>

<p>These abilities are interesting but the reaper has no powers that specifically
exploit them. It’s a very skirmishery lurker.</p>

<h3 id="mistmane-bugbear">Mistmane Bugbear</h3>

<p>These bugbear adepts received their name from the constant misty aura they
project, which disrupts teleportation and can confuse enemies’ minds. Their
claws are laced with necromantic energy. They’re Large Natural Humanoids and
Level 8 Elite Soldiers with 172 HP.</p>

<p>They have Combat Adept, and their <strong>Arcane Mist</strong> aura (2) prevents creatures
from teleporting as mentioned above. Their basic attack is a <strong>Rake</strong> with their
claws, which damages and marks for a turn. If a marked enemy makes an attack
that doesn’t target the bugbear, they take 5 necrotic damage. As elites, they
can use this for <strong>Double Attacks</strong>.</p>

<p>Once per encounter as a minor action they can use the <strong>Bewildering Mist</strong>
ability, attacking the Will of every enemy in a Close Burst 1. A hit dazes the
target for a turn.</p>

<p>Mistmanes are excellent front-line fighters, able to keep two PCs marked at
once.</p>

<h3 id="kabo-bomble">Kabo Bomble</h3>

<p>One of the Daggerburg gang’s champions, Kabo Bomble is a giant of a goblin,
twice as tall as the typical member of the species. This puts him well into
Medium size. He fights with a morningstar in one hand and a spiked gauntlet in
the other. Kabo is a Level 9 Brute with 116 HP. He has both Combat Adept and
Daggerburg Tactics.</p>

<p>Kabo’s <strong>morningstar</strong> and <strong>gauntlet</strong> do about the same damage, with the first
being a basic attack and the second targetting Reflex and dazing for a turn on a
critical hit.</p>

<p>Twice per encounter, Kabo can use a <strong>Furious Attack</strong> ability to attack with
both weapons in a single action. If both hit the same target, it is dazed for a
turn.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, Kabo Bomble can <strong>Roar</strong> as a minor action, attacking the
Will of all enemies in a Close Burst 2 and inflicting a -2 defense penalty on a
hit (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="warlord-delderosh">Warlord Delderosh</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-daggerburg-delderosh.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Delderosh is the leader of the Daggerburg Goblins, and is likely to be found
leading their biggest raids or at the center of Daggerburg itself surrounded by
his personal guard. This hobgoblin is a Level 10 Skirmisher (Leader) with 200
HP.</p>

<p>Delderosh’s custom traits are <strong>Ambush Leader</strong>, which gives a +5 to the
Initiative rolls of every ally within 5 squares of him at the start of the
fight; and <strong>Combat Advantage</strong>, which gives him some bonus damage when he has
that against a target.</p>

<p>Delderosh carries a <strong>spear</strong> for fighting in melee and a <strong>shortbow</strong> for
ranged attacks. The spear attack allows him to shift 1 square as an effect and
it can be used to <strong>Skewer</strong> (recharge 5+), which deals the same damage as a
basic attack and inflicts ongoing 10 damage (save ends). As an effect, it also
makes the target grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>Finally, he has the same <strong>Daggerburg Resilience</strong> reaction power as the
Captains working under him.</p>

<p>The warlord is depicted riding a battle worg here and he would certainly benefit
from the thing’s traits, but you’ll likely need to increase the level of his
personal mount from the base 5. Everyone else in the encounter where he appears
should have Combat Adept to maximize the benefit they get from his initiative
bonus.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The Daggerburg goblins don’t differ much in concept from the “generic” band of
goblin brigands, but they’re a very nice worked example of the trope, with
several memorable named NPCs. They also show us how to stretch classic
goblinoids into a threat that can keep PCs occupied for the whole of the heroic
tier.</p>

<p>The band might get involved in factional conflicts with the Iron Circle, a
foreign mercenary army that has been moving into Harkenwold. And the druids of
Harken’s Heart would be among the groups they avoid. Both of these get their own
entries later on.</p>
