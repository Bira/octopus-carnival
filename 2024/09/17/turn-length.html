<p>A common complaint I hear about people who tried GURPS for the first time coming
in from other systems is that the “flow” of combat feels odd. Mainly that those
1-second turns are too short and don’t let you do enough. Sometimes also that
these short turns lead to fights that end too quickly to be dramatic<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I think this comes from a mismatch between the player’s learned expectations and
the way GURPS actually does things. In this post I’ll try to describe this
difference, and give a few suggestions on how to reduce the friction.</p>

<h2 id="describing-the-difference">Describing the Difference</h2>

<p>Let’s start with an example. You’re in a typical dungeon fantasy combat against
a bunch of zombies, playing an archer character. You make an attack, and
describe it like this:</p>

<p>“I draw and nock an arrow, then I take aim at the closest zombie and shoot! As
soon as the arrow flies, I’m already drawing another one from my quiver!”</p>

<p>How do other systems<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> usually handle this, and what does GURPS do that’s so
different?</p>

<h3 id="abstract-action-economies">Abstract Action Economies</h3>

<p>Most tabletop RPG systems are fairly abstract when it comes to combat. To the
rules, it doesn’t matter what motions your PC is actually going through when
they perform an action, nor does it matter how long a turn lasts. It is enough
to know what the action is, and that a turn is long enough for you to do it.</p>

<p>In systems that work this way, our archer’s narration is just a cool
embellishment that adds some fun detail to a standard ranged attack roll. All
the rules need to know is that it’s a ranged attack.</p>

<p>However, the choice of which actions perform in your turn matters a lot. You get
a certain number of them, all of which have an immediate effect in the current
turn but don’t influence future ones. Therefore the system’s incentives gently
push you to be maximally efficient on a turn-by-turn basis<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Attacks are good
because they bring the fight closer to an end. If you use your main action for
something else, it better bring as much benefit to you as attacking would, or
you have just “wasted” your turn. This set of mechanics and incentives is
usually called an “action economy”.</p>

<h3 id="the-gurps-way">The GURPS Way</h3>

<p>Where other systems are abstract, GURPS is so concrete it’s practically
brutalist. Turns last one second and its combat maneuvers are a lot more
fine-grained than combat actions in other games.</p>

<p>In the Union of Generic Universal Republics our example description is not just
a bit of flavor: it’s a five-turn plan. Ready (draw arrow), Ready (nock arrow),
Aim, Attack, Ready (draw arrow)<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Only the actual blow from your weapon, press of the trigger, or release of the
bowstring counts as an Attack. The other stuff in the plan above are maneuvers
that make your Attack possible and set it up for success. In GURPS, you want to
increase the <em>quality</em> of your attacks, not necessarily their <em>quantity</em>.</p>

<p>For the same reason GURPS is a bit less amenable to “needless embellishment”
than more abstract games. Combat goes much more smoothly when you keep your
action declarations to short sentences that map to a single maneuver. The
structure you build out of these simple blocks can end up looking every bit as
beautiful as the freeform narrative, though. This too, is brutalism.</p>

<h2 id="proposed-solutions">Proposed Solutions</h2>

<p>“The GURPS way” is neither better nor worse than the action economies of other
systems. It’s just different. But it’s different enough that it can trip up
people coming in from other games.</p>

<p>If the description above helped you smooth the friction between the rules and
your expectations, then great! But it’s likely that it didn’t, and you still
having trouble with it. In that case, here are a couple of suggestions on how to
make your experience smoother.</p>

<h3 id="solution-1-its-a-character-skill-issue">Solution 1: It’s a (Character) Skill Issue</h3>

<p>One of the big reasons to use “setup” maneuvers like Evaluate, Feint, and Aim is
that your character’s skill level might not be high enough to give you a decent
chance of success. Without those maneuvers, you’ll end up missing more often, or
will have trouble getting past your enemy’s defenses. This is common at the core
books’ default 150 points.</p>

<p>One way to make attacking every turn more feasible and fun is to raise the power
level of your characters. This is the approach taken by Dungeon Fantasy and
Action: not only do they use 250 point templates, they optimize them a fair bit.</p>

<p>All the physical combatant templates in DF start with 16 in their main combat
skill <em>at the very least</em>. Many have a 18, and a couple either start with a 20
or can get there with a bit of point shuffling.</p>

<p>This might sound excessive at first glance. Your base chance of success doesn’t
increase past 16, and it’s unlikely anyone had more than a 18 in all of human
history. Why allow PCs to <em>start</em> there, and possibly go even higher with earned
points? Because this is what you need to be able to reliably attack every second
without taking the time to perform setup maneuvers.</p>

<p>With these “overpowered” skill levels you can absorb more penalties without
having to Evaluate or Aim to offset them, and you can use Deceptive Attacks
instead of Feints without affecting your chances of success. If you still have
enough spare skill levels left, you can even thrown in a Rapid Strike to make
two attacks in that second.</p>

<h2 id="solution-2-mandatory-dramatic-pauses">Solution 2: Mandatory Dramatic Pauses</h2>

<p>Fighters in real-world combat sports and action movies don’t spend every second
of their fights furiously attacking each other. They’ll circle while looking for
openings, stop to catch their breaths, and only go in for an exchange of actual
blows every once in a while.</p>

<p>The use of setup maneuvers helps stretch fights out to be more similar to these
examples, but if you’re reading this it’s because you don’t think they’re a good
solution. And even if you do, you might want to go further.</p>

<p>One way to do this is to crib from the rules for tournament fights in GURPS
Martial Arts. Under those rules, fights are composed of <em>lulls</em> and
<em>flurries</em>. Combatants can only use the Attack maneuver<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> during a
flurry. During a lull, they cannot attack but can still use maneuvers like
Change Posture, Evaluate, Move, Ready, Aim, or even just Do Nothing while
waiting for an opening. In fantasy settings it would be a good time to cast
those healing spells.</p>

<p>GURPS Martial Arts has flurries last for 2d seconds and lulls for 4d seconds,
rolled at the start of the corresponding period. You can tweak these durations
to best suit your campaign. If the combatants’ actions look like they’re going
to force an early change, you can end the current “period” early.</p>

<p>The main purpose of introducing lulls is to extend a fight’s in-character
duration to something like that of a real-world boxing or MMA round. They can
also help change the mental “efficiency” calculation of someone who’s used to
action economies. If there’s a part of the fight where you can’t attack,
performing setup actions for when you can becomes the most efficient thing to
do.</p>

<p>Lulls work both in melee and ranged combat (when everyone might hunker down
behind cover for a while), but they might get a bit hard to manage or look a bit
silly when you have a large number of combatants in a fight.</p>
