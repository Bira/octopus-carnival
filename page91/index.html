<p>This article is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Monstrous beetles are some of the most traditional opposition for low-level
adventurers, so it’s no surprise they show up here. I was sure they’d have an
entry in the Monster Vault, but it turns out they’re MM-only. We get three
monstrous beetles in this entry, all of them Unaligned and possessed of Int 1,
the minimum possible value.</p>

<p><strong>Fire Beetles</strong> are the most traditional beetles of all. In my experience their
name often made people think they had some sort of fire attack in previous
editions, but it actually referred to the fact that they glow. Well, here they
finally get their fire attack!</p>

<p>4e Fire Beetles are Small Natural Beasts and Level 1 Brutes with 32 HP. They
bite and can use a Fire Spray (recharge 5-6) that does fire damage in a Close
Blast 3. Defensively, they have Resist 10 Fire. And yes, you can still extract
the glowing glands from a dead fire beetle and use them as torches.</p>

<p><strong>Tangler Beetles</strong> are one of the many beasts often tamed by humanoids and used
as guard animals. They’re Large Natural Beasts and Level 5 Controllers with 62
HP. They have a bite basic attack, and a ranged Entangling Spittle attack that
does no damage but immobilizes the target.</p>

<p><strong>Rot Scarab Swarms</strong> are the first swarm monster we’ve run into in this book,
and are a good showcase of the swarm rules. Individually, they’re
normal-beetle-sized and native to areas tainted by the Shadowfell (making them
shadow beasts).</p>

<p>The scarab swarm counts as a single Medium creature, a Level 8 Soldier. It has a
Swarm Attack aura 1 that allows it to make free basic attacks against anyone who
begins their turn caught in it. That basic attack is a necrotic “Swarm of Bites”
that also does ongoing necrotic damage, and they get to attack normally in their
action as well. They take half damage from melee and ranged attacks, and 10
extra damage from close (burst/blast) and area attacks.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 1, a trio of kobolds and their two pet fire
beetles.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like that Fire Beetles finally get a fire attack. I seem to remember them
having one in Neverwinter Nights, but I’m not sure if they had one in actual 3.x
D&amp;D. I’m fairly sure they didn’t have it earlier than that.</p>

<p>Rot Scarabs are a nicely creepy addition to a crypt-themed dungeon. They’re
undead-adjacent but not undead themselves, so I guess encountering them can be
somewhat surprising for PCs. Including them in a fight against undead is a good
way to make sure the cleric can’t shut the whole opposing force down with a
single turning attempt.</p>

<p>We have bears in the real world, so they don’t require much in the way of
introduction. D&amp;D has always included a variety of bears in its bestiaries,
their various real-world species lending themselves well to the “pallette swap”
approach preferred by its older editions.</p>

<p>After going through a few Monster Manual-only entries, we finally arrive at one
that exists in both books. The Monster Vault has an appendix with stats for
mundane animals, likely a response to complaints from traditionalist players
that the original Monster Manuals didn’t include any.</p>

<p>But wait! If the Monster Manual doesn’t have anything on mundane animals, what
does it say about bears? Let’s find out.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>They’re bears. Large, omnivorous, inhabit temperate or colder areas. I wasn’t
aware of it until recently, but it appears the “Bear Lore” entry in the Monster
Manual is kind of a running joke among 4e players. It’s structured just like the
lore entries for weirder monsters, so it ends up telling us a PC needs to
succeed at a DC 20 Nature check to know that bears attack with their
claws.</p>

<p>IIRC, while real-life bears can be dangerous, they usually don’t go out of their
way to attack humans, so most bear encounters will be peaceful. Of course, this
being D&amp;D, you can encounter some bears that don’t exist in real life and that
are far more ornery.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Combining the two books gives us three different bears: a mundane Bear (MV), a
Cave Bear (MM), and the ever spiky Dire Bear (both). All are Unaligned natural
beasts and have Int 2.</p>

<p>The <strong>Bear</strong> likely represents a brown bear. It’s Large, and a Level 5 Brute
with 80 HP. It attacks with its claws, and can use a Bear Grab about twice per
fight (it recharges when the bear is bloodied). This allows it to make two claw
attacks against the same target, and if either one hits the target drops prone
and the bear grabs it <em>if it has fewer than two creatures grabbed</em>. This ain’t
no normal bear hug. At the start of the bear’s turn, it deals automatic damage
against any creatures it has grabbed.</p>

<p>The <strong>Cave Bear</strong> is meant to represent a species that’s extinct in our
world. It’s a Level 6 Elite Brute with 170 HP, but for some reason it’s only
Medium. It’s more of a striker than a grappler: aside from its claws, it has a
Cave Bear Frenzy that does claw damage in a Close Burst 1 and recharges on a
5-6. That’s a bit less multi-strike ability than I’d expect from an elite
monster, but not too much less.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dire Bear</strong> follows the “bigger and spikier” theme set for dire animals in
Third Edition. The Monster Vault version is merely an update of the Monster
Manual, so I recommend using that one in all cases. It’s a Large Natural Beast
and a Level 11 Elite Brute. Its basic attack are its claws, but it will rarely
use that. The Dire Bear’s real go-to ability is Maul, which is at-will and
allows it to make two claw attacks. If both hit the same target, the bear grabs
the target if it has fewer than two creatures grabbed. This grab requires a
secondary attack in the MM version, but not in the MV one. The bear can also use
a standard action to deal lots of automatic damage to a grabbed creature (that’s
where you use its action point).</p>

<p>Suggested encounters in the MM are: Level 6, two cave bears and one bugbear
strangler (“us bears gotta stick together!”); and level 11, 1 dire bear, 1 ettin
spirit-talker, and 3 ogre minions.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions.</h2>

<p>Well, they’re bears. While there’s nothing terribly exciting about them
lore-wise, they do their job mechanically (particularly the Monster Vault
variants).</p>

<p>One thing that might be fun is to have an evil druid as a villain, using charmed
bears to do his bidding. Have the party be on the receiving end of the
Aggressively Hegemonizing Ursine Swarm for once.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/04/10/fighter-shoots-itself.html">I Learned Something About Fighter Planes</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I’ve been playing a lot of Ace Combat 5 and 7 lately, so I have fighter jets in
the brain. And today I learned something I’d never have thought was possible
from looking at the way those games or RPGs like GURPS model them.</p>

<p>Apparently, modern fighter planes are so fast they can shoot <em>themselves</em> down
by outrunning their own cannon fire! Implausible, you say? Well, if you read
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/04/dutch-f-16-takes-cannon-fire-from-itself/#p3">this bit of news</a> you’ll see that it actually happened in January of this
year with an F-16, and that there are records of at least one other incident
from back in 1956 with a Grumman F-11.</p>

<p>The gist of it is that shells are fired from the aircraft’s cannon at a speed
equal to that of the aircraft plus their muzzle velocity, as you’d
expect. However, they’re quickly slowed down by drag, so it’s possible for a
plane flying at high speeds to accelerate past the bullets it just fired and
maneuver itself into a position to be hit by them.</p>

<p>GURPS and most RPGs just tend to treat projectiles as having infinite speed. A
character shoots, and the bullet flies out to its maximum range before the end
of that character’s turn. This is a pretty decent approximation for the type of
combat that usually happens in these games, which is between people on foot and
at relatively short ranges. <strong>GURPS Tactical Shooting</strong> does have some
additional rules for projectile flight time, but those are optional and mostly
meant for snipers<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. None of the existing rule sets contemplates the speed and
ranges involved in jet age air combat.</p>

<p>Do we need specific rules for this hazard? I would say not. It’s even more of a
niche situation than long-range sniping, and the bookkeeping required to track
it would not be all that fun even in a realistic game about air combat. No, what
we have here is an <em>excellent</em> result to use if someone rolls a critical failure
on a Gunnery or Pilot test. Even if you go on to become the Ace of Aces, your
squadron-mates will forever embarass you with stories of that one time you shot
yourself down.</p>

<p>Today’s monster is the Battlebriar, a plant creature that’s entirely new to
me. It exists only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Battlebriars are weaponized biotech! These plant monsters were created to serve
as living siege engines. A direct quote from the book: “They can destroy massed
formations of lesser troops, storm defended embankments, or bring down
fortifications.”</p>

<p>Being plants, these living engines of destruction are surprisingly
low-maintenance. As long as a battlebriar has access to water, fertile soil and
sunlight, it can live forever. This makes them good guardians in addition to
being siege weapons. Fey creatures like to use them to guard their
strongholds. Other battlebriar users include Hill Giants, which I found quite
interesting. Sometimes they also escape their masters and go live in the wild.</p>

<p>Battlebriars are Unaligned and have Int 3, so PCs are most likely to fight them
when going against their masters. A wild battlebriar will likely leave the PCs
alone if they don’t provoke it, though of course they might have no alternative
if it’s blocking their goal.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We’re given two stat blocks for these things.</p>

<p>The <strong>Warthorn Battlebriar</strong> is a Large natural animate (plant), and a Level 14
Controller with 141 HP and a ground speed of 6. It has an aura of Grasping
Thorns, with a 2-square radius, that makes its area difficult terrain for
enemies and deals 5 damage to any that start their turns there. This thing has
dozens of branches constantly flailing around!</p>

<p>Aside from a reach 2 claw as a basic attack, it can also fire thorns from those
branches in a close burst 2. This targets Reflex, dealing damage an slowing
targets for a turn. Furthermore, its claw attacks pull victims towards the
monster. Getting away from this thing is quite hard: you’re slowed, in difficult
terrain, and when you manage to get away it pulls you back. It also has
threatening Reach, and so can make opportunity out to its full reach of 2
squares.</p>

<p>Its big brother is the <strong>Earthrager Battlebriar</strong>, a Huge elemental animate
(plant). It’s a Level 28 Elite Brute with 634 HP, a ground speed of 8 and a
<em>burrow</em> speed of 6. It’s made out of vines rather than thorny brambles, so its
3-square aura pulls enemies towards it. It’s the Reach 3 claws that do the
slowing. It also has threatening reach, and it can trample - that last bit is
how it attacks several characters at once.</p>

<p>It resembles the Tarrasque in its tactics when on the offensive. When used as a
guardian, it burrows and uses tremorsense to detect intruders, erupting below
them to fight.</p>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 14, a Warthorn being used as a weapon by a
party of 2 cyclopes and 3 hill giants.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Living siege engines are always cool, and these are nicely thematic for fey or
elemental Earth-themed opposition. I liked them. Like every other MM monster,
they need the damage fix, but other than that I see no fault with them. I like
that their abilities match their in-world roles. The warthorn is your infantry
killer, and the Earthrager with its burrowing and trampling ability makes short
work of castles and walls.</p>

<p>The Earthrager is the sort of weapon a mortal or fey army would round up to
fight the Tarrasque… or, since it’s elemental, it might itself be a prototype
or herald for the Big T.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Let’s Read Hell’s Rebels! On <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/01/28/hells-rebels-2-part-3-part-1.html">our last installment</a>, the PCs
explored the underground base under the ruins of the Lucky Bones casino and
cleared out a nest of diabolic cultists, but all of that only covered <em>half</em> of
the first level of the dungeon. Here we’ll go through the other half.</p>

<h2 id="lucky-bones-haunted-opium-den">Lucky Bones: Haunted Opium Den</h2>

<p>The Haunted Opium Den occupies the northern half of the level 1 map. It shares
the same basic traits: 8-foot tall walls, pervading moisture, swollen and stuck
doors. The main difference is all the doors here are closed, there’s no
illumination, the temperature is just above freezing, and the mournful moans of
lost souls echo through the hallways. In other words, it’s obviously haunted.</p>

<p>The party can access this sub-level through the door on <strong>C7</strong>, which as
mentioned <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/01/28/hells-rebels-2-part-3-part-1.html">before</a> is protected by a complex lock and an arcane ward. PCs
with the right spells and skills just might be able to get through it on their
own. Otherwise Octavio can hook them up with an NPC spellcaster to break the
seal once the cultists are cleared. “Lucky” PCs might also find a secret passage
in the hideout that leads to the bottom of a pit in this region, right into a
faceful of yellow mold.</p>

<p>Our opposition here consists entirely of undead haunting the places where they
died or guardian creatures bound by sorcery. Since no one leaves their assigned
rooms, there’s much less pressure to finish this area in one go than there is
for the hideout. Two of the encounters (Lorelu and the wretchghosts) can even be
avoided if all the party wants is to make a beeline to level 2, but all the
undead in this area must be dealt with eventually before the complex becomes
usable as a base.</p>

<p>Here’s the room key:</p>

<p><strong>C10. Private Rooms:</strong> Accessible from C7. Fancy furniture rotted by time and
moisture. Each contains a valuable hookah still in good condition.</p>

<p><strong>C11. High-Stakes Hall:</strong> Accessible from C7. Large card table with several
seats. The corpse and ghost of Guildmaster Lorelu are here. The ghost will
invite the PCs for a few “friendly” games of Odds and Evens. See below for
details on this.</p>

<p><strong>C12. Opium Den:</strong> Accessible from C7. Squat columns, claustrophobic curtained
alcoves. Three wretchghosts (see below) haunt this room and attack the living on
sight. Their corpses lie here and are loaded with fancy jewelry.</p>

<p><strong>C13. Infested Pit:</strong> Accessible from C7. An obvious, 20-foot deep pit. Rotten
rope-and-pulley device across it will crumble if anyone tries to use it to
cross. Narrow ledge on south side allows passage with an easy Acrobatics check
(DX in GURPS). Northern ledge looks similar but hinges down like the ones in C4
to drop people into the pit. The bottom of the pit contains the skeleton of a
giant snake and a whole lot of yellow mold. It also has a secret passage leading
to C4. PCs coming in from the other side of this passage for the first time will
also be exposed to the mold.</p>

<p><strong>C14. The Watcher In The Walls:</strong> Accessible from C13. Floor tiled in odd
patterns of red, green, blue and yellow tiles. A bound advanced xorn waits in
the walls and will attack anyone who tries to cross the room without stepping on
tiles of only one color (Lorelu can reveal this information). Yellow tiles
contain secret compartments (single Perception/Observation test to notice them
all) full of stolen money and jewelry. The corpses of two opium den clients
killed by the xorn contain yet more jewelry.</p>

<p><strong>C15: Master’s Office:</strong> Accessible from C14. Large conference table, filing
cabinets lining the walls, moldy portraits of all three guildmasters. A bunch of
coins and a <em>dagger of venom</em> are on the table. The files contain a lot of
obsolete ledgers, a bunch of deeds for property in Vyre that will be useful in
the next adventure, and a poem with a circled passage that will be useful in
C16.</p>

<p><strong>C16. Smuggler’s Well:</strong> Accessible from C14. Heavy battle damage on walls, old
skeletons belonging to Grey Spiders and Torrent Knights. Six ghasts lie amid the
inert skeletons. There’s a big well in the center, capped by a heavy stone slab
decorated with a xenopterid statue with gemstone eyes (looks like a man in a
trenchcoat from a distance). Pressing the eyes in the sequence circled in the
poem found on C15 causes the stone to slide and open the way to level 2. The
wrong sequence or any attempt to destroy the capstone summon a fiendish
xenopterid that attacks the party. Only one such beast can be summoned at at
time, but this keeps happening until the party gets the sequence right or
manages to fully destroy the stone. Treasure includes scattered coins, jewelry
worn by the ghasts, a <em>+1 mithral short sword</em> and a <em>vest of escape</em> amid the
bones.</p>

<h2 id="opposition-notes">Opposition Notes</h2>

<h3 id="lorelu">Lorelu</h3>

<p>If the PCs win a round against the halfling ghost, she answers a question from
them. If she wins, the gets to drain a bit of the opponent’s life. The rules for
Odds and Evens are at the start of the adventure book, initially presented as a
harmless game you can play back at the Tooth and Nail. I think I glossed over it
when describing that tavern, but it’s a nifty bit of foreshadowing when you know
what it’s for.</p>

<p>Lorelu remembers little of her life but has fairly good knowledge of the
dungeon’s layout, traps, and current events - even stuff from the second
level. Her answers are true but somewhat cryptic, and if she doesn’t know the
answer to a question “I have no idea” is valid as far as the game is
concerned. The life drain she employs on a loser causes damage to a random
ability score.</p>

<p>The list of things that will make the halfling flip out and attack the party is
quite long: disturbing her remains, displaying symbols of the Order of the
Torrent, winning more than eight games, getting caught cheating, and of course
picking a fight.</p>

<p>Lorelu is a classic D&amp;D ghost, meaning she’s insubstantial, has a monstrously
damaging spectral touch, can drain life as described above, and layers all of
that on top of the abilities she had in life as a level 6 rogue. Yes, the
spectral touch can be used for sneak attacks. Fortunately for the party, she
will not pursue them beyond the door and “resets” to a friendly attitude when
they go back in. The one way to destroy her for good is to expose her bones to
sunlight. If the PCs think to ask her about that, she will let them take her
remains to the surface and will no longer attack.</p>

<h3 id="wretchghosts">Wretchghosts</h3>

<p>Wretchghosts are a new monster described in this book. As you might expect,
they’re the ghosts of people who died from withdrawal. They’re associated with a
specific drug (opium in this case), and their touch can get people addicted to
it. They have bonuses against people addicted to the same drug as themselves,
but these people can also bypass their insubstantiality and resistances.</p>

<p>On the one hand, these former customers of the opium den were nobles and rich
merchants, so their corpses have plenty of jewelry. On the other, a few of the
PCs are likely addicted to opium after the fight ends.</p>

<p>No mention whatsoever is made of special ways to get rid of this condition, so I
guess it has to be cured the old-fashioned way. The ghosts can also use some
spell-like abilities conceptually associated with opium, and go berserk when in
the presence of the drug. You can have wretchghosts associated with other
substances too, by switching their spell-like abilities.</p>

<p>The “you’re now addicted” bit could really suck in GURPS, since Addiction there
is a significant disadvantage and getting rid of it involves spending quite a
few earned character points. Kinder GMs might wish to make it follow standard
Affliction rules and have it only last for a few minutes of cold-turkey agony,
or make it “permanent” but curable by Remove Curse.</p>

<h3 id="other-opposition">Other Opposition</h3>

<p>Ghouls have official stats on Pyramid #3/108. Increase their attributes a bit if
you want to be strict about them being <em>ghasts</em>. They’re the last of the trapped
customers to die here, having reached the battle site and resorted to
cannibalizing the corpses before they finally starved.</p>

<p>Xenopterids are Pathfinder’s version of the Moth Man legend. Man-sized bugs who
look like people in trenchcoats from a distance, with sharp claws and a natural
talent for grappling. They claw, they bite, they have venom, they drain blood,
they have tough shells.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Pathfinder doesn’t always manage to straddle the line between atmospheric and
tasteless, but I think it managed it here.</p>

<p>The Lorelu encounter is practically combat-free for a perceptive party. That’s a
lot more than I expected from the game that uses “attacks on sight and fights to
the death” unironically. As for the other monsters, I particularly liked the
wretchghosts. It’s fun to come up with new varieties of them for all the weird
fantasy drugs in your world.</p>

<p>Hitting the Haunted Opium Den early might not be a good idea even for parties
who can get through the door on their own - they’ll need to conserve their
resources for the boss fight at the Cultist Hideout.</p>
