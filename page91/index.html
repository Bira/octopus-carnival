<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Minotaurs are inspired by Greek mythology, which as usual only had the one (his
name is Asterion). They’ve been in the game pretty much since the beginning, and
are present both in the Monster Manual and the Vault here.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>We have an unusual inversion in tone here, as the Monster Manual’s description
of minotaurs is a bit more negative than the Vault’s. This is because minotaurs
became a PC option in the Player’s Handbook 3!</p>

<p>Both books agree, however, that minotaurs are a divided people. Just as humans
have a propensity for corruption, so do minotaurs have a propensity for rage of
the sort that makes you froth at the mouth. The demon lord Baphomet has taken
advantage of this, and his cult has managed to ensnare a significant percentage
of the world’s minotaur population. Its main teaching is “Unleash the Beast
Within”, so you can see why that happened.</p>

<p>Still, many other minotaurs reject these demonic teachings and instead attempt
to tame their inner beasts, turning their worship to deities such as Erathis,
Moradin and Pelor. This makes them a fierce but sophisticated people, who
strives to keep friendly relations with their neighbors whether they live in
all-minotaur settlements or whether they live in a multi-cultural civilization.</p>

<p>Both good and evil minotaurs love mazes and labyrinths of all kinds. That’s a
minotaur thing, not a Baphomet thing. Even a minotaur road built on a flat plain
will meander about rather than proceed in a straight line. They like to build
their cities in places where the geography is naturally convoluted, such as
craggy mountain chains or twisty valleys, and their architecture reinforces the
labyrinthine aspects of the terrain. It’s quite easy for outsiders to get lost
when visiting a minotaur city or delving a minotaur dungeon.</p>

<p>Minotaur philosophy is similarly maze-like. I bet they love koans. The good ones
use convoluted meditations to help keep themselves peaceful, and the evil ones
think in those terms when devising tortures for their victims.</p>

<p>Most demon-worshipping minotaurs gather in cults, and build their own
settlements with temples to Baphomet right there in the open. Some of them
forsake every part of themselves that isn’t the Beast, and go off to live as
savage hermits at the bottom of some dungeon, growing larger and bloated with
the blessings of Baphomet.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Minotaurs are usually Medium Natural Humanoids, though like dragonborn or
goliaths they’re on the larger side of Medium. Baphomet worshippers are Chaotic
Evil, but the others can be of any alignment.</p>

<p>Minotaurs from the Monster Manual have two signature traits: a <strong>Goring Charge</strong>
attack that does physical damage and knocks prone on a hit, and the <strong>Ferocity</strong>
trait that lets them make one last basic attack as a free action when they drop
to 0 HP.</p>

<p>Monster Vault minotaurs lack the Ferocity trait (which was actually moved to
orcs there). They still all have a Goring <em>something</em>, but the exact ability
varies with the stat block. It’s usually a triggered ability, though.</p>

<p>We’ll look at the entries from both books in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="minotaur-soldier-mv">Minotaur Soldier (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 8 Soldier with 89 HP, likely meant to represent the rank and
file of a minotaur fighting force. It wields a large shield and a battleaxe,
and probably wears heavy armor despite this not being shown in the stat block.</p>

<p>The <strong>Batleaxe</strong> basic attack also allows the minotaur to make a <strong>Shield Bash</strong>
on a hit. Shield bashes target Fortitude, do a tiny bit of damage, and knock
prone. They can also be done as minor actions once per round, so a minotaur who
hits all of its attacks will perform one axe strike and 2 shield bashes per
turn.</p>

<p>As an interrupt when someone adjacent to it shifts, the soldier can perform a
<strong>Goring Toss</strong> (melee 1 vs. Reflex), which does damage, immobilizes the target
for a turn and allows the minotaur to slide it 2 squares to an adjacent
square. This makes it quite sticky!</p>

<h3 id="minotaur-charger-mv">Minotaur Charger (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 9 Skirmisher has 94 HP and is more focused on offense than the
soldier.</p>

<p>As the name implies, it will try to Always Be Charging, using a <strong>falchion</strong> to
attack. Its <strong>Deft Charge</strong> trait makes it immune to opportunity attacks while
doing so! So once it reaches the group it will bounce around like a pointy
pinball of death. If for some reason the minotaur can’t charge at an enemy, it
will throw <strong>handaxes</strong> at it.</p>

<p>When damaged by an adjacent enemy, the charger can use a <strong>Goring Rush</strong> (melee
1 vs. Fortitude), which does a bit of damage and allows the charge to push the
target 4 squares and shift to follow it, 1 square at a time. So when you think
you finally have it surrounded, it will just carry the rogue away on its horns
and charge you again next turn.</p>

<h3 id="minotaur-magus-mv">Minotaur Magus (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 9 Controller (Leader) is a priest of Baphomet. It has 96 HP and
wields a glaive in combat.</p>

<p>Just by being present, the magus can compel its fellow cultists to <strong>Unleash the
Beast Within</strong>, which works as an aura 3 that gives allies inside a +2 attack
bonus on charges.</p>

<p>In addition to doing damage, the reach 2 <strong>glaive</strong> also slides targets 2
squares on a hit, 1 on a miss. This makes the magus a good second-ranker in
combat, though its real power is delivered at range.</p>

<p><strong>Crimson Bolt</strong> (ranged 20 vs. Reflex; recharge 5-6) does immediate lightning
damage plus ongoing fire damage while also preventing the target from shifting
(save ends both). A nice thing to use on those pesky mobile strikers just before
they get charged by a soldier or charger.</p>

<p>Even funnier is <strong>Baphomet’s Rage</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will), an at-will spell that
does sub-par psychic damage but also forces the target to charge a character of
the magus’ choice on a hit. You can use this on the fighter to get them to
charge the wizard and take an opportunity attack or two from your own front line
while doing so!</p>

<h3 id="minotaur-warrior-mm">Minotaur Warrior (MM)</h3>

<p>This level 10 soldier has 106 HP and is the MM’s take on the basic minotaur
infantry. Its <strong>battleaxe</strong> attacks mark for a turn, and it has the standard MM
minotaur abilities.</p>

<p>The Minotaur Soldier is generally more interesting, and you can easily level it
up to 10 if you need.</p>

<h3 id="demonic-savage-minotaur-mv">Demonic Savage Minotaur (MV)</h3>

<p>This is minotaur is Large, and a Level 11 Brute with 140 HP. It’s longer legs
give it Speed 8.</p>

<p>Having embraced its inner beast completely, this monster fights with its
claws. It can make two <strong>claw</strong> attacks per standard action, with a hit doing
physical damage and grabbing the target. It can grab up to two victims.</p>

<p>As a standard action it can also <strong>Impale</strong> a grabbed victim on its horns (melee
1 vs. Fortitude). A hit does a whole bunch of damage and ends the grab, dropping
the victim prone at the minotaur’s feet.</p>

<p>If an enemy up to 10 squares away damages the minotaur with a ranged or area
attack, it can execute a <strong>Goring Assault</strong>, charging that enemy as a free
action.</p>

<h3 id="minotaur-cabalist-mm">Minotaur Cabalist (MM)</h3>

<p>This Level 13 Controller is the Monster Manual’s take on a Baphomet-flavored
spellcaster. It has 129 HP, and is somewhat similar to the magus above.</p>

<p>The cabalist’s charge-bonus aura (<strong>Baphomet’s Boon</strong>) extends out to 10
squares, which means its allies will get the bonus every time on most maps. It
fights in melee with a <strong>great cursed mace</strong> that does a mix of physical and
necrotic damage.</p>

<p>At range, it can attack with <strong>Horns of Force</strong> (ranged 5 vs. AC), which do a
bit of force damage and push 2 squares. It can also target its bloodied allies
with <strong>Call out the Beast</strong> (Ranged 10), allowing them to make a charge as a
free action.</p>

<p>Goring Charge and Ferocity round out its abilities.</p>

<p>I think the magus wins out again, though the cabalist is functional enough as a
basic controller when you fix its damage.</p>

<h3 id="savage-minotaur-mm">Savage Minotaur (MM)</h3>

<p>This is another Large minotaur, a level 16 Brute with 190 HP. Not quite as
savage as its MV counterpart, it fights with a Reach 2 <strong>greataxe</strong> that is a
High Crit weapon and pushes the target 1 square on a hit.</p>

<p>When it charges, it can choose between the standard Goring Charge and
<strong>Thrashing Horns</strong>, which slide the target 2 squares instead of knocking it
prone.</p>

<p>A bit less terrifying than the Demonic Savage Minotaur, but effective at pushing
people around.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual obviously focuses on the evil minotaurs when building
encounters. We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 1 cabalist, 3 warriors, 2 vrock demons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: 2 savage minotaurs, 1 rakshasa noble, 3 rakshasa assassins. Here the
minotaurs are probably kept around as pets by the rakshasas.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I like it that the books themselves acknowledge there are good (or at least
unaligned) minotaurs that you can talk to instead of fighting. As a playable
option, good minotaurs are another option for people who want to be Big
Honorable Warriors struggling with a dark side.</p>

<p>Mechanically, the MV versions are usually more interesting despite being lower
level. That last part is easily adjustable, if you need them to be more
powerful.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Mind flayers are one of those monsters that are so iconic to D&amp;D they’re not
covered by the D20 license. They’ve been in the game since AD&amp;D 1st Edition, and
are present in both the Monster Manual and the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Mind flayers, or illithids, are tentacle-faced humanoids who possess incredible
psychic powers and use them to feed on sapient brains. They came from the Far
Realm long ago. Before they arrived in the world, they had a great
dimension-spanning empire whose experiments were responsible for the creation of
the Gith peoples as we know them today. That empire was torn down when their
slaves rebelled, and the illithids of today descend from its survivors.</p>

<p>Some versions of mind flayer lore assert that they come from a distant <em>future</em>,
having travelled back in time to ensure their empire rises and to prevent its
fall. A necessary step in this plan would be to turn the world into another
region of the Far Realm.</p>

<p>Your typical mind flayer is a solitary, megalomaniacal villain bent on total
world domination, who surrounds itself with large numbers of thralls to act as
its hands and eyes to enact is elaborate plans on whatever society they’re
targetting. That doesn’t mean the illithid is a coward! Should it see the need
to get into a fight personally, it will do so without hesitation. There’s no
limit to the number of thralls a single illithid may control - the process of
creating them involves brain surgery, not active psychic domination. So those
organizations may be quite large, and composed of a mix of thralls and willing
(or ignorant) collaborators.</p>

<p>Sometimes, several mind flayers with similar goals will work together, though
you probably can’t call their relationship “friendly”. In the deep Underdark you
can find large illithid cities occupying huge caverns, where many of these
beings gather and surround themselves with veritable armies of thralls. These
cities are ruled by Elder Brains, huge masses of illithid neural tissue that
live inside briny vats.</p>

<p>Mind flayers start their lives as tiny tentacled tadpoles, who upon reaching a
certain level of maturity break into some poor sapient’s skull, devour its
brain, and take over their bodies to mutate them into their adult form. In
illithid cities, these tadpoles live in the Elder Brain brine pool until someone
gives them a body.</p>

<p>Some versions of mind flayer lore mention that illithids who die in these cities
have their minds assimilated by the Elder Brain. They consider this to be the
perfect afterlife, believing their conscience lives on inside the Brain as part
of a collective. The truth is that while the process does make the Elder Brain
more powerful, it erases the conscience of the individuals joined to it.</p>

<p>5e tied all illithids a lot more closely to the Elder Brains, making them
practically into a hive mind, but this isn’t true here. Individual, independent
illithids are exactly that. They don’t need exceptional reasons to reject life
in an Underdark city - maybe their plans for world domination are just
incompatible (“I’m going to be the boss, not you”). This means that it’s
perfectly possible to fight mind flayers in the surface without this being
necessarily tied to some Underdark conspiracy.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual gives us 2 mind flayer stat blocks, and the Vault gives
us 3. All are Medium Aberrant Humanoids with Darkvision and a land speed
of 7. Every mind flayer can use a mind blast, grapple with its face tentacles,
and do creepy things to people’s brains, though the exact effects vary.</p>

<p>All Mind Flayers understand Deep Speech, and can communicate via telepathy
regardless of language barriers.</p>

<h3 id="mind-flayer-infiltrator-mm">Mind Flayer Infiltrator (MM)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 14 Lurker with 107 HP and trained Perception, as well as a host
of other thiefy skills.</p>

<p>It it has to fight, the infiltrator will probably open up with its <strong>Mind
Blast</strong> (Close Blast 5 vs. Will; recharge 6), which does psychic damage and
dazes on a hit (save ends). Mind flayers and thralls are immune to this power,
and the infiltrator itself is invisible to any dazed or stunned enemies (<strong>Stalk
the Senseless</strong>).</p>

<p>It will then attack the squishiest target with its <strong>tentacles</strong>, which grab the
target on a hit. After grabbing a victim, it will proceed with <strong>Bore Into
Brain</strong> (Melee 1 vs. Fortitude), something which it can also use against stunned
targets without grabbing them first. This does more damage than the basic
attack, and if it happens to reduce the target’s HP to 0, the illithid eats its
brain and kills it instantly. No death saves for you!</p>

<p>As lurkers, they probably give preference to targets made vulnerable by the Mind
blast, and rely on their buddies and thralls to handle anyone who wasn’t
affected. MM grab rules use either the Fort or Reflex as escape DCs, so you’re
looking at a DC of 25 or 27 to get away from the infiltrator before it begins
eating your brain.</p>

<h3 id="mind-flayer-thrall-master-mv">Mind Flayer Thrall Master (MV)</h3>

<p>This one is a Level 14 Elite Controller (Leader) with 260 HP. Its trained skills
are Arcana and Insight, so it’s more of a scholar than a hands-on type.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean its defenseless! The thrall master fights in a way that’s
somewhat similar to the MM’s Infiltrator, but with stronger psychic powers. Its
<strong>Mind Blast</strong> (Close Blast 5 vs. Will; Recharge 5-6) works similarly but on a
critical hit it dominates instead of dazing (save ends).</p>

<p>The <strong>tentacles</strong> still grab on a hit, but they also hit dazed or stunned
targets automatically. The escape DC is 21, and while the thrall master can only
grab one person at a time, it can explicitly keep whipping other fools with its
tentacles after that.</p>

<p>Against the grabbed victim, the mind flayer can use <strong>Manipulate Brain</strong>
(vs. Fortitude), which does a big chunk of physical damage and stuns the target
until it’s no longer grabbed! If this reduces the victim to 0 HP, the thrall
master has two choices: it can either devour the brain, killing the victim and
regaining 20 HP, or it can perform a field-expedient thrall surgery. This
restores the victim to 1 HP and dominates it until the thrall master is slain.</p>

<p>Since the dominated condition also leaves the victim dazed, this results in a
1-HP, zombie-like thrall, whose main defence is the fact that its companions
might not want to make it roll death saves. I imagine the illithid can do
further work out of combat to make these thralls act more normally.</p>

<h3 id="mind-flayer-mastermind-mm">Mind Flayer Mastermind (MM)</h3>

<p>This is essentially a more powerful variant of the Monster Vault’s Thrall
Master. It’s a Level 18 Elite Controller with 324 HP and training in Perception,
Arcana, Insight, Bluff and Intimidate.</p>

<p>It can use its <strong>tentacles</strong>, <strong>Mind Blast</strong> and <strong>Bore Into Brain</strong> abilities
in much the same way the thrall master can. Aside from the damage bug, the main
difference here is that thrall surgery restores the victim to half its maximum
HP, not just 1.</p>

<p>The mastermind can directly <strong>Enslave</strong> a creature (Ranged 10 vs. Will), an
attack which does no damage but dominates (save ends). Dominated creatures
become immune to the flayer’s mind blast and gain a +5 bonus to Will while
within 10 squares of it. The victims it makes into thralls also gain this
benefit, by the way. Only one creature can be enslaved at a time, but as usual
it can have as many thralls as it can make.</p>

<p>The mastermind can also plant an <strong>Illusion of Pain</strong> in its victims (Area Burst
1 within 10 vs. Will; Enemies only; recharge 5-6) which does both immediate and
ongoing psychic damage and immobilizes (save ends).</p>

<p>When attacked, it can use <strong>Craddle of the Elder Brain</strong> (recharge 5-6) as an
interrupt, teleporting up to 20 squares. If it’s targeted by a melee attack, it
can instead <strong>Interpose Thrall</strong>, an interrupt which redirects the attack to a
nearby thrall. That’s definitely going to be its preferred option if it has
thralls nearby, with the teleport working as a tool of escape.</p>

<h3 id="mind-flayer-unseen-mv">Mind Flayer Unseen (MV)</h3>

<p>A more powerful version of the Infiltrator, this one is a Level 18 Lurker with
126 HP. It’s almost identical aside from the fixed damage, which makes its
<strong>Extract Brain</strong> attack truly frightening.</p>

<p>Instead of being invisible to dazed characters, the Unseen has a <strong>Mental
Cloak</strong> power which, as a move action, allows it to teleport its speed and
become invisible for a turn. It recharges whenever the Unseen is hit by an
attack.</p>

<h3 id="concordant-mind-flayer-mv">Concordant Mind Flayer (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 19 Controller (Leader) also works more or less like the Thrall
Master. It has 174 HP.</p>

<p>Its attacks are the usual trifecta of <strong>Mind Blast</strong>, <strong>tentacles</strong> and brain
manipulation, which in this case is named <strong>Enthrall Brain</strong> and only gives the
option of turning victims reduced to 0 HP into thralls. Like the Thrall Master,
its mind blast dominates on a critial hit.</p>

<p>The Concordant Mind Flayer’s exclusive trick is <strong>Shared Pain</strong>, a reaction that
triggers when an ally within 5 squares takes damage from an attack. The illithid
can make one of its dominated victims in a Close Burst 5 take 20 psychic damage
which bypasses all of its resistances. This is sure to kill someone that’s been
made into a thrall during the fight, since they’ll only have 1 HP. It doesn’t
prevent damage to the ally - it’s more of a hostage situation. “Attack my
friends and your friends will suffer!”</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Mind flayers typically consider themselves superior to everyone else. Anyone
found working with them is probably a thrall or underling. I’d consider thralls
created outside of combat to be able to act normally instead of being considered
dazed.</p>

<p>It’s possible for there to be a more congenial illithid that lives openly as a
scholar and gentlesquid in a community ruled by another species. The most likely
scenario in this case is that it lives and works alongside drow or duergar -
congenial doesn’t mean <em>good</em>.</p>

<p>This gives us the two sample encounters from the MM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: 1 mind flayer infiltrator, 1 drider fanglord, 1 drow blademaster, 2
drow warriors. Here’s our gentlesquid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: 1 mind flayer mastermind, 1 mind flayer infiltrator, 3 grimlock
followers, 2 war trolls. And here’s a pair of more traditional illithids and
their thralls.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Mind flayers are such an iconic monster that even WoTC thinks it’s not D&amp;D if
they’re not in the books. And they do make excellent villains! You could have a
single individual be the ultimate villain in even a mid-Heroic tier adventure by
statting it up as a level 8 solo or the like.</p>

<p>Unlike what happens with the more naturalistic humanoids, this is one of the
rare instances where I’m fine with the books portraying them as almost
universally Evil. Good mind-flayers should be once-in-a-campaign events at most.</p>

            <p>We already lightly touched upon medusas on the entry for gorgons (which, in D&amp;D,
are entirely unrelated). They’re based on Greek Myth, where Medusa was an
individual, the only mortal among the semi-divine Gorgon sisters. I see them on
the Rules Cyclopedia, so they’ve been around since at least BECMI and probably
since the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As is common with creatures based on singular entities from Greek Myth, D&amp;D
medusas are an entire species of humanoids with snake-like features. Females
have the iconic hair snakes, and their gaze can petrify victims. Males are
completely bald, and their gazes can “poison the mind and body”.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual portrays medusas as a haugthy and ambitious people. They live
in small groups, but their ambition drives them to seek money and power in the
societies of others. Evil medusas turn up as assassin guild masters or
terrifying nobles, but you also get nicer ones working as eccentric veiled
scholars and alchemists. Eberron has medusas make up part of the elite in the
monster nation of Droaam, so you can have medusa ambassadors and such.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault, as usual goes a bit harder on the evil angle and says that
medusas are universally regarded as unnatural by all the other sapients. Rumors
and myths abound about their origins, and run along two main lines. One says
they were wholesome/wicked people who got punished/rewarded by Zehir with their
current forms. The other says they were the result of yuan-ti genetic
experiments, originally meant to serve as a slave race. Villainous medusas do
often worship Zehir, the snake god of treachery and snakes, and they often have
cordial relations with yuan-ti, who are one of the few other peoples they are
said to truly respect.</p>

<p>Medusas like to decorate the area around their lairs as demarcation and
warning. There’s the classic statue gardens, of course, and males also like to
paint the walls with the blood of their victims.</p>

<figure class="right">

<p>The Monster Vault also turns them into another of those evil matriarchies where
males are oppressed, with only those few who are immune to petrification being
singled out for special treatment. The Monster Manual makes no mention of this,
and says every medusa is immune to petrification regardless of gender.</p>

<p>In combat, medusas use weapons, with a preference for swords and bows. Their
blades and arrows are often coated in poison derived from the their own saliva
or blood. Someone who has been petrified by a medusa can be brought back to life
by the application of a few drops of that medusa’s blood to the victim’s
lips. While the text assumes you’ll kill the medusa to get that blood, I don’t
think that’s a hard requirement. If you do kill it, you must apply the blood to
the victims within 24 hours.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Medusas are Medium Natural Humanoids. All are immune to petrification, and have
some degree of poison resistance. They also have a gaze attack, which can be
either petrification or venom depending on the individual.</p>

<p>Gaze mechanics are different in both books. MM gazes are standard action
attacks, to which blind creatures are immune. It’s up to the PCs to decide
whether it’s safer to fight an elite paragon medusa blindfolded or to risk its
gaze.</p>

<p>MV gazes are triggered actions, which means the monster doesn’t need to choose
between using its weapons or its gaze in a turn. Also, blinding yourself won’t
save you from these gazes.</p>

<h3 id="medusa-archer-mm">Medusa Archer (MM)</h3>

<p>This lady is has the closest stat block to the classic medusas of editions
past. She’s a Level 10 Elite Controller with 212 HP. Her speed is 7 and her
poison resistance 10.</p>

<p>She fights in melee with her <strong>Snaky Hair</strong>, which does a bit of physical damage
plus 10 ongoing poison damage, and also inflicts a -2 penalty to Fortitude (save
ends both). Her main ranged attack is a <strong>Longbow</strong> (range 20/40 vs AC) whose
poison-dipped arrows trigger a secondary attack against Fortitude on a hit,
causing the same rider effects as the hair.</p>

<p>The archer’s <strong>Petrifying Gaze</strong> is a Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude. It slows on a
hit, and this worsens to immobilized on the first failed save and to full
petrification on the second. The first two conditions are (save ends), but
petrification is permanent until cured. This is an <em>at-will</em> power, and the
perfect thing to use on people already weakened by the poison from the other
attacks.</p>

<h3 id="medusa-bodyguard-mv">Medusa Bodyguard (MV)</h3>

<p>One of those poor oppressed MV males, this guy is a Level 12 Soldier with 123
HP. He is <em>not</em> immune to petrification and has Resist 10 Poison and Speed 6.</p>

<p>The bodyguard is armed with a <strong>broadsword</strong> and a <strong>longbow</strong>. The longsword
marks for a turn on a hit, and both attacks have an ongoing 5 poison damage
(save ends) rider. The bodyguard’s <strong>Mind-Venom Gaze</strong> triggers as an interrupt
when a marked target ignores the mark. It’s a Close Blast 5 vs. Will that must
include the triggering character. It does a good bit of poison damage to those
it hits, and also stuns the triggering character if it hits them. The gaze
recharges whenever the bodyguard hits with his sword, and blind creatures are
<em>not</em> immune.</p>

<h3 id="medusa-venom-arrow-mv">Medusa Venom Arrow (MV)</h3>

<p>Venom arrows are non-elite versions of the MM Archers, being level 12 artillery
monsters with 96 HP.</p>

<p>Like Archers, they fight in melee with their less-whimsically named <strong>serpent
hair</strong>, which deals poison damage and inflicts a -2 to Fortitude for a
turn. Their Range 30 <strong>bows</strong> do physical damage, ongoing 5 poison damage, and slow
(save ends).</p>

<p>Their <strong>Petrifying Stare</strong> is a triggered opportunity action. If an enemy starts
they turn within 2 squares of the medusa, they’re subject to a gaze that hits
<em>automatically</em> and slows them (save ends). This progresses to full
permanent petrification just like the Archer’s gaze.</p>

<p>The possible cures for this petrification are specified here: the right power or
ritual, a willing kiss from the medusa, or the afore-mentioned blood drops.</p>

<h3 id="medusa-warrior-mm">Medusa Warrior (MM)</h3>

<p>We’re back in elite territory with these dudes, who are Level 13 Elite Soldiers
with 272 HP. They fight with <strong>longswords</strong> and <strong>longbows</strong> as well.</p>

<p>The longsword attacks trigger a secondary attack against Fortitude on a hit,
dealing ongoing 10 poison damage and slowing (save ends both). The arrows
automatically inflict the ongoing damage if they hit (save ends).</p>

<p>As elites, warriors can use a standard action to make two sword attacks, and
those deal extra damage against a dazed target. Their source of daze effects is
their <strong>Venomous Gaze</strong> (Close Blast 5 vs. Will), which does poison and psychic
damage, with “daze” and “weaken” riders (save ends both).</p>

<p>Warriors prefer melee, alternating between their gaze and their double sword
attacks. If you have more than one, they’ll coordinate their actions to that
effect as well.</p>

<h3 id="medusa-spirit-charmer-mv">Medusa Spirit Charmer (MV)</h3>

<p>The lady medusa from the MV. She’s a Level 13 Controller with 130 HP, immunity
to petrification and resist poison 10. This is more of a spellcaster or psion
type.</p>

<p>Like the MM archer, she uses her <strong>serpent hair</strong> to fight in melee, doing
poison damage on a hit and inflicting a -2 penalty to saves for a turn. Her main
ranged attack is <strong>Spirit Charm</strong> (Close Blast 5 vs. Will), which does a bit of
psychic damage and compels the target to approach the medusa. This isn’t a pull,
but a choice: the victim must either end their next turn within 2 squares of the
medusa, or it must take further psychic damage.</p>

<p>Once per encounter she can cast <strong>Swords to Snakes</strong> (Area Burst 1 Within 10
vs. Will), an illusion that makes people think their weapons and tools have
become snakes. This prevents them from using weapon or implement powers (save
ends).</p>

<p>The spirit charmer’s Signature Medusa Move is the <strong>Stony Glare</strong>, a reaction
that triggers if an enemy ends their movement within 2 squares of the
medusa. Which by the way can happen due to Spirit Charm! This is a Close Blast 2
that only affects the triggering enemy, targets Fortitude, and petrifies
<em>immediately</em>. This is a (save ends) condition until the third failed save, in
which it becomes permanent until cured.</p>

<p>The possible cures are the same as those of the Venom Arrow’s gaze.</p>

<h3 id="medusa-shroud-of-zehir-mm">Medusa Shroud of Zehir (MM)</h3>

<p>A powerful Zehir-worshipping avenger or assassin. This lady is a Level 18
Skirmisher with 172 HP. She is immune to petrification and has 10 resistance to
both acid and poison.</p>

<p>The Shroud fights with paired <strong>short swords</strong>, which do physical damage and
ongoing acid and poison damage (save ends). She will often use a maneuver named
<strong>Fangs of Death</strong> (recharge 4-6) which allows her to make two sword attacks and
shift 3 squares between them. There’s a typo in her attack bonus, which is
listed as +15 instead of the correct +23.</p>

<p>Her <strong>Snaky Hair</strong> is a minor action, with the right attack bonus and the same
damage as a sword blow. It inflicts the same ongoing damage and a further -2
penalty to Fortitude (save ends both).</p>

<p>The <strong>Petrifying Gaze</strong> is here and works the same as the archer’s.</p>

<p>Shrouds spam those snake bites and use Fangs of Death whenever it’s
charged, since it spreads the poison around and allows them more mobility. When
it’s not charged, they use their gazes.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There are a few on the MM.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11: 1 medusa archer, 1 venom-eye basilisk, and a gaggle of snaketongue
cultists.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: 1 medusa warrior, a bunch of grimlocks and 2 gargoyles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 2 shrouds of Zehir, 1 yuan-ti malison disciple of Zehir, and 3
yuan-ti abominations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, medusas are probably the world’s premier basilisk owners, since
they are completely immune to that monster’s gazes and they complement their own
powers nicely. I imagine even good medusas subscribe to newsletters on the care
and feeding of basilisks.</p>

<p>They also tend to associate with or employ other monsters who are similarly
immune to their powers, like the blind grimlocks or gargoyles and other
earth-elemental creatures. Also, if you feel like yuan-ti alone don’t give you
enough options to stock a dungeon full of snake-people, you can add some medusas
in. If you believe those MV myths, medusas are instinctively compelled to serve
yuan-ti, probably the only instance where they would put themselves in the
“servant” position.</p>

<p>Personally I like the image of the “archer medusa” a lot, and as with most other
humanoids I’d probably include non-villainous medusa in my setting to go along
with the usual antagonists. The stat blocks from both books seem to imply their
gazes attacks are always entirely voluntary, which would mean a peaceful medusa
wouldn’t even need those veils or dark goggles. Guess they might still wear them
as a sign of goodwill, though, like sometimes knights will peace-bond their
swords to show they mean no harm.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>My first contact with Maruts was in Third Edition, where they were a type of
Inevitable, a Lawful Neutral outsider. It could be that they predate that
edition (though AD&amp;D was all about modrons instead). Here, they appear only on
the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In Fourth Edition, Maruts are enigmatic natives of the Astral Sea, usually found
wandering that plane and others as mercenaries for hire. As mercenaries, they
probably don’t care much about who their bosses are, as long as those bosses
stick to their end of the contract. If they don’t, I imagine retribution
is… inevitable.</p>

<p>The price for a Marut’s service is always a reciprocal service, to be specified
at a later date. They keep an exacting record of these favors in their astral
fortresses. No one knows why they’re gathering favors in this manner.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two Marut stat blocks here, both epic. They have some common traits:
trained Perception, Truesight, a land speed of 8, plus flight and teleport
speeds of 4. They’re also immune to sleep, have Resist 10 Thunder, and an
amazing Regeneration of 20 with no weaknesses that temporarily shut it
down. These things are really hard to kill and really hard to get away from.</p>

<p>Maruts are Unaligned, being indifferent to the cosmic struggle between good and
evil. All they care about is keeping their ledgers balanced.</p>

<h3 id="marut-blademaster">Marut Blademaster</h3>

<p>This Medium Immortal Humanoid is a Level 21 Soldier with 201 HP and all common
marut traits. It wields a greatsword in combat.</p>

<p>That <strong>greatsword</strong> is its only attack, doing a mix of physical and thunder
damage. A hit also pushes the target 1 square and marks them for a turn.</p>

<p>The damage of that basic attack is a bit underwhelming due to the early math,
but the blademaster will often (recharge 4-6) be able to make two such attacks a
round, making it considerably more dangerous.</p>

<p>You probably want to use enough of these to form a battle line. It’s hard to
stand your ground against a wall of marut blademasters, and it gets even harder
when they have backup.</p>

<h3 id="marut-concordant">Marut Concordant</h3>

<p>This Large Immortal Humanoid is a Level 22 Elite Controller with 418 HP and all
common marut traits. Concordants fight with their fists and with decrees backed
by mystical power.</p>

<p>You’ll likely see them coming at you from behind a battle line of
blademasters. They’ll bombard your position with <strong>Fortune’s Chains</strong> (Area
Burst 5 Within 20 vs. Will; enemies only; recharge 4-6), likely catching the
whole party and doing psychic damage with a daze rider (save ends).</p>

<p>Then they’ll stop melee PCs on their tracks with <strong>Dictums</strong> (minor action;
Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude), which do no damage but immobilize (save ends). When
the party finally manages to crash into the battle line, the concordants will
push them away again with a <strong>Thunderous Edict</strong> (Close Burst 5 vs. Fortitude;
enemies only; recharge 5-6) which does thunder damage and pushes 4 squares on a
hit.</p>

<p>If all of these powers happen to be recharging at the moment, they’ll content
themselves with reaching over the heads of the blademaster vanguard and punching
the PCs with Reach 2 <strong>slams</strong> that do a mix of physical and thunder damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s one level 23 sample encounter: 1 concordant, 2 blademasters, a war
devil, and 8 legion devils. There’s your battle line.</p>

<p>Fans of 3e inevitables are probably missing a lot of the lore that was removed
along with the Great Wheel cosmology. Personally, while I think 3e inevitables
were interesting, I also like the new lore. Enigmatic mercenaries stockpiling
favors for some future cosmic plan is an interesting background that leaves room
for GM creativity.</p>

            <p><a href="https://lichvanwinkle.blogspot.com">Lich van Winkle’s Return to Gaming</a> is a rather interesting blog I found
through <a href="http://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-blog-addition-lich-van-winkle.html">Dungeon Fantastic</a>. Its author started role-playing with D&amp;D basic
back in 1981, stopped around the mid-90’s, and is now coming back to the hobby
after a 25-year hiatus.</p>

<p>I found some of the post titles there interesting enough, and the blog itself is
new enough, that I’m reading it from the beginning. The <a href="https://lichvanwinkle.blogspot.com/2020/02/back-to-table-top-roleplaying-games.html">first post</a> proves
that it’s going to be an interesting ride, because this is someone who played
back when the old school was new and who says that “there is a lot of
myth-making in the OSR”. Me, I started playing shortly before Mr. van Winkle
here stopped, but I think I’ll find plenty to agree with.</p>
