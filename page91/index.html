  <figcaption>
    Dire boar (left) and Thunderfury Boar (right).
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Boars are real animals, so you probably know what they look like
already. Boar-hunting was a very prestigious and difficult endeavor in medieval
times, since real-world wild boars are deadly opposition for someone armed with
a spear.</p>

<p>Still, the Monster Manual seems to think your typical PC party would have little
trouble handling real-world boars, much like Asterix and Obelix. So it provides
us with more extreme versions.</p>

<p>These exist only on the Monster Manual - while the Monster Vault has an appendix
on animals, it doesn’t contain boars.</p>

<h2 id="dire-boar">Dire Boar</h2>

<p>Like a real-world boar, but bigger, meaner, and spikier. It’s a Large Natural
Beast (mount). Creatures with the “mount” keyword confer special abilities to
their riders. Not all beasts that can serve as mounts have the keyword - only
those who grant these abilities to their riders. Early rules for mounted combat
stated that PCs had to have the Mounted Combat feat to benefit from these mount
powers, and mount stat blocks usually stated that the rider also had to have a
minimum level. All of this had been done away with by the time the MV came out.</p>

<p>Indeed, dire boars can be domesticated as mounts, though even then they’re
ill-tempered and tough to handle. They’re also the preferred mount for dwarven
cavalry units. So yeah, dwarves have dire boar cavalry! It makes perfect sense
when you think about it: the riders have a temper to match that of their mounts,
and the mounts menace with spikes of bone.</p>

<p>Rules-wise, dire boars are Level 6 Brutes, have 85 HP, and move with
Speed 8. They attack by goring with their tusks, which does extra damage against
a prone target. When the boar is reduced to 0 HP, it gores one last time as a
free action.</p>

<p>They’re also good at charging! A gore attack done as part of a charge does extra
damage, pushes the target 2 squares and knocks them prone. So their preferred
tactic is to charge someone and them gore them repeatedly while they’re down.</p>

<p>If used as a mount, the boar gets to make a gore attack in
addition to the rider’s attack when the duo charges. The way I understand it,
this gore attack also gets the charge benefit I described above.</p>

<h2 id="thunderfury-boar">Thunderfury Boar</h2>

<p>The platonic ideal of a badass boar, native to the Feywild. It’s even bigger,
even meaner, and even spikier than a dire boar. This boar is a Large fey beast,
no mount keyword. You can’t truly domesticate these beasts, but clever fey
sometimes keep them captive and release them in the general direction of people
they want dead. They have Int 5 but no languages. Whether this means they’re
super-cunning animals or actually sapient is left as an exercise for the GM.</p>

<p>The thunderfury boar is a Level 15 Brute with 182 HP and ground speed 8. It
fights in much the same way as its cousing above, with goring charges followed
by more goring, but it has a few differences aside from the increased
damage. Its basic gore attack deals increased damage when the boar is bloodied,
and its charges deal an extra 10 thunder damage on top of that. It also has an
attack named Thunderfury, rechaging on 5-6, which from what I understand it is a
big stomp that sends a shockwave around the boar. It’s a close burst 2 that
targets Fort, does thunder damage and knocks prone. On a miss, it still deals
half damage.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 5, a dire boar and a party of 5 orc regulars (1
shaman, 4 berserkers). Having one of the berserkers ride the boar will give you
the most bang for the buck when it comes to charging attacks.</p>

<p>The most awesome thing for me here was the bit about dwarven boar cavalry. I’m
really tempted to stat up a unit of level 6 dwarven knights riding dire
boars. Beware the charge of the 15th Thundertusks!</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels.html">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<p>Time to finally end Turn of the Torrent! When we last left off, we had just
finished exploring level 1 of the complex under the Lucky Bones casino. Now it’s
time to descend to level 2.</p>

<h2 id="lucky-bones-lower-basement">Lucky Bones: Lower Basement</h2>

<p>This is a literal dungeon! It’s here that the Spiders kept their captives while
waiting to ransom them or sell them into slavery.</p>

<p>The most important thing about the Lower Basement is that it’s almost completely
flooded, and will remain so until the PCs clear it. The <em>ring of swimming</em> from
Adventure 1 and <em>cloak of the manta ray</em> from level 1 of this same dungeon will
surely be useful, though in the end the whole party needs a way to breathe
underwater if they want to venture here.</p>

<p>Potions and scrolls of <em>water breathing</em> are available in the open market in
Kintargo, and if Octavio is in friendly terms with the PCs he might ask the
seers back at the Shrine of Saint Senex for their <em>wands of wather
breathing</em>. Once that’s taken care of, the party still needs to mind the many
combat penalties they’ll get against this level’s aquatic denizens.</p>

<p>Things get a bit more expensive in Dungeon Fantasy, since its water breathing
spell has a duration in the scale of minutes instead of hours. A wizard who
happens to have learned it at skill 20 could keep it on indefinitely on
themselves. They’d need skill 25 to cover the whole party.</p>

<p>Item-wise, there’s an alchemical amulet of water breathing in <strong>DFRPG Magic
Items</strong> that costs $23.400 and works for as long as it’s worn. If your party
isn’t rich enough to buy one for each PC, you could introduce a more
reasonably-priced alternative that only lasts for about as long as the
Pathfinder potion.</p>

<p>Opposition in this level is a band of skum spies sent here by an aboleth
necromancer to spy on Kintargo. The aboleth doesn’t have any designs on the
city, it’s just sending spies on general principle. The skum “foot soldiers” are
led by the wizard Ungol-Pagh, and either brought of befriended a bunch of other
sea monsters to act as guards down here. They’ve also captured a group of sea
elf rangers who came in here to search for their missing ally, the opera singer
Shensen (who vanished in the initial Thrune purges before Adventure 1 started).</p>

<p>Here’s our condensed room key:</p>

<p><strong>D1. Flooded Warehouse</strong>: Completely submerged in cold and still but mostly
clear water. Large square stone pillars, a pile of algae-caked rubble. Five skum
lounge here and will likely see the PCs as soon as they come in. They attack on
sight and fight to the death<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Secret passage in a hollow pillar leads to D2
and requires a very hard Perception check to find. Obvious exit to D8 and up the
well back to C16. If the party leaves, any surviving skum relocate to D8.</p>

<p><strong>D2. Hidden Passageway</strong>: Accessible from secret door in D1. Corridor with
stairs that rise out of the water and lead to D3.</p>

<p><strong>D3. Vault Door:</strong> Accessible from D2. This area is above the water
level. Large iron door with a fiendish (pun intended) combination lock that
requires three hard lockpicking tests to open. Failure triggers a large blade
trap embedded in the door that attacks the intruder for a boatload of cutting
damage. The skeletal corpse of Guildmaster Baccus lies at the foot of the door
(he fumbled the combination).</p>

<p>Baccus wears several magic items, which we’ll look at in detail later. He also
clutches three keys to the chests inside the vault, and carries a fragment of a
devil-summoning book<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> containing a word that can cause great pain to the
drowning devil on this level of the dungeon.</p>

<p><strong>D4. Gray Vault:</strong> Accessible from D3. Three heavy iron chests; skeleton of a
human woman with eight spidery legs protuding from her back. The locks on the
chests are even harder to open than the ones on the vault door, but Baccus’
corpse has the keys.</p>

<p>The skeleton belongs to the vault’s former guardian, a jorogumo from Tian
Xia<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. It’s inert and harmless, but serves as foreshadowing for the next
adventure. The chests contain quite a bit of money and loot, as well as a couple
of cursed surprises. We’ll look at them in detail below, but bear in mind that
some of the cursed items may alert the surviving Gray Spider leader that her old
lair has been breached.</p>

<p><strong>D5. Shells and Pillories.</strong> Accessible from D1. Low ceiling, completely
flooded. Whiping posts, rusty empty cages, well leading to D11, doorway leading
to D6, secret door leading to D7. Two piles of shells in this room are actually
a pair of Shell Sentinels, amorphous seashell golems who animate and attack any
intruders (meaning any non-skum).</p>

<p><strong>D6. Acisazi Prisoners.</strong> Accessible from D5. Completely flooded. Several
cells, currently containing a five person squad of sea elf rangers from the
Acisazi tribe. If freed and given equipment, they will gladly help the PCs clear
this level. They’re weaker than the PCs, but work well underwater and are
valuable as support. The party gains XP for each elf who survives to the end of
the adventure.</p>

<p>The elves came here looking for Shensen’s help against an aboleth wizard
threatening their village - the same wizard who sent the skum here. Helping the
village is an excellent way to gain outside support for the Silver Ravens, and
is covered in the next adventure.</p>

<p>The PCs have about two weeks from the moment they enter the level to rescue the
elves. It’s unlikely they’ll take that long, but at the end of this time the
prisoners are taken away to be turned into more slaves for the aboleth.</p>

<p><strong>D7. Pump Room.</strong> Accessible through secret door in D5. The skum know about
this door. Completely flooded. Contains a huge, broken magical pump. Repairing
the pump will take three days, some money and the services of a skilled
enchanter (like Hetamon Haace). It also requires recovering a missing part from
room D10.</p>

<p>Once repaired, the pump will drain areas D1-D9 and D12. Fixing it gives the
party a large XP award and is one of the main goals in the adventure, after
clearing this level.</p>

<p><strong>D8. Smuggler’s Cave.</strong> Accessible from D1. Completely flooded. A cave with a
submerged dock. Four skum lounge here with two trained reefclaws. Any survivors
from D1 will retreat here as well. An alarm spell will go off as soon as the PCs
enter from D1, alerting the skum leader in D12.</p>

<p>Reefclaws look like lobsters with eel backsides. They attack with grabby
poisonous claws and constriction.</p>

<p>Also here are two watertight barrels containing still-functional <em>bottles of
air</em>.</p>

<p><strong>D9. Sewer Access.</strong> Accessible from D8. Small submerged cave, tunnel leads
off the map and into a Kintargo sewer. Guarded by a devilfish in league with the
skum. A devilfish is a sapient (but stupid) seven-armed octopus the size of a
horse that attacks with tentacles, a bite, and a cloud of poisonous
blood.</p>

<p><strong>D10. Pump Valves.</strong> Accessible from D8. Completely submerged. Several pipes
with magical valves connect to the pump in D7. One of the pipes is missing a
valve, pried out by the skum and currently in possession of their leader in D12.</p>

<p><strong>D11. Disposal Cave.</strong> Accessible from D10 or from well in D5. Completely
submerged cave, walls encrusted with filth and sludge, huge pile of refuse in
the center beneath the well. The refuse pile is the nest of an advanced globster
whom the skum have been feeding. It investigates any noises and attacks if not
immediately fed, fighting to the death.</p>

<p>A globster is a huge, blubbery underwater ooze. This one is particularly huge
and blubbery.</p>

<p><strong>D12. Observation Post.</strong> Accessible from D8 or from secret passage in
D13. Underwater cave, walls partly covered with glowing lichen. The leader of
the skum, a skum wizard named Ungol-Pagh, carves notes about his spying on the
walls for future reference and attacks the PCs as soon as he becomes aware of
them.</p>

<p>Ungol-Pagh is a level 7 wizard, meaning he’s slightly stronger than a PC wizard
would be at this point. He has lots of charm and paralysis spells, plus a wand
of <em>lightning bolt</em> with 12 charges, which is surely the thing you want to have
when fighting underwater.</p>

<p><strong>D13. River Access.</strong> Accessible from D8. Underwater cave links to a river
outside Kintargo, and is guarded by a drowning devil originally summoned by
Guildmaster Baccus. The devil summoning text found on Baccus’ corpse in D3
contains a word that causes this devil great pain. The devil is currently
aligned with the skum, whose leader promised to find a way to free it from its
binding.</p>

<p>Drowning devils have this name because they like to drown others. They’re Large,
look like four-armed eels, are fully amphibious, and have all sorts of
waterbending powers that maked them oodles of Fun (TM) to fight underwater.</p>

<h3 id="the-loot">The Loot</h3>

<p>The magic items on Baccus are a <em>+2 mithral chain shirt</em>, a <em>handy haversack</em>
full of money, a <em>+1 lawful outsider bane mithral dagger</em>, and a <em>ring of
protection +2</em>. I guess this is officially the point where the PCs are supposed
to upgrade to +2-tier gear. And that dagger is a handy weapon against devils!</p>

<p>The first chest in the vault contains a whole lot of money. The second a whole
bunch of potions and poisons, including a vial of oil of life distilled from the
Philosopher’s Stone<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. And the third has a bunch of magic items: <em>cloak of
elvenkind</em>, <em>folding boat</em>, <em>wand of alter self</em> with 23 charges. The cursed
objects mentioned earlier are also in this chest: a set of <em>prisoner’s dungeon
rings</em>, and a <em>robe of powerlesslness</em> disguised as a <em>robe of bones</em>.</p>

<p>When someone puts one of those rings on, the wearer of the <em>jailer’s dungeon
ring</em> that completes the set will instanly become aware of their location and
status. That wearer is Hei Fen, the last surviving Gray Spider, who will deduce
from this that her old hideout has been breached. I don’t know what a <em>robe of
bones</em> is supposed to do, but it doesn’t really matter because what this robe
actually does is act as a wearable No Mana/No Sanctity zone. Once worn, both
the rings and the robe can only be removed by magic like Remove Curse.</p>

<p>The skum wizard has the already mentioned wand of lightning bolts, plus a
<em>headband of intellect +2</em>, <em>amulet of natural armor +1</em>, and a <em>lesser extend
metamagic rod</em>.</p>

<h2 id="delving-the-dungeon">Delving the Dungeon</h2>

<p>Stealth is almost impossible here, just as it was in the cultist hideout on
level 1. There’s a bunch of skum right by the entrance, and it looks like any
sounds of combat would carry well enough under water to attract the attention of
anyone nearby.</p>

<p>The “brutal raid” approach is the only viable one, at least as I see it. The
most logical response for the skum when they first see the party is for the
level’s whole contingent to converge on the intruders! Here is how things will
likely play out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>PCs arrive on D1, the five skum there start a fight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The four skum on D8 notice the fight almost immediately, as there’s no barrier
between the two rooms. Three of them plus their two pet reefclaws join the
fight immediately, one runs to warn Ungol-Pagh. Depending on how you judge
things, this <em>could</em> be accomplished by manually triggering the alarm spell,
which reduces the wizard’s response time a bit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ungol-Pagh runs towards the fight as soon as he’s finished buffing himself,
arriving in a few rounds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The skum are all fanatics who fight to the death, so there’s no reason for them
to retreat and turtle up, save perhaps to lure the party to one of the other
monsters.</p>

<p>I don’t think any of the other monsters on the level would leave their
territories to fight in room D1, but that still leaves the PCs facing down nine
skum soldiers, two reefclaws, and Ungol-Pagh. If they’re really efficient they
might turn this into a fight against three distinct waves of enemies, but this
is likely to become one big subaquatic furball.</p>

<p>Well-prepared PCs could still take all the enemies here in one go, particularly
if they’re Dungeon Fantasy delvers, but now I see why some of the text expects
the PCs to retreat and take multiple tries to clear this level.</p>

<p>Clearing the skum and their allied monsters out of level 2 makes it possible for
the PCs to fix the pump and make the place habitable to air-breathers
again. Unless the party takes a serious beating from the defenses in this level,
they should also clear it in time to rescue the aquatic elf rangers, which gives
them a direct lead to the next adventure in the path.</p>

<p>That’s it for the final dungeon in Turn of the Torrent! The next post is going
to look at what the PCs likely accomplished in the adventure as a whole, and the
consequences of it.</p>

<p>Berbalangs are ghouls from filipino myth, and were first made into D&amp;D monsters
in an old issue of White Dwarf back in the OD&amp;D days. Here, they’re only on the
Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Despite the impy look of the picture, Berbalangs are Medium! They’re Immortal
Humanoids and Evil, but are not devils. The book doesn’t say much about their
in-setting origin, but what little description is there implies berbalangs live
in the world and not on the Astral Sea. They’re definitely sapient with Int 14,
and speak Supernal.</p>

<p>They feed on the flesh and bones of dead humanoids, but that’s just a carrier
for their real source of nourishment: the memories of the deceased. The creature
relives those memories when it sleeps, and derives sustenance from them. It
doesn’t matter whether the corpse is fresh or centuries old, the memories
encoded in its physical form will still serve as food just fine.</p>

<p>Some berbalangs take up residence in remote villages, where they make a deal
with the local leadership: instead of burying their dead, they offer them up to
the monster, presumably in exchange for protection against other threats. If no
one has died of natural causes recently, the berbalang instead demands a
sacrifice.</p>

<p>Berbalangs are solitary, but will occasionally share their lairs with other
monsters that like dwelling in tombs and crypts.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Berbalangs are Level 10 Solo Skirmishers with 408 HP. Their AC and Reflex are
strong for their level, and their Will is slightly weak. They have a ground
speed of 6 and a flight speed of 8.</p>

<p>The only reason I don’t consider them the most gimmicky monster I saw so far is
because I just reviewed beholders. You see, the berbalang’s main ability is
Summon Duplicate, an at-will minor action. While not bloodied, the creature can
create up to four psychic duplicates of itself. Creating a duplicate costs the
berbalang one quarter of its <em>current</em> hit points, which become that duplicate’s
HP. So a healthy berbalang can create three duplicates with 104, 76 and 57 HP
respectively, leaving itself with 171.</p>

<p>The duplicates have all the same statistics of the original, and the damage of
their attacks is psychic. They act as fully independent combatants and can be
targeted by PCs normally. A berbalang can use a standard action to either absorb
a duplicate and regain 50 HP, or detonate it. The resulting explosion affects
every enemy adjacent to the sacrificed duplicate with an attack that does
psychic damage, and which dazes even if it misses. This also causes 25 damage to
the original berbalang.</p>

<p>Once per round the creature can also deflect all damage and all negative effects
from an attack that hit it to one of its duplicates.</p>

<p>Its basic melee attack is downright prosaic next to all this: a claw attack that
suffers from the usual math problems. In a given turn, every duplicate will get
one of these, and they get sneak attacks against enemies flanked by two of them.</p>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 12: a berbalang, a gibbering mouther, and a
skeletal tomb guardian walk into a bar.</p>

<p>A lone berbalang might make an interesting boss battle against a level 7-8
party, at the end of an investigative adventure where they find out it’s
enslaving a village.</p>

<p>As we saw in a <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/23/force-screens.html">recent post</a>, force screens in GURPS work in a manner that is
almost, but not entirely unlike that of energy shields in popular game
franchises like Borderlands, Mass Effect, or Warframe. If you’re familiar with
these games and read GURPS for the first time, the differences might trip you up
a bit.</p>

<p>Energy shields in these games usually work like a separate pool of HP. Attacks
that hit your character take directly from this pool, which lets nothing through
until it’s completely depleted. Once that happens the character must avoid
getting hit for a few seconds before their shields start to regenerate, which in
turn takes a few more seconds. Games that give players a lot of insight into
their numbers tend to also provide lots of options to tweak your shield recharge
delay and recharge rate. Still, recovering your shields is always easier than
recovering your “real” HP, which requires healing items or powers.</p>

<p>These games also feature multiple damage types of varying effectiveness against
each type of defense. An attack that’s good at damaging shields will usually be
worse at damaging HP (and/or armor, if that’s a thing in the game), and
vice-versa.</p>

<p>How would this look like in GURPS? Let’s make an attempt to adapt these
mechanics.</p>

<h2 id="campaign-option-energy-shields">Campaign Option: Energy Shields</h2>

<p>This is a campaign option for settings which use force screens, making them work
in a more “video-game-like” fashion (described above). It’s good for campaigns
meant to emulate the games I discuss at the beginning of this post. If you’re
instead trying to model something like Star Trek shields, use the default rules
from Ultra-Tech instead.</p>

<p>Under these rules, Force Screens still provide the listed DR for the equipment
in question, but this DR is considered fully Ablative and ignores all armor
divisors. If an attack lowers the screen’s DR to 0, any excess damage is
lost. Attacks with the Surge modifier cause double damage to force screens, and
they protect from radiation as if it was damage. This does mean that an attack
that does “rad sur” damage would do triple damage to a force screen.</p>

<p>Shields recover at the usual rate of 10% per second, but they only start
recovering after the user spends 2 seconds without being hit by further
attacks. If the user is hit while the shield is mid-recovery, it takes another 2
seconds before it can start again.</p>

<p><em>Shield Overflow</em>: GMs who don’t want to bother with the bookkeeping can
eliminate both the 2-second recharge delay and the “no overflow” property of
force screens. This means that damage in excess of the shield’s DR applies
to the user, but the screen begins recovering on the very next turn.</p>

<p>All force screen variants from Ultra-Tech p. 191-192 <em>except</em> Kinetic and Energy
can still apply to force screens using this rule<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Remember Tom Tomorrow and the Robber Baron? Let’s see how their many
confrontations would have happened under this rule. As before, Tom Tomorrow has
a DR 60 personal force screen and a DR 30/15* armored space suit, and the Baron
has an increasingly absurd modern arsenal.</p>

<p>During the First National Bank robbery, each shot from the Baron’s 9mm pistol
(damage 2d+2 pi) would reduce the DR of Tom’s Force Screen by 9 on average. It
would take 7 shots to disable the force screen entirely, but until that happens
Tom is completely safe from the Baron’s gunfire. Tom can’t just stand there and
laugh at the villain anymore, but he can still easily make the arrest.</p>

<p>During the Second National Bank robbery, each shot from the baron’s assault
rifle (damage 5d pi) would reduce the DR of Tom’s Force Screen by 18! It will
only take four of them before Tom’s shields are down, forcing him to be a lot
more careful this time around. He can still take a lucky burst and survive
unscathed, but likely has to hide behind some hard cover once or twice to let
his shields recover. He’s still quite a bit safer than a mundane cop would be,
though.</p>

<p>During the Third National Bank Robbery, the Baron’s antitank grenade (damage
4d(10) cr exp) would reduce the screen’s DR by 14, but Tom himself would be
completely unaffected by the explosion! The Baron would likely be so surprised
by this Tom would easily be able to handcuff him for the third and final
time.</p>

<p>If the Baron somehow got ahold of a death ray (6d burn rad sur), each
shot from that weapon would do <em>63</em> damage to Tom’s shields on average, meaning
a single shot would be enough to destroy them! Tom himself would still be
unaffected, but subsequent shots would threathen him directly until he had a
couple of seconds to let his screen recharge at least a little. Luckily for him
and for Paragon City, futuristic beam weapons are totally outside the Baron’s
idiom.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>You probably heard of beholders before. You know, floaty spheres with a toothy
mouth and an arbitrarily large number of eyes. They’re kind of a big deal. I
believe they’ve been in the game since at least the BECMI era, and were one of
the handful of creatures declared off-limits by Wizards of the Coast when they
opened the door for third-party content through the OGL.</p>

<p>As classic boss monsters who nevertheless don’t quite get the same level of hype
as dragons, it’s quite possible more D&amp;D players have faced beholders than have
faced the monster mentioned in the game’s own title.</p>

<p>Both the Monster Manual and the Monster Vault contain stats for beholders. We’ll
look at both in parallel.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The lore bits in the monster manual say barely more than the first two sentences
in this article. Beholders are among the most feared monsters of all, and are
so egotistical they normally can’t get along even with others of their
kind. They like to rule over “lesser” creatures, a category which includes
pretty much anyone other than themselves.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault elaborates on the above. It says beholders come from the Far
Realm, but that unlike lots of other aberrant creatures that either cross over
into our world by accident or to cause destruction, they come here as
conquerors. There are many beholder varieties, and this diversity is further
increased by the fact that some of then are changed by the passage from the Far
Realm into the world.</p>

<p>All beholders are anti-social megalomaniacs, though, believing themselves the
rightful rulers of everything they see (and yes, the book does make the pun that
they see a lot with all those eyes). Beholders don’t really have allies - they
have minions they lord over or masters they constantly plot to overthrow,
Starscream-like.</p>

<p>Other interesting beholder facts gathered by osmosis from other editions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Their flight is natural, not magic (their organisms contain pockets of
lighter-than-air gas).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beholders reproduce asexually, by nightmare. By this I mean that when a
beholder has a particularly bad nightmare, that nightmare will manifest
physically and take the form of a new beholder. No wonder they’re so
antisocial. Each beholder is some other beholder’s literal worst nightmare.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You decide which of these are true in your game, of course.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Beholders are aberrant magical beasts. All are highly intelligent and of Evil
alignment. They move via flight, and can hover. With all those eyes, they’re
trained in Perception, have darkvision, and all-around vision, which means they
can’t be flanked.</p>

<p>Their signature ability are the infamous eye rays, both from the little eyes on
stalks and from the large central one. Each variety has a different set. They’re
all ranged attacks, but they don’t provoke opportunity attacks from PCs. Let’s
look at them sorted by level:</p>

<h3 id="beholder-gauth">Beholder Gauth</h3>

<p>This is a fun-sized version from the Monster Vault. The only Medium beholder,
it’s Level 5 Elite Artillery with 102 HP. As a standard action it can bite or
fire two of its eye rays at different targets, chosen from its list of four
possible options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The fire ray targets Reflex and does fire damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exhaustion ray targets Fortitude, does somewhat less necrotic damage and
  weakens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sleep ray targets Fort, does no damage and slows, with the condition
  worsening to unconsciousness on the first failed save.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The telekinesis ray targets Fort, does no damage and slides a target 4
  squares.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As a minor action, it fires a beam from its central eye that targets Will, does
no damage and immobilizes.</p>

<p>The gauth’s non-damaging beams means it works better when together with other
monsters that can take advantage of them. I guess that as the weakest beholder,
it’s either going to rely more on its servants, or it’s going to be made a
servant of a more powerful villain.</p>

<h3 id="beholder">Beholder</h3>

<p>The classic model, from the Monster Vault. It’s a Large aberrant magical beast,
and a Level 9 Solo Artillery menace with 392 HP. It flies a bit slower than the
gauth (Speed 4 instead of Speed 6), which fits since it’s more of a battleship
than an agile corvette.</p>

<p>For its standard actions, we have the standard bite, which does decent damage
but it’s not likely to see use if the beholder has its way. The main attraction
are its <em>ten different eye beams</em>. It gets to fire any two of its choice against
different targets per standard action.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Charm: Targets Will, no damage, dominates for a turn.</li>
  <li>Wounding: Targets Fortitude, straight necrotic damage.</li>
  <li>Sleep: Targets Will. No damage, immobilizes, and that turns into
unconciousness after the first failed save.</li>
  <li>Telekinesis Targets Fort, slides 4 squares.</li>
  <li>Slowing: Targets Reflex, does necrotic damage and slows.</li>
  <li>Brilliant: Targets Will, does radiant damage and blinds.</li>
  <li>Terror: Targets Will, does psychic damage and pushes the target its
speed.</li>
  <li>Petrifying: Targets Fort, does no damage but petrifies right away! This is a
(save ends) effect, so it’s not quite fight-ending but it’s still
scary. After you save from the petrification, you’re still immobilized until
you pass another save.</li>
  <li>Death: Targets Fortitude. More necrotic damage than the wounding ray. If it
bloodies the target (or hits an already bloodied target) it sets off a chain
reaction: the target becomes dazed; on the first failed save, that turns into
dazed and weakened; on the second, the target <em>dies</em>.</li>
  <li>Disintegration: Targets Fortitude, does untyped damage and 10 ongoing
damage.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the beholder is bloodied, it gains an Eye Ray Frenzy that recharges on a 6
and allows it to make 3 beam attacks instead of 2.</p>

<p>Those are just the standard actions. As a minor action, the beholder can use its
traditional anti-magic central eye, a close blast 5 attack that targets Will and
does no damage, but prevents affected targets from using encounter and daily
powers for a turn. Yes, it <em>can</em> prevent purely martial characters from using
their special tricks, but that’s easily intepreted as a sort of enervating
effect instead of or in addition to the usual magic-dampening.</p>

<p>Finally, any enemy that starts its turn within 5 squares of the beholder gets
tagged by a random eye ray a the start of the enemy’s own turn. That’s why
they’re numbered! Roll 1d10 and watch your players pray they only get the
vanilla wounding beam.</p>

<h3 id="beholder-eye-of-flame">Beholder Eye of Flame</h3>

<p>This one exists only on the Monster Manual. It’s Level 13 Elite Artillery, with
204 HP. It has the same “hit everyone nearby with a random eye ray” power as the
classic Beholder, but here it’s written up as an aura. It flies at speed 6, and
is all about fire.</p>

<p>Being a MM1 monster, it shows some of the early rough design issues: its bite is
ridiculously weak instead of doing level-appropriate damage like the two
previous beholders. It has three different eye beams, and can use two of them
against different creatures per standard action. At least one of those must be
the fire ray, but the other can be chosen freely.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fire: Fire damage vs. Reflex.</li>
  <li>Telekinesis: As above.</li>
  <li>Fear: Targets Will, and works similarly to the fear ray from the classic
beholder, but bestows an additional -2 penalty to attacks (save ends).</li>
</ol>

<p>It minor-action Central Eye power <em>automatically</em> gives a target Vulnerable 10
to fire, and makes them take 5 ongoing fire damage if they take fire damage from
any source. This is a (save ends) condition, so the eye of flame will try to
saddle every member of the party with it eventually. That more than makes up for
its lack of eye ray variety.</p>

<p>When bloodied, and once again when it dies, the eye of flame lets loose a fiery
burst that targets Reflex and deals fire damage to everyone on a Close
burst 2. I guess its buoyant gasses are more flamable than usual.</p>

<h3 id="beholder-eye-tyrant">Beholder Eye Tyrant</h3>

<p>The strongest of the lot, and present in both the Monster Manual and Monster
Vault. The two versions are mostly identical aside from updated math.</p>

<p>The Eye Tyrant is a Level 19 Solo Artillery weapons platform, essentially a
vastly up-gunned classic beholder. The bite on the MM version is evey more
ridiculously weak than that of the Eye of Flame, but the MV version strengthens
it to what’s expected for a level 19 monster (MM: 2d6+1; MV: 4d8+7).</p>

<p>The Eye Tyrant’s ten eye rays are slightly different:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Searing: Targets Reflex, straight radiant damage.</li>
  <li>Withering: Targets Fortitude, necrotic damage and ongoing 10 necrotic damage.</li>
  <li>Sleep: Targets Will, no damage but causes instant unconsciousness (save
ends).</li>
  <li>Telekinesis: identical to the classic beholder’s.</li>
  <li>Hold: Targets Reflex, no damage but restrains the target (save
ends). Restrained is Immobilized’s big brother: the former only roots you to
the spot, the latter prevents all action.</li>
  <li>Confusion: Targets Will, does no damage but forces the target to charge the
nearest ally it can charge.</li>
  <li>Terror: The MM version is similar to the classic beholder’s. The MV version
does psychic damage and makes the target move its speed away from the eye
tyrant. This is different from a push because the target chooses where they
end up. And it that destination is still within 4 squares of the beholder,
the target takes psychic damage again!</li>
  <li>Petrifying: Targets fortitude and induces gradual petrification: slowed,
worsening to immobilized and petrified with failed saves. Petrification this
time is <em>permanent</em>.</li>
  <li>Death: Like the classic beholder’s but with lots more necrotic damage.</li>
  <li>Disintegration: Like the classic beholder’s, but ongoing damage is <em>2d20</em>
instead of a flat 10.</li>
</ol>

<p>The eye tyrant’s eye ray frenzy allows it to fire four beams instead of the
usual 2 on a recharge 6 timer.</p>

<p>Its minor-action Central Eye blast dazes on the MM version, and disables
encounter and daily powers on the MV version. It still has random eye rays.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’ve never used beholders in a game before, but I still have fond memories of
them from the D&amp;D cartoon and arcade games. Their 4e stat blocks give me pretty
much the same feel as the ones from previous editions, since those also had the
entire explanation for what each eye ray did as an itemized list.</p>

<p>Fourth Edition shies away from instant save-or-die effects, so beholders end up
with a lot fewer of those. Still, the classic beholder has one in the new
“gradual doom” flavor, and the Eye Tyrant has two. The level 9 beholder is
nastier than it seems too, because it’s a suitable boss battle for a party of
level 6 adventurers who won’t have easy access to resurrection yet.</p>
