<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As we saw back in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/08/23/colossus.html">Colossus entry for the Monster Manual</a>, colossi are at
the top of the tech tree for traditional constructs, and only gods and
near-divine spellcasters have the power to create them. They’re the kind of
thing that was used as a weapon in the Dawn War. Well, here we learn that the
gods weren’t the only side of that war that could make colossi.</p>

<p>In the post linked above, I made a reference to the giant monsters from the
Shadow of the Colossus game. The primordial colossus we’re looking at here fits
them much better than the godforged variant from the first Manual.</p>

<p>Most primordial colossi were created at the time of the Dawn War, and being as
ageless as their creators they still exist today. Some roam the planes seeking
to fulfill the orders of their long-gone masters, but others lie dormant looking
for all the world like shattered ruins or broken parts of the landscape. When
someone approaches them, they rise and smash the intruder.</p>

<p>The magic that goes into a primordial colossus is a little wilder and less
controlled than the one that goes into the god-forged variant. The principles
behind it are such that a primordial colossus might be created <em>by accident</em>
in any event that causes the release of a massive amount of elemental
energy. This includes the awakening or destruction of a mighty elemental
being. It’s also possible for an epic spellcaster to acquire and perform the
ritual to create one of these constructs.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Once again we get a single stat block here, so let’s get right to it.</p>

<h3 id="primordial-colossus">Primordial Colossus</h3>

<p>This baby is a Huge Elemental Animate with the Construct keyword, and a Level 29
Elite Brute with 640 HP. It’s immune to disease, fear, poison and sleep, and has
a Variable Elemental Resistance 15 switchable 3 times per encounter. Its ground
speed is 10.</p>

<p>Primordial colossi really lean into that mechanic for composite energy
damage. They have an <strong>Elemental Presence</strong> aura (5) that deals 15 damage of the
“acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder” type to anyone caught inside. You
need resistance to all five types in order to not take full damage from it.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>slams</strong> do physical damage, but they likely prefer to use a
<strong>Colossal Slam</strong> maneuver (close blast 3 vs. AC), which does the same damage
over an area and triggers a secondary attack vs. Fortitude that does a bit of
extra five-type elemental damage.</p>

<p>When an enemy moves adjacent to the colossus, it can use a <strong>Reactive Kick</strong> as
a reaction, targetting Fortitude, doing a good bit of five-type damage, pushing
the target 4 squares and knocking it prone. This recharges once the colossus is
first bloodied.</p>

<p>Staying away does you no good, since it can throw <strong>Primordial Stones</strong> (Ranged
20 vs. Reflex) that do only a bit less damage than the slam and have a secondary
area attack (Close Burst 5 vs. Fortitude) which does that sweet five-type
damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The two sample encounters have primordial colossi guarding ancient ruins
alongside other similarly powerful apotropaics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 26: 1 primordial colossus, 2 great flameskulls, 1 slaughterstone
hammerer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 27: 1 primordial colossus, 1 primordial naga.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe an epic adventure centered on Far Realm opposition could have some
horrible aberrant secret guarded by both godforged and primordial colossi -
something so terrible the gods and primordials actually joined forces to
protect.</p>

<p>Mechanically, I find those Big Balls of Elemental Damage in the colossus’ stat
block to be a lot of fun. It’s so hard to resist you’d get the same result by
just using straight physical damage, but describing it this way reinforces the
elemental nature of the creature… and you get to see the look on your players’
faces as you announce they took acid, cold, fire lightning and thunder damage.</p>

<p>As far as I know both cockatrices and basilisks are based on the same vague lump
of medieval folklore about an animal that can turn you to stone. The exact name,
description and proportion of snake/lizard/chicken traits this animal has varies
in each specific story. D&amp;D, of course, turned each possible name for the same
thing into a totally different monster. They’ve been in the game since at least
the days of BECMI.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Cockatrices are bird-like monsters whose bite can turn a victim to stone. Unlike
a lot of other deadly creatures, though, they don’t actually seem to be
predators. Their petrification powers are a defense mechanism, which they will
use while trying to run away from whatever enemy threatens them. So yeah, you
could say cockatrices are a bit chicken.</p>

<p>Still, cockatrice lairs tend to have the little statue gardens common to
petrifying monsters, all likely made from predators who thought they could
handle it or from innocent creatures who had no idea whose lawn they were
stepping on. I imagine careful adventurers can just avoid the area entirely if
they see the statues, though there are reasons they would seek it out instead:
the freshly plucked feathers of a cockatrice can be used to brew a potion that
undoes petrification if applied within 24 hours. A single dose requires a whole
cockatrice’s worth of feathers, which in turn likely requires killing the beast.</p>

<p>Cockatrices are themselves immune to petrification, which makes them good pets
for medusas. The book also says other reptilians, like lizardfolk and yuan-ti,
also make use of them. They’re definitely easier to handle than a basilisk.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We only get a single stat block here, so let’s get right to it.</p>

<h3 id="cockatrice">Cockatrice</h3>

<p>This is a Small Natural Beast and a Level 5 Skirmisher with 63 HP and low-light
vision. It’s immune to petrification as discussed earlier, and has a ground
speed of 4 and a flight speed of 6 (clumsy). As a reminder, the Clumsy keyword
means the creature has a -4 to attacks when using that movement mode.</p>

<p>The cockatrice’s basic attack is its <strong>bite</strong>, which is kinda weak but triggers
a secondary attack vs. Fortitude. A hit there does no damage and slows the
victim (save ends). This worsens to Immobilized on the first failed save, and to
“permanent until cured” petrification on the second.</p>

<p>If an enemy moves adjacent to the cockatrice it can use <strong>Buffeting Wings</strong>
(recharge 4-6) as an interrupt, which allows it to bite the triggering enemy and
shift 3 squares.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Given their low level, cockatrices are likely to be the first petrifying
monsters a party encounters. They’re simple, but their main attack is scary
enough to make up for that. They could be made into higher-level threats if, in
addition to leveling them up, you made them more mobile and gave them an extra
special attack.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 5: 2 cockatrices and a trio of lizardfolk using
them as attack animals.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In any edition of D&amp;D it’s easy to get obsessed with its fiend taxonomy, but
there are always some creatures that end up slipping through its cracks. Take
chaos shards, for example. They form spontaneously at the edges of the terrible
maelstrom that exists at the border between the Elemental Chaos and the Abyss,
when the energies of those two planes clash in a particular way.</p>

<p>These crystalline entities are sapient, violent, and cruel. Since they don’t
have any biological needs to distract them, they’re quite content with roaming
around and blasting everything they see with elemental energies. I imagine they
give preference to targets that can scream and suffer.</p>

<p>Despite having themes tied to the Abyss, being Chaotic Evil, and even having
variable elemental resistance, these things are not demons. They do have some
sort of metaphysical connection to the Shard of Pure Evil at the bottom of the
Abyss, though. Legend has it that the most powerful chaos shards are splinters
of that legendary blight upon the universe.</p>

<p>Some wizards trap chaos shards for use as power sources, which I bet is not at
all dangerous or likely to result in death and suffering.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get a handful of stat blocks for shards covering from the mid-Heroic to the
mid-Paragon tiers. All are Medium Elemental Magical Beasts. They have
Darkvision, immunities to disease and poison, and a variable elemental
resistance similar to that of demons.</p>

<p>They’re all Artillery monsters, and their movement is fairly slow, though they
do fly. Most are strongly aspected towards a specific element, and have damaging
auras that get a bit stronger if their enemies are suffering from some condition.</p>

<h3 id="storm-shard">Storm Shard</h3>

<p>This Level 4 Artillery shard has 44 HP and aspected towards lightning and
thunder. Its ground and fly speeds are 3, and it projects a <strong>Static Storm</strong>
aura (2) that deals 3 lightning and thunder damage to those enemies caught
inside. This rises to 5 if the enemy is immobilized. They have the standard
senses and immunities, and their variable resistance is 5 and can be switched
once per encounter.</p>

<p>They fire <strong>Shock Bolts</strong> (vs. Fortitude) that do some lightning damage and
“strongly incentivize” the target to move: if they don’t end their next turn at
least 4 squares away from their current position, they take lightning damage
roughly equal to triple that of the initial attack.</p>

<p>If forced into melee, the shard attacks with <strong>Thunder Strikes</strong> (vs. Fortitude)
which deal thunder damage and knock the target prone if it’s bloodied.</p>

<p>When killed, storm shards explode! This <strong>Storm Shatter</strong> (Close Burst 3
vs. Fortitude) attack deals lightning and thunder damage, pushes the targets 3
squares, and deafens them (save ends).</p>

<p>A note on damage types: the expression “lightning and thunder damage” above
denotes an attack with a single damage roll that is of both types at
once. Targets use the smallest of their relevant elemental resistances against
this damage. In this specific example, someone with Lightning Resistance 10 and
Thunder Resistance 5 would subtract only 5 from the rolled damage. Someone that
resists only one of the component types takes full damage.</p>

<h3 id="death-shard">Death Shard</h3>

<p>Aspected towards necrotic energies, Death Shards are Level 8 Artillery with 71
HP. It has all the standard traits including Variable Resistance 5
(1/encounter), and also Necrotic Resistance 10. Its speed is 3.</p>

<p>This thing projects a <strong>Death Shadow</strong> aura (2) that deals necrotic damage to
enemies caught inside, which increases if the enemies are slowed. It fires
<strong>Death Bolts</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) that deal necrotic damage and slow
(save ends). In melee, it cuts you with a <strong>Razor Shard</strong>, a regular basic
attack dealing physical damage.</p>

<p>It’s a bit less volatile than the Storm Shard, but still dangerous: when hit by
a critical, it reacts with a <strong>Critical Fracture</strong> (close burst 2
vs. Fortitude), which deals necrotic damage and weakens.</p>

<p>If the death shard resists damage (i.e, if it’s hit with something covered by
its resistances), all of its attacks deal extra damage until the end of its next
turn. This trait is named <strong>Life to Death</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="flame-shard">Flame Shard</h3>

<p>These Level 12 Artillery monsters have an even 100 HP and are a bit more literal
about this whole artillery business than most of their compatriots. Their speed
is 4 and their variable resistance 10 (switchable twice per encounter).</p>

<p>The flame shard’s main ranged attack is <strong>Flame Burst</strong> (area burst 2 within 10
vs. Reflex) which is basically like an at-will fireball, though its damage is
rather low. In melee it stabs people with a <strong>Burning Shard</strong> that does fire
damage, and it projects a <strong>Heat Wave</strong> aura (2) that deals fire damage and
inflicts a -2 penalty against ongoing fire damage.</p>

<p>When killed they explode in a final attack that’s much like a Flame Burst
centered on themselves, and which also does ongoing fire damage (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="prismatic-shard">Prismatic Shard</h3>

<p>Living proof that “Radiant” doesn’t always mean “Good”… it can also mean “evil
disco ball”! These are Level 16 Artillery monsters with 123 HP. To the standard
list of shard immunities they add an immunity to <em>radiant damage</em>, making the
party’s divine characters very sad. Their variable resistance is 10 and can be
switched four times per encounter.</p>

<p>Their aura (2) is named <strong>Prismatic Corona</strong>. It does radiant damage and
inflicts a -2 penalty to all saving throws during made during the affected
enemy’s turn.</p>

<p>All of the Prismatic Shard’s attacks do radiant damage. The melee <strong>Prism
Flare</strong> (vs. Reflex) has nothing else going on for it. The <strong>Iridescent Bolt</strong>
(ranged 20 vs. Will) also blinds for a turn. Its <strong>Flashing Colors</strong> (close
burst 3 vs. Will; minor action) do no damage but daze (save ends). And the
<strong>Prismatic Shatter</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Will) attack it uses when it dies also
blinds (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>As I said before, chaos shards don’t have frail organic bodies to worry about,
so they can live solely for the fun of seeing people explode from their
elemental blasts. They hang out with creatures who are equally appreciative of
this highly refined form of entertainment, including slaads, demons, and certain
types of Internet troll.</p>

<p>They can also be summoned and controlled through elemental magic, which makes
them popular with certain spellcasters.</p>

<p>The sample encounters are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: 2 death shards, a bloodseep demon, and 2 evistros.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 1 prismatic shard, 3 blue slaads, and 1 green slaad.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Chaos shards fulfill the important mechanical niche of providing artillery
support for demons and slaads, since these monster types are all about melee and
tend to lack ranged firepower. They also further confuse the taxonomy of “things
from the Abyss”, something which I’m finding more and more interesting as I
progress through these monster books.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Monstrous centipedes have been in the game since the beginning, and are based on
real-world animals. Let’s see what 4e makes of them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>I only recently realized D&amp;D centipedes aren’t as fantastical as I always
thought. There are thousands of real-world centipede species, and the ones I was
familiar with were pretty small and generally not dangerous to people. However,
some species can reach up to 30cm (a foot!) in length, and have a poisonous bite
that might cause fever and chills in people. It’s possible for someone to be
allergic to centipede venom, and in that case their bite can cause anaphylatic
shock.</p>

<p>So the only fantastical thing about the D&amp;D centipede in early editions of the
game was the fact that its venom was always save-or-die. Its size was realistic,
and so was its venom in later editions when it became less deadly. Of course,
the game also had truly giant centipedes which were entirely fantastical, and
this remains true here.</p>

<p>Centipedes can be found in woodlands, caves, and lots of other
environments. They’re ferocious predators and aggressive enough to attack much
larger creatures if they feel threatened. The larger specimens are of a scale
large enough to see humanoids as potential prey, too.</p>

<p>Despite all this aggressiveness, it seems lots of sapient creatures are able to
keep them as pets and guard animals. I suspect magic might be
involved. Centipedes are particularly popular pets for Torog worshippers, who
consider them sacred.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Centipedes are Natural Beasts of varying size. The game gives them Darkvision,
though it might be more accurate to give them blindsight instead. The authors
didn’t consider a single foot-long centipede to be a worthy threat, so we get
stats for a swarm of them and for a giant specimen.</p>

<h3 id="centipede-swarm">Centipede Swarm</h3>

<p>This Medium swarm is a Level 2 Brute with 44 HP. It has ground and climb speeds
of 6, with Spider Climb (which allows them to cling to ceilings). It has all
standard swarm traits, taking half damage from melee and ranged attacks, and 10
extra damage from close and area attacks.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura (1) deals 3 automatic damage to each enemy caught
inside, +2 per centipede swarm adjacent to the enemy. This is deceptively
dangerous, particularly if you assume multiple swarm auras stack! An enemy
adjacent to a single swarm will take 5 damage at the start of their turn. An
enemy adjacent to 2 of them would take 14, or 7 if the auras don’t stack.</p>

<p>The swarm’s basic attack is a <strong>Swarm of Mandibles</strong> (vs. Reflex), which deals a
little bit of physical damage, which increases by 1 with each adjacent centipede
swarm. A hit also deals ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends). If the enemy is
already taking ongoing poison damage, they’re weakened (save ends).</p>

<p>If the swarm is hit by an area or close attack, their <strong>Survival Instinct</strong>
causes them to shift 3 squares as a reaction.</p>

<p>An interesting monster: despite being a brute, its attack is kinda weak. Most of
the damage comes from the swarm aura, particularly if you assume multiple
centipede swarm auras stack. You’ll never encounter just one swarm either -
there should be at least two in the group to enjoy those cool exponential
bonuses. More than two might be pushing a bit, though.</p>

<h3 id="centipede-scuttler">Centipede Scuttler</h3>

<p>A proper giant, this is a single Medium individual. It’s a Level 4 Skirmisher
with 51 HP and both ground and climb speeds of 8. Can’t run away from it.</p>

<p>Its <strong>bite</strong> targets AC and does a little more damage than the swarm’s, but has
the same riders. Against a weakened creature (which likely got that way from its
venom) it can <strong>Feed</strong>, dealing roughly triple the damage of a basic bite.</p>

<p>As an at-will move action, the Scuttler can, well, <strong>Scuttle</strong>, which allows it
to shift 4 squares. When it shifts into an ally’s space while scuttling, that
space doesn’t count as one of the 4 squares. Be sure to give it lots of
buddies when building the encounter.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get two encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 1 ankheg, 2 bloodthorn vines, and 2 centipede swarms. What rotten
luck that all of them would be hanging out next to each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 2 scuttlers, 1 gnoll huntmaster, 2 gnoll marauders. So they keep more
than hyenas as pets.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I liked the old save-or-die centipedes and these feel properly scary as well,
while also being distinct from all the other giant creepy crawlies.</p>

<p>Centaurs are inspired by Greek myth, in which they were The Worst (with rare
exceptions). They’ve been in D&amp;D since at least the days of BECMI, which even
had a supplement that made them playable.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Fourth Edition centaurs are a good deal nicer than their mythological
counterparts. Their culture venerates nature in its wilder aspects, and they
have an extensive martial tradition. In other words: they’re quite rowdy and
love a good fight. Kord and Melora are a lot more popular with them than
Corellon, who is otherwise the go-to fey deity. I don’t know if the lore of the
primal spirits had been finalized at this point, but centaurs also work great as
primal spirit worshippers.</p>

<p>Centaurs like to live in areas that contain vast plains or steppes, but they
like to build their settlements on hills or inside caves. The combination gives
them a defensible position surrounded by clear sight lines all around, and also
gives them the large space they need to run around and to grow their food.</p>

<p>Centaurs are not typically evil, but they’re territorial, mistrustful of
strangers, and hate people who despoil nature. Dealing with them peacefully
requires careful diplomacy that begins beyond arrow range. The prospective
ambassador should spend great effort making their approach both obvious and
obviously non-threatening. Once the centaurs recognize you for a friend, though,
they can become steadfast allies.</p>

<p>Most centaur settlements are located in the Feywild, though there are some in
the world bordering elven forests. Centaur law is simple, and most crimes carry
banishment and exile as their punishment. Exiled centaur criminals could easily
end up working with other villains.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Centaurs are Large Fey Humanoids, with low-light vision and a ground speed
of 8. They have two signature abilities. The first is that their basic attacks
do an extra die of damage when used in a charge. The other is a reaction called
<strong>Quick Kick</strong>, which allows them to make a free kick attack against an enemy
who moves into a position that flanks the centaur.</p>

<h3 id="centaur-hunter">Centaur Hunter</h3>

<p>If this was a PC, it would be a Twin Strike-spamming ranger. Hunters are Level
12 Artillery with 96 HP and all standard centaur traits.</p>

<p>They fight with classic horse archer tactics, using their superior mobility to
keep away and fire on the move. Their main ranged attack is <strong>Lightning-Fast
Arrows</strong> (range 25/50 vs. AC), a standard action that allows them to shoot
twice. Though each individual arrow has low damage, the two combined almost line
up with MM3 math.</p>

<p>Alternatively, they can use a <strong>Charge Arrow</strong> (ranged 25/50 vs. Fortitude) to
do a bit more single-arrow damage, push the target 3 squares, and knock it
prone. I’d say it’s not worth it unless the target is near a cliff or the hunter
has melee buddies that would benefit from a prone enemy.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the hunter can speed up even more and deliver a <strong>Triple
Shot</strong> (ranged 25/50 vs. AC), making three attacks whose individual damage is
a bit higher.</p>

<p>If someone does manage to engage the hunter in melee, it can defend itself with
a <strong>bastard sword</strong>… but it doesn’t really need to, since the <strong>Close-Combat
Archer</strong> trait makes it not provoke opportunity attacks from the targets of its
shots.</p>

<h3 id="centaur-ravager">Centaur Ravager</h3>

<p>The most likely melee buddy for the hunter, this is a barbarian-type. Ravagers
are Level 12 Brutes with 150 HP and all standard centaur traits. They fight in
melee with their <strong>bastard swords</strong>, and they can use a <strong>Berserk Rush</strong> (melee
1 vs. Fortitude; recharges when first bloodied) to do even more damage on a
charge, push the target 2 squares, and knock them prone. When first bloodied,
they also use <strong>Brash Retaliation</strong>, a free action attack that does high damage
and pushes the targets 2 squares.</p>

<p>All of this suggests shock cavalry tactics: charge, fight in place for a bit,
then move away and charge again. Though I guess ravagers have no problem staying
in the thick of it either.</p>

<h3 id="centaur-mystic">Centaur Mystic</h3>

<p>A wise primal or divine spellcaster, the mystic takes a priestly role in centaur
culture and advises the community on its duties towards nature and the
spirits. In combat they use plant- and earth-themed magic.</p>

<p>Mystics are Level 13 Controllers with 132 HP and all standard centaur
traits. They wield Reach 2 <strong>quarterstaffs</strong> which also acts as implements for
their magic. The mainstay here is <strong>Rootwhip Staff</strong>, a melee spell that targets
Reflex and does the same damage as a basic staff attack, but also slides the
target 3 squares and slows it (save ends).</p>

<p>The mystic’s ranged options are big guns with limited ammo:</p>

<p><strong>Ancestral Chargers</strong> is a Close Blast 5 that presumably summons ancestors
spirits and has funky mechanics. It targets both Fortitude and Will: you make a
single attack roll against both defenses. If the attack beats the target’s Will,
they take high psychic damage; if it beats the target’s Fortitude they’re
knocked prone and pushed 2 squares. This spell recharges when a friendly centaur
within 10 squares drops to 0 hit points, which implies the recharge comes from
summoning their recently departed spirit for one last strike.</p>

<p><strong>Biting Earth</strong> (Area Burst 2 within 10; recharges when first bloodied) creates
a zone that lasts for a turn and can be sustained with standard actions. The
biting earth zone immobilizes all enemies within. These enemies can choose to
take 3d8 damage to save against the effect as a free action. There’s no regular
save, so if the enemy doesn’t want to take damage they’re stuck in place while
the zone lasts. When the zone is sustained, the mystic can choose to move it up
to 3 squares.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can also use <strong>Mystic Resonance</strong> (minor action), which
affects all allies within 10 squares. It heals them for 10 HP and allows them to
roll a save.</p>

<p>Looks like you want to open with Ancestral Chargers here, and then use Biting
Earth to try and hold the PCs in place for the ravagers and hunters to do their
stuff.</p>

<h3 id="centaur-fey-charger">Centaur Fey Charger</h3>

<p>Fey chargers are significantly more powerful than the other centaurs we saw up
until now, being better fighters and having a host of storm-themed powers. This
would fit a warden or a paladin of Kord.</p>

<p>They’re level 18 Soldiers with 172 HP and all standard centaur traits. They wear
mail and carry a shield in addition to the traditional centaur bastard sword,
none of which slows them down.</p>

<p>They can fire <strong>Stabs of Lightning</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Reflex) do to lighthning
damage at range while closing in, but the main event is the melee. Once an
opening presents itself they close in with a <strong>Thunder Charge</strong>, a strong attack
that does a mix of physical and lightning damage and carries a secondary Close
Burst 2 attack that targets Fortitude, does thunder damage, knocks prone and
marks for a turn.</p>

<p>Once engaged, their <strong>sword</strong> attacks mark for a turn, and they can use
<strong>Thunder Hooves</strong> (melee 1 vs. Fortitude) as a reaction to attack anyone who
ignores the mark and do thunder damage to them.</p>

<h3 id="centaur-campaigner">Centaur Campaigner</h3>

<p>A legendary commander and champion of the centaur people with decades of
military experience. The campaigner is a Level 25 Soldier (Leader) with all
standard centaur traits and a good deal of supernatural wind- and storm-themed
abilities. It wears plate, and carries a shield and a longsword.</p>

<p>The bonus charge damage of the <strong>longsword</strong> attack is thunder, and the
Campaigner is all about that glorious impossible charge. Its <strong>Light Hoof</strong>
trait allows it to ignore all difficult terrain, and <strong>Sky Bound</strong> (at-will free
action) allows it to fly for the duration of its next move, though it must land
at the end. If that isn’t possible the centaur will gently float down to the
floor, so it doesn’t take fall damage but you might say its momentum gets kinda
ruined.</p>

<p>When the campaigner’s charge hits it can use <strong>Three Thunder Assault</strong> to allow
two allies within 10 squares of itself to charge as a free action. These charges
deal a bit of bonus thunder damage as well. Combine this with other centaurs
(maybe even other campaigners), and you have an instant massive cavalry charge!</p>

<p>Once engaged, <strong>Shock Trooper</strong> gives the campaigner a small bonus to damage
while it’s adjacent to more than one foe. It can also use a maneuver called
<strong>Hoofed Tornado</strong> to perform strong attacks on all enemies in a Close Burst 1,
knocking them prone on a hit and marking them for a turn as an effect. This
recharges when it’s first bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Centaurs might be found as members of most fey-themed encounter groups, working
alongside elves, eladrin, satyrs, and so on. I imagine the nastier sort of
centaur might also work alongside shady customers such as banshrae, hags, or
fomorians. For some of those you might want to do some level adjustment either
of the centaurs themselves or their associates.</p>

<p>If you want your party to meet centaurs early, knocking 10 levels from the
centaur hunter, ravager and mystic would be a good start, making them
early-heroic NPCs/enemies.</p>

<p>The sample encounter we get is Level 23: a centaur campaigner plus two eladrin
ghaeles of winter mounted on fell wyverns.</p>

<p>I like these centaurs! They can be either friend or foe depending on how they’re
treated, and in any case the PCs might find a way to talk to them instead of
fighting right away. They’re exactly what I look for in a NPC humanoid
species. Their stat blocks also work well at giving the impression of a people
for whom infantry tactics and cavalry tactics are the same thing.</p>
