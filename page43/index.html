            <p>We already lightly touched upon medusas on the entry for gorgons (which, in D&amp;D,
are entirely unrelated). They’re based on Greek Myth, where Medusa was an
individual, the only mortal among the semi-divine Gorgon sisters. I see them on
the Rules Cyclopedia, so they’ve been around since at least BECMI and probably
since the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As is common with creatures based on singular entities from Greek Myth, D&amp;D
medusas are an entire species of humanoids with snake-like features. Females
have the iconic hair snakes, and their gaze can petrify victims. Males are
completely bald, and their gazes can “poison the mind and body”.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual portrays medusas as a haugthy and ambitious people. They live
in small groups, but their ambition drives them to seek money and power in the
societies of others. Evil medusas turn up as assassin guild masters or
terrifying nobles, but you also get nicer ones working as eccentric veiled
scholars and alchemists. Eberron has medusas make up part of the elite in the
monster nation of Droaam, so you can have medusa ambassadors and such.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault, as usual goes a bit harder on the evil angle and says that
medusas are universally regarded as unnatural by all the other sapients. Rumors
and myths abound about their origins, and run along two main lines. One says
they were wholesome/wicked people who got punished/rewarded by Zehir with their
current forms. The other says they were the result of yuan-ti genetic
experiments, originally meant to serve as a slave race. Villainous medusas do
often worship Zehir, the snake god of treachery and snakes, and they often have
cordial relations with yuan-ti, who are one of the few other peoples they are
said to truly respect.</p>

<p>Medusas like to decorate the area around their lairs as demarcation and
warning. There’s the classic statue gardens, of course, and males also like to
paint the walls with the blood of their victims.</p>

<figure class="right">

</figure>

<p>The Monster Vault also turns them into another of those evil matriarchies where
males are oppressed, with only those few who are immune to petrification being
singled out for special treatment. The Monster Manual makes no mention of this,
and says every medusa is immune to petrification regardless of gender.</p>

<p>In combat, medusas use weapons, with a preference for swords and bows. Their
blades and arrows are often coated in poison derived from the their own saliva
or blood. Someone who has been petrified by a medusa can be brought back to life
by the application of a few drops of that medusa’s blood to the victim’s
lips. While the text assumes you’ll kill the medusa to get that blood, I don’t
think that’s a hard requirement. If you do kill it, you must apply the blood to
the victims within 24 hours.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Medusas are Medium Natural Humanoids. All are immune to petrification, and have
some degree of poison resistance. They also have a gaze attack, which can be
either petrification or venom depending on the individual.</p>

<p>Gaze mechanics are different in both books. MM gazes are standard action
attacks, to which blind creatures are immune. It’s up to the PCs to decide
whether it’s safer to fight an elite paragon medusa blindfolded or to risk its
gaze.</p>

<p>MV gazes are triggered actions, which means the monster doesn’t need to choose
between using its weapons or its gaze in a turn. Also, blinding yourself won’t
save you from these gazes.</p>

<h3 id="medusa-archer-mm">Medusa Archer (MM)</h3>

<p>This lady is has the closest stat block to the classic medusas of editions
past. She’s a Level 10 Elite Controller with 212 HP. Her speed is 7 and her
poison resistance 10.</p>

<p>She fights in melee with her <strong>Snaky Hair</strong>, which does a bit of physical damage
plus 10 ongoing poison damage, and also inflicts a -2 penalty to Fortitude (save
ends both). Her main ranged attack is a <strong>Longbow</strong> (range 20/40 vs AC) whose
poison-dipped arrows trigger a secondary attack against Fortitude on a hit,
causing the same rider effects as the hair.</p>

<p>The archer’s <strong>Petrifying Gaze</strong> is a Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude. It slows on a
hit, and this worsens to immobilized on the first failed save and to full
petrification on the second. The first two conditions are (save ends), but
petrification is permanent until cured. This is an <em>at-will</em> power, and the
perfect thing to use on people already weakened by the poison from the other
attacks.</p>

<h3 id="medusa-bodyguard-mv">Medusa Bodyguard (MV)</h3>

<p>One of those poor oppressed MV males, this guy is a Level 12 Soldier with 123
HP. He is <em>not</em> immune to petrification and has Resist 10 Poison and Speed 6.</p>

<p>The bodyguard is armed with a <strong>broadsword</strong> and a <strong>longbow</strong>. The longsword
marks for a turn on a hit, and both attacks have an ongoing 5 poison damage
(save ends) rider. The bodyguard’s <strong>Mind-Venom Gaze</strong> triggers as an interrupt
when a marked target ignores the mark. It’s a Close Blast 5 vs. Will that must
include the triggering character. It does a good bit of poison damage to those
it hits, and also stuns the triggering character if it hits them. The gaze
recharges whenever the bodyguard hits with his sword, and blind creatures are
<em>not</em> immune.</p>

<h3 id="medusa-venom-arrow-mv">Medusa Venom Arrow (MV)</h3>

<p>Venom arrows are non-elite versions of the MM Archers, being level 12 artillery
monsters with 96 HP.</p>

<p>Like Archers, they fight in melee with their less-whimsically named <strong>serpent
hair</strong>, which deals poison damage and inflicts a -2 to Fortitude for a
turn. Their Range 30 <strong>bows</strong> do physical damage, ongoing 5 poison damage, and slow
(save ends).</p>

<p>Their <strong>Petrifying Stare</strong> is a triggered opportunity action. If an enemy starts
they turn within 2 squares of the medusa, they’re subject to a gaze that hits
<em>automatically</em> and slows them (save ends). This progresses to full
permanent petrification just like the Archer’s gaze.</p>

<p>The possible cures for this petrification are specified here: the right power or
ritual, a willing kiss from the medusa, or the afore-mentioned blood drops.</p>

<h3 id="medusa-warrior-mm">Medusa Warrior (MM)</h3>

<p>We’re back in elite territory with these dudes, who are Level 13 Elite Soldiers
with 272 HP. They fight with <strong>longswords</strong> and <strong>longbows</strong> as well.</p>

<p>The longsword attacks trigger a secondary attack against Fortitude on a hit,
dealing ongoing 10 poison damage and slowing (save ends both). The arrows
automatically inflict the ongoing damage if they hit (save ends).</p>

<p>As elites, warriors can use a standard action to make two sword attacks, and
those deal extra damage against a dazed target. Their source of daze effects is
their <strong>Venomous Gaze</strong> (Close Blast 5 vs. Will), which does poison and psychic
damage, with “daze” and “weaken” riders (save ends both).</p>

<p>Warriors prefer melee, alternating between their gaze and their double sword
attacks. If you have more than one, they’ll coordinate their actions to that
effect as well.</p>

<h3 id="medusa-spirit-charmer-mv">Medusa Spirit Charmer (MV)</h3>

<p>The lady medusa from the MV. She’s a Level 13 Controller with 130 HP, immunity
to petrification and resist poison 10. This is more of a spellcaster or psion
type.</p>

<p>Like the MM archer, she uses her <strong>serpent hair</strong> to fight in melee, doing
poison damage on a hit and inflicting a -2 penalty to saves for a turn. Her main
ranged attack is <strong>Spirit Charm</strong> (Close Blast 5 vs. Will), which does a bit of
psychic damage and compels the target to approach the medusa. This isn’t a pull,
but a choice: the victim must either end their next turn within 2 squares of the
medusa, or it must take further psychic damage.</p>

<p>Once per encounter she can cast <strong>Swords to Snakes</strong> (Area Burst 1 Within 10
vs. Will), an illusion that makes people think their weapons and tools have
become snakes. This prevents them from using weapon or implement powers (save
ends).</p>

<p>The spirit charmer’s Signature Medusa Move is the <strong>Stony Glare</strong>, a reaction
that triggers if an enemy ends their movement within 2 squares of the
medusa. Which by the way can happen due to Spirit Charm! This is a Close Blast 2
that only affects the triggering enemy, targets Fortitude, and petrifies
<em>immediately</em>. This is a (save ends) condition until the third failed save, in
which it becomes permanent until cured.</p>

<p>The possible cures are the same as those of the Venom Arrow’s gaze.</p>

<h3 id="medusa-shroud-of-zehir-mm">Medusa Shroud of Zehir (MM)</h3>

<p>A powerful Zehir-worshipping avenger or assassin. This lady is a Level 18
Skirmisher with 172 HP. She is immune to petrification and has 10 resistance to
both acid and poison.</p>

<p>The Shroud fights with paired <strong>short swords</strong>, which do physical damage and
ongoing acid and poison damage (save ends). She will often use a maneuver named
<strong>Fangs of Death</strong> (recharge 4-6) which allows her to make two sword attacks and
shift 3 squares between them. There’s a typo in her attack bonus, which is
listed as +15 instead of the correct +23.</p>

<p>Her <strong>Snaky Hair</strong> is a minor action, with the right attack bonus and the same
damage as a sword blow. It inflicts the same ongoing damage and a further -2
penalty to Fortitude (save ends both).</p>

<p>The <strong>Petrifying Gaze</strong> is here and works the same as the archer’s.</p>

<p>Shrouds spam those snake bites and use Fangs of Death whenever it’s
charged, since it spreads the poison around and allows them more mobility. When
it’s not charged, they use their gazes.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There are a few on the MM.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11: 1 medusa archer, 1 venom-eye basilisk, and a gaggle of snaketongue
cultists.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: 1 medusa warrior, a bunch of grimlocks and 2 gargoyles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 2 shrouds of Zehir, 1 yuan-ti malison disciple of Zehir, and 3
yuan-ti abominations.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, medusas are probably the world’s premier basilisk owners, since
they are completely immune to that monster’s gazes and they complement their own
powers nicely. I imagine even good medusas subscribe to newsletters on the care
and feeding of basilisks.</p>

<p>They also tend to associate with or employ other monsters who are similarly
immune to their powers, like the blind grimlocks or gargoyles and other
earth-elemental creatures. Also, if you feel like yuan-ti alone don’t give you
enough options to stock a dungeon full of snake-people, you can add some medusas
in. If you believe those MV myths, medusas are instinctively compelled to serve
yuan-ti, probably the only instance where they would put themselves in the
“servant” position.</p>

<p>Personally I like the image of the “archer medusa” a lot, and as with most other
humanoids I’d probably include non-villainous medusa in my setting to go along
with the usual antagonists. The stat blocks from both books seem to imply their
gazes attacks are always entirely voluntary, which would mean a peaceful medusa
wouldn’t even need those veils or dark goggles. Guess they might still wear them
as a sign of goodwill, though, like sometimes knights will peace-bond their
swords to show they mean no harm.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>My first contact with Maruts was in Third Edition, where they were a type of
Inevitable, a Lawful Neutral outsider. It could be that they predate that
edition (though AD&amp;D was all about modrons instead). Here, they appear only on
the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In Fourth Edition, Maruts are enigmatic natives of the Astral Sea, usually found
wandering that plane and others as mercenaries for hire. As mercenaries, they
probably don’t care much about who their bosses are, as long as those bosses
stick to their end of the contract. If they don’t, I imagine retribution
is… inevitable.</p>

<p>The price for a Marut’s service is always a reciprocal service, to be specified
at a later date. They keep an exacting record of these favors in their astral
fortresses. No one knows why they’re gathering favors in this manner.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two Marut stat blocks here, both epic. They have some common traits:
trained Perception, Truesight, a land speed of 8, plus flight and teleport
speeds of 4. They’re also immune to sleep, have Resist 10 Thunder, and an
amazing Regeneration of 20 with no weaknesses that temporarily shut it
down. These things are really hard to kill and really hard to get away from.</p>

<p>Maruts are Unaligned, being indifferent to the cosmic struggle between good and
evil. All they care about is keeping their ledgers balanced.</p>

<h3 id="marut-blademaster">Marut Blademaster</h3>

<p>This Medium Immortal Humanoid is a Level 21 Soldier with 201 HP and all common
marut traits. It wields a greatsword in combat.</p>

<p>That <strong>greatsword</strong> is its only attack, doing a mix of physical and thunder
damage. A hit also pushes the target 1 square and marks them for a turn.</p>

<p>The damage of that basic attack is a bit underwhelming due to the early math,
but the blademaster will often (recharge 4-6) be able to make two such attacks a
round, making it considerably more dangerous.</p>

<p>You probably want to use enough of these to form a battle line. It’s hard to
stand your ground against a wall of marut blademasters, and it gets even harder
when they have backup.</p>

<h3 id="marut-concordant">Marut Concordant</h3>

<p>This Large Immortal Humanoid is a Level 22 Elite Controller with 418 HP and all
common marut traits. Concordants fight with their fists and with decrees backed
by mystical power.</p>

<p>You’ll likely see them coming at you from behind a battle line of
blademasters. They’ll bombard your position with <strong>Fortune’s Chains</strong> (Area
Burst 5 Within 20 vs. Will; enemies only; recharge 4-6), likely catching the
whole party and doing psychic damage with a daze rider (save ends).</p>

<p>Then they’ll stop melee PCs on their tracks with <strong>Dictums</strong> (minor action;
Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude), which do no damage but immobilize (save ends). When
the party finally manages to crash into the battle line, the concordants will
push them away again with a <strong>Thunderous Edict</strong> (Close Burst 5 vs. Fortitude;
enemies only; recharge 5-6) which does thunder damage and pushes 4 squares on a
hit.</p>

<p>If all of these powers happen to be recharging at the moment, they’ll content
themselves with reaching over the heads of the blademaster vanguard and punching
the PCs with Reach 2 <strong>slams</strong> that do a mix of physical and thunder damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s one level 23 sample encounter: 1 concordant, 2 blademasters, a war
devil, and 8 legion devils. There’s your battle line.</p>

<p>Fans of 3e inevitables are probably missing a lot of the lore that was removed
along with the Great Wheel cosmology. Personally, while I think 3e inevitables
were interesting, I also like the new lore. Enigmatic mercenaries stockpiling
favors for some future cosmic plan is an interesting background that leaves room
for GM creativity.</p>

through <a href="http://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-blog-addition-lich-van-winkle.html">Dungeon Fantastic</a>. Its author started role-playing with D&amp;D basic
back in 1981, stopped around the mid-90’s, and is now coming back to the hobby
after a 25-year hiatus.</p>

<p>I found some of the post titles there interesting enough, and the blog itself is
new enough, that I’m reading it from the beginning. The <a href="https://lichvanwinkle.blogspot.com/2020/02/back-to-table-top-roleplaying-games.html">first post</a> proves
that it’s going to be an interesting ride, because this is someone who played
back when the old school was new and who says that “there is a lot of
myth-making in the OSR”. Me, I started playing shortly before Mr. van Winkle
here stopped, but I think I’ll find plenty to agree with.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/06/28/shadowrun-irony.html">The Great Irony At the Heart of Shadowrun</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>For a very long time Shadowrun was my favorite game system and setting. These
days I still like the setting, but my annoyance at a host of small details in it
is stronger than my wish to play in it as written. Still, it’s useful to think
and talk about these details. It allows me to figure out what I want to do
better in my eventual home-brewed rewrite.</p>

<p>One of these details isn’t small at all, however. In fact, I’d go as far as
calling it the great irony at the heart of the game, as the title of this post
implied. It was developed from some forum posts I made on RPG.net.</p>

<h2 id="but-first-the-good-parts">But First, The Good Parts</h2>

<p>I don’t want to be unfairly critical of Shadowrun<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I know a few people who
write for it, and the last thing I want is to give the impression that I’m
attacking them. I’m not. This entire article is my personal opinion and in no
way meant to disparage any of the fine people who are passionate enough about
Shadowrun to write for it professionally. So let’s begin by talking about
something that this game does <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>One of the best things about the setting design of Shadowrun is that it presents
players with a very clear mission-based structure. The infamous question of “But
what do we <em>do</em> in this world?” is answered very early and very clearly. This is
a game about completing dangerous missions for money, just like D&amp;D is about
killing monsters and looting dungeons. Someone asks you to play Shadowrun, 99
times out of 100 you know the rough overall shape that campaign is going to
take. You see a heist movie and you start thinking about it in the context of
Shadowrun in your head, even if it doesn’t have all the same style elements,
because the premise is strong.</p>

<p>Shadowrun nailed the answer to this important question so well that it kinda
spilled over to other similar games. It became the default playstile for
Cyberpunk 2020 against the wishes of its own authors, and it often gets adopted
as the answer to “what do we do” in Transhuman Space<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which is so adamant
about offering none in its pages.</p>

<p>Like a lot of Shadowrun setting elements, though, this structure has an
excellent <em>premise</em> but its implementation gives rise to a lot of unintentional
oddness. Or, in this case, to a Great Irony.</p>

<p>This irony, I think, emerges when the strong premise above gets combined with
AD&amp;D-style adversarial GMing, which was very popular when Shadowrun was first
written. I believe it to be entirely unintentional, since as far as I can tell
Shadowrun’s design methodology was mostly based on the Rule of Cool with a dash
of “everyone else does this”. If it’s intentional, though, it’s among the
greatest acts of trolling in all of gaming.</p>

<h2 id="isnt-it-ironic">Isn’t it Ironic?</h2>

<p>Okay, so the Sixth World is ruled by megacorporations who control every aspect
of people’s lives. Most of these people live hand-to-mouth and work themselves
to death in order to prop up the decadent lifestyles of a few billionaire
executives. “Wage slave” is pretty much a synonym for “low-level megacorporate
employee” in this setting.</p>

<p>But as the flavor text tells us, player characters are supposed to have managed
to escape this cycle of misery. They live in the shadows cast by those giant
corporate towers, and they have the skills to oppose the megacorps and make
their independent way in the world.</p>

<p><em>Or do they?</em></p>

<p>I’ll admit I don’t know how things are structured in the most recent
editions<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, but I remember that the Shadowrun Companion for Second Edition
contained detailed advice on how much money your PCs should be paid for those
risky missions.  I call it the “rent plus change” model.</p>

<p>According to the book, GMs should pay PCs enough for them to cover their
lifestyle payments (i.e, rent and food) for the next month, with a little bit
left over for resupplying consumables and eventually upgrading a piece of gear
after a while. This was <em>per month</em>, not per run. If you had only one big run
that month, it would pay this amount. If you had several, they would pay
proportionally less so you’d receive the same “rent plus change” amount.</p>

<p>This was perfectly in-keeping with the AD&amp;D school of GMing and design, which
demanded PCs “earn” their power and had cool gear that cost money as a
significant part of that power. If they earn “too much” money, they would get
“too powerful”, and no one wants that! If your players look like they do, it’s
because they’re cheating cheaters who cheat and should be punished for it.</p>

<p>Almost all published adventures started with a scene where the party met with
Mr. Johnson to discuss the job. In the vast majority of these adventures,
Mr. Johnson is a shady corporate exec working for one of the megas. And the GM
text for this scene always included the oh-so-funny “If the players refuse the
job, announce that the adventure ended, pack up your things and go home.” This
is a joke about how the PCs don’t have any choice but to take the job as
presented. In fact, the flavor text for the same scene almost always assumes
they’re hurting for cash just before they get that call from their contact
setting up the meeting.</p>

<p>So yeah, those fiercely independent PC shadowrunners? <strong><em>They’re all wage slaves
too</em></strong>. And the game advises the GM to keep them that way.</p>

<p>Were the original writers oblivious to these implications, or are they still
laughing today about how no one seems to have noticed? I don’t think I have seen
any official discussion about this contradiction in any of the books I’ve
read. It’s just taken as a given, and never questioned.</p>

<p>This central irony gets funnier when you add in two sets of rules that were
published in the same edition.</p>

<h3 id="orichalcum">Orichalcum</h3>

<p>An early SR2 sourcebook called The Grimoire contained rules for making magic
items. It required a lot of skill tests and time, and the materials were still
super-expensive, but the final monetary cost was cheaper than buying the item.</p>

<p>“Do you buy or make your items?” would have been mostly a question of personal
preference… if the book didn’t also have rules for making those materials from
raw natural resources. You could use them for enchanting or sell them for half
list price. You could even make orichalcum, the magical metal used in the
creation of the most powerful magic items.</p>

<p>Orichalcum was so expensive that a single 10-gram “unit” cost the same as a
sports car or as almost nine months of High Lifestyle. The process for making it
was time consuming and laborious, but not really dangerous or illegal. And a
skilled character could end up with multiple units of orichalcum at the end of
that process. Selling even a single unit would more than pay the cost of the
necessary equipment, which was reusable.</p>

<p>With these rules, a team of PCs that includes at least one magician has no
financial reason to run the shadows. They can just set up an orichalcum-making
operation instead, and live like kings.</p>

<h3 id="stolen-cars">Stolen Cars</h3>

<p>The Shadowrun Companion sourcebook includes rules for stealing cars and selling
them on the black market, which theoretically were meant to be used in a
campaign where the characters were gangers instead of Shadowrunners. You could
sell an entire stolen car for a fraction of its market value, or break it down
for parts and sell those over several days and get money equal to the car’s full
list price.</p>

<p>Stealing cars is of course illegal and dangerous, but it was trivial for the
typical PC party in this game. After all they have the skills to routinely break
into top-secret research labs full of intricate and deadly security measures.</p>

<p>The cheapest four-wheeled vehicle in the book was the Ford Americar, your
typical “generic crummy sedan” that filled every street. Stealing and
dismantling one of those every week would pay roughly five times the amount
recommended in the “rent plus change” advice in <em>the very same book</em>. Or perhaps
you could steal one limousine or fancy sports car per quarter. In either case,
it was again much safer and more profitable than running the shadows.</p>

<h2 id="shadowrun--irony--awesome">Shadowrun + Irony = Awesome</h2>

<p>When these two “oopsies” were first discovered, I remember seeing a lot of GMs
go absolutely ballistic over them. The accusations of “munchkinism” flew thick
and fast, but in true those GMs were mad that the PCs were doing something that
wasn’t in the script. They reveled in describing the disproportionate response
law enforcement or competitors would visit upon the PCs, which was just an
excuse to punish the players for veering off the rails.</p>

<p>Personally, I think these two altertane activities are fraggin’ awesome,
precisely because they allow the party to truly break free from the grind. If
your players decide to retire from shadowrunning and make orichalcum or boost
cars for a living, I fully believe that the right response is to play along and
make the campaign be about that! All of those things mentioned as hard blocks by
curmudgeonly controlling GMs are actually excellent adventure hooks. And I’m
pretty sure any decent player group is going to keep finding non-monetary
reasons to return to the shadows. There’s still people to help and megacorps to
destroy, after all.</p>

<p>So I say that the first thing a team of shadowrunners needs to do is to find a
way to leave classic shadowrunning behind for good. It’s a sucker’s game. Stay
independent, take care of your community, tear down the system, make the Sixth
World better.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Manticores are based on Persian myth, and have been in D&amp;D at least since the
days of BECMI. Here they are present in both the Monster Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Manticores are monsters with the body of a very large lion, bat-like wings, and
a vaguely humanlike face. Their tails are long, whip-like, and tipped with iron
spikes.</p>

<p>These creatures are sapient, but deeply stupid and even more deeply <em>mean</em>,
living up to their Chaotic Evil alignment. They claim large hunting territories
around their lairs and are known to extend them even further on a whim. Like,
say, when they discover a tasty village just on the other side of the current
borders. They specifically seek out sapient prey if at all possible. Their
favorites are humans and dwarves.</p>

<p>Tough technically capable of parley, manticores rarely bother listening. Those
who manage to get through to a manticore can sometimes appease them with bribes
of food, a tactic also used by smarter villains who want to hire some manticore
muscle. There’s absolutely no guarantee the manticore will show up for the job,
or stay appeased. Even manticores trained since they were cubs have a tendency
to turn on their handlers. Should the beast actually hold its end of the
bargain, it might end up serving as a mount for the villain commanding it.</p>

<p>Manticores have three rows of teeth that work a bit like a shark’s, often
falling off and being replaced by new ones. Loose teeth and spikes, often stuck
in mangled corpses, are a sure sign that you’re in manticore country. Despite
having all those teeth, they prefer to use their claws in combat.</p>

<p>Heraldry has them as symbols of unpredictable danger, viciousness and
cruelty. Manticore iconography is used in danger signs such as those meant to
keep people away from an unstable abandoned mine or the like. They’re also
adopted as symbols by groups such as evil mercenaries or bandits who want to
seem all edgy and badass.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual only has one manticore stat block, but the Vault has <em>four</em>,
each with a different role. That’s enough for you to make an all-manticore
encounter. They’re Large Natural Magical Beasts.</p>

<p>Manticores run at speed 6 and fly at speed 8. Their keen senses give them
trained Perception, and all of them can shoot those spikes from their
tails. They don’t run out of ammunition either. Perhaps the spikes magically
grow as soon as they’re fired, or perhaps there are so many to begin with they
have Enough(TM) for any given fight.</p>

<h3 id="manticore-mm">Manticore (MM)</h3>

<p>The classic model is a Level 10 Elite Skirmisher with 210 HP and the Mount
keyword.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a claw, and it can launch spikes out to Range 10. The spike
attack allows them to shift 3 squares either before or after firing. <strong>Manticore
Fury</strong> is a standard action that allows the beast to make both a claw and a
spike attack in any order. Every so often (recharge 3-6) the manticore can whip
its tail really hard and fire a <strong>Spike Volley</strong> (Area Burst 1 within 10).</p>

<p>Its mount ability is <strong>Guided Sniper</strong>, representing the fact that it allows its
rider to act as a spotter. This gives both the basic spike throw and Spike
Volley a +2 bonus to hit.</p>

<p>I’m tempted to plop a cheeky goblin atop a manticore, but realistically the
rider would be someone more badass - otherwise they’d just get eaten instead.</p>

<h3 id="manticore-striker-mv">Manticore Striker (MV)</h3>

<p>Essentially a regular version of the MM elite manticore, this one is a Level 10
Skirmisher with 106 HP. None of the MV manticores have the Mount keyword or
abilities.</p>

<p>The striker can shift 2 squares either before or after its <strong>claw</strong> and <strong>tail
spike</strong> attacks, and lacks the ability to make both in the same round. If
someone hits it, though, it can make a <strong>spike counterattack</strong> as a reaction,
shooting a tail spike at the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>

<h3 id="manticoer-impaler-mv">Manticoer Impaler (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 11 Brute has 138 HP. Its <strong>claw</strong> and <strong>tail spike</strong> attacks do
Brute-level damage, and it also has a <strong>Tail Lance</strong> (melee 2 vs. AC) that can
grab a target by impaling it.</p>

<p>The escape DC on the grab is 19, and while grabbed the target takes ongoing
physical damage. While it has a creature impaled, the manticore’s flight gains
an altitude limit of 6 squares.</p>

<p>While it’s grabbing someone, the manticore can also use <strong>Prepare to Drop</strong>, a
move action that allows it to fly its speed and pull the target along. This
includes pulling them straight up! It’s not stated in the stat block, but I
think the manticore can choose to release someone it’s grabbing on its
turn. Damage from the drop uses standard falling rules (1d10 per 2 squares/10ft,
IIRC).</p>

<h3 id="manticore-spike-hurler-mv">Manticore Spike Hurler (MV)</h3>

<p>As you might have guessed from the name, this is the Artillery manticore. It’s
Level 13 with 100 HP.</p>

<p>It has the usual <strong>claw</strong> and <strong>tail spike</strong> attacks, with the spike being more
accurate and doing more damage. It can also launch a <strong>spike volley</strong> (area
burst 1 within 10) at will.</p>

<h3 id="manticore-sky-hunter">Manticore Sky Hunter</h3>

<p>This one is a Level 13 Soldier (Leader) with 130 HP, and it’s remarkable for
being a manticore that cares about its allies. It has a <strong>Shielding Wings</strong> aura
1 that grants allies inside a +2 bonus to AC and Reflexes.</p>

<p>Its basic attacks are the usual <strong>claw</strong> and <strong>tail spike</strong>, with the claws also
marking for a turn on a hit. As a minor action it can also let out a
<strong>Threatening Roar</strong> that automatically marks everyone in a Close Burst 1 for a
turn.</p>

<p>If any marked enemy within 5 squares makes an attack that doesn’t include the
sky hunter, it can use a tail spike attack on them as a reaction (<strong>Defender’s
Spike</strong>).</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The MM has two encounters featuring its elite manticore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11: 1 manticore, 1 galeb duhr rockcaller, 4 ogre savages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 2 manticores, 2 hill giants, 4 ogre thugs (minions).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the first one I think the manticore is serving as the galeb duhr’s mount,
having finally come across someone it can’t eat. While it’s funny to imagine the
hill giants trying to hide the manticores in the second encounter, I don’t think
that would work out very well for them.</p>

<p>I like manticores, they’re fun to run and fun to fight. The four MV stat blocks
give us a bit more variety in tactics while staying true to the core MM
concept. Perhaps you could take a pair of those and make them into Huge Elites
so that those giants can finally make their dreams of flying come true.</p>
