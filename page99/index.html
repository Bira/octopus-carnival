<p>Sakura was built centuries ago, by the despotic empire that ruled this region in
ancient times. She was a bodyguard to one of their high officials, but
eventually rebelled when she saw how much suffering the empire inflicted on its
population.</p>

<p>The warforged joined in the slave revolt that finally toppled the empire, and
fell in battle there. She was recently found and re-activated by a group of
delvers, and joined up with them to find out more about her strange new
surroundings - and to find a way to repair the extensive battle damage she still
bears.</p>

<p>Even though Sakura wasn’t conscious for all of those centuries of inactivity,
she still feels a terrible sense of loneliness, and prefers to stick close to
her newfound friends to keep that feeling away.</p>

<p>Mechanically, Sakura uses the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/17/dfrpg-warforged.html">Warforged</a> racial template and the Duelist
template from the “Swords Against Evil” article Pyramid #3/64. It’s a variant
Swashbuckler, so she is allowed to buy Swashbuckler power-ups with earned
points. Equipment is from the DFRPG boxed set.</p>

<p>Sakura is very well-positioned to benefit from the Martial Artist “multiclass”
lens from GURPS DF 3: The Next Level, though I can see her going towards Knight
or Holy Warrior instead. Other destinations from earned points include buying
off Wounded to represent fixing her battle damage, and of course more combat
abilities.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! You can find all of them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Both the Monster Manual and the Vault call them Cyclopses in the plural, but I’m
going to use Cyclopes and there’s nothing you can do about it.</p>

<p>Cyclopes are drawn from Greek myth. The most famous individual there is
Polyphemus, who tangles with Odysseus during his travels, but many others appear
in other myths, where they are often regarded as proficient craftsmen. Depending
on the story, these giants are either brothers to the Titans or demigods.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>All that stuff above is Greek myth, though. D&amp;D cyclopes don’t have divine
blood, and in 4e they get a whole new backstory.</p>

<p>Here, they’re Large Fey Humanoids native to the Feywild. Some theorize they’re
an “echo” of the world’s ogres, but if this is true they’re the platonic ideal
of their mundane counterparts in the same way the other fey monsters we saw
before are. These giants have robust builds, grey or light purple skin and
heavily ridged brows in addition to the infamous single large eye in the middle
of their foreheads.</p>

<p>Cyclops culture centers around loyalty and service. Once a cyclops has sworn
fealty to a lord, they will obey all of the lord’s orders regardless of how they
might feel about them. Only if their lord betrays them will they forsake this
service. The main reason PCs might come into conflict with cyclopes is because
the vast majority of them collectively sworn to serve the fomorians, the <em>other</em>
fey giants we’ll get to eventually. For now it suffices to say fomorians are bad
news all around. Fomorian magic is probably the reason why modern cyclopes are
one-eyed and sometimes have gaze attacks.</p>

<p>This swearing of allegiance happened at the dawn of time, and by now “cyclopes
serve fomorians” is a truism akin to “water is wet”. Should someone (like, say,
a group of PCs) ever convince the cyclopes to abandon their masters, it will
shake the pillars of the Feywild.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, cyclopes can also sometimes be found in cahoots with
drow. Rumor has it that this is due to an ancient treaty between fomorians and
drow called the “Declaration of Eschatos”, though no one knows its specifics.</p>

<p>Cyclopes also have a reputation for being master crafters that spans the
planes. They prefer to spend lots of time and effort perfecting a single
creation to doing any sort of mass production, so items of cyclops make are sure
to be both rare and powerful.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>In addition to the staggering amount of lore above, both books provide us with a
very large variery of cyclopes to work with. Enough that you could likely stock
a whole dungeon with only cyclopes and their fomorian masters.</p>

<h3 id="common-cyclops-traits">Common Cyclops Traits</h3>

<p>All cyclopes here are Large Fey Humanoids, Unaligned, and have Int scores
between 10 and 14 (with the spellcasters getting the higher numbers). They’re
all trained in Perception and have Truesight, means they can see invisible
creatures and objects. In the MM versions, the range of their truesight is
limited to 6 squares; in the MV, it has the same range as their sight. They run
with speed 8.</p>

<p>They also all have an Evil Eye ability that’s usually an at-will minor action,
though the effects vary with the specific type of cyclops. Lets look at them
individually.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-guard">Cyclops Guard</h3>

<p>This is a Level 14 Minion Brute, present in both books. The MV version is the
only cyclops to not have Truesight - the MM version has Truesight 6 like the
others in the same book.</p>

<p>Being minions, they’re rather simple: they have a battleaxe attack, and their
evil eye is a triggered action that allows them to make a basic attack against
someone who misses them in melee.</p>

<p>The MM also has the Cyclops Warrior, which is identical aside from being
level 16. A bit of a waste of page space, since leveling up monsters is so easy
in 4e.</p>

<p>Both minions wear hide armor, and carry battleaxes and shields.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-crusher">Cyclops Crusher</h3>

<p>A Level 14 Brute with 171 HP present only in the MV. It wears scale and attacks
with a spiked greatclub, and has a Tremor Smash that recharges on a 5-6, targets
everyone in a close blast 2, and does a lot of damage and knocks prone on a hit.</p>

<p>Its evil eye automatically gives a target a -2 penalty to all attacks and
defenses until the cyclops uses the power again or until the end of the
encounter, whichever comes first.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-impaler">Cyclops Impaler</h3>

<p>Level 14 Artillery with 111 HP, present only in the MM. It wears leather and
carries a sheaf of 12 spears on its back. The impaler attacks with those spears
both in melee and at range, and has a Spear Volley power that recharges on a 6
and allows it to make 2 more damaging spear attacks that also do ongoing damage.</p>

<p>Its evil eye gives it +2 to ranged attacks against the currently cursed
target. This is less effective than it seems because its basic spear toss
doesn’t have the usual accuracy bonus for artillery monsters, meaning the evil
eye only brings it up to par. When fixing this for use at the table, you should
give it the usual accuracy bonus to all ranged attacks and let the evil eye
apply on top of that.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-rambler">Cyclops Rambler</h3>

<p>The Level 14 Skirmisher variant with 141 HP, present in both books. The rambler
wears mail and wields a greatsword.</p>

<p>Its evil eye allows it to designate a target, and when adjacent to that target
the rambler can shift one extra square. When it hits the target with an attack,
it can use Feywild Alacrity (recharge 6) to immediately gain a free move.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual version has a Mocking Eye aura 10, that gives all enemies
inside a -5 penalty to target the rambler with opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault version trades this for Bounding Charge, an encounter power
that does high damage, half in a miss, and allows the rambler to shift up to 3
squares both before and after the attack.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-hewer">Cyclops Hewer</h3>

<p>The Level 16 Soldier version, with 158 HP, from both books. It wears mail and
fights with a battleaxe and a light shield. The main attraction here is the evil
eye ability: if its target attacks anyone other than the hewer, it gets to make
a free attack against them. And if the target moves away from the hewer, it can
immediately shift 1 square closer to it.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-battleweaver">Cyclops Battleweaver</h3>

<p>A Level 16 Skirmisher with 165 HP, present only in the monster manual. This one
wears mail and wields a glaive. Its evil eye reduces the target’s speed by 2,
and it can sweep with the glaive at will in a close burst 2 that pushes anyone
it hits 1 square and knocks them prone in addition to doing the same damage as a
basic attack.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, when the battleweaver suffers a “save ends” effect, it can
immediately transfer that effect to the current target of its evil eye, which is
a nice bit of unexpected nastiness.</p>

<h3 id="cyclops-storm-shaman">Cyclops Storm Shaman</h3>

<p>Level 17 Artillery with 128 HP, from the MM only. The shaman wears leather and
carries a staff. Its basic staff attack does a mix of physical and thunder
damage; it has a basic ranged attack in the form of a Storm Orb that targets
Reflex and does lightning and thunder damage.</p>

<p>Its evil eye makes the target vulnerable (5) to both thunder and lightning
damage. This helps both its melee and ranged attacks, though a vulnerable target
hit by the Storm Orb will only take 5 extra damage and not 10, since the damage
type is “thunder and lightning”.</p>

<p>Once per encounter it can place a Storm Burst, an area 2 within 10
attack that creates a zone I imagine being a little angry storm cloud. Enemies
starting their turns in the zone are zapped for lightning damage, and the rain
automatically douses uncovered flames and ends ongoing fire damage.</p>

<p>Finally, as an encounter minor action, the storm shaman can gain a flight speed
of 8 for a turn. If it hasn’t landed when the flight ends, it will crash.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual suggests a whopping 4 encounters involving cyclopes. The most
common scenario is a fomorian accompanied by a cyclops security detail, but
there are some surprises here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: 4 cyclops guards, 2 drow warriors, 1 drow blademaster. The
Declaration of Eschatos in action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 2 cyclops battleweavers, 2 thunderfury boars, 1 fomorian warrior. I
can picture the cyclopes opening cage doors to release the <del>hounds</del> boars.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 1 cyclops storm shaman, 2 battleweavers and 1 chimera. Could these
be independent, or do the fomorians trust the shaman to go on away missions?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 2 cyclops hewers, 2 cyclops impalers, 1 fomorian painbringer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I really like the fey-tinged fluff for cyclops here, and their ties to
fomorians. It appears the authors have also managed to keep enough references to
the Greek myths to keep things flavorful (the cyclopes-as-master-crafters
thing).</p>

<p>Cyclopes feel to me like honorable and sympathetic foes the party will see
itself forced to fight in order to get at their evil masters. A fomorian-focused
adventure pretty much <em>has</em> to include a way for the party to turn the cyclopes
against the fomorians.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! You can find all of them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Crocodiles exist in real life and frequently feature in media such as nature
documentaries, so if you’re reading this you probably already know what they
look like. For a long time everyone thought crocodiles were the closest thing
you could get to dinosaurs in the modern day, then they discovered that honor
belonged to chickens.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault has stats for a “mundane” crocodile in its animal appendix,
and the Monster Manual has two fantastic varieties that are more likely to
attack adventurers.</p>

<h2 id="crocodile">Crocodile</h2>

<p>This is the one from the Monster Vault. Since it’s in the appendix and not in a
full entry, there’s no lore at all. The mundane crocodile is a Medium Natural
Beast (reptile), and a Level 3 Soldier with 46 HP. It has low-light vision, a
land speed of 4 and a swim speed of 8. It attacks with a bite that does damage
and grabs on a hit, and once it’s grabbed someone it can inflict automatic
damage on the victim as a standard action. Short and simple. The grab has an
escape DC of 13.</p>

<p>We’ll have to fall back to the standard cliches here: they live in lakes, rivers
and swamps and hunt by looking like floating logs until something small and
meaty gets within charge range. I imagine mundane crocs won’t go out of their
way to attack PCs, but might become violent if they feel threatened or are
protecting their young.</p>

<h2 id="visejaw-crocodile">Visejaw Crocodile</h2>

<p>The first fantastic variety from the Monster Manual. Its scales are grey and a
red streak menaces with leathery spikes on its back. The visejaw crocodile is a
Large Natural Beast (reptile), and a Level 4 Soldier with 58 HP. It has a ground
speed of 6 and a swim speed of 8, and its attacks are pretty almost identical to
those of the mundane crocodile.</p>

<p>This crocodile’s jaws don’t inflict automatic damage on grabbed targets, but
instead make an attack against Fortitude with half damage on a miss. Fixing the
damage bugs on this one would also involve dropping the attack roll and making
this damage automatic.</p>

<h2 id="feymire-crocodile">Feymire Crocodile</h2>

<p>The platonic ideal of a man-eating crocodile. This Huge Fey Beast (reptile) is
so good at looking like a log in a bog it actually has vegetation sprouting from
its back, and carries the swamp with it wherever it goes. It’s native to the
Feywild but also inhabits the world in places where the two planes
touch. Interestingly enough it seems to be able to sustain itself by putting
down roots, but it obviously prefers the tender meat of adventurers.</p>

<p>The feymire crocodile is a Level 10 Elite Soldier with 216 HP. That bit about it
carrying the swamp with it is not an exaggeration! It has a Feymire aura that
makes the ground in a 2-square radius from itself difficult terrain for
enemies. It also has Regeneration 5, which can be temporarily shut down with
fire damage. Yes, it has the same staying power as a troll. It’s also nearly as
smart at Int 5, though being a Beast it’s not sapient as such.</p>

<p>Other traits include low-light vision and the expected swim speed of 8. It
attacks with stronger versions of the grabby bite and clamping jaws from the
other two crocs, and needs the same fix as the visejaw. In addition, if it grabs
a bloodied Medium or smaller creature, it can try to Swallow it. This is an
attack against Fortitude; if it hits, the target goes into the croc’s gullet,
becoming dazed, restrained, and taking ongoing 10 acid damage until free.</p>

<p>I used to think restrained meant you couldn’t take any actions, but a restrained
target can still make attacks at a -2 penalty. The Feymire Crocodile’s Swallow
ability places a further restriction: the swallowed victim may only make basic
attacks against the insides of the croc. Yes, you still have to beat its
defenses. Not much of a problem for the fighter or warlord, but nearly everyone
else is in trouble.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The suggested encounter in the Monster Manual is a party of lizardfolk and their
visejaw pet. I imagine the feymire crocodile would be the sort of animal to hang
out with trolls or bog hags.</p>

<p>The feymire croc is definitely my favorite of the lot. It gives me a nice
fairytale vibe.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! You can find all of them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most famous D&amp;D “monster ladders” is the one composed of golems:
humanoid constructs built to do the bidding of powerful spellcasters. They’re
generally inspired by mythology, with the name for the category being taken from
the legend of the Golem of Prague.</p>

<p>Due to the vagaries of alphabetical ordering, the first “golem” our reading of
the Monster Manual hits is the one standing on the very top rung of that ladder:
the Colossus.</p>

<p>Obviously inspired by the Colossus of Rhodes, who was said to animate when its
city was threatened by invasion, colossi are enormous animated statues, often
made in the image of a god or another mighty entity. Like their smaller
relatives, they exist to obey their creators. Of course, not just anyone can
create one of these babies - it requires an epic ritual most commonly known to
entities such as demon lords and divine exarchs.</p>

<p>The name of the single stat block given to us by the Monster Manual hammers the
point home: it presents us with the <strong>Godforged Colossus</strong>. There are no colossi
on the Monster Vault.</p>

<p>The Godforged Colossus is a Huge Immortal Animate (construct). That’s smaller
than I thought it would be, but then again so was the Colossus of
Rhodes. Constructs are not affected by effects that specifically target living
creatures. They also don’t sleep, breathe or eat, and are immune to disease and
poison.</p>

<p>This specific construct is a Level 29 Elite Brute with 662 HP. In addition to
the standard construct immunities listed on its stat block, it’s also immune to
fear and has Resist 30 to both psychic and force damage. It strides across the
land at speed 10. As a golem-adjacent creature, it’s Unaligned, doesn’t speak,
and has Int 4.</p>

<p>As its basic attack the Godforged Colossus wields a weapon made of pure
force. It does an amount of force damage that’s surprisingly close to that it
should be even without the math fix. A hit also triggers a relatively inaccurate
secondary attack against Will, doing another bit of psychic damage and stunning
the target for a turn on a hit. I feel this is a bit of unecessary complication;
to fix it, add the damage of the secondary attack into that of the primary and
make the whole lot “force and psychic”. I don’t think anyone who isn’t another
colossus resists those two simultaneously. You could leave the secondary attack
for the stun effect, or replace it with the push from the Defensive Strike
(below).</p>

<p>The monster’s other standard actions are as follows: it can attack at a range of
20 with a Force Missile, which targets Reflex, does force damage, and pushes 5
squares on a hit. Once per encounter it can unleash the Voice of the Demiurge,
which targets the Will of all enemies within a Close Burst 10 (!), doing
respectable psychic damage and stunning for a turn on a hit.</p>

<p>Finally, as a reaction whenever someone moves adjacent to it, it can use a
Defensive Strike that recharges on 5-6. On a hit it does all the damage of the
basic attack (some force, some psychic) and allows a secondary attack against
Fortitude that on a hit pushes the target 5 squares, knocks them prone, and
dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>No specific mention is made of the material used to build this colossus, though
judging by the resistances I’d say it’s actually made of pure force tinted with
the thoughts of the god who built it.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>The book says a colossus might be a city’s greatest guardian, the idol of a god
that animates to punish defilers, or a pair of great sculptures acting as
guardians of another creature’s lair.</p>

<p>The first one is our old buddy Rhodes; the second brings to mind that demon
statue from the cover of the 1e PHB; and the third is surely the sphinxes from
the Neverending Story. The last boss from Shadow of the Colossus (the Tower)
also fits here.</p>

<p>The first example encounter is level 28, a godforged colossus and 4 dragonborn
champions. Tiamat or Bahamut… or maybe both, with equal teams fighting each
other! Does the level 23 party dare to interfere?</p>

<p>The second is level 29, 1 colossus, 3 sorrowsworn reapers, and 2 shadowraven
swarms. Woe be unto those who trespass upon the fane of the Raven Queen.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m a fan of colossi, particularly of those whose shadow you can stand
under. They make me wish D&amp;D in general had more giant-climbing rules.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This is a bonus article in a series! You can find the rest of them <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">here</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of firearms is a bit thorny in D&amp;D and adjacent games. Some people
like the concept, others feel it doesn’t fit the “medieval” idiom for mechanical
or flavor reasons.</p>

<p>Pathfinder tries to address this by moving everything gun-related to its own
class: the Gunslinger, which came out in its <strong>Ultimate Combat</strong> supplement. The
presence or absence of that class in a campaign acts as a proxy for the presence
or absence of guns<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Dungeon Fantasy ended up going along a similar route - while it leaves guns out
of its equipment list entirely in <strong>DF1</strong> and <strong>DF: Adventurers</strong>, it ended up
publishing the Musketeer professional template in <strong>Pyramid #3/36</strong>, along with
a goodly amount of setting-appropriate guns.</p>

<p>With the material from that issue, we have what we need to stat up the star of
this post: Lirianne the Gunslinger! Here she is:</p>

<p>Like all of Wayne Reynold’s Iconics, this design is a bit busy, but I like the
tricorne hat. Looking at her bio <a href="https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Lirianne">here</a> and her stats <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9a64">here</a>, we can learn
the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lirianne comes from the city-state of Alkenstar in the Mana Wastes, a region
whose ambient magic takes the form of deadly storms that produce mutated
abominations. This hostile environment forced its people to innovate,
advancing their technology to the level where black-powder guns are common.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She was the middle child of three, their father a marshal and their mother an
elf who left while they were young (because for a Pathfinder elf, ten years
and three children is a “fling”). She spent much of her childhood devouring
pulpy tales of adventure and dreaming of starring her own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growing up to follow in her father’s footsteps, Lirianne got caught in a mana
storm and teleported thousands of miles north to the mostly-medieval continent
of Avistan - where all those pulpy tales took place. Now she travels as a
wandering do-gooder, in no particular hurry to return home.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lirianne wields two single-shot pistols, which she can load quite quickly due
to Pathfinder’s generous rules for such. Her class abilities allow her to
perform quite a few tricks with these guns.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The GURPS version below uses the Musketeer professional template and the guns
from <strong>Pyramid #3/36</strong>, plus some of the perks from <strong>GURPS Gun Fu</strong> referenced in
that article. Her armor is from <strong>DF: Adventurers</strong>. I’m also using the
Alternate Guns Specialties from <strong>Pyramid #3/65</strong>.</p>

<p>While her pistol’s base reload time is 20 seconds, she manages to get it down to
3 by using paper cartridges (which halve reload time) and by having 3 levels of
Quick-Reload (which cut that further by 75% to a minimum of 3). That’s the
fastest she can get by the book, but I wouldn’t be averse to allowing a fourth
level of Quick-Reload to reduce that time to 1 second, and have her follow the
same “quick-firing” rule bow Scouts follow.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could introduce more modern guns (like revolvers or lever
action rifles) that would allow for a higher rate of fire. Those would make for
some fine loot!</p>

  <figcaption>Fine loot indeed! (by Ekaterina Burmak)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>An <em>Expedition to the Barrier Peaks</em>-like mix of fantasy and ultra-tech would be
extra-awesome for her since the full Gunslinger advantage would allow her to
shoot sci-fi rayguns as well as she does black powder pistols.</p>

<p>Other highlights include Lirianne’s relatively high Acrobatics skill (good for
acrobatic dodges and daring movement), and the other perks which allow her to
shoot a gun in each hand without having to drop either for reloading or doing
almost anything else. She <em>is</em> a bit deficient in social skills, so that might
be something to shore up later with earned points. Other good destinations for
earned points are more Guns (Pistol) and Acrobatics, as well as gun perks and
the Behind the Back power-up.</p>
