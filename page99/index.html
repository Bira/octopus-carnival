<p>Broken Jar was abandoned at the gates of a far-off monastery when he was a baby,
and was raised by monks his whole life. This particular monastery sends its
initiates out as mendicants once their basic training is completed, with the
intent that they return humbler and wiser after a while.</p>

<p>So it was with Broken Jar, who gladly started his journey. He met many of his
fellow monks who were on their way back, having judged they saw enough of the
world. He himself never quite got to that point. He always looked to the next
hill and longed to see what lay beyond it. New places to see, new people to
meet, new villains to punch. And so Broken Jar kept wandering.</p>

<p>Truth be told, he’s not quite sure how he got here. This place is so different
from the lands of his childhood that he doesn’t think he could have gotten here
with just a few weeks of hiking. Is he even in the same continent? The same
world? Finding the answer to that is sure to be fun, and in the meantime there’s
so much more to see around here! This wanderer is in absolutely no rush to go
back home.</p>

<p>Broken Jar’s specialty is fighting unarmed, or with a staff. As he is now, his
damage falls short of what a Weapon Master Knight can manage, but he does have
plenty of interesting tricks to use and can do cutting damage with while unarmed
thanks to his claws. Earned points should likely go towards increased combat
skills and power-ups that add to his unarmed damage.</p>

<p>The catfolk racial template I used for him is more similar to the one I wrote up
for Elder Scrolls <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html">Khajit</a> than the one in DF: Adventurers, which is really
quite “busy” and burnened by typical “cat” psychological disadvantages that
don’t really fit this particular character.</p>

<p>Every time you kill a demon, its soul is sent screaming back to the Abyss, where
it will eventually reincarnate as a new demon. However, sometimes the process
goes wrong, and a bunch of demon souls bump into each other on the way to the
Abyss and fuse into a big clump. This katamari of evil can’t reincarnate
properly, and instead rises as an undead demon. And this is how immoliths are
made!</p>

<p>Immoliths look like pillars of fire topped by a demonic skull. Many different
skeletal limbs emerge from their flames, likely belonging to the original demons
that make it up. As undead demons, their hate of the living is double-plus-big,
and they’re as likely to be found alongside powerful undead like liches and
vampires as they are with other demons. They’re only statted up in the Monster
Manual.</p>

<p>Immoliths are Large Elemental Magical Beasts (demon, fire, undead), and Level 15
Controllers with 153 HP and defenses a point or two lower than what you’d
expect. Interestingly, they lack darkvision, but I imagine that’s not needed
when you’re walking bonfire.</p>

<p>Immoliths are immune to fire, disease and poison. They have Variable Resistance
15 (switchable once per encounter), and Radiant Vulnerability 10. The intense
heat emanating from their bodies works as an Aura 1 that deals 10 fire damage to
anyone starting their turns within it.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 4 claw that does both immediate and ongoing fire
damage. Instead of that they can use a Fiery Grab against Large or smaller
targets. This combines the claw attack with a grab that pulls the victim
adjacent to the immolith (and into its aura). The demon can grab up to five
creatures this way, and while they’re grabbed they lose any resistance they have
to fire. Did you think you were safe just because you were a tiefling, fire
genasi or fire sorcerer?</p>

<p>As a minor action, the immolith can inflict a Deathfire Curse on someone as a
Ranged 10 attack that targets Will. On a hit the target is slowed (save ends),
and after they save from that they’ll take ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Also as a minor action, though only once per round, it can restore 5 HP to all
undead in a Close Burst 5, including itself.</p>

<p>It’s not inconceivable that one of these could have the entire party grabbed and
taking ongoing fire damage from their aura. People who try to run would be
slowed by the Deathfire Curse, and likely by the immolith’s buddies.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 14: one immolith, 2 vrocks, 4 mezzodemons, and 6
horde ghouls. Since it appears both mezzodemons and vrocks have means to limit a
character’s mobility, my analysis above checks out.</p>

<p>Hezrou a relative rarity among demons in that they like to serve. Whether their
master is a stronger demon or a mortal summoner, they will happily obey orders
as long as they’re given opportunities to kill things.</p>

<p>Hezrou are Large Elemental Humanoids (demons). Their muscular frames are all
hunched over, they have the heads of toads, and their skins are eternally
covered in putrescent slime. In fact, judging from the illustration in the books
the very flesh of the hezrou is eternally rotting, exposing bone in places, even
though they’re not undead.</p>

<p>Hezrou exist in both books. We’ll take a look at them separately.</p>

<h2 id="hezrou-monster-manual">Hezrou (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>Monster Manual Hezrou are Level 22 Brutes with 225 HP, darkvision, and variable
resistance 20 that can be switched twice per encounter. Their noxious stench
manifests as an Aura 2 that gives all enemies inside it a -2 penalty to
attacks. If the demon is bloodied, enemies in the aura are also weakened
(ruptured internal pus pockets!). They run with Speed 6.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 slam, but they also have a slightly less
damaging Reach 2 bite and the ability to use both as a standard action, which
brings their damage in line with the expected for their level like we’ve seen
with other multi-attacking regular brutes. These demons also ignore difficult
terrain, seeming to phase through it despite being otherwise solid.</p>

<p>They’re trained in Stealth and quite agile, so they could end up being quite
sneaky… if you can’t smell them coming first.</p>

<p>The proposed encounter is level 22, two hezrou, a deathpriest hierophant, and 5
abyssal ghoul myrmidons. Servants of Orcus, basicaly, with the hierophant
calling the shots.</p>

<h2 id="hezrou-monster-vault">Hezrou (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The MV Hezrou shares many of the traits of its MM cousin, with a few important
differences. It’s slightly tougher at 254 HP, and a lot stinkier. Its stench
does 10 poison damage to enemies caught in the area instead of merely inflicting
a penalty, and this rises to 20 damage when the thing is bloodied.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is still a slam, which is entirely responsible for its baseline
damage now. The bite is still there as a Recharge 4-6 attack that does about 50%
more damage than the slam.</p>

<p>The MV Hezrou also loses its Stealth training.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Hezrou might not be the most badass demons around, but they sure have a lot of
character. “Stinky toad demon who is happy with its lot in life as a goon” is
enough to make it memorable in a whole plane of creatures that smoulder with
generic rage.</p>

<p>A Goristro is basically a bigger, furrier, and spikier version of the Bull Demon
from classic Doom. They’re described in the Monster Manual as “living siege
engines”, and as Baphomet’s favorite demon type. They’re not on the Monster
Vault.</p>

<p>Goristros are Huge Elemental Humanoids (demons), which means they have huge
guts. “Humanoid” is even kinda applicable if you ignore the digitigrade legs
ending in hooves. They have darkvision and variable resistance 20 switchable two
times per encounter. With Int 6, they behave pretty much in the stereotypical
demon fashion, being all about charging things until they’re paste.</p>

<p>A typical Goristro is a Level 19 Elite Brute with 450 HP. Its basic attack is a
Reach 3 Slam, of which it can make two per standard action. Its Goring Charges
do increased damage when compared to the basic slam, also pushing the target and
knocking them prone on a hit.</p>

<p>It other powers are immediate reactions. Goristro Stomp triggers whenever a
non-adjacent enemy moves adjacent to the demon and recharges on a 4-6. The name
at first made me think it was an area effect shockwave, but it’s actually a
single-target attack that does about 1.5 times as much damage as a basic slam!</p>

<p>When bloodied, the demon gains access to Raging Frenzy, its other reaction
power. Whenever someone attacks it in melee, it makes a basic attack against
that enemy.</p>

<p>So goristros charge anything they want to destroy, and keep distributing slams
and stomps while ignoring their own safety. Since they want to destroy
everything and everyone, they’re never not charging and slamming. Rip and tear!</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 18 and has one goristro, two savage minotaurs and
3 abyssal ghouls. The ghouls are kind of Orcus’ thing, but the presence of the
minotaurs as the possible summoners would indicate this is a Baphomet operation.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>A goristro is a demon’s demon, which is to say it’s a near-mindless rage
machine. By themselves they’re kinda boring. You should place them alongside
whoemever summoned them, or alongside more interesting demons if the party is
taking the fight to the Abyss for some reason.</p>

<p>Fourth Edition demons are not at all fond of subtlety or complicated schemes,
but that doesn’t mean they’re <em>stupid</em>. I mean, it very often does, but not
always. Take the glabrezu, for example: it has Int 24, making it by far the
smartest demon we’ve yet seen. It’s present only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<p>Glabrezus are Huge Elemental Humanoids (demons), which might be yet another
example of mistyping because they’re less humanoid than evistros, and <em>those</em>
are magical beasts. They have digitigrade chicken legs, fanged goat heads with
no lips, hides that menace with spikes, and four arms: two humanoid and
human-sized ones growing out of their ribs, and two huge crab claws growing out
of the usual shoulder positions.</p>

<p>These physical features make it seem like they’d be pretty powerful physical
combatants, and well, they are. But they’re also some of demonkind’s premier
spellcasters. Their combat tactics aren’t what you’re expect of a wizard, since
they charge right into the fray instead of staying behind a line of guards.</p>

<p>Being smarter than the average demon, a glabrezu is partial to slightly more
complex strategies for spreading chaos and destruction. The book says it sows
discord among its own allies, and goads them to ever-greater acts of depravity
and violence. That doesn’t sound very different from what other demons do, so
I’m guessing the noteworthy thing here is that it will do this to whatever group
<em>summons</em> it.</p>

<p>Other demons would just resentfully growl at their binders and strain to break
free, but a glabrezu will act like he’s enjoying the opportunity to work with
such distinguished masters while spreading ugly rumors among their underlings
and posting fake news on Facebook. As long as it all ends in flames and tears,
they’ll have fun.</p>

<p>Mechanically, Glabrezus are Level 23 Elite Brutes with 520 HP. They’re trained
in Perception, Arcana, Bluff and Intimidate, and probably know quite a few
rituals for use out of combat. They have variable resistance 20, and can switch
it up 3 times per encounter. Their land and fly speed are both 8.</p>

<p>Being an epic-level MM1 monster, all of their attacks suffer heavily from the
damage bug and require fixing. The basic attack is a pincer claw that has Reach
3 (standard for a Huge monster). The demon can make two such attacks per turn,
and if both hit the same target they automatically grab it. No other powers
specifically target a grabbed victim, but the grab does ensure they’re always in
the area of effect for the demon’s spells. There’s three of them and they’re all
minor actions:</p>

<p>Abyssal Bolt is an at-will ranged attack with range 10, targeting Reflex and
doing untyped damage. It’s Plan B, basically: when the glabrezu is bloodied it
will retreat behind its minions and rain abyssal bolts down on the party.</p>

<p>Blasphemous Word is an encounter power that targets enemies in a close burst 5.
It attacks Will, does psychic damage, and dazes for a turn.</p>

<p>Word of Chaos is another selective Close Burst 5, but it recharges on a 6. It
targets Fortitude and does untyped damage that bypasses all resistances. That
last bit is unlikely to come up since very few things give characters resistance
to untyped damage, but it will be useful if the PCs do have access to those
things. And hey, it’s minor-action area damage!</p>

<p>When the Glabrezu is first bloodied, it will use Arcane Fury: this triggered
free action allows it to teleport up to 8 squares, recharge Blasphemous Word and
Word of Chaos, and use either one of them or an Abyssal Bolt immediately.</p>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 23: one glabrezu, 1 earthwind ravager elemental
and two blood fiends. So blood fiends <em>do</em> associate with demons! That’s another
strong argument for making them demon vampires again instead of abominations.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m going to be honest, I have trouble telling glabrezus, evistros and goristros
apart just from the names, but these demons are actually kinda cool. You don’t
always see a Brute spellcaster.</p>
