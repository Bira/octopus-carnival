<p>Driders are another classic D&amp;D monster, about as old as the drow they’re
thematically attached to. Mechanics-wise, these drow-spider beings still do
pretty much what you would expect them to, but their background has changed
significantly.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In past editions, driders were the result of a curse inflicted by Lolth on drow
that displeased her. Driders would he hated and shunned by other drow and would
either live in isolation or form communities of their own.</p>

<p>In 4e, driders are instead the result of a <em>blessing</em> bestowed by Lolth on drow
that <em>please</em> her. There’s a formal ritual named the Test of Lolth that turns
the worthy into driders (and kills the unworthy). Driders can often be found as
leaders or prestigious champions in drow communities!</p>

<p>I think this makes more sense than the old background, as driders were always
quite a bit more powerful than run-of-the-mill drow.</p>

<p>The MV splits the difference by adding that driders make their own caste in the
drow hierarchy, above most others but still subservient to the priestesses of
Lolth. Some of them resent this, and some grow to have more empathy towards
spiders than towards their fellow dark elves, so you can still meet the odd
drider hermit out in the wilds of the Underdark.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Driders usually retain all the abilities they had as drow, including their
racial powers, and add to this the increased movement speed, climbing, and
web-spinning abilities granted by their spider halves. They’re Large Fey
Humanoids with the Spider keyword, which means they count as spiders where
that’s important.</p>

<p>The <strong>Drider Fanglord</strong> is a Level 14 Brute with 172 HP, present in both
books. It has trained Perception and Darkvision, with the MM version
additionally being trained in Stealth and Dungeoneering. It scuttles at speed 8
and climbs at the same speed with Spider Climb.</p>

<p>This warrior wears leather in its drow half and fights with a greatsword. It can
also launch a web as a Ranged 5 attack targetting Reflex, which restrains the
target on a hit until they escape using the rules for escaping grabs. The DC for
this is quite a bit lower on the MV, which also specifies the target can
automatically escape by teleporting. The web recharges on a 4-6.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the fanglord can bite someone against whom it has combat
advantage, dealing a piddly 1d4 physical damage and a nice 10 ongoing poison
damage (save ends). It also has the Darkfire encounter power we saw in the Drow
entry.</p>

<p>The <strong>Drider Shadowspinner</strong> is a level 14 Skirmisher with 134 HP. It also wears
leather, and fights with a shortsword and magic. It has trained Perception,
Dungeoneering and Stealth, as well as darkvision. The shortsword does damage as
usual and allows slightly different skirmisher shenanigans in each book: in the
MM, the drider can shift 1 square before or after the attack; in the MV, it can
only shift on a hit, but that shift also ends any mark on it.</p>

<p>The shadowspinner’s ranged attack is a Slashing Darkness spell that has a range
of 5, targets Reflex, and does necrotic damage. It can also use the same Web as
the Fanglord.</p>

<p>The MM version has the Cloud of Darkness encounter power, which we saw in the
Drow entry. The MV version retains the cloud and also gains Darkfire.</p>

<p>As passive traits, the shadowspinner gains concealment from Shifting Shadows if
it ends the turn 3 or more squares away from its initial position, and it also
gains a sneak attack bonus against targets granting it CA.</p>

<p>Finally we have the plain old <strong>Drider</strong>, which only appears in the MV. This
Level 14 Soldier has 138 HP and Darkvision, but the stat block shows no trained
skills. It wields a scimitar and also wears leather.</p>

<p>The scimitar has Reach 2 (unlike the other weapons we saw), and the drider has
Threatening Reach with it. Scimitar attacks also mark targets for a turn on a
hit. Targets who ignore the mark take 15 necrotic and poison damage if they’re
within 10 squares of the drider. Finally, it can use Darkfire.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>There are two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: a drider fanglord, a drow arachnomancer, and 3 drow warriors. Here’s
some of that “favored champion” action.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: 2 fanglords, 1 shadowspinner, and a demonweb terror spider. This
all-spider group could be an elite unit in a drow settlement, or an unhinged
hermit family.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like the new take on driders as the favored of Lolth. As I say above, it
makes more sense than the previous backstory for them, because I never thought
that “oh no, I have been cursed with awesome power” made much sense. I mean,
yeah, you’re now a horrible half-spider monster, but for Lolth worshippers that
should be a plus.</p>

<p>Mechanically they pair really well with drow: the drow stat blocks lack any
heavy frontliners, and both the standard Drider and the Fanglord fit neatly into
that gap. The web powers from the Shadowspinner and Fanglord also do much to
benefit drow warriors or other lurkers, granting them easy and potentially
long-lasting combat advantage.</p>

<p>Drow have both fascinated and horrified people since AD&amp;D 1st Edition or
thereabouts. Their early descriptions leaned very hard into “evil elf
dominatrix” imagery, and their dark skin meant this portrait was often
considered racist as well as sexist.</p>

<p>4e seems to attempt to get away from these early unfortunate implications by
de-emphasizing the S&amp;M bits, and making your average drow look different from a
brown-skinned human. Depending on the specific illustration, drow skin varies
from pitch-black to light purple.</p>

<p>Drow are present both in the Monster Manual and in the Vault, though there
they’re part of a larger “Elf” entry.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Elves, Eladrin and Drow all descend from the same sapient fey people, which was
originally created by Corellon and went through something of a diaspora back at
the dawn of creation. Eladrin native to the Feywild are the closest to those
progenitors, still worshipping Corellon as their main deity. Elves diverged from
them after centuries of living in the world, and tend to worship Sehanine,
Melora or the primal spirits.</p>

<p>The Drow were recruited into the worship of Lolth and rose up against their
kin. They were driven into the Underdark and built a thriving but nightmarish
civilization there. The assumption seems to be that drow appearance diverged by
the same natural processes that applied to elves, as a form of adaptation for
their new environment. Other editions had the dark skin be a curse, which,
again, had its Unfortunate Implications.</p>

<p>Drow build great cities in the Underdark, which house a cruel and hierarchical
society fanatically devoted to Lolth. Lolth’s priestesses are at the top of the
heap and their ranks are only open to women. Men tend to get a little less
respect, but still all other positions of authority are open to drow of any
gender. Intrigue and backstabbing are extremely common at all levels, both
internally and externally. Drow foreign policy can be summed up as “raid those
weaker than you for plunder and slaves, make alliances to whose of equal or
greater power until you can backstab them”. The Monster Vault outright says that
if the drow stopped fighting each other and united into a single empire, they’d
be a major existential threat.</p>

<p>When fighting, drow favor light armor and swords (particularly fencing weapons),
with hand crossbows being the preferred ranged weapon. These are frequently
poisoned. Drow always prefer ambushes and guerilla tactics to anything
resembling a fair fight. They also use a whole lot of spider-themed magic,
both divine and arcane.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>All drow are Medium Fey Humanoids, have Darkvision, and one of two minor-action
encounter powers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a Cloud of Darkness that lasts for a turn, blocks line of sight on a Close
Burst 1 and blinds everyone who enters it, with the drow being immune to all
of this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Darkfire, a Ranged 10 attack that targets Reflex, and makes the target grant
combat advantage for a turn, during which they also can’t benefit from
concealment or invisibility.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can use them to make other drow stat blocks. Drow usually move at Speed 6.</p>

<p>We start with the <strong>Drow Warrior</strong> from the Monster Manual. It’s a Level 11
Lurker with 83 HP, trained in Perception, Dungeoneering, Intimidation and
Stealth. The warrior wears mail, and fights with a rapier in one hand and a hand
crossbow in another. Both the blade and the bolts are coated in Drow Poison: a
hit with either weapon triggers an additional attack against Fortitude, which in
turn inflicts a -2 attack penalty (save ends). On the first failed save the
target is also weakened, and on the second they fall unconscious until the end
of the encounter! The warrior can also use use sneak attacks on its melee and
ranged attacks, and it has the Darkfire power.</p>

<p>My impression is that this is meant to be a common drow soldier, which should
help explain why everyone else considers them to be so scary.</p>

<p>The MV-only <strong>Drow Stalker</strong> is a less complicated minion version of the
Warrior. A Level 12 Minion Lurker, it too has a sword and a hand crossbow, and
can deal extra damage against targets that cannot see it. The crossbow also
causes ongoing poison damage on a hit (save ends). It has Cloud of Darkness,
which is how it gets its extra damage.</p>

<p>The <strong>Drow Arachnomancer</strong> is an arcane spellcaster present in both books. It’s
Level 13 Artillery (Leader) with 94 HP and training in a host of skills: Arcana,
Dungeoneering and Perception, plus Intimidate and Stealth in the MM version. Its
leaderly bit comes from Lolth’s Judgement, a passive trait which grants +2 to
attacks for a turn to all spider allies that can see the arachnomancer whenever
it hits with an attack. We’ll see plenty of spider monsters when we hit the S
entries, but for now I’ll just note driders also count as spiders.</p>

<p>The arachnomancer’s basic attack is a Spider Rod in the MM and a Scourge in the
MV. The rod does piteous damage, while the scourge benefits from the math
fix. Both attacks immobilize on a hit (save ends). Its main at-will ranged
attack is the Venom Ray, which has a range of 10, targets Reflex, and does both
immediate and ongoing poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>It also has a few encounter spells. Spider Curse makes spectral spiders crawl
all over a target. It’s a Ranged 20 attack that targets Will, does both
immediate and ongoing necrotic damage, and weakens (save ends both). Venom Blast
is a Close Blast 5 that targets Fortitude and does poison damage, half on a
miss.</p>

<p>The MM version has a third encounter power, Lolth’s Grasp, which covers an Area
Burst 4 within 10 in those spectral spiders. It targets Reflex and restrains on
a hit (save ends). The spider zone remains until the end of the encounter, and
anyone who starts their turn there takes 10 necrotic damage. Drow are immune to
all of this. Finally, both versions of the arachnomancer can use Cloud of
Darkness.</p>

<p>The MV-only <strong>Drow Venomblade</strong> is a Level 13 Skirmisher with 124 HP, trained in
Perception, Acrobatics and Stealth. It uses a longsword in one hand and a
shortsword in the other. Both count as basic attacks, and do ongoing 5 poison
damage on a hit (save ends). The Blade Mastery ability allows this drow to make
attacks with both weapons as a single action, and it also knows Cloud of
Darkness. Pretty simple!</p>

<p>The MM-only <strong>Drow Blademaster</strong> is similar in concept but more powerful. A
Level 13 Elite Skirmisher with 248 HP, its blades apparently aren’t poisoned,
but it has several fancy techniques at its disposal. Excruciating Stab does a
lot more damage than the basic longsword attack and stuns (save ends)! It
recharges on 5-6. Whirlwind Attack allows the drow to make a longsword attack
against everyone on a Close Burst 1, and a shortsword attack against anyone hit
by the longsword. It recharges on a 4-6. Finally, it can make a free longsword
attack against anyone who makes an opportunity attack against it.</p>

<p>Our last entry is the MM-only <strong>Drow Priest</strong> tells me they’re using “priest” as
a gender-neutral word here. She is a Level 15 Controller (Leader) with 139 HP
and Speed 7, trained in Bluff, Insight, Intimidate, Religion and Stealth. She
projects Lolth’s Authority, granting +1 to attacks and +2 to damage for any drow
or spider ally who can see her.</p>

<p>Her basic attack is a somewhat weak mace, but once bloodied she grows spider
mandibles and can bite for considerably more damage. Her main ranged attack is
the Pain Web, which has range 5, targets Reflex, does necrotic damage, and makes
the target immobilized and weakened (save ends both). All of this at-will!</p>

<p>With the aid of a willing drow ally, the priestess can invoke Lolth’s
Wrath. The ally <em>explodes</em>, showering everyone in a close burst 5 with gore and
spectral spiders, which attack Reflex and do a heap of necrotic damage on a
hit. This recharges on a 6, so it could happen more than once per fight. A good
use for minions.</p>

<p>As a minor action she can use Spider Link, which transfers up to 22 points of
damage from the priestess to a spider or drow within 5 squares of her. She can’t
transfer more damage than the creature has HP remaining, making this a good use
for elite spiders. The priestess also knows Darkfire.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 1 drow arachnomancer, 2 drow warriors, 1 mezzodaemon, 5 grimlock
minions, and 2 blade spiders. Looks like a typical drow war party to me, sent
away from their home with a specific goal in mind. They bring in some
summoned/enslaved muscle along.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 1 drow priestess, 1 drow blademaster, 1 umber hulk, and 3 drow
warriors. Now this is something you might find deep within drow territory, a
priestess and her personal bodyguard complete with a showy thrall.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Did WotC succeed in shedding some of their Unfortunate Implications when it
comes to drow? The descriptions here make me want to think they had some
success, but for all I know 5e backtracked on all of this in the name of
nostalgia.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This is our third and final post on drakes, covering the two species that appear
in the Monster Vault but not on the Monster Manual. It’s is part of a series! Go
<a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<h2 id="ambush-drake">Ambush Drake</h2>

<p>This species seem to be a Monster Vault original. At least, it doesn’t seem to
appear on any of the Monster Manuals. According to the MV, Ambush Drakes “roam
the plains” and frequently attack lone travelers or even whole
caravans. No mention seems to be made of domesticated ambush drakes.</p>

<p>These Medium drakes are Level 6 Skirmishers with 71 HP, making them slightly
more dangerous than even rage drakes. They run at speed 6, and fly at speed 4
(clumsy). They’re also trained in Stealth. This tells me they likely use their
flight ability to scout their surroundings or to silently approach unwary prey
from above, but when they fight it’s with feet on the ground.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a claw, which can also be employed in a Shifting Strike
that allows the drake to shift 1 square before or after the attack. When
bloodied, they grow Ravenous and gain the ability to shift 2 squares towards a
bloodied enemy as an at-will minor action.</p>

<h2 id="bloodseeker-drake">Bloodseeker Drake</h2>

<p>These Medium drakes first appear on the Monster Manual 2. As their name implies,
bloodseekers have a keen sense of smell that’s specially attuned to
blood. Domesticated specimens are prized for their tracking ability and used as
hunting and patrol animals, but they get a bit hard to control when in the
presence of too much blood.</p>

<p>Bloodseeker Drakes are Level 4 Soldiers with 53 HP. They run with speed 6, and
are trained in Perception. They attack with a bite that does extra damage
against bloodied targets, and if a bloodied enemy adjacent to the drake shifts,
they can make a bite as an opportunity attack against that enemy. This is useful
because shifts don’t draw such attacks normally.</p>

<p>The MM2 version has a few additional traits that were removed - it was immune to
fear while within 2 squares of an ally, and had an extra +5 to track bloodied
creatures on top of its Perception training. I don’t see any problem in
reinstating these abilities if you want to. Them being gone seems to be more due
to a general hardening of the “only show combat-relevant information in stat
blocks” stance in the MV than due to any balance concerns.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>This ended up being a short article, since only those two species didn’t appear
in the first Monster Manual. I like the bloodseekers, but ambush drakes feel a
bit context-less to me. “Wild creature that attacks on sight” is not exactly
something that stands out in D&amp;D, you know? Giving them a function when tamed by
humanoids would help giving them some more flavor.</p>

<p>In this post we’ll continue to look at drakes, covering the rest of the ones
present in the MM.</p>

<h2 id="pseudodragon">Pseudodragon</h2>

<p>Ever since Kitty Pride from the X-Men got her pint-sized pet dragon, lots of
people have wanted one for their own characters. D&amp;D 3.x finally granted that
wish by introducing pseudodragons as a familiar option in one of its early
sourcebooks. They return here as a type of drake, being of Small size, and are
present in both books.</p>

<p>While needlefang drakes are just “cat-sized”, pseudodragons pretty much <em>are</em>
cats, at least personality-wise. Also of note is the fact that they’re really
smart! The MM version has Int 6, and the MV equivalent not only has Int 9 but
also has two languages listed in its stat block (Common and Draconic). They’re
both still classed as Natural Beasts, so you could interpret that as meaning
they can understand these languages but aren’t capable of speaking
them. According to the MM, they purr, hiss, chirp and growl in the same
situations a cat would emit each of these noises.</p>

<p>In the wild, they’re predators and scavengers, but usually stick to small prey
and don’t attack animals unless threatened. Their high intelligence makes them
highly valued as pets, as well.</p>

<p>MM pseudodragons are Level 3 Lurkers with 40 HP. They walk with speed 4 and fly
with speed 8 (hover). They attack with a bite, or with a stinger that does the
same amount of damage with some ongoing poison damage on top (save ends) and
recharges on 3-6. Both of these count as basic attacks, allowing the
pseudodragon to use the stinger when it performs a Flyby Attack. This, as usual,
lets them fly their speed without drawing opportunity attacks and make a basic
attack at any point.</p>

<p>They also have the ability to turn invisible when they stand still. This is a
standard action that recharges whenever the critter is damaged, which makes it
useful both for lying in ambush or for escaping an ambush gone wrong.</p>

<p>The MV pseudodragon has the same level, role, HP and speed, but trades Flyby
Attack for a less powerful effect on its bite that allows it to fly 4 squares
without worrying about opportunity attacks. The stinger remains a basic attack
but is also a bit more restricted, as it can only be used on a target that can’t
see the pseudodragon. To make up for this, its Invisibility power now allows it
to move, and only ends when the pseudodragon makes an attack.</p>

<p>All of this adds up to a more lurkerish monster, which will charge its chosen
target with a stinger attack while invisible, then use the bite combined with
its high fly speed to get away.</p>

<h2 id="spitting-drake">Spitting Drake</h2>

<p>Spitting Drakes are Medium, and got their name from their ability to spit gobs
of acid. This is their main weapon when hunting, and they’re also easily
domesticated to serve as (somewhat messy) guard animals. In the wild, they’ll
sometimes join guard drake packs, which I think is an interesting worldbuilding
detail. They’re present in both books but their stat block is the same in both
cases.</p>

<p>These creatures are Level 3 Artillery with 38 HP, and run with speed 7. Their
bite, as standard for artillery, is kinda weak. Their acid spit is a Ranged 10
attack targetting Reflex and doing acid damage.</p>

<h2 id="rage-drake">Rage Drake</h2>

<p>When the books say larger drakes are harder to tame, they’re talking about Rage
Drakes. Our first Large drake, it also has the Mount keyword. It appears in both
the MM and the MV.</p>

<p>Rage Drakes definitly didn’t get this name because they’re gentle! Adult
specimens are outright impossible to tame, but a trainer that starts with a
hatchling can make it into a combat mount better than any warhorse.</p>

<p>Wild rage drakes are highly territorial hunters. Like other drakes, they’re also
social creatures who gather in clutches. In fact, a solitary rage drake will
sometimes invite itself into a clutch or guard drakes or other smaller species
and become its leader. So yes, it’s possible for your PC party to run into a
single drake clutch composed of rage, spitting and guard drakes, all wild and
all hungry.</p>

<p>Rage drakes are Level 5 Brutes with 77 HP. They have a single basic attack in
the form of a bite, but also have a slightly weaker claw attack. Their Raking
Charge ability allows them to charge and make two claw attacks.</p>

<p>When bloodied, Rage Drakes freak out! They become immune to fear, and gain +2 to
hit and +5 to damage on all their attacks. If they’re serving as a mount, the
rider also gains a +2 to hit on all of <em>their</em> attacks.</p>

<p>The MV version is largely identical, save for the facts that its damage math has
been fixed and the damage bonus from being enraged is only a +2. The accuracy
bonus for the drake and its rider remains the same.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The MM gives us three for the entire “Drake” entry:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 2: 2 guard drakes, 2 elf archers, 1 elf scout. A patrol and their guard
animals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 1 pseudodragon, 1 human mage, 2 human guards, and 2 human
bandits. Either a bandit squad of bandit-hunting militia, with the mage having
brought his familiar along.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 1 rage drake and a band of assorted lizardfolk protecting their swamp
home.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I really, really like this version of drakes, mainly because of the lore they
bring along. Domesticated drakes should be a common sight in any society, which
does a lot to make the world feel not only magical but also fresh. I’m actually
a bit disappointed that 5th edition seems to have gone back on this and made
them related to dragons again.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>These beasties seem to be new to Fourth Edition, at least as presented here. If
I remember correctly, the things 3.x called Drakes were related to dragons -
they had the Dragon “monster class” but weren’t technically dragons
themselves. As a GM you would use drakes when you wanted a “lite” dragon
encounter.</p>

<p>Here, the name is basically another bit of Behemoth-like medieval taxonomy
employed by the people people who live in the 4e implied setting. A drake is a
clawed, carnivorous reptile that’s not big enough to be called a Behemoth. There
are several species of drake: some walk on two legs and have limited
manipulation capability, some walk on all fours, some even fly!</p>

<p>I’ve heard that this means they correspond to the smaller varieties of dinosaur,
but I think that’s not quite true. While several of them are similar to certain
species of dinosaurs, they’re less so than behemoths (where you often can draw a
direct visual parallel between a given behemoth and the real-world counterpart).</p>

<p>Drakes in the wild are aggressive and territorial predators, more likely to
attack a group of humans than a wolf or bear. Despite this, they’re rather easy
to tame, and can be frequently encountered not only as guard or attack animals,
but as pets or even mounts!</p>

<p>In short, drakes pretty much fill the same roles as dogs. If you want to make
your particular version of the setting feel more fantastical you could even say
that it has no dogs, since the sapients here never domesticated wolves. It’s all
drakes all the time.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault kinda backs down from this idea a bit, saying that drakes are
more aggressive and “alien” than corresponding domesticated mammals and such
tend to be feared by common people, though they are often encountered in the
service of hostile humanoids. Personally, I would disregard this bit completely
and keep them as a common dog-substitute for all sapient peoples.</p>

<p>Both books agree that the larger varieties of drake are harder to domesticate,
which would mean good old warhorses are still more common than rage drakes.</p>

<p>All Drakes are Natural Beasts with the Reptile keyword. Between the Monster
Manual and the Monster Vault there are quite a few of them, so we’ll split this
single entry into multiple posts. This is part 1.</p>

<h2 id="spiretop-drake">Spiretop Drake</h2>

<p>Present only in the MM, this Small drake is a Level 1 Skirmisher with 29 HP. It
waddles at Speed 4 but flies with speed 8 and hover capability. They’re a social
species that likes to nest in high places, which means clutches of the things
nest in towers and spires in large cities and swoop down to steal shiny things
from unwary passerby.</p>

<p>Unusually, it has two basic attacks: a bite with its toothed beak that works as
usual, and a claw attack that targets Reflex. The claw attack does a measly 1
damage, but a hit also allows the drake to steal a small object from the target,
like a single coin, vial or scroll. The fact that the snatching claw is a basic
attack is important, because it means the drake can use it as part of a Flyby
Attack, where it flies 8 squares while immune to opportunity attacks and
performs a basic attack at any point along the movement.</p>

<p>So yeah, having your small, shiny, plot-critical McGuffin stolen by a pack of
spiretop drakes is a hazard in urban adventures. Ideally they’d nest atop a
crumbling abandoned tower filled with enough bad stuff to count as a dungeon. As
a level 1 monster it’s not really affected by the math bug, so you can use it
as-is.</p>

<h2 id="guard-drake">Guard Drake</h2>

<p>In the wild guard drakes are pack hunters, but they got this name because
they’re very commonly used as guard animals, since it’s very easy to train them
for this role. Basically, if someone in the real world would use rottweilers for
a job, they’ll use guard drakes in D&amp;D. Yes, even as pets.</p>

<p>This Small drake has nearly identical stat blocks in both books. It’s a Level 2
Brute with 48 HP and a single bite attack that does extra damage if the drake is
within two squares of an ally. This makes then pair well with any melee monster.</p>

<p>The only difference between the MM and MV versions is that the MM version is
<em>immune to fear</em>, which is an interesting detail. I’m inclined to keep it, since
it’s flavorful and unlikely to make a PC completely ineffective even at this
level.</p>

<h2 id="needlefang-drake-swarm">Needlefang Drake Swarm</h2>

<p>From what I hear people saying on the Internet, needlefang drake swarms have
been responsible for more PC deaths than most other monsters in this
edition. Let’s see why.</p>

<p>Needlefang drakes are cat-sized bipedal lizards, though I guess they’re more
like angry chihahuas in temperament. A single individual is not really
dangerous, and I imagine some people might want to keep one as a pet. In the
wild, they gather in large packs that can take down much larger prey and “strip
it to the bone in seconds” according to the book, which also implies some people
keep whole swarms of them as “living traps”. Beware needlefang drake hoarders!</p>

<p>A swarm of needlefang drakes is Medium in size and counts as a Level 2 Soldier
with 38 HP and the Swarm keyword. Like all swarms it takes half damage from
melee and ranged attacks, and extra damage from close and area attacks. It’s
immune to fear, and has a Swarm Attack aura 1 that allows it to make a free
basic attack against each enemy that begins its turn inside.</p>

<p>This swarm has two actions: a Swarm of Teeth as a basic attack, which deals
extra damage against prone targets; and Pull Down, which targets Fortitude and
does no damage, but knocks the target prone on a hit.</p>

<p>So why are needlefang drake swarms so dang deadly? Well, as MM1 soldiers, their
accuracy is 2 points higher than it should be (something which would be fixed by
the new monster math). So a swarm has no reason to ever spend its standard
action on anything but Pull Down, which will hit even tough fighters very
reliably and set them up for an increased-damage free attack from the aura
which will hit even <em>more</em> reliably due to combat advantage.</p>

<p>To make things worse, if you have multiple swarms in play they can position
themselves so that anyone they knock down is subject to aura attacks from <em>all</em>
of them. That amount of damage per round can take a level 1-2 PC down to 0 quite
fast. And to top it off, there’s no in-setting reason for needlefang drakes to
follow the sort of combat etiquette that prevents them from attacking downed
PCs, so they can potentially keep making free attacks until those PCs hit their
death threshold.</p>

<p>These tiny terrors are just the thing to spruce up a kobold lair or the hideout
of a sadistic villain, but don’t overuse them. Or at least make sure your wizard
knows Thunderwave before using more than one swarm at a time.</p>
