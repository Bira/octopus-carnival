<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Orcus has been in the game since at least AD&amp;D 1st Edition, and is the strongest
monster in the 4e Monster Manual. He is not in the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Orcus is the known by many titles, such as the Prince of Undead, Demon Lord of
Undeath, and Blood Lord. He’s a Demon Lord, which is not a formal title but a
terse way of saying Orcus is one of the strongest demons in all of the Abyss,
powerful enough to challenge the gods. Orcus wants to destroy the gods
themselves, particularly the Raven Queen so he can usurp her dominion over
Death.</p>

<p>Orcus hates all life to an even greater extent than your average demon. He can’t
stand to be near anything living, and even his demon servitors are undead. His
domain is named Thanatos and covers an entire layer of the Abyss, being
predictably composed of an endless sucession of mausoleums, graveyards, dismal
moors, and other lifeless corpse-filled places. I’m guessing that where the
Shadowfell is moody gothic poetry, Thanatos is death metal.</p>

<p>The demon lord himself seems to be stuck somewhere between life and undeath, as
his corpulent form seems either alive but diseased, or undead depending on which
parts you look at. He wields a heavy mace with a haft of ruby-studded obsidian
and a head made from a gigantic skull, a weapon known as the <em>wand of
Orcus</em>. There are multiple stories about the origin of the skull. Some say it
belonged to a noble and just god, others to a mortal hero (in which case it was
magically enlarged). In either case there is nothing of that person’s good left
inside. Those killed by the Wand rise as undead loyal to Orcus.</p>

<p>Orcus’s main stronghold is Everlost, an obsidian palace at the center of
Thanatos built over a bottomless chasm whose walls are completely covered in
crypts and mausoleums. He also shares the layer with his Exarchs, lieutenants
imbued with a shard of his power. One example is Dorensain the Ghoul King, who
presides over ghouls and cannibalism and lives in a section of Thanatos named
the White Kingdom (because it’s entirely made of bones).</p>

<p>There are many cults to Orcus in the world, whose membership consists of people
who want to be “rewarded” with undeath, or who want to kill the world for other
reasons. These cults tend to be a lot subtler than those of Yeenoghu or
Baphomet, who also got name-checked in this book. They gather in secret in
places like graveyards, and do things like human sacrifice, blood-drinking, and
covertly spreading disease. They don’t see undeath itself as holy, but as a tool
to help with the goal of extinguishing all life. Every cultist aims to become
some kind of powerful undead like a royal mummy, death knight, vampire, or
lich. Most don’t manage, of course, but they consider even being turned into a
skeleton or zombie after death to be a good service to their demon master.</p>

<p>The most powerful among Orcus’ priesthood are given the knowledge to summon as
Aspect of Orcus, a miniature version of the demon lord himself created from his
power. Aspects have no mental link of any kind to the original, though they have
the same personality. They usually disappear when the task for which they were
conjured is done.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>This entry has a lot of related stat blocks, and we’ll look at them in order of
level.</p>

<h3 id="crimson-acolyte">Crimson Acolyte</h3>

<p>Any of the stat blocks we already saw for humans or others could work as a
cultist, but this one has some Orcus-specific flavor. Crimson acolytes are
humans, and therefore Medium Natural Humanoids. They’re Level 7 Skirmishers with
76 HP. They wear leather armor.</p>

<p>The acolyte wields a <strong>scythe</strong> in combat, which does a mix of physical and
necrotic damage and has a +2 attack bonus against bloodied targets. It also
marks them as a total edgelord.</p>

<p>They also have an ability called <strong>Crimson Path</strong>, an at-will minor action that
allows them to shift 1 square (2 when bloodied).</p>

<p>Their tactics are simple: use Crimson Path to get into flanking positions and
scythe away, preferring bloodied characters as targets. The scythe’s damage is
only 3 points short of where it should be, so fixing it is easy.</p>

<h3 id="deathpriest-of-orcus">Deathpriest of Orcus</h3>

<p>Deathpriests are Medium Natural Humanoids (usually humans) and Level 9
Controllers (Leaders) with 96 HP. They wear mail, and have speed 5. They also
project an aura called <strong>Death’s Embrace</strong>, which has a radius of 10 and
inflicts a -2 penalty to any death saves that happen inside.</p>

<p>Deathpriests start fighting at range using <strong>Rays of Black Fire</strong> (Ranged 10
vs. Reflex) that do fire and necrotic damage and grant an ally in sight a +2
bonus to its next attack. They really want to get right into the fray, though,
so that they can use their <strong>Dark Blessing</strong> (Close Burst 2 vs Fortitude). This
does necrotic damage and pushes all enemies caught in the burst 1 square, and
gives all allies a +2 bonus to AC until the end of the encounter. After they
spend their blessing, they’ll use <strong>mace</strong> attacks that do a mix of physical and
necrotic damage, or retreat and go back to using their rays.</p>

<p>The deathpriest’s damage is a full 9 points less than it should be, and really
needs a fix.</p>

<h3 id="deathprest-hierophant">Deathprest Hierophant</h3>

<figure class="left">

</figure>

<p>This is likely Orcus’ most powerful living agent in any given campaign world,
and well on the way to becoming a lich or something equivalent. It’s a Level 21
Elite Controller with 382 HP.</p>

<p>The hierophant projects an <strong>Aura of Decay</strong> out to 5 squares, which inflicts -2
to all defenses on any living enemies inside. At the time of writing this was
the same as saying “all enemies”, but by the end of 4e we had like three
different ways of making PC vampires, so they’d be immune.</p>

<p>The hierophant’s most powerful attack is <strong>Word of Orcus</strong> (close burst 5
vs. Fortitude; recharge 6), which does necrotic damage and stuns (save
ends). Any undead allies in the burst also regain 15 HP. If that’s not charged,
there’s the <strong>Word of Death</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will; recharge 4-6) which does
psychic damage and dazes (save ends). And if neither is charged there’s the good
old <strong>mace</strong> which does physical damage and ongoing necrotic damage (save ends).</p>

<p>The frequent dazes and stuns are pretty dangerous, but the hierophant’s damage
is a full 20 points behind where it should be for all attacks except for the
mace, which is “just” 10 points behind.</p>

<h3 id="aspect-of-orcus">Aspect of Orcus</h3>

<p>The Aspect of Orcus is a Large Elemental Humanoid (Demon), and a Level 24 Elite
Brute with 560 HP. It has darkvision and trained Perception. It’s immune to
poison and disease, has 20 necrotic resistance, and 10 variable resistance that
it can switch 3 times per encounter. It runs at speed 6 or flies at speed 8
(clumsy).</p>

<p>The Aspect projects a <strong>Lesser Aura of Death</strong> out to 10 squares. Enemies caught
inside take 5 necrotic damage, or 10 if the Aspect is bloodied. It fights with a
<strong>Skull Mace</strong> that’s likely a lesser copy of the Wand: a hit deals a
disappointing amount of physical damage and weakens (save ends).</p>

<p>More dangerous is the <strong>Tail Lash</strong> the Aspect can use on any enemy that moves
or shifts to a square adjacent to it, as a reaction. This does a bit more damage
than the mace, and knocks the target prone.</p>

<p>After all the hype in the lore section, I find the Aspect of Orcus to be a bit
of a disappointment. I imagine it works well as a “Summon” when backed up by a
hierophant and high-level undead. If Orcus himself sends out a lieutenant to do
his work, though, he’s going to send a balor, an atropal, or Dorensain.</p>

<p>If you plan to use the Aspect, fixing its damage is crucial, as it’s 25 points
smaller than it should be.</p>

<h3 id="dorensain-exarch-of-orcus">Dorensain, Exarch of Orcus</h3>

<p>The Ghoul King looks like, well, a ghoul, but one that walks upright and is
dressed in what passes for elegant finery in his kingdom: a coat made of human
flesh over leather armor that’s also surely made from people. A crown of bones
rests on his head, and he wields a staff named Toothlust, made from somebody’s
spine and teeth.</p>

<p>Dorensain is a Medium Natural Humanoid (Undead) and a Level 27 Elite Skirmisher
with 508 HP. He has super-high Initiative, trained Perception, and
darkvision. Like the Aspect above, he’s immune to disease and poison and has 20
necrotic resistance. He also has 10 radiant vulnerability. He runs at speed 8.</p>

<p>He fights with <strong>Toothlust</strong> in combat, and the bites of that weapon deal
immediate and ongoing physical damage (save ends). That fine coat is the <strong>Cloak
of Mouths</strong>, whose bites do physical damage and slow (save ends). You know
you’re looking at a sophisticated ghoul when he uses utensils to eat you.</p>

<p>Dorensain can sometimes pull off a <strong>Ravenous Frenzy</strong> maneuver (recharge 6),
which allows him to move his speed without provoking opportunity attacks and
make a Cloak of Mouths attack on anyone he passes by. He can also teleport 12
squares as a move action (recharge 4-6).</p>

<p>The Ghoul King is difficult to pin down, and apparently good at keeping his
enemies slowed and vulnerable to whatever honor guard he travels with.</p>

<h3 id="orcus">Orcus</h3>

<p>The Big Goat Cheese himself is a Gargantuan Elemental Humanoid (Demon) and a
Level 33 Solo Brute with 1525 HP! As I said above, he is the highest-level
monster in the entire Monster Manual.</p>

<p>As expected, he has darkvision and trained Perception. His ground speed is 6,
and he flies at speed 10 and teleports at speed 6, at-will. Orcus is immune to
disease, poison and <em>necrotic damage</em>, and has the usual demonic Variable
Resistance 10 (3/encounter). He is not particularly vulnerable to radiant
damage. And then there are the auras.</p>

<p>The first is the <strong>Aura of Death</strong>, which is 20 squares wide and deals 10
necrotic damage to enemies caught inside. This increases to 20 while Orcus is
bloodied.</p>

<p>The second is <strong>The Dead Rise</strong> (aura 6), which turns all covered squares into
difficult terrain for enemies, even flying ones! I guess it’s due to all the
grasping skeletal hands bursting out of the ground and tormented specters flying
around. Any dead creature inside, except those killed by the Wand of Orcus, rise
as abyssal ghoul myrmidons under Orcus’ control.</p>

<p>Why are creatures killed by the wand exempt from this? Because due to a little
trait called <strong>Master of Undeath</strong>, victims of the Wand rise as <em>dread wraiths</em>
at the start of Orcus’ next turn if they’re still dead by then.</p>

<p>The <strong>Wand of Orcus</strong> itself is not all that impressive. It’s Reach 4 and does a
mix of physical and necrotic damage on a hit. You should just about double its
damage to get it to expected levels.</p>

<p>A bit more dangerous are Orcus’ two recharge attacks. <strong>Necrotic Burst</strong> (close
burst 10 vs. Fortitude; recharge 6) is very accurate, does necrotic damage and
heals all undead allies for 20 HP. <strong>Touch of Death</strong> (Melee 4 vs. Fortitude;
recharge 6) is the big one: a hit reduces the target to 0 HP, bypassing any and
all resistances. A miss deals damage equal to the target’s bloodied value. A
couple of good whacks with the fixed Wand after hitting with this, and you
have a brand new dread wraith!</p>

<p>When an enemy moves or shifts to a square adjacent to Orcus, he can use a <strong>Tail
Lash</strong> as a reaction, doing a bit less damage than the wand, stunning the target
for a turn and knocking them prone.</p>

<p>Orcus suffers a bit from same problems that plagued 3e boss monsters, which are
that he has few ranged options and is susceptible to a bunch of conditions that
limit his actions. Those are less of a problem than they would have been in 3e,
but you still might want to give him something like a dragon’s Action Recovery
ability.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have a whole bunch!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 9: 1 deathpriest, 4 crimson acolytes, 2 battle wights. Your typical
cult, with living and undead members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 1 hierophant, 5 abyssal ghoul myrmidons (minions), 2 rot harbingers,
1 rot slinger. The Hierophant and his honor guard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 24: 1 hierophant, 3 blood fiends, 1 aspect of Orcus. An alternate
configuration, and yet another indication that blood fiends should really be
undead demons instead of abominations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 28: Dorensain, 2 dread wraiths, 2 epic liches, and 10 abyssal ghoul
myrmidons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 34: Orcus, 2 atropals, and 8 lich vestiges. What, you thought the big
solo was going to fight alone?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Orcus and his related monsters suffer from a lot of the problems endemic to
the early Monster Manual, with the epic stat blocks getting hit the hardest as
usual. However, those are all eminently fixable.</p>

<p>My favorite thing about this whole entry is that it’s here at all! My impression
with AD&amp;D 2nd Edition, and with 3.x, was that they viewed threats of this
caliber as something the PCs weren’t expected to fight and win. They either had
no stats, or they had overpowered numbers calculated to be beyond the reach of
even the most powerful group. This impression is probably also colored by my
memories of the largely oppressive and adversarial nature of the DMs of the
time.</p>

<p>Orcus is, well, still quite powerful, but in a way that’s supposed to make him a
suitable “last boss” for a campaign. Sure, he has an attack that reduces people
to 0 HP and powers that turn dead characters into epic undead under his
command… but epic PCs are demigods who can resurrect once per day on their
own, and epic leader PCs are up to the challenge of keeping their buddies from
dying at all. In fact the Big O might actually need a little boost to prevent
stun-locking by those epic characters.</p>

<p>Mechanical details aside, this feels right. If I manage to reach level 30 in a
campaign, I want to end it with a bang by taking out one of the big name
canonical demon lords. And when the next campaign starts, I want them to <em>stay
dead</em>.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Orcs have been in D&amp;D since the beginning, featuring in the Humanoid Power
Ladder as the 1HD Humanoid. They’re inspired by Tolkien’s orcs, and are present
both in the Monster Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>I didn’t expect this, but here we have an entry about sapient humanoids where
both books agree. Neither has anything nice to say about orcs.</p>

<p>Orcs compete fiercely with gnolls for the title of Least Reasonable
Humanoid. They worship Gruumsh, the one-eyed Chaotic Evil god of slaughter and
destruction, whose commandments result in behavior that’s almost
indistinguishable from that of a Yeenoghu worshipper. Being a god, Gruumsh
technically doesn’t want to see the world destroyed, but the difference is lost
on the poor sods on the receiving end of a raid by either set of worshippers.</p>

<p>Orcs organize themselves in large tribes who will usually move into a region,
take over a natural cave complex or an empty town (possibly after emptying it
themselves), and fortify it into a defensible base. Then they split into smaller
bands of scouts and raiders to methodically plunder the surrounding region, and
move on once there’s no more loot to be had. Sometimes a chief will take a
liking to a given home base and order the tribe to settle in it, which means
those raiding parties will range much farther out. Their preferred terrain are
hills and mountains, which means they end up fighting dwarves a lot of the time.</p>

<p>Orcs take slaves in their raids, but never manage to keep them for long because
they always end up working them to death in short order. They’re also gleefully
cannibalistic towards anyone not of their tribe, even other orcs. They routinely
work alongside ogres, because it’s super easy for them to bully ogres into
service.</p>

<p>Most GMs I know tend to tone down their campaign’s portrait of orcs from the
unrelenting badness described above. Eberron shows them in a much better light,
having not just one but <em>two</em> different Lawful Good orcish cultures dedicated to
guarding against aberrant and demonic invasions (respectively). Even in old D&amp;D
they were not always the opposition: hiring orcish mercenaries was a common
thing for adventurers to do, and it wasn’t always assumed that the orc
encampments you found in a given area were hostile and there to be
raided.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The numbers below were built with the “unrelenting badness” version of the lore
in mind, but they <em>could</em> be used for non-evil orcs with relatively little
change. It’s also possible to turn other “natural humanoid” stat blocks into
orcs by swapping signature traits around, as usual.</p>

<p>Orcs are Medium Natural Humanoids and typically Chaotic Evil. They have
low-light vision and base Speed 6.</p>

<p>Their other mechanical tricks change between books. In the Monster Manual all
orcs have a +2 bonus to speed when charging, and all non-minions have an attack
called <strong>Warrior’s Surge</strong>, which allows them to make a melee basic attack and
recover 25% of their HP. Most MM orcs are also trained in Endurance.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault makes the speed bonus less universal, and replaces Warrior’s
Surge with <strong>Savage Demise</strong>, which allows orcs to immediately <em>take a standard
action</em> when they drop to 0 HP. This is stronger than just making a basic
attack, because allows them to charge or use special attacks.</p>

<h3 id="orc-drudge-mm">Orc Drudge (MM)</h3>

<p>This level 4 minion is probably the closest thing you have to the classic 1HD
orc. It wears hide, wields a <strong>club</strong>, and gains the orc speed bonus to
charges.</p>

<p>There’s a level 9 version named the <strong>Orc Warrior</strong> which is described as
wearing nicer gear (scale, light shield, battleaxe), but has pretty much the
same mechanics.</p>

<h3 id="orc-savage-mv">Orc Savage (MV)</h3>

<p>A Level 4 Minion Brute, updating the Drudge above. Instead of a club, it carries
a bunch of <strong>handaxes</strong>, which it can use for melee or ranged attacks. It also
has Savage Demise, so they’ll always be able to attack at least once when they
die. Makes those controller AoEs a bit more of a double-edged sword. “I fireball
the horde!” “They all charge you while on fire!”</p>

<h3 id="orc-raider-mm">Orc Raider (MM)</h3>

<p>A Level 3 Skirmisher with 46 HP, representing a veteran who’s a little tougher
than the rank-and-file.</p>

<p>Raiders fight in melee with a <strong>Greataxe</strong> and throw <strong>Handaxes</strong> at
range. <strong>Killer’s Eye</strong> allows them to ignore cover and concealment when making
ranged attacks at a range of 5 squares or less, which will almost always be the
case. They also have Warrior’s Surge, which heals them for 11 HP.</p>

<h3 id="battletested-orc-mv">Battletested Orc (MV)</h3>

<p>Conceptually equivalent, but mechanically different from the Raider shown
above. This is a Level 3 Soldier with 50 HP. It wears scale, and wields a heavy
shield and a battleaxe, with some handaxes for ranged combat.</p>

<p>The <strong>Battleaxe</strong> deals +5 damage on a charge and have a higher base damage than
the <strong>handaxes</strong>, which means the orc will only really use the latter if there’s
some sort of chasm between it and the PCs.</p>

<p>It can use the battlaxe for a <strong>Hacking Frenzy</strong> (close burst 1; enemies only;
recharge 5-6), an all-out attack which marks everyone it hits for a turn but
makes the orc grant combat advantage for the same amount of time.</p>

<h3 id="orc-archer-mv">Orc Archer (MV)</h3>

<p>This archer is level 4 artillery and surprisingly dangerous! It has 42 HP, and
wields a longbow.</p>

<p>Basic <strong>longbow</strong> attacks do physical damage out to range 30, and push 1 square
on a hit. They can also fire a bunch of arrows at once in a <strong>concentrated
volley</strong> (area 1 within 20 vs. AC; at-will!). Finally they carry <strong>handaxes</strong>
for melee emergencies, and have Savage Demise for that one last volley.</p>

<h3 id="orc-berserker-mm">Orc Berserker (MM)</h3>

<p>This is a somewhat boring Level 4 Brute with 66 HP and a greataxe, which it uses
to make basic melee attacks. It has no other special abilities aside from
Warrior’s Surge.</p>

<h3 id="orc-reaver-mv">Orc Reaver (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 5 Skirmisher with 63 HP. It gets the charging speed bonus.</p>

<p>Reavers fight in melee with a <strong>battleaxe</strong> that allows them to shift 1 square
on a hit, and throw <strong>javelins</strong> at range which push the targets 1 square on a
hit. Once per encounter they can use <strong>Blood-Crazed Charge</strong> to make a charge
attack right after hitting with a standard one. And they have Savage Demise.</p>

<p>In short, these are far more interesting berserkers than the Orc Berserker.</p>

<h2 id="orc-eye-of-gruumsh-mm">Orc Eye of Gruumsh (MM)</h2>

<p>A priest of Gruumsh, whose initiation ritual consists of gouging out one of
their own eyeballs and eating it. This is the only instance of “intra-tribal”
cannibalism allowed in orc culture.</p>

<p>Eyes of Gruumsh are Level 5 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 64 HP. In
addition to Endurance, they’re also trained in Religion and Intimidate.</p>

<p>These priests fight with <strong>spears</strong> in melee, and have a variety of spells for
ranged combat. <strong>Eye of Wrath</strong> (Ranged 5 vs. Will) is a minor action fear
effect that inflicts -4 AC for a turn on a hit. <strong>Swift Arm of Destruction</strong>
(Ranged 5; recharge 5-6) allows an orc within range to make a melee basic attack
as a free action and regain 15 HP on a hit or 5 on a miss. And <strong>Chaos Hammer</strong>
(area burst 1 within 10 vs. Reflex; encounter) does force damage and knocks
targets prone on a hit. On a miss it still does half damage.</p>

<p>Warrior’s Surge and <strong>Death Strike</strong> round out its abilities. Death Strike is a
watered-down Savage Demise, allowing a free melee basic attack when the orc hits
0 HP.</p>

<p>Chaos Hammer is a good fight-opener: it’s not a friendly burst, but if the Eye
can use it before its buddies charge in, they’ll have an easier time hitting the
prone PCs. After that it’s mostly a matter of keeping Eye of Wrath on as many
PCs as possible and using Swift Arm on non-minion orcs. This orc’s healing
abilities make it a priority target, since it can make the fight a lot harder by
keeping the other orcs up for longer.</p>

<p>If you want to make the Eye more Monster Vault-compliant, you might want to
replace the healing with some sort of accuracy and damage bonus on the granted
attack.</p>

<h3 id="orc-rampager-mv">Orc Rampager (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 6 Brute has 90 HP and is another variation on the “berserker”
theme. It fights with a <strong>heavy flail</strong>, and its <strong>Berserk Flailing</strong> allows the
rampager to deal an automatic 5 damage to any enemies that start their turn
adjacent to it, as long as it can take opportunity actions. So this shuts down
if you daze the rampager, for example. Rampagers have Speed 6 and no charge
speed bonus.</p>

<p>In addition to basic attacks, the rampager can, well, <strong>Rampage</strong>. This allows
it to shift up to 3 squares and make basic attacks against three enemies during
the shift. It’s an at-will ability too, meaning there isn’t any reason not to
spam this every round. Rampagers are death blenders even if they don’t have any
edged weapons.</p>

<p>If they can’t reach an enemy, they can toss a <strong>Handaxe</strong> (Ranged 10) to do some
physical damage and push the enemies 1 square on a hit. And finally, there’s
Savage Demise for that one last rampage before they go.</p>

<h3 id="orc-pummeler-mv">Orc Pummeler (MV)</h3>

<p>A Level 6 Controller with 76 HP, and a rare martial controller at that.</p>

<p>Pummelers fight with huge <strong>Stone Mauls</strong> that knock prone on a hit, and once
per encounter they can do a <strong>Earthshaking Slam</strong> (Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude)
that does damage, dazes everyone it hits and automatically pushes everyone in
the area of effect 2 squares.</p>

<p>If someone makes an opportunity attack against the pummeler, it can counter with
an <strong>Intercepting Swat</strong> (recharge 4-6), which allows it to make a free basic
attack against the offender. This is labeled as a Free Action, which means
there’s no limit to the number of times it may be used in a round. And we also
have Savage Demise.</p>

<h3 id="orc-storm-shaman-mv">Orc Storm Shaman (MV)</h3>

<p>This likely represents another Gruumsh priest, but “Storm Shaman” is generic
enough that you could use it as a primal caster or even a priest of some less
evil god like Kord.</p>

<p>They’re Level 6 Artillery with 54 HP, who prefer to stay far away from their
enemies and attack with <strong>Lightning Strikes</strong> (ranged 30 vs. Reflex), which do
level-appropriate lightning damage to their targets and 5 to another enemy
within 5 squares of that.</p>

<p>Once the PCs close to medium range the shaman can use a <strong>Vengeful Whirlwind</strong>
(Area burst 1 within 10 vs. Fortitude; enemies only; recharges when first
bloodied), which does “thunder and lightning” damage and knocks prone on a
hit. After the enemy falls down, the shaman can still slide it 2 squares! On a
miss, the attack does half damage and the shaman slides the enemy 1 square.</p>

<p>And that’s not all! The whirwind persists for a turn as a zone that deals 10
thunder and lightning damage to anyone caught inside.</p>

<p>The shaman fights with a <strong>scimitar</strong> in melee, but only if it has no other
choice.</p>

<p>After the shaman is first bloodied, it starts <strong>Wind Walking</strong> until the end of
the encounter, which gives it a flight speed of 8 but requires it to land at the
end of every move. Savage demise completes the shaman’s repertoire.</p>

<h3 id="orc-bloodrager-mm">Orc Bloodrager (MM)</h3>

<p>Bloodragers are Level 7 Elite Brutes, likely representing champions or
subchiefs. They have 194 HP, but are much harder to kill than this number
indicates.</p>

<p>Bloodragers fight with <strong>Greataxes</strong>, have Warrior’ Surge, and can also make
basic attacks as a reaction when they’re hit by adjacent enemies. And any time
they hit a bloodied enemy with an attack, <strong>Blood for Blood</strong> makes them deal +5
damage and heal 10 HP.</p>

<p>Between their high HP pool, the trickle of healing from Blood for Blood, and the
48 HP healed by Warrior’s Surge, you’re going to be fighting the bloodrager for
a loooong time. It makes sense for it to have no MV equivalent, as it relies
entirely on a tactic that fell out of favor (monster healing).</p>

<h3 id="orc-chieftain-mm">Orc Chieftain (MM)</h3>

<p>Chieftains are Level 8 Elite Brutes with 216 HP and the Leader keyword. Their
leadership skills are represented as an aura 5 named <strong>Blood of the Enemy</strong>,
which grants bloodied allies inside a +2 bonus to damage.</p>

<p>Commanders fight with <strong>Greataxes</strong>, which have the High-Crit property, and can
<strong>Inspire Ferocity</strong> in an ally that just dropped to 0 HP as a reaction,
allowing them to make a melee basic attack before croaking. Warrior’s Surge is
its last ability, healing 54 HP.</p>

<p>With a bit of an update, chieftains make excellent additions to a party
otherwise composed of MV orcs, since I would definitely make Inspire Ferocity
stack with Savage Demise (the Ferocity attack happens first, then the action
from Savage Demise).</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The selection on any one of the books gives us enough variety to make entire
adventures with all-orc encounters, and this is what the large selection of
sample encounters gives us. Rather than listing them all in detail, I’ll mention
the non-orc monsters tossed in, since I would guess they’re a nice
representation of typical orc allies.</p>

<p>Over the several encounters listed, we have the following orc allies: dire
boars, dire wolves, ogres, and there’s even an oni here, though in this case I
would say the oni is running the show.</p>

<p>Mechanically, I think the Monster Vault orcs are by far the best. Despite the
name, Savage Demise is very effective and doesn’t run the risk of making fights
drag on for too long like Warrior’s Surge.</p>

<p>Lore-wise, well, there’s a reason orcs are almost always used as the main
example for why D&amp;D’s traditional take on “savage humanoids” is problematic. I
tend to prefer settings which make them at least equivalent to humans in
variety, where their alignment is an individual choice and not a species-wide
label. Eberron’s guardian orcs are quite nice as well. Wizards of the Coast has
recently committed to improving the way they portray orcs and other humanoids,
but I think we’ve yet to see the results of those efforts.</p>

<p>One interesting thing you could do is to use the lore above for <em>Gruumsh
worshippers</em> of any species. It would make perfect sense for Gruumsh to be a
jealous deity who demands exclusive worship even in a polytheistic setting, and
requires his worshippers to follow this violent raiding lifestyle. Sure, there
are orcs in there, but a little signature trait swapping you could have humans,
dwarves, and even elves filling the same role.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Jellies, slimes, molds, puddings. Collectively known as “oozes”, these are
likely the most iconic D&amp;D monsters not exempted from the OGL. Talk about
dragons all you want, but I’ll bet you far more adventuring parties have faced
(and died to) some kind of ooze than they did dragons. They’ve been in the game
since the beginning, and their variety has only increased as time went on. Here
they’re present in both books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Talking about “oozes” is like talking about “animals”. There’s so many types
that you can’t really describe them as a whole in anything but the most general
terms. They’re goopy, they’re mindless, they like damp and/or dark places, and
they eat just about any type of organic matter by dissolving it with their
acidic secretions.</p>

<p>As far as the inhabitants of 4e’s implied setting are concerned, oozes are just
a fact of life, like animals or plants. They’re natural creatures that have been
around forever and everyone knows they exist. Learning how to keep your basement
or root cellar ooze-free is probably a basic life skill.</p>

<p>The most sensible advice for any regular person who spots an ooze is to turn
around and leave. This is complicated by the fact that sometimes these creatures
wait in ambush. Also, adventurers are neither regular nor sensible, and they
like to delve into exactly the sort of place oozes thrive in, so they end up
running into these creatures much more often than civilians.</p>

<p>Oozes are drawn to heat and movement, so they often try to eat living creatures,
but they don’t have a preference for them over any other organic matter and can
subsist on dungeon crud just as well. Finding an unusually clean room or
corridor is a sure sign that you’re approaching an ooze lair.</p>

<p>In addition to the no doubt large variety of natural species, these things are
also quite likely to form as the result of botched magical experiments, or to
spontaneously form in piles of magical waste. They’re even easy to <em>summon</em>, so
your PCs might end up fighting them when they go up against the sort of wizard
who’s into that.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Oozes are Natural Beasts of varying size, with the Blind and Ooze keywords. They
always have some sort of blindsight or tremorsense they use to perceive their
surroundings.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault adds an <strong>Ooze</strong> trait that all of its versions have, which
allows them to ignore all penalties for squeezing. Normally, while a character
squeezes past an opening smaller than themselves, they move at half speed, grant
combat advantage, and attack at a -5 penalty. Oozes ignore all of that. I think
the Ooze keyword implies the same rules for the MM oozes, it’s just less
explicit.</p>

<h3 id="ochre-jelly-both">Ochre Jelly (Both)</h3>

<p>This Large ooze is a Level 3 Elite Brute with 102 HP and 5 acid resistance. It
crawls at speed 4, and the MV also gives it a climb speed of 4.</p>

<p>Both versions attack with pseudopod <strong>Slams</strong> that do physical damage and
ongoing acid damage (save ends). As a move action they can use <strong>Flowing Form</strong>
to shift their speed, which means they pretty much never make normal moves. I
think their Ooze trait also means they can squeeze between adventurers if the
party surrounds them but leaves a small gap.</p>

<p>When first bloodied, an ochre jelly <strong>Splits</strong> into two jellies with half the
original’s HP. So a jelly that hits exactly 51 HP would split into 25 and 26 HP
halves. Both of these individuals act independently, and the new one doesn’t
have any of the conditions that applied to the original.</p>

<p>If the fight ends with the two jellies alive (e.g., if the PCs ran away or
died), they eventually recombine.</p>

<p>A pair of ochre jellies makes a nice mini-boss fight for level 1 adventurers!
And you could easily make higher level versions that start out Huge and split
more often to challenge more powerful parties.</p>

<h3 id="green-slime-mv">Green Slime (MV)</h3>

<p>Green Slimes split the difference between a monster and a hazard, with different
editions treating them in different ways. Here, they’re monsters.</p>

<p>These green, runny slimes are Medium Level 4 Lurkers with 47 HP. They have 5
acid resistance and 5 vulnerability to both fire and radiant damage. Their basic
<strong>slams</strong> target Reflex and do 5 immediate and 5 ongoing acid damage (save
ends), which is notable because it’s a flat amount and not a damage roll.</p>

<p>They also have a special <strong>Engulf</strong> attack that also targets Reflex, does a bit
of immediate acid damage, and initiates a grab with escape DC 18. This is the 4e
version of the classic “a green slime drops on you from the ceiling” attack, so
it will likely be made with combat advantage due to surprise. Until the target
escapes the grab, they take 10 ongoing acid damage (a lot at heroic tier), and
any attacks against the slime deal half damage to the monster and half to the
victim.</p>

<p>This is not quite as bad as the “you’re dead in 1d4 rounds” of the old-school
version, but if an unlucky level 1 adventurer runs into one of these the result
will be pretty much the same.</p>

<h3 id="gelatinous-cube-both">Gelatinous Cube (Both)</h3>

<p>Ridiculous, or ridiculously awesome? These Large translucent oozes are shaped
like 10-foot cubes, fitting precisely in any Gygax-standard dungeon
corridor. They’re Level 5 Elite Brutes with 156 HP, who crawl along at a ground
or climb speed of 3.</p>

<p>In addition to the Ooze trait, they are <strong>Translucent</strong>, which makes them
invisible until they’re spotted (a DC 25 Perception check!) or until they
attack. I think it’s still true that they can’t digest metal or bone, so even if
you fail to spot the cube you might still see a floating pile of coins, a
skeleton, or a suit of armor. That’s not exactly a disadvantage: watch as the
impetuous barbarian or paladin charges the foul “construct” or “undead” and
walks right into the cube!</p>

<p>If you fail to spot the cube and walk (or charge!) into it, you’re automatically
hit by its <strong>Engulf</strong> attack and sucked into its corrosive and anesthetic
insides. This is a grab, and a grabbed victim is dazed and takes 10 ongoing acid
damage until they escape (DC 15 in the MV, 16-18 in the MM).</p>

<p>Gelatinous cubes can also be more proactive in chasing their meals! Once the
fight is joined, it will attack with <strong>Slams</strong> (Melee 1 vs. Fortitude) that deal
acid damage and immobilize (save ends), and make active Engulf attempts (Melee 1
vs. Reflex).</p>

<p>Gelatinous cubes are still exactly as much fun as they were in older
editions. Aside from the corridor, “pile of treasure” or “skeleton” setups, you
can also put them at the bottom of pit traps and the like.</p>

<h3 id="black-pudding-mv">Black Pudding (MV)</h3>

<p>The top of the food chain when it comes to classic oozes. This is a Large, Level
8 Elite Brute with 218 HP and 15 acid resistance. Their ground speed is 4, their
climb speed 3.</p>

<p>Black puddings are super-aggressive. The pudding’s <strong>Slams</strong> do quite a bit of
acid damage, and the thing can shift up to its speed before or after the
attack. They’re more like lunges than slams.</p>

<p>The pudding can also <strong>engulf</strong> (close blast 3 vs. Fortitude), which does the
same damage as a slam to everyone in the area and grabs them (DC 16). The
pudding can them use a standard action to <strong>melt</strong> one of its grabbed victims,
dealing a nice chunk of automatic acid damage and eating a healing surge. If the
victim has no healing surges left, they take 10 extra acid damage instead.</p>

<p>Defense-wise, black puddings are less of a puzzle monster than they used to be,
but they still retain some of that in their <strong>Split</strong> trait. When they’re hit by
a weapon attack, a piece of them splits off and becomes a Black Pudding Spawn in
an adjacent square.</p>

<p>Spawn are Medium Level 8 Minion Brutes whose slams have the same “shift your
speed” rider as their parent’s and do minion-level acid damage. There is <em>no
limit</em> to how many spawns may be in play at any given time, so the party is
going to be in for a nasty surprise if they have a Twin Strike ranger or are
all-martial.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Being dumber than even mundane insects, oozes don’t “ally” with anyone. Still,
some creatures might keep them in a convenient corner of their lair to deter
intruders, or they might join an ongoing fight as opportunistic predators. And
of course, as the lore text said you can have a wizard with Pokemon trainer
aspirations summon oozes and direct them through magic.</p>

<p>The sample encounter covers the first case: level 3, 1 ochre jelly and 3 orc
raiders.</p>

<p>This is another instance where you lose nothing by ignoring the Monster Manual
entries and going all in on the Vault’s versions. They have almost the full set
of classic oozes, and despite the many attempts by 3e to prove otherwise,
they’re enough for the vast majority of campaigns. It’s not D&amp;D if it doesn’t
have some icky goo in it somewhere.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Oni are inspired by Japanese mythology and have been in the game since the
beginning. However I believe this is the first time in official D&amp;D history in
which they’ve been called by this name. Before, they were known as “ogre
mages”. Here, they are only in the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>If I recall correctly, the name “oni” translates roughly into “ogre”! The
portrayal of oni in Japanese mythology varies depending on which story you’re
hearing. Some are just big dumb brutes best represented by the standard ogres we
just looked at. Others are still big, but they’re also smart and capable of
sinister sorceries. This is the type represented by this entry.</p>

<p>4th Edition oni look a lot like their mythological counterparts, and a bit like
ogres, though the two species are not related. Despite their great size and
strength, oni are clever and prefer subtle tactics to advance their own goals
and hurt their enemies. Most of them know how to assume illusory disguises and
turn themselves to mist, in addition to a repertoire of other spells and rituals
that match their preferred tactics.</p>

<p>The typical oni sees itself as a mighty lord deserving of respect, and is quite
vengeful to anyone whom it sees as not giving it that respect. Oni measure their
status by the wealth they’ve accumulated, along with the number and quality of
the slaves they own. They build hidden strongholds to live in and surround
themselves with all manner of luxury, and go out to enact their plans and/or
inflicting suffering on the surrounding population.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Oni are Large Natural Humanoids, proving that “Natural” doesn’t mean
“Mundane”. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 8, and a flight speed of 8
(clumsy).</p>

<p>They also have a couple of signature powers: <strong>Deceptive Veil</strong> allows them to
take the form of any Large <em>or Medium</em> humanoid. Piercing the disguise is an
opposed Insight vs. Bluff roll, and Oni tend to be good at Bluff. <strong>Gaseous
Form</strong> allows them to become insubstantial mist with a flight speed of 8
(hover), but since it requires standard actions to sustain they can’t do
anything but move around while in this form. It’s useful for escaping, or for
sneaking up to the PCs prior to the fight starting.</p>

<h3 id="oni-night-haunter">Oni Night Haunter</h3>

<p>This is a Level 8 Elite Controller with 180 HP, and it’s ironically a bit of an
exception to the typical oni portraited in the lore section. Night Haunters live
in small huts or caves, disguising themselves as elderly hermits. At night, they
fly out to sneak into villages and towns and devour sleeping victims.</p>

<p>They don’t just eat the flesh of those victims either! When faced with an
unconscious victim, the night haunter can use <strong>Devour Soul</strong> (melee 1
vs. Will)! A hit deals psychic damage, heals the oni for 10 HP, and <em>doesn’t</em>
wake the victim up.</p>

<p>If its enemies are awake, it can try to put them to sleep with its <strong>Hypnotic
Breath</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Will; recharges when first bloodied). This does no
damage, but dazes on a hit (save ends). After the first failed save this worsens
to unconsciousness, and then it’s Devour Soul time.</p>

<p>If its enemies stubbornly refuse to sleep, then the oni has to resort to its
Reach 2 <strong>Morningstar</strong> and bash their heads in. When it looks like it will
lose the fight, it likely uses Gaseous Form to escape.</p>

<h3 id="oni-mage">Oni Mage</h3>

<p>According to the book, these are often and mistakenly called “ogre mages” by
ignorant mortals, which means they’re the classic model.</p>

<p>Oni mages are Level 10 Elite Lurkers with 172 HP. They wear mail, so their
ground speed is only 7, but their flight speed remains the same.</p>

<p>In addition to Deceptive Veil, oni mages can become <strong>invisible</strong> at-will as a
standard action, which lasts until they attack. They deal extra “sneak attack”
damage on melee attacks when they have combat advantage.</p>

<p>Before engaging in melee, though, they’ll likely fire off a few attack spells:
<strong>Freezing Blast</strong> (close blast 5 vs Fortitude; recharge 6) does cold damage and
slows (save ends); and <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> (area 2 within 10 vs. Reflex;
recharge 5-6) does lightning damage with no riders.</p>

<p>When they finally engage in melee, they’ll use finely crafted <strong>Greatswords</strong>
for those sneak attacks while they wait for their spells to recharge.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounters each feature one oni and a variety of other angry
humanoids like ogres, orcs and trolls, which illustrate well who it is that the
oni usually enslave. Depending on the individual in question, they might do it
through overt conquest, or by disguising themselves as an ogre or orc and taking
over the tribe that way. As accomplished mages, oni might also be surrounded by
summoned creatures or other more exotic monsters.</p>

<p>I like oni! They work well as fairytale horrors despite their Natural origin,
and are smart enough to be used in situations where the party is forced to
negotiate with them. They’re one more type of monster that might be in
possession of a secret or ritual the PCs need to avert a worse evil.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they do need an update. Like all mid- or high- level MM elites,
they need a damage boost and something equivalent to the ability to make two
basic melee attacks per action. I’d also increase the mage’s sneak attack damage
to something more than a piddly 1d6, and probably make it apply to the spells as
well.</p>

<p>Ogres have been a part of D&amp;D since its beginnings, when they were the bridge
between the Humanoid and Giant power ladders. Here, they are present in both
books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Ogres are big, dumb, strong, and mean. So much so that there’s probably the
picture of an ogre near all of these words in your typical Nerathian
dictionary. They famously can’t count to ten even with all their fingers in
front of them, and their greatest technological achievement is wearing the skin
of their last meal as a loincloth so they can appear in official D&amp;D
illustrations.</p>

<p>Ogres live alone or in small nomadic bands. In both cases they settle into a
region, eat all available food, and move on. They don’t build complicated
shelters, instead using natural ones like caves and such. Ogres will hunt and
forage if they have to, but they always prefer to raid caravans or villages if
those are nearby. In combat, they use improvised weapons that allow them to
employ their great strength, such as tree clubs and big rocks.</p>

<p>You might be thinking this sounds a bit similar to the description for hill
giants that we already covered, and you’d be right. The main differences between
them is that hill giants are bigger, smarter, less bestial-looking and more
technologically developed, in a neolithic vs. paleolithic way. Hill giants have
some agriculture and built villages/steadings of their own. It also feels like
it’s easier to parley with hill giants than with ogres.</p>

<p>Despite their strength, ogres are easily recruited into service by monsters who
are more powerful or more numerous than them. This usually happens through a
combination of intimidation and food bribes. Ogres can be found working as shock
troops for orc or gnoll bands, or as auxiliaries and menial labor for hags,
dragons, and giants. Some of these patrons provide their ogre lackeys with
combat training and improved weapons, making them more dangerous. Smarter ogres
willingly seek out the mercenary life, working for money and arranging that
improved gear and training by their own initiative.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The traditional role of ogres in older editions of D&amp;D is as the star of a
“not-quite-boss” fight. Something that’s really hard for beginning adventurers
to face, but which they can defeat once they gain some XP and their players
become a bit savvier. Maybe you put them near the stairs to the second dungeon
level, or guarding some prime loot in a corner of the goblin lair or kobold
warren. When fighting ogres became easy for a group, they knew they had made it
out of the junior leagues. With some thought given to encounter design, it’s
still possible to have ogres in these roles.</p>

<p>Ogres are Large Natural Humanoids. The Monster Vault also gives them the Giant
keyword, in which is surely a callback to early D&amp;D. They move at Speed 8, and
seem to not be very compatible with magic of any kind: all the ogre varieties in
both books fight exclusively with physical attacks.</p>

<p>There’s quite a few varieties. The MM clusters them around the late heroic and
early paragon tier, the MV widens that band a little. I’ll look at them roughly
on the order of level, but pairing equivalent monsters from both books where
appropriate. When an ogre has equivalent versions in both books, the Monster
Vault version is usually the better one, so it gets more attention.</p>

<p>All ogres presented here are Chaotic Evil and speak only Giant, though the MM
says they might know a few words of Common such as “mine!”, “hungry!” and
“kill!”.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-mv">Ogre (MV)</h3>

<p>Ogres are the quintessential brutes, and this is the quintessential ogre. A
Level 6 Brute with 90 HP and Int 4, it wields a Reach 2 <strong>greatclub</strong> in melee
and throws big <strong>rocks</strong> at up to range 10.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the ogre can perform a <strong>Grand Slam</strong>, which does double the
damage of a normal club attack and <del>yeets</del> pushes the target 2 squares on a
hit.</p>

<p>A pair of these might fulfill the classic ogre role of “not-quite-boss fight”
for a level 1 or 2 party. Their ranged attacks make them more dangerous than old
D&amp;D ogres, though, since the party can’t just snipe at them with impunity.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-savage-mm">Ogre Savage (MM)</h3>

<p>This is Monster Manual’s take on old D&amp;D ogre. This one is a Level 8 Brute with
111 HP and the same <strong>greatclub</strong> as its MV successor. However it has no ranged
attacks, and its special melee attack is an <strong>Angry Smash</strong> (recharge 6) that
allows it to make two attack rolls and take the best result.</p>

<p>Despite being 2 levels stronger than the Vault ogre, the vagaries of the early
math make this one have the same attack bonus and damage. The only difference in
their basic stats are the 21 extra HP and defenses 1 point higher. You can still
have that not-quite-boss fight using the Ogre Savage as written, only you might
want to use one of them backed up by a troupe of weaker minions. Their lack of
ranged attacks might mitigate their extra power depending on your party
composition.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-hunter-mv">Ogre Hunter (MV)</h3>

<p>This one is a little more sophisticated, though that’s not saying much since it
still has Int 4. It’s a Level 7 Skirmisher with 84 HP.</p>

<p>The ogre hunter uses a one-handed Reach 2 <strong>club</strong> as its main melee weapon, and
carries a brace of stone-tipped <strong>javelins</strong> for fighting at range (Ranged
20). It’s <strong>Hurling Charge</strong> technique (recharge 4-6) allows it to throw a
javelin and make a charge if that hits.</p>

<p>If surrounded, the hunter can <strong>Clear the Ground</strong> by stomping really hard
(Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude; Minor Action), which pushes everyone it hits 2
squares. If anyone is hit by this attack, the ogre can move its speed. Who would
have thought the words “agile” and “highly mobile” would ever apply to an ogre?</p>

<h3 id="ogre-skirmisher-mm">Ogre Skirmisher (MM)</h3>

<p>Aside from being level 8 with 91 HP, this is pretty much the same monster as the
Ogre Hunter above. Its damage is lower due to the math bug, Hurling Charge is an
encounter power that always allows two attacks, and it lacks Clear the
Ground. It also has a <strong>Skirmish</strong> trait that gives it a damage bonus on any
turn where it moves more than 4 squares. I think it’s safe to say it has been
entirely superseded by the MV Hunter.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-mercenary-mv">Ogre Mercenary (MV)</h3>

<p>One of those smarter ogres who works for gold. This one is a Level 8 Soldier
with 93 HP and an Int of 7. It fights in melee with a Reach 2 <strong>morningstar</strong>
that marks for a turn on a hit, and throws Range 10 <strong>handaxes</strong> to fight from
afar.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on a single target with the morningstar, the Mercenary can
use a <strong>Brutal Sweep</strong> to attack everyone in a Close Blast 2, dealing a bit less
damage but knocking prone on a hit. This is an at-will attack! Alternating both
attacks makes the mercenary quite good at keeping the party busy.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-warhulk-mm">Ogre Warhulk (MM)</h3>

<p>A level 11 Elite Brute with 286 HP, the Warhulk is otherwise equivalent to the
Mercenary above. Its <strong>flail</strong> basic attack knocks prone instead of marking, and
the Brutal Sweep equivalent is an encounter power that otherwise works the same.</p>

<p>This results in a lackluster elite, since it only has one attack per round. If
you need an elite ogre, use an upgraded version of the Mercenary above.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-juggernaut-mv">Ogre Juggernaut (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 10 Brute with 131 HP, representing a larger and stronger ogre
than the basic level 6 version. It’s still Large as far as the rules are
concerned, though.</p>

<p>Ogre juggernauts have the same attacks as their smaller cousins, a <strong>greatclub</strong>
and <strong>rocks</strong>, which do more damage due to their higher level. Their signature
move is the <strong>Juggernaut Push</strong> (Melee 1 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6). If this
hits, the juggernaut knocks the target prone, pushes them 1 square, and shifts
to occupy the vacated square. They can then <em>keep</em> repeating the push-and-shift
loop until they have shifted their whole speed! They can stop early if that’s
not practical, but for every square they push the target beyond the first they
do 1d8 damage do it!</p>

<p>7d8 damage is in line with a level 10 “limited use attack”, but it looks extra
impressive because that’s a lot of dice <em>and</em> your PC just got kicked all over
the battlefield like a soccer ball.</p>

<h3 id="ogre-minions-mm">Ogre Minions (MM)</h3>

<p>When fighting an ogre becomes easy, you’ve left the junior leagues. When you
routinely face hordes of them, you’ve joined the major ones. Ogre minions come
in two varieties: level 11 Ogre Thugs and level 16 Ogre Bludgeoneers. Both use
their considerable bulk to pad out the forces of onis, hags, and other powerful
paragon-tier bosses. Aside from the level difference, they’re identical.</p>

<p>I’m tempted to make “Bludgeoneers” an official unit name for a bunch of ogre
minions. Like Mouseketeers, but with more violence.</p>

<h3 id="arena-trained-ogre-mv">Arena-Trained Ogre (MV)</h3>

<p>If you take a typical ogre and train them for a few years at the blood-sport
arenas of the Black Eagle Barony, this is what you get.</p>

<p>These ogres are Level 14 Brutes with 173 HP and an Int score of 8. They wield
<strong>greataxes</strong> in combat, and aside from their beefy basic attack they can often
make <strong>Vorpal Sweeps</strong> (Close Burst 2; enemies only; recharge 6) that do a bit
less damage to each target and deal ongoing 10 damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Simple, but effective. And while this isn’t stated in their stat blocks, those 4
extra points of Int mean this ogre is much more capable of understanding tactics
and effectively coordinating with its teammates.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounters in the Monster Manual are rather typical:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 1 ogre savage, 1 orc eye of Gruumsh, 8 orc warriors, 2 dire boars. An
ogre working as a heavy for an orc party.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 1 ogre warhulk, 2 ogre savages, 2 ogre skirmishers. And this is a
typical “small ogre band”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ogres are one of those monsters which I have a hard time finding
sympathetic. They’re the embodiment of a particular type of crass cruelty and
they fill that role well, even better than hill giants IMO.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if your main cultural reference for ogres is Shrek then it’s
perfectly possible to make them more sympathetic along those lines. While I like
the default presentation I wouldn’t mind seeing them in that light either. Just
keep those Pathfinder ogres away from my game.</p>

<p>Mechanically the Monster Vault stat blocks are better and you should use them if
possible. If you can’t, updating the damage of the MM ogres and giving the
Warhulk a second attack (or making it a regular instead of an elite) should make
them workable enough. Ogre stat blocks can also be used to represent younger or
weaker hill giants, like they were in the classic Against the Giants adventures.</p>
