  <figcaption>
    Ulruun, a bald and beardless dwarf in a fancy tunic. He's smiling
    repugnantly.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’re fresh out of Sorcerer-Kings, but there are still a couple of randos to
read through.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Ulruun used to be a skilled gladiator who managed to survive the arenas of
Nibenay for many years, a rarity. He eventually won his freedom, not for his
victories, but as a reward for murdering someone for his patron.</p>

<p>The dwarf then proceeded to become a living example of the cycle of abuse as he
went on to become a slave auctioneer for House Shom, and to run his own slave
trading operation on the side. The money he earned from both activities made him
wealthy, and finally allowed to achieve the luxurious life of debauchery he so
envied in the people who had forced him to risk his life for entertainment.</p>

<p>His epithet, “the Repugnant”, is not someone people call him to his face, but it
still describes his demeanor very well. He always travels with plenty of
bodyguards in case a competitor or the “merchandise” decides to take a swipe at
him, and has been known to take shelter behind lines of chained prisoners and
other innocents when attacked. If pressed, he can still rely on his arena
skills - that walking stick is mostly for show.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Ulruun is a Level 8 Soldier with 89 HP. As a dwarf, he has a ground speed of 5,
+5 to saves against poison, low-light vision, and the same <strong>Stand the Ground</strong>
and <strong>Steady-Footed</strong> traits PCs get. These reduced forced movement inflicted on
him by 1 and allow him to roll a save to avoid falling prone.</p>

<p>Ulruun’s main weapon is a <strong>Dagger</strong> whose basic attacks damage and mark for a
turn, and which can be used in a <strong>Hamstring</strong> maneuver that deals the same
damage and causes the target to fall prone if they move more than half their
speed before the end of their next turn. If a marked enemy tries to shift away
from him, he can use Hamstring on them as an interrupt.</p>

<p>If his pursuers are too insistent he can surprise them with a <strong>Hurled Cane</strong>
(minor, ranged 5), which targets Reflex and on a hit knocks prone and
immobilizes for a turn. This is an encounter power, as he only has one cane on
him.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Ulruun prefers his obvious bodyguards to be very large and intimidating, so he
tends to recruit goliaths and muls to the role. He also has more discreet humans
and halfling guards hidden in nearby crowds when walking through the city. And
if there are any innocents on the map when a fight breaks out, he’ll use them as
cover as well.</p>

<p>Ulruun is, well, repugnant, though other than being a dwarf there’s probably not
much that’s unique about him. I think he’s meant to be a typical example of a
sleazy slave trader.</p>

        </h1>

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Tectuktitlay is the king of Draj, and while he is not the only sorcerer-king to
claim to be a god, he’s apparently the one most willing to enforce that claim.</p>

<p>His priests tell the story of how he’s the son of the moons Ral and Guthay, who
descended into the mortal realm already a god. This divine family gave Draj the
gifts of bountiful harvests and prowess in battle, and can easily revoke them
if they’re not properly worshiped.</p>

<p>Disagreeing with Tectuktitlay about any of this is a particularly painful form
of suicide. He constantly appears to his people at the top of his
stepped-pyramid palace (the “Temple of the Father and Master”), and his vigilant
gaze is etched on structures all through Draj. It’s hard to tell whether his
subjects believe he’s really a god - they have gotten extremely good at going
through the motions of worshiping him in the name of self-preservation.</p>

<p>I honestly couldn’t tell from the book’s description if Tectuktitlay really
believes in his own divinity. Whether he does or not, he also knows he’s the
weakest of the Sorcerer Kings, and probably has something of an inferiority
complex about it. He tries to compensate for his personal weakness by making his
realm military strong instead.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three stat blocks here. Draj is the Aztec-themed domain, so everyone here
just loves to rip out people’s hearts.</p>

<h3 id="moon-priest">Moon Priest</h3>

<p>This is a typical templar of Draj, equal parts bureaucrat and enforcer of his
god’s creed. They’re always on the lookout for heresy, and ready to violently
punish it.</p>

<p>Moon Priests are Level 11 Controllers with the Leader tag and 110 HP. Their
leaderly qualities come from their aura of <strong>Enforced Zeal</strong> (1) which gives
allies inside a +2 damage bonus; and from <strong>Blood Demands Blood</strong> an encounter
power that gives allies within 5 squares a +2 attack bonus as a reaction when
the priest is first bloodied.</p>

<p>They fight with a <strong>Scourge</strong> that damages and inflicts a -2 attack penalty for
a turn. They also have a dagger in hand that has a scarier purpose: the <strong>Worthy
Sacrifice</strong> maneuver (melee 1 vs. Reflex), which knocks a target prone on a hit
and lets them make a secondary attack against the same target. If <em>that</em> hits,
it deals heavy physical damage, dazes (save ends), and gives 10 temporary HP to
each nonminion ally the priest can see. They try to rip your heart out! And this
is at-will.</p>

<p>They can use a minor action to charm an enemy with a <strong>Sacrificial
Summons</strong> (ranged 15 vs. Will) which pulls 5 squares and makes the target grant
combat advantage for a turn. If this ends up with the target in melee reach,
it’s that much easier to hit them with the big sacrifice attack.</p>

<h3 id="jasuan-temple-guard">Jasuan Temple Guard</h3>

<p>These are elite bodyguards hand-picked from Draj’s knightly orders for their
unquestioning devotion to their god. They protect the Father and Master Temple,
and Tectuktitlay himself. They’re Level 21 Soldiers with 200 HP.</p>

<p>They fight with <strong>Obsidian Broadswords</strong> that deal immediate and ongoing
physical damage, and also mark (save ends both). And they can throw <strong>Bone
Harpoons</strong> that deal physical damage and immobilize (save ends). Once a target
has been immobilized, they can be targeted by <strong>Reel In</strong> (minor, ranged 10
vs. Fort), which pulls them 5 squares or knocks them prone on a hit. If they end
up adjacent to the guard, the guard can hit them with his sword again.</p>

<p>Finally, their <strong>Wicked Cruelty</strong> gives them 10 temporary HP whenever they
bloody an enemy for the first time, and it’s the first time that enemy has been
bloodied in the fight.</p>

<h3 id="tectuktitlay-sorcerer-king">Tectuktitlay, Sorcerer-King</h3>

<p>Tectuktitlay is Level 22 Elite Artillery (Leader), lower level than any other of
the sorcerer-kings we saw so far in this book. He has 316 HP and a speed of 6.</p>

<p>Tectuktitlay projects a large aura of <strong>Imposed Zealotry</strong> (4) that gives a +2
attack bonus to allies inside, and another one of <strong>Bloody Vigor</strong> over the same
area that heals 10 HP to any bloodied ally that starts their turn inside.</p>

<p>He has a <strong>dagger</strong> for melee, but the real star of the show here are his
spells, all of which have a maximum range of 20. <strong>Arrows of the Two Moons</strong>
deals necrotic + radiant damage, the most unexpected combination I’ve ever
seen. <strong>Spear of the Sky</strong> is a selective area attack that deals fire +
lightning damage, and <strong>Double Attack</strong> lets him use both spells in the same
action.</p>

<p><strong>Kiss of the Two Moons</strong> is his limited-use special, firing off two separate
bolts at different targets. The first does necrotic damage and weakens (save
ends); the second does radiant damage and blinds (save ends). A miss on either
attack deals half damage and inflicts the associated condition for a turn. This
recharges when he’s first bloodied.</p>

<p>Last but not least there’s <strong>Thief of Hearts</strong> (vs. Fort, recharge 5+), in which
he attempts to teleport someone’s heart to his hand. A hit deals damage equal to
the target’s healing surge value, and hit or miss the target is dazed (save
ends).</p>

<p>If Tectuktitlay is hit with a melee or ranged attack, he can order an
<strong>Involuntary Sacrifice</strong> as an interrupt, choosing an ally within 4
squares. That ally shifts to be adjacent to his master, and is hit by the attack
instead of him.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Tectuktitlay wants to stay 20 squares away from the PCs and bombard them with
spells. His at-wills are annoying enough, but what will really light a fire
under the PCs to end him as soon as possible is when Thief of Hearts lands for
the first time. I initially read it as dealing damage equal to the target’s
<em>bloodied</em> value, but even if the actual damage is just half that, the
psychological impact is still high.</p>

<p>The party will want to get into melee with him as soon as possible, as he has no
protection against opportunity attacks, but that will be made harder by the
small army of jasuan guards and maybe up-leveled priests that will also be
there. They’ll get in the way, and their king can pull them in to take hits in
his stead.</p>

<p>The next best thing is to inflict dazes or stuns on him, since he lacks
protection against those aside from the usual elite save bonus.</p>

        </h1>

  <figcaption>
    Nibenay, in his true half-draconic form, lounging on his throne.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Yes, he named his city after himself.</p>

<p>Nibenay seems to be a very academically-minded Sorcerer-King, which is evident
in how his transformation seems to be the furthest along among the living ones,
but he’s also kinda lazy. For about two thousand years now, he’s been holed up
in his palace-temple complex of Naggaramakam enjoying a life of luxury and study
while his priesthood took care of all those boring “running the kingdom” tasks.</p>

<p>His priesthood are also his templars, which are all women and all his wives. So
this might explain why Dregoth outpaced him 1700 years ago - Nibenay still has
his vices.</p>

<p>Nibebay’s highest ranking templars are known as the High Consorts. There are
five of them, each in charge of one of the city-state’s temples. The Shadow
King’s inner circle is composed of these five, plus his personal arcane
assistants, his half-monster son Dhojakt, and a group of elite goliath
warriors. Only they can enter Naggaramakam and interact directly with their
king. And only they know what Nibenay’s true draconic form looks like - he
disguises himself as a human in his rare public appearances.</p>

<p>Things might have continued this way forever if it wasn’t for Kalak’s
assassination and the liberation of Tyr. This kind of lit a fire under Nibenay,
and he decided to end his isolation and take a more active hand in the ruling of
his domain. This has nearly all Nibenese nobles and a large number of
lower-ranking templars in a panic because they’ve been up to a lot of
self-enriching shenanigans that they were sure their king would never notice or
care about. There’s a lot of unpleasant purges in the city’s immediate future.</p>

<p>Still, Nibenay hasn’t completely abandoned his research. He seems to be
particularly interested in Athas’ distant past, and is rumored to be looking for
a way to “bring about a new Age”. That probably involves some sort of
large-scale environmental engineering, though it’s unlikely to be beneficial to
the inhabitants.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three different stat blocks here, which we’ll see in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="shadow-bride">Shadow Bride</h3>

<p>This is one of Nibenay’s lower-ranking templars. The city’s nobles tend to look
down on them and use them as pawns in their own schemes - the name “Shadow
Bride” is something of an insult. The brides resent them for this, and do
whatever dirty deeds they need in order to claw some wealth and influence for
themselves and climb the ranks of their organization.</p>

<p>This Shadow Bride is a Level 13 Soldier with 130 HP and Speed 6. She fights with
an <strong>Obsidian Short Sword</strong> in melee, and with <strong>Shadow Bolts</strong> at range that do
light cold+necrotic damage. She can inflict the <strong>Curse of the Shadow King</strong> an
adjacent enemy with a minor action. This marks the enemy until the end of the
encounter and makes it grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>Marked enemies within 6 squares who decide to ignore the mark can be targeted
with <strong>Nibenay’s Retribution</strong> as an interrupt - the bride teleports to a square
adjacent to the enemy and makes a very accurate attack vs. their Fortitude,
dealing fire+necrotic damage on a hit.</p>

<p>In her own turns the bride can also <strong>Demand Penitence</strong> (recharge 5+),
targetting up to two marked enemies in a Close Burst 5, dealing psychic damage,
pulling them 4 squares, and knocking them prone.</p>

<p>Yup, this is a Soldier Warlock. Not a combination you see every day. The
“eldritch blast” equivalent here is distinctly secondary. She wants to bring
enemies into melee range and keep them there.</p>

<h3 id="high-consort">High Consort</h3>

<p>One of the five highest ranked priestess-wives of Nibenay, part of his inner
circle. Just like the city’s nobles, they jockey for position amongst
themselves, constantly engaging in backstabbing and intrigue, though they <em>are</em>
loyal to their hubby and will fight at his side against meddling PCs who manage
to get that far. They will also fight to the end to protect their own
temples. In any other situation, they run away when the fight turns against
them.</p>

<p>High Consorts are Level 27 Artillery with 192 HP, Speed 6 and Low-Light
Vision. They fight with <strong>Obsidian Spears</strong> in melee and with <strong>Shadow Blasts</strong>
at range 20. These deal cold+necrotic damage.</p>

<p>Their special spell is <strong>Cage of Shadows</strong> (ranged 10), which deals heavy force
damage and immobilizes (save ends). It recharges when they’re bloodied. They can
also practice <strong>Arcane Defiling</strong> whenever they miss with this power or with a
Shadow Blast while allies are present within 2 squares of them. This is a free
action that inflicts 10 necrotic damage on each such ally, and lets the consort
reroll the attack.</p>

<p>If they get surrounded, consorts can use <strong>Nibenay’s Gift</strong> (recharge 5+) as a
minor action, dealing 15 cold+necrotic damage to each adjacent enemy,
teleporting 6 squares, and gaining concealment for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="nibenay-sorcerer-king">Nibenay, Sorcerer-King</h3>

<p>Nibenay in his true form is a Large Natural Humanoid, and a Level 29 Elite
Controller with 532 HP. He has ground and teleport speeds of 6 and Darkvision.</p>

<p>His <strong>Sorcerer King’s Guile</strong> is going to ruin the day of many a PC fighter, as
it makes him not provoke opportunity attacks from making ranged and area
attacks.</p>

<p>In melee, he fights with Reach 2 <strong>Dragon’s Talons</strong>, which damage and restrain
(save ends). At range, he uses the classic <strong>Ego Whip</strong> (range 10), which deals
psychic damage and dazes (save ends). Yes, it’s at-will, and <strong>Ego Storm</strong> lets
him use it twice in the same action.</p>

<p>Less often, he can use <strong>Defiling Burst</strong> (recharge 5+), which automatically
deals 15 necrotic damage to each adjacent enemy and lets Nibenay attack an Area
Burst 2 within 10 to deal necrotic damage.</p>

<p>The text is a bit strange here, as it says Nibenay gains +1 to the burst’s
attack roll for each enemy damaged by it. I guess you roll once, count the hits,
add the bonus, and keep repeating the last two steps until he either runs out of
targets or misses someone.</p>

<p>As a minor action he can creaze a <strong>Zone of Shadows</strong> that lasts for a turn and
blocks line of sight for everyone except himself. Enemies inside are
blinded. The power recharges when the zone vanishes.</p>

<p>His version of <strong>Arcane Defiling</strong> triggers when he hits and deals damage with
either of his basic attacks. It inflicts 10 necrotic damage on each enemy within
2 squares and weakens the target of the triggering attack for a turn. It’s a
<em>free action</em>, not a reaction or interrupt, so this happens every single time he
hits with Dragon Talon or Ego Whip.</p>

<p><strong>Nibenay’s Demand</strong> is his anti-stunlock power, a reaction that lets him
inflict 10 necrotic damage on an enemy within 5 squares and roll a save whenever
he’s subject to an effect a save can end.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Nibenay being an Elite instead of a Solo is not necessarily a sign that he’s
weak, but that the final fight against him will be a crowded affair. Any
surviving high consorts will surely be here, as will any other epic level
assistants and guards the GM wants to add to make the battle a worthy challenge.</p>

<p>Unlike Andropinis, Nibenay doesn’t have powers that boost or benefit from his
allies, but at least he doesn’t get in their way either - his area attack is
selective. The High Consorts, however, <em>are</em> likely to step on each others’ toes
because their version of Arcane Defiling targets allies instead of enemies.</p>

    Mearedes in her jungle home.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Mearedes is a goliath druid, the self-appointed Sentinel of Shault. Shault, in
turn, is a hidden island paradise in the Sea of Silt, one of the greenest areas
remaining in the Tyr Region, largely thanks to the efforts of Mearedes and her
disciples.</p>

<p>Those disciples are the giants Shakka and Shola, and the dwarf Hippolexes. They,
their master, and a few volunteers from the local stone and beast giant
communities intercept any strangers making landfall on Shault, and demand they
subject themselves to a ritual that prevents them from ever speaking about the
island to others. Those who refuse are killed. As you might imagine, very few
people ever return from Shault, and those who do aren’t saying anything about
it.</p>

<p>Though Mearedes has an age-lined face, she’s still as spry as a young goliath,
and has received the respectful title of “Little Grandmother” from the local
giants. Those who help her and her friends fight off threats to Shault will find
her to be a stalwart ally.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Mearedes, as mentioned, is a Goliath. She’s also a Level 18 Controller with 176
HP, Speed 6, and a lot of Classic Druid Powers, which might look very exotic to
typical Athasian characters.</p>

<p>She fights in melee with a <strong>Thorny Staff</strong> that damages and slows for a turn;
and at range with <strong>Flame Seeds</strong> that deal fire damage, and inflict 5 fire
damage on any enemy that enters one of the squares adjacent to the target or
starts their turn there before the end of her next turn. This means <em>the target</em>
can take this additional damage if they try to move.</p>

<p>And then there’s the expected <strong>Lashing Vines</strong> (recharge 6+), a fireball-sized
area attack that damages and then creates a zone of hazardous difficult terrain
that lasts for the rest of the encounter. It damages and slows those caught
inside. Yes, this is a recharge power, so the battlemap will become rougher and
rougher as time goes on.</p>

<p>As a minor action, Mearedes can assume the <strong>Form of the Ghost Panther</strong> for a
turn and shift 3 squares. In this form, she cannot attack but gains +4 Speed,
insubstantial, and phasing. She can end this as a free action or sustain it for
another turn as a minor action. And she also has the Goliath <strong>Stone’s
Endurance</strong> encounter power, which lets her gain Resistance 10 to all damage for
a turn.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Mearedes will almost always be accompanied by her three apprentices (whose stats
are left as an exercise for the reader) and by as many stone and beast giants
you need to make the fight interesting. She’s also clearly meant to be more of
an ally than an enemy here, so she or some of her apprentices could also tag
along with the group for a short while.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Maetan is the current head of House Lubar, one of Urik’s wealthiest noble
houses. He’s been prepared for leadership since childhood, though his time came
much sooner than expected due to the untimely death of his parents.</p>

<p>The house makes its fortunes through commerce and through the ownership of many
profitable fields outside of Urik’s walls. The work on those is performed by
slaves, and their administration by junior house members. Senior leadership like
Maetan has loftier concerns.</p>

<p>Maetan, for example, is busy petitioning Hamanu for the opportunity to lead a
large army against the recently freed city of Tyr, as he has a story of success
against Urik’s smaller enemies and wishes to attain new heights of glory and
favor with the sorcerer-king.</p>

<p>This probably relates to the 2e Prism Pentad adventures, which saw the PCs take
part in a battle against Urik’s forces. If this happens in your 4e campaign,
Maetan will likely be at the head of those forces.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Maetan Lubar is a human, and a Level 16 Elite Controller with 302 HP. He fights
using a combination of the fencing skills and psychic powers taught to him from
a tender age.</p>

<p>The fencing is distinctly second fiddle here: just a basic <strong>Longsword</strong> attack
that does level-appropriate damage with no riders. Maetan wants to stay a bit
outside of melee range and use his many psychic abilities instead. He’s a
telepath, so all of his powers target Will.</p>

<p><strong>Serpent’s Kiss</strong> is a range 20 basic attack that targets up to 2 creatures,
deals psychic damage and makes the target grant combat advantage for a
turn. <strong>Insidious Worm</strong> is an at-will range 10 attack that can only be used
against targets granting him combat advantage; it deals psychic damage and
forces the target to make a melee basic attack against another target of
Maetan’s choice. His usual routine would involve alternating these two.</p>

<p><strong>Coils of Lubar</strong> is an area 1 within 10 attack that deals psychic damage and
restrains (save ends). It deals 10 psychic damage as an aftereffect of the
save. It recharges when he uses <strong>Psionic Augment</strong>, a power that triggers when
Maetan hits with one of his two ranged at-wills and further boosts their
damage. And this, in turn, recharges when he’s first bloodied.</p>

<p>His two final powers are <strong>Psionic Intrusion</strong>, a minor action ranged attack
that dominates on a hit (save ends). This recharges when he’s first
bloodied. And the <strong>Mind Fog</strong> encounter power, which triggers when he’s hit by
a melee attack, affects a Close Burst 3, deals psychic damage on a hit, and
forces the targets to treat him as invisible (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I guess this might be a typical example of an evil noble type. The book says
Maetan will always be accompanied by a sizable honor guard, and in a fight he
will try to use his powers to make things easier for those guards (all of them
are selective, so he has no risk of hitting his allies). It also says that
despite all of his psionic might, Maetan is still very proud and overconfident
of his sword skills, so he might end up letting a PC get too close to him
because of this.</p>
