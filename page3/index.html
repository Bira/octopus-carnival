          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>There are a number of tropes that are specific to Cyberpunk-the-game<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but
which many people end up thinking are integral to cyberpunk-the-genre. And
“cyberpsychosis” is the one that annoys me the most by far.</p>

<p>Cyberpsychosis is Cyberpunk’s term for the general concept that cybernetic
implants make you less human. This concept made the way into the game because
its author Mike Pondsmith used the AD Police anime as one of his sources of
inspiration, and the anime goes heavily into it.</p>

<p>You probably already know how it works in the game, but here’s a refresher:
characters have an Empathy stat that determines how well they relate to other
people. This gives them a Humanity score that’s equal to Empathy x 10. Each
implant has a “Humanity cost” that gets deducted from that score when installed,
and for every 10 points of Humanity you lose you also lose 1 Empathy. This makes
it harder to succeed at social tasks. When both Humanity and Empathy reach 0,
you become a “cyberpsycho” and an NPC.</p>

<p>I agree with the <em>mechanical</em> purpose of these rules, which is to limit how much
cyberware a character can have. But this is heavily entangled with the “this
stuff makes you less human” story concept, from the terms used to the in-fiction
justification to the setting elements built around it.</p>

<p>Cyberpunk 2020 was particularly bad about this. Cyberpunk RED is much better
about it due to thirty years of progress in popular thinking about mental
health, but I still have issues with it.</p>

<h2 id="in-which-i-talk-about-my-issues">In Which I Talk About My Issues</h2>

<p>In CP RED, Humanity loss is more or less equated with psychological trauma. You
can lose Humanity by experiencing traumatic events, and modifications that are
purely cosmetic or therapeutic in nature don’t cost Humanity. Therapy helps you
recover and restores your Humanity. And I’m happy to report it’s “merely”
difficult and expensive instead of the sinister tracker-injecting conspiracy it
was in CP 2020.</p>

<p>However, the mechanics remain exactly the same as before for cyberware that has
game benefits. The explanation given is that the act of “going beyond the human
baseline” is traumatic. Cyberpsychosis is the dissociative disorder you get when
you do it too much, and makes you start seeing yourself and others as
collections of replaceable parts instead of living, thinking beings. You can use
therapy to partially recover the Humanity lost to cyberware, but to recover
those final points, you need to get rid of the implants.</p>

<p>The concept of “human baseline” isn’t examined very deeply here. You know it
when you see it, and your Empathy reduces when you move away from it. It’s the
act of implantation that causes harm.</p>

<p>This feels really backward to me, because a theme I often see in literature or
media I like is that cybernetic implants are more like the <em>scars</em> of trauma
than its <em>cause</em>.</p>

<p>Molly Millions from Neuromancer has implanted mirrorshades because her traumatic
past made her wary of opening herself up emotionally. The windows to her soul
are shuttered.</p>

<p>Burton and his ex-Haptic Recon buddies from The Peripheral have a number of
twitchy combat implants that mostly serve as symbols for the PTSD they got from
their time at war. Flynne, one of the main protagonists, has similar
psychological scars from her time playing realistic military simulations for
money, but she has no implants because her trauma comes through in her viewpoint
narration.</p>

<p>David Martinez from Edgerunners was already a reckless putz with a hero
complex<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> before getting his first implant. Each one he has installed is
either a reminder of someone he feels he failed to protect, or a reflection of
his desire to be strong enough to protect those who are left.</p>

<p>I’ve heard it said that someone who gets an implanted gun or blade is declaring
themselves the kind of person who needs to be ready to kill someone at all
times, and that erodes their humanity. But isn’t “feels the need to be ready to
fight and kill at all times” a common trait to all Cyberpunk PCs, chromed or
not? It’s a lot easier to find a PC with no implants than one with no weapons,
armor, or combat skills.</p>

<p>It doesn’t really matter whether your gun is inside your coat or inside your
arm. And since I don’t think a Cyberpunk character should lose Humanity for
carrying a conventional gun, they also shouldn’t lose it for carrying an
implanted one<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="what-id-do-instead">What I’d Do Instead</h2>

<p>Like I said above, I still agree that there must be some sort of rule limiting
the amount of cyberware Cyberpunk PCs can get. A lot of it gives powerful
abilities and you don’t want them to be able to install the whole catalog at
once. That would make the game less fun in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>I want to base it on some stat other than Empathy, though, and I’m going to pick
Body for that. I find it much easier to imagine that cyberware has concrete
impacts on your body than on your mind.</p>

<p>Under this new rule, your maximum Cyberware Capacity (CC) is your natural Body
x 10. “Natural” here means the base stat value before any modifications from
cyberware. Cyberware’s “humanity loss” stat now represents its “capacity cost”
instead. Your current Cyberware Capacity is the cost of all your implants added
together. This represents both minor health issues caused by the implant’s
presence and the increased need for maintenance.</p>

<p>If you exceed your maximum Cyberware Capacity, you die. The good news is there
are no other game penalties until you get to that point. Note that medical exams
to measure your CC values are standard pre-op procedures even at mall clinics.
No ethical ripperdoc will ever agree to perform an operation that would kill the
patient. Not all of them are ethical, though.</p>

<p>Body-scultping (including full gender transition), medical-grade replacements,
and cosmetic mods continue to have zero cost<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. The implants involved in all
of these processes are designed to be minimally invasive and to require
near-zero maintenance.</p>

<h3 id="cyberware-maintenance-optional">Cyberware Maintenance (Optional)</h3>

<p>GMs who wish to make a commentary on the cruelty of capitalism might institute
this optional rule.</p>

<p>When it’s in effect, you need to pay a monthly cyberware maintenance cost equal
to your current CC x 10eb. This represents anything from periodic check-ups and
implant cleaning to a regime of targeted immunosuppressors at the high end.</p>

<p>If you skip a month, your current CC increases by 1d6. If you’re also living
under harsh and unsanitary conditions during that time, such as from being lost
in the desert or having to sleep in the gutter, it increases by 2d6 instead. If
it goes over your maximum, you die as above. And yeah, this extra CC also
increases your maintenance costs next month. Field-expedient maintenance and a
Medicine roll might reduce the increase from 2d6 to 1d6, at the GM’s discretion,
but there’s no reducing it to zero without making that monthly payment.</p>

<p>Excess CC from neglected maintenance can be removed through treatments that cost
and work the same as the psychological therapies from page 229 of the core book:
500eb (or 100eb and a DV15 Medicine roll) to restore 2d6, and 1000eb (or 500eb
and a DV17 Medicine roll) to restore 4d6. These consist of extensive drug
courses, therapeutic surgery, and physical rehabilitation.</p>

<p>As a further optional rule, the GM could also use these stats for “tune-up”
treatments to reduce Cyberware Capacity to the minimum values described in the
book: 2 per piece of cyberware, 4 per piece of borgware. Gotta spend money to
save money.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-humanity">What About Humanity?</h2>

<p>Empathy and Humanity continue to exist in a game where Cyberware Capacity rules
are in play. Since we’re renaming things anyway, let’s rename Humanity to
Stability because suffering from mental trauma doesn’t make you less human
either.</p>

<p>You can still suffer Stability and Empathy loss when you suffer actual mental
trauma, as described in the CP RED core book. The same therapy options are still
available and they can help you as described there. Reaching 0 EMP will cause a
breakdown that will leave the character unplayable until they can recover, but
this will not necessarily be violent.</p>

<p>The one case where cyberware still causes Stability loss is when a victim is
<em>forcibly implanted</em>. The Maelstrom gang in CP 2077 loves doing that to random
civilians, and it definitely qualifies as a traumatic experience. In that case,
recovering from the trauma follows all standard core book rules, including the
one where you need to remove the offending implants for a complete recovery.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-cyberpsychosis">What About Cyberpsychosis?</h2>

<p>Again we follow CP 2077’s example here. Cyberpsychosis is a myth, a label
without any science behind it that gets thrown around by corps and media as an
easy explanation for a number of tragedies. Corporate strike team shoots an
activist, well, that was a cyberpsycho who had it coming.</p>

<p>People can have real mental breakdowns, and these can get ugly when the victim
has a predisposition towards violence and a few combat implants and/or some
weapons on hand.</p>

<p>However, violent breakdowns are never <em>caused</em> by implants. They’re always a
consequence of the inherently traumatic nature of life in the shit future of
Cyberpunk. I bet a lot of “cyberpsychos” turn out to have very few or even no
implants. Just easy access to guns and no access to mental healthcare.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/10/23/neverwinter-evernight.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: Evernight Overview</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Evernight is Neverwinter’s reflection on the Shadowfell, but it’s also a city in
its own right, inhabited by a large number of undead and undead-adjacent people
(cultists, necromancers, and the like). This book doesn’t go too deep into its
history, but it does give me the impression Evernight has existed for a long
time. It was probably described in a previous edition when the Shadowfell was
called “the plane of Shadow”.</p>

<p>Evernight is ruled by a Tribunal composed by its most influent citizens, all of
whom are ghouls and ghasts who worship Orcus and his exarch Dorensain. The
Tribunal makes the laws and settles disputes. It does the latter by deciding who
is right and eating the loser.</p>

<p>The city is very dangerous for living mortals who aren’t citizens, though it’s a
bit <em>less</em> dangerous than you’d think. Only its vampire and ghoul inhabitants
feel the need to feed on the living, and since the ambient energies of the
Shadowfell help sustain them this happens much less often than it would in the
world. Mortals and undead alike can apply for citizenship. Mortal citizens gain
legal protection from random attacks on the street, though they should probably
keep their token of citizenship within easy reach at all times. Living merchants
who pass through the city on the way to other locations can also acquire tokens
of safe passage.</p>

<p>The legal status of a mortal who doesn’t have any of that can best be summed up
as “fresh meat”, but even that isn’t an automatic death sentence. Undead who see
the living brazenly walking down the streets of Evernight tend to assume they
belong there, and will only challenge that assumption if given reason to be
suspicious. Such as when the “tourists” make horrified faces at the deeply
fucked up stuff that happens in the city’s routine unlife.</p>

<p>There are no official portals between Evernight and Neverwinter, but the planar
membrane separating the two is awfully thin and becomes fully permeable in
certain places known as “dusk crevices”. These crossings link a place in
Evernight to its corresponding worldly location, which is always in dim light or
darkness. Some are fixed, some temporary or mobile. They’re the true cause of
most spooky stories about disappearances in Neverwinter since before the
Spellplague. Mortals who fall through these crevices into Evernight make up a
significant portion of the diet of its ghoul and vampire population.</p>

<p>Despite its (literally!) ghoulish culture and society, Evernight is a major
Shadowfell trade hub, so it often sees passing caravans that link it to other
settlements in the plane. One of the trade routes passing through here is the
Shadowfell Road, a mystical path that has a ritual component. It only exists if
approached and traversed in a very specific way. The Thayans use it to supply
the Dread Ring, and the Tribunal allows them to use it for that purpose because
the Thayans pay them in <em>people</em>. A similar arrangement allows the Netherese to
maintain an embassy in the city and use their own share of trade and supply
routes.</p>

<p>Part of the reason the Tribunal accepts these deals is that both factions
represent powerful nations who are very adept at necromancy, but the ghouls
still draw the line at permitting hostilities within city limits. Evernight is
neutral territory, and violating this edict is one of the things that would
cause the Tribunal to take drastic action against the rule-breaker. In practice
that means conflict within the city takes the form of sordid spy stories of
intrigue and assassination.</p>

<p>The city did suffer some changes during the cataclysm. A reflection of the
Chasm, known locally as the Demon Pit, opened up in the corresponding Shadowfell
coordinates. And while the eruption of mount Hotenow was a quick affair in the
world, its shadowy counterpart continues to expel a slow and steady stream of
lava that flows through the equivalent of the Neverwinter River’s bed. Sometimes
you can see crew-less ghost ships sailing the lava, docking in abandoned piers,
and leaving after a few days. All of the other horrific stuff we’ll see in the
following posts was already there before that.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Evernight comes as a bit of a surprise to me, since I think it was only
mentioned in one place in the book before this section and that mention didn’t
hint at the full scope of the thing. I’m guessing old FR hands already know all
about it, though.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Here we cover the lower strata of Gauntlgrym, where the place’s greatest dangers
live.</p>

<h2 id="duergar-mines">Duergar Mines</h2>

<p>The duergar of Gauntlgrym live in this sector, which lies deeper than most of
Gauntlgrym. The book says they’ve been here for “a few generations”, which is a
lot longer than I thought before even if these are human generations. Their
situation, however, still matches: they’ve taken over old mining tunnels and dug
new ones under the direction of their leader Kholzourl.</p>

<p>They’ve unearthed several veins of useful metal, including iron, silver, mithral
and hellthorn (the one that likes infernal enchantments). Their work is
ceaseless, grueling, and mostly done by slaves, which they replenish by
capturing any non-duergar they lay eyes on down here. Tunnels built by the
original dwarves show their characteristic sloped walls and tend to be both safe
and clean. Duergar tunnels are slapdash and hazardous, sometimes nearly vertical
due to their leader’s need to go ever deeper. Some of these shafts are so deep
that they contain semi-permanent work camps where duergar and enslaved workers
live instead of going back to the city at the end of every day.</p>

<p>The duergar don’t care about the big mithral gates. They got here from below,
via tunnels that link their camps to the deep Underdark. Some of these tunnels
have since been taken over by plaguechanged mind flayers, which are as much a
cause of injury and death as the work itself.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the mines is also a temple to Asmodeus built from desecrated
material taken from the Iron Tabernacle, which Kholzourl uses to commune with
his god and summon the occasional devil.</p>

<p>And why exactly are the duergar so intent on digging ever deeper? Only Kholzourl
and the GM really now. The book gives us several possible reasons - GMs can
either pick one or use them as inspiration for a bespoke sinister plot.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hellthorn comes from a meteorite that fell here in primeval times, and the
main body of the thing contains far more power than the mere shards that have
been found so far. Maybe it contains an alien diabolic entity, millions of
years old, waiting for the moment when it is found and awakened.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The duergar want to drain the magma from Maegera’s resting place and transport
her slumbering form to some place where she can wake up and destroy an enemy
of Asmodeus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mining is just a cover and their actual goal is to observe the mind
flayers and track down their aboleth masters. The duergar suspect they want to
open a permanent portal to the Far Realm and want to hijack the procedure so
the portal leads to Hell instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or maybe the interaction of all the different types of bad magic that bathe
this region (infernal, aberrant, necromantic, oh my!) has created something
terrible underground that they wish to claim for themselves.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-fiery-pit">The Fiery Pit</h2>

<p>The lowest halls of Gauntlgrym are occupied by this enormous lake of magma, at
the center of which spins a white-hot whirlpool that marks Maegera’s resting
place.</p>

<p>The prison devised by the ancient mages if Illusk used bound water elementals
fed by a continuous stream of sea water pumped here by magical means. The system
could only be turned off by a true heir of Delzoun. The cataclysm happened when
Valindra found one to pull the lever, causing Maegera to nearly awaken. Drizzt
and his buddies prevented a full awakening back then, but the partial one was
still enough to ruin Neverwinter.</p>

<p>Unfortunately one of the channels had been destroyed, and so was not reactivated
when the rest of them were. This caused the binding to become imperfect and to
slowly fade over time. Now Maegera is dangerously close to another awakening.</p>

<p>Maegera is meant to be used as a looming threat - the bad guys want to wake her,
the PCs want to stop that from happening. PCs could fix the broken arcane pump
by using the notes found in the Waterclock Crypt in Neverwinter, which would
make the whole thing stable once more.</p>

<p>Unless of course the Heir of Delzoun PC is foolish enough to pull the “off”
switch again, causing another cataclysm. Then the whole Sword Coast is due for a
TPK.</p>

<h2 id="the-great-forge">The Great Forge</h2>

<p>In addition to the water elemental-based restraints, the structure around
Maegera also contains a complex network of pipes and wires made from all sorts
of enchanted and rune-carved metal, from copper to adamantine. These act as
conduits for the primordial’s power, which was siphoned to this sector of the
city.</p>

<p>The heat arrived at a great adamantine pyramid known as the Burning Heart, which
collected it and distributed it to the various forges and manufactories in the
sector. This heat could melt through any metal in short order, making it
extremely easy to shape and ensuring the resulting products would carry a little
of Maegera’s power with them.</p>

<p>PCs investigating the Forge can find remains of an ancient battle here, and will
find with the appropriate skill tests that the bones of the invading force
belong to legion devils.</p>

<p>The Heart itself can also be investigated by characters competent in
Arcana. Beating a DC of 11 reveals the obvious (lots of fire magic!); beating a
16 reveals this fire magic is being moderated by water magic; and beating a 23
reveals that the energy is being drained by a third party (the aboleths, which
use it in their research).</p>

<p>“Normal” areas of the Forge are subject to the Unearthly Heat terrain effect,
and since Maegera is partially unbound some terrain here can display more
overtly supernatural fire features.</p>

<p>Breaching one of the conduits from the Heart or the Forge will bathe the
offending character in primordial fire magic, making them resistant to fire and
better at using fire attacks, but vulnerable to and worse at using some other
element of the GM’s choice. Also, they get a bonus to Diplomacy with elemental
creatures and a corresponding penalty when dealing with immortal ones.</p>

<p>The character loses three healing surges when this happens, and it wasn’t clear
to me whether they could be recovered normally. The mutations are permanent
until cured by Remove Affliction or an equivalent power. A cure removes all
effects - there’s no way to keep just the beneficial ones!</p>

<h2 id="the-deepest-depths">The Deepest Depths</h2>

<p>This is the part of Gauntlgrym that connects to the Underdark. The duergar
originally came in through here, but the place has since become very
inhospitable even to them. Many species of aberrant creature dwell in these dark
passages, chief among them the plaguechanged mind flayers that are giving the
duergar trouble. Their mission is to prevent anyone from messing with Maegera,
and thus from getting in the way of the AbSov’s remote experiment with her.</p>

<p>This means they fight the duergar, but they aren’t any less evil than their
foes. Like most Underdark villains mind flayers are fond of slavery, and they
keep their captives here as well.</p>

<p>This region is also where the dwarves built secure vaults to store a variety of
horrors they found in their delves. Most are still secure, but some have been
opened over the centuries. One of the vaults that are already open is the one
that housed the original population of dire corbies, and which has become their
largest nest. They keep a lot of treasure there that no other faction has
managed to claim yet.</p>

<p>Beneath even this, you get into tunnels that aren’t part of Gauntlgrym, and
which snake their way downwards to the Underdark. Whatever is down there is out
of scope of the campaign. It could perhaps be an interesting segue into Paragon
Tier when the PCs do finish it, should the group be willing.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>The areas detailed in this post have a definite “endgame” feeling. Whatever your
reasons for coming to Gauntlgrym, if you’re here you’ll need to deal with the
mess of adversarial factions described in this post, finish what Drizzt and
company could not, and make sure Maegera stays asleep.</p>

<p>This would be a fitting end to a campaign centered on the Heirs of Delzoun, but
others might go from here to the bottom of the Chasm as they follow the clues
left by the mind flayers to their real masters.</p>

<p>Conversely, if the group doesn’t include any heirs or anyone else who’d be
interested in the lost city, Gauntlgrym can be safely and entirely removed from
the campaign. Just say that Maegera is in no danger of waking up, and focus on
those elements that are relevant to your players.</p>

            <p>This part gives an overview of the fabled lost city of Gauntlgrym,and goes into
detail about its “upper” strata.</p>

<h2 id="historical-errata">Historical Errata</h2>

<p>There’s another bit I missed when I glossed over the big-ass timeline at the
beginning of the book, and now I must correct that here.</p>

<p>The dwarves of Gauntlgrym found the primordial Maegera early in their habitation
of the city, but they left her sealed up for a few hundred years before messing
with her.</p>

<p>The massive project that bound her into a sort of arcane power generator was a
three-way joint project between the dwarves, the mages of Illusk and the elves
of Iliyanbruen. As we saw in the post about Shandarar, they were still around
for a few centuries after the fall of Netheril, so they took part in this as
well. The book describes this as a positive example of what the three peoples
can do when they work together, though it outlived their friendship.</p>

<p>Maegera’s power allowed the dwarves of Delzoun to create inumerable wonders, in
the form of both potent magical items and marvelous works of infrastructure for
their capital and their empire. Gauntlgrym became a big center of trade and even
saw numerous human families moving there.</p>

<p>The reason it fell was because of the Orc Marches, a massive region-wide
invasion by an army of orcs larger than any seen before or since. By the time
this happened, the three peoples were no longer on speaking terms, as each had
grown more arrogant and mistrustful over time. They could have banded together
to repel the invasion, but each thought they could go it alone. Illusk fell
first, and Delzoun was next, and only at the gates of Shandarar was the
already-weakened orc army repelled.</p>

<p>Iliyanbruen would end up dismantling anyway when it tried to take the fight to
the orcs in Illusk, as we saw earlier. Gauntlgrym was left alone since no one
seemed to be coming up from there. Its dwarven and humans refugees scattered all
over the Realms, with many of the humans joining Uthgardt tribes on the surface
and the dwarves ranging out further to move to their surviving nations.</p>

<p>The empire of Delzoun and its capital of Gauntlgrym are today kinda like the
dwarven equivalent of the Roman Empire in that stupid meme. No dwarf living
today has ever laid eyes on the lost city, but they think of it regularly and
describe it as the height of their civilization.</p>

<h2 id="gauntlgrym-today">Gauntlgrym Today</h2>

<p>Despite being lost to the surface, Gauntlgrym did not remain static in all these
millennia. The orcs were kicked out by mind flayers; the mind flayers by derro;
and the derro by duergar. That last one happened fairly recently in historical
terms, so the duergar still consider themselves masters of the place. However,
they are not the only people living there. There are other groups seeking to
control the city, and literal multitudes of ghosts belonging to its original
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the city from the outside in.</p>

<h3 id="the-great-cavern">The Great Cavern</h3>

<p>Whatever paths to Gauntlgrym exist in your campaign, they will always end
here. This is a massive natural cavern filled with alien Underdark vegetation
and labyrinthine formations of stone pillars and stalagmites. Small forts and
balconies are carved into the walls and around the largest pillars - the remains
of former guard posts. The bones of ancient battles litter the floor.</p>

<p>There’s a small lake at the center of the cave, and on one of its walls stands
the massive mithral gate that leads into Gauntlgrym proper. It’s nearly
impossible to open by mundane or magical means, but a true heir of Delzoun can
open it with the slightest push. The cave is filled with your preferred
selection of Underdark monsters, and also with two sapient factions.</p>

<p>The first is a group of old Ashmadai who came here with Valindra when she first
tried to free the primordial in that Drizzt novel. The tunnels they used filled
with magma at the end of that, so they became trapped here. Their first reaction
to any strangers they spot is violence, though some of them might be prepared to
surrender or betray the rest in exchange for a way back to the surface.</p>

<p>The second faction is the House Xorlarrin expedition, who arrived recently and
built a hidden camp. They’re spying on the Ashmadai while looking for a way to
open the gates. Their reaction to intruding PCs will be to remain hidden and spy
on them as well, waiting to see if they can open the gates. If they can, the
drow will follow them covertly, scattering if spotted, and will only attack if
the PCs become distracted by some other enemy inside the city.</p>

<h3 id="the-iron-tabernacle">The Iron Tabernacle</h3>

<p>The Iron Tabernacle was Gauntlgrym’s temple district, and was both the city’s
physical and spiritual center. Its many temples and shrines were dedicated to
Moradin and other good gods, and attended by a sizable contingent of dwarven and
human priests. This enormous multi-leveled district was a marvelous sight to
behold in its glory days, but now most of it lies ravaged by both time and by
duergar impiety. The city’s new occupants have defaced every religious image and
statue they could find, and stolen anything of value here, from precious relics
to the mithral trim in the walls.</p>

<p>Still, the Tabernacle is so vast that some hidden shrines remain untouched and
could be reconsecrated by PCs. There’s a text box here detailing the minor boons
they can gain from doing so. An extended rest next to the restored shrine takes
only three hours instead of six, and has no danger of being interrupted by
wandering monsters. And if a member of the party is a non-evil dwarf or a
worshiper of Moradin, they might gain the attention of one of the city’s ghosts,
who will help them in battle the next time they fight (using a level-appropriate
incorporeal undead stat block). Both benefits only happen once.</p>

<p>The Tabernacle is also the hub of Gaunglgrym’s ancient mine rail network. The
rails connect directly or indirectly to every other district in the city, and
are meant to be traveled by self-propelled mine carts that were used for bulk
cargo transport back in the day. They still run according to their ancient
schedules and could be commandeered by PCs. A big switching station in the
Tabernacle can let them switch carts from one track to another. It’s an easy
way to get around this vast city.</p>

<p>Or perhaps not so easy - there are some rules here that might come into play
when a fight happens during a cart ride, or when a cart <em>derails</em> during a
fight.</p>

<h3 id="ancient-cemetery">Ancient Cemetery</h3>

<p>The lowest level of the Tabernacle is a massive collection of crypts, laid out
according to a now forgotten scheme or tradition. Some are simple, some very
elaborate, but all of them have the names, titles, and lineage of their
occupants carved on their stone.</p>

<p>Unlike the upper levels, the crypts are intact. The many, many ghosts who roam
the place attack any would-be vandals and thieves en masse, so the duergar stay
away from here.</p>

<p>The ghosts will not bother the PCs at first, but will attack as above if they
try to damage or steal from the crypts. The group should take care to remain on
their best behavior while in this area.</p>

<h2 id="theme-tie-ins-and-impressions">Theme Tie-Ins and Impressions</h2>

<p>The PC theme that’s most interested in Gauntlgrym is definitely the Heir of
Delzoun. Finding this place is their life’s goal, so if your party includes one
or more Heirs Gauntlgrym is going to be a vitally important place for the
campaign.</p>

<p>For the Heir and most other characters who might be interested in finding the
city, the true treasure here is all the historical and genealogical information
contained in the crypt walls. It’s a major archaeological finding all by itself,
which is reason enough for Oghma’s Faithful, but it’s even more valuable to the
Heir and perhaps even to the Neverwinter Noble. All dwarves, and a lot of human
nobles, keep pretty detailed genealogies of their own clans and families and
these would be easy to connect to the ones in display here.</p>

<p>If the Noble could prove that their house is older than Neverwinter itself, then
they might have an unassailable claim to the throne! And if the Heir’s ancestors
are important enough, they might have a strong claim to <em>Gauntlgrym’s</em> throne,
or perhaps to that of one of its successor states.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone would be happy with these findings. There are plenty of
dwarven nobles out there who built their prestige on forged lineages, and who
would not want the world to discover this fact. And many others who would be
more than happy to pull a Beloq and kill the PCs before they can announce their
findings to the world, so that they can claim the credit.</p>

<p>The “default” way to arrive at Gauntlgrym is to navigate the river of flame
beneath Mount Hotenow, but there could be other paths as well. Maybe they could
take a detour through Hotenow’s Shadowfell reflection, or maybe there’s a
mystical path similar to Shadowfell Road that takes those who follow it properly
to the mithral gates.</p>

<p>In the next post, we dig too greedily and too deep.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/10/10/coiled-spring.html">The Coiled Spring</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<p>The Coiled Spring is an amulet made of brass. It’s disc shaped and about an inch
thick. On its front, there is a relief of a snake eating its own tail, the
classic Ouroboros. The inside of the ring formed by the snake is a clear crystal
panel, through which can be seen a spring like that of a watch.</p>

<p>That spring can store up to ten Fatigue Points which can be used to enable
bursts of extra effort - most often <em>Extra Effort in Combat</em> (p. B357), but also
other athletic feats. The stored FP can only be used for those purposes, and is
not affected by negative effects that would sap the user’s own FP. In other
words, it works just like the Heroic Reserves advantage from <strong>GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy 20: Slayers</strong>, and <em>almost</em> like a power item for martial characters.</p>

<p>The main difference between the Coiled Spring and a normal Power Item is that it
hijacks the natural recovery processes of the wearer’s body in order to “wind”
itself, and cannot be recharged by the usual methods for power items. While the
Spring is not at full capacity, its wearer is unable to recover their own
Fatigue Points, and the amulet gains 1 FP every 10 minutes. This is a constant
rate - traits which speed up FP recovery for the wearer have no effect on the
amulet. The wearer regains their usual ability to rest when the amulet is fully
charged, or when it’s removed (which stops the charging process).</p>

<p>While this does mean recharging the Coiled Spring in town is effectively free,
it can make dungeon delving more complicated for martial characters,
particularly if the GM enforces rules like fatigue costs for fighting a battle
(p. B426 or DF Exploits p. 60). Characters who normally can’t use Fatigue Points
can wear the Coiled Spring and use it to benefit from the Extra Effort rules in
and out of combat, though they can’t recharge it.</p>

<p>Scholars who know of the Spring speculate that it was originally meant  to allow
golems and other constructs to surpass their limits. In an adventure, it will
most likely be found worn by such a construct, or by an elite warrior who
figured out it works just as well for organics. If found in a chest or hoard,
though, it will always start out empty.</p>

<p>If the delvers try to sell the Coiled Spring, or if you decide it’s available in
shops, its monetary value is twice that of a Power Item of the same
capacity. That’s $3400 for the 10 FP version described here, though you could
have versions with greater or smaller capacity. Note that you <em>can’t</em> double-dip
and use the Coiled Spring as a Power Item.</p>

<p>Variant Springs are possible. Maybe the Flywheel of Faith can power divine
magic, the Arcane Array wizardly spells, and the Goddess Gyre druidic ones. The
recharging mechanics and all other restrictions are the same. They could allow a
construct who can’t normally cast spells or use casting magical items due to a
lack of FP to do so.</p>
