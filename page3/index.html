            <p>You’d normally expect a monster book to end right after the “Zombie” entry, but
we’re only at the two-third mark on this one. We’re now entering the section on
the “Personages of Athas”.</p>

<p>The book has a really short intro for it, explaining that it takes a lot of
skill and luck to survive for long in this world, and that this is a sample of
people who managed to do exactly that and are therefore remarkable.</p>

<p>The difference between the entries in this section and the ones in the monster
section are not mechanical. As far as I can understand, every entry in this
section concerns one or more specific individuals. And while I haven’t read
every entry yet, I also suspect the book doesn’t expect them to automatically be
your enemies. They could be entirely neutral to your goals, or they might even
be potential allies. While one of these things is also often true about the
monster entries, both should be true for everyone in this section.</p>

<p>I think this is why the Dragon of Tyr was in the monster section. He is a
specific individual, but he’s also the “final boss” of Dark Sun. By default,
he’s not particularly interested in making new alliances and no PC party who
isn’t completely rotten to the core would think of allying with him for real.</p>

<p>The Sorcerer-Kings, however, <em>are</em> in the Personages section, because I imagine
PCs might want to form temporary alliances with some of them against the
others. We’ll also see a bunch of much lower level randos.</p>

<p>As I stated in an earlier post, I decided to move the Dragon’s description to
this section as I consider him to be more of a Personage than a monster. So
we’ll start with him on the next post.</p>

    This is similar to a zombie, but it seems to be a repurposed
    picture of another creature.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Zombies in Athas have the same origin as zombies in every other D&amp;D world:
they’re created either intentionally by necromancy, or accidentally from dead
bodies left for long enough in areas exposed to strong necrotic energies.</p>

<p>In Athas that means areas touched by the Gray, the Darker and Sunnier version of
the Shadowfell. Any bodies left in these places have a high chance of rising as
zombies. As the natural environment in these areas tends to be particularly
harsh as well, they can do interesting things to these bodies before they rise.</p>

<p>The most common of those is that by the time the body rises its flesh is long
gone due to the actions of predators and scouring winds, so you get a skeleton
instead. But some places like the ones named below can preserve the flesh of a
corpse, giving enough time to rise as a Darker and Sunnier Zombie with extra
powers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The zombies described in this entry are Natural Humanoids, which I think
is an error because every other zombie is a Natural Animate. In any case, they
have the Undead tag and the usual immunity to poison and disease and resistance
to necrotic damage. They also tend to be faster than standard zombie varieties
(which still exist in Athas!).</p>

<h3 id="salt-zombie">Salt Zombie</h3>

<p>These are created from the big necrotic zone in the Salt Meres. They tend to lie
beneath the salt flats, erupting out of the ground when they sense living beings
walking the surface. They probably look dried out and mummified.</p>

<p>Salt Zombies are Level 1 Soldiers with 28 HP and a ground speed of 6. Their
necrotic resistance is 5 and they have Vulnerable 5 to Radiant damage. Their
basic <strong>claws</strong> damage and grab on a hit, but their <strong>Salt Feast</strong> attack is
usually more effective: it does the same damage and also grabs, but the target
has a -4 penalty to escape the grab and takes another 5 damage every time they
fail. And of course, the zombie can also keep attacking the grabbed target
either way.</p>

<p>They also suffer from the <strong>Zombie Weakness</strong> that afflicts a lot of standard
zombies, and so are instantly destroyed when someone scores a critical hit on
them.</p>

<h3 id="black-reaver-zombies">Black Reaver Zombies</h3>

<p>There originate from the Black Sands region. Legend has it that an ancient act
of defiling magic summoned these sands into the region, and that they drained
the souls of everyone they touched. There’s a creepy deserted city at its
center, which was presumably the target of this magical WMD. Modern Athasians
tend to give it a wide berth, and anyone who dies here will probably rise as one
of these zombies.</p>

<p>Black Reavers are Level 5 Lurkers with 51 HP and a zippy ground speed
of 7. They’re blind, and so have the corresponding tag and are immune to
blinding and gaze attacks, perceiving the world through their
Blindsight 10. Their necrotic resistant is 10, and while they don’t take extra
damage from radiant damage it does prevent them from using their Shadow Burst
power for a turn, basically defanging them for that time.</p>

<p>You see, their basic <strong>bite</strong> does a relatively weak mix of physical and
necrotic damage, so they really need the extra necrotic damage from attacking a
target that couldn’t see them at the start of their turn in order to be a threat
to equivalent-level PCs. And the most likely way for them to get that bonus is
<strong>Shadow Burst</strong> (recharge 4+), a move action that lets them teleport 5 squares
and create a Burst 1 zone that blinds everyone inside around their arrival
point. This zone lasts for a turn.</p>

<p>When using these in an encounter, you might want to add plenty of
vision-blocking terrain to the battle map, like ruined buildings or big rocks. A
zombie without Shadow Burst could still get that damage bonus if it was behind
such terrain before charging out and attacking, something its high Speed would
help with. Darkness also helps, but not as much since PCs are likely to have
many options for lighting up the place.</p>

<h3 id="feasting-zombie">Feasting Zombie</h3>

<p>This one appears in the Forest Ridge where halflings live. Halflings who catch
terminal diseases are not eaten when they die, for obvious reasons. Instead,
they’re buried, which is believed to return them to nature’s embrace. This
alternate funerary practice is less effective at preventing them from rising as
zombies when conditions are right.</p>

<p>Feasting zombies are Small, since they originate from halflings, and they’re
Level 6 Minion Brutes with Speed 5. They <strong>bite</strong>, and when they die they
perform a <strong>Clamping Bite Death Chomp</strong>, which does the same damage as the bite
attack and also slows (save ends) because the dead zombie doesn’t let go until
you pry it off.</p>

<h3 id="cinder-zombies">Cinder Zombies</h3>

<p>These were killed and preserved by fire. This could be because they lived in
some of the volcanic islands in the Sea of Silt, of because their village was
torched by raiders. They’re charred instead of rotten, and therefore smell of
burned meat. They’re also quite strong.</p>

<p>Cinder Zombies are Level 12 Soldiers with 121 HP and Speed 5. They have Resist
Necrotic 15, Resist Fire 10, and Vulnerable Radiant 5. They project an aura of
<strong>Burning Embers</strong> that deal 10 fire damage to any enemy who leaves the aura,
giving them an incentive to remain close. They pummel enemies with their <strong>Fists
of Cinder</strong> that do a mix of physical and fire damage. If an enemy within their
aura makes an attack that doesn’t target them, the zombie uses <strong>Punishing
Sparks</strong> on them to deal a bit of fire damage on a hit. When the creature is
first bloodied, it releases a <strong>Choking Cloud</strong> that attacks the Fortitude of
enemies in a Close Burst 3. On a hit it deals poison damage and prevents them
from spending healing surges (save ends). On a miss it deals half damage and
prevents surge expenditure for a turn.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>While the four zombie types presented here are new, they’re still zombies. You
use them in the same way you use standard zombies which, again, exist on
Athas. I think I like the cinder zombies the most, as they have an interesting
Defender Aura-like setup and fire zombies make sense in non-Athas settings too.</p>

<p>While three of the four zombies presented here are strongly associated with
their specific home regions, there’s nothing preventing an enterprising villain
from importing them to wherever their lair is, or from somehow replicating the
process of their creation in a lab.</p>

  <figcaption>
    A wight posing in a threatening manner.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Athasian wights are, at their root, pretty much the same as standard ones:
undead whose soulless bodies are animated by a scrap of animus (or will) the
dead person left behind. However, their description here goes on to say that
wights were driven to complete some kind of mission or achieve an important goal
when they died, and the “will” that animates them is an obsession with
fulfilling that task. It also gives them an eternal hunger for life force, and
robs them of the capacity to feel anything but hatred, grief, and frustration.</p>

<p>You can technically exorcize a wight by fulfilling its task. This is extremely
difficult <em>at best</em>, and it’s often impossible. Wights are not exactly willing
to give detailed interviews about the circumstances of their death. Even if the
PCs can discover those many of the creatures have been dead for so long that all
people and places involved are simply gone. This will probably force the PCs to
resort to the second most effective anti-wight strategy: extreme violence.</p>

<p>For a wight to be truly destroyed, its body must be obliterated. A popular
tactic is to dismember and then burn their corpses. Not doing this means the
creature will restore itself and return eventually.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The Wights presented here are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead keyword,
and a bunch of traditional undead traits: Darkvision, immunity to disease and
poison, 10 resistance to necrotic damage, and and 5 or 10 vulnerability to
Radiant.</p>

<p>These wights tend to lack the default ability to eat your healing surges, but
they gain other individualized tricks in its place.</p>

<h3 id="wight-thrall">Wight Thrall</h3>

<p>These are the exception to the wight lore I described above because they’re
<em>already</em> living their best unlife. Their obsession was to serve their beloved
master for all eternity, and that’s exactly what they’re doing.</p>

<p>Wight thralls have about as much initiative as your typical zombie, but they’re
<em>much</em> better at following their master’s commands. If you find these, their
master is likely nearby, either as a more powerful wight or as some other
monster.</p>

<p>These creatures are Level 12 Minion Brutes with a speed of 7 and the standard
traits mentioned above (except radiant vulnerability). Their <strong>Claws</strong> damage
and have a life drain effect that’s modeled slightly differently: targets hit by
the attack cannot gain temporary HP at all and recover 5 less HP from healing
effects (save ends).</p>

<p>When destroyed by non-radiant damage, their <strong>Dark Passing</strong> ability restores 5
HP to a nearby undead ally.</p>

<h3 id="dune-runner-wight">Dune Runner Wight</h3>

<p>This was an elf who died trying to deliver an important message or warning to
their community. Every night they arise and try to complete the impossible run,
only to appear back at the starting point when the sun rises. During the day,
they terrorize nearby creatures to vent their frustration and slake their
thirst.</p>

<p>Dune Runner Wights are level 12 Minion Skirmishers with 124 HP and the common
traits mentioned above. Their <strong>claws</strong> have no effect beyond their decent
damage, but they deal extra damage if the runner moved at least 4 squares before
attacking, and can be used as part of a <strong>Mobile Melee Attack</strong> maneuver that
lets the runner move its speed without and attack at any point during the move
without provoking an opportunity attack from the target.</p>

<p>As a 1/round minor action, they can try to afflict someone with a <strong>Running
Curse</strong> (ranged 5 vs. Will), which forces at target to move at least 4 squares
on their turn or take a bit of psychic damage (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="oath-wight">Oath Wight</h3>

<p>These used to be inhabitants of one of Athas’ many ancient ruins, who were on
the verge of completing an important task when their entire city was leveled by
a sorcerous WMD of some kind. Maybe they were scholars nearing a research
breakthrough, maybe they were thieves about to pull that big score… or maybe
they were mothers undergoing childbirth. So there’s some nightmare fuel for
ya. They’re Level 14 Elite Controllers with 140 HP and a speed of 6.</p>

<p>Their frustration with the futility of their task is so potent it leaks out, and
can be used as a weapon. This aura of <strong>Inevitable Failure</strong> inflicts a -2
penalty to attacks, skill checks, and defenses to any non-dominated enemies
inside.</p>

<p>The wight can dominate enemies with its <strong>Accursed Gaze</strong> (minor action, ranged
5 vs. Will), which dominates for a turn on a hit. It can also use the
<strong>Frustration’s Fury</strong> encounter power, which attacks the Will of 2 nearby
targets. On a hit, it reals psychic damage and forces the target to make a free
melee basic attack (or a charge!)  against another target of the wight’s
choice. If this secondary attack <em>misses</em>, the target is dominated (save
ends). A miss with the power deals half damage and dazes for a turn.</p>

<p>When Frustration’s Fury is unavailable, the wight uses its basic <strong>Rotting
Touch</strong>, which does necrotic damage and prevents HP recovery for a turn.</p>

<p>If you were wondering why the wight has so little HP for an elite, it’s because
reaching 0 HP triggers its <strong>Promised Return</strong> power, causing it to reappear
with full HP near its last position at the start of its next turn.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The description of wights as the products of obsession that lingers beyond death
is so cool that I’m tempted to make this the default description of wights in
any game I run. The mechanics of the ones presented here are interesting and
help bring them into the paragon tier.</p>

<p>Wights might very rarely work with the living if they can convince the creature
they have similar goals, but they mostly hang out with other undead or with
predatory beasts who don’t see them as food.</p>

  <figcaption>

</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Thri-kreen are the famous mantis-people of Athas. A slightly more generic
version of them appeared in the Monster Manual 3, and now we get more NPC stat
blocks here and a playable version in the Campaign Guide. Unlike what happened
to muls a few pages back, thri-kreen in the Creature Catalog are given a
description that’s about as positive as the one for the playable version.</p>

<p>Thri-kreen have deep instinctual bonds of loyalty to their “clutch” and their
“pack”. As the Campaign Guide explains, a clutch is a small group of at most six
individuals to whom the thri-kreen feels closest, and a pack is an extended
family composed of multiple clutches.</p>

<p>Traditionally a clutch is formed by individuals who hatched from their eggs at
around the same time, but kreen can “adopt” other clutches over time if
circumstances demand. For PCs, this means their adventuring party is their
clutch. NPC kreen away from their homes will have similar arrangements with
their ally groups.</p>

<p>Those ubiquitous asshole slavers like to steal Thri-kreen eggs so that their can
exploit their bonding instinct, making them extremely loyal to their new
masters.</p>

<p>Thri-kreen packs prefer to hunt non-sapient creatures for food, but they will
make exceptions in truly desperate times. They will fight with all their
strenght to protect themselves from attacks by other people, but will almost
never be the aggressors in such fights. Their spiritual leaders are known as
desert talkers, and are responsible for maintaining their connection to the
primal spirits of the desert and those of their ancestors. This gives them a
very long genetic memory, stretching back to an ancient age where they had their
own great empire.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>These NPC thri-kreen are Medium Natural Humanoids with Low-Light Vision. The
ones here have ground speeds between 6 and 7, slightly slower than the MM3
ones. Their signature ability remains <strong>Mantis Jump</strong>, an move-action encounter
power that lets them jump their speed without provoking opportunity
attacks. This is indeed different from the power PCs get.</p>

<p>We get three new stat blocks here, which can be mixed in with the ones from the
MM3 without any extra work.</p>

<h3 id="thri-kreen-bounder">Thri-Kreen Bounder</h3>

<p>These are less experienced hunters who are still learning the tricks of the
trade by observing the pack’s veterans at work. They tend to be a little more
skittish than those veterans. They’re Level 6 Minion Skirmishers with a ground
speed of 6.</p>

<p>The <strong>Deft Dodger</strong> trait gives them +2 to defenses against ranged attacks,
which helps them survive longer in a fight. They attack in melee with <strong>claws</strong>
and at range with thrown <strong>Chatkchas</strong>, which are three-pointed throwing blades
with Range 6/12.</p>

<p>Instead of Mantis Jump they have <strong>Mantis Bound</strong>, which lets them jump 3
squares without provoking opportunity attacks as a reaction to being missed by
an attack.</p>

<h3 id="thri-kreen-mauler">Thri-Kreen Mauler</h3>

<p>These are the veteran hunters, big and beefy thri-kreen who single out a quarry,
jump on top of it, and tear it apart. They’re Level 8 Brutes with 105 HP and a
speed of 6.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>Claw</strong> attack is way too weak for a level 8 brute (average damage
9), but <strong>Mauler Frenzy</strong> (recharge 4+) lets them make two of those, three when
bloodied. <strong>Mauler Leap</strong> lets them jump 6 squares and make two claw attacks
with a +1 to attack and a +4 to damage, which definitely matches the
formula. This recharges when they’re first bloodied.</p>

<p>If the mauler hits a bloodied target with their claws, they can use <strong>Pain
Amplification</strong> against that rarget with a minor action, attacking their
Fortitude. A hit causes the target to take ongoing 5 psychic damage (save ends).</p>

<p>If multiple claw attacks aren’t on the cards this turn, the mauler can use its
<strong>Chatkchas</strong> at range, which do level-appropriate physical damage. Mantis Jump
rounds out their arsenal.</p>

<p>While Maulers will try to avoid getting killed like any opponent, they don’t
mind getting bloodied since it makes them stronger. They probably should try to
open the fight with a Leap, get stuck in for a Frenzy or two, and then jump away
for that second use of Mauler Leap once bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="thri-kreen-mantis-warrior">Thri-Kreen Mantis Warrior</h3>

<p>Mantis Warriors are hunt leaders, highly skilled with both weapons and psychic
powers. They’re Level 10 Elite Soldiers with 208 HP and a ground speed of 7.</p>

<p>They still have their <strong>Claws</strong>, and also carry a <strong>Gythka</strong>, a light polearm
with a trident-like head on either end. Both do equivalent damage, but the
gythka marks for a turn on a hit and does a blend of physical and psychic damage
instead of just physical. They can also throw <strong>Chatkchas</strong>, though these are a
bit weaker.</p>

<p>The <strong>Mantis Flurry</strong> ability allows the warrior to make a claw and a gythka
attack, or to throw two chatkchas, with a single action.</p>

<p>Occasionally they can pull off a <strong>Springing Assault</strong> (recharge 5+): this lets
them jump 4 squares, make a gythka attack, then jump another 3 and make another
gythka attack. None of this movement provokes opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can perform a <strong>Mind Wrench</strong>, attacking the Will of all
enemies in a Close Burst 2. On a hit this deals psychic damage and marks for a
turn.</p>

<p>When an adjacent marked enemy moves, shifts, or makes an attack that doesn’t
target the warrior, it can cause a <strong>Spasm</strong> as an interrupt. This is an attack
against Will that does psychic damage on a hit, knocks the target prone, and
slows them until the end of the warrior’s next turn.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These three stat blocks combined with the Ambusher, Scout, and Sand Talker from
the MM3 will let you build a large variety of thri-kreen encounters. They can
also be part of “found clutches”, AKA Mixed Groups of Humanoids, voluntarily or
not.</p>

<p>I note that the MM3 Thri-Kreen are described as using “spears” and “shuriken”,
which clearly correspond to the gythkas and chatkchas used by these ones. A
simple find-and-replace of the names should work, as there is no mechanical
difference between them in the stat blocks themselves.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was a town named Gerot at the foot of a mountain near the
city-state of Raam. Its people were great warriors, but also haugthy. When the
Sorcerer Queen Abalach-Re sent them an offer of alliance in exchange for them
joining Raam’s legions, they signaled their refusal by killing the envoys.</p>

<p>Abalach-Re was obviously very angry at this, so she double-cursed the people of
Gerot: they would be afflicted with an unquenchable thirst <em>and</em> pure water
would become like a poison to them. In short order, the entire town was
dead. The bit the queen hadn’t predicted was that the dead of Gerot would rise
again, as the first thraxes.</p>

<p>A thrax is a water vampire. Still afflicted by the sorcerous curse, it suffers
from constant, unquenchable thirst, which it tries to satisfy by draining the
fluids from the flesh of the living. Thrax victims become desiccated husks, and
it’s said to be an agonizing death.</p>

<p>Unlike a standard D&amp;D vampire, a thrax seems to retain the mind and personality
it had in life. This means they’re even more miserable, tormented not just by
their cursed thirst but also by their regret at having to feed. Prime personal
horror material there.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, we’re talking about the thraxes that seek revenge on
Abalach-Re by haunting Raam and drinking her supporters dry. I imagine those are
a fair bit less conflicted than the others.</p>

<p>Thraxes can drain fluids through skin contact, and they also have this trick
where they can cause a victim’s fluids to all move close to the skin, making the
victim bloated and easier to drain.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We only get a single stat block here, so let’s get right to it.</p>

<h3 id="thrax">Thrax</h3>

<p>The thrax shown here is Medium Natural Humanoid (undead) and a Level 11 Lurker
with 88 HP, putting it about on par with the traditional vampires from the
Monster Vault. It has darkvision, Resist 10 Necrotic, and Vulnerable 5
Radiant. Unlike a lot of other undead, it has no special resistance against
poison and disease. And unlike a traditional vampire, it is not vulnerable to
natural sunlight.</p>

<p>Thraxes are surrounded by <strong>Roiling Shadows</strong> which give them +2 to defenses
against ranged attacks, and their <strong>Clinging Grasp</strong> makes them insubstantial
and immune to forced movement while they have a creature grabbed. This takes
away the PC’s easiest tactic for making them let go.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is the <strong>Grasp of the Dead</strong>, which deals necrotic damage. If
the thrax has combat advantage, a hit also grabs the victim, which has a -5
penalty to escape rolls.</p>

<p>Once it has a creature grabbed, the thrax can proceed to <strong>Drain Fluids</strong>, which
deals heavy necrotic damage, heals the thrax for 10 HP, and ends the grab. If the
attack bloodies the target, they also fall unconscious (save ends).</p>

<p>The thrax can also attack with <strong>Flesh Bloat</strong>, the “trick” mentioned
above. This is an at-will melee attack that deals a bit more necrotic damage
than the Grasp, and also dazes and slows the target (save ends both).</p>

<p>Standard tactics for a thrax will likely be to bloat their intended victim, grab
them with Grasp of the Dead, and then Drain Fluids, repeating as necessary.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Water vampires feel much more appropriate for Dark Sun than the traditional
blood kind. I’m guessing all the traditional vampires in Athas must have melted
in the heat from all those layers they tend to wear.</p>

<p>Thraxes will probably only join up with other thraxes, and a fight against five
of them will be nightmarish for the party. You could also mix it up with other
relatively “dry” undead types. Maybe angry ghosts, or the animated corpses of
their dried-out victims.</p>
