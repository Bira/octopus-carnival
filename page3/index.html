<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This vast Harken Forest takes up the entirety of the Vale’s southern border,
and sprawls northward to completely enclose the barony of Harkenwold. It used to
be even vaster, but successive waves of settlers cut it down some, just like it
happened with the northern Winterbole forest.</p>

<p>This place is home to many creatures and dangers, though its temperate climate
means their character is very different from the frost-aspected Winterbole. This
article looks at one of its most important factions.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Vale’s first elves came to live here shortly after their people split from
the Eladrin, settling in the Harken Forest. Some of these elves grew fascinated
with the primal power of the forest, and formed a group they called Harken’s
Heart to worship and protect it.</p>

<p>Harken’s Heart differs from a typical druidic circle in that they consider
themselves to have a duty to <em>Harken Forest</em> as opposed to a more general duty
to the balance of nature. Their interpretation of what constitutes an attack on
the forest is paradoxically much broader than that of a typical druid
circle. When war broke out between the treants of Harken and Winterbole forests,
Harken’s Heart eagerly joined battle on the side of their “home team”, and
behaved in such a ruthless and violent manner during the war that it shocked the
independent druids who also lived there. In response to the circle’s behavior, a
powerful independent druid named Eyton cast a curse upon the whole circle. The
curse severed their connection to the primal spirits and left them powerless.</p>

<p>The druids of Harken’s Heart were dismayed and enraged at this, but their
weakened state and their fear of Eyton’s power prevented them from taking direct
revenge. Instead, they appealed to Melora, goddess of nature, and asked her to
restore their power.</p>

<p>The deity decided to only grant part of their request, for her own mysterious
reasons. Today, the druids of Harken’s Heart enjoy the full extent of their
power while inside the borders of the forest. This power quickly wanes and
disappears once they leave its confines.</p>

<p>In our narrative present, Harken’s Heart is made up of several hundred members,
most of which were born into the circle and raised within its culture. They live
in small camps scattered all through the forest, with some of them choosing to
live alone. Their important structures are made of trees woven together by
magic, and are hidden behind natural obstacles and features in the forest.</p>

<p>The leader of Harken’s Heart is known as The Hierophant, and is the group’s top
negotiator, judge, arbiter and policymaker. Hierophants rule for life, and
appoint their chosen successors. If one dies without a successor, the remaining
druids hold an election to choose the next Hierophant.</p>

<p>Some Harken’s Heart druids look for a way to end the curse, while others instead
look for a way to expand the boundaries of the forest. The Harken treants are
very interested in this as well, and it’s rumored that they’re planning a huge
land grab in the near future.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get several stat blocks for different types of elven druids here. As elves,
they all have low-light vision and the Wild Step ability, which lets them ignore
difficult terrain when shifting. As druids, they all have Forest Walk and can
<strong>Change Shape</strong> as a minor action take the form of a beast until they use the
power again or until they die. Some of their attacks can only be used in beast
form, some only in elf form.</p>

<h3 id="harkens-heart-acolyte">Harken’s Heart Acolyte</h3>

<p>A young elf who is still undergoing basic training, the Acolyte is a Level 7
Minion Skirmisher that already has all the common traits above. It fights with a
<strong>Quarterstaff</strong> in elf form, and with a <strong>Claw</strong> in beast form. The claw attack
is stronger and allows them to shift 1 square before or after the attack.</p>

<p>Acolytes have every reason to always fight as beasts.</p>

<h3 id="harkens-heart-druid">Harken’s Heart Druid</h3>

<p>A fully trained druid. This one’s a Level 7 Controller with 78 HP.</p>

<p>In elf form, the druid fights with a <strong>Quarterstaff</strong> and can cast a <strong>Wall of
Thorns</strong> spell. As the name implies this is one of the very few monster attacks
that uses the Wall rules. Creatures caught in the wall when it appears take some
immediate and ongoing physical damage (save ends). The wall remains as a zone
that counts as difficult terrain for creatures without Forest Walk. Any of these
who enters the zone or ends their turn there also takes 5 damage. The spell
recharges when the druid is bloodied.</p>

<p>In beast form the druid attacks with a <strong>Lunge</strong> that deals the same damage as
the quarterstaff and lets them slide the target 2 squares as an effect.</p>

<p>In either form the druid can use <strong>Entangle</strong>, a non-damaging ranged spell that
immobilizes (save ends).</p>

<p>Druids have more reason to change shape mid-fight. The beast form’s basic attack
is better, but their big spell requires them to be in humanoid form.</p>

<h3 id="harkens-heart-defender">Harken’s Heart Defender</h3>

<p>Defenders are elite druids who are the first to confront any threats to the
forest. They’re also responsible for training the acolytes. Defenders are Level
9 Soldiers with 95 HP.</p>

<p>They have a <strong>Quarterstaff</strong> basic attack when in humanoid form, but all of
their cool maneuvers happen in beast form.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Mangle</strong> basic attack damages and slows for a turn. They can use a
<strong>Primal Flurry</strong> that attacks enemies in a Close Burst 1 for the same amount of
damage and knocks them prone on a hit. If those enemies try to stand up during
their next turn, the defender gets to make a free basic attack against them. A
miss deals half damage and knocks prone without the possibility of a free
attack. This recharges once the defender is bloodied.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can use <strong>Beast’s Pursuit</strong> as a move action, shifting
their speed to a space adjacent to an enemy and gaining a +2 to hit until the
end of their current turn.</p>

<h3 id="harkens-heart-hierophant">Harken’s Heart Hierophant</h3>

<p>This entry doesn’t give a specific name and personality to the current
Hierophant, so you’re free to do that yourself to fit your current
campaign. These stats work whatever their personality is, and can also be
repurposed to represent other high-ranking Harken’s Heart druids.</p>

<p>The Hierophant is Level 10 Elite Artillery with the Leader tag and 166
HP. Unlike other druids, its best powers can only be used in humanoid form.</p>

<p>Their only basic attack is the <strong>Quarterstaff</strong>. At range they can attack with
<strong>Earth Slam</strong> spells, which deal physical damage and can knock the target prone
on a critical hit. They can also cast <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> spells (recharge 5+)
which attack an area, deal heavy lightning damage, inflict ongoing thunder
damage, and create a zone that deals lightning damage to those caught
inside. Quite powerful!</p>

<p>The beast form is reserved for when the Hierophant is surrounded and needs to
make a <strong>Frenzied Escape</strong>. This attacks enemies in a Close Burst 1, deals heavy
immediate and ongoing physical damage, and lets the druid shift its speed to a
space not adjacent to any enemies, gaining +4 to all defenses during this
movement (in order to dodge PC defender attacks).</p>

<p>Finally, the <strong>Guardian of the Forest</strong> minor action can be used in any
form. This non-damaging attack has a range of 20 squares, and on a hit it makes
the target be marked by an ally of the Hierophant that’s also within 20 squares
of it.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>A nice implementation of the classic concept of angry druids, with a
surprisingly low amount of entangling vine effects in play. They’re extremists,
so even nature-attuned PCs might get into conflict with them. The identity of
the Hierophant being left as an exercise for the reader makes it easy to play
stories where a hard-liner Hierophant gets replaced by a moderate or vice-versa,
causing a sudden switch in the circle’s campaign role.</p>

<p>The Winterbole-Harken treant war is an important setting element that will
appear here again. It affects not only the treants themselves but also factions
allied to both sides. On the Winterbole side, open war is certain to bring the
Frost Witches into the conflict, and either them or the Winterbole treants
themselves might contrive a way to bring Bitterstrike in.</p>

<p>The Gray Company are a new, setting-specific faction.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As far as history goes, the fall of Nerath is still a relatively recent
event. Many humans alive today likely have a great-grandparent who was alive
during the final days of that empire. Members of longer-lived species like
elves, dwarves and eladrin might even have witnessed those days
themselves.</p>

<p>So it’s no wonder that Nerath has it own share of revivalists who want to
rebuild it to fit the glorious image in their head. In the Nentir Vale, the most
prominent of those groups is known as the Gray Company. Many people in the Vale
consider them nothing more than a well-equipped gang of bandits, but its members
believe themselves to be working towards the rebirth of their glorious
empire. Their singular focus on this goal makes them a dour and humorless
bunch, seemingly always covered with the dust of ages even when their equipment
is new.</p>

<p>The Company is made up primarily of humans, who were the dominant people of
Nerath. It is led by one Halvath Cormarrin, a man who claims to be a scion of
Nerath’s royal line. It recruits people from across the Nentir Vale, spreading
stories of the glories of the old empire and inviting those most fascinated by
them to join up. Once a recruit joins up, they’re in for life. Deserters are
hunted down, executed by hanging, and left on display on crossroads, as the old
law dictates.</p>

<p>The Company’s HQ is located in the Gray Downs, a region thick with Nerathi ruins
and artifacts. Much of their time and effort is spent exploring these ruins and
recovering these artifacts which they consider theirs by right. Cormarrin is
particularly interested in finding old pieces of regalia like the Sword of
Nerath and the Threefold Crown, since possessing them would increase the
legitimacy of his claim.</p>

<p>Anyone who steals these objects (whether from Company itself or from the ruins
they consider their territory) is ruthlessly pursued. Particularly resourceful
thieves are invited to join up and lend their skills to the Company’s
cause. Others, including those who refuse the invitation, are executed in
manners prescribed by old Nerathi law.</p>

<p>Company members are trained, equipped and organized to the standards of the
Nerathi military, or as close as Cormarrin can manage those. This means they
also count plenty of battle mages among their number. Their magic specializes in
controlling the pervasive mist of the Gray Downs, with a large side order of
artifice (to get those recovered magic items working again) and necromancy (to
get those old fallen heroes of Nerath working again).</p>

<p>Other chapters of the Gray Company have begun appearing in other regions of the
Vale, each of them led by a self-proclaimed prince of old Nerath. If these
groups all got together under one banner, they could become a formidable army
with a real chance of achieving their goal… but they feud with each other as
much or more as they fight their actual enemies, so their overall progress
remains minimal. As some jokers say, this too is a grand Nerathi tradition.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gray Company members are all in the late Heroic Tier, meaning they haven’t quite
broken through to “regional power” status. All of the stat blocks here represent
humans, which make up the majority of their soldiers.</p>

<p>Their signature trait is <strong>Grim Solidarity</strong>. If someone with this trait starts
their turn adjacent to another creature with this trait, they can make a saving
throw against one effect that a save can end. All Company members have this,
which means they’re difficult to debuff when in formation.</p>

<h3 id="gray-company-recruit">Gray Company Recruit</h3>

<p>Recruits joined relatively recent, so their training and gear is not yet up to
the standards of the Company. They already have Grim Solidarity, though. They’re
Level 7 Minion Artillery armed with <strong>short swords</strong> and <strong>short bows</strong>. If they
score a critical hit, <strong>Inspired Fervor</strong> lets them make a free basic attack
against the same enemy with a +2 bonus to hit.</p>

<h3 id="gray-company-soldier">Gray Company Soldier</h3>

<p>A veteran who earned the right to carry a sword of genuine Nerathi make. Armored
in plate, he’s a Level 7 Soldier with 80 HP. His basic attack with that
<strong>Ancient Longsword</strong> has no riders, but whenever an adjacent enemy makes an
attack that doesn’t include the veteran as a target, he can use <strong>Strike of the
Ancient Blade</strong> to make a free sword attack against them that also pushes the
enemy and knocks it prone.</p>

<p>If an ally of the soldier drops to 0 HP within 5 squares of him, he can react
<strong>For the Glory of Old Nerath</strong> (encounter) and make an attack in a Close Burst
1 that deals more damage than a basic strike and inflicts 5 ongoing damage (save
ends).</p>

<h3 id="gray-company-fallen-hero">Gray Company Fallen Hero</h3>

<p>Either an actual Nerathi soldier whose body was exhumed and reanimated, or a
modern day Gray Company veteran who died in combat and was “re-upped” for a
second term of service. In either case, this results in a sapient undead
revenant who likely has no memory of its previous self. It’s a Level 6 Brute
with 89 HP. It has Grim Solidarity, Darkvision and the standard undead traits
(immune to poison and disease, resistant to necrotic, vulnerable to radiant).</p>

<p>The fallen hero’s <strong>Longsword</strong> deals necrotic damage and inflicts Vulnerable 5
Necrotic for a turn. It can invoke <strong>Nerath’s Vengeance</strong> to make a sword attack
against every adjacent enemy, and this recharges once it’s bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="gray-company-mist-mage">Gray Company Mist Mage</h3>

<p>Mist mages are responsible for getting those old magical items (and Fallen
Heroes) back into working order. In combat, they use spells with a cold and mist
theme, which goes well with the environment of the Gray Downs.</p>

<p>Mist mages are Level 9 Controllers with 95 HP. They have Resist Cold 5. They use
<strong>Ice Daggers</strong> in melee, which deal cold damage and slow for a turn on a
hit. They can also summon <strong>Misty Tendrils</strong> to attack enemies in a Close
Blast 3 that deals cold damage on a hit and slides 1 square as an effect.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can create a zone of <strong>Gray Mist</strong> (area 2 within 10
squares). Any creature that ends its turn in the mist takes a -2 penalty to
attacks and is slowed for a turn.</p>

<p>They can also use a <strong>Freeze Mist</strong> spell as a minor action, which targets a
slowed creature and immobilizes them for a turn on a hit.</p>

<p>Mist mages will likely start the fight by laying down Gray Mist, and then use
Misty Tendrils to herd the PCs into the zone. They will then use Freeze Mist to
keep these PCs immobilized as their buddies move in for the kill. Note that, as
controller monsters, they’re quite capable of bringing the damage themselves.</p>

<h3 id="halvath-cormarrin">Halvath Cormarrin</h3>

<p>The leader of the Gray Company is a Level 8 Elite Brute with the Leader tag and
214 HP. In addition to having Grim Solidarity, he can exhort his underlings to
fight <strong>Until the Last Breath</strong>, which acts as an Aura 5 that allows allies
inside to make one last free attack when they drop to 0 HP.</p>

<p>Cormarrin wields an <strong>Ancient Rune Flail</strong> and can make <strong>Double Attacks</strong> with
it. He can also use swing it around and have the <strong>Rune Flail’s Arc</strong> attack
everyone in a Close Burst 1. A hit deals the same damage as a basic attack,
pushes the target 1 square, and knocks it prone. A miss deals half damage and
pushes 1 square. Good move to escape being surrounded.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, Cormarrin can use <strong>Cry of Glory</strong> to turn a normal hit by
an ally within 10 squares into a critical.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Like Dythan’s Legion, the Gray Company is a faction modeled after the army of a
fallen empire whose main goal lies in the restoration of that empire. The Legion
can more than match them man-for-man, but the Company probably has more
soldiers, particularly if you tally all the different chapters together. They
might skirmish near the shores of Lake Nen.</p>

<p>Other possible sources of conflict for the Company include the Barrowhaunts, who
probably were Nerathi when alive, and also claim the Gray Downs as their
territory. Other interesting monsters also make their home there, as we’ll soon
see.</p>

<p>Ironically, if Dythan’s Legion ever decides the Gray Company is a threat that
must be eliminated, the resulting large-scale confrontation is probably going to
unite the Company’s disparate chapters around a common enemy and make that
assessment into a self-fulfilling prophecy. As it is, I’m sure many of the
Company’s “princes”, Cormarrin chief among them, would just love to hire the
Gravelstoke family to help secure their claim as the true heir to
Nerath. Whether the Family ever takes one of them up on the offer will depend on
what you want for your campaign.</p>

<p>A truly unified Gray Company would finally become the regional power they want
to be, and this might merit bumping their levels up to the Paragon tier. Do the
PCs accept this new order, or to they fight it?</p>

<p>The Gravelstokes are a new threat with very specific ties to the Nentir Vale
setting. They also serve as a reminder that Nerath wasn’t all sunshine and
roses.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Gravelstokes used to be one of the most prominent noble families in old
Nerath. They frequented the highest courts, had the ear of the royal family, and
had holdings spread through all corners of the empire. The time of strife and
backstabbing that followed the fall of Nerath’s government saw their fortunes
and household greatly diminished. Despite paying such a heavy cost to end the
family’s old rivalries, it managed to keep its deepest and darkest secret: all
of that prestige and money they had during Nerath’s heyday came from their
service to the Crown as assassins. One of the reasons they fell was because they
no longer had a benefactor to support their work.</p>

<p>Their patriarch at the time, Lord Andrew Gravelstoke, retired to his last
holdings in the remote Nentir Vale and took most of his surviving relatives with
him. There he eventually passed and left his children to squander the last of
the family fortune. All that remains is their bleak stone mansion in the Barony
of Harkenwold, and a modest summer retreat just outside of Fallcrest.</p>

<p>The current patriarch is Andrew’s grandson Xander. After decades of bickering
has managed to unite most of the family behind the singular purpose of
recovering their old prestige and fortune. And they intend to do that by taking
up the old family trade: murdering people.</p>

<p>Xander has been making contact with the family’s old business partners, former
rivals, and anyone who is in need of a spot of murder to let them know the
Gravelstokes are once again for hire. They’ve kept the old family techniques
alive and even improved on them, so the quality of their service is assured.</p>

<p>The family’s main field operatives are Xander himself, his three younger
siblings, and his son. Xander also takes counsel from his uncle Barin and his
widowed sister-in-law Lenore. His young wife Regan is attractive, demure, and
knows how to keep a secret, but doesn’t have any direct involvement in the
“business”. She’s Xander’s third wife: the first two failed to meet his approval
and suffered convenient accidents.</p>

<p>The siblings are named Mikus, Tovin, and Alesia. Mikus and Tovin are twins, and
the trio is inseparable. They go everywhere together, whether on a job or just
traveling for fun. There are dark rumors floating around about the carnality of
their relationship and its “debased offspring”, but in a surprising twist for
such a heavily Gothic Horror family, these rumors are all false. They are
however competent and ruthless assassins.</p>

<p>Xander’s son Vincent is more of a serial killer than an assassin, an anti-social
recluse who is very particular about whom he chooses to kill. Xander is at a bit
of a loss about what to do with him, since this behavior is bad for business.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get stats for all combatant Gravelstokes here. They’re all early to
mid-Paragon threats, which likely means their customers are the kind of people
who have designs on the whole of the Vale.</p>

<p>The Gravelstokes’ special training gives them several advantages over typical
humans. They all have Darkvision, and they all know their signature technique
named <strong>Stone Cold Killer</strong>.</p>

<p>Any creature killed by a Gravelstoke-trained assassin is petrified and cannot be
raised from the dead while they remain that way. The killer can end this
petrification by touching the victim and willing them restored, or someone else
can do it by sprinkling a few drops of the killer’s blood on the statue. A
restored victim is still dead, of course, but now they can be returned to life
with a Raise Dead ritual.</p>

<h3 id="vincent-gravelstoke">Vincent Gravelstoke</h3>

<p>Vincent’s tactics in a fight mirror his social behavior: he lurks at the edges
and only steps in when a good opportunity for murder presents itself. He’s a
Level 12 Lurker with 90 HP. His <strong>Poisoned Rapier</strong> does necrotic and poison
damage, and if the attack is made with combat advantage it also inflicts 10
ongoing damage (save ends).</p>

<p>He can also perform a <strong>Shadow Strike</strong>, a standard action which removes him
from play until the start of his next turn. At that time, he reappears within 10
squares of his previous position and can perform a rapier attack that deals
heavy physical damage and prevents the target from spending healing surges (save
ends). It does half damage on a miss.</p>

<p>If pressed, Vincent can <strong>Fade Into the Shadows</strong> as a minor action. This
encounter power makes him insubstantial and grants partial concealment until the
start of his next turn. The effect ends early if he attacks, or if he suffers
radiant damage.</p>

<p>Finally, Vincent’s fencing skill lets him <strong>Parry</strong> melee attacks as an at-will
interrupt that grants him +4 to all defenses against the attack.</p>

<h3 id="tovin-gravelstoke">Tovin Gravelstoke</h3>

<p>One of the twins, Tovin is a deadly sniper. He’s Level 13 Artillery with 96
HP. He wields a <strong>Crossbow of Dread</strong> whose basic attacks grant him a +4 damage
bonus against the target until the end of his next turn. Some of his bolts are
<strong>Poisoned Shot</strong> (recharge 5+), doing the same damage as the basic attack and
inflicting 10 ongoing necrotic and poison damage (save ends). The target also
becomes immobilized after the first failed save, and after the second both
effects are replaced with unconsciousness (save ends).</p>

<p>If hit in melee, Tovin can use <strong>Shadow Escape</strong> (encounter) as a reaction to
deal 5 necrotic damage to the attacker and teleport 5 squares. If he can’t
escape, he’ll fight with his <strong>Dagger of Death</strong>, whose attacks deal necrotic
damage.</p>

<h3 id="mikus-gravelstoke">Mikus Gravelstoke</h3>

<p>The other twin is much more fond of melee combat. He’s a Level 13 Soldier with
128 HP. His <strong>greatsword</strong> deals physical damage and marks for a turn. If a
marked enemy within 5 squares of Mikus makes an attack that doesn’t include him
as a target, he can use <strong>Shadow’s Curse</strong> to deal an automatic 10 necrotic
damage to them, ignoring all resistances and immunities.</p>

<p>He can also use a spell named <strong>Incite The Blood</strong>, a selective Close Burst 3
that pulls targets 2 squares towards him and lets him make a strong melee attack
against each one. In other words, it’s a goth version of Come and Get It.</p>

<h3 id="alesia-gravelstoke">Alesia Gravelstoke</h3>

<p>Alesia is a bit older than the twins, but is still their steadfast sister and
friend. She’s a Level 14 Controller with 140 HP. Her weapon of choice is a
<strong>Bewildering Chakram</strong> that can be used for both melee and ranged attacks. An
enemy hit by either takes 5 extra psychic damage for each square they move
during their next turn. When used as a thrown weapon, the chakram returns to
Alesia’s hand after the attack.</p>

<p>She can also perform a <strong>Reeling Chakram</strong> attack (recharges when first
bloodied). This does about double damage, half on a miss, and also pushes the
target 2 squares and knocks them prone as an effect. Plus she knows enough magic
to cast a <strong>Toxic Tendrils</strong> spell (Area 2 within 10, recharge 5+), which deals
necrotic and poison damage and slows (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="xander-gravelstoke">Xander Gravelstoke</h3>

<p>The patriarch of the family, and its most deadly combatant. Xander is a Level 16
Elite Skirmisher with the Leader tag and 304 HP. He wields paired short swords
in a fight. The basic <strong>sword</strong> attack deals physical damage and slides the
target 1 square. Xander can also <strong>Lunge</strong> (recharge 5+) which lets him shift up
to half his speed before the attack and deals increased damage. Both attacks
ignore 10 points of resistance, which is only likely to come up against targets
that have Resist All since what I call “physical” damage is actually untyped.</p>

<p>Once per encounter Xander can use a <strong>Shadow Step</strong> to teleport 5 squares and
gain partial concealment for a turn.</p>

<p>Xander’s minor actions are where his Leaderly and Elite-y maneuvers
are. <strong>Off-Hand Swipe</strong> lets him shift 2 squares and then make a sword attack
that deals slightly less damage than a basic one. Combining this with the basic
attack lets Xander efficiently herd PCs. Once per encounter he can use <strong>Quick
Rally</strong> to affect all allies within 3 squares. Affected allies can shift 2
squares and make a melee basic attack, though each of them must attack a
different creature.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Like the Barrowhaunts, the Gravelstokes are a party of Evil NPCs that pair very
well with each other. Having one of the PCs’ enemies hire them to kill the PCs
is the most obvious way to include them in the adventure, though there are other
ways that can be as or more fun.</p>

<p>You might, for example, add them to your campaign much earlier, still in the
early Heroic Tier, as a source of ominous foreshadowing. They do have a summer
estate in Fallcrest where they can go to pose as slightly eccentric nobles while
Xander and Uncle Barin negotiate new contracts. It’s also possible to have a
Heroic Tier murder mystery where the victim turned to stone after death. The PCs
might not be able to determine the identity of the actual killer beyond “a
mysterious hired assassin”, and then the goal becomes finding the mastermind.</p>

<p>The family is not really interested in Nerath as an ideal - they care only about
regaining their own prestige and wealth. That could happen in a reborn Nerath,
or it could happen in an empire by any other name. So they might consider any of
the “revivalist” factions as prospective clients or as deluded upstarts
depending on how deep their purses are.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This is another Vale-specific faction, and a cool one.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Winterbole forest takes up nearly the entire northern edge of the Vale. This
snowy conifer forest is home to several different factions that exist in uneasy
equilibrium, and the Frost Witches are one of the most powerful.</p>

<p>The Witches worship the primordial Cryonax, one of the Evil Elemental Princes,
but no one outside their group knows about this. To most other inhabitants of
the Vale they’re “merely” scary forest witches who manipulate and terrify others
for their own benefit.</p>

<p>The Frost Witches count elves, humans, harpies and gnomes among their
number. Every one of them knows how to use magic, and the vast majority are
female. They increase their numbers mostly through active recruiting, which
might mean kidnapping children from communities bordering the woods as often as
it means inducting consenting adults into the coven. Their leader is the elf
witch Clenderi, which rules the group with absolute authority second only to
Cryonax himself.</p>

<p>The Witches are spread out through the whole Winterbole forest, in scattered
huts housing either lone individuals or small groups of less than half a
dozen. Their central headquarters is known simply as “Cold Camp”, and it’s
important not only because it’s Clenderi’s home but also because it houses the
source of their power, an artifact known as the Cold Cauldron.</p>

<p>The Cauldron is entirely made of ice, and a frozen flame burns eternally
underneath it. Standing too close to it is hazardous to anyone who’s not a
Witch, and it causes a wide area around itself to be covered in frost.</p>

<p>The Witches have no true friends outside their own group. Any alliances they
make with others are opportunistic and likely to be temporary. They are
absolutely willing to turn on these allies if circumstances change.</p>

<p>The Tigerclaw barbarians who also live in the Winterbole forest have been burned
by this enough times that they now attempt to kill any Frost Witches they meet
on sight. The Witches are wary around their territory but don’t consider them a
serious threat. They maintain much better relations with the Winterbole treants,
and are engaging on a subtle campaign of manipulation against the dragon
Bitterstrike, intending to eventually convert her to the worship of Cryonax.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We start off with stats for the Cauldron, which will be relevant to any battle
that happens inside Cold Camp. It’s 6 feet in diameter, so you could say it’s
Large. Rules-wise it counts as an indestructible terrain feature, emitting an
aura of <strong>Icy Flames</strong> (2) that deals cold damage to any enemy of the Witches
who ends their turn inside. It also turns the terrain inside the whole of Cold
Camp into <strong>Frozen Ground</strong>, which is difficult terrain for anyone without Ice
Walk.</p>

<p>As you might expect, all stat blocks in this entry have Ice Walk and a lot of
cold magic powers, along with resistance to cold and a vulnerability to
fire. They also retain their racial traits, if any.</p>

<h3 id="icicle-swarm">Icicle Swarm</h3>

<p>This is a Medium swarm of Tiny, sharp ice elementals that the Witches known how
to summon and control. It’s a Level 6 Skirmisher with 68 HP and all the standard
swarm traits. Their <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura deals 5 cold damage to enemies inside,
and their basic attack is an <strong>Icicle Stab</strong> that deals cold damage, allows them
to shift 2 squares before or after the attack, and immobilizes on a critical hit
(save ends).</p>

<h3 id="frost-witch">Frost Witch</h3>

<p>A typical member of the group. This one is human, but you can make her an elf or
gnome by adding the proper traits. She’s a Level 8 Controller with 87 HP. She
projects a <strong>Frost Aura</strong> (1) that makes enemies inside vulnerable 5 to cold. If
the enemy was resistant to cold, this reduces their resistance, otherwise it
increases any cold damage they suffer as normal.</p>

<p>The witch fights in melee with a <strong>Frost Staff</strong> that deals cold damage and
slides 2 squares on a hit. At range she uses a <strong>Snow Blindness</strong> spell that
deals cold and radiant damage. Cold resistance alone won’t protect you from it!
Targets hit by the spell can’t see anything further than 3 squares away (save
ends).</p>

<p>Once per encounter she can cast an <strong>Icy Blast</strong> (close blast 5) which deals
cold damage, half on a miss, and turns the affected area into a zone of
difficult terrain. This lasts a turn but can be sustained with minor actions.</p>

<h3 id="frost-witch-harpy">Frost Witch Harpy</h3>

<p>Harpy members tend to be a little stronger than the others, and their cold magic
is geared towards enhancing their natural powers. They’re Level 12 Controllers
with 123 HP. They add thunder resistance to the standard Frost Witch traits, and
can fly with a speed of 8 (clumsy). Their <strong>Frost Aura</strong> has a radius of 2. They
fight with <strong>Frost Claws</strong> that do cold damage, ranged <strong>Icy Stares</strong> that do
cold damage and slow, and a <strong>Chilling Screech</strong> encounter power that hits a
Close Burst 2, does cold and thunder damage, and if the target was slowed or
immobilized also inflicts ongoing 10 cold damage (save ends).</p>

<p>They’re going to wait to use the screech once multiple players are slowed by
their stare, or by their allies’ powers.</p>

<h3 id="frozen-cauldron-guardian">Frozen Cauldron Guardian</h3>

<p>These elementals are made of frozen mist, and as their name implies they hang
around the Cauldron to protect it from thieves and intruders. They’re Level 15
Brutes with 179 HP. Despite its misty look. Its diffuse nature makes it hard to
hurt but that is represented by its high level and HP total - the creature is
not insubstantial.</p>

<p>The guardian’s basic attack is called <strong>Cold Snap</strong>. It deals cold damage and
causes the target to fall prone. It can also expand itself temporarily for a
<strong>Enveloping Chill</strong> attack (recharge 4+), a Close Burst 1 that deals a bit less
cold damage and knocks prone. It also has an extra rider: targets hit by the
attack take ongoing 10 cold damage and are unable to stand up (save ends both).</p>

<p>Anyone fighting these things will stay prone for most of the fight, which makes
every PC’s job more difficult. They pair really well with melee monsters that
can exploit combat advantage.</p>

<h3 id="clenderi">Clenderi</h3>

<p>The leader of the Frost Witches is probably one of the most powerful individuals
in the Vale. Any fight against her will likely take place near the Frozen
Cauldron, so she can expect help from a bunch of Guardians and any other
high-ranking witches the GM cares to stat up.</p>

<p>Clenderi is an elf, and a Level 18 Elite Controller with the Leader tag and 344
HP. She projects a <strong>Frost Aura</strong> that inflicts Vulnerable 5 Cold on any enemies
while they’re inside. She also has the usual elven <strong>Wild Step</strong> that lets her
ignore difficult terrain when she shifts. She already ignores ice-based terrain
anyway due to Ice Walk, but it’s also hard to restrict her movement in other
ways. She can also benefit from <strong>Elven Accuracy</strong> once per encounter, which
lets her reroll an attack roll that she dislikes and take the second
result. In practical terms, she can reroll an attack she missed.</p>

<p>Clenderi’s <strong>Frost Staff</strong> basic attack works like that of the typical frost
witch, dealing cold damage and sliding 2 squares. Her <strong>Icy Glare</strong> is an
at-will ranged attack that deals cold damage and immobilizes. She can cast a
<strong>Wind of Winter</strong> spell (recharge 5+) that deals cold damage in a selectice
Area Burst 2 and creates a zone of icy wind that lasts for a turn. This is
difficult terrain to creatures without ice walk, and allows Clenderi’s allies
who are inside to spend a move action to teleport 10 squares to a space outside
the zone.</p>

<p>Her ultimate technique is the <strong>Frostfall</strong> encounter power, a Close Blast 3
that deals cold damage and turns victims to ice! This is equivalent to being
petrified, and is a (save ends) condition. On a miss, the target takes half
damage and is restrained for a turn.</p>

<p>All of her spells target Fortitude, so most of the party’s squishies are going
to be especially vulnerable to them.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The greatest thing about the Frost Witches are their interactions with the other
factions in the Winterbole Forest. The basic idea of an ice cult conspiring to
take over the world really comes alive when you factor in those interactions and
can see how they actually interact with the world around them.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Felldrakes are a Vale-specific new addition to the game.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Shortly after signing the pact that transformed them, the ruling nobility of
Bael Turath set about applying their newfound infernal power in several ways
they felt would benefit the empire. One of the things they did was magically
alter the many breeds of drake the Turathi already employed to make them
stronger and more vicious. These magically altered breeds became known as
felldrakes.</p>

<p>Though felldrakes are considered natural animals, they’re much more aggressive
and territorial than other species and are susceptible to control via old
Turathi techniques and infernal magic. The Fell Court from our previous entry
was taught the secret of controlling these creatures by their diabolical
patrons. It’s possible other groups have learned it as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Like other drakes, these are Natural Beasts. They’re a varied lot, though, and
their abilities are specific to each stat block.</p>

<h3 id="leaping-felldrake">Leaping Felldrake</h3>

<p>This Small drake looks like a green-scaled lizard. As the name implies they’re
capable of long flying leaps, but they’re also pretty good at lying in
ambush. Their jaws are very efficient at biting the necks of their victims, and
their saliva contains a weak venom that turns the flesh around the bite mark
blue. They were used to protect homes and vaults from burglars, and those blue
marks aided in tracking any culprits that escaped.</p>

<p>Leaping Felldrakes are Level 1 Lurkers with 26 HP. They have ground and climb
speeds of 6. Their basic <strong>bites</strong> are a little weak, but they can use <strong>Neck
Bites</strong> against targets granting them combat advantage. This deals about double
the damage of a basic bite and allow the drake to grab the target (escape DC
12), dealing them ongoing 5 damage while the grab lasts.</p>

<p>The drake’s <strong>Flying Leaps</strong> allow them to fly 3 squares without provoking
opportunity attacks. If they have cover, concealment, or no enemies within 5
squares, they can use <strong>Instant Camouflage</strong> to become effectively invisible
until they attack or cancel the effect. That’s how it gains combat advantage in
most situations, though flanking also works fine in a fight against multiple
monsters.</p>

<h3 id="crested-felldrakes">Crested Felldrakes</h3>

<p>These Small drakes are kinda like a cross between a standard <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/01/27/drakes.html">guard drake</a>
and a Jurassic Park raptor. They’re pack hunters like unmodified guard drakes,
but they’re stronger and smarter than then. Crested felldrakes have been known
to climb on top of one another to reach high places, or to open doors with their
claws to get at victims on the other side.</p>

<p>Crested Felldrakes are Level 2 Skirmishers with 39 HP. They have a ground speed
of 8 and their <strong>Pack Frenzy</strong> trait gives them +1 to hit and +2 to damage when
adjacent to a felldrake ally. Their <strong>bites</strong> damage and allow a felldrake ally
within 2 squares of the attacker to shift up to 2 squares as a reaction. When
hit by an opportunity attack, they can automatically shift 2 squares. This
doesn’t negate the damage from the attack, but it also doesn’t use up an action,
so it can be done as often as you like. The more you hit them, the more mobile
they are.</p>

<h3 id="hissing-felldrake">Hissing Felldrake</h3>

<p>Another Jurassic Park-inspired monstrosity, this is a Medium drake with a large
folding frill around its neck and the ability to spit a corrosive venom laced
with soporific chemicals. It’s Level 3 Artillery with 38 HP.</p>

<p>They can <strong>bite</strong> but the star of the show is clearly their <strong>Fell Spit</strong>, a
ranged attack that targets Reflex and deals acid damage. If the target is
bloodied, they become slowed for a turn. If they’re already slowed, they instead
become dazed (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="tri-horned-felldrake">Tri-Horned Felldrake</h3>

<p>The larger and most aggressive of the felldrake subspecies, but also oddly
enough the easiest to domesticate. The Turathi enforced an instinctive pecking
order with tri-horns at the top, so they have some ability to control other
felldrake species.</p>

<p>Tri-horns are Medium Level 4 Soldiers with 58 HP. They have a speed of 5, are
immmune to fear, and gain a +3 to damage when charging. They can <strong>bite</strong> and
also perform <strong>challenging gores</strong> that deal about the same damage and mark for
a turn. If a marked target makes an attack that doesn’t target the drake, it can
use a melee reaction to automatically deal light damage and knock them prone.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The origin of the felldrakes gives you ample excuse to have a wild pack of them
that attacks on sight and fights to the death, unlike most natural
beasts. However they really come into their own as pets to the Fell Court or to
other similar groups that know how to control and boost them in the same way.</p>

<p>They could also be used as additional Dark Drake species to go with the Dark
Drake of the Moon Hills. Maybe the Dark Drake is a supernaturally powerful
felldrake who survives since the days of Bael Turath?</p>
