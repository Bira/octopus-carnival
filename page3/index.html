<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Chathrangs are big carnivorous tortoises with built-in anti-air artillery. The
many spiny protusions on their shells are tubes that can spit out sticky
envenomed quills, with or without a tether that lets them reel in their
catch. Their usual hunting method is to hide in an oasis amid natural reeds or
other plants, wait for small birds or large insects to fly overhead, and shoot
them.</p>

<p>If no suitable flying critters are present, they’ll go for land-based prey. They
tend to become too enthusiastic or desperate at these times, and might try to
reel in something they can’t handle. Like a PC, for example.</p>

<p>Chathrangs usually live and travel in groups of about three. They don’t have a
lot of combat ability outside of their one neat trick, so it’s common for them
to enter symbiotic relationships with other creatures to share prey in exchange
for a bit more protection. When hurt, they behave like other tortoises and hide
inside their shells.</p>

<p>Charthrangs are impossible to train, but some people keep them around to “milk”
their venom. If a battle against their keepers ends up bursting into the
charthrang enclosure, the creatures will follow their instincts.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>These critters are Medium Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag and a stately
ground speed of 4. They’re Level 9 Artillery with 81 HP, so I guess even a
monster described as “relatively weak” rates high-Heroic stats in this world.</p>

<p>The creature’s <strong>Spiny Shell</strong> acts as an aura (1) that deals 5 damage to anyone
who starts their turn inside, but they charthrang doesn’t really want PCs to get
that close. Instead, it wants to stay far away and shoot its Range 20 <strong>spine
shots</strong>, which do poison damage on a hit. The beast can increase its rate of
fire and use a <strong>Spine Volley</strong> instead, attacking two targets with one action.</p>

<p>Attaching a sticky strand to a spine turns it into the <strong>Poisoned Tether</strong>
attack, which does the same damage and immobilizes the target. While immobilized
by this attack, the target cannot be pushed, pulled, or slid by anything other
than the <strong>Reel In</strong> minor action, which pulls it 5 squares. Escape requires
either passing a save as normal, or teleporting.</p>

<p>If the charthrang is damaged by an attack, it can <strong>retreat into its shell</strong> as
a reaction. Until the end of its next turn it’s slowed, can’t attack, gains a +5
to AC, and doubles the damage done by its aura.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Aside from the standard encounter disposition mentioned in the lore, chatharangs
are also very amenable to reskinning. If you read the Cactus entry and felt that
you needed cactus artillery to complement the lurkers, you can just replace
Reptile with Plant on the chathrang stat block and call it a day. Describe them
as big spherical cacti that move by rolling around and otherwise behave the
same.</p>

<p>The mechanics are interesting. Range 20 is a lot! A cluster of three of these
machine-gun tortoises can sit very far back behind a line of 2-4 soldiers or
brutes and wreak havoc on the PCs by directly targeting their squishies, and
reeling them towards Team Monster’s frontline. Multiple charthrangs can stick
their tethers to the same PC and alternate their use of Reel In to bring the
victim closer that much faster, too.</p>

<p>That is, of course, if the GM plays them smart. This is absolutely not required,
as these are simple animals with a reputation for trying to catch things too
dangerous for them to handle.</p>

<p>Still… anti-air tortoises. What a world.</p>

<p>Cacti are an important part of the Athasian ecosystem, and their natural water
collection mechanisms are often vital to allow people to survive in its
deserts. But in Dark Sun, sometimes the cactus drinks you.</p>

<p>This entry presents two D&amp;D Plant Monsters with that Darker and Sunnier edge to
them.</p>

<h2 id="zombie-cactus">Zombie Cactus</h2>

<p>One of the most prized cactus species in Athas is the Flowering Oasis Cactus, a
beautiful plant whose sweet fruit can instantly satisfy someone’s hunger or
thirst. Finding one of those out in the desert can be a real lifesaver.</p>

<p>The Zombie Cactus takes advantage of this by looking exactly like a Flowering
Oasis Cactus to draw its victims in. Its fruit is just as sweet, but it’s filled
with mind-affecting poison nectar that dominates those who eat it. If the victim
is too wary to eat, the cactus can release a cloud of spores that has the same
effect before uncoiling its tendrils to deal with anyone still free. People
killed while under the cactus’ influence immediately raise as zombie cactus
thralls.</p>

<p>All of this is way too evil to be a coincidence. Sages believe zombie cacti are
an engineered bioweapon, the work of slavers employing psychic powers and
defiling magic. The creatures proved too uncontrollable to be used as tools, and
enough escaped their creators to take root in the wild.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Zombie Cacti are Large Natural Magical Beasts with the Plant tag. Yes, they’re
intelligent. They’re also Level 11 Elite Lurkers with 182 HP, Tremorsense 10,
and a ground speed of 2 with Earth Walk. Yes, they’re ambulatory.</p>

<p>You’ll usually find the cactus in its <strong>Innocuous Form</strong>, which is nearly
identical to a flowering oasis cactus (Nature DC 27 to notice the
difference). It can do nothing in this state except assume its true form as a
minor action. While disguised, the cactus has Resist 15 all and
Regeneration 5. Wearing the disguise again takes a standard action.</p>

<p>A disguised cactus is still dangerous because of its <strong>Poison Fruit</strong>, described
as a passive trait. It will have between four and eight of these, which can be
eaten by another character as a minor action. Anyone who eats them is dominated
by the cactus (save ends). A dominated victim who is reduced to 0 HP can no
longer save against this. Note there’s no attack roll here - eat the fruit, get
dominated, period.</p>

<p>Once the jig is up, the cactus uncoils and releases a cloud of <strong>Dominating
Spores</strong> (close burst 3 vs. will), which has the same effect as the fruit on a
hit. The burst also creates a spore-filled zone that inflicts -5 to saves
against zombie cactus domination for a turn. This power recharges when the
cactus uses Innocuous Form, giving us our “lurker loop” (breathe out, breathe
in).</p>

<p>Once enough people are dominated, the cactus will use its <strong>Tendrils</strong>, which do
standard damage and an additional ongoing 10 necrotic (save ends) if the target
is dominated by the cactus. <strong>Lashing Tendrils</strong> lets it attack two different
targets with this attack.</p>

<p>When someone dominated by the cactus dies, they become a Zombie Cactus Thrall at
the start of their next turn. This zombie is a Level 11 Minion Brute. It can
<strong>Slam</strong> and <strong>Grab</strong> for the same amount of damage, but it prefers the later
because it can pull grabbed targets along with itself when it moves (probably
closer to the cactus). When it drops to 0 HP, it releases a <strong>Spore Burst</strong> in a
Close Burst 1 that has the same attack bonus and effects as the cactus’ cloud!</p>

<p>If the PCs want to resurrect a victim of the cactus, they must destroy the
corresponding thrall first. After that, the usual rituals can be applied.</p>

<h2 id="hunter-cactus">Hunter Cactus</h2>

<p>These aren’t engineered bioweapons. They’re “merely” fast, aggressive predators
that pose as innocent plants and use their venomous spines to drain the blood of
their prey.</p>

<p>A Hunter Cactus is a Large Natural Magical Beast with the Plant tag, and a Level
12 Lurker with 82 HP. It has Tremorsense 20 and a ground speed of <em>six</em>.</p>

<p>When the hunter cactus stands still, it takes a DC28 Nature check to realize
it’s not a mundane plant. It will probably begin its attack with a <strong>Spine
Burst</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Reflex, recharge 5+). It deals no damage right away,
but inflicts 20 ongoing poison damage and blindness (save ends both)! From then
on it will use its <strong>Feeding Spine</strong> on any blinded creatures, damaging and
grabbing them on a hit. It can grab up to two creatures this way. A minor action
lets it sustain all grabs and auto-damage the grabbed creatures.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the cactus cannot run away with grabbed creatures, so it will stand
its ground and fight any remaining foes with <strong>Slams</strong> that deal standard damage
and ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends). If the cactus is hit while it has a
creature grabbed, the <strong>Psychic Feedback</strong> reaction deals psychic damage to the
victim equal to the damage the cactus just took.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Zombie cacti are found in the wild alone or in pairs, surrounded by thralls who
rise up to fight when the cactus reveals itself. Note they are <em>magical beasts</em>,
and therefore capable of forming alliances with other creatures. Commonly, that
will be a wild predator who they train to draw victims to the cactus so they can
share the spoils. Sometimes other people will coerce a zombie cactus into
service, a fate it will always try to escape.</p>

<p>Hunter cacti are more amenable to cooperation with humanoids, who can easily
train them to attack only designated targets in exchange for a regular supply of
food. In these cases they will be found alongside other guardians.</p>

<p>These are neat, and very nasty. Cactus drinks you indeed.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>This entry goes on and on about how stupid brohgs are, but I think that’s
terribly unfair to them. They’re some of the nicest people we’ve met in this
reading so far.</p>

<p>These four-armed giant-kin wander the wastes in small nomadic bands that
occasionally cross paths to trade gossip and partners. They’re extremely skilled
at surviving the environment in Athas, taking only what they need and leaving
little trace of their passage. Their strong primal magic tradition helps them
with this.</p>

<p>Of course, being both big and relatively peaceful makes them frequent targets
for the many odious slaver organizations in this setting, so they often end up
captured and put to work as heavy laborers, muscle, or gladiators. Enslaved
brohg who manage to break free often seek employment as mercenaries.</p>

<p>Brohgs have both an innate ability to sense arcane magic, and an intense
cultural distrust of it, as they associate all arcane magic with defiling and
believe it to be cursed. Very rarely, a brohg will be born with innate arcane
potential (like a PC sorcerer). These individuals end up exiled from their
communities, as they’re believed to be hosts to “evil spirits” and destined to
bring disaster. Left to fend for themselves with no support, they often end up
creating a self-fulfilling prophecy scenario and becoming cruel defilers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Brohgs are Large Natural Humanoids with the Giant tag. They move at a relatively
slow speed of 6, and have low-light vision. They have four arms and are
ambidexterous, but that doesn’t translate into a specific trait in their stat
blocks - each one has different abilities related to training.</p>

<h3 id="brohg-hurler">Brohg Hurler</h3>

<p>Hurlers are civilians without a lot of combat training, but they get by just
fine by throwing stuff really far away, be that stuff boulders or
enemies. They’re Level 10 Artillery with 82 HP.</p>

<p>Their basic Reach 2 <strong>Slam</strong> attack lets them grab the target on a hit, which is
hilarious because they can then use <strong>Hurl Away</strong> to throw them 10 squares at
another creature, further damaging the “ammunition” as an effect and making a
ranged attack against the second target. For rules purposes, this counts as a
push that leaves the hurled creature adjacent to the second target.</p>

<p>If no one’s stupid enough to get within arm’s reach of a hurler, they can hurl a
<strong>rock</strong> instead, which does similar damage, pushes the target 2 squares, and
knocks it prone.</p>

<h3 id="brohg-warrior">Brohg Warrior</h3>

<p>This is what a trained brohg combatant looks like. When a brohg community is
under attack, warriors step up to cover their retreat. This could also represent
an enslaved or mercenary brohg working for someone else. Warriors are armed with
2 spears, a shield, and a hand kept free to throw rocks. They’re Level 10 Elite
Soldiers with 212 HP.</p>

<p>They can attack with a <strong>spear</strong> that marks for a turn or a thrown <strong>rock</strong> that
knocks prone, and <strong>Double Attack</strong> lets them do that twice in an action in any
combination.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Brohg Taunt</strong> ability is a minor action that lets them mark everyone in
a Close Burst 2, and recharges when they’re bloodied. If a marked enemy within 2
squares moves, the brohg can use <strong>Battle Alacrity</strong> to get a free attack on
them that does light damage and lets then shift 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="brohg-renegade">Brohg Renegade</h3>

<p>One of those banished sorcerers who went all in on defiling magic, and now
wanders alone or at the head of a villainous band, plotting to increase his
power. The Renegade is a Level 13 Solo Controller with 512 HP.</p>

<p>This defiler knows an <strong>Arcane Secret</strong> that lets them roll saves against daze
or stun effects both at the start and end of its turn, even if that effect
doesn’t allow a save (i.e., by having a fixed duration instead). Its <strong>dagger</strong>
basic attack is a <em>minor</em> action that does normal damage, and a little bit of
extra force damage if the target doesn’t end their next turn at least two
squares away from the renegade.</p>

<p>Its standard actions are all spells.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Entropy Belt</strong> (ranged 10 vs. will) targets one to three creatures, dealing
psychic damage and pushing 3 squares on a hit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defiling Vortex</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Fort, recharges when bloodied) deals no
damage on a hit, but instead knocks targets prone and weakens then (save
ends). Missed enemies take necrotic damage. At the end of all this, the
renegade gains 5 temp HP for every target it hit with the power.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defiling Blast</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Ref, recharge 5+) does necrotic damage
and dazes (save ends). The renegade gains a +4 to all damage while any target
remains dazed by this power.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And as it suits a solo, we also get a ton of triggered actions. The renegade has
the same <strong>Variable Resistance</strong> as a demon, usable 2 times per encounter. To
refresh our memories: the value of this resistance is 10, and when the renegade
takes elemental damage it can switch the resistance to resist that damage type
as a free action, up to the encounter limit, when the resistance retains its
final type.</p>

<p>If an enemy hits the renegade while granting combat advantage to it, the
renegade can cast a <strong>Wrath Sphere</strong> (close burst 1 vs. Fort) against that
enemy, dealing force damage and pushing it 2 squares on a hit. And when the
renegade is first bloodied, <strong>Bloodied Defiling</strong> triggers to let it immediately
recharge and use Defiling Blast again.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of stuff, but that’s a solo for you. Almost dragon-like, this one.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Free broghs have no reason to quarrel with PCs unless provoked, and if that
happens the warriors will cover the retreat of the rest of the group while
hurlers help from further away. They might also keep several of the hardy beasts
described in this book, and they might help in a fight too.</p>

<p>Enslaved or mercenary individuals might be found in mixed sapient encounter
groups. Renegade defilers will often be <em>leading</em> such a villain group. A single
renegade is a nice “welcome to paragon tier” boss fight. One plus some
lieutenants makes for a nice set piece battle for mid-paragon heroes.</p>

<p>I like their mechanics and I like parts of their lore, but as I already
mentioned I don’t like the way the book keeps saying how brohgs are stupid and
simple-minded, and how it manages to make them superstitious despite living in a
D&amp;D world and having their own working magical tradition. Distrusting arcane
magic in Dark Sun is sensible, but having the brohgs do it because they falsely
believe it’s a curse from evil spirits is a step too far in my opinion.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Braxats used to be natural beasts long ago, but according to the book were
uplifted by a “grim magical influence” over centuries of exposure to become the
huge and extremely antisocial insectile/reptilian humanoids they are today.</p>

<p>Braxats view all relationships, including those with other braxats, in terms of
dominance and coercion. They treat anyone weaker than them with contempt at
best, viciously hate anyone they see as equals, and only grudginly submit to
those they perceive as stronger. Each group is smaller than the one before, of
course. They have a particularly hate for half-giants for some reason.</p>

<p>Sometimes one of Athas’ many shady organizations manages to convince young
braxats to work for them as muscle through either bribery or intimidation. This
never lasts long, as the creatures are incapable of forming true loyalties and
either leave or betray their bosses if they survive and grow strong enough.</p>

<p>That same emphasis on coercion also applies to braxat reproduction
(yikes!). Braxats reproduce when there’s enough surplus food to go around, and
lay their eggs in secluded caves and other similar shelters.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Braxats are Natural Humanoids, with young specimens starting at Large and adults
reaching Huge size. They have Speed 8, acid resistance that increases with tier,
low-light vision, and the <strong>Threatening Reach</strong> trait, which means they can make
opportunity attacks against anyone inside their full melee reach, not just
adjacent enemies. They rely on their carapace for protection and use their fists
or heavy clubs as weapons. They can also spit acid and use psychic powers,
though the exact mechanics vary on each stat block.</p>

<h3 id="braxat-juvenile">Braxat Juvenile</h3>

<p>A still-young individual that’s nevertheless old and large enough to strike out
on its own. As mentioned above, some juveniles are conditioned from an early age
to view another creature as its superior, but that only lasts until the braxat
grows large and smart enough to see it’s stronger. Mercenary arrangements tend
to last a bit more. Many juveniles never grow to see adulthood, dying during
their work as muscle for Athas’ various villainous organizations.</p>

<p>Juveniles are Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They’re “merely” size Large, and have
Acid Resistance 10. Their melee attacks are reach 2 and consist of either a
basic <strong>Slam</strong> that marks for a turn on a hit, or a <strong>Thrash</strong> ability that does
the same damage and knocks prone on a hit.</p>

<p>At range, they can use their <strong>Caustic Spit</strong> (ranged 5 vs. Reflex) to deal
immediate and ongoing acid damage, also slowing the target (save ends
both). When a marked enemy within 3 squares tries to move away from the
juvenile, they can use a <strong>Telekinetic Barrier</strong> as an interrupt to slide the
enemy back towards a square adjacent to the braxat.</p>

<h3 id="braxat-raider">Braxat Raider</h3>

<p>A typical adult specimen, now grown to Huge size. It wanders the wastes alone or
with a small band of followers, setting up camp near caravan routes or villages
that they periodically raid for livestock and people to eat.</p>

<p>Raiders are Level 14 Elite Soldiers with 280 HP. Their melee reach is 3, and
their acid resistance is 15. They fight with <strong>greatclubs</strong> whose basic attacks
damage and slide 1 square on a hit, and mark for a turn as an effect. They can
also be used for <strong>Greatclub Sweeps</strong> (recharge 5+) that target a Close Burst 2
and knock prone on a hit.</p>

<p>The raider’s acid spit is a <strong>Scathing Spray</strong> (Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex,
recharges when first bloodied) that has similar effects to the juvenile’s spit
on anyone it hits, and does half damage on a miss. Its TK barrier evolves to
<strong>Telekinetic Harness</strong> (immediate reaction), letting it pull marked enemies
that end their turns not adjacen to the raider up to 6 squares.</p>

<p>They also get an entirely new psychic power: <strong>Agonize</strong> (ranged 10 vs. will)
deals psychic damage and slows for a turn, and doesn’t provoke opportunity
attacks when used.</p>

<h3 id="braxat-lord">Braxat Lord</h3>

<p>Braxats who live to reach the peak of their power are strong enough to set
themselves up as regional despots, as only the most powerful creatures in Athas
can hope to win against them. They view pretty much anyone else as either
potential slaves, or potential meals.</p>

<p>The Braxat Lord is a Level 23 Elite Soldier with 428 HP and 20 acid
resistance. Like the Raider, it’s Huge and its melee reach is 3. It fights with
a <strong>Maul</strong> that damages and slides 2 squares on a hit, and marks for a turn as
an effect. It can attack at range with the <strong>Crushing Pain</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Fort) psychic power, which deals psychic damage, immobilizes for a turn, and
slows for another turn as an aftereffect. The <strong>Attack Flurry</strong> power lets it
use the maul twice and Crushing Pain once in the same standard action, against 2
or 3 targets.</p>

<p>Its acid spit power is <strong>Vitriolic Spew</strong>, a Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex that deals
immediate and ongoing acid damage. It also turns the blast area into lightly
obscured difficult terrain that deals acid damage to anyone ending their turn
inside, and lasts until the end of the lord’s next turn.</p>

<p>The psychic powers don’t end there either! <strong>Overawe</strong> (recharge 5+) is a minor
action Close Burst 10 that targets all creatures marked by the lord, deals
psychic damage, makes them grant combat advantage, and forbids them from using
opportunity or immediate actions (save ends both). And its <strong>Telekinetic
Harness</strong> works like the raider’s but also restrains those pulled by it and
deals ongoing psychic damage (save ends both).</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think the encounter examples are pretty well described above. As for my
impressions, braxats seem to be some of the worst people in Athas, and that’s
saying something. They feel like Darker and Sunnier evil ogres or giants. The
three variants slot neatly into the ogre/giant/titan role, respectively.</p>

<p>What do fey look like in a world whose environment as deeply fucked up as
Athas’? Let’s check it out.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Belgoi (singular and plural are the same) lived in the Feywild before it was
destroyed in ancient Athasian history, and they weren’t the most pleasant of fey
back them. They took refuge in the world, but eventually came to hate it and all
its residents. Now they live to despoil everything they touch.</p>

<p>Belgoi organize into small nomadic tribes led by the strongest member. They’ll
stop at a location and live there for a while, moving on when everything around
them is ruined, consumed, or polluted. They often go out hunting, and will eat
anything and anyone they can catch. They prefer sapient victims because they
think meat tastes better when seasoned with terror, and that eating someone lets
them absorb the victim’s power. That’s why they also eat their own dead.</p>

<p>Eladrin are their preferred victims, since the belgoi blame them for the
destruction of their homelands.</p>

<p>Belgoi wear leather or hide armor, which I guess is true of most fighters on
Athas. They fight with claw or spear, and wield small bells which they use to
channel their magic. Ringing the bell allows them to lure targets closer for the
kill, isolating them from their peers and breaking their formations.</p>

<p>This makes me think their name is a horrible pun (belgoi == “bell guy”).</p>

<p>Some of them have the ability to drain a victim’s life force through the wounds
they inflict. You can see it seeping out and flowing into the creature.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Belgois are Medium Fey Humanoids with Speed 6 and Low-Light Vision. They speak
Common, and all of the stat blocks here are Chaotic Evil. Their signature trait
is that they’re <strong>Hungry For Blood</strong>, which makes all their attacks deal extra
damage against bloodied targets. All of them also have a bell-related power,
which is a little different for each variant.</p>

<h3 id="belgoi-craven">Belgoi Craven</h3>

<p>The weakest and most cowardly of their number, hiding behind more powerful
warriors and waiting for the chance to pounce upon weak or isolated enemies.</p>

<p>These are Level 7 Minion Skirmishers, whose <strong>Craven Slink</strong> gives them a +2
bonus to all defenses when adjacent to an ally (even another craven). Their
<strong>claw</strong> is a standard minion basic attack, and their <strong>Compelling Ring</strong>
(ranged 10 vs. Will, Encounter) can slide the target 5 squares to a square
adjacent to the craven or one of their allies. Dangerous when the more powerful
variants are around!</p>

<h3 id="belgoi-stalker">Belgoi Stalker</h3>

<p>Not every belgoi belongs to a tribe. Stalkers usually travel alone, but can
sometimes join up with mixed humanoid bands that have similar inclinations. They
will also opportunistically insert themselves into ongoing fights, trying to
lure a victim out while they’re busy with other enemies. And you can also just
say a given stalker is with a tribe too, of course. They’re Level 7 Lurkers with
63 HP.</p>

<p>Stalkers will star the fight at a distance, and use the <strong>Enticing Ring</strong>
(Ranged 10 vs. Will) of their bells to lure a target. On a hit the target is
pulled 5 squares and dazed for a turn. The stalker then moves up and uses its
basic <strong>Claw</strong> attack, which deals light physical damage and ongoing 5 damage
(save ends). If the target is dazed, like they would be in this scenario, the
ongoing damage is increased to 15 and the <em>Stalker</em> takes a -5 penalty to its
defenses until the start of its next turn, giving it an incentive to stay
away.</p>

<h3 id="belgoi-hunter">Belgoi Hunter</h3>

<p>Hunters are the main frontline units of a Belgoi attack, engaging enemies
directly with their spears and trying to make them vulnerable to the attacks of
their sneakier fellows. They’re Level 8 Soldiers with 89 HP.</p>

<p>Hunters fight with their <strong>spears</strong>, but instead of charging into the fray
they’ll try to draw enemies to them with the <strong>Ringing Attraction</strong> of their
bells. This minor action power attacks the Will of all enemies in a Close
Burst 5. On a hit, the hunter pulls the target 3 squares and marks it.</p>

<p>The hunter can then use its <strong>Stakeout</strong> attack against an enemy it has marked,
which deals the same damage as the basic spear strike and immobilizes the target
for a turn.</p>

<p>This set of powers is perfect for a tactic where hunters get the party’s
defenders out of position so a large horde of cravens or a stalker can slip
through.</p>

<h3 id="belgoi-caller">Belgoi Caller</h3>

<p>Callers usually lead belgoi tribes and hunting bands. They’re visibly more
powerful than their followers, and have access to stronger magic and psychic
powers that help their allies and hinder their foes. Not every hunting band will
have a caller in it, but when they show up they’re bad news. Callers are Level 8
Elite Controllers with the Leader tag and 178 HP.</p>

<p>They can fight with <strong>Claws</strong> that damage and inflict ongoing 5 damage (save
ends), but their actions are better spent on their <strong>Ennui Lash</strong> power (minor
action, melee 3 vs. Will), which does equivalent psychic damage and inflicts a
-2 penalty to Will for a turn. That opens the enemy up to their bigger powers,
and to the psychic attacks of their buddies.</p>

<p>The first big power is <strong>Command of the Bell</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will, recharge
4+), which deals psychic damage, slides the target 3 squares, and forces them to
make an at-will attack against an ally of the caller’s choice. Not a basic
attack, an <em>at-will</em> attack.</p>

<p>The other big power is <strong>Distant Ringing</strong> (area burst 3 within 10 vs. Will,
recharge when first bloodied), which deals psychic damage to enemies caught
inside and pulls them towards the center of the burst. Allies caught inside can
shift 1 square and roll a save.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Encounters with groups of belgoi are pretty similar to the ones described for
the lone stalker above. They creep around the party trying to stay undetected
until their targets are vulnerable or engaged in another fight, try to lure and
kill as many victims as they can.</p>

<p>They’ll use clever ambush tactics and take advantage of terrain as much as
possible, but don’t seem to like surrendering or talking. They always begin with
the ambush, and run away if things don’t go their way, possibly to return later
for revenge.</p>

<p>I like their mechanics, but I’ll admit I can’t get over the pun. Bell
guys. Sigh.</p>
