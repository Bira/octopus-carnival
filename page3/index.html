        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Continuing our exploration of the minor factions at play here, we’ll now look at
those whose presence or attention are centered on the Neverwinter Wood.</p>

<h2 id="gray-wolf-uthgardt">Gray Wolf Uthgardt</h2>

<p>The Gray Wolves were just another typical Uthgardt tribe of no particular
distinction until a few hundred years ago, when they took in human refugees from
Gauntlgrym who had been fleeing their captivity by the mind flayers who lived
there. Some of those had been afflicted by lycanthropy. Time and primal magic
made this condition the tribe’s main power and badge of honor.</p>

<p>In the context of the Neverwinter campaign, this is kinda bad for the PCs
because the Gray Wolves have been captivated by the Shadovar’s honeyed words and
recruited as their agents and shock troops. They expect to be citizens of their
new world-spanning empire, and to be given dominion over all of the North’s
wilderness in exchange for their service.</p>

<p>Fortunately, not all members of the tribe fell for this. Those that didn’t were
cast out and banded together into a group known as the Forsworn, who work to
oppose the works of the Netherese. The Forsworn avoid fighting their own kin,
but the Grey Wolves do not return the favor and try to kill them on sight.</p>

<p>The book recommends using existing werewolf and shifter stat blocks when
building encounters against Grey Wolves, and gives us stats for a Werewolf
Stormcaller (level 6 Artillery) that fulfills a niche not usually covered by
those blocks. It also has stats for Ethraniev Marrowslake, a particularly
bloodthirsty Gray Wolf pack leader (level 7 brute). Both work as you’d expect
for werewolves, with the ability to change shape and both weapon and infectious
bite attacks. The stormcaller has ranged spells that do lightning or thunder
damage.</p>

<p>The Pack Outcast PC was among the first of the Gray Wolves to be exiled, since
they didn’t agree to join the Shadovar right at the start. The Forsworn were
exiled after that, as the tribe’s tactics became more and more violent. As the
campaign start, dissidents are being executed instead of exiled. The Outcast has
an easy in with the Forsworn as written, because the group will likely recognize
the PC as being right all along.</p>

<p>The book says the GM is free to make the Forsworn still be evil if they don’t
want the PCs allying with them, though I probably wouldn’t do that. It leans too
much on the “savage barbarian” trope.</p>

<p>PCs who become friends of the Forsworn might be granted an utility power named
<strong>Primal Surge</strong> as a blessing or reward. It’s an encounter power that triggers
when you use one of your other encounter powers. It lets you roll a d20, and on
a result of 10 or higher the other power is not expended.</p>

<h2 id="iliyanbruen-fey">Iliyanbruen Fey</h2>

<p>This is the group the Iliyanbruen Guardian PC belongs to. As we saw earlier,
they’re descendants of eladrin who fled to the Feywild to survive the
destruction caused on their kingdom by the fall of Xinlenal. When the barriers
between worlds started thinning, they sent expeditions back to the place where
they crossed, and found it occupied by evil fey. They drove those out, and built
an outpost named New Shandarar on both sides of the portal. Then they explored
their old ruins in the middle world and discovered that they had been ravaged by
more than time and disuse - many of their sacred relics and cultural treasures
had been plundered.</p>

<p>The expeditionary force made it their mission to recover what was stolen. All of
them are pretty angry about this: the main difference is some of them are angry
just at the people responsible for the looting, while others are angry at All
The Mortals and want to genocide/conquer the region on principle.</p>

<p>Whether moderate or extremist, the fey of Iliyanbruen are likely to respond with
violence to anyone trespassing on their territory now, unless the Guardian PC is
with them.</p>

<p>The expedition’s commander, Merrisara Winterwhite, is a moderate and the main
reason they haven’t started attacking the region. Several of the community
leaders under her, however, are extremists, and spend all of their time
agitating for more bloodshed. One in particular, a dude named Addemios
Three-Dawn, is a secret worshiper of Asmodeus and in league with the evil fey
the expedition drove away from the portal. He’s the assistant to one of the
city’s priests of Corellon, and his influence is responsible for a lot of the
recent upswing in violent sentiment among the eladrin.</p>

<p>The encounter table for New Shandarar is made up of heroic-tier fey creatures:
elves, eladrin, dryads, unicorns, treants and lots of trained fey
beasts. Addemios is statted up as Level 5 Artillery with ranged and area
spells. He’s far from the most powerful individual in this faction, so I’m
guessing that getting them to back off would involve more than defeating
him. That’d still be an important step, though.</p>

<p>Should the extremists win out, the fey could move to “major faction” status
relatively quickly, as they are a significant military force with some pretty
powerful creatures. They certainly <em>believe</em> they have what it takes to conquer
the region and kill everyone they dislike, but they are probably unaware of the
true extent of the Thayan, Netherese, and Aberrant presences here.</p>

<h2 id="cult-of-the-dragon">Cult of the Dragon</h2>

<p>Unlike the Ashmadai, these cultists have a lot of trouble passing as typical
citizens. The local cell was busy with the usual Cult of the Dragon activities,
which are sucking up to evil dragons and trying to convince them to become
dracoliches. This changed when Valindra (the lich leading the Thayans) took
their leader’s Ring of the Dragon.</p>

<p>Now they work for her as muscle and are also tasked with finding a way to raise
the dead Lorragauth as a dracolich. Their leader, Adimund Kroskas, is working on
that as slowly as possible while he tries to figure out a way to recover his
ring. He hasn’t made much progress in that either and desperately needs
something to change in his situation. He’ll probably try to make a move when a
significant setback occurs in Valindra’s plan - likely one caused by the PCs.</p>

<p>Their encounter table includes humans, genasi, dragonborn, and other “typically
playable” stat blocks.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Looks like I accidentally skipped a few posts when making my last update! So
instead of going to chapter 04 now, we’ll finish out chapter 03 and look at the
minor factions over this and the next two posts.</p>

<p>These factions are considered “minor” because they’re either simpler, less
powerful, or less involved in the region than the majors. Most don’t have custom
stat blocks associated with them, and even if they do I’ll only spend time on
them if they’re really interesting. This post covers the “urban” factions, those
whose territories and attentions are in the city proper.</p>

<h2 id="dead-rats">Dead Rats</h2>

<p>Looks like the wererat gang has a chapter in Neverwinter, led by a one-eyed
lieutenant of Toytere’s name Rrost. Their main racket is smuggling, and as the
campaign starts they managed to set themselves up as the middlemen in the
weapons trade between the Sons of Alagondar and the Thayans. More on that later.</p>

<p>In the longer term, the Rats would like to usurp control of the rebels and use
them to become big shots in the city’s underworld, remaking it in Luskan’s
image.</p>

<p>Their roster features rats, dire rats, and any low-level thug-types you can fit
in, the latter of which can be boosted by a wererat theme pack that gives them
regeneration, an infectious bite, and the ability to assume hybrid form. Rrost
uses the stats for a <strong>Wererat Mugger</strong> introduced here, a Level 4 Brute with a
poisoned morningstar and a stronger bite than what’s in the theme.</p>

<p>The gang would love to kill the Dead Rat Deserter PC, and their ties to the
Thayans are just the thing to get that PC more personally involved in the
campaign’s larger plots.</p>

<h3 id="impressions">Impressions</h3>

<p>Rrost feels like a “Small Bad” who will be a problem at the start of the
campaign for city-focused parties. His plans are big but his faction has no hope
of seeing them realized before the PCs end the Rats’ ambitions for good.</p>

<h2 id="sons-of-alagondar">Sons of Alagondar</h2>

<p>The Sons of Alagondar are die-hard Neverwinter nationalists who believe the city
should be independent of foreign control so that it can once again be the Jewel
of the North and a bastion of goodness. They draw most of their membership from
the holdout population of Neverwinter: those people who never left the city and
spent twenty years protecting and rebuilting it before Neverember arrived with
his mercs. As you might imagine, they vehemently oppose him.</p>

<p>Until very recently their overall leader was a Harper named Cymril, who was
brutally murdered under mysterious circumstances shortly before the start of the
campaign (as seen in the Harper Agent theme). Her death split the Sons into two
sub-factions along generational lines.</p>

<p>On one side you have the Nashers, who take their name from the first Alagondar
lord (the one from the computer games). These young rebels are willing to pay
any cost to see a free Neverwinter and readily resort to violent actions like
rioting, assassination and sabotage. Their leader is a firebrand named Arlon
Bladeshaper.</p>

<p>On the other you have the older Graycloaks, who take their name from the old
city militia. They see themselves as focusing on the big picture, with the
city’s welfare as their highest priority. They focus on building support and
alliances with like-minded groups and the city’s population in general. They
also try to infiltrate and influence Neverember’s organization through bribery,
blackmail, and secret deals. Their leader is the human mage Madame Rosene.</p>

<p>(The Nashers call the Graycloaks “greyhairs”, and the Graycloaks call the Nasher
“gnashers”. Also, there’s a subsection here titled “Fractured but Whole”, which
I can never take seriously after learning about that South Park game.)</p>

<p>It’s the Nashers who decided to partner with and accept help from the Dead Rat
gang and the Thayans. Bladeshaper was a bit leery of this at first but he
quickly changed his mind once he saw his faction start racking up bigger
victories against Neverember’s forces. The Rats, as mentioned before, plan to
take over the Sons and make them into an extension of their planned crime
syndicate. The Thayans are using them to distract New Neverwinter from their own
shenanigans and are happy to push their own agents and the Sons to ever greater
heights of violence to that purpose.</p>

<p>The encounter table for the Sons is entirely composed of stat blocks belonging
to typically playable ancestries, matching Neverwinter’s demographics. Players
who oppose the Sons will do well to play on their divisions, those who want to
support them should focus on healing that same rift. Cymril’s death nearly broke
them completely, and finding the truth behind it would be a big goal in a
rebellion campaign. As we saw in the Harper Agent’s background, there’s room for
a variety of sinister explanations.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-1">Impressions</h3>

<p>Probably the most complex of the minor factions here. It’s possible to make a
campaign entirely focused on the Sons’ struggle, but it would have to start with
earning their trust. They are <em>not</em> predisposed to allying with PCs and are
likely to be actively hostile to certain themes like the Harper Agent or even
the Neverwinter Noble, whom they might see as just another pretender.</p>

<h2 id="harpers">Harpers</h2>

<p>Making Neverwinter into the bastion of good it once was is also part of the
Harper’s mission statement, and they are generally better at sticking to it than
the Sons, but they were broken even more thoroughly by Cymril’s death. She was
their highest ranking member in the area. With her gone, there are about a dozen
members left, and only two of them are full agents.</p>

<p>These local Harpers are pretty focused on opposing Neverember at the moment and
are completely ignorant of the machinations of the Thayans, Netherese, or
Aboleths in the area. It’s unlikely they will find out on their own, but if they
learn through other means they will instantly shift their focus to opposing
these greater threats.</p>

<p>If the PCs manage to acquire a reputation as local heroes, the Harpers might
approach them and ask them to help the Sons of Alagondar get back on track.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-2">Impressions</h3>

<p>The Harper presence in the city is larger than I was led to believe from reading
the Harper Agent theme. My inclination is to only include them as written if the
party doesn’t have one or more PCs with that theme. If it does, then the PC is
the sole Harper left in the region.</p>

<h2 id="many-arrows-orcs">Many-Arrows Orcs</h2>

<p>The orcs of the North usually stayed away from the Neverwinter area, because the
city was hostile to them and they had many stories about how the surrounding
woods were haunted. They have recently dismissed these stories as myths and
grown a little bolder and more curious.</p>

<p>King Obould XVII of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows recently sent a scout force here
with the mission to find what was going on and report back, but the force’s
power-hungry commander far exceeded her orders and decided to push into the city
and take over the Cloak Tower, claiming the surrounding territory in
Neverwinter’s ruined northern half as her own.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, Obould was depicted elsewhere as a reasonable king who
had the capability to turn his people away from their universally hostile ways
and forge more peaceful bonds with his neighbors. Commander Vansi is none of
those things. After taking over the Cloak Tower, she was approached by the
aboleths and gladly accepted a “blessing” of the Spellplague to get
stronger. There’s a stat block for her here. She’s a Level 6 Soldier (Leader)
that fights with a flail and a spiked gauntlet. The Spellplague covered her in
fiery bone spurs, so she loves to grapple.</p>

<p>The encounter table for them is obviously all orcs all the time, with the
occasional ogre or half-orc thrown in for variety.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-3">Impressions</h3>

<p>I kinda like that there’s a more elaborate reason than just “they’re chaotic
evil” for why this group of orcs are hostile occupiers. Neverember has an open
call for adventurers willing to help drive them out of town, and their
connection to the AbSov might be what clues the PCs in to the presence of that
faction.</p>

<p>It’s even possible that King Obould would <em>reward</em> the PCs for dealing with the
rogue detachment if you want to play up the newer, less hostile orcish
civilization.</p>

<h2 id="bregan-daerthe">Bregan D’Aerthe</h2>

<p>These assholes again. They wrung Luskan dry a few decades ago and left the area
when the cataclysm hit. Now a handful of their spies have made their way back to
seek profitable opportunities and report back.</p>

<p>In practice this means you can spice up certain encounters with drow mercs or
informants. They have no elaborate goals for the area yet.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-4">Impressions</h3>

<p>Again, this feels like a minor faction I would only use if there are no Bregan
Spy PCs in the party. If there are, then the PC is their sole representative in
the region. They appear again in a slightly more fun form in the upcoming
locations chapter.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Here begins Chapter 4, the Gazeteer. This takes up the remaining half of the
book and focuses on describing interesting places in the region and their
associated plot hooks. It also talks about interesting NPCs that might get
involved with the group. These locations and people aren’t fully mapped or
statted out, but are intended to serve as starting points for individual GMs to
customize. As promised in the book’s preface, a lot of plot hooks here are
optional and/or multiple-choice, and GMs are free to change anything in here
however they want.</p>

<p>The chapter covers several major areas, and we might need more than one post for
each of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ruined Neverwinter</strong> is the city proper, struggling to rebuild and deal with
political intrigue, dangerous ruins, and plaguechanged monsters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Helm’s Hold</strong> is a stout-hearted village with a monastic community that
hides a terrible threat to the region.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Neverwinter Wood</strong>: You wouldn’t believe how many dangerous places and
threatening factions can fit into this one forest!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Gauntlgrym</strong>: the hidden dwarven city no longer has any dwarves in it, but
it has pretty much everything else including that slumbering primordial.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Evernight</strong> is Neverwinter’s reflection on the Shadowfell and the main
battleground in the war between Thayans and Netherese.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Thay Through the Veil</strong>: PCs who follow the plot threads from Evernight all
the way to their end might find themselves needing to make some visits to Nazi
Necromancer Central.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The encounter table for the Netherese is packed with shadow-themed
opponents. There are a few humans here and there, but also a lot of shadar-kai,
and Dark Ones, and a few new options to turn any of these into Shades. Since
they’re a magic-heavy faction the table also includes a few constructs and bound
incorporeal undead.</p>

<h2 id="shades">Shades</h2>

<p>Shades are creatures that absorbed so much of the Shadowfell’s ambient magic
that they mutated. They can also be born from otherwise “mundane” creatures who
absorbed that energy. As you might expect a lot of the Shadovar fit this
description.</p>

<p>There are two ways to turn a monster stat block into a Shade. The Forgotten
Realms’ campaign setting has a monster template that turns a regular monster
into an elite shade. And this book presents a theme that adds appropriate powers
to an existing creature without upgrading its “quality”.</p>

<p>The theme changes the base creature’s origin to Shadow, adds Darkvision and
Vulnerable 5 radiant and also these three abilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Regeneration</strong> 5, which shuts down for a turn when the creature takes
radiant damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Coalescing Darkness</strong>, a trait that gives the shade total concealment for a
turn whenever it moves 3 or more squares by any means.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shadow Stride</strong>, an encounter power that takes a move action and lets the
shade teleport up to <em>20</em> squares, but requires that the destination space be
in dim light or darkness.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thaalud-constructor">Thaalud Constructor</h2>

<p>One of the most fearsome security measures in Netherese tombs and ruins are the
constructs known as Thaalud Tomb Trappers. The Constructor is a modern design
based on those, weaker but easier to make.</p>

<p>That’s all the lore we get for this monsters. Since I don’t know anything about
tomb trappers I’m forced to speculate based on their stats. I’m thinking they’re
huge eyeless humanoid statues, and quite a bit smarter than your typical
mindless construct.</p>

<p>A constructor is a Huge Natural Animate with the Blind and Construct keywords,
and a Level 5 Elite Brute with 154 HP. It’s immune to poison, blindness, and
gaze attacks, and has Resist 5 to cold, fire, and lightning. It perceives the
world with Blindsight 20.</p>

<p>It attacks with <strong>Mauling Fists</strong> that damage and grab on a hit (escape DC 15),
and can make <strong>double attacks</strong> with them. If the constructor has a Large or
smaller creature grabbed, it can throw it at someone else with <strong>Hurl Foe</strong>, a
ranged attack that damages both the target and the “ammunition”. On a hit, the
target is pushed 1 square and knocked prone, and the hurled PC falls prone on
the target’s former space. On a miss both take half damage and the thrown
character falls prone adjacent to the target. I gotta say “grab and yeet” sounds
like a very fun combat style.</p>

<p>When a constructor is destroyed it <strong>Collapses into rubble</strong>, attacking a Close
Burst 1 around itself and turning that area into a zone of difficult terrain
that lasts until the end of the encounter. Note that the creature is Huge, so
this zone is 4 squares on a side.</p>

<h2 id="clariburnus-tanthul-prince-of-shade">Clariburnus Tanthul, Prince of Shade</h2>

<p>The Shadovar are ruled by the Twelve Princes of Shade, Netherese mages who were
witnesses to the fall of their empire and managed to stay alive(-ish) to the
present day. Clariburnus Tanthul is one of these Twelve.</p>

<p>Contrary to all expectations, he’s not undead! Tanthul is an ancient living
shade, and is described as retaining more of his original humanity than the
other Princes. Still, he’s a merciless manipulator with no concept of honor,
breaking his promises as casually as he breathes.</p>

<p>Clariburnus Tanthul is a Medium Shadow Humanoid and a Level 10 Elite Skirmisher
with 158 HP. He has a Speed of 7 and both Blindsight 10 and Darkvision. His
traits resemble those of the Shade theme above but they’re custom and more
powerful.</p>

<p>His <strong>Benighted Presence</strong> acts as an aura (5) that turns bright light dim, and
his <strong>Regeneration</strong> heals 15 HP per turn, though it’s still shut down for a
turn by radiant damage.</p>

<p>He wields a scimitar named <strong>Gloom Crescent</strong>, which can make basic attacks and
is also used for the <strong>Severing Shadows</strong> technique. This lets him make 2 basic
attacks (3 if bloodied), teleporting 5 squares before each one. If he hits the
same target twice that target also takes 5 ongoing force damage (save
ends). This worsens to 10 ongoing force damage and blindness after the first
failed save (save ends both).</p>

<p>Once per encounter he can use a ranged spell named <strong>By Night Consumed</strong>, which
deals necrotic damage and <em>removes the target from play</em> (save ends). A miss
deals half damage and dazes (save ends). Nasty!</p>

<p>His <strong>Shadow Stride</strong> lets him teleport 5 squares regardless of light
conditions, which increases to 10 if the destination is in darkness. It’s also a
(Recharge 4+) ability instead of an encounter power, so he can use it more than
once in a fight.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>This has less custom stat blocks than some of the other factions, so you’ll be
mostly relying on the encounter table and shade versions of natural
critters. Still, the custom stat blocks we do get are fun, and it looks like
Clariburnus is a genuine Forgotten Realms big shot who would probably get an
epic-level stat block in a more traditional FR setting book. I love it that he’s
“within reach” of a heroic-tier party here. His stats make for a very
interesting fight, though you should also give him an honor guard.</p>

        </h1>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As mentioned several times in this Let’s Read already, Netheril was a human
empire who ruled over most of the world around three thousand years before our
narrative present.</p>

<p>Their understanding of magic reached levels never seen before or since, but they
fell literally overnight when one of their top archmages tried to cast a spell
that was supposed to make him into a god but instead irreversibly fucked up
Toril’s magic. This caused the vast majority of the flying islands where these
archmages lived to plummet to the ground.</p>

<p>One such island managed to avoid this fate when its inhabitants plane-shifted it
into the Shadowfell (known as the Plane of Shadow back then). They stayed there
until the end of Second Edition, when they started coming back into the world,
mutated by their millenia in darkness and with a desire to rebuild their former
empire.</p>

<p>These shadow-people are known as Shadovar, but they also consider themselves to
be Netherese and the book uses the two terms interchangeably. There’s a group of
them hiding in the Neverwinter Wood, led by a mage named Clariburnus Tanthul.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>The Shadovar have a single major goal in this region: to repair the fallen
island of Xinlenal.</p>

<p>Xinlenal was the first Netherese flying island ever built, the crowning
achievement of the ancient archmage Iolaum, who discovered the technique to
making them. Making it fly again would raise the flag of Netherese dominance
over the whole region, and it would become their greatest center of power in the
entire world.</p>

<p>The key to fixing Xinlenal is to repair its <em>mythallar</em>, a magical engine that
looks like a giant crystal sphere and shines like a contained sun. It shattered
when the city fell, and Shadovar artificers are hard at work repairing it as the
campaign starts. The process requires immense quantities of Residuum, and the
easiest way to produce Residuum is to destroy magic items. The older and more
powerful, the better.</p>

<p>This means Shadovar agents are scouring the entire region looking for ancient
ruins and the magical relics they contain. The ruined cities of Illefarn, the
crumbling outposts of Delzoun, even the burial mounds of Uthgardt heroes: all of
these are fair game, and anyone who would object to their plundering is an
enemy.</p>

<p>Not even these ancient ruins might yield enough residuum for their purposes,
though. They’ve started looking at less-old places too. As the campaign starts
that’s still mostly consists of clashing with and looting the bodies of Thayan
and Ashmadai goons, but they could soon move up to plundering Neverwinter
itself.</p>

<p>One of Caliburnus’ secondary goals include discovering the fate of Iolaum. Sure,
the wizard lived thousands of years ago and was on Xinlenal when it fell, but
surely one of the bestest mages from the bestest magical empire ever wouldn’t
let little details like that kill him, would it? Imagine what he could do for
the Shadovar cause if he’s brought on-board!</p>

<p>The other secondary goal is to pursue their war with Thay. There’s only room for
<em>one</em> world-spanning fascist mage empire in this planet, after all. The Shadovar
regularly attack the Thayan base in the Dread Ring, and they’ve also managed to
park one of their flying fortresses above the Thayan city of Surcross, which
they bombard regularly. In case you don’t remember, that’s one of the possible
locations where Valindra might have hidden her soul vessel.</p>

<p>And finally, further down the list, there’s the handling of the Gray Wolf
Uthgardt tribe. The Shadovar recruited them into their service with appeals to
their “ancient Netherese heritage” and gave them the mission to infiltrate and
eventually conquer Helm’s Hold. So far the werewolves have managed to place
several agents in the town, who are busy sowing unrest and generally making it
ready for a takeover. Their progress is slow but in Caliburnus’ view the tribe’s
main purpose is to act as a red herring when people start trying to investigate
Netherese activities. In the meantime, Gray Wolf warriors also get used as
muscle when the need for it arises.</p>

<h2 id="player-tie-ins">Player Tie-Ins</h2>

<p>The Netherese seems to be the major faction with the most explicit tie-ins to PC
backgrounds.</p>

<p>The Scion of Shadow, of course, starts the game in direct conflict with
them. They have enough information to begin opposing the faction right away, and
especially bold Scions might think to pretend to be loyal in order to infiltrate
it.</p>

<p>Their rampant plundering of ancient ruins also places them in direct opposition
to the Iliyanbruen Guardian, Heir of Delzoun, and the Uthgardt Barbarian. The
book says they are definitely guilty of stealing those eladrin relics, but it’s
less definitive about their role in plundering the Uthgardt barrow - that could
have been the Thayans depending on what the GM desires. Even so, their control
of the Gray Wolves will still make them cross paths with both the Barbarian and
the Pack Outcast.</p>

<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>

<p>The Netherese don’t care about <strong>New Neverwinter</strong> at all, though that will
change a bit when they start targeting the city for its magic items.</p>

<p>They are completely ignorant of the <strong>Abolethic Sovereignity</strong>. Some of their
officials suspect there’s something funky going on beneath Neverwinter and have
sent agents to investigate, but they’re only going to bother Caliburnus about
this when those agents return with answers. This makes the fact that they’re
trying to conquer Helm’s Hold particularly funny.</p>

<p>They see the <strong>Ashmadai</strong> as nothing more than minions of the Thayans and have
no idea the cult has plans of its own. The <strong>Thayans</strong> of course are their
greatest enemies in the region and the Shadovar devote as many resources to
fighting them as they do to restoring Xinlenal.</p>

<p>They also have some important links to minor factions, as mentioned above. Their
hold over the Gray Wolves means they will have to deal with the other <strong>Uthgardt
Tribes</strong> eventually, and the <strong>fey of Iliyanbruen</strong> are the primary targets of
their relic raids.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>While the Netherese are a bit less cognizant of the other factions than I
expected, their plans are appropriately ambitious and they have a real shot at
success barring PC intervention. They also have a bunch of strong ties to
several PC themes, so they’re very likely to feature in your campaign.</p>
