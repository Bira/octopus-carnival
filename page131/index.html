<p>This post belongs to a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to
<strong>GURPS</strong>. All other entries, and all other posts adapting the setting can be
found <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Gargoyles in Dragon’s Dogma are pretty much what you’d expect from hearing the
word: humanoid flying monsters with rock-hard skin and a love of clawing out the
eyes of unwary adventurers. The gargoyles of Gransys are living creatures, with
flesh and blood beneath that rock skin, so they add “hunting for food” to their
list of usual reasons for attacking PCs (territoriality, plain cruelty,
etc.). They also have an additional surprise in store: their tails are tipped by
a stinger capable of injecting a petrifying poison into a victim. They can’t eat
the resulting statue, but it’s still a good tactic for finishing off foes who
put up more of a fight than anticipated.</p>

<p>Gargoyles dislike sunlight, and so make their homes in ruins and cave complexes,
particularly those that feature one or more tall chambers full of good nesting
spots. Someone suddenly attacked by a gargoyle in one of these dark places might
confuse them with a harpy at first, only to be surprised at how little effect
their blows have on the creature. Somehow bypassing a gargoyle’s DR is vital to
effectively fighting it.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 17; <strong>DX</strong> 13; <strong>IQ</strong> 6; <strong>HT</strong> 13;</p>

  <li><strong>Petrifactor (14)</strong>: 3d imp + <em>Petrifying Venom</em> follow up. Reach C.</li>
  <li><strong>Petrifying Venom (resisted with HT-5)</strong>: Applied via a sting with the

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Gargoyles only use the petrifactor as a last resort, as they prefer
to be able to eat the victim after killing it.</p>

<p>Welcome to another post in my X-COM: Noises in the Dark actual play report!
These are the PCs that participated in the mission:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kendall Fairbarn</strong>: A paranoid Hacker from the UK. Was completely convinced
human society had been heavily infiltrated by shape-changing aliens… and it
turned out he wasn’t entirely wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Minette Duvall</strong>: A bomb-disposal expert from Southern France, Minette is
also quite handy with a rifle. She’s devoutly Catholic and swears a lot when
faced with danger, which is all the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Niu Yulan (AKA Julia Yulan)</strong>: A former hostage negotiatior from China,
built without a template but approaching a shootier Face. Her innate kindness
and empathy came in handy in several of the missions! Julia was ran by three
different players during the lifetime of the campaign, which earns her a medal
for Most Helpful Backup Character.</li>
  <li><strong>Jack Choi</strong>: A former police detective from Hong Kong, and a staunch
adherent of the “kick down the door” school of policing despite his light
frame. Also built without a template. His player dropped out of the planet
near the end of the game, but not before making things <em>interesting</em> for the
rest of the group.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also part of the team were two NPCs: <strong>Valenkov</strong> from Russia and <strong>Gutierrez</strong>
from Argentina, both built using the Shooter archetype. They were originally
PCs, but their players quit <em>before</em> making even a single post and <em>after</em> I had
established they were members of the squad. I always found it funny that Strike
One never had a single PC Shooter who stayed on for a full mission. I mean, the
PCs can shoot, but none of them make it their primary focus.</p>

<h2 id="the-briefing">The Briefing</h2>

<p>As we saw in the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/02/18/x-com-setup.html">previous post</a> in this series, the newly formed X-COM spent
its first month of existence futilely scanning the planet for alien activity
before they found anything actionable. And it came not from their state of the
art spy satellite network, but from a Youtube video recorded by a 12 year old.</p>

<p>Her name was Gisela Vahlen, and she was Dr. Vahlen’s niece. The video was little
more than a standard “family letter” message, recorded on a laptop camera in
Gisela’s room, but anyone who watched could see that a lot was wrong with
it. The girl had the look of someone who had been living in a war zone for
months, and her room looked like part of said war zone. She struggled to
maintain a cheery tone, despite the evident stress she had been under, and spoke
in English instead of her native German.</p>

<p>Despite all the strangeness, a distressed Dr. Vahlen confirmed that it was
indeed her niece, and that was indeed her room, battle damage
notwithstanding. Pointing one of X-COM’s recon satellites at Cologne revealed an
anomaly of some sort covering Gisela’s neighborhood. It looked as if someone had
smudged the camera lens with a greasy finger. Infrared showed the same
thing. And no one else in the world seemed to have noticed it. There were no
news that anything was out of the ordinary in Cologne.</p>

<p>All of this was relayed to Strike One, our PC team, as part of the first
in-character post of the mission. Their goal was to fly to Cologne, ensure the
safety of the civilians in the area, put a stop to the anomaly, and gather
information on the aliens, in that order.</p>

<p>There were some questions, but Mr. Fox was the first to admit their intel was
crap on this op. The only things X-COM knew were the approximate area the
anomaly covered, and that things seemed to be terrible inside it and functioning
normally outside. At least it would be easy to evacuate from the zone.
Dr. Sokolov had already ordered his team to load the Skyranger up with
scientific gear, and all that was left before they were ready to leave was
gearing up.</p>

<h2 id="meet-the-quartermaster">Meet the Quartermaster</h2>

<p>At this point I introduced the party to another NPC: their quartermaster, Nobuo
Ishikawa. This little troll of a man was known as Kappa-san back in the JSDF,
but here everyone calls him Nobby. Because I firmly believe every military
organization in fiction needs a Nobby.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/nobby1.jpg"/>

</figure>

<p>Our Nobby was more than happy to discuss gear selection with the PCs, and to
laugh at Kendall’s ridiculously large wish list that turned the hacker into a
one-man Ghost Hunters show crew. Most of this stuff was already in the
Skyranger, actually, since Sokolov shared his enthusiasm for unveiling alien
secrets.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the gear, I provided the players with a basic list of
weapons, armor and accessories to choose from. My goal with the weapon selection
was to make it similar to the initial list on the computer games, particularly
the 1994 original. The personal firearms were good for fighting people, but a
little on the anemic side when it came to damaging aliens. Then you had things
like grenade launchers and rockets, which were much more powerful but also
heavier and harder to use. No one took those, though they did pick a mix of frag
and smoke hand grenades. Julia also took a bunch of candy to win the kids over
once they arrived.</p>

<h2 id="insertion-and-investigation">Insertion and Investigation</h2>

<p>Once everyone had finished gearing up, it was time to board the Skyranger! It
looked and behaved pretty much like the one in the 2012 computer game, with a
top speed of Mach 1 and enough fuel to cross the Atlantic. It sacrificed
everything else you would expect from a military transport to achieve that,
being relatively tiny and completely unarmed. It was one of those quirky Russian
designs, and those adjectives also fit its pilot Yevgeny Korsakov quite well.</p>

<p>Even at Mach 1, reaching Germany took a while. Once there, Julia asked Korsakov
to do a flyby of the anomaly zone from a safe height. The passenger compartment
didn’t have any windows, but it did have a monitor wired to an external camera,
which showed the same “smudge” as the satellite image. Julia unbuckled and went
to the cockpit to look through the windows, and found that whatever was messing
with the sensors didn’t affect the Mk I Eyeball. The real landscape wasn’t any
prettier, though.</p>

<p>A region of three or so blocks around St. Marien Hospital in Cologne had been
turned into a veritable war zone. The commercial and residendial buildings in
that area had all been shot up and covered in weird graffiti, gutted car wrecks
littered the cracked and cratered streets… the place must have taken months to
reach such a state, and yet the city continued to function normally around it,
as if no one knew what was going on. St. Marien was the same hospital where all
those drugs had gone bad a while back, so whatever caused this must have
happened around then as well.</p>

<p>It was a good thing that the PCs asked Korsakov to be careful with the flyby,
for soon he spotted someone at the roof of the hospital pointing what looked
like an RPG at them! He manages to dodge the missile at the last minute, and
flies out of there.</p>

<p>The PCs discuss what do do next, and Minette came up with the following plan of
attack:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/brutal-advent-lz.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>
    The Area of Operations.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>They’d have Korsakov land about 100 meters to the left of the red X in the
picture above, on a wide avenue. Then they’d use the available cover to make it
into Gisela’s home, the apartment building marked by the yellow dot. Choi was
enthusiastic about kicking the door down, and Julia objected on the grouds that
they were there to rescue civilians, not antagonize them. Minette reasoned that
they might not have a choice, if the door wasn’t open.</p>

<p>The craft landed, and they made a run for it, cover to cover. Once more it was a
good thing that the PCs decided to be cautious about their advance, since a
sniper began taking shots at them from the hospital! Kendall threw a smoke
grenade to cover the advance, though it didn’t seem to do much. Choi emptied his
PDW in the sniper’s general direction while running, which seemed to have a
better effect. Fortunately, all the commotion seemed to have drawn the attention
of the building’s inhabitants, as a man opened the door for the PCs when they
got close enough, and they all scrambled in. Julia paused to take a last,
long-distance shot at the sniper, and apparently hit! No more shots came from
that direction after that.</p>

<p>The building still housed seven civilians: Gisela, her parents, and another
family with father, mother and two children. There was also a cop, Jan Wiest,
who together with Gisela’s father was the informal leader of the bunch. Minette
was proficient in German, and Gisela’s family was proficient in English, so they
managed to communicate acceptably.</p>

<p>Their situation was every bit as bleak and bizarre as it seemed in the
briefing. A few months ago, shortly after news broke out about the hospital’s
drugs all going bad, a large group of people in unmarked military uniforms and
eyeless gas masks appeared in the hospital building and began killing everyone
they came across. They haven’t really been trying to <em>occupy</em> the neighborhood -
they just stage raids out of the hospital, and drag any bodies back with them
when they return.</p>

<p>Wiest’s unit has been fighting them since nearly the beginning, and the
remaining civilians in the area have either been helping or hiding. A lot left
the area as soon as they could - all those that remain (cops and civilians) stay
out of a sense that they must contain the attackers. Wiest calls for backup
every day, but no one ever answered, and no one ever came, until today.</p>

<h2 id="assessment-and-planning">Assessment and Planning</h2>

<p>This story does nothing to answer the PC’s initial doubts: if this has been
going on for so long, how come no one noticed? Kendall uses his skills and
advanced gear to scan the airwaves, only to find them filled with something that
sounds a lot like wailing and gnashing of teeth run through a “creepypasta”
audio filter. It’s like an especially eerie form of jamming, as it prevents him
from reaching HQ or anything outside the anomaly zone. His attempts to get
through it end up revealing what seems to be alien radio chatter… which sounds
exactly like the jamming except for the fact that it also has the cadence of
someone with military training talking over radio. He also scans the laptop
Gisela used to send her video message, but finds it to be a normal Macbook Air
despite the occasional spooky image bleeding through its normal interface.</p>

<p>The squad gets together to discuss what they learned here. The detailed workings
of this anomaly are still a mystery, but it’s clear that it’s somehow preventing
information about what’s going on here from getting out, and it’s likely
affecting the minds of those within as well. The last bit would explain why any
civilians still say in there rather than simply making a run for it. Assuming
it’s being generated by some sort of transmission equipment, its shape indicates
that this equipment is located in the hospital and likely guarded by these
masked alien invaders. They’re going to have to get in there in order to stop
it.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>If you’ve been reading this blog for a while, you’ll know that I’ve already
converted no less than eleven Pathfinder Iconic characters to Dungeon Fantasy,
one for each of the templates from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 1:
Adventurers</strong>. You’ll also know that you can find a handy list of all of them
in <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">this page</a>, which declares that the project as a whole is done. So why
the heck are you seeing yet another of these articles here?</p>

<p>Well, the simplest reason is because I wanted to do another one. Consider this a
bonus track for the Pathfinder Iconics in Dungeon Fantasy album! As such, it
doesn’t quite follow the rules I set for myself in the main set of eleven
iconics.</p>

<p>You see, our subject today is Seoni the Sorceress. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Seoni.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2007 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I have to say this isn’t one of Wayne Reynolds’ best efforts, since the
proportions and the pose are a bit weird. That aside, Seoni stands out among the
Iconics in that she shows quite a bit of skin, tough at least her bio gives us a
reason for that. That bio is somewhat split between the page containing her
<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/seoni.html">d20 stats</a> and this <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la75?Meet-the-Iconics-Seoni">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>As the Iconic Sorcerer, Seoni represents a class that’s present in the
Pathfinder <em>and</em> d20 core rules, but absent from <strong>DF 1</strong>, which had the
Swashbuckler instead. It’s not hard to see why: any of the “traditional”
spellcasters from <strong>DF 1</strong> are already about as versatile as a d20 Sorcerer. It
would be a while until GURPS had an officially published template that had the
same relationship to the other spellcasters as their d20 counterparts. That
template turned out to be the aptly-named Sorcerer from <strong>Pyramid #3/82</strong>, which
in turn uses rules from <strong>GURPS Thaumathology: Sorcery</strong>.</p>

<p>So now that I’ve explained my reasoning, let’s look at what we can learn from
Seoni’s bio and stats.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>She comes from the land of Varisia, and belongs to the nomadic culture of its
original inhabitants. This culture is roughly analogous to the Romani of our
world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to her mystical bloodline, Seoni has experienced mysterious visions since
a very young age, and her quest to understand those has led to the awakening
of her powers. The tatoos covering most of her body are both a status symbol
in her culture and a focus for her magic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seoni’s obsession with being in control of her own fate combines with her
penchant for detailed plans to make her look like a “control freak” to her
companions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is <em>extremely</em> blasty. The vast majority of her abilities deal direct
damage, usually with fire or lightning. The rest are either straightforward
combat debuffs (<em>glitterdust</em>, <em>dispel magic</em>) or energy barriers (<em>mage
armor</em>, <em>shield</em>, <em>wall of force</em>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our version of Seoni certainly manages to uphold the “less known spells cast
more frequently” motto of the d20 Sorcerer. She knows all of four spells, but
she can cast all of them all day long without even spending FP as long as she
can both move and speak when she does so. She can only use one of them at a
time, but Accelerated Casting allows her to switch effects without pausing. She
can do passably well at social endeavors with her training in Diplomacy and her
Charisma, and can improvise any minor spell with a full cost of 7 points or
less, but what she’s really good at is spamming lightning bolts all day, every
day.</p>

<p>As for power-ups, she can always use more Sorcery spells! Her mundane skills are
lacking a bit, so any spare points there also help. Those players willing to
save points for a while can fully master Dispel Magic for an additional 48
points, which would enable Seoni to cast and maintain 2 effects at once.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/01/03/x-com-post-mortem.html">big post-mortem</a> on the Noises in the Dark campaign setting seems to
have been relatively well-received, and I’ve been in search of subjects to talk
about, so I’m going to make that campaign A Thing here in Octopus Carnival. I’ll
post a few more specific descriptions of my setup and play reports for the
actual field missions!</p>

<p>This will break up the blog’s so far relentless stream of fantasy posts with
some modern articles, and give me something to write about that’s easier to do
than coming up with stats for Dragon’s Dogma Bestiary monsters. After all,
everything that’s here already happened. I’m not sure I can post the GURPS stats
I made up for the Dreams of Ruin monsters or their environmental effects, but
pretty much everything else should be fair game. If you really want to see those
stats then <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/152691/The-Dreams-of-Ruin">throw some money in Mr. Grabowski’s direction</a> so the material
can be freed earlier!</p>

<p>In this post I’ll try to expand a bit on the basic setup for the X-COM side of
the campaign, since that part is all me.</p>

<h2 id="step-one-recruitment">Step One: Recruitment</h2>

<p>This was a forum-based game on RPG.net, so the first thing I did was to put up a
recruitment thread. I laid out the basic premise of the game: it’s GURPS X-COM,
with soldier PCs and occasional “strategic” interludes where the players
themselves made decisions for the organization. Prospective players should post
character concepts, and I would choose which ones would fill the group.</p>

<p>Recruitment was <em>not</em> on a first-come, first-served basis, as I had been burned
in the past by doing that and ending up with one or more severely disrupting
players. The lot I got from this round of recruitment was pretty nice, though!</p>

<p>Two of them would end up bailing out from the game before their first
in-character post, but I wasn’t too upset with that - it’s pretty much the cost
of doing business in forum games. I always recruit a number of players slightly
higher than what I think I can easily handle for this reason.</p>

<p>Obviously if you’re planning on replicating this campaign in a face to face
game, you wouldn’t have this issue.</p>

<h2 id="step-two-choose-your-destiny">Step Two: Choose Your Destiny</h2>

<p>Once the initial group of players had been locked down, I presented them with a
series of decisions that would shape the campaign to come.</p>

<h3 id="choose-your-enemy">Choose Your Enemy</h3>

<p>As stated in the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/01/03/x-com-post-mortem.html">post-mortem</a>, this was a choice between the original alien
enemies of the X-COM games, and the Dreams of Ruin. There isn’t much to say
about the former, as they weren’t chosen and I never developed them beyond this
initial concept.</p>

<p>Choosing the Dreams meant that the initial incidents X-COM was created to
investigate had more to do with traditional horror stories about fairies and
witches than they did with classic UFO mythology. Strange things silhouetted
against the moon, people vanishing into the woods, and a particularly notable
incident where all the medical drugs stored in a hospital in Cologne went bad at
once for no readily apparent reason.</p>

<h3 id="choose-your-leaders">Choose your Leaders</h3>

<p>In response to this, a group of 36 nations founded the Council and pooled their
resources to form X-COM. The idea behind the Council is nice: the nations of
Earth gather together to repel a global threat! The reality is a little darker,
as despite all delegates theoretically having the same amount of decision power,
the richer members contribute with more money and see themselves as entitled to
more influence. The ruling elites of each country also simply cannot resist
using this clandestine military and intelligence organization to handle private
issues that have little to do with aliens.</p>

<p>These negative tendencies are greatly amplified by having the Dreams of Ruin as
the Enemy, since one of their main effects is to amplify negative emotions in
their affected area. From the start I planned to have the corruption in the
Council nations to play an important role in the story.</p>

<p>There were fierce debates among the Council members over who would be its
commanding officer. Sure, they all wanted someone who could get the job done,
but they were also looking out for the interests of their specific
nations. Finally it came down to two choices:</p>

<p>The first was “Mr. Fox”, an American with a long list of shady black ops in his
curriculum, in places like the Middle East and the Balkans. He actually went
missing for years to get away from all that stuff, and they only managed to
bring him back because the fate of the world literally depended on it. He’s
pretty much a Big Boss expy. He has a reputation of taking good care of his men,
recruiting the best and giving them top of the line training. The downside is
that a lot of Council members don’t like him very much, and he has no time to
spare sucking up to them.</p>

<p>The second was “Mr. Smiley”, a well-connected member of the British intelligence
community. He brings from that line of business the idea that human assets are
expendable if it means the success of the mission. As such, his agents are
individually less well-trained than Fox’s would be, but there are more of
them. And his connections mean the Council loves him, in no small part because
he promises to look out for several of its member nations’ private interests. He
is, of course, a George Smiley expy.</p>

<p>In game terms, the players were given the chance to vote for one of the two
candidates. Choosing Fox meant the PCs would be built on 250 points, and would
get extensive drone and robot support once that became available in the tech
tree. It also meant that X-COM would eventually have a nasty falling out with
the Council, due to his inability to stay on good terms with them by playing
along with the corruption present there. As they would still be the only ones
with any real chance against the threat, they would be forced to go rogue.</p>

<p>Choosing Smiley meant that the PCs would be built on 150 points, and would be
part of a larger unit with several other NPCs. The opposition wouldn’t get any
weaker, which meant that unit would almost certainly face significant casualties
when it fought the aliens. Some of their missions wouldn’t involve aliens at
all, but would instead be about doing dirty jobs for one member nation or
another. This X-COM would be very well-funded, but less effective at combating
the Dreams. The “big falling out” here would ideally be between the PCs and the
organization.</p>

<p>Whatever commander they chose would lead X-COM, and the other would vanish from
the game… or so the players thought. The commander they <em>didn’t</em> choose would
go on to form a rogue organization that would make an appearance later. Yes,
this would be a version of EXALT from the 2012 computer game. Or rather,
X-ALT. The hyphens are important!</p>

<p>They chose Mr. Fox, which meant Mr. Smiley went into the cold to form his black
ops squad in the service of those corrupt special interests in the Council
nations. This makes X-ALT a “bad guy” faction.</p>

<h3 id="choose-your-science">Choose Your Science</h3>

<p>The players were similarly given three choices of Lead Scientist for X-COM:
Dr. Moira Vahlen, Dr. Raymond Shen, and Dr. Yuri Sokolov.</p>

<p>The first two were taken straight from the 2012 computer game. Here, Vahlen is a
German doctor and particularly skilled in the biological sciences. Shen is a
Chinese engineer and skilled in robotics. Sokolov, the original character, is a
Russian and also a doctor, but his main area of interest is paranormal
research - no one alive knows more about all those weird Soviet psychic research
programs than him.</p>

<p>Any of the three would be equally adept at leading X-COM’s research efforts, and
their different areas of expertise translated into different “free” starting
technologies as the new lead scientist used the organization’s resources to turn
their previous research into something useful in fighting aliens. Vahlen would
give them advanced medkits; Shen would give them flying scout drones.</p>

<p>They chose Sokolov, who was a bit of a special case. He spends that time
convincing his colleagues that he’s not a useless crackpot, so there’s no
bonus tech… but he turns out to be just perfect for leading research into
Alien Crazy, which in this case means <em>magic</em>.</p>

<p>Unlike the choice of commander, all three scientists are part of the team
regardless, along with a number of other nameless NPCs - this is just to decide
who calls the shots.</p>

<h2 id="step-three-hurry-up-and-wait">Step Three: Hurry Up and Wait</h2>

<p>With all the choices made, X-COM installed itself in its brand new underground
base in the remodeled Cheyenne Mountain complex, and began scanning the skies
for the alien menace… only to find nothing for a whole month. At the end of
that month something remarkable happened, but I’ll leave that for the next post
on this subject. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Today is Valentine’s Day in the US, so this is me making eyes at you. Not that
kind of eyes, though.</p>

<p>In Dragon’s Dogma, the creatures known as Eyes are pure monsters: they have no
natural habitat or ecological niche. They are an expression of corruption from
beyond the Rift, appearing only in places where the world’s veil is thin and
supernatural evil is abundant. While they are living creatures, their forms and
anatomy don’t even pay lip service to normal phisiological principles. Tough
highly intelligent, they never communicate or negotiate, and always try to kill
non-Eyes that run into them.</p>

<p>They come in several varieties, all of which share some of the characteristics
of the Eye of Death found in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 1</strong>, p. 14. In fact, the
Eye of Death could easily be another member of the this monster family.</p>

<p><strong>Update (2017-02-21)</strong>: The Gazer has its own stat block now, and is even
nastier with the addition of a couple more gaze attacks.</p>

<h2 id="vile-eyes">Vile Eyes</h2>

<p>The smallest of the bunch, Vile Eyes look like fleshy spheres with a single
lidless eye always staring ahead. While they are not as agile or perceptive as
an Eye of Death, they share the same death gaze ability and can protect
themselves with a nigh-impenetrable energy barrier. Fortunately for their
victims, they can’t do both of those things at the same time. Switching from the
barrier to one of the other powers and back requires a Concentrate maneuver,
giving the PCs a window in which to hit them.</p>

<p>Unlike their larger cousins described in this article, Vile Eyes are usually
found in small groups. Despite their small amount of HP, they are usually
worthies.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 5; <strong>DX</strong> 10; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> -1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 8; <strong>DR</strong> 0;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 10; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 10</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 5.5; <strong>Move</strong> 5 (Air).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Magic Barrier (-)</strong>: Gives the Vile Eye DR 30 and Magic Resistance 10 while
up.</li>
  <li><strong>Death Gaze (Resisted by HT-5)</strong>: 1d toxic damage. Range 20. Cosmic, ignores
DR.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 5; Dark Vision (Color Vision); Doesn’t Breathe; Doesn’t
Eat or Drink; Doesn’t Sleep; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards; Injury Tolerance (No
Brain, No Neck, No Vitals);</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Elder Thing.</p>

<h2 id="evil-eyes">Evil Eyes</h2>

<p>Not to be confused with Vile Eyes, these things are leathery spheres over three
meters in diameter whose body is dominated by a huge fanged maw that opens to
reveal the central eye. A large number of tentacles protrude from the central
body, each one thick as a human leg and tipped by yet another maw. They are
invariably highly proficient spellcasters in addition to possessing debilitating
gaze attacks and a barrier similar to that of the Vile Eyes. The monster’s
tentacles reach beyond the barrier and thus are always vulnerable, but that also
means it doesn’t need to lower the barrier to attack with them!</p>

<p>Evil Eyes are solitary, and they like to clear out a large, spacious portion of
whatever dungeon or region they emerge in for use as a lair. For all anyone
knows, they just sit there waiting for intruders to kill - stories about Evil
Eye lairs tend to be about mysterious places no one returns from. Very few
people know of the creature’s existence. They are obviously boss monsters.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 35; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 16; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +3; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>DR</strong> 5 (body), 0 (eye, tentacles);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 35; <strong>Will</strong> 16; <strong>Per</strong> 16; <strong>FP</strong> 30</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 5 (Air).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Magic Barrier (-)</strong>: Gives the Evil Eye DR 30 and Magic Resistance 10 while
up.</li>
  <li><strong>Debilitating Gaze (-)</strong>: Works as Dispel Magic cast at skill 20. The target
must also resist with HT-5 or be Stunned for seconds equal to the margin of
failure. Range 30.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (14)</strong>: Damage 4d-2 imp. Reach C.</li>
  <li><strong>Tentacle Bite x8 (16)</strong>: 1d imp, plus the target is automatically grappled
at ST 15. Reach 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Spells (-)</strong>: Any the GM deems appropriate, at skill 20 for Hard spells and
19 for Very Hard ones.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 5; Dark Vision (Color Vision); Doesn’t Breathe; Doesn’t
Eat or Drink; Doesn’t Sleep; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards; Indomitable; Injury
Tolerance (No Brain, No Neck, No Vitals); Magery 5; See Invisible; Unfazeable;
Vibration Sense (Air).</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Elder Thing.</p>

<h3 id="tentacles">Tentacles!</h3>

<p>The Evil Eye’s eight tentacles act as indepentent characters. They have ST and
HP 15, Dodge 10, and attack using the statistics shown on the main Evil Eye stat
block. Once they grapple a target, they’ll attempt to drag them to the Eye’s
maw. Multiple tentacles can cooperate in this!</p>

<p>Damaging a tentacle doesn’t damage the Eye itself. Bringing a tentacle to 0 HP
severs it and takes it out of the fight… but the Eye can spend 5 Concentrate
maneuvers with its barrier down to instantly regenerate all of its tentacles!</p>

<h2 id="the-gazer">The Gazer</h2>

<p>Is this particularly ancient Evil Eye? The progenitor of the whole species?
Something else? No one knows. Its true form cannot exist all at once in our
dimension, but the visible bits are an even larger Evil Eye with an even more
terrible bite. It can use both the Evil Eye’s debilitating gaze and the Vile
Eye’s lethal one at will, as well as cast spells or simply slam victims with its
incredible bulk.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 55; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 16; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

  <li><strong>Bite (16)</strong>: Damage 6d imp. Reach C.</li>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Elder Thing.</p>

<h3 id="even-more-tentacles">Even More Tentacles!</h3>

<p>The main spherical body has no tentacles, but the creature can summon up to 16
of them from rifts that open in the walls or floor <em>and move around at Move
4</em>. Severing a tentacle only means it will be automatically replaced by another
in 2 turns.</p>
