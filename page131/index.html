            <p>I would say it’s time for another State of the Octopus post, but the truth is
I’m late! Let’s get to it already, then.</p>

<p>May saw a whopping 644 sessions from 448 unique visitors to Octopus Carnival,
numbers which are almost twice those of April. This time the US had the clear
lead in the number of sessions, with 304. Brazil came in second with 162. The
others had a slightly higher number of sessions as well, but remained arrayed in
more or less the same positions.</p>

<p>Facebook was still the largest source of referrals at 130 or so, but Google
Plus was close behind it with 128. Looks like announcing posts in a general
roleplaying group there paid off.</p>

<p>Looking at the most accessed pages for the month, we had two individual articles
beat the home page in number of accesses for the first time ever: <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/21/to-gurps-or-not-to-gurps.html">To GURPS or
Not To GURPS</a> and <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/24/alternatives-to-gurps.html">Alternatives to GURPS</a>, a pair of opinion pieces on
when I think it’s appropriate to use GURPS for a game and what I use when the
answer to the first question is “no”. I was very surprised by their popularity,
both in number of views (139 and 133) and in how much discussion they ended up
generating (tough mostly in Google Plus instead of in the article
comments). Note that both of them came out towards the end of the month, too.</p>

<p>I’m very satisfied with the blog’s performance in May, and quite surprised
anyone cares about my opinion :). I hope I can keep the good work going forward.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/209884/Planet-Mercenary-RPG">Planet Mercenary RPG</a> is a space opera game set in the same universe as
the excellent webcomic <a href="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/">Schlock Mercenary</a>. In it, the players take the role
of officers in a 32th-century mercenary company. They take on varied contracts
from all manner of client, human or alien, lawful or shady. Said contracts often
result in a copious amount of explosions with a healthy side order of humor.</p>

<p>This game started out as a Kickstarter project organized by the comic’s author,
Howard Tayler. Being a fan of the comic, I backed it, and it recently reached a
successful conclusion. The PDF can now be bought on the link above for US$25.00,
and overall I consider it well worth the money if you’re looking for a
relatively light and very chaotic action-oriented system. Familiarity with the
comic only makes the whole thing better, but is in no way required for your
group to have a good time with this game.</p>

<h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>

<p>The main text of the book is presented in a double-column layout, in a font I
found easy to read. The page background is white, with light purple margins on
the “outer” side of each page. The page numbers and associated decoration are
done in a “techy” style meant to give the impression you’re reading the text on
some futuristic electronic device. As I have the PDF version, that turned out to
be the actual case!</p>

<p>There’s a fair number of well-done illustrations here, most of which depict
whatever is being currently discussed in the text itself, be it a typical member
of a species, a specific individual, a place or a piece of equipment (from
pistols to warships). The images use a more realistic and detailed style than
the Schlock Mercenary comic, and some of the landscapes done in this style can
be quite spectacular (just look at the cover above).</p>

<p>The text of the book also contains one of the best examples of game fiction I
ever saw. Instead of a short story or comic at the start of the book, this one
is told through a series of editorial notes on its margins. “Planet Mercenary”
is the name of an in-setting corporation that specializes in selling weapons to
mercenary companies, and the RPG itself is written like a piece of promotional
material for them. The editorial notes in question are from the <em>fictional</em>
staff responsible for writing the book, the idea being that they were supposed
to be removed but were left in by mistake. They serve to both add color to some
of the passages in the main text and to tell a story about the characters making
the comments. I was going to say it’s a surprisingly good story for in-game
fiction, but it’s not actually surprising at all given it was written by Howard
Tayler, the comic’s author (who also, IIRC, wrote all the setting information
here).</p>

<h2 id="setting">Setting</h2>

<p>Anyone familiar with the comic should know the setting of Planet Mercenary
pretty well already. Even if you’re not, you shouldn’t have much trouble
understanding the setting with the information included in the book.</p>

<p>Planet Mercenary takes place in our Milky Way galaxy, in the year 3100. Galactic
society is incredibly diverse, encompassing a very large number of alien species
and AIs with intellects ranging from “quite dumb” to “godlike”. All of these
people get into fights with each other often enough that there’s no shortage of
mercenary companies willing to get paid to do fight for them.</p>

<p>Humans have been a part of this hodge-podge for about 900 years, but there are
many species far older than ours out there. Heck, there’s more than a few
<em>individuals</em> older than our species.</p>

<p>The book includes detailed information on several important systems and worlds,
most of which were featured in the comic at some point. There’s also a few
places that are new to this book, and provide new and interesting ways to kill
your PCs even if they’ve read all of the comic already. The descriptions are
humorous, but also succeed in being good space opera on their own merits.</p>

<h2 id="characters">Characters</h2>

<p>Such a wide-open setting can theoretically allow for <em>any</em> sort of game, but
Planet Mercenary helps you out by narrowing the focus to something that should
feel quite familiar to fans of the comic. As mentioned in the introduction, PCs
in Planet Mercenary are officers in one of the setting’s many mercenary
companies. Character creation should be a group effort, since the last step
involves creating the company the characters work for!</p>

<p>The system is almost entirely skill-based. There are no attributes like
“Strength” or “Dexterity”, and stuff that would modify those in other systems
(such as your species) modifies skills instead. There are two derived stats,
Health (which is basically HP) and Defense (how hard you are to hit). Players
begin by picking a Command Package that describes their function in the company,
a Background Package that describes what they did before enlisting, and a
Sophont Type, or species. While the setting has thousands of sophont types, the
book provides details on twelve particularly interesting or common ones, four of
which are actually from Earth (humans are prolific uplifters).</p>

<p>All of these provide you with a set of skill modifiers and one or more
species-specific special abilities. With those in front of you, you then
distribute 40 skill points to round out your character.</p>

<p>With characters in hand, players then create their company by spending Resource
Points, with are the game’s abstraction for large sums of money. They use this
to buy a warship and its controlling AI, and convert the remainder into Supply
Points (i.e, smaller chunks of money) used to outfit the PCs with their
gear. Gear stats are usually quite simple, but they get the job done.</p>

<p>As officers, PCs never go into the field alone. Each is in command of a fire
team of three NPC Grunts, which has simplified stats and acts on the PC’s
orders. They may also be accompanied by a larger, more abstract group of grunts
not under their direct control.</p>

<p>In addition to acting as an extension of your character, Grunts can also act as,
well, Ablative Meat. That’s the actual name of the rule. This basically means a
grunt can take an attack that would normally hit a PC. The more times they
survive the experience, the more detailed their descriptions get!  Losing a
seasoned grunt can feel like losing a friend… but if they stick around long
enough they can get promoted to full PC status when their comanding officer
finally buys the farm.</p>

<h2 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h2>

<p>If the mechanics of Planet Mercenary can be said to have an overall theme, that
theme is <em>chaos</em>. The galaxy is a big, chaotic place and the PCs are expected to
get into messy, unpredictable and often violent situations. Even with the
best-laid plans, anything can happen once the excrement hits the ventilator.</p>

<p>The basic mechanics are simple. Players roll 3d6, add a relevant skill, and try
to get a result higher than a GM-set difficulty, which goes from 7 for
super-easy tasks to 30 for nearly impossible ones. The GM is expected to mostly
eyeball these difficulties - there are no detailed tables of modifiers to be
found here. Combat uses basically the same system, with the target number
usually being the enemy’s Defense. Combat <em>initiative</em> doesn’t use dice at all -
whoever speaks first, goes first. Yes, this makes fights quite lively, and yes,
there’s a fairly large advice section on how to deal with potential problems.</p>

<p>The other thing that really gives Planet Mercenary its unique flavor is the
Mayhem mechanic. One of those three dice should be distinct from the other two
somehow, and is called the Mayhem Die. When a test is successful and the Mayhem
Die has a higher number than the other two, the person who just rolled draws a
card from the Mayhem Deck included in the game and (usually) immediately
resolves the effect described there. There are about a hundred cards, sorted
into descriptive suits such as “Kill”, “Die”, “Bleed”, “Block” and so on.</p>

<p>Mayhem effects can happen on <em>any</em> test, not just in combat! The effects are
pretty varied and described a bit vaguely: the players and GM are expected to
work them into something tht makes sense for the current ongoing scene. Some are
beneficial, some quite detrimental, and most are somewhat ambiguous but
guaranteed to make things more interesting in the Chinese curse sense.</p>

<p>There’s also a “Roleplaying Points (RiPP)” mechanic, which combines with Mayhem
to make things more varied. Players can use RiPPs to re-roll some of all of
their dice in a test, to negate a Mayhem effect, or to invoke the Ablative Meat
Shield rule (see above). The GM, conversely, is expected to hand out RiPPs to
players for good roleplaying and to negate Mayhem cards that would hurt the game
rather than make it more fun.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Planet Mercenary was something of a rarity for me, in that it’s a system I feel
like playing after reading through it. It has enough unique mechanics that it
would be hard to replicate the same “feel” in another system, and it’s very
well-suited to its setting (which I love).</p>

<p>In fact, the Planet Mercenary rule set even has utility <em>outside</em> its home
setting. I can’t think of any other system I would rather use to play in the
Warhammer 40.000 universe. It does <em>Only War</em> better than <em>Only War</em> itself, and
I feel writing psyker rules for Planet Mercenary would be less painful to me
than enduring a whole campaign with that percentile system.</p>

<p>The intrepid soldiers of my <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">X-COM campaign</a> have just completed their second
field op and returned alive but not unharmed. They discovered and explored a
huge Forest of Woe in southeastern Brazil, met a new and more dangerous type of
enemy, and brought back what seems to be an alien defector.</p>

<p>At this point I once again invited the players to step out of character for a
while, and we entered the game’s second strategic/research phase. The bonus
event they got this time was a debriefing of the alien refugee, because Sokolov
was their head scientist. Had it been one of the others, this would have been a
normal research choice and would cost points.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-event-the-refugee">Bonus Event: The Refugee</h2>

<p>The alien is around 1.5m tall, and quite skinny. Its body is covered in a dark
purple, chitinous carapace, over which it wears clothes. It has four arms and
two legs, and moves in a somewhat discomforting and “twitchy” fashion. Its seems
to wear a mask, as there is a clear seam between its face and the rest of its
head, but this “mask” is soft and warm and almost human-like, and moves like it
was a natural face. It’s a strong royal blue in color. The alien’s eyes are
yellow with black pupils, and it has a very pronounced nose. This being does not
have a gender as humans conceive of the concept.</p>

<p>As a genderless alien who wants to come and meet us, it was inevitable that the
refugee would receive the code-name of Ziggy (from David Bowie’s Ziggy
Stardust). Despite Dr. Vahlen’s strenuous protests, Dr. Sokolov elected to
debrief X-COM’s new guest by personally interviewing Ziggy, since it was capable
of communicating in English.</p>

<p>Ziggy’s use of grammar was quite peculiar, and it refused to use the pronoun
“I”. Sokolov soon found out the movements of its mouth didn’t match what it
seemed to be saying, and recordings of the interview only showed it speaking the
same alien language the PCs had heard over their comms multiple times. As a
result, the interviews were all transcribed the old-fashioned way, using the
services of a stenographer.</p>

<p>Ziggy gave X-COM some basic organizational information on their opposition: they
were made up of multiple alien species, some from previously conquered worlds
and some engineered for war. The leaders of this force called themselves the
Ebon Masters, and arrived on Earth through “gates”. The trees were part of a
weaponized, artificial ecosystem it called “The Moon Flower”. Ziggy had been
only a civilian clerk in the employ of the Masters, so he wasn’t able to provide
much in the way of specific strategic detail.</p>

<p>Ziggy also referred to something called “The One Power” several times, and said
none of the species previously conquered by the Masters had such an advanced
mastery of it. Figuring that misunderstanding out quickly revealed that the
advanced alien technology on display so far was, in fact, magic, and that humans
were totally ignorant of it. Ziggy became as fascinated by this revelation as
Sokolov was about the existence of magic.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the alien Masters, Ziggy’s look and culture are a mashup of the
original Ethereals from X-COM and the devils from the
excellent <a href="http://killsixbilliondemons.com/">Kill Six Billion Demons</a> comic. It’s the equivalent of a Blue
Devil, so low-ranked but quite intelligent. Ziggy also has a <em>conscience</em>, which
makes it nearly unique among its species.</p>

<p>The whole “friendly alien helps X-COM” idea sprung from a My Little Pony fanfic,
of all places. That story is <a href="https://www.fimfiction.net/story/100455/stardust">here</a> if you’re curious, and though it becomes
a bit muddled later on its premise was interesting enough that I decided to
recycle it with a more campaign-appropriate alien.</p>

<h2 id="research-options">Research Options</h2>

<p>This time, the players had 2 research points to allocate. Their options were the
following, with the ones in italics being new:</p>

<p><strong>Cutting-Edge Research</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Advanced Medkit (this was Vahlen’s “free” project”) 0/1</li>
  <li>Personal-scale combat drones (this was Shen’s “free” project) 0/1</li>
  <li><em>Project Stardust</em> (Employ Ziggy as part of the research staff and harness the
One Power) 0/2</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Alien Artifacts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Pinnochio (Puppet of Ruin) corpse 0/1</li>
  <li>Rosie (Bakegumo) corpse 0/1</li>
  <li>Alien guns 0/1</li>
  <li>Alien swords 0/1
 -Alien Explosives (from grenades/RPG rounds) 0/1</li>
  <li><em>Black Trees</em> (Study those substantial Black Tree pieces) 0/1</li>
  <li><em>Red Dust</em> (It’s sprinkled over every alien body and artifact, as you’ve
discovered earlier) 0/1</li>
</ul>

<p>The group discussed this for a while. Two new players had joined the group at
this time, and they provided their input as well. In the end, Project Stardust
won out. It was the equivalent of researching psionics in the computer games,
and it was even more vital here than in the original material.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-power-setting-information">The One Power: Setting Information</h2>

<p>What Ziggy called “The One Power” is the ability to cause direct changes to
physical reality by visualizing them in extreme detail and willing them into
existence. It’s called that by the Ebon Masters because they never before had
encountered a civilization that managed to achieve more than a medieval level of
technology without resorting to it.</p>

<p>Ziggy’s description of the theoretical underpinnings of the One Power match a
lot of human occult lore, sharing several similarities with Kabbalah and
Pythagorean numerology among other sources. Manifesting a given effect requires
modeling it through an equation in the alien numerological system, and then
repeatedly solving it in one’s mind. Using it in practice requires more than an
active imagination and skill at mathematics, however!</p>

<p>Medical scans show Ziggy’s body is permeated by an extensive network of
circuit-like metallic filaments, made from the same materials detected in the
tree fragments. These are naturally occurring in every species capable of using
the One Power, according to the alien. These “circuits” act as a conduit for it,
and take on some of the work of processing those mental equations.</p>

<p>Once X-COM’s scientists and engineers figured out the basics of how all of that
works, they realized it wasn’t much different from modeling a physical process
in software. With this knowledge in hand, they were able to separate the steps
of building the necessary model (“compilation”) and running its simulation
enough times to manifest the effect (“execution”). Sokolov didn’t like calling
these things “spells”, so he named them “metatronic loops” to make the whole
thing sound more scientific.</p>

<h2 id="the-one-power-game-mechanics">The One Power: Game Mechanics</h2>

<p>Behind the scenes, the One Power as used by the aliens is basically Ritual Path
Magic from <strong>GURPS Monster Hunters 1: Champions</strong> and <strong>GURPS Thaumathology:
Ritual Path Magic</strong>. The main break from those supplements is that the aliens
are able to use it to create permanent items and constructs, which is where all
the “TL 4+n” stuff comes from.</p>

<p>The bit about naturally occurring “magic circuits” is swiped from the <em>Fate</em>
franchise; their game effect here is to allow a character to buy Magery (Ritual
Path) and Ritual Adept. Humans in this game lack these circuits and so can’t use
“classic” RPM at all. However, this discovery allows them to build similar
circuits into <em>computers</em>, giving them access to the Technomagic variant from
<strong>GURPS Monster Hunters 5: Applied Xenology</strong>.</p>

<p>The immediate game effect of this discovery was to add a new item to the group’s
master equipment list: the Metatronic Device, a hardened, custom-made PDA that
could store one metatronic loop in its memory and run it at the tap of an
icon. The thing’s processor would burn out after the effect ended, but it would
be possible to carry several of them into the field. The first loop available
was one that completely protected everyone in a given radius from the Hostage
Effect (AKA psychic numbness) for up to 6 hours.</p>

<p>Players can also elect to learn ritual magic paths from now on - once they do,
they’ll be able to develop their own loops using the top-of-the-line setup at
X-COM HQ and take them into the field using the PDAs. For now they’re limited to
what the NPC scientists can make.</p>

<p>Another, less visible effect of the discovery was to give X-COM access to the
magical side of every other discovery they made through research! This is why
researching the One Power was so vital - every possible countermeasure for the
Dreams of Ruin involves a healthy dose of magic, particularly the higher-end
ones. They couldn’t arrive at any of those solutions without this knowledge.</p>

<p>Once the choice was made and the effects explained, I took a little time to come
up with their next mission. In the next update to this series, we’ll begin
covering Operation SNAKE OIL.</p>

<p>As always, we’ll be taking a look at how our hypotethical party consisting
of <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/27/pathfinder-df-knight.html">Valeros</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/08/pathfinder-df-bard.html">Lem</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/30/pathfinder-df-rogue.html">Merisiel</a> and <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/15/pathfinder-df-cleric.html">Kyra</a> would fare here as GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy delvers.</p>

<p>“Adventure Path” style modules have a reputation for being extremely
railroady. <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/10/hells-rebels-adventure-1.html">Part 1</a> certainly lives up to that, since it consists of a series
of tightly scripted scenes and two back-to-back dungeons where the PCs have no
real alternative other than delve right in.</p>

<p>In Part 2, however, we leave the rails behind for a bit! It starts by stating
that the PCs plus Rexus and Laria are the group best-positioned to offer
organized opposition to Barzilai Thrune in the whole of Kintargo. It goes to
show how thorough the guy was in killing everyone else, I guess, since right now
our heroes have a snowball’s chance in Hell of taking him down. Before they can
have a shot at The Barzilai, they need to expand the newborn Silver Ravens into
a proper rebel army and consolidate support for their position.</p>

<p>The PCs are expected to engage with the custom rebellion rules at this point,
which means this part of the adventure will play out over multiple weeks of game
time and will largely consist of PC-initiated actions and their consequences as
they focus on recruiting agents and gaining supporters. The book lists several
special events and missions that will happen or become available while the PCs
do this. By the end of the first adventure, the Silver Ravens should become a
substantial movement with broad support among the oppressed of Kintargo, and
should be ready to move out of Laria’s basement and into a more permanent base.</p>

<h2 id="a-spy-among-us">A Spy Among Us</h2>

<p>The events mostly concern Blosodriette, the imp the party has unwittingly
brought from the Fair Fortune Livery along with the documents they recovered
there. She will hang around the hideout either invisible or transformed into a
rat or spider. Her goal is to be set free without being banished back to Hell,
and she begins sabotaging the rebels in an attempt to either convince the PCs to
let her go or to attract attention from outside allies who can free her.</p>

<p>The GM is free to come up with clues and setbacks caused by the imp. Events in
the book go from structural sabotage to mind-controlling an otherwise innocent
NPC into betraying the group to the dottari. The PCs can thwart her in several
ways: finding the contract and ripping it up will send the imp back to Hell, as
will spotting the invisible devil and defeating her in combat. If a PC happens
to belong to the Sarini noble lineage, they can actually <em>command</em> Blosodriette
and turn her to their service, since the contract binds her to that lineage.</p>

<p>It’s probably best if these events are interspersed with the special missions
the book describes later, and/or with the normal turns of the rebellion
management mini-game. Solving each one gives the party a XP award, as does
defeating the imp. Of course, the party might end up finding the imp quite soon,
and all of this will be moot if they already dealt with her back at the
Livery. Defeating the devil early awards the party XP for any events that hadn’t
occurred yet; the party <em>was</em> successful in preventing them, after all.</p>

<p>There’s another unrelated event here that provides a bit of foreshadowing about
the Rose of Kintargo, an NPC who appears in the second adventure. Foreshadowing
is all this is, but I suppose it’s possible for a frustrated party to link
this to the imp’s sabotage instead. It’s something to watch out for.</p>

<h3 id="conversion-notes">Conversion Notes</h3>

<p>Blosodriette should be built as a Wizard with the Shapeshifting, Suggestion and
False Memory spells, plus any pre-requisites and other spells the GM deems
suitably annoying (like summoning swarms of rats). In her natural form, she’s SM
-3. Her advantages include Flight (Winged) and switchable Invisibility as an
advantage rather than as a spell, since she can keep it up for a very long
time. Her disadvantages include Sadism and an Obsession with being freed from
her contract, as well as any vulnerabilities common to demons and devils in your
game.</p>

<h2 id="missions">Missions</h2>

<p>These are “special missions” which occur outside the rebellion management
rules. They’re numbered, but can happen in any order as decided by the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="mission-1-decode-the-documents">Mission 1: Decode the Documents</h3>

<p>Decoding the documents requires skills with Linguistics and fluency in
Celestial, Elven and Strix. Rexus has all of this and will take 7 weeks to do
the job by himself, but PCs who also meet the prerequisites can try to help
shorten this time. Finishing the job in 4 weeks or less is worth bonus XP, and
regardless of the time it takes the party will get a permanent bonus to all
Silver Raven organization stats from the tactical information contained in
there. They’ll also learn a lot about the history of the original group.</p>

<p>Since this is a long-running thing, the PCs can obviously engage in other
activities or missions while it goes on.</p>

<h3 id="mission-2-investigate-the-fires">Mission 2: Investigate the Fires</h3>

<p>A lot of places connected to dissident characters and organizations burned down
in the Night of Ashes, and the PCs can look into those fires if they are so
inclined. The only site that will yield something of value are the ruins of the
Silver Star, Shensen’s shop, which has a hidden stash of potions and scrolls
which wasn’t damaged by the fire. More substantial clues as to what happened at
these locations will be found elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="mission-3-prisoners-of-salt">Mission 3: Prisoners of Salt</h3>

<p>Freeing the high-profile prisoners from Kintargo Castle might be more than what
the group can handle at this point, but that’s not the only place where
prisoners are being held. A group of rogues and mercenaries friendly to Laria is
being held prisoner at the Salix Salt Works, and they would make a good addition
to the Silver Ravens. They’re guarded by a group of thugs hired by Thrune.</p>

<p>The book provides a keyed map of the area, but this will be mostly just a big
brawl. There’s a total of eight CCG Thugs led by a dwarf fighter named Kessrin,
but only half of the group is on guard duty at any one time, with the other half
asleep in an outbuilding. Our hypothetical party should have no trouble at all
moping the floor with these doofuses, particularly if they strike at
night. Rescuing the prisoners allows the PCs to recruit them to the Ravens.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-notes-1">Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>We already discussed the CCG Thugs in Part 1. Kessrin should be built as a
well-armored dwarf Squire with a few extra points of ST, Overconfidence, and the
Throwing skill. He wields a mace and shield, and has a couple of alchemical
grenades. The original uses Tanglefoot Bags, but the GM might want to employ
something more devious like poisons or sleep potions.</p>

<h3 id="mission-4-murders-in-the-nursery">Mission 4: Murders In the Nursery</h3>

<p>Remember how I talked about Golarion having more horror elements than your
typical D&amp;D setting? We’ll get to see some of them here.</p>

<p>You see, tieflings face a lot of racial prejudice in Cheliax, even in
Kintargo. I find this a bit surprising in a nation that generally considers
everything devil-related to be just swell. Perhaps the justification for this is
in a setting book I don’t have. Most of Kintargo’s tieflings live in a decrepit
slum nicknamed “The Devil’s Nursery”, and the harassment they face when they try
to move out makes it very difficult for them to do so.</p>

<p>Thrune made their lives even worse by not only imprisoning the most effective
advocate for their civil rights during the Night of Ashes, but having a witch in
his employ conduct an horrific ritual in the Nursery that summoned a pack of
eight tooth fairies (the <em>Hellboy</em> kind, not the children’s story kind). The fey
roam around the slums every few days, killing people and taking their
teeth. It’s causing a panic that may erupt into a riot if nothing is done about
it. If the PCs help here, they’ll earn many supporters from among Kintargo’s
downtrodden.</p>

<p>This mission is a meaty investigative scenario - all the PCs know at the start
is that people are getting killed in the slums. This might require interviewing
reluctant witnesses, examining a body before the locals can cremate it, or even
having one of the PCs act as bait for the killers by wandering the streets alone
at night.</p>

<p>The fairies fight to the death once they’re cornered in their lair, which is
also where the PCs can find the remains of the ritual that summoned the fairies
here, which include the body of a child. Treating it with respect and solving
the case earns them extra supporters in the coming weeks.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-notes-2">Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>A GM who wants to really focus on the investigation here might break out the
rules from <strong>GURPS Monster Hunters</strong>, which cover the “identify the monster and
find it” part pretty well. Social skills would be useful for interviewing
witnesses, <strong>Diagnosis</strong> for examining the bodies, and <strong>Hidden Lore (Faeries)</strong>
to idenfity the culprits and their weaknesses.</p>

<p>Pathfinder Tooth Fairies are pixy-sized fey (SM -6) who wield magical pliers
that attack like SM 0 magical knives and give them the ability to pull out
someone’s teeth mid-fight. They also have a paralytic bite, and explode into
nauseating glitter when they die. The eight fairies in this encounter can give a
party who relies exclusively on physical attacks some unexpected trouble!</p>

<p>As for our party, this would mostly be Lem’s and Meririel’s show until they
managed to confront the fairies, in my estimation. Fighting them might be tricky
unless Lem can get off a Mass Daze or Mass Sleep spell, or Kyra can set them on
fire.</p>

<h3 id="mission-5-crackdown-at-clenchjaws">Mission 5: Crackdown at Clenchjaw’s</h3>

<p>Clenchjaw’s was a fairly unremarkable bar until recently. Now it’s becoming a
hotbed of anti-government sentment as well as the stage for huge, nightly
brawls. Its owner used to keep a lid on this stuff, but he’s been passing out
early each night for some weird reason. PCs can get involved here while looking
for recruits.</p>

<p>PCs who look hang around the bar long enough will eventually find out the cause
of the increased chaos is Vendalfek, a fairy dragon! He moved here after the
other bar he lived in was burned in the Night of Ashes, and has been using his
illusion powers to make Clenchjaw’s rowdier to stave off his boredom. This in
turn attracted more dissidents to the place.</p>

<p>Vendalfek can be convinced to stop his shenanigans peacefully, and some skilled
diplomacy might convince him to join the rebellion as a special ally. Outright
invinting him to live on their base will have the same result. Failing to
resolve the situation will eventually cause the bar to be raided, which will
cost the Ravens some supporters.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-notes-3">Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>Vendalfek should be based on the Shoulder Dragon template on p. 27 of <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy 5: Allies</strong>, with the addition of some spellcasting ability
focused on illusion. He makes a good spy, being basically a less powerful but
also less ethically questionable version of Blosodriette the imp.</p>

<h3 id="mission-6-an-unsanctioned-excruciation">Mission 6: An Unsanctioned Excruciation</h3>

<p>This section goes on a bit about “excruciations”, which are public torture and
humilation sessions the Chelish government likes to punish its dissidents and
criminals with. Barzilai’s preferred method is “doghousing”, in which the victim
is forced to share a space with two large angry dogs for days and choose between
fighting them for food or starving. No official excruciations are scheduled
during this adventure, but the ever punchable members of the Chelish Citizen’s
Group have decided to perform a few of their own.</p>

<p>This is an event that should happen once the Silver Ravens have gained a fair
bit of notoriety. The CCG captures a friendly NPC who isn’t a member of the
Ravens, perhaps someone who helped the PCs during Mission 4 or 5, and stages a
doghousing in Aria Park. The PCs should get wind of this fairly quickly once it
happens, since it’s not exactly a discreet event. It’s up to them whether and
when to stage a rescue, but waiting too long will obviously prove lethal for the
victim.</p>

<p>Fighting the four CCG thugs and their two big angry dogs would be a literal walk
in the part for our brave delvers. Doing so in a public fashion increases the
Ravens’ notoriety, but I personally think it’s worth it. The dottari show up a
few minutes after a fight breaks out, but by them the party will be long gone.</p>

<h3 id="mission-7-threat-of-the-red-jills">Mission 7: Threat of the Red Jills</h3>

<p>The Red Jills are a small but violent gang of thieves who are taking advantage
of the current chaos to prey on the citizens of Kintargo. They leave the dottari
and the CCG alone, so Thrune lets them keep operating to keep the population
afraid. As such, making them stop will benefit the Ravens.</p>

<p>Recruiting the Jills as allies isn’t possible: they’re led by Scarplume, a strix
with a particularly fierce hatred of humans. Tracking the Jills down to their
abandoned orphanage hideout will lead to a big fight.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-notes-4">Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>Once again the investigation rules from <strong>Action</strong> or <strong>Monster Hunters</strong> would
do a good job here! <strong>Streetwise</strong> and <strong>Area Knowledge (Kintargo)</strong> would be
particularly important for finding the hideout.</p>

<p>Strix are winged humanoids, and their stats should be basically like a human’s
aside from the Flight (Winged) advantage. Scarplume is a sorcerer whose spell
list can be summed up as “All The Fire”, which means she can be statted up as
either a Fire Elementalist or a DF Sorcerer with lots of burning Innate
Attacks. She has Intolerance (Humans) and a host of other sociopathic
disadvantages. The rest of the Jills should be built using the Cutpurse or
Skirmisher templates from <strong>DF 15</strong>, and should all be non-human.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That’s it for part 2 of the book! Part 3 contains a substantial dungeon delve,
but doesn’t necessarily happen after all of the events here: the timing for that
is entirely up to the PCs, so they might end up having to deal with the stuff
here even into the second adventure.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/24/alternatives-to-gurps.html">My Alternatives to GURPS</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>It seems my <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/21/to-gurps-or-not-to-gurps.html">last post</a> on this subject caught more attention than usual! I
got a significant number of comments on Google Plus and Facebook. I honestly
wouldn’t have thought people would be this interested in my opinions. So let’s
elaborate on this a bit more, shall we?</p>

<p>In that post I mentioned that the first system I tend to think of when
I visualize a game in my head is GURPS about 90% of the time. In the other 10%,
something else comes to mind. And in some part of the first 90%, there may come
a time where I decide GURPS is not the best fit either. Why do I end up thinking
that, and what systems I prefer at these times?</p>

<h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2>

<p>Much of my reasoning has been explained in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/21/to-gurps-or-not-to-gurps.html">previous post</a> on this
subject: sometimes the setting assumptions just don’t mesh well with GURPS in
terms of their preferred level of exactness, internal consistency, or sheer
scale. The rest of the time I come to this conclusion is because I know of a
system that can handle what I see as that particular setting’s “essence” better
than GURPS. Usually it’s a mix of the two.</p>

<p>With enough work I could probably modify GURPS into something that can handle
these cases. However, I feel that there’s a point where it’s simpler and easier
to use another system whose design and default assumptions already match what
I’m going for.</p>

<p>Note that this doesn’t have anything to do with the level of “crunch” in a
system! It’s more about the specific feelings I want to evoke in actual play
than about the complexity of the rules.</p>

<p>Here’s some examples from fiction and other media that I feel fit the criteria
above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>By the end of <em>Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</em>, you have the protagonists piloting
a universe-sized robot who uses galaxies as throwing weapons. How to even
begin modeling that?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The joke at the core of Andrew Hussie’s <em>Problem Sleuth</em> is that the exact
game mechanics of the stuff you do don’t matter one bit and trying to properly
understand them leads only to madness. This remains an ever-present theme in
his subsequent story, <em>Homestuck</em>, as well. Despite the jokes some people like
to make, GURPS works in precisely the opposite way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <em>Overwatch</em> campaign that sought to capture the feel of the original’s
<em>gameplay</em> would need a fight between a non-superhuman shirtless dude with an
improvised shotgun and someone wearing the best powered armor German
engineering can build to be an even match. GURPS can’t easily handle that
level of ludonarrative dissonance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything in the entirely non-violent and pastoral <em>Flying Witch</em> happens at
a scale where you could sit down and figure everyone’s DX scores and
encumbrance levels, but that would feel like it’s missing the point of what
the show is really about.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-what">The What</h2>

<p>So what do I usually go for, when I decide GURPS wouldn’t be a good fit? Let’s
look at my usual alternatives in rough alphabetical order:</p>

<h3 id="dungeons--dragons-4th-edition">Dungeons &amp; Dragons 4th Edition</h3>

<p>This is my favorite edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons; Quite possibly the only
edition I actually <em>like</em>. People like to denigrate it as being too
“video-gamey”, but I find its combat system and the power system that supports
it to be immensely fun in a very specific way.</p>

<p>You see, D&amp;D 4 combat <em>does</em> feel like a video-game to me, but not like the MMOs
its detractors usually compare it to. No, to me it feels like a grid- and turn-
based tactical RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics, Fire Emblem or
Disgaea. I love that sort of game to bits, and my fond memories of playing them
stretch back into my pre-teen years. Having an ruleset that allows me to run
something like that on the tabletop is basically a dream come true.</p>

<p>Its encounter and monster design system is easy to use and produces remarkably
consistent results. Monster stats in D&amp;D 4 are mostly independent from the
in-setting description for those monsters. Everything is based on level - the
equipment a monster of a certain level wears and even its basic attributes are
mostly there for color, and can even be safely omitted from the stat block
itself. This makes reskinning monsters to fit your specific scenario a simple
matter of changing your description and maybe switching out a minor power in the
stat block.</p>

<p>I use D&amp;D 4th Edition when I want to experience the feel of its grid-based
combat, and when I want a high level of separation between a character’s game
stats and their in-setting description. That last reason is why I would use this
system for a “gameplay first” adaptation of <em>Overwatch</em>. In a “setting first”
adaptation I would still go with GURPS (and Roadhog vs. Reinhardt wouldn’t be an
even match).</p>

<h3 id="exalted-3rd-edition">Exalted 3rd Edition</h3>

<p>I love Exalted’s setting! I didn’t love the second edition all that much, but
the third won me back.</p>

<p>While I could take this game’s excellent setting and run it as a high-powered
“fantasy supers” GURPS game, I find the original rules have a certain, well,
charm to them. So unless I have a very strong reason not to, when I run Exalted
I use the Exalted 3rd edition rules. I would probably go for a system conversion
before I used the second edition, though.</p>

<h3 id="chuubos-marvelous-wish-granting-engine">Chuubo’s Marvelous Wish Granting Engine</h3>

<p>Chuubo’s is a system as rigorously designed as GURPS, but with a diametrically
opposite focus. While GURPS is all about the mechanical actions and physical
results of character actions, Chuubo’s is all about the intention and the
emotions behind these actions.</p>

<p>This makes it well-suited for pastoral, non-violent games inspired by material
such as <em>Flying Witch</em>. Games where <em>how an action makes you feel</em> is more
important than whether it is successful, and where the climax of the story
consists of <em>witnessing something wonderful</em> rather than overcoming a conflict.</p>

<p>The system also has support for other genres as well, and a large selection of
miraculous powers that truly feel miraculous. It generally excels at running
games where the <em>metaphysics</em> of the setting matter far more than its physics
(such as one based on <em>Homestuck</em>). Its narrative-based XP mechanics are also
quite interesting!</p>

<p>Another system that has very good support for non-violent pastoral games is
<em>Golden Sky Stories</em>. Unlike Chuubo’s, it works at a more prosaic level and
doesn’t try to support other genres, but it’s pretty good at what it does.</p>

<h3 id="wushu">Wushu</h3>

<p>FATE seems to be all the rage these days when it comes to
relatively-rules-light, narrative-driven games, but Wushu is the game that
captured my heart in that area. Its first iterations were dedicated to emulating
kung-fu movies, but it eventually became a generic, action-oriented system that
reaches that status by <em>not caring</em> about the physical details of character
actions. Its very light rules mostly concern themselves with ensuring the group
maintains a coherent narrative, and use that narrative as a means to gather the
dice players roll for actual tests.</p>

<p>This makes it perfect for games where the exact “physics” of the world take a
backseat to the spectacle of the story. <em>Gurren Lagann</em> is the perfect example
of such a setting, and it would also work wonderfully for <em>Problem Sleuth’s</em>
“nonsensical adventure game” paradigm since players would be able to make up
stupid mechanics on the spot as part of their narration.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-you">What About You?</h2>

<p>This is pretty much the list of all of my go-to systems. What are yours? What
specific things draw you to these games?</p>
