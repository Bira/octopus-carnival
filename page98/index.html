            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Now that we have an overview of what Gransys and its settlements look like,
let’s take a more detailed look at a few specific locations in it, starting with
its settlements. Rather than providing an exhaustive list, I’ll describe a few
representative examples using <strong>GURPS City Stats</strong> rules. These will include the
two settlements we get in the original game, but also other made-up
examples. We’ll go by the order in which these communities are discussed in
<strong>GURPS Fantasy</strong>, from smaller to largest. This first article covers villages
and baronies, but it starts with a note on isolated homesteads.</p>

<h2 id="isolates">Isolates</h2>

<p>Gransys is a dangerous place at the best of times, never mind during a draconic
incursion. With all the bandits and wandering monsters prowling around, an
isolated homestead has about the same life expectancy as a snowball in an
oven. Some people still try, though. We find some of these in the original game:
every single one is an abandoned shell that is at best deserted, and at worst
home to the monsters or bandits who emptied it.</p>

<h2 id="villages">Villages</h2>

<p>This is the minimum viable settlement size in this dangerous land. Villages in
Gransys tend to house 200-300 people, living in wooden houses with thatched
roofs. These houses are made so they can be torn down and rebuilt relatively
easily in response to environmental changes or to move closer to
newly-productive land.</p>

<p>Villages have a small chapel of the Faith built out of stone, manned by a single
priest. The chapel’s grounds also contain the village’s graveyard. Villages not
located near a river or stream will have a well.</p>

<p>The vast majority of villagers are farmers, cultivating the land in a roughly 1
mile (1.6km) radius around the village itself. Few villagers travel much beyond
this radius, and even fewer go out further than the manor of their local
lord. Some will be artisans such as blacksmiths and tinkers who are capable of
supplying the village’s everyday needs. Smaller villages might lack even these,
relying on traveling peddlers who make a regular circuit between a set of
villages.</p>

<p>Baronies control about three adjacent villages, with the baron’s manor located
in one of them. Between servants, guards and the baron’s family, manor houses
contain about 50-60 people. Manorial villages also host markets are irregular
intervals, which draw inhabitants from neighboring settlements. Tribute
collectors go forth from the manor once a year to make a circuit of the barony’s
villages. Part of this tribute is sent on to Gran Soren, and part goes to
support the barony itself.</p>

<h3 id="placing-villages">Placing Villages</h3>

<p>The in-game map of Gransys doesn’t leave much room for villages or manors, but
as we already saw it’s compressed by a factor of 10 or so. Using the distances
we figured out earlier leaves plenty of space for these new settlements. Most of
them will occupy the “plains” on the map - stretches of relatively flat and open
terrain. Some will be near forests and occupy themselves with logging and
hunting - the latter especially on the north, which would bring in furs for
trade.</p>

<h3 id="example-grandvine-barony">Example: Grandvine Barony</h3>

<p>Individual villages, especially if they’re peaceful, are rarely interesting
locations to visit. So I cheated a bit for the example and statted up a
three-village <em>barony</em> using <strong>GURPS City Stats</strong>. It’s a little outside the
intended scope of the rules, but the numbers involved are small enough that they
still work out. I’ve also omitted the <strong>Language</strong> entry from the stats, as
we’re not working with multiple languages in this particular adaptation.</p>

<p>Grandvine Barony got this name due to the high quality of its manor’s vineyard,
but that was a long time ago. Located a few kilometers west of the ruins of
Aernst Castle, the barony has been hit especially hard by the bandits who made
the castle their base a few years ago. These ruffians took control of the trail
linking South and Central Gransys, and regularly attack tribute and trade
caravans going through it. They also sometimes raid the barony’s two outlying
villages.</p>

<p>Baron Alecto has a handful of trained soldiers at his disposal, but they are not
numerous enough to face the bandits directly. Combining them with a peasant
militia <em>might</em> work, but either way it would lead to losses he considers
unaceptable. Ser Alexa, his daughter and only heir, is much more
impetuous. Having just completed her knightly training, she wishes to rally the
neighbouring lords, raise the militia, and mount an assault on the ruined
castle. Standing on her way are her father’s concerns and the fact that the
neighbouring lords are much less personally affected by the bandit problem,
being further away from them and not that interested in sending tribute to the
Duke in the first place.</p>

<p>In this post I describe Gransys as a GURPS setting, as it is just before the
start of Dragon’s Dogma. Aside from
the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/03/how-big-is-this-place.html"><em>totally scientific</em> research</a> on its physical size, my
sources are the images and story from the original game, and the many scattered
bits of GURPS material on what a medieval fantasy setting should look
like. These include GURPS Fantasy, the various Low-Tech supplements, and a
couple of Pyramid articles. GURPS Adaptations provides the methodology.</p>

<p>As before, refer to <a href="http://dragonsdogma.wikia.com/wiki/File:Gransys_map_large_w_labels.jpg">the map</a> over at the Dragon’s Dogma Wikia when
necessary. Please note that I made up several of the details below for this
article, so if you find something from the original game or a secondary source
that seems to contradict this description, that’s why.</p>

<h2 id="physical-geography">Physical Geography</h2>

<p>Gransys is a sovereign duchy in an unnamed fantasy world. It’s located in a
peninsula and bordered by several other nations, from which it is separated by
imposing mountain ranges and thick forests. These natural barriers and the sea
define its shape, which bears a vague resemblance to a capital J.</p>

<p>Its southern reaches are warm and relatively flat, with an almost Mediterranean
climate near the coast. They are separated from Central and North Gransys by a
mountain range. As we go north, we see a rise in elevation and a drop in
temperature: Central Gransys is hilly and temperate, with grassy plains and
deciduous forests. North Gransys starts as a large plateau and ends as a series
of windy mountain passes.</p>

<p>The duchy’s largest stretch of forest is the Witchwood in South Gransys. It’s
dense enough that little sunlight reaches its floor, and does contain a swamp in
its furthest depths, but it’s not wet enough to be considered a jungle. Other
notable forests include the Verda Woodlands also in South Gransys, and the
deciduous Cursewood in Central Gransys.</p>

<p>Despite having quite a bit of coastline, Gransys has few sandy beaches. Most of
those are in South Gransys, with the rest of the coasts being made up of
imposing cliffs.</p>

<p>Gransys’ non-monstrous fauna is similar to our Europe’s, including rabbits,
deer, boars, ravens and seagulls. Its <em>monstrous</em> fauna will be discussed in
future posts. Its river and sea waters have plenty of edible fish of all sizes,
though those sailing too far from the coast risk running afoul of sea monsters.</p>

<p>Appropriate Survival specialties for outdoorsy characters would be Plains,
Woodland and Mountains. Those who spend a lot of time in the deep Witchwood
would benefit from Survival (Swamp) as well.</p>

<p>Gransys has normal mana over the vast majority of its territory, as does the
rest of the world. Places where the local mana level varies, if they exist, are
small and isolated.</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p>Gransys’ average Tech Level is what you would expect from a Dungeon Fantasy
game, which means it’s 4 with a few important exceptions. There are no cannon or
firearms, though black powder <em>is</em> known and used in the making of grenades and
other explosives. There is no movable type: written knowledge is disseminated
using the TL 3 method of hand-copying. Literacy is common in Gran Soren and
among priests and nobles, less so among peasants.</p>

<p>The best armor available are elaborate plate harnesses. Shields are also common
even for heavily armored fighters. Though fencing weapons are known, they are
not popular in Gransys.</p>

<p>Unlike standard Dungeon Fantasy, medicine is at TL 4, and is further boosted by
the abundance of potent medical herbs in the duchy. Some of those have innate
magical properties.</p>

<p>Transportation is still at TL 3, with <em>naval</em> transporation barely reaching even
that. Land-based trade routes are preferred over sea-based ones, due to the
large risk posed by sea monsters.</p>

<p>Agriculture is also at TL 3. Gransys farmers grow wheat and harspud, a peculiar
redish tuber rich in nutrients. They also raise cattle. Coastal communities
trawl nearby waters for fish. In both cases, meat is often preserved by
drying. Other crops include fruit like grapes and apples, often used for making
wine and cider.</p>

<h2 id="government-and-society">Government and Society</h2>

<p>As a sovereign duchy, Gransys is ruled by a Duke who answers to no higher
political authority. He is surrounded by a court made up of nobles responsible
for smaller holdings within the duchy and by wealthy merchants who gain
influence from their commercial dealings with the nobles and the Duke himself.</p>

<p>The current ruler is Duke Edmun Dragonsbane, who was crowned fifty years ago
after defeating the Dragon. His legitimacy is entirely predicated on this feat,
as he was a common-born soldier at the time. Despite being at least 70 years
old, he’s still in excellent physical shape. He has Status 7.</p>

<p>There are two <em>counties</em> within Gransys, but they currently exist only on
paper. One covers much of South Gransys and used to be centered on Aernst
Castle, and the other covered the region around where Windbluff Tower now
sits. Their titles are held by Fedel, the Duke’s nephew, and Aldous, the Duke’s
chamberlain, and in practice serve to give them the authority to conduct the
Duke’s business on his behalf. They are status 5. Someone who received the title
of Count and managed to claim the corresponding land would be Status 6.</p>

<p>Those knights given a direct ducal mandate receive the title of <em>margrave</em>, and
this includes those in charge of the three <em>border marches</em> centered around the
Greatwall, Shadow Fort, and Windbluff Tower. These castles are meant to defend
Gransys from monster attack and foreign invasion, and by ducal decree are
supplied from the capital rather than from the surrounding lands. This serves
purposes both practical (the surrounding lands are inospitable) and political
(ensuring the soldier’s loyalty is to the Duke directly), but in practice causes
serious logistics and morale problems. They are Status 4.</p>

<p>There are many smaller <em>baronies</em> scattered throughout the kingdom and
administered from manor houses - most farming villages are technically part of
one such barony. The most influent among these barons usually spend their time
in the Duke’s court and leave a chamberlain to tend to their day-to-day
business. The Duke doesn’t usually concern himself with the affairs of barons as
long as they’re punctual with the tribute. They are Status 3.</p>

<p>Below them are <em>landless knights</em>, who usually serve as part of someone else’s
armed forces. Both male and female knights are called by the honorific
“Ser”. They are Status 2.</p>

<p>Skilled artisans and well-off citizens are Status 1, average urban denizens are
Status 0, and peasant farmers are Status -1. The completely destitute are Status
-2, looked down on by everyone else.</p>

<p>Status is conferred by title or social convention. You are supposed to be
wealthy enought to maintain a lifestyle appropriate to your Status, or to
somehow fake it.</p>

<p>Those who wish to explore Gransys’ stratified society in more detail or make
extensive use of GURPS Social Engineering should give the Status 2+ nobles
Feudal Rank equal to their Status. This Rank would symbolize their official
authority, while Status would be a measure of their social position and
political influence. This would make it possible to have a wealthy merchant like
Fournival from the original game, who doesn’t hold formal Rank in the feudal
hierarchy but has Status 3 or 4. In this model, Fedel and Aldous would have
Courtesy Rank instead of the full version, but would still have the same Status.</p>

<p>If you’re just interested in using Gransys as a backdrop for a Dungeon Fantasy
campaign, then Status and Rank don’t really come into play as advantages.</p>

<h2 id="religion">Religion</h2>

<p>The vast majority of Gransys’ inhabitants follow the monotheistic religion known
as the Faith. Its trappings are quite similar to those of real world
Catholicism, and the god it venerates is called the Maker. It has existed for
centuries, and every village has at least a small shrine or chapel manned by one
or more priests. Gran Soren has a huge cathedral in its noble quarter. There is
also an Abbey in Northern Gransys, home to an order of nuns dedicated to a
humble life of quiet contemplation. The spiritual and administrative center of
the Faith lies outside Gransys, in the mainland.</p>

<p>Ordained members of the Faith go through intense training that ensures they are
quite the adept scholars. Aside from theology, they are well-versed in history,
ancient languages, and other disciplines. Monks and nuns of the Faith seem to
fill a role similar to that of academic researchers in our world.</p>

<p>In addition to the Faith, there are numerous signs throughout Gransys of an
ancient religion practiced in times past. It venerated entities now known simply
as “The Old Gods”, associated with the four elements. Its ruined temples are
buried under the ground waiting for those bold enough to find them. The Faith
regards the religion of the Old Gods with scholarly curiosity, but frowns on
anyone who would consider it more than myth.</p>

<p>Religious Rank in the Faith goes from 0 all the way to 8, but no one in Gransys
has a Rank higher than 4 (the head of the Gran Soren Cathedral). Being an
ordained priest or priestess confers Clerical Investment in addition to Rank,
but brings no supernatural powers. Of course, nothing stops a priest from also
studying magic.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In this Dragon’s Dogma adaptation, I’ve been mostly working from my impressions
of the game itself so far. Recently, though I’ve come accross a video
of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G5o3KhXv6w">this talk</a> by the game’s creator Hideaki Itsuno that sheds some
light into the thought processes behind its gameplay. It does contain some
spoilers, so beware!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://dragonsdogma.wikia.com">Dragon’s Dogma Wikia</a> site also has some setting information that’s
very interesting to me, and even more spoilery than the video. I’ll be using
that as appropriate.</p>

<p>One interesting tidbit from these two sources is that in-game Gransys is
supposed to be around 3 miles across. So, if my experiment from the previous
post is correct, then the in-game map is compressed by a factor of 10. I’ve
always wondered about that.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/29/dragons-dogma-big-picture.html">previous</a> <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/30/adventuring-in-gransys.html">posts</a> I mentioned that the map of
Gransys is “truncated”. We’ll take a look at why that is today. We’ll
use <a href="http://dragonsdogma.wikia.com/wiki/File:Gransys_map_large_w_labels.jpg">this map</a> as a reference in this article. Be warned that it’s a
fully annotated map, so it contains spoilers for the console game! We’ll also
touch on certain story elements that can be equally spoilery.</p>

<p>As you can see, Gransys looks like somewhat like a capital J. It has coastlines
to the south and east, and is surrounded by nigh-impassable mountains on the
other sides. Its southern reaches are temperate and relatively flat, with the
southeastern coast being warm enough that its inhabitants tend to wear light
clothing. The region north of the capital is noticeably colder and hillier.</p>

<p>Looking at the location labels, we see that signs of civilization
are few and far between. Aside from a few castles, there are only two proper
settlements: the isolated fishing town of Cassardis, and the cosmopolitan
capital of Gran Soren. These are the only two places where you can find normal
civilians going about their daily lives.</p>

<p>The reason for this is simple: there are only so many resources to go around
when developing a video game, both in terms of time and money and in terms of
memory, storage and processing power of the target platform. Thus, every place
in the game fulfills a very specific purpose. They’re either commercial hubs,
dungeons, quest sites, or the bare minimum of “wilderness” necessary to give you
the feeling that you’re traveling in a fantasy world. That last bit is why the
map has no scale, by the way.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we are not quite as constrained here! Our imagination has more than
enough space to let Gransys unfurl to its full size. But what size should that
be? To find that out, I took the <em>totally scientific</em> approach of booting up the
game and walking places while timing how long it took.</p>

<p>If you set out from Cassardis at sunrise, you will arrive at the Shadow Fort
shortly before sunset, roughly 25 minutes later<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This means that an in-game
hour passes in around 2 minutes of real time. Assuming my lightly encumbered
Mystic Knight has Move 5, she walked for 12 hours at 2.5 miles an
hour<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. That’s a total of 30 miles, or 48km from east to west. The north-south
dimension, from Cassardis to the Blighted Manse, is roughly 1.6 times as long:
48 miles, or 77km.</p>

<p>That’s smaller than I thought! If Gransys was a modern location with good
roads<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, you might be able to drive across it an hour or less. It’s still
quite larger than its in-game layout would indicate, of course, and those
distances are made all the longer by its medieval tech level. If we follow the
advice spread out through the GURPS material on the topic, there should be a
small village every 5km or so in the most hospitable stretches of land, with
the occasional larger market town linking them into a trade network.</p>

<p>“Small” would mean 100-200 people, organized as either a group of houses working
the fields around them, a group of isolated homesteads, or a single large manor
belonging to a local lord (a landed knight or the equivalent). Most houses would
be made of wood with thatch roofs, and most inhabitants would be peasants and
farmers. They might have blacksmiths and other craftspeople, but are just as
likely to have those needs served by wandering peddlers. Settlements of this
size would dot the plains west and north of Gran Soren, and around the
Eradication Site in Southern Gransys. There would also be a few around the
Encampment, though that stretch of land is quite narrow in the game.</p>

<p>Trade towns would have houses made out of stone with shingled roofs. They would
house their share of peasants and farmers (or fishers!) as well, but would also
concentrate more specialized craftspeople that supply a wider area around the
town and might be able to supply an adventuring party with gear. This would also
be the minimum settlement size where one could find inns and merchants with a
fixed address. Cassardis is one such town and there would be more in the South
Gransys plains and north of Gran Soren. In fact, the spots where you can find
those tiny camps with a peddler and a guard doubling as an innkeeper should
probably be trade towns instead.</p>

<p>The next step up from that would be castle towns, whose farms and trades support
a sizable fortification. Part of the town’s buildings would be built inside the
castle’s walls, and the inhabitants would know to run inside in the case of
attack. Finding armorers and such is much easier here than in the smaller
locations. Castles are run by barons or counts, depending on how large the area
they control is. These would obviously be around the castles we see on the map:
the Shadow Fort, Greatwall, and Windbluff Tower.</p>

<p>The only real big city in Gransys is Gran Soren. It’s home to thousands, it’s
well-fortified, and it contains the most well-stocked stores and the best
craftspeople.</p>

<p>Even small villages are pretty much self-sufficient, and most common villagers
would never travel further than about 10 miles (16km) from their home
village. It makes sense that the fishermen of Cassardis wouldn’t know much about
the Arisen! Some people are a fair bit more well-traveled or cosmopolitan than
that, like the nobles who send you on quests all the way across the duchy or the
NPCs who ask to be escorted to those same places. Most news from “outside” are
likely to come from these bold souls, or from similarly bold wandering peddlers.</p>

<p>That gives us a pretty nice canvas to work with! In future posts, we’ll go a bit
deeper into Gransys’ society and notable settlements, with attending GURPS
stats.</p>

            <p><strong>Update</strong>: This is the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy version of the character. If you
want to see a version for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG, click <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/25/pathfinder-dfrpg-barbarian.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>As I write this, I noticed that we’ve had a handful of GURPS posts already and
none of then has included any GURPS stats yet! I’ll try to remedy that
here. Since it might be a while until I have concrete rules to show for the
Dragon’s Dogma project, I’ll go with something completely different for this
post.</p>

<p>As you might know, Steve Jackson games recently completed a very
successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/847271320/dungeon-fantasy-roleplaying-game-powered-by-gurps">Kickstarter campaign</a> to finance the production of a
standalone Dungeon Fantasy boxed set. This gets me in the mood to do something
DF-related. Following the general Octopus Carnival theme of “adaptations”, I
decided to adapt the Pathfinder Iconic characters to GURPS Dungeon Fantasy. From
what I can see, each of the originals is meant to both be a representative of
their character class in the Pathfinder setting and to have a unique gimmick
that helps individualize them. This should be just the right amount of
complexity to illustrate what DF can do, as well. I’m sure a lot of people have
done the same conversions in the past, but these will be <em>mine</em>.</p>

<p>I’ll take each of the DF templates from <em>Adventurers</em> and use them to recreate
the Pathfinder Iconic of the corrresponding class. We’ll pull material from
other books as necessary to cover that character’s distinctive style. This
should limit the complexity of the conversion while still providing an
interesting exercise. The end result might not have the same mechanic “feel” of
the original, but that’s a feature in our case: it will be a Dungeon Fantasy
character, not a Pathfinder character. I’ll try to comment on any notable
differences. Please also note that I’ll be using the current line of GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy PDFs, not the boxed set, which is still a few months away from
publication as of this writing.</p>

<p>The first template listed in the book is Barbarian. Therefore, our first
converted iconic is Amiri:</p>

<p>Amiri’s full official bio and character sheet can be
found <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/amiri.html">here</a>. Judging from those, we can glean a few facts about her:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Amiri is good at outdoor survival in cold climates, since she returned from a
“suicide” scouting mission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amiri is of normal human size, but fights with an oversized sword that used to
belong to a frost giant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She’s fiercely competitive and doesn’t like being outdone at barbarian
heroing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She relies a lot on the d20 Barbarian Rage power when fighting, and might get
angry enought to lose her mind. In other words, the purpose of Amiri is to
flip out and kill people.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s how I think she should look like in GURPS:</p>

<h3 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h3>

<p>Amiri spent 2 points in extra starting cash so she could purchase the big
sword.</p>

<p>Unlike the standard DF 1 Barbarian, Amiri lacks Gigantism, and thus is
SM 0. While I know there’s a “Short Barbarian” option in Dungeon Fantasy
Denizens 1: Barbarians, I don’t own that book and thus simply decided to remove
Gigantism from her character sheet and adjust the point costs accordingly.</p>

<p>Most of her discretionary advantage points went into the Huge Weapons perk that
allows her to wield the sword without penalty, and the Great Rage advantage from
DF 11: Power-Ups. Note that these normally require Gigantism - I waived this
particular prerequisite here.</p>

<p>Taking all of that into account, we have a perfectly playable DF character that
hits all the same points as the original from Pathfinder! In campaign play, good
choices when spending experience would be buying Combat Reflexes, the second
level of Great Rage, ST and weapon skills to make Amiri a better combatant, or
Absolute Direction along with more and higher Survival specialties to make more
skilled in surviving the wilderness.</p>
