          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/04/10/fighter-shoots-itself.html">I Learned Something About Fighter Planes</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I’ve been playing a lot of Ace Combat 5 and 7 lately, so I have fighter jets in
the brain. And today I learned something I’d never have thought was possible
from looking at the way those games or RPGs like GURPS model them.</p>

<p>Apparently, modern fighter planes are so fast they can shoot <em>themselves</em> down
by outrunning their own cannon fire! Implausible, you say? Well, if you read
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/04/dutch-f-16-takes-cannon-fire-from-itself/#p3">this bit of news</a> you’ll see that it actually happened in January of this
year with an F-16, and that there are records of at least one other incident
from back in 1956 with a Grumman F-11.</p>

<p>The gist of it is that shells are fired from the aircraft’s cannon at a speed
equal to that of the aircraft plus their muzzle velocity, as you’d
expect. However, they’re quickly slowed down by drag, so it’s possible for a
plane flying at high speeds to accelerate past the bullets it just fired and
maneuver itself into a position to be hit by them.</p>

<p>GURPS and most RPGs just tend to treat projectiles as having infinite speed. A
character shoots, and the bullet flies out to its maximum range before the end
of that character’s turn. This is a pretty decent approximation for the type of
combat that usually happens in these games, which is between people on foot and
at relatively short ranges. <strong>GURPS Tactical Shooting</strong> does have some
additional rules for projectile flight time, but those are optional and mostly
meant for snipers<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. None of the existing rule sets contemplates the speed and
ranges involved in jet age air combat.</p>

<p>Do we need specific rules for this hazard? I would say not. It’s even more of a
niche situation than long-range sniping, and the bookkeeping required to track
it would not be all that fun even in a realistic game about air combat. No, what
we have here is an <em>excellent</em> result to use if someone rolls a critical failure
on a Gunnery or Pilot test. Even if you go on to become the Ace of Aces, your
squadron-mates will forever embarass you with stories of that one time you shot
yourself down.</p>

<p>Today’s monster is the Battlebriar, a plant creature that’s entirely new to
me. It exists only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Battlebriars are weaponized biotech! These plant monsters were created to serve
as living siege engines. A direct quote from the book: “They can destroy massed
formations of lesser troops, storm defended embankments, or bring down
fortifications.”</p>

<p>Being plants, these living engines of destruction are surprisingly
low-maintenance. As long as a battlebriar has access to water, fertile soil and
sunlight, it can live forever. This makes them good guardians in addition to
being siege weapons. Fey creatures like to use them to guard their
strongholds. Other battlebriar users include Hill Giants, which I found quite
interesting. Sometimes they also escape their masters and go live in the wild.</p>

<p>Battlebriars are Unaligned and have Int 3, so PCs are most likely to fight them
when going against their masters. A wild battlebriar will likely leave the PCs
alone if they don’t provoke it, though of course they might have no alternative
if it’s blocking their goal.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We’re given two stat blocks for these things.</p>

<p>The <strong>Warthorn Battlebriar</strong> is a Large natural animate (plant), and a Level 14
Controller with 141 HP and a ground speed of 6. It has an aura of Grasping
Thorns, with a 2-square radius, that makes its area difficult terrain for
enemies and deals 5 damage to any that start their turns there. This thing has
dozens of branches constantly flailing around!</p>

<p>Aside from a reach 2 claw as a basic attack, it can also fire thorns from those
branches in a close burst 2. This targets Reflex, dealing damage an slowing
targets for a turn. Furthermore, its claw attacks pull victims towards the
monster. Getting away from this thing is quite hard: you’re slowed, in difficult
terrain, and when you manage to get away it pulls you back. It also has
threatening Reach, and so can make opportunity out to its full reach of 2
squares.</p>

<p>Its big brother is the <strong>Earthrager Battlebriar</strong>, a Huge elemental animate
(plant). It’s a Level 28 Elite Brute with 634 HP, a ground speed of 8 and a
<em>burrow</em> speed of 6. It’s made out of vines rather than thorny brambles, so its
3-square aura pulls enemies towards it. It’s the Reach 3 claws that do the
slowing. It also has threatening reach, and it can trample - that last bit is
how it attacks several characters at once.</p>

<p>It resembles the Tarrasque in its tactics when on the offensive. When used as a
guardian, it burrows and uses tremorsense to detect intruders, erupting below
them to fight.</p>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 14, a Warthorn being used as a weapon by a
party of 2 cyclopes and 3 hill giants.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Living siege engines are always cool, and these are nicely thematic for fey or
elemental Earth-themed opposition. I liked them. Like every other MM monster,
they need the damage fix, but other than that I see no fault with them. I like
that their abilities match their in-world roles. The warthorn is your infantry
killer, and the Earthrager with its burrowing and trampling ability makes short
work of castles and walls.</p>

<p>The Earthrager is the sort of weapon a mortal or fey army would round up to
fight the Tarrasque… or, since it’s elemental, it might itself be a prototype
or herald for the Big T.</p>

<p>Welcome back to Let’s Read Hell’s Rebels! On <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/01/28/hells-rebels-2-part-3-part-1.html">our last installment</a>, the PCs
explored the underground base under the ruins of the Lucky Bones casino and
cleared out a nest of diabolic cultists, but all of that only covered <em>half</em> of
the first level of the dungeon. Here we’ll go through the other half.</p>

<h2 id="lucky-bones-haunted-opium-den">Lucky Bones: Haunted Opium Den</h2>

<p>The Haunted Opium Den occupies the northern half of the level 1 map. It shares
the same basic traits: 8-foot tall walls, pervading moisture, swollen and stuck
doors. The main difference is all the doors here are closed, there’s no
illumination, the temperature is just above freezing, and the mournful moans of
lost souls echo through the hallways. In other words, it’s obviously haunted.</p>

<p>The party can access this sub-level through the door on <strong>C7</strong>, which as
mentioned <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/01/28/hells-rebels-2-part-3-part-1.html">before</a> is protected by a complex lock and an arcane ward. PCs
with the right spells and skills just might be able to get through it on their
own. Otherwise Octavio can hook them up with an NPC spellcaster to break the
seal once the cultists are cleared. “Lucky” PCs might also find a secret passage
in the hideout that leads to the bottom of a pit in this region, right into a
faceful of yellow mold.</p>

<p>Our opposition here consists entirely of undead haunting the places where they
died or guardian creatures bound by sorcery. Since no one leaves their assigned
rooms, there’s much less pressure to finish this area in one go than there is
for the hideout. Two of the encounters (Lorelu and the wretchghosts) can even be
avoided if all the party wants is to make a beeline to level 2, but all the
undead in this area must be dealt with eventually before the complex becomes
usable as a base.</p>

<p>Here’s the room key:</p>

<p><strong>C10. Private Rooms:</strong> Accessible from C7. Fancy furniture rotted by time and
moisture. Each contains a valuable hookah still in good condition.</p>

<p><strong>C11. High-Stakes Hall:</strong> Accessible from C7. Large card table with several
seats. The corpse and ghost of Guildmaster Lorelu are here. The ghost will
invite the PCs for a few “friendly” games of Odds and Evens. See below for
details on this.</p>

<p><strong>C12. Opium Den:</strong> Accessible from C7. Squat columns, claustrophobic curtained
alcoves. Three wretchghosts (see below) haunt this room and attack the living on
sight. Their corpses lie here and are loaded with fancy jewelry.</p>

<p><strong>C13. Infested Pit:</strong> Accessible from C7. An obvious, 20-foot deep pit. Rotten
rope-and-pulley device across it will crumble if anyone tries to use it to
cross. Narrow ledge on south side allows passage with an easy Acrobatics check
(DX in GURPS). Northern ledge looks similar but hinges down like the ones in C4
to drop people into the pit. The bottom of the pit contains the skeleton of a
giant snake and a whole lot of yellow mold. It also has a secret passage leading
to C4. PCs coming in from the other side of this passage for the first time will
also be exposed to the mold.</p>

<p><strong>C14. The Watcher In The Walls:</strong> Accessible from C13. Floor tiled in odd
patterns of red, green, blue and yellow tiles. A bound advanced xorn waits in
the walls and will attack anyone who tries to cross the room without stepping on
tiles of only one color (Lorelu can reveal this information). Yellow tiles
contain secret compartments (single Perception/Observation test to notice them
all) full of stolen money and jewelry. The corpses of two opium den clients
killed by the xorn contain yet more jewelry.</p>

<p><strong>C15: Master’s Office:</strong> Accessible from C14. Large conference table, filing
cabinets lining the walls, moldy portraits of all three guildmasters. A bunch of
coins and a <em>dagger of venom</em> are on the table. The files contain a lot of
obsolete ledgers, a bunch of deeds for property in Vyre that will be useful in
the next adventure, and a poem with a circled passage that will be useful in
C16.</p>

<p><strong>C16. Smuggler’s Well:</strong> Accessible from C14. Heavy battle damage on walls, old
skeletons belonging to Grey Spiders and Torrent Knights. Six ghasts lie amid the
inert skeletons. There’s a big well in the center, capped by a heavy stone slab
decorated with a xenopterid statue with gemstone eyes (looks like a man in a
trenchcoat from a distance). Pressing the eyes in the sequence circled in the
poem found on C15 causes the stone to slide and open the way to level 2. The
wrong sequence or any attempt to destroy the capstone summon a fiendish
xenopterid that attacks the party. Only one such beast can be summoned at at
time, but this keeps happening until the party gets the sequence right or
manages to fully destroy the stone. Treasure includes scattered coins, jewelry
worn by the ghasts, a <em>+1 mithral short sword</em> and a <em>vest of escape</em> amid the
bones.</p>

<h2 id="opposition-notes">Opposition Notes</h2>

<h3 id="lorelu">Lorelu</h3>

<p>If the PCs win a round against the halfling ghost, she answers a question from
them. If she wins, the gets to drain a bit of the opponent’s life. The rules for
Odds and Evens are at the start of the adventure book, initially presented as a
harmless game you can play back at the Tooth and Nail. I think I glossed over it
when describing that tavern, but it’s a nifty bit of foreshadowing when you know
what it’s for.</p>

<p>Lorelu remembers little of her life but has fairly good knowledge of the
dungeon’s layout, traps, and current events - even stuff from the second
level. Her answers are true but somewhat cryptic, and if she doesn’t know the
answer to a question “I have no idea” is valid as far as the game is
concerned. The life drain she employs on a loser causes damage to a random
ability score.</p>

<p>The list of things that will make the halfling flip out and attack the party is
quite long: disturbing her remains, displaying symbols of the Order of the
Torrent, winning more than eight games, getting caught cheating, and of course
picking a fight.</p>

<p>Lorelu is a classic D&amp;D ghost, meaning she’s insubstantial, has a monstrously
damaging spectral touch, can drain life as described above, and layers all of
that on top of the abilities she had in life as a level 6 rogue. Yes, the
spectral touch can be used for sneak attacks. Fortunately for the party, she
will not pursue them beyond the door and “resets” to a friendly attitude when
they go back in. The one way to destroy her for good is to expose her bones to
sunlight. If the PCs think to ask her about that, she will let them take her
remains to the surface and will no longer attack.</p>

<h3 id="wretchghosts">Wretchghosts</h3>

<p>Wretchghosts are a new monster described in this book. As you might expect,
they’re the ghosts of people who died from withdrawal. They’re associated with a
specific drug (opium in this case), and their touch can get people addicted to
it. They have bonuses against people addicted to the same drug as themselves,
but these people can also bypass their insubstantiality and resistances.</p>

<p>On the one hand, these former customers of the opium den were nobles and rich
merchants, so their corpses have plenty of jewelry. On the other, a few of the
PCs are likely addicted to opium after the fight ends.</p>

<p>No mention whatsoever is made of special ways to get rid of this condition, so I
guess it has to be cured the old-fashioned way. The ghosts can also use some
spell-like abilities conceptually associated with opium, and go berserk when in
the presence of the drug. You can have wretchghosts associated with other
substances too, by switching their spell-like abilities.</p>

<p>The “you’re now addicted” bit could really suck in GURPS, since Addiction there
is a significant disadvantage and getting rid of it involves spending quite a
few earned character points. Kinder GMs might wish to make it follow standard
Affliction rules and have it only last for a few minutes of cold-turkey agony,
or make it “permanent” but curable by Remove Curse.</p>

<h3 id="other-opposition">Other Opposition</h3>

<p>Ghouls have official stats on Pyramid #3/108. Increase their attributes a bit if
you want to be strict about them being <em>ghasts</em>. They’re the last of the trapped
customers to die here, having reached the battle site and resorted to
cannibalizing the corpses before they finally starved.</p>

<p>Xenopterids are Pathfinder’s version of the Moth Man legend. Man-sized bugs who
look like people in trenchcoats from a distance, with sharp claws and a natural
talent for grappling. They claw, they bite, they have venom, they drain blood,
they have tough shells.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Pathfinder doesn’t always manage to straddle the line between atmospheric and
tasteless, but I think it managed it here.</p>

<p>The Lorelu encounter is practically combat-free for a perceptive party. That’s a
lot more than I expected from the game that uses “attacks on sight and fights to
the death” unironically. As for the other monsters, I particularly liked the
wretchghosts. It’s fun to come up with new varieties of them for all the weird
fantasy drugs in your world.</p>

<p>Hitting the Haunted Opium Den early might not be a good idea even for parties
who can get through the door on their own - they’ll need to conserve their
resources for the boss fight at the Cultist Hideout.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/03/22/bat.html">Where I read the 4e Monster Manual/Vault: Bat</a>

<p>Bats are tiny nocturnal mammals who feed on fruit and insects… but those
aren’t the bats we’re talking about here. These bats are proper monsters.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>We get two different bat species here. Both are Medium, meaning they’re the size
of an adult human and have enough wingspan to get that bulk airborne.</p>

<p>Fire bats are Elemental Beasts (fire), which are native to the Elemental Chaos
but spread to the world through natural passages between the two planes and took
root here. In much the same way cats migrated to Australia on ships and became a
danger to the ecosystem, I guess.</p>

<p>Shadowunter bats are apparently native to the world. They’re descended from
normal bats who happened to live in places where necromantic energies from the
Shadowfell leaked through, and those energies mutated them.</p>

<p>Both types of monstrous bat have Int 2 and are Unaligned. They take well to
domestication, and so might be found as pets and guard animals for people or
intelligent monsters, particularly those that share origins with them. In fact,
the Fire Bat lore entry specifically mentions azer, which gives credence to my
theory that the azer used to be Heroic-tier opponents who got upgraded to
Paragon at the last minute.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Organizing monsters alphabetically by name means Bats are actually the first
real Heroic-tier creatures we’ve run across in the book. Angels had an
Heroic-tier variant but it was kind of a footnote among a bunch of more powerful
individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Shadowunter Bats</strong> are Level 3 Lurkers that have 38 HP and fight as
skirmishers. They’re quite clumsy on the ground, but fly with speed 8. It
appears they attack with a wickedly barbed tail, which has a bonus to attack and
does extra damage in dim light or darkness. They can use it in a Flyby Attack,
moving their speed and making a tail attack at any point (and not provoking
opportunity attacks when moving away).</p>

<p>Hm… if one or more of these attack the party, I’d expect them to do so in an
area that’s entirely shrouded in dim light or darkness. You’d think that this
would allow them to get the bonus damage all the time, but PCs are likely to be
carrying their own bright light sources in these places. So they’re going after
the rogue who’s scouting ahead without a light source. If domesticated, their
owners should probably employ some trick to neutralize the party’s lights.</p>

<p><strong>Fire Bats</strong> are Level 3 Skirmishers with 60 HP and 10 fire resistance. They
fly as fast as shadowunters, and are as clumsy on the ground. Being bats that
are on fire, their attack is a touch that does fire damage and ongoing fire
damage. Their version of the flyby attack allows them to shift 4 squares and
make an attack against anyone they touch on the way.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 3, a party of goblins and their two shadowhunter
bat pets.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Functional opposition for when your party ventures into bat country. I think the
fire bats work a little better, since the shadowunter’s bonus damage is too
fiddly. Changing it so that they only need to <em>start</em> their turn in dim light or
darkness to get the bonus would make them work better.</p>

<p>Since they’re only level 3 regulars, the math bug doesn’t affect them all that
much.</p>

            <p>Steve Jackson has another kickstarter for DFRPG going! While the main goal for
this one is the creation of a second monster book for the game, they’ve also
bundled in the costs of reprinting the wonderful physical box set for the
original game.</p>

<p>You see, they’re using this particular campaign as a way to gauge player
interest in GURPS. If it funds successfully, they’ll commit to doing “big” books
for the GURPS as a whole in the future. If it doesn’t, then support will
continue only in the form of small PDF supplements, one or two a month.</p>

<p>By the look of things, the project <em>will</em> fund, but only just. So if like GURPS
and haven’t thought about pledging to it yet, go to the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/warehouse23/powered-by-gurps-dungeon-fantasy-monsters-2-and-ga">campaign page</a> and
do it! For only US$10 you’ll get the PDF of the new book, and there are pricier
options for people who want physical copies or other books as well.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t play DFRPG specifically, you’ll still get some mileage out of
a bestiary, which is the sort of book people always complain is missing from
GURPS. And if you <em>do</em> play it, then what you have is a win-win situation right
there.</p>

<p>If you have no idea what GURPS Dungeon Fantasy is all about (unlikely, if you’re
reading this blog), you can see this <a href="http://www.gamesdiner.com/2019/03/31-reasons-why-you-want-to-pick-up-dungeon-fantasy-roleplaying-game-and-fast">excellent post</a> with no less than 31
reasons why it’s awesome.</p>

<p>The PDF of the game itself is available at <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/products/dungeon-fantasy-roleplaying-game">Warehouse 23</a> for US$40 (you have
to choose PDF in the format dropdown there). Forty American dollars might sound
like a lot, especially if you’re reading this in Brazil, but this is actually
less than the price of a single D&amp;D core book. And it gives you a full fantasy
game that’s better than D&amp;D (yes, I went there)!</p>
