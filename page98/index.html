<p>While the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/22/equipment-part-1.html">previous post</a> gives you a pretty complete picture of the gear
available to Gransys adventurer’s, there’s one aspect left to cover that can
really bring that Dragon’s Dogma feel: equipment upgrades. Obviously, these
rules can also be used to good effect in generic <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> games.</p>

<h2 id="upgrades-in-the-original-game">Upgrades in the original game</h2>

<p>The original game not only has a very extensive selection of equipment, it also
allows the player to <em>upgrade</em> each of those items. Certain weapon vendors can
apply from one to three upgrade levels to a weapon or a piece of armor. Each one
increases its damage or protection value and decreases its weight. This both
costs money and requires “special components”. More often than not, that means
<em>monster parts</em>, though some might require specific types of ore or
miscellaneous items like buckets and sconces instead. It’s unclear whether these
upgrades are a mundane or magical process.</p>

<p>In addition to this, when the player kills a dragon there’s a chance that their
equipment may be “Dragonforged”, which improves it beyond what’s possible with
the normal upgrades. These and the further alchemical “refinements” possible in
the <strong>Dark Arisen</strong> expansion are definitely magical. They also have a nice
mythic resonance!</p>

<p>The game does still have a sizable selection of weapons of increasing
effectiveness that’s common to most electronics RPGs. Sometimes it’s better to
trade up to a better weapon, and sometimes it’s better to keep upgrading the one
you have. Generally, though, you want to keep getting better weapons until the
very end of the game, when you pick a high-level set that has the abilities you
want and max their upgrades out.</p>

<h2 id="designing-the-upgrade-system-for-gurps">Designing the Upgrade System for GURPS</h2>

<p>We’ve seen what the system in the original game looked like. Does something like
that have a place in the tabletop version? If so, can we implement it without
needing to come up with a detailed list of monster parts required for each of
the hundreds of entries in GURPS’ gear books?</p>

<p>The “upgrade pattern” for weapons and armor in <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>
resembles the end-game pattern for Dragon’s Dogma from the start. PCs either
start with their preferred weapon and armor types, or acquire them very soon
into the game, and from that point on they seek to improve either the <em>quality</em>
or the <em>enchantments</em> in their gear.</p>

<p>The big difference here is that “upgrading” a piece of gear in DF means
replacing it with an entirely new piece that was either bought in town or found
in a dungeon. You can’t really add better quality descriptors to a given item,
which is realistic. And while you <em>can</em> add or replace enchantments to a magic
weapon by the rules, in DF the best magic is usually found as dungeon loot. When
that happens, it’s better to use the new item than to cling to the old one.</p>

<p>An upgrade system should challenge that assumption. It should give PCs the means
to improve both the quality and the magic of a given piece of gear without
having to replace it. It should give them tangible benefits for choosing this
route over the traditional one, but it shouldn’t be so good that replacing gear
is never a feasible option.</p>

<p>One benefit of an upgrade system is that an upgraded item <em>is still the same
item</em>. This gives players a little more incentive to invest in Signature Gear,
Weapon Bond, or Armor Bond without fear that the points spent in these perks
will be wasted. Another benefit is that it can be slightly cheaper to upgrade an
item if the player can meet the necessary conditions.</p>

<h2 id="the-upgrade-system-gransys-alchemy">The Upgrade System: Gransys Alchemy</h2>

<p>As we said in previous posts, enchantment in Gransys isn’t the province of
wizards. Instead it’s an expression of mastery in artisanship, borrowing from
the old belief that each artisan learned the secret magic of their own
profession as they progressed in skill. It’s a lot more similar to alchemy than
to standard spellcasting - through knowledge of these secrets, an armorer can
<em>refine</em> a weapon or suit of armor and get it closer to its platonic ideal.</p>

<p>These secrets are jealously guarded, and usually the province of NPCs. Anyone
who knows them is more than able to make a comfortable living without needing to
mess with dungeon-delving! Some of these processes do require rare ingredients
only found in dangerous places, but that’s what adventurers are for.</p>

<p>This means that PCs with access to a skilled artisan can improve the quality of
their weapons and armor by paying the difference in cost between the initial and
final state of the item. Add up the CF of the desired options and multiply that
by the item’s base cost.</p>

<p>Adding <em>magical</em> enhancements to an item follows a similar process, though only
those enchantments marked as available for sale in <strong>DF 1</strong> can be added in this
way. Simply total up the cost of the enchantments you wish to add. Adding a
better version of an existing enchantment (say, Puissance 2 to a weapon that
already had Puissance 1) does <em>not</em> grant a discount! The old enchantment is
simply lost.</p>

<p>The number of master artisans capable of imparting more powerful magic into an
item can be counted on one hand. They all seem to have paid some unspeakable
price for their knowledge, and either live in remote places surrounded by
danger, make outrageous demands of potential customers, or <em>both</em>.</p>

<p>Only half of the upgrade cost represents the artisans’s wages. The other half
represents the materials and alchemical components required for the process. The
PC can provide them directly to the artisan instead, thus saving some money in
exchange for the time spent and the risks taken in finding them. The more
extensive an upgrade, the greater the chance the artisan simply doesn’t have the
necessary materials in stock, which means the PCs <em>must</em> go out and find them.</p>

<p>As we’re dealing with sympathetic magic and not with mundane craftsmanship,
these materials take many surprising forms. Aside from the metallic ores you
might expect, upgrading a given weapon might require things like crystals, rare
flowers that only grow near active volcanoes, or hydra gallstones.</p>

<p>Somehow, it seems this stuff is never found just lying around in a peaceful
meadow. Mineral ragents require rolls against <strong>Prospecting</strong> to find and
extract. Rare plants require rolls against <strong>Naturalist</strong> or <strong>Herb Lore</strong> to
identify and harvest. And monster parts require combat skills and everything
listed under <strong>Dead Monster Bits</strong> in <strong>DF 2</strong>, p. 13. Alternatively, if you
have <strong>DF 19</strong> you can use <strong>Professional Skill (Dungeon Butcher)</strong>.</p>

<p>Each component contributes a certain monetary value towards the upgrade of an
item, determined by the GM. Better components are more difficult to find and
usually heavier. This table can act as a guide:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Quality</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Basic</td>
      <td>$300</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Good</td>
      <td>$1000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fine</td>
      <td>$3000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Legendary</td>
      <td>$10K or more</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Note that the value listed above is <em>only</em> for the purposes of contributing
towards upgrading a given item. PCs who go around harvesting random generic
components for sale can expect to get around 5% of that price or less for
anything less than Legendary components. Legendary components are never random
or generic: they’re treasure!</p>

<p>There is no fixed table of what each component requires. The GM is free to
either come up with a fixed “shopping list” on the spot for each process, or let
players present their own with justifications as to why they fit. If the GM
judges a particular component is particularly resonant with the item being
upgraded, they can have it count as a higher category.</p>

<p>At the GM’s option, PCs seeking only relatively minor upgrades can simply pay
the full cost in money - either the process didn’t require any special reagents,
or the artisan had them on hand already.</p>

<h2 id="example-ser-alexas-family-sword">Example: Ser Alexa’s Family Sword</h2>

<p>Ser Alexa wants to turn her decrepit family blade into a weapon worthy of an
hero. While she could perhaps afford a new sword, she wants to use this one to
rid her barony of bandits. It’s the sword she trained with as a young squire,
and she has a Weapon Bond to it. She also sees its state as symbolic of her
family’s fortunes, and thus restoring it to its full glory would be a good
omen. She asks Master Caxton, an armorer from Gran Soren, to perform the service
for her.</p>

<p>In game terms, Alexa wants to make her Cheap thrusting broadsword Balanced,
Very Fine, and Silver-Coated. Going from Cheap to Good quality is +0.6 CF;
the other options add up to +25 CF. Multiplying all of that by $600 gives us
a final cost of $15360.</p>

<p>This turns out to be far more money than she has on hand at the moment, so she
settles for making the sword a Good-quality blade for $360, paying all of that
in coin. After conferring with the weaponsmith, she spends the next few days
looking for alchemical reagents that resonate with that particular sword and
with her family legacy: dust from the family crypt, a scrap of silk to signify
nobility, unspoiled silver ore from an old haunted mine in the barony, and a
rare flower that only blooms at night and features prominently in the family’s
coat of arms. That last one was especially hard to find.</p>

<p>The GM judges that the first two components are Basic, the silver is Good and
the Flower is Fine, for a total of $4600 in value. However, since Alexa has gone
to the trouble of making sure every one of them is symbolically related to her
quest to bring glory and prosperity back to her family, they also decide that
these components are enough to cover the $7500 material cost of the upgrade
after all.</p>

<p>That still leaves another $7500 to cover Caxton’s wages, which the Impulsive
Alexa acquires by pawning off the family jewels she smuggled out of the
barony. Nothing ventured, nothing gained!</p>

<p>Now that we have a good handle on the locations and characters of Gransys, let’s
take a look at its <em>stuff</em>. This means both the gear available to its delvers
and the treasure that can be obtained from its dungeons. We’ll start with money,
since that figures prominently in both categories.</p>

<h2 id="currency">Currency</h2>

<p>The original game used a simplified currency system typical of electronic
RPGs. The unit of currency was a generic “gold piece”. Early game items had
2-digit prices for consumables and 4-digit prices for equipment, going up to 5-
and 6-digit prices respectively in the late game. Money was found in bags
containing up to 10 thousand gold pieces either hidden in dungeons, or dropped
from enemies. It could also be earned by selling items in town, and by the
end-game selling unused equipment is the player’s main source of income.</p>

<p>We can afford to be a little more detailed in this adaptation. I want Gransys to
have a currency system that fits more with the “dungeon fantasy” genre and if
possible I also want to sneak a tiny bit of history in there like I did with the
<a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2016/10/06/villages-and-baronies.html">villages and baronies</a>. This results in the following system:</p>

<p>Under Duke Edmun’s rule, Gransys has come to use coinage of several
denominations. The <em>copper penny</em> is worth $1 in GURPS money, is about 23mm in
diameter and weights 8 grams (125 to the kilogram). The <em>silver shilling</em> is
worth $5, has a diameter of 15mm and weights 2.5 grams (400 to the
kilogram). And the <em>ducat</em> is made of gold, worth $100, has a diameter a hair
over 12mm, and weights 2.5 grams (400 to the kilogram). All of them are stamped
with the Duke’s face on one side and with his coat of arms (a dragon with an
exposed heart) on the other.</p>

<p>These coins are heavily used in Gran Soren and the smaller towns of Gransys, and
also by merchants and nobles to conduct their business. They are less widespread
among the common citizens in the baronies and villages, who make most of what
they need themselves and barter with their neighbors for the rest. They might
still own some money from trading with traveling peddlers, but it’s not unusual
for it to be used solely for that purpose. Feudal lords at this level take their
tribute in goods more often than in money.</p>

<p>These coin weights mean that the 10-thousand-coin “giant bag of gold” found in
the orignal game would likely be a good deal smaller than its in-game graphic
indicates, but would weight around 25kg and be worth $1,000,000!  Needless to
say, none but the most fabulous treasures have that much gold in them. The same
weight of silver would be worth $50,000, or $10,000 if it’s copper. Most hoards
will likely be mixed.</p>

<p>PCs can also find variant coins, with different sizes or even made of different
materials. These can come from the neighboring nations or from the ancient
depths of some dungeon. See <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Treasures 1: Glittering
Prizes</strong> for inspiration. “Money changer” isn’t an official occupation in
Gransys, but many a wealthy merchant or collector would be glad to perform the
service for a friendly fee.</p>

<h2 id="mundane-equipment">Mundane Equipment</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, Gransys is mostly a TL 4 setting, with transportation and
information technology still at TL 3. What this means to delver PCs is that the
list of gear available to them matches the one from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>
pretty much exactly.</p>

<p>Those groups who want to go into a little more detail here are encouraged to use
the weapon and armor tables from <strong>GURPS Low-Tech</strong> instead of the ones from the
<strong>Basic Set</strong>, especially for armor. This will generally result in lighter but
more expensive armor, which matches up a bit better with the “realistic Middle
Ages” vibe the setting gives off. And even though only the European Low-Tech
weapons are appropriate for a Gransys game, that will still increase the amount
of possible choices for players.</p>

<p>Gransys towns carry basic mundane equipment and may have a few of the simpler
weapons. Special orders and more elaborate weapons and armor are always
available in Gran Soren, and <em>may</em> be available in towns on an individual
basis. Manors might provide a limited selection of basic gear, but most villages
will be unable to spare anything other than some food.</p>

<h2 id="magic-items">Magic Items</h2>

<p>Magic items merit some special discussion. Like in standard <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong>,
their making is the province of NPCs, but here these aren’t scholarly (or
priestly) enchanters. Instead, they’re artisans who have mastered the secrets of
their craft. These secrets are effectively a form of alchemy, and a master
artisan might be as eccentric as any powerful magician. Still, they usually get
more respect than a powerful spell caster, who is likely to be seen as sinister
and feared for his powers.</p>

<p>Magic items are available in Gran Soren at the same prices quoted in <strong>Dungeon
Fantasy 1</strong>. This includes alchemical concoctions, available from
apothecaries. It might be possible to buy such things in smaller settlements
if the GM thinks they might be home to a sufficiently skilled artisan.</p>

<p>Anything not listed as available for sale in <strong>DF 1</strong> is either an ancient
artifact that has to be pried from a ruin or monster, or the work of a true
master of the sort who hides away from the world and places absurd demands on
prospective customers. Either way, it requires adventuring to get!</p>

<p>At the top end, most of the Artifacts from <strong>Dungeon Fantasy 6</strong> and similar
sources would be appropriate for inclusion in the game. They would obviously
only be available as hard-to-find loot.</p>

<p>In the next article in this series, we’ll take a look at one of the original
game’s most distinctive subsystems - equipment upgrades!</p>

            <p>Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder’s Iconic Characters to
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy!</strong> This is the fifth post in the series. Previous
entries can be found here:</p>

</ul>

<p>Today’s template is the Holy Warrior, which means that today’s character is
Seelah. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Seelah.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Cool, huh? She’s my second favorite design so far, losing only to Kyra (Lini is
a close third). Her <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Seelah">bio</a>, however, is by far the best. It’s quite tragic,
but seems to hit a good balance between “biblical” and “Arthurian”. Her official
stats are <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/seelah.html">here</a>. From these we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Seelah is a paladin of Iomedae the Inheritor, a Lawful Good deity of justice
and protection. She wears heavy armor and fights with sword and shield, with a
bow kept in reserve.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She has the usual varied suite of paladin powers, the ones most emphasized are
her fearlessness, her ability to smite evil, and her healing hands, in that
order.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While Seelah goes after all manner of evil foes, she fights fiends and evil
dragons with particular fervor.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Given Iomedae’s description as the goddess of justice and valor, the default
Holy Warrior package should suit her just fine. The end result doesn’t quite
have the points to afford all the standard paladin abilities - healing is
expensive! However, the GURPS version of Seelah is absolutely fearless,
supernaturally resistant to disease, can channel divine might to enhance her
strength, and is particularly adept at fighting demons. All that as a starting
DF character! Buying the Faith Healing ability with earned character points
should be next on her list.</p>

            <p>Welcome to our second Blog or Treat article! I wanted to do another scary
monster during this week, and figured there was no reason think small. So in
this post we’ll stat up Death.</p>

<h2 id="the-horror-of-death">The Horror of Death</h2>

<p>In the previous article we launched right into the stats of
the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/24/snake-maned-lion.html">Snake-Maned Lion</a>, but here let’s look at the historical and narrative
concepts around the Grim Reaper first.</p>

<p>According to the ever-helpful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(personification)">Wikipedia</a>, many cultures and mythologies
describe different personifications of death. It’s not considered a bad thing in
all of them, which results in the messenger of death looking more like an angel
who merely takes the departed to the afterlife. However, the version we’re
interested in is the black-robed skeleton with the scythe, an invention of
14th-century Europe. The name “Grim Reaper” is more recent, having been first
recorded in 1847.</p>

<p>The mention of “14th-century Europe” might ring a bell. Indeed, that’s when the
Black Death swept through the continent. It’s not a stretch to think that the
skeleton-and-scythe imagery comes from it. It’s as much a personification of the
<em>fear of death</em> as it is of death itself. The Reaper does not symbolize death as
part of a cycle, or a gentle passing into some higher realm. A scythe is not a
tool for gently picking individual wheat stalks. No, the Grim Reaper is the
Death that does to humanity what a farmer does to a field come harvest
time. It’s the Death that takes away your loved ones in the prime of their lives
and then comes for you. You have as much defense against it as wheat does
against the farmer.</p>

<p>The monster and its variants statted up below draw inspiration from this
imagery, and from a couple of other similar creatures I’ve run across in other
games. It’s appropriate for Dungeon Fantasy or horror campaigns, being a much
scarier threat in the latter.</p>

<h2 id="grim-reaper">Grim Reaper</h2>

<p>Long thought just a legend or a metaphor for death, these beings turn out to be
quite real. Most of what is known of them is pure speculation, as almost no one
who got into a position to take a good look at them survived the encounter. Are
they a form of spectral undead? A demon? Are they a <em>species</em> of monster, or is
there just the one avatar of Death itself?</p>

<p>It is known that Grim Reapers are floating figures wearing voluminous, tattered
black robes and wielding large scythes. Beyond that, accounts vary. Some say
they look skeletal, others see a demonic horned visage, and others report only
darkness staring at them from beneath the hood. Some report it carring a lantern
in addition to the scythe.</p>

<p>One of the reasons it’s so hard to get a precise account of how their look is
that these creatures inhabit a place between life and death. They are normally
completely invisible to mortal eyes, and intangible to anything physical! They
attack by reaching through this veil and pulling unwary mortals through. The
closer they are to the reaper’s in-between home, the more than can interact with
it… and once they are close enough, the monster cuts them down with its
absurdly sharp scythe.</p>

<p>No one has encountered more than one Grim Reaper at once… but they tend to
hang out in places soaked in plague and/or evil, much
like <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/24/snake-maned-lion.html">Snake-Maned Lions</a> and other similar monsters, so it wouldn’t be
implausible to encounter it alongside these other creatures.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 18; <strong>DX</strong> 14; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong>: 10; <strong>Parry</strong>: 14; <strong>DR</strong>: 4; <strong>SM</strong> 0</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 18; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong>: 12; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong> 7.5; <strong>Move</strong> 7</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pull Through the Veil</strong> (16): 1 point toxic, and the target becomes marked
by the Reaper (see Notes, below). Reach C, 1. This is a <em>Cosmic</em> attack that
ignores DR, and affects substantial targets.</li>
  <li><strong>Grim Scythe</strong> (18): 3d+3 cut <em>or</em> 3d+1 imp <em>or</em> 1d+1 cut
(Hook). Reach 1. Often done as a Deceptive Attack. This is a <em>Cosmic</em> attack
that ignores DR! See Notes, below, for which targets are valid.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Astral Entity (p. <strong>B263</strong>); Dark Vision (with Color Vision);
Fragile (Unnatural); Flight (max Move 7); Enhanced Parry 2 (Scythe);
Indomitable; Immunity to Mind Control; Injury Tolerance (No Blood, No Brain, No
Vitals, Unliving); Skinny; Temperature Tolerance 10; Unfazeable; Vaccum Support.</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Brawling-16; Two-Handed Axe/Mace-18; Observation-12;</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Undead.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: When a target first becomes <em>marked by the Reaper</em>, they begin
perceiving their surroundings as blurry and colorless (-1 to Per-based rolls to
make out detail). Characters who have been marked once can see the Reaper in
full detail; they can attack it for half damage, and <em>it</em> can attack <em>them</em> for
half damage as well. Twice-Marked characters can interact with the Reaper as if
it was fully substantial and vice-versa.</p>

<p>These marks fade after a minute, returning the character to normal. The scythe
disappears when the creature is slain.</p>

<h3 id="fighting-the-grim-reaper">Fighting the Grim Reaper</h3>

<p>The Reaper attacks by invisibly approaching the most vulnerable-looking party
member, marking them twice, and cutting them down. Its touch grants it the
ability to isolate vulnerable adventurers without having to rely on terrain, as
it remains invisible and insubstantial to the victim’s friends. It makes free
use of tactics such as Deceptive, Defensive, Committed or All-Out Attacks to
exploit holes in its opponent’s defenses.</p>

<p>To effectively fight a Reaper, the PCs should have access to magic that allows
them to see and affect invisible and insubstantial creatures. Being undead, it’s
also vulnerable to some Cleric and Holy Warrior powers. Lacking either of those,
they might contrive to get marked by the monster and fight it that way, though
that’s pretty risky as it’s a superb melee combatant. Its multiple injury
tolerances and high HT mean it might only die when it hits -36 HP, and it’s
smart enough to fly away and try again when the marks have worn off.</p>

<p>Even a single Grim Reaper can pose a significant challenge to a whole delver
party.</p>

<h3 id="variant-reapers">Variant Reapers</h3>

<p>Plenty of variance is possible here by changing the answers to the questions at
the beginning of the monster’s description.</p>

<p><em>Different Class</em>: This variant is not undead, but is either a Demon or a Divine
Servitor. This either makes it vulnerable to a <em>different</em> set of Holy powers,
or not particularly vulnerable to any of them.</p>

<p><em>Greater</em>: This large variant carries an oversized scythe. It might well be
<em>the</em> Grim Reaper! Change ST and HP to 27; change SM to +1; change scythe damage
to 5d+5 cutting <em>or</em> 5d+2 imp <em>or</em> 3d-2 cutting (Hook); change scythe range to
1-2.</p>

<p><em>Lantern-Bearing</em>: This variant carries a skull-shaped lantern in addition to
its scythe. The lantern can cast Mass Sleep at power 15 and has a 30-point
Energy Reserve. Particularly cruel GMs can have the Mass Sleep be cast at power
20 instead. The lantern also disappears if the creature is slain.</p>

<p><em>Materialized</em>: While still a spirit, this variant exists closer to the world of
the living than to the world of the dead. It’s visible and almost solid, but
still difficult to hurt. Remove Astral Entity and the Pull Through the Veil
attack and replace Injury Tolerance (Unliving) with Injury Tolerance (Diffuse).</p>

<p>Incidentally, one of the inspirations for this monster is Dragon’s Dogma, which
features a Greater, Materialized, Lantern-Bearing Grim Reaper in its most
dangerous dungeon.</p>

            <p>Welcome to Blog or Treat, a Halloween Special conspiracy concocted by a
secretive cabal of GURPS bloggers. Here at Octopus Carnival, I will present to
you two particularly scary monsters! One you see below, the other will grace
your screen tomorrow.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="the-snake-maned-lion">The Snake-Maned Lion</h2>

<p>This horrible beast is a nightmare made flesh, a huge lion with a dozen venomous
snakes growing out of its black mane. Some sages proclaim it comes from the
darkest faerie realms, while others ascribe an infernal origin to it. What they
do agree on is that he creature makes its home in places haunted by evil. It
hunts at night, drawn to the scent of fresh blood, the cries of small and
helpless things, or any light sources.</p>

<p>The snake-maned lion possesses animal intelligence, but it’s clever enough to
adapt its tactics to the strength of its potential prey. When faced with a weak
or helpless victim, it delights in striding boldly into view and letting out an
intimidating roar followed by a frontal attack. When faced with a group of more
capable opposition, it will attempt to strike from ambush, targetting isolated
stragglers and using its roar to drive others away before dragging its victim
off. In either case, it prefers to attack by biting and hanging on, letting the
snakes finish the job and helping them along with its claws.</p>

<p>The monster is solitary in that it’s rarely seen together with others of its
kind, but its choice of hunting ground means it’s often encountered alongside a
group of undead or demonic creatures. It seems to have a natural tendency to
leave these monster types alone, and they in turn don’t bother it. Sometimes, a
more powerful villain such as a lich, dark fey lord, or demon will manage to
tame one of these beasts.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 20; <strong>DX</strong> 13; <strong>IQ</strong> 5; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 10; <strong>DR</strong> 1 (Tough Skin); <strong>SM</strong> +1</p>

<p><strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>HP</strong> 20; <strong>FP</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong> 6.25; <strong>Move</strong> 6.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Terrifying Roar (-)</strong> : Anyone who hears it must make a Fright Check at
-2. Usable once per fight.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (15)</strong>: 2d cutting. Reach C. May grapple the target on a hit. Parried
as a weapon.</li>
  <li><strong>Talons (15)</strong>: 2d cutting. Reach C, 1. Parried as a weapon.</li>
  <li><strong>Serpent Mane (18) (x4)</strong>: 2 points impaling + follow-up 1d toxic (HT-1, plus
-1 per additional bite, to resist; 5 cycles; 1 minute per cycle). Often aimed
at the face (-5) or neck (-5) if those are unarmored.</li>
  <li><strong>A Thousand Bites (-)</strong>: A Bite aimed at the torso followed by four Serpent
Mane attacks aimed at the grappled target’s torso, face, or head.</li>
  <li><strong>Horrid Onslaught (-)</strong>: A Rapid Strike combining a Talons attack and a Bite
aimed at the torso, followed by four Serpent Mane attacks aimed at the
grappled target’s torso, face or head.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Combat Reflexes; Extra Attack 4 (Serpent Mane only);
Fearlessness 5; Night Vision 7; Penetrating Voice; Quadruped; Restricted Diet
(Fresh Meat); Sadism (9); Wild Animal; Terror 2 (Roar).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Brawling-15; Stealth-15; Wrestling-15;</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Hybrid.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Animal spells which affect hybrids work on the lion.</p>

<h3 id="fighting-the-snake-maned-lion">Fighting the Snake-Maned Lion</h3>

<p>As you can see from its stats, getting into melee combat with the snake-maned
lion is a very bad idea. Through a combination of high skill, Rapid Strikes and
Extra Attacks it has a very good chance of damaging its chosen victim at least
once per turn.</p>

<p>The beast should be fought at a distance, with ranged weapons or magic. Of
course, it will try its hardest to force a melee confrontation by sneaking in
close before its initial pounce, and it might disrupt the efforts of any ranged
attackers with its roar. If keeping away is not an option, distracting it with
numbers and flanking it is the next best bet.</p>

<p>The sound of the lion’s roar is audible over a mile away, so unless the PCs take
precautions like plugging their ears in advance, they <em>will</em> be inside its area
of effect at the ranges in which the monster likes to use it.</p>

<h3 id="variant-lions">Variant Lions</h3>

<p>The Snake-Maned Lion has some similarities to mythological beasts such as the
Chimera or the Manticore, and might fulfill similar narrative roles. According
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology)">this Wikipedia article on the Chimera</a>, chimerical figures appear in
medieval art as deceptive or even satanic embodiments or raw nature.</p>

<p>The base creature above is well-suited to this, but if you don’t think it’s
scary enough you can try these variants:</p>

<p><em>Armored</em>: This variant is covered in reptilian scales instead of leonine
hide. Raise DR to 4 and remove the Tough Skin limitation.</p>

<p><em>Intelligent</em>: This variant is smart enough to understand speech and come up
with really clever ambush setups. It’s also no longer affected by Animal spells,
requiring Mind Control magic instead. Raise IQ to 8, Will to 12, and remove Wild
Animal.</p>

<p><em>Demonic</em>: A materialized spirit from hell set loose in our plane! Change its
class to Demon and add Injury Tolerance (Homogenous), which makes it a lot more
resistant to most ranged weapons.</p>

<p>These variants can stack with each other and with any of the generic monster
prefixes from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 1</strong>.</p>
