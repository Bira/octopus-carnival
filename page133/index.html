            <p>Looks like my “real-time” gaming group liked the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/08/08/planet-mercenary-actual-play.html">first session</a> of the
Damaxuri Deception so much that they decided to alternate between D&amp;D 5th
Edition and Planet Mercenary until we’re done with it. This made me quite happy,
because I missed being the GM and the system is quite fun. Descriptions for our
cast of player characters can be found <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/08/07/planet-mercenary-actual-play.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rumble-at-the-warehouse">Rumble at the Warehouse</h2>

<p>When we last left Skynet’s Avengers, they had just defeated a bunch of Kostavi’s
thugs guarding a fake hideout, and interrogated the survivor before leaving the
scene of the fight. The guy told them Kostavi had holed up in <em>another</em>
abandoned warehouse with a small army of henchthings. This other warehouse had a
cargo elevator that led right into the building from the spaceport on the
surface.</p>

<p>The party figured that if they were the ones hiding, they would play to use the
shaft as an escape route. After arguing about it for a while they came up with
the following plan: Rufus and his fireteam would go topside and infiltrate the
warehouse through the elevator shaft, while the rest of the company performed a
frontal assault on the warehouse. This would trap the enemies inside and give
the Avengers an edge in the fight.</p>

<p>There was one small wrinkle in that plan: the elevator door was locked! It had a
big “Out of Order” sign on it, behind which hid a fairly sophisticated lock. The
PCs would need to hack that lock or find another way to open the door.</p>

<p>So Orangus decided he would build a bomb. He didn’t have any boomex, and the
company had no money with which to buy some, so he used household chemicals,
random debris and a large trash can to build a home-brewed monstrosity. He
succeeded by just enough to build <em>something</em>, drew the “Spit, Balling Wire and
Brass Ball Bearings” Mayhem card, and succeeded in the Engineering roll it asked
for despite not having the skill. The effect of that of course went into the
bomb, which I ruled was what allowed it to breach the door when it went off.</p>

<p>With the bomb in place, they split up according to the plan, and begun the
assault. Kostavi’s hideout was protected on the outside by a pair of minigun
drones disguised as trash cans, and once the shooting started someone fired a
rocket through the door from within, nearly missing Orangus.</p>

<p>It’s here that the party was formally introduced to what I call the Powered
Armor Conundrum. Heavy armor in <strong>Planet Mercenary</strong> has 1 Hull Point, making it
equivalent to an armored vehicle. This means it and its wearer can only be hurt
by anti-vehicular weapons. However, even one hit by such a weapon will destroy
the <em>ruinously expensive</em> suit, which means PCs wearing the best armor are the
ones most afraid of being hit in any fight involving heavy weapons. Such as this
one.</p>

<p>Aside from the two drones, Kostavi had four goon squads inside the warehouse,
hiding amongst piles of containers arranged to serve as cover. I ruled one of
these had rocket launchers - they’d still do the damage listed in their basic
stat block, but that damage would have the Anti-Vehicular Payload tag. That
prevented Orangus from running amok without fear of being hit.</p>

<p>Kostavi herself was in a suit of flying powered armor equipped with a rocket
launcher and plasma cannon, in addition to a Goaltender drone. She fought openly
until Orangus managed to tag her with a plasma bolt and destroy her armor. From
that point on, her tactic consisted of hiding and sneaking around the warehouse
while her goons distracted the PCs, taking every opportunity to snipe at the
geatest threats. When Rufus revealed himself, it became obvious that the
greatest threat was <em>him</em>, since he was blocking Kostavi’s retreat.</p>

<p>Kostavi broadcast that she had a bomb tied to a heart monitor, and would
manually detonate it unless the PCs stood down and let her leave. The PCs called
her bluff and kept fighting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I never managed to hit anyone with a heavy weapon - the players
wisely began to use one action each turn to dodge, and kept rolling well on
those attempts. Some of the more lightly armored characters did get hit. I told
them how much damage they would suffer and gave them a chance to spend a RiPP on
Ablative Meat, which meant that the rule got used fairly often. Thus did poor
Jonas from the grunt pool meet his death in battle. Other uses of the rule
caused one Leto’s Joy clones to be named Joy Katislene<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and Rufus to remind
me that he named most of his fireteam after the cast of Avatar: The Last
Airbender.</p>

<p>Rufus was in a particularly bad position here because a lot of enemies were
targetting him, and I ruled that since he on the opposite side of the
battlefield from most of the company he didn’t have access to the Grunt Pool for
Ablative Meat purposes. He also didn’t remember to dodge in the first few
rounds. Fortunately, his grunts were lucky, and would survive to complain about
him another day.</p>

<p>Soon the party began to spend more actions looking for Kostavi in the middle of
the fight than actually fighting! The problem here was that only Orangus and Max
had even middling Perception, and she had a Stealth of 11 and rolled really
well.</p>

<p>Orangus decides he’s going to end this swiftly by finding the best place to
plant a bomb on this building and doing that. He not only found the perfect
spot, but also found that someone had already planted a bomb there. A <em>nuclear</em>
bomb. That bluff wasn’t quite as bluffy as they thought!</p>

<p>Orangus recognizes the device as an Urthreep Industries Dial-a-Yield, which is
currently set to something equivalent to 1 ton of TNT. He decides to disarm it
right then and there, and between his high Demolitions skill, his specialty in
Disarming and generous RiPP expenditure, manages to roll a 23. The bomb is
deactivated!</p>

<p>Kostavi still eludes them for a while longer. Finally I turn to Leto, whose turn
it was at the time:</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: Pay me one RiPP and I’ll let you find Kostavi.</p>

<p>So Leto spots her hiding out aways from the main body of the fight, lining up
another shot, and communicates her location to the company. Rufus leaves his
position to charge hers, and attempts to subdue Kostavi in unarmed combat. She
nimbly dodges away and shoots him point-blank with a plasma cannon.</p>

<p>Now, some time before the fight started, Rufus had drawn the “Oh Captain, My
Captain” Mayhem card. This card can be invoked when the PC in question is about
to take damage and has the effect of applying the damage to the Captain instead,
essentially using them as free Ablative Meat for that attack.</p>

<p>I initially considered voiding the card, since the company Captain is Skynet,
which is also <em>their ship</em>. Then I decided I would come up with something if the
card came into play, and told him to keep it. Since Rufus was more afraid of
losing his extremely pricey EX Supersuit than of losing his captain, he used the
card when Kostavi hit him.</p>

<p>This means that the sound of an explosion was heard over the company comms, and
Skynet cooly ordered them to finish that firefight already and come help her
repel these pesky boarders. So yeah, Rufus was safe but the Captain took a hit.</p>

<p>The fight did end soon after that, when Leto attempted to charge Kostavi and
melee her. He had a Melee of 1, she had a Defense of 18, he rolled a
natural 17. Leto does a fixed 11 damage with his claws, which left Kostavi with
1 hp. I ruled she had been squashed like a bug and was unconscious.</p>

<p>Leto broadcasts to the enemies that he has their boss and that if they don’t
stand down he’ll finish her off and make the bomb explode. The bomb in question
has been very publically disarmed, so I he rolls Bluff to make the threat
stick. It turns out Kostavi is so underhanded her goons are ready to believe she
had another bomb hidden somewhere. They drop their weapons and surrender. The
party lets them leave, since they claim they were just hired muscle and that’s
something they can empathize with. Their stuff stays, of course.</p>

<h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s All, Folks!</h2>

<p>And that’s where we stopped the session, since we were out of time. The party
has to take the unconscious Kostavi to the authorities without getting
implicated in the many shootouts and explosions they engaged in, and now they
also have the matter of the boarders currently trying to enter their ship<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Who are these boarders? I don’t know yet! We are entering uncharted territory
here, since that bit isn’t in the published adventure. I have two weeks to come
up with them.</p>

<p>This session was a little more “rules-intensive” from my point of view, which
left less space for levity. The players, however, told me they found it even
more fun than the first session, so I’m happy. I discovered I was operating
under a slight misconception regarding Mayhem: only <em>players</em> draw Mayhem cards,
and only when the test in question <em>succeeds</em>. Before this, they managed to turn
at least one failure into a success due to a serendipitous Mayhem draw.</p>

<p>For the next session I’ll also refresh my memory on how goon squads work - for
this fight, I ruled that a non-area-effect attack would kill at most one
individual in the squad, so even though the goons only had 2hp apiece it took 3
successful attacks to take the whole squad out. It made them a suitable threat
for the players and their up-gunned fireteams.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> follows a pretty traditional split for
its magic. Wizards can do almost everything, but healing and other related magic
are the sole province of clerics, who in turn get their spells from the
gods. Druids also have their own “turf” staked out, receiving their powers from
the might of Nature. This, of course, means that in your typical Dungeon Fantasy
setting the gods are real and Nature as a whole is itself a sort of deity.</p>

<p>That’s not a problem for groups who want to play in the game’s implied setting,
or in an established setting that follows the same conventions. On the contrary,
it makes playing in those worlds very straightforward!</p>

<p>However, not all settings follow these conventions. One popular example is
Thedas, the setting of the <em>Dragon Age</em> games. Another is the world of <em>Dragon’s
Dogma</em>, which I have been covering <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">in some detail</a> on this blog. Though
faith and religion are prominent themes in these worlds, priests don’t gain any
supernatural powers from their deities. In fact, the very existence of the gods
is a matter of, well, faith. All magic is wizardly in nature, even spells that
deal with healing or with plants and animals.</p>

<p>Even some D&amp;D settings take a similar approach. Eberron still restricts access
to healing magic to “divine” characters, but their powers come from specialized
training rather than being granted through prayer. Does the training put clerics
in direct contact with their gods, or is it just a specialized form of wizardry?
Once again, it’s a matter of faith.</p>

<p>And then there’s <em>Final Fantasy</em>, a series that does its own thing by having
very present “god-like” entities in each of its games yet stating that the magic
traditionally associated with clerics is wielded by especially trained wizards
that don’t necessarily have any relation to those entities.</p>

<p>GMs who want to use <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> to run a campaign in one of those
settings, or in a home-brewed setting following similar themes, need to do a bit
of work. I’ve included several suggestions on how to do it below.</p>

<h2 id="first-step-clerics-are-wizards">First Step: Clerics are Wizards</h2>

<p>In an “agnostic” <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> setting, all magic is wizardly! Neither
type of Power Investiture exists. Druids and clerics rely on Magery instead. In
effect, they are wizards who underwent somewhat different training.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The “set” advantages in the Cleric template become Clerical Investment {5} and
Magery 3 {35}, leaving 40 discretionary points for advantages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The “set” advantages in the Druid template become Green Thumb 1 {5} and Magery
3 {35}, leaving 35 discretionary points for advantages.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This step is the same no matter what other decisions you make for the campaign.</p>

<h2 id="second-step-spells">Second Step: Spells</h2>

<p>Since everyone is a wizard, everyone draws from the same spell list! This list
should include all the spells that were previously forbidden to wizards, since
that particular kind of niche protection is now unnecessary. All former clerical
and druidic spells rely on mana, and are affected by the same countermeasures as
wizardly spells.</p>

<p>If you’re using the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> boxed set, this presents a bit of a
problem. Wizardly spells have complex prerequisite chains, while the others have
no requirements beyond a certain level of Power Investiture. How to effectively
combine the two? Here are some alternatives:</p>

<h3 id="the-simple-option">The Simple Option</h3>

<p>If you’re trying to learn a spell from the Cleric or Druid lists that isn’t also
on the Wizard list, look up its required level of Power Investiture, and read
that as the required level of Magery for the spell. That is its only
prerequisite! If the spell in question <em>is</em> on the Wizard list, you <em>must</em> use
its standard wizardly prerequisites.</p>

<p>This is a good option for settings like that of <em>Dragon Age</em> or <em>Dragon’s
Dogma</em>, where healing or nature magic is something any wizard can learn.</p>

<h3 id="the-complex-option">The Complex Option</h3>

<p>Under this option, clerics and druids train in exotic styles or wizardry only
taught to members of their church or circle. Record the Cleric’s Magery as
Magery (Holy), and the Druid’s as Magery (Druidic)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. They use their
traditional spell lists and prerequisite structure, though their spells still
count as wizardly and are affected by mana levels and magical countermeasures.</p>

<p>All three spell-casting professions also gain access to the following advantage:</p>

<h4 id="magical-style-familiarity-2-pointslevel">Magical Style Familiarity (2 points/level)</h4>

<p><strong>Prerequisite: Magery (Any) 1+</strong></p>

<p>You have learned the secrets of another magical style. Specify which one
(Wizardly, Holy, or Druidic) when you first buy this advantage. This must
obviously be different from your first style!</p>

<p>You can learn spells from your new style as if you had that style’s Magery at a
level equal to your level in this advantage. You can’t have more levels of this
advantage than you have Magery. When you learn a spell, also write down which
style it is from. Spells learned as part of one style can’t serve as
prerequisites for another!</p>

<p>The GM might ask for a story reason for you to learn this advantage, such as
joining a religious order, druidic circle, or wizard’s guild. If you already
know two styles, you can buy the advantage again to learn the third one!</p>

<p>This is a good option for settings in the vein of Eberron or Final Fantasy,
where the different types of magic are all gained through training but their
practitioners jealously guard their secrets from each other<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="the-expensive-option">The Expensive Option</h3>

<p>Use the prerequisite chains from <strong>GURPS Magic</strong>, which already organizes all of
its spells as if they were wizardly. This is the expensive option because you
would need to acquire the book if you don’t have it already, and using it <em>just</em>
for the prerequisites might be a bit wasteful. It does have a fair number of
spells that aren’t present in the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> boxed set, though those
would need some careful scrutiny before you can let them into your game.</p>

<h2 id="third-step-special-abilities">Third Step: Special Abilities</h2>

<p>Clerical and Druidic magic are more than just spells! Each includes a set of
intrinsic powers bought as advantages, known as Holy Might and Druidic
Arts. They are an important part of these templates, and vital to the Holy
Warrior, who relies entirely on Holy Might instead of spells.</p>

<p>What should we do with them? Once again, there are several options.</p>

<h3 id="the-harsh-option">The Harsh Option</h3>

<p>These abilities simply don’t exist in the setting. Magic means spells,
period. This means that those discretionary points for Druids and Clerics that
don’t go into advantages will go to spells instead, and that the Holy Warrior
template cannot be used as-is in your campaign.</p>

<p>The appropriate template to use in its place depends on what the player’s
central concept is. A warrior who is a member of a Church could be a Knight,
perhaps with Clerical Investment added in. A character who needs to combine
martial prowess with a bit of supernatural help could be a well-armed Cleric who
put a few additional points into ST and weapon skills.</p>

<p>Spell-casting characters can still spend their points on supernatural advantages
permitted to wizards, such as Wild Magic or Improved Magic Resistance.</p>

<p>This is harsh because it significantly cuts down on the number of available
character options! It most resembles the very oldest versions of D&amp;D, which
didn’t have a cleric class. Most other fantasy settings I know of feature at
least some kind of non-spell supernatural power, even if it’s just the ability
to turn undead.</p>

<h3 id="the-cool-option">The Cool Option</h3>

<p>Both Holy Might and Druidic Arts are now considered “wizardly” powers! Magery
becomes the applicable talent for them. Instead of depending on the wielder’s
virtuous conduct or on the strength of Nature, they now depend on <em>mana</em>, just
like spells.</p>

<p>This means they work normally when the mana level is normal or higher. When it’s
low, the character either gets a -5 to any rolls to use the ability, or a 50%
reduction in potency if the ability doesn’t require a roll. In a no mana zone,
they don’t work at all!</p>

<p>The flavor of each ability’s description should change to reflect their new
nature, where appropriate. For example, Holy Might abilities whose descriptions
imply divine guidance would instead be based on divination magic. Where a
specific ability has an effect that overlaps with an existing Wizard power-up,
use the Wizard version instead. This mostly means using Wild Magic
(<strong>Adventurers</strong>, p. 41) instead of Contingency Casting (<strong>Adventurers</strong>,
p. 20).</p>

<p>In a setting where any magician can learn any spell, they can also learn any of
these abilities. In settings that use the Complex option, a character can learn
the abilities for their own “style” and for any other for which they bought
Magical Style Familiarity, with the level of that advantage serving as the
talent for the power. Everyone who would have access to Contingency Casting
still has access to Wild Magic instead without having to pay extra for it.</p>

<p>Mana-based Holy Might abilities <em>don’t</em> go away if their wielder stops behaving
virtuously, which allows for stories where villains hide among the ranks of the
Church, or where the organization itself behaves terribly while claiming virtue
is on their side. These are the hallmark of “grittier” settings like that of
<em>Dragon Age</em>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>By picking one option for spells and one for abilities from the ones outlined
above you would be well on your way to having an “agnostic” Dungeon Fantasy
setting.</p>

<p>For comparison, the Dragon’s Dogma adaptation I’ve been writing on this blog
uses the Expensive option for spells because it predates the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong>
boxed set and assumes the GM will already have <strong>GURPS Magic</strong>. For magical
abilities, it takes an approach similar to the Harsh option but adds a custom
list of power-ups any magical character can learn. It would work just as well
with the Simple and Cool options instead.</p>

<p>While this is realistic, the type of story that likely inspired you is quite
cinematic, which makes seeing those penalties a bit disappointing. One-eyed

<p>You may have only one eye, but that doesn’t even slow you down! You do not
suffer from the DX and skill penalties from the realistic version of this
advantage, and may generally behave as if you had perfect depth perception and a
full field of view. This is typical of action heroes, and naturally one-eyed
aliens or fantasy creatures.</p>

<p>This is worth points as a disadvantage because you still do have only one eye!
If that eye is crippled, you’re <em>blind</em>. You also suffer any other consequences
that might be attached ot the condition in your setting, such as social
penalties or bonuses for other people to recognize you.</p>

<p>This disadvantage is also still worth points in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong>. Its implied
setting might not attach any social penalties to the condition, but it <em>does</em>
make losing an eye something far more likely to happen than in other settings,
which puts you at an increased risk of going blind.</p>

<p>I’ll begin this review by saying I’m really not the best person to review the
<strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> (DFRPG). It’s not that dislike it: in fact,
I loved it! However, I’m really bad at reading through the text in detail and
spotting all the differences between the game and the GURPS supplements that
originated it. I know these differences exist, and I know they make the game
better, but I’ll probably only internalize them when I reference the text in
play enough times.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it seems I’m late to the party when it comes to reviewing the
<strong>DFRPG</strong>, so I can point you to lots of other reviews by other people who are
better at this than me! Just Roll 3d6 has very detailed reviews of
the <a href="http://justroll3d6.com/dfrpg-review-adventurers/">Adventurers</a> and <a href="http://justroll3d6.com/dfrpg-review-exploits/">Exploits</a> books. <a href="https://pseudoboo.blogspot.com.br/">Let’s GURPS</a> is reviewing all
the recently-released books too. And I’m sure many other reviews will pop up in
time.</p>

<p>What I’ll do in this article is something only I can do: give you my own opinion
on the game. Whether that is of any value is left as an exercise for the
reader.</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

<p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> is my favorite edition of D&amp;D. Go out
and buy it as soon as it comes out.</p>

<h2 id="wait-what">Wait, What?</h2>

<p>Technically, my favorite edition of D&amp;D is 4th, but it occupies that position
for very specific reasons. It allows me to run cool, flashy battles in the style
of turn-based tactical RPGs such as Disgaea, Fire Emblem, or Final Fantasy
Tactics. If I want a campaign that feels like that, I reach for D&amp;D 4.</p>

<p>If I don’t want to run a campaign that feels like that, my tastes get a bit
fiddlier. I will <em>play</em> D&amp;D 5th edition if no other alternative presents itself,
but it doesn’t look very exciting to GM. Earlier editions add to that an
elaborate list of varied complaints that I’m sure anyone familiar with them can
guess, and I’m not one of those enlightened souls who can forget about them for
long enough to enjoy a session.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> has a premise that’s exactly like that
of Basic D&amp;D (one of the most popular OSR darlings), married to a ruleset that
does everything most editions of D&amp;D do in a way I find better. It’s
point-based! It has a unified mechanic! It has a good skill system!
Warrior-types are <em>actually</em> better at combat than spellcasters!</p>

<p>You can of course also run flashy set-piece battles with it, and they’ll tend to
have a feel that’s closer to that of the old-school editions.</p>

<p>It takes all of that from GURPS. Its rules are a specialized version of GURPS
4th Edition, with everything that’s not relevant to dungeon-crawling fantasy
campaigns stripped out and the rest adapted to the purpose. Some parts are
simpler than in the original rules, some are not, but they’re all useful. A lot
of those things which usually lead to heated arguments between players and DMs
are given proper rules and effects here. Want to stab that ogre in the eye?
Perform some unlikely feat of parkour? Check to see if that dead monster has
valuable body parts? The system has you covered.</p>

<p><strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> gives you 11 “professional templates” that are roughly
equivalent to some of the most popular D&amp;D classes, and which can be humans or
one of a selection of 8 racial templates that includes all the usual suspects
plus the Catfolk<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>While the game focuses very heavily on dungeon-delving, it’s certainly possible
to use it for fantasy campaigns that go beyond the dungeon. It has more support
for social interaction than Basic D&amp;D does<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and bringing in more detailed
rules from GURPS is extremely easy, if the GM thinks it’s necessary.</p>

<p>So yes, if I was planning on running a D&amp;D-ish campaign and wasn’t after the
very specific feel of D&amp;D 4 combat, I would use <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> in
preference to any other actual edition of D&amp;D. In fact, I have been doing
just that for years using the previous iteration of these rules, and will gladly
switch to the new one now that I have it in my hands.</p>

<p><strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> isn’t yet available to the public as of this writing, but
the Kickstarter backers have already begun receiving their copies. Both the
printed and PDF versions should appear on <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com">Warehouse 23</a> in October.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Having <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/08/07/planet-mercenary-actual-play.html">finished our characters</a>, we gathered ‘round in the second “gap”
weekend to play through <em>The Damaxuri Deception</em>. We started one hour later than
usual, due to some uncertainty over whether I would be able to make it and due
to one other player having spent the previous night at a party. Everyone else,
including me, was able to make it at the usual time of 9 AM, so we spent that
hour finishing up our fireteams.</p>

<p>Now, the players were well-aware of their company’s financial dire straits, and
from the skills they had chosen it was clear that they expected to get into
fights early and often. So I told then this adventure started in a dangerous and
unfamiliar place fraught with tension and itchy trigger fingers… a mercenary
convention! The quotes below are freely translated from Portuguese, since that
was the language we played in.</p>

<h2 id="scene-1-merccon-713">Scene 1: MercCon 713</h2>

<p>Welcome to the 713th edition of Merc-Con! Taking place in a quaint historical
habitat above scenic Damaxuri, and partly sponsored by the city of
Mellsen-Anlied (located on the surface under the station). And if you believe
the habitat is quaint or the planet is scenic, I’ve got a bridge to sell
you. This flating hunk of junk they call a station was the only place that would
consent to hosting an event for 2000 mercenaries.</p>

<p>Into it go the officers of Skynet’s Avengers, accompanied by a small drone
projecting the unblinking red eye that is the avatar of Skynet herself<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Why
are they going to a conference when the company is in the red? Skynet paid for
it ages ago and the fee is non-refundable, so they might as well make the most
of it. And hey, someone there might be hiring!</p>

<p>The station is quite hot and stinky because its creaky life support systems
can’t keep up with the body heat and body odor of 2000 sweaty mercs and the
assorted vendors who set up shop here for the event. Fortunatly, most of the PCs
are wearing their climate-controlled suits of armor. The sole exception is poor
Orangus, whose armor is a bit too heavy (and illegal!) to be acceptable attire
for anything that’s not a firefight. He’s wearing a respirator for the smell,
but his civvies and thick fur don’t help against the heat. The player’s vivid
description of his suffering earned him the game’s first RiPP.</p>

<p>The PCs linger for a while at the booth of an Unioc named Banjo Tabberlin<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> as
they watch an O’benn customer of his try out a Phubhar Shurikannon<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and cover
every inch of the shooting gallery’s back wall with metal stars, leaving the
paper target at the center untouched. Banjo comments that the Phubhar lot he
received today is quite above-average in quality. Only two weapons exploded so
far!</p>

<p>They talked with Banjo a bit and were interested in the capabilities of the M3
Incapacitator he showed them… but gave up on it whey they heard it cost twice
what they paid for the company APC. They ended up trading comm numbers, and went
to the food court.</p>

<p>There, Leto socialized a bit with Fulda Purrgathor, the medic of all-Ursumari
company Icewall Security. She and some of her buddies were ear-deep into large
bowls of shaved ice. Fulda was a bit insensitive in her comments that working on
any patient smaller than an ursumari was much too fiddly for her tastes, but
Leto assured her it was good practice.</p>

<p>After a while Skynet reminded the group that the keynote would start in 15
minutes. The speaker was Colonel Drake Pranger, the leader of one of the
galaxy’s top mercenary companies. Skynet paid a fortune for her officers to hear
this blowhard speak, and she didn’t want them to waste the money.</p>

<p>Before heading to the keynote the PCs decided to mingle and try to look for
contracts in the con by looking for anyone who seemed to be tied to one of the
galaxy’s major ongoing conflicts. A task at which they failed miserably due to
their lack of relevant skills. The only conflict that came to their minds was
the biggest of them all - the war between the godlike AIs of the Plenipotent
Dominion and the dark matter entities of Andromeda.</p>

<p><strong>Orangus</strong>: Hey, Cap’n, you’re an AI! Can’t you talk to the PD?</p>

<p><strong>Skynet</strong>: No. I do not wish to be assimilated.</p>

<p><strong>Orangus</strong>: Then can’t we work for the other guys?</p>

<p><strong>Skynet</strong>: No. I do not wish to destroy all baryonic life in the galaxy<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Orangus here was the recipient of the game’s first Mayhem card: “Spin
Control”. He now felt extremely driven to make the company look good, and his
efforts would result in a +1 increase in Reputation for every RiPP he had left
at the end of the session.</p>

<p>Rufus decided to appeal to a higher authority and ask Skynet if she knew of
someone who was hiring. The AI reminded him he had just acquired the contact
information of a known arms dealer. Rufus asked her to call him, and she
delegated the duty right back to him.</p>

<p>It turns out Banjo did have a hot tip for them! A big bounty was going to be
posted to the local hypernet during the keynote, so they should keep an ear out
for it. So forewarned, they moved on.</p>

<h2 id="scene-2-the-keynote-and-what-came-after">Scene 2: The Keynote, and What Came After</h2>

<p>The PCs found their seats in the improvised lecture hall. Orangus put his feet
up on a chair in the row ahead of him, only to have the tiny Esspererin seated
there take a perch on his feet instead. “Hey man, thanks for the lift!” Leto has
brought a tub of ice cream and is paying more attention to it than to the hall.</p>

<p>Rufus scans the crowd, trying to spot competing companies. He fails to recognize
any, but deduces that the huge group of Esspererin in the two rows in front of
them probably belong to the same company, as does a group of humanoids further
away wearing matching uniforms.</p>

<p>Pranger enters the stage and swaggers up to his podium like the high-level NPC
he is<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. He takes a deep breath, opens his mouth to speak… and is
interrupted by a deafening chime as every monitor in the hall, and every
handbrain in the room, flashes the alert that a very substantial bounty has been
posted for a human arms dealer named Kostavi, who has been sighted in
Mellsen-Anlied.</p>

<p>The players don’t need to roll to figure out who she is: Kostavi is quite
infamous for selling weapons to the sort of people who should never have them,
and causing lots of civilian casualties in the process. Sooner or later
something like this was bound to happen, and since the bounty is equivalent to 5
Resources, it’s just what the Avengers need to make payroll for the next few
months.</p>

<p>A lot of the keynote audience thinks the same, and <em>everyone</em> begins getting up
and rushing to their ships. At this point all players begin talking, and I begin
to employ the game’s initiative system: whoever speaks first, goes first. This
time, it’s Rufus, who engages his Supersuit’s flight mode and tries to carry Max
with him. He rolls a natural 18 on 3d6, which is a critical success.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: Pick one other PC to carry along with you.</p>

<p><strong>Rufus</strong>: I choose the bear!</p>

<p>So there he goes, carrying Max over one shoulder and Leto by the scruff of the
neck as the bear roars as loud as he can to clear a path. Orangus runs after
them, and meets his powered armor suit on the way so he can fly too.</p>

<p>With Banjo’s forewarning and their impressive die rolls, the party manages to
leave the hangar first, and is almost immediately fired upon by the Esspererin
vessel <em>Neoshka Kree</em>, crewed by an Esspee merc outfit based out of a piratical
cluster. Behind them is a crew of human piratical mercs, and behind <em>them</em> is
the huge, lumbering Icewall Security vessel <em>Advancing Ice</em>.</p>

<p>Time for some starship combat! I tell my players they’re all controlling the
actions of Skynet as she pilots the <em>Star Destroyer</em>. Their PCs are cowering in
their crash seats inside.</p>

<p>Leto’s player is very tempted to fire on the <em>Advancing Ice</em>, but gives up when
I specify how much bigger the other ship is. The group ends up engaging the
<em>Neoshka Kree</em> and firing to disable. The <em>Star Destroyer</em> takes a missile hit,
but it’s not enough to put it out of commision. The other ship is disabled, and
drifts down to the planetary surface. The PCs land on Mellsen-Anlied on their
flying APC.</p>

<h2 id="scene-3-search-and-destroy">Scene 3: Search and Destroy</h2>

<p>I ask for Perception rolls to abstract the initial search for Kostavi. They know
she’s in the city, but not exactly where. Rufus and Leto beat the TN of 15, and
both Rufus and Max draw Mayhem. Rufus gets a good card that allows him to
declare a failed roll by someone else is actually a critical success as long as
he can explain how. Max gets “Friendly Fire”.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: For your information, you can always pay a RiPP to negate a card.</p>

<p><strong>Max</strong>: Screw that, I want to see what happens!</p>

<p>So I narrate that they learn that Kostavi’s hideout is in an abandoned warehouse
in the lower levels of the city. There’s a transit elevator that should bring
them very close to it… but it’s old, rusted, and alarmingly creaky. Due to the
effect of the card, Max assures all of them the elevator is perfectly safe. As
the company engineer, he knows machines, so they all should believe him!</p>

<p>The whole party (which numbers 20 with the fireteams) walks into the
elevator. The thing’s cables snap halfway to their destination, so now every PC
must explain how they avoid taking 2d6 points of armor-ignoring damage when they
hit the bottom of the shaft<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Orangus speaks first: he wants to use his UNS I-CC powered armor to fly through
the elevator’s ceiling and hold the elevator up to slow its fall! I ask him to
make an Aerial Vehicles and an Athlethics roll. Both succeed by lots, and the
Athletics roll draws Mayhem!</p>

<p>The card is simply hilarious given the situation. Orangus is overcome with the
need to stop what he’s doing and tell a story the situation reminded him
of. Since what he’s doing is <em>saving the lives of half the company</em>, the player
wisely decides to spend a RiPP to negate this, as soon as he can stop laughing
for long enough to talk.</p>

<p><strong>Orangus</strong>: But man, was that going to be one heck of a story!</p>

<p>Shaken but mostly intact, the party heads to the warehouse where Kostavi is
hiding. Rufus scouts ahead stealthily along with his unit, and draws a Mayhem
card that he immediately uses to turn the following Perception roll into a
critical success, allowing him to find the mooks waiting in ambush and relay
their position to the rest of the unit.</p>

<p>Leto speaks first, and gets the drop on a mook not by being stealthy, but by
walking up to him and saying:</p>

<p><strong>Leto</strong>: Hello, good sir. I’m a doctor, and I couldn’t help but notice your
unhealthy pallor. Do you have a history of heart disease in your family?</p>

<p>I had him roll Deception, and the result was so high I ruled the guy lost an
action in surprise. So Leto sat on him.</p>

<p>The other mooks spring into action. One of them manages to shoot Leto for some
damage, and is vaporized by Orangus in return.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: You have a BH-209, right? The fusion reactor makes this <em>ominous
hummmmm</em> sound and a jet of plasma shoots forth. Where the enemy stood is now a
little pile of ash and a pair of smoking boots.</p>

<p><strong>Orangus</strong>: I LOVE MY JOB!!!<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>The two remaining guards suffer similar fates at the hands of the PCs’
fireteams, and once the survivor is interrogated he shows them the address of
the <em>real</em> hideout stored in his handbrain.</p>

<p>The group sends a picture of the guy to Skynet. Is he worth anything?</p>

<p><strong>Skynet</strong>: What you see here is a typical specimen of the common thug.</p>

<p>They tie him up and leave him for the police, which Skynet will call as soon as
the party is far enough away no one can pin this on them. They now know Kostavi
is on another warehouse on an even lower level of the city. Time to bag a
bounty!</p>

<h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s All, Folks!</h2>

<p>That’s where we stopped, since it was already noon. It’s fair to say everyone
had a blast. The “shout first, go first” initiative mechanic worked a lot better
than I thought it would, and the timing marks for the adventure were mostly
spot-on.</p>

<p>The Mayhem Deck was fun beyond all my expectations. The group got really lucky
with it too, drawing mostly good cards this time around. The <em>bad</em> cards did a
lot more to reshape the game and make everyone laugh, though. Let’s see how
funny they make the next session.</p>

<p>When will that be? I’m still not sure. We’re back to D&amp;D next week.  We might
alternate the two games, or wait until there’s another “gap”. I do know the
group wants to finish this adventure at some point. Orangus’ player bought the
corebook after this session, and we’ve been discussing the game online.</p>

<p>And yeah, the “Spin Control” effect happened here, giving the company +3
Reputation. We explained it as Orangus’ heroic stunt with the falling elevator
getting caught by various security cameras. Which he posed for.</p>
