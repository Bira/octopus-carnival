<p>Like millions of people worldwide, I’ve been playing Assassin’s Creed games for
a long time. One of the big draws of the games is all the cool gear you get to
use, and I often bounce a few ideas around the inside of my skull about how this
stuff would look on the tabletop. This is my first attempt at actually writing
it down. In this post in particular we’ll look at the equipment used by Altaïr
in the original Assassin’s Creed, using GURPS stats.</p>

<p>There’s one obvious Cool Gadget here, and we’ll get to it eventually, but the
rest of the equipment is surprisingly mundane considering the crazy stuff that
appears in later games.</p>

<h2 id="clothing-and-armor">Clothing And Armor</h2>

<p>Altaïr and the rest of the Assassins don’t seem to wear too much in
terms of armor, which makes sense since they’re portrayed as valuing stealth and
mobility. Armor is a mainstay for the opposition in this game, and it seems to
be portrayed in a historically accurate manner: check out GURPS Loadouts:
Low-Tech Armor p. 27-29 for a very detailed breakdown. In short, both the
Templars and Sarracens tend to wear DR 3 or 4 mail, with metal helmets.</p>

<p>The infamous hooded outfit (AKA the Menacing Hood) is probably not very
historical, since looking cool was a greater priority in its design than being
period-appropriate. There’s a million jokes out there about how absurd it is
that Altaïr can hide amidst the crowd at all while basically dressed as Medieval
Batman, but that’s clearly something the Assassins are supposed to be able to do
in-setting.</p>

<p>It would make sense for Assassin characters in a tabletop game to wear
<em>Undercover Clothing</em> (Low-Tech, p. 100). Altaïr’s iconic outfit isn’t quite
bulky enough to count as a Long Coat (Low-Tech, p. 99), but wearing one in
addition to the undercover clothes would definitely make sense for PC
Assassins. The total +5 or +6 bonus to Holdout would make hiding all those
weapons much easier!</p>

<h2 id="weapons">Weapons</h2>

<p>Assassin’s mostly fight with period-appropriate weapons. All the one-handed
swords seen in the game would use the stats for a broadsword (and the Broadsword
skill). Altaïr also gets access to a Long Knife, and to Small Throwing
Knives. The opposition uses the same sort of sword. Those enemies posted as
rooftop guards tend to carry Light Crossbows as well. You can find stats for
these and many other suitable TL 2-3 weapons in the Basic Set, Low-Tech, or
Martial Arts.</p>

<p>But that’s not what you’re here for, is it?</p>

<h3 id="the-hidden-blade">The Hidden Blade</h3>

<p>This marvel of Fantasy Tech-style engineering is a pure assassination weapon
unsuited to open combat. It consists of a leather and metal bracer with a
built-in, retractable knife blade. The spring-loaded mechanism is controlled by
a ring around the hand’s little finger, and the blade is concealed along the
underside of the arm. The model used in the original game can only be used by
someone who had amputated the ring finger on the corresponding hand.</p>

<p>The bracer is mostly leather covered with light metal plates that give DR 3 to
that forearm. While the blade is retracted, the user has a +5 bonus to Holdout
to conceal its nature as a weapon unless the people doing the searching know
exactly what to look for. Extending the blade usually takes a Ready action, but
the user can make a Fast-Draw (Knife) roll to do it instantly. Retracting the
blade is a free action: just relax your hand!</p>

<p>Stabbing with the Hidden Blade uses the Knife skill. It cannot parry, and counts
as Cheap quality for other breakage purposes. It’s different enough from a plain
old knife to inflict a -2 unfamiliarity penalty to both Knife and Fast-Draw on
users who haven’t trained with it before. Such a newbie would also probably lose
their ring finger the first time they extended the blade!</p>

            <p>In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Links to all of them will appear in the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">project page</a>, which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Thief, which means today’s character is Merisiel. Here
she is:</p>

<p>Merisiel has all the knives. <em>All of them</em>. We’re back in familiar territory
with her, as she’s one of the Iconics from the core book. Her bio is <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la5z?Meet-the-Iconics-Merisiel">here</a>
and her stats are <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/merisiel.html">here</a>. From these, we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Merisiel is one of the Forlorn, an elf raised among humans. They get this
depressing name because Pathfinder elves are of the type that takes nearly a
century to grow up. She spent these decades as a street urchin who stowed away
on ships bound for different cities when her current buddies outgrew her.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She’s not the sharpest knife in the drawer but makes up for that by carrying a
lot of really sharp knives on her person. She tries to start every combat
hidden, to better backstab her foes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Merisiel has an open and expressive personality, always tries to have fun in
the moment, and is always chasing the next get-rich-quick scheme.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Despite being pretty much a bog-standard d20/Pathfinder character, Merisiel
presents us with several interesting challenges when it comes to adapting her to
the Dungeon Fantasy RPG.</p>

<p>First of all, she’s an elf, but not the woodsy type of elf shown in DFRPG:
Adventurers. No, she’s a <em>Forlorn</em> elf, which means she grew up among humans and
had no contact with elven culture to speak of. The racial template from
Adventurers that best models this is actually the <em>Half-Elf</em>, down to the
problems they have in relating to both humans and elves. She’s not an actual
half-breed, but the effects of Social Stigman (Forlorn Elf) would be pretty much
the same. And theorietically she would have a much longer lifespan than a
half-elf, but that’s not worth any points in Dungeon Fantasy campaigns.</p>

<p>The other challenge is that the Thief professional template from Advanturers is
built to resemble the Thief class of early D&amp;D - a middling combatant who’s
great at stealth, trap-finding, and reaching difficult places. The d20 Rogue
class is still good at these non-combat things, but its main focus is stabbing
monsters in the back for massive damage. This is why Merisiel’s Pathfinder stats
give her a rapier despite her bio’s focus on knives - it’s the best melee weapon
for rogues in that system. Fortunately, the list of Thief-appropriate traits in
Adventurers gives us tools to fix this discrepancy.</p>

<p>As a result, Merisiel’s DX and IQ are both a point lower than you would expect
for an elf thief, to make room for the extra stabby (Ambidexterity, Weapon
Master, Expert Backstabber, and increased combat skills). She’s still quite a
bit sharper than her original bio indicates, though it might not be apparent to
someone who witnessed her failing two or more self-control rolls.</p>

<p>This version of Merisiel is almost identical to her GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
counterpart, with the biggest variation being her armor. She’s now at Light
Encumbrance, and must drop the backpack before entering a fight to avoid combat
penalties.</p>

<p>Our advancement options here are many. As a member of a “skill monkey”
profession Merisiel can always use more and higher skills. Players who want to
save points for a while might want to consider buying back that “lost” IQ
point for this reason. Those who want to make her stabbier would do well to add
a couple points of ST for that sweet 2d swing damage, and more Expert
Backstabber would make her sneak attacks even better. Spending treasure on a
lighter loadout and better-quality knives would also bring a lot of benefit to
the character.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my recent <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/04/06/quick-and-dirty-technical-grappling.md">Quick and Dirty Technical Grappling</a> post, the
biggest GURPS showstopper in my experience has been recalculating ST scores on
the fly, and this wasn’t only a Technical Grappling issue. Today I’ll try to
tackle the other rule where this issue has bit me: The Blessed (Heroic Feats)
advantage.</p>

<p>This is one of the most powerful Holy Warrior abilities in both versions of
Dungeon Fantasy, and it allows you to temporarily increase your ST, DX, or
HT. The problem here is that the increase is <em>variable</em>, expressed in dice (+1d
or +2d). It’s also an increase that applies to the <em>full</em> attribute, which means
the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing ST changes your HP, Basic Lift and base damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing DX changes your Basic Speed and potentially Move.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increasing HT changes your FP, your Basic Speed and potentially your Move.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Of these, the HP and FP changes are pretty straightforward. Basic Speed changes
are the next easiest to calculate on the fly, since each extra point of DX or HT
changes it by 0.25. Basic Lift is not too bad, since the formula for it is easy
to memorize (ST * ST/10 kg, or twice that in pounds).</p>

<p>But then you get to base damage, and the gears of your game grind to a halt
while you look it up in a table. Now, I’ve been dealing with GURPS for a number
of years now so I know that this table is in page 16 of the Basic Set, but
people who are new to the system won’t have that memorized. And knowing that
didn’t help me in the event that prompted me to write these articles, as I was
using the Dungeon Fantasy RPG and had to look up the table like anyone else who
is new to those books.</p>

<p>There is actually a specific algorithm for figuring out your change in basic
damage, but it’s fiddly enough that finding and consulting the table is usually
quicker. And whether you calculate or look up your new basic damage, you still
have use that to figure out the damage of your actual attacks, with things like
weapon modifiers, Weapon Master, or high Karate bonuses.</p>

<h2 id="my-solution-deterministic-heroic-feats">My Solution: Deterministic Heroic Feats</h2>

<p>The Heroic Feats advantage now increases your attribute by a fixed amount: 4 per
level. This still lasts for 3d seconds, to still keep the favor of the gods
<em>somewhat</em> fickle. GMs who want to get rid of that remaining bit of randomness
can just have it last 10 seconds instead.</p>

<p>When you take the Heroic Feats advantage, write down your new total stats
somewhere, and use those when the power is active.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: Our friend <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/10/13/pathfinder-dfrpg-holy-warrior.html">Seelah</a> has ST 13 and Heroic Might 1, so in a
separate space in her character sheet we record her stats with ST 17: Basic Lift
28.9kg and Damage 1d+2/3d-1. We also pre-calculate her enhanced sword damage (3d
cut or 1d+4 imp). When Seelah uses Heroic Might, we refer to those stats instead
of her usual ones.</p>

<p>If she later increases Heroic Might to its maximum level of 2, her enhanced
strength becomes 21, so we recalculate her secondary stats: Basic Lift 44.1kg
and Damage 2d/4d-1. Her sword damage becomes 4d cut or 2d+2 imp.</p>

<p>If later still she buys Weapon Master, we apply the damage bonuses from that
advantage to both sets of stats. Her normal sword damage becomes 2d+4 cut/1d+4
imp, and her enhanced sword damage becomes 4d+8 cut/2d+6 imp. Now that’s what I
call a smite!</p>

<p><strong>2018-04-09 Update</strong>: After receiving some feedback from Douglas Cole, who
wrote the original Technical Grappling rules, I’ve updated this article to
better handle people with wildly varying SMs and ST scores. I believe the
resulting rules can still be considered “Quick and Dirty” :).</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/04/02/my-gurps-house-rules.html">previous post</a>, I like the Technical Grappling rules on
principle but find them way too detailed for most games in practice. Here’s my
attempt to simplify them into something I can use.</p>

<p>My main goal here is to completely eliminate on-the-fly ST adjustments from the
game. In my experience, nothing has ever reduced the pacing of my games to a
screeching halt like having to look up someone’s new damage dice and recalculate
all their attacks. This is not just a Technical Grappling issue, but since that
is the topic of the day let’s stick to it.</p>

<p>Referred Control as written also has to go, because it involves a similar
amount of “recalculate everything right now”.</p>

<p>Any references to “the book” below refer to GURPS Technical Grappling, and the
“core rules” are the ones from GURPS Characters and Campaigns.</p>

<h2 id="trained-st">Trained ST</h2>

<p>This is <em>gone</em>. It’s one more thing to track for each individual skill and it
raises too slowly to make any difference for most games.</p>

<p>Use the Wrestling bonus from the core rules for that skill and ignore the
concept for the others. Buy Lifting ST instead.</p>

<h2 id="grappling-attacks-and-damage">Grappling Attacks and Damage</h2>

<p>Grappling still does Control Point damage, because that’s the core of the
system! CP damage is annotated as “control” in attack stat lines.</p>

<p>All unarmed grappling attacks inflict CP damage equal to the “thrust” value for
your ST. Lifting ST improves your ST for this purpose and so does the Wrestling
bonus when using that skill. Add +1 damage for each limb used beyond the first
two. If attacker’s SM is larger than that of the target, apply the difference as
a control damage bonus as well.</p>

<p>Armed grappling works mostly like in the book, except you always use your full
ST to calculate control damage. Entangling weapons use your <em>base</em> skill level
instead (not the effective one for that specific attack). This allows you to
write the control damage for your armed grapples <em>once</em> and not worry about it
later on, similar to how normal attacks work.</p>

<p>Any monster whose attacks “automatically count as a successful grapple” in
things like Dungeon Fantasy do linked control damage equal to the basic damage
of their attack. So if that Giant Enemy Crab has claws that do 2d+2 cut, they
now also do 2d+2 control!</p>

<p>Grapplers can still only maintain a maximum amount of CP equal to their ST.</p>

<h2 id="control-threshold">Control Threshold</h2>

<p>Every creature has a <em>Control Threshold</em> (CT) equal to their ST/5, rounded down
to the nearest whole number. This determines how easy it is to impair that
character’s movements via grappling. In relatively “realistic” games with
human-scale characters, 99% of people will have a CT of 2, and the remaining
slabs of pure muscle will have a CT of 3. Things can get quite a bit more varied
in Dungeon Fantasy or other fantastical games.</p>

<p>Write this down once during character creation, and only worry about changing it
if your permanent ST changes.</p>

<h2 id="effects-of-control-points">Effects of Control Points</h2>

<p>Every (CT) Control Points applied to a target translate into a -1 penalty to
DX<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If the target’s torso or head is being grappled this applies to all
their actions. If a limb is being grappled, the full penalty applies to any
actions involving that limb. Half the penalty applies to all other
actions. Treat grapples to multiple locations as a single grapple to the torso
with their combined CP.</p>

<p>In the example from page 6 of Technical grappling, that would give our pal
And’Rezik a total of 13 CP on his target. It’s only 2 CP less and you didn’t
need to halt your fight for 5 minutes to figure that out!</p>

<p>Control points can be spent in the same ways as in the book, and grappled
targets can attempt to erode them with their own grapple attacks subject to the
DX penalty, as usual.</p>

<h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s All, Folks!</h2>

<p>That’s pretty much it. I haven’t actually <em>tested</em> this system in play, but it’s
what I’m going to use in the next game I run where grappling is a thing. I’m
sure I’ve missed some edge cases from the original book, but if those ever
become a problem I’ll address them at that time.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As a way to get back into the habit of writing I thought I would expound a bit
on my preferred GURPS house rules. These are the modifications I make on every
campaign I GM. Some are tried-and-true, some are experimental, and one I haven’t
really used yet but intend to.</p>

<p>None of them are original creations, though. There’s so much stuff out there
already that I don’t feel inclined to come up with my own stuff.</p>

<h2 id="the-permanent-fixtures">The Permanent Fixtures</h2>

<p>These rules should be in effect in pretty much any game I GM.</p>

<h3 id="metric">Metric!</h3>

<p>If I have one complaint about GURPS is that it uses Imperial measurements for
everything. I don’t! I use metric instead. By now I’m pretty used to applying
simple conversions for lengths and weights.</p>

<p>Areas and volumes are more annoying, though I suspect <a href="http://bignose.whitetree.org/projects/gurps/house-rules.devel/gurps-metric.xhtml">this site</a> would help
me there. I don’t agree with <em>everything</em> on it (for example, I’m not rounding
Basic Lift to the nearest whole kilogram, that’s not granular enough), but it
does a good job overall.</p>

<h3 id="alternate-guns-specialties">Alternate Guns Specialties</h3>

<p>These are from Pyramid #3/65. It greatly simplifies the existing Guns
specialties, and I think it makes a lot of sense. I use it on any game that has
guns at all.</p>

<h2 id="occasional-appearances">Occasional Appearances</h2>

<p>These don’t always appear, but I like them nonetheless.</p>

<h3 id="complimentary-skills">Complimentary Skills</h3>

<p>This rule originally appeared on GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 2 and GURPS Action 2, and
was restated on Pyramid #3/70. It encourages teamwork, and gives heroes a bit of
an extra edge in general. It hasn’t appeared in all of my games because people
rarely think to invoke this rule, but if anyone asks whether they can use it the
answer is always “yes”.</p>

<h3 id="tactics-for-the-win">Tactics For the Win</h3>

<p>This originally appeared in GURPS Martial Arts. It allows the Tactics skill to
grant rerolls when not using tactical maps, or to enable tricky positioning
shenanigans when using them. It makes playing “warlord” characters mechanically
viable, and the only reason it’s not a permanent fixture is that people don’t
always make those types of character.</p>

<h3 id="team-efforts">Team Efforts</h3>

<p>Another one from Action and Dungeon Fantasy. It simplifies group tests.</p>

<h3 id="range-bands">Range Bands</h3>

<p>This is from GURPS Action. It’s a lot easier to use than the Size/Speed range
table for combats without a map! In practice it mostly means giving nearly
everyone a -3 penalty for ranged attacks and calling it a day, since combats in
my games rarely happen further away 20m that even when everyone has guns.</p>

<h2 id="experiments-tried-and-untried">Experiments, Tried and Untried</h2>

<p>These are rules I <em>want</em> to use more often, but I still don’t feel I’m good
enough at applying them to so in every game.</p>

<h3 id="technical-grappling-simplified">Technical Grappling, Simplified.</h3>

<p>This is obviously from GURPS Technical Grappling. I like the basic idea of the
Technical Grappling system, but as written it’s way too complex to use in any
game that is not entirely about playing through an entire MMA tournament at a
high level of detail.</p>

<p>I would like to keep the central mechanic where grapplers to “control damage”
according to their skill and strength, and where this damage makes it
increasingly harder for the opponent to move. Referred Control has to <em>go</em>,
however, and I strongly dislike the idea of adjusting people’s ST mid-fight. I’m
also not too keep on calculating multiple ST scores for every possible
combination of limbs you’re using for a grapple.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’m strongly tempted to buy Douglas Cole’s Dungeon Grappling
supplement for D&amp;D-alikes and port it back to GURPS, since it seems to do lot of
what I described above already. However, now that I’ve discovered that the
<a href="http://www.sjgames.com/ill/archive/April_01_2018/Announcing_Hall_of_Judgment_for_Dungeon_Fantasy_RPG">official GURPS conversion of his Hall of Tyr adventure</a> is real, I’ll
probably wait for that instead. In the meantime I might work something out on my
own.</p>

<h3 id="hybrid-ritual-path-magic">Hybrid Ritual Path Magic</h3>

<p>I’m a big fan of the Ritual Path Magic system as described in, well, GURPS
Ritual Path Magic. I like the energy accumulation model and the flexibility it
allows. That book is more geared towards settings where magic is rare and/or
hidden, though, which means it tends to limit magic by what is “mundanely
possible” in the setting in question. You can exceed those limits with Greater
effects, but it’s expensive.</p>

<p>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 19: Incantation Magic describes a variant of this system
meant to fit a D&amp;D-like setting, where magic is known and common. The limits it
imposes are a lot less fuzzy (you can do <em>this</em> much damage, or give <em>this</em> big
a bonus). The exact amounts are dependent on Magery and there are no Greater
effects that allow you to exceed them. That’s good for my purposes, but
unfortunately the system is based on an “effect shaping” model where spells give
you more skill penalties the more powerful they are.</p>

<p>What I want here is a hybrid system, one that’s based on energy but also geared
towards obvious-magic settings. What I’d do here is basically use the system
from RPM with the Magery-based limits from DF, and the removal of Greater
effects. I haven’t tested this in actual play with real players, but I would
like to.</p>
