<p>The book says spined devils serve as “scouts and sentries” in the Hells, and
sometimes as “spies and messengers” to powerful figures. Everything else about
them suggests they are <em>terrible</em> at these jobs, because what they really love
is flying around in bands and tormenting anything that crosses their path with a
rain of flaming, poisonous spines.</p>

<p>Also known as spinagons, they’re frequently summoned both because their relative
weakness makes the process easy, and because they’ll do what the summoner says
as long as they’re given ample opportunity to fling spines at people.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Spinagons exist only in the Monster Manual. They’re Medium Immortal Humanoids
(devils), and Level 6 Skirmishers with 70 HP. Like most other devils, they have
darkvision and 20 fire resistance. Their ground speed is 5, and they’re nimble
fliers with speed 7 and the ability to hover.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a claw, and their <em>favorite</em> attack is the Rain of Spines
I keep mentioning. A spinagon can fling the spines covering its body at victims
by flexing real hard. These have Range 10 and target Reflex. They do a mix of
physical and fire damage on a hit, and trigger a secondary attack against
Fortitude that slows and does ongoing poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>The spines actually do the right amount of damage on average, though it’s
expressed a bit differently than you’d expect (1d10 physical + 1d6 fire + 5
ongoing poison). The fix here would be to remove the secondary attack against
Fortitude and have the ongoing damage and slow happen on any hit from the
spines. That would make these kinda scary for a level-appropriate party, since
getting hit with the spines makes it harder for someone to get away from future
shots.</p>

<p>The claws do need a handful more damage, but like all artillery monsters you’ll
only be using their melee basic attack if you mess up.</p>

<p>The sample encounter in the book is level 6: two spinagons and a trio of
lizardfolk composed of a mystic and two bruisers. A pretty effective formation,
and a clue to a diabolist cult growing in the depths of the swamp.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Spinagons feel a bit underwhelming as a follow-up to pit fiends. Not only are
their stats really simple, their looks, disposition and attack forms would all
fit a <em>demon</em> better than a <em>devil</em>. They fight with natural weapons,
have animalistic traits, and like to kill people for the lulz.</p>

<p>Still, if you pair them with appropriate enemies that can capitalize on the slow
effect of their spines, they can make for memorable fights. The sample encounter
is a good example of this… and to make my point about these guys looking more
like demons, they also pair really well with evistros.</p>

<p>Pit fiends are the lords, barons, viziers and generals of the Nine Hells. In
other words, its upper management, just below the VPs (the archdevils) and the
CEO (Asmodeus). As such, they’re both on the Monster Manual and on the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Each of the archdevils commands no more than a dozen or so pit fiends, each of
whom fulfills an important role in the workings of that layer, commanding a
whole army of lesser devils. The impression I get is that the Lords of the Nine
are much more concerned with internecine political struggles than with actually
running the business, so most of those diabolical schemes the PCs find
themselves fighting are actually hatched by pit fiends and carried out by those
lesser devils under them.</p>

<p>Pit fiends don’t usually get involved in the schemes they manage. They only show
up in person when a big scheme is about to succeed… or when a band of plucky
adventurers is about to seriously mess it up. When they do show up, they bring
not only their own considerable power to bear, but also a number of backup plans
and dirty tricks. Your typical pit fiend has Int 22, making it much smarter than
its demonic counterpart, the Balor.</p>

<p>We’ll take a look at each version of the pit fiend separately, as there are some
significant differences between them. In both cases they’re Large Immortal
Humanoids (devils), and Level 26 Elite Soldiers (Leaders) with 486 HP.</p>

<h2 id="pit-fiend-monster-manual">Pit Fiend (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual pit fiend has darkvision, Fire Resistance 30, and Poison
Resistance 15. It fast as, well, a bat out of hell, running and flying at speed
12 (the latter with clumsy maneuverability). It can also teleport 10 squares at
will.</p>

<p>The fiend projects auras of fear and fire out to 5 squares. Both affect only
enemies caught inside, with the first inflicting a -2 penalty to all attacks and
the other doing 15 fire damage per turn.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 2 Flametouched Mace, which does both instant and
ongoing fire damage. If you add both up, then you get a figure that’s actually
appropriate for a monster of this level! The fiend can also attack with its
Reach 2 tail sting, which does a bit less physical damage and allows a secondary
attack against Fortitude for a bit more ongoing poison damage plus weakness
(save ends both). As an elite monster, the pit fiend can use a standard action
to attack both with the mace and with the tail sting at once.</p>

<p>Its “leaderly” ability is Tactical Teleport, which takes a standard action and
recharges on 4-6. This teleports two allies up to 10 squares away from the fiend
to any other square in that same radius. Instant flanking!</p>

<p>It has two minor actions. The first is the ability to create a Point of Terror
in someone’s mind, a Ranged 5 attack that targets Will and inflicts a -5 penalty
to all defenses for a turn. The second is the Irrestistible Command, which
targets a lower level devil within 10 squares, slides it 5 squares, and causes
it to explode and automatically deal some fire damage to everyone in a close
burst 2.</p>

<p>Oh, and remember how fiends of all kinds in previous editions had the ability to
summon others of their kind somewhat randomly? The MM pit fiend can still do
that with a 100% chance success, once per encounter. The fiend can call up
either 8 legion devil legionnaires, 2 war devils, or 4 legionnaires and 1 war
devil. These are always explicitly an add-on to whatever encounter group the pit
fiend is originally part of, and they’re <em>not</em> worth extra XP. While none of
these are as individually powerful as the fiend itself, War Devils are strong
enough to be concerning and the legionnaires make wonderful fodder for
Irresistible Command.</p>

<p>Pit fiends start any fight they engage in by summoning reinforcements, because
why wouldn’t they? They then use Tactical Teleport to set up some flanking
situations, soften targets up with Point of Terror, and then charge into the
fray to bash and sting fools to death.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 25: 1 Pit Fiend, 2 war devils, 2 astral stalkers,
and 1 marut concordant. This doesn’t include the pit fiend’s summoned
reinforcements! A harrowing boss battle for level a level 22 party, and the GM
gets to come up with a fun reason for the marut and abominations to be working
with devils. It’s not <em>implausible</em>, it just demands some backstory.</p>

<h2 id="pit-fiend-monster-vault">Pit Fiend (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The Monster Vault pit fiend has exactly the same resistances, senses, and
movement modes as the Monster Manual version. Its Aura of Fear is a bit
different, marking all targets caught within it instead of giving them a general
-2 penalty to attacks. The fire aura is the same.</p>

<p>The Flaming Mace attack is the first attack I see on a MV monster that has the
exact same damage as it did on the MM! Clearly ongoing damage is supposed to be
always be included in the average damage for the monster’s level. Makes sense,
as it will almost always get applied at least once.</p>

<p>The tail sting has been simplified into a single attack that targets Fortitude,
deals <em>25</em> ongoing poison damage and weakens (save ends both). The original only
dealt 15, which was typical for epic monsters. 25 ongoing poison denotes a
“blood of the Lernean Hydra” level of toxicity. The pit fiend remains able to
make both a mace and a stinger attack as a single standard action.</p>

<p>The damage from the Irresistible Command explosion has increased a bit, and
remains automatic. It also retains the use of Tactical Teleport, which remains
identical.</p>

<p>The other big change here is that the summoning ability is gone. This is
understandable, as it wreaks all sorts of havoc with 4e’s carefully tuned
encounter design rules. In its place is Nightmarish Punishment, which triggers
every time an enemy within 2 squares tries to shift or make an attack that
doesn’t target the pit fiend. The fiend gets to make what amounts to a free mace
attack against the target, only it slides them adjacent to the fiend instead of
dealing ongoing fire damage. No escape!</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I find it inevitable to compare pit fiends to balors, since both are technically
the strongest creatures in their respective factions that don’t get individual
names and backstories in the books.</p>

<p>If you look only at their individual stats, I think Balors feel scarier in
personal combat. They have more HP, variable resistance, and their direct
attacks do more damage. Still, pit fiends put up a respectable show in that
department, and are much more capable of acting as a force multiplier for
whatever other monsters are fighting with them. As with all devils, team
composition is vital to make a combat encounter seem dangerous and scary. Even
without the summoning ability, I’d encourage GMs to make pit fiend fights
include a very large number of opponents, and have some of those appear by being
summoned mid-fight.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>The devil entries in both books make frequent mention of the “Legions of Hell”,
and now we finally get to see who it is they’re talking about. They exist in
both the Monster Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The creatively named legion devils make up the bulk of those legions. They’re
kinda like the perfect ideal of the totalitarian soldier, as they don’t have
much in the way of personal initiative or even personality. They live to obey
their commanders, and will gladly give their lives if for the glory of Hell
ordered to do so.</p>

<p>If you keep following the corporate analogy I’ve been using you’d be tempted to
equate legion devils to the many salaried employees who fill cubicles and mail
rooms in any giant corporation, but the truth is they’re not very like those
people at all. They’re a lot closer to the dystopian notion of a “resource”:
numbers on a balance sheet, undiferentiated and replacable. Managers spend them
to achieve their quarterly goals and can always get more where those come
from. And they’ll never complain about any of this, because they’re happy to
serve the goals of President Asmodeus.</p>

<p>In fact, all this grim thinking reminds me of several discussions I’ve been
seeing on RPG.net lately where some people say humanoids like orcs and kobolds
aren’t acceptable “kill on sight” monsters, while others do a bit of contortion
to figure out a scenario where they would be because it’s traditional. Me, I say
that if you need an army of faceless minions who are never up to any good and
whom you should always fight with all your might, you should drop humanoids
entirely and look to these guys. Well, to all devils and demons, really, but
fighting devils-as-symbols-of-totalirarianism specifically feels a little more
satisfying to me these days.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Legion Devils are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils), and are always
minions. More specifically, they’re minion Soldiers even though the first
Monster Manual didn’t assign subtypes to minions.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual gives us Legion Devil Grunts, Hellguards, Veterans, and
Legionnaires, which are level 6, 11, 16 and 21 respectively. The Vault has
updated versions of the Hellguard and Veteran. All versions in the same book are
pretty much identical aside from level, and it’s pretty easy to level any one of
them up or down to the exact level you need if none of the ready-made ones is
appropriate.</p>

<p>Legion devils are armed with longswords and heavy shields, and wear plate. They
have darkvision and a fire resistance of 5 per tier (i.e, 5 at level 1-10, 10 at
11-20 and 15 at 21-30). They run with speed 6 (level 15-) or 7 (16+), and
teleport with speed 3 at all levels. They gain a +2 bonus to all their defenses
if adjacent to another legion devil.</p>

<p>Their longsword attacks suffer from the damage bug in the Monster Manual
versions. The Vault versions fix this, and also do aditional damage to targets
that willingly move in their next action. When building your own legion devils,
you should use this version of their basic attack.</p>

<p>This indicates to me that despite being expendable minions, legion devils fight
in a very coordinated fashion, teleporting short distances to gain combat
advantage and using their attacks to keep enemies locked in place and allow
their bosses to focus fire on the biggest threats.</p>

<p>The sample encounters in the MM are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 4 legion devil grunts, 2 tiefling heretics, 2 tiefling
darkblades. Your basic diabolist cult and its summoned muscle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 21: 8 legion devil legionnaires, 2 ice devils, and 1 war devil. An
infernal princeling and his personal security detail.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>There isn’t much <em>actual</em> flavor in the book entry for legion devils, but for
some reason they ended up sparking my imagination and giving rise to the rant
you see up there in the Lore section. In a game focused on fighting devils,
I’d definitely make regular versions of them for use as low-to-mid Heroic tier
opponents, and the minion versions would be a constant presence in the rest of
the campaign.</p>

<p>If bone and ice devils are management, then imps are door-to-door salesmen. Evil
and evil-curious spellcasters love the little jerks. They’re always willing to
bargain for infernal secrets of power, and look too weak to pull a fast one. Of
course, that’s just how the imps and their bosses want it.</p>

<p>Left to their own devices, imps love tricking mortals into hurting one another,
which is made easier by the fact that they’re pixie-sized, can fly and turn
invisible at will. They’ll remain on any given fight only as long as they have
the upper hand, and will run away as soon as the tables turn.</p>

<p>Imps exist both on the Monster Vault and on the Monster Manual, but the two
versions are more or less equivalent. They’re Tiny Immortal Humanoids (devils),
which means they’re around 6-12 inches tall - pixie-sized, as I said.</p>

<p>Both imp versions are Level 3 Lurkers with 40 HP. They have darkvision, Resist
15 fire, run at speed 4, and fly at speed 6 with hover capability. They’re
trained in Perception, Arcana, Bluff and Stealth. The main differences are on
the imp’s attacks, which we’ll discuss below.</p>

<h2 id="imp-monster-manual">Imp (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The MM Imp’s basic attack is a bite that does so little damage it’s noticeable
even on a level 3 monster. It also has a tail stinger that’s slightly more
accurate, does a bit more damage, and has a secondary attack against Fortitude
that on a hit does ongoing 5 poison damage and imposes a -2 penalty to Will
(save ends). Both are Reach 0, which means the imp has to be occupying the same
square as its target to use them. It can do that because it’s Tiny.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the imp can also Vanish as a standard action, which turns it
invisible for a turn or until it attacks. Using this also recharges the tail
stinger, which firmly establishes the imp’s Lurker routine: vanish, sting,
repeat.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 3: an imp and a whole lotta goblins, including a
gobling hexer. The hexer is exactly the sort of caster who’d summon himself an
imp familiar.</p>

<h2 id="imp-monster-vault">Imp (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The MV imp has the same attacks as the original, but they’ve all been
significantly improved.</p>

<p>Both the bite and the stinger have Reach 1 now, and do damage appropriate for a
level 3 monster. The venom no longer requires a secondary attack, and does <em>10</em>
ongoing poison damage while keeping its Will penalty. That’s a lot for a level 3
regular!</p>

<p>Vanish still works like it did before, but its text has been made more
“technical”, saying that the invisibility is dispelled when the imp “hits or
misses” with an attack. This is actually important, because it means the monster
can make that attack while invisible and will only appear <em>after</em> it resolves
the whole thing. You can’t see it coming beforehand, or hope to interrupt its
attack by readying an action for when it becomes visible.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Imps are kind of living Team Evil membership cards. If you want a character to
come off as an obvious villain, give them an imp familiar or servant. They’re
also quite a bit smaller than I thought at first.</p>

<p>Mechanically, you should definitely go with the Monster Vault version. It
retains the same flavor but is much better executed. While imp combat stats lack
the pile of spell-like abilities they had in previous editions, it makes perfect
sense for imps to have access to a variety of infernally-flavored rituals, and
possibly for them to be able to cast them at a higher level than 3.</p>

<p>If you miss fireball-chucking imps, you could make artillery and/or elite
versions that have similar combat powers.</p>

<p>Ice devils are native to Cania, the frozen eight layer of Hell. Also known as
Gelugons, they have an insectoid look which is significantly different from the
norm for devils. This makes me think they were a different type of creature than
most other rebellious divine servants (who were likely angels or such).</p>

<p>Individually they’re quite powerful, and hierarchically they’re starting to hit
“upper management” territory. Gelugons don’t just allow themselves to be
summoned by <em>anyone</em>. Their usual clients include evil rulers or generals. They
usually function as champions, elite guards, and troop commanders.</p>

<p>Unfortunately ice devils are not all that good at this command business, because
their disdain for their subordinates makes them favor high-attrition wave
tactics. Well, unfortunately for those subordinates of course. Gelugons must
think it’s really fun. Think “40K Imperial Guard Officer” when roleplaying them
and you won’t go wrong.</p>

<p>They like cold climates, but aren’t impaired by warmer ones as they take a bit
of Cania’s cold with them wherever they go. They like to fight in the front
lines even when commanding others, and will prefer to target the weakest
opponents first both because that’s tactically sound and because they despise
weakness.</p>

<p>Gelugons are present in both the Monster Manual and the Vault, and there are
signifitant differences between the two versions. We’ll cover them separately.</p>

<p>In both cases they’re Large Immortal Humanoids, have the Evil alignment (like
all devils), Int 15, and speak Supernal.</p>

<h2 id="ice-devil-monster-manual">Ice Devil (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The MM ice devil is a Level 20 Soldier with 195 HP. It has darkvision and runs
at speed 8. It’s completely immune to cold, and has Resist Fire 20. Pretty much
all of its powers are tagged with the Cold keyword.</p>

<p>First there’s the Cold Aura, which has a radius of 5 and gives enemies inside a
-2 penalty to attack rolls. Then there’s the Icy Longspear, a Reach 3 basic
attack that does cold damage and slows on a hit (save ends). Freezing Breath
targets Fortitude on a close blast 5, does cold damage and slows (save ends). It
recharges on 3-6. And finally there’s Chilling Command, a minor action that
recharges on 5-6 and targets Will. On a hit it does ongoing 5 cold damage and
immobilizes (save ends both).</p>

<p>5 ongoing damage is low for an almost-epic creature. I imagine this is
counterbalanced by the immobilization and this being a minor action. I’d
increase it to 10 or 15 anyway, as well as fixing the woefully low damage of all
the other attacks above.</p>

<p>Oh, these things also have claws, but they’re so bad as an attack that you might
as well ignore them. Devils use weapons.</p>

<p>The sample encounter here level 19: 2 ice devils, 2 cambion hellfire magi, and 2
nabassu gargoyles. Hard to say who’s in charge on that one. I’m guessing it’s a
very tense relationship between the gelugons and the cambions, all of whom are
under orders from some epic-level villain to cooperate or else.</p>

<h2 id="ice-devil-monster-vault">Ice Devil (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The MV ice devil has the same level, HP and defenses as the previous
version. The main difference are its attacks.</p>

<p>The puny claws are gone, as is Chilling Command. The damage on the Icy Longspear
and Freezing Breath has been fixed and further increased for the breath, which
now recharges on a 4-6. The spear now marks for a turn instead of slowing, and
the first failed save on the breath’s slow effect increases it to
immobilization.</p>

<p>The Cold Aura has been replaced by a new Aura 2 named Crippling Cold, which
slows for a turn any enemies who start their turns inside it. And finally, the
gelugon has replaced its fire resistance with a weakness to fire! Every time it
takes fire damage, its Crippling Cold aura deactivates until the ice devil
reactivates it. I <em>guess</em> that’s a minor action? It should at least be something
it can only do on its turn.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think I actually like the MM version a bit more here. Chilling command is
flavorful, and having the monster be both immune to cold and highly resistant to
fire can lead to a nice “gotcha” moment while still being easier to remember
than 3e devil resistances.</p>

<p>So to make my “optimal” gelugon I would start from the MV stat block, remove
Warming Weakness, add the 20 fire resistance, and the Chilling Command power.</p>
