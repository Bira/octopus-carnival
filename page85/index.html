        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>If you’ve been reading this blog for a while, you’ll know that I’ve already
converted no less than eleven Pathfinder Iconic characters to Dungeon Fantasy,
one for each of the templates from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 1:
Adventurers</strong>. You’ll also know that you can find a handy list of all of them
in <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">this page</a>, which declares that the project as a whole is done. So why
the heck are you seeing yet another of these articles here?</p>

<p>Well, the simplest reason is because I wanted to do another one. Consider this a
bonus track for the Pathfinder Iconics in Dungeon Fantasy album! As such, it
doesn’t quite follow the rules I set for myself in the main set of eleven
iconics.</p>

<p>You see, our subject today is Seoni the Sorceress. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Seoni.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2007 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I have to say this isn’t one of Wayne Reynolds’ best efforts, since the
proportions and the pose are a bit weird. That aside, Seoni stands out among the
Iconics in that she shows quite a bit of skin, tough at least her bio gives us a
reason for that. That bio is somewhat split between the page containing her
<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/seoni.html">d20 stats</a> and this <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la75?Meet-the-Iconics-Seoni">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>As the Iconic Sorcerer, Seoni represents a class that’s present in the
Pathfinder <em>and</em> d20 core rules, but absent from <strong>DF 1</strong>, which had the
Swashbuckler instead. It’s not hard to see why: any of the “traditional”
spellcasters from <strong>DF 1</strong> are already about as versatile as a d20 Sorcerer. It
would be a while until GURPS had an officially published template that had the
same relationship to the other spellcasters as their d20 counterparts. That
template turned out to be the aptly-named Sorcerer from <strong>Pyramid #3/82</strong>, which
in turn uses rules from <strong>GURPS Thaumathology: Sorcery</strong>.</p>

<p>So now that I’ve explained my reasoning, let’s look at what we can learn from
Seoni’s bio and stats.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>She comes from the land of Varisia, and belongs to the nomadic culture of its
original inhabitants. This culture is roughly analogous to the Romani of our
world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to her mystical bloodline, Seoni has experienced mysterious visions since
a very young age, and her quest to understand those has led to the awakening
of her powers. The tatoos covering most of her body are both a status symbol
in her culture and a focus for her magic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seoni’s obsession with being in control of her own fate combines with her
penchant for detailed plans to make her look like a “control freak” to her
companions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is <em>extremely</em> blasty. The vast majority of her abilities deal direct
damage, usually with fire or lightning. The rest are either straightforward
combat debuffs (<em>glitterdust</em>, <em>dispel magic</em>) or energy barriers (<em>mage
armor</em>, <em>shield</em>, <em>wall of force</em>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our version of Seoni certainly manages to uphold the “less known spells cast
more frequently” motto of the d20 Sorcerer. She knows all of four spells, but
she can cast all of them all day long without even spending FP as long as she
can both move and speak when she does so. She can only use one of them at a
time, but Accelerated Casting allows her to switch effects without pausing. She
can do passably well at social endeavors with her training in Diplomacy and her
Charisma, and can improvise any minor spell with a full cost of 7 points or
less, but what she’s really good at is spamming lightning bolts all day, every
day.</p>

<p>As for power-ups, she can always use more Sorcery spells! Her mundane skills are
lacking a bit, so any spare points there also help. Those players willing to
save points for a while can fully master Dispel Magic for an additional 48
points, which would enable Seoni to cast and maintain 2 effects at once.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/01/03/x-com-post-mortem.html">big post-mortem</a> on the Noises in the Dark campaign setting seems to
have been relatively well-received, and I’ve been in search of subjects to talk
about, so I’m going to make that campaign A Thing here in Octopus Carnival. I’ll
post a few more specific descriptions of my setup and play reports for the
actual field missions!</p>

<p>This will break up the blog’s so far relentless stream of fantasy posts with
some modern articles, and give me something to write about that’s easier to do
than coming up with stats for Dragon’s Dogma Bestiary monsters. After all,
everything that’s here already happened. I’m not sure I can post the GURPS stats
I made up for the Dreams of Ruin monsters or their environmental effects, but
pretty much everything else should be fair game. If you really want to see those
stats then <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/152691/The-Dreams-of-Ruin">throw some money in Mr. Grabowski’s direction</a> so the material
can be freed earlier!</p>

<p>In this post I’ll try to expand a bit on the basic setup for the X-COM side of
the campaign, since that part is all me.</p>

<h2 id="step-one-recruitment">Step One: Recruitment</h2>

<p>This was a forum-based game on RPG.net, so the first thing I did was to put up a
recruitment thread. I laid out the basic premise of the game: it’s GURPS X-COM,
with soldier PCs and occasional “strategic” interludes where the players
themselves made decisions for the organization. Prospective players should post
character concepts, and I would choose which ones would fill the group.</p>

<p>Recruitment was <em>not</em> on a first-come, first-served basis, as I had been burned
in the past by doing that and ending up with one or more severely disrupting
players. The lot I got from this round of recruitment was pretty nice, though!</p>

<p>Two of them would end up bailing out from the game before their first
in-character post, but I wasn’t too upset with that - it’s pretty much the cost
of doing business in forum games. I always recruit a number of players slightly
higher than what I think I can easily handle for this reason.</p>

<p>Obviously if you’re planning on replicating this campaign in a face to face
game, you wouldn’t have this issue.</p>

<h2 id="step-two-choose-your-destiny">Step Two: Choose Your Destiny</h2>

<p>Once the initial group of players had been locked down, I presented them with a
series of decisions that would shape the campaign to come.</p>

<h3 id="choose-your-enemy">Choose Your Enemy</h3>

<p>As stated in the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/01/03/x-com-post-mortem.html">post-mortem</a>, this was a choice between the original alien
enemies of the X-COM games, and the Dreams of Ruin. There isn’t much to say
about the former, as they weren’t chosen and I never developed them beyond this
initial concept.</p>

<p>Choosing the Dreams meant that the initial incidents X-COM was created to
investigate had more to do with traditional horror stories about fairies and
witches than they did with classic UFO mythology. Strange things silhouetted
against the moon, people vanishing into the woods, and a particularly notable
incident where all the medical drugs stored in a hospital in Cologne went bad at
once for no readily apparent reason.</p>

<h3 id="choose-your-leaders">Choose your Leaders</h3>

<p>In response to this, a group of 36 nations founded the Council and pooled their
resources to form X-COM. The idea behind the Council is nice: the nations of
Earth gather together to repel a global threat! The reality is a little darker,
as despite all delegates theoretically having the same amount of decision power,
the richer members contribute with more money and see themselves as entitled to
more influence. The ruling elites of each country also simply cannot resist
using this clandestine military and intelligence organization to handle private
issues that have little to do with aliens.</p>

<p>These negative tendencies are greatly amplified by having the Dreams of Ruin as
the Enemy, since one of their main effects is to amplify negative emotions in
their affected area. From the start I planned to have the corruption in the
Council nations to play an important role in the story.</p>

<p>There were fierce debates among the Council members over who would be its
commanding officer. Sure, they all wanted someone who could get the job done,
but they were also looking out for the interests of their specific
nations. Finally it came down to two choices:</p>

<p>The first was “Mr. Fox”, an American with a long list of shady black ops in his
curriculum, in places like the Middle East and the Balkans. He actually went
missing for years to get away from all that stuff, and they only managed to
bring him back because the fate of the world literally depended on it. He’s
pretty much a Big Boss expy. He has a reputation of taking good care of his men,
recruiting the best and giving them top of the line training. The downside is
that a lot of Council members don’t like him very much, and he has no time to
spare sucking up to them.</p>

<p>The second was “Mr. Smiley”, a well-connected member of the British intelligence
community. He brings from that line of business the idea that human assets are
expendable if it means the success of the mission. As such, his agents are
individually less well-trained than Fox’s would be, but there are more of
them. And his connections mean the Council loves him, in no small part because
he promises to look out for several of its member nations’ private interests. He
is, of course, a George Smiley expy.</p>

<p>In game terms, the players were given the chance to vote for one of the two
candidates. Choosing Fox meant the PCs would be built on 250 points, and would
get extensive drone and robot support once that became available in the tech
tree. It also meant that X-COM would eventually have a nasty falling out with
the Council, due to his inability to stay on good terms with them by playing
along with the corruption present there. As they would still be the only ones
with any real chance against the threat, they would be forced to go rogue.</p>

<p>Choosing Smiley meant that the PCs would be built on 150 points, and would be
part of a larger unit with several other NPCs. The opposition wouldn’t get any
weaker, which meant that unit would almost certainly face significant casualties
when it fought the aliens. Some of their missions wouldn’t involve aliens at
all, but would instead be about doing dirty jobs for one member nation or
another. This X-COM would be very well-funded, but less effective at combating
the Dreams. The “big falling out” here would ideally be between the PCs and the
organization.</p>

<p>Whatever commander they chose would lead X-COM, and the other would vanish from
the game… or so the players thought. The commander they <em>didn’t</em> choose would
go on to form a rogue organization that would make an appearance later. Yes,
this would be a version of EXALT from the 2012 computer game. Or rather,
X-ALT. The hyphens are important!</p>

<p>They chose Mr. Fox, which meant Mr. Smiley went into the cold to form his black
ops squad in the service of those corrupt special interests in the Council
nations. This makes X-ALT a “bad guy” faction.</p>

<h3 id="choose-your-science">Choose Your Science</h3>

<p>The players were similarly given three choices of Lead Scientist for X-COM:
Dr. Moira Vahlen, Dr. Raymond Shen, and Dr. Yuri Sokolov.</p>

<p>The first two were taken straight from the 2012 computer game. Here, Vahlen is a
German doctor and particularly skilled in the biological sciences. Shen is a
Chinese engineer and skilled in robotics. Sokolov, the original character, is a
Russian and also a doctor, but his main area of interest is paranormal
research - no one alive knows more about all those weird Soviet psychic research
programs than him.</p>

<p>Any of the three would be equally adept at leading X-COM’s research efforts, and
their different areas of expertise translated into different “free” starting
technologies as the new lead scientist used the organization’s resources to turn
their previous research into something useful in fighting aliens. Vahlen would
give them advanced medkits; Shen would give them flying scout drones.</p>

<p>They chose Sokolov, who was a bit of a special case. He spends that time
convincing his colleagues that he’s not a useless crackpot, so there’s no
bonus tech… but he turns out to be just perfect for leading research into
Alien Crazy, which in this case means <em>magic</em>.</p>

<p>Unlike the choice of commander, all three scientists are part of the team
regardless, along with a number of other nameless NPCs - this is just to decide
who calls the shots.</p>

<h2 id="step-three-hurry-up-and-wait">Step Three: Hurry Up and Wait</h2>

<p>With all the choices made, X-COM installed itself in its brand new underground
base in the remodeled Cheyenne Mountain complex, and began scanning the skies
for the alien menace… only to find nothing for a whole month. At the end of
that month something remarkable happened, but I’ll leave that for the next post
on this subject. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Today is Valentine’s Day in the US, so this is me making eyes at you. Not that
kind of eyes, though.</p>

<p>In Dragon’s Dogma, the creatures known as Eyes are pure monsters: they have no
natural habitat or ecological niche. They are an expression of corruption from
beyond the Rift, appearing only in places where the world’s veil is thin and
supernatural evil is abundant. While they are living creatures, their forms and
anatomy don’t even pay lip service to normal phisiological principles. Tough
highly intelligent, they never communicate or negotiate, and always try to kill
non-Eyes that run into them.</p>

<p>They come in several varieties, all of which share some of the characteristics
of the Eye of Death found in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 1</strong>, p. 14. In fact, the
Eye of Death could easily be another member of the this monster family.</p>

<p><strong>Update (2017-02-21)</strong>: The Gazer has its own stat block now, and is even
nastier with the addition of a couple more gaze attacks.</p>

<h2 id="vile-eyes">Vile Eyes</h2>

<p>The smallest of the bunch, Vile Eyes look like fleshy spheres with a single
lidless eye always staring ahead. While they are not as agile or perceptive as
an Eye of Death, they share the same death gaze ability and can protect
themselves with a nigh-impenetrable energy barrier. Fortunately for their
victims, they can’t do both of those things at the same time. Switching from the
barrier to one of the other powers and back requires a Concentrate maneuver,
giving the PCs a window in which to hit them.</p>

<p>Unlike their larger cousins described in this article, Vile Eyes are usually
found in small groups. Despite their small amount of HP, they are usually
worthies.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 5; <strong>DX</strong> 10; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> -1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 8; <strong>DR</strong> 0;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 10; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 10</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 5.5; <strong>Move</strong> 5 (Air).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Magic Barrier (-)</strong>: Gives the Vile Eye DR 30 and Magic Resistance 10 while
up.</li>
  <li><strong>Death Gaze (Resisted by HT-5)</strong>: 1d toxic damage. Range 20. Cosmic, ignores
DR.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 5; Dark Vision (Color Vision); Doesn’t Breathe; Doesn’t
Eat or Drink; Doesn’t Sleep; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards; Injury Tolerance (No
Brain, No Neck, No Vitals);</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Elder Thing.</p>

<h2 id="evil-eyes">Evil Eyes</h2>

<p>Not to be confused with Vile Eyes, these things are leathery spheres over three
meters in diameter whose body is dominated by a huge fanged maw that opens to
reveal the central eye. A large number of tentacles protrude from the central
body, each one thick as a human leg and tipped by yet another maw. They are
invariably highly proficient spellcasters in addition to possessing debilitating
gaze attacks and a barrier similar to that of the Vile Eyes. The monster’s
tentacles reach beyond the barrier and thus are always vulnerable, but that also
means it doesn’t need to lower the barrier to attack with them!</p>

<p>Evil Eyes are solitary, and they like to clear out a large, spacious portion of
whatever dungeon or region they emerge in for use as a lair. For all anyone
knows, they just sit there waiting for intruders to kill - stories about Evil
Eye lairs tend to be about mysterious places no one returns from. Very few
people know of the creature’s existence. They are obviously boss monsters.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 35; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 16; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +3; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>DR</strong> 5 (body), 0 (eye, tentacles);</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 5 (Air).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Magic Barrier (-)</strong>: Gives the Evil Eye DR 30 and Magic Resistance 10 while
up.</li>
  <li><strong>Debilitating Gaze (-)</strong>: Works as Dispel Magic cast at skill 20. The target
must also resist with HT-5 or be Stunned for seconds equal to the margin of
failure. Range 30.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (14)</strong>: Damage 4d-2 imp. Reach C.</li>
  <li><strong>Tentacle Bite x8 (16)</strong>: 1d imp, plus the target is automatically grappled
at ST 15. Reach 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Spells (-)</strong>: Any the GM deems appropriate, at skill 20 for Hard spells and
19 for Very Hard ones.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 5; Dark Vision (Color Vision); Doesn’t Breathe; Doesn’t
Eat or Drink; Doesn’t Sleep; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards; Indomitable; Injury
Tolerance (No Brain, No Neck, No Vitals); Magery 5; See Invisible; Unfazeable;
Vibration Sense (Air).</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Elder Thing.</p>

<h3 id="tentacles">Tentacles!</h3>

<p>The Evil Eye’s eight tentacles act as indepentent characters. They have ST and
HP 15, Dodge 10, and attack using the statistics shown on the main Evil Eye stat
block. Once they grapple a target, they’ll attempt to drag them to the Eye’s
maw. Multiple tentacles can cooperate in this!</p>

<p>Damaging a tentacle doesn’t damage the Eye itself. Bringing a tentacle to 0 HP
severs it and takes it out of the fight… but the Eye can spend 5 Concentrate
maneuvers with its barrier down to instantly regenerate all of its tentacles!</p>

<h2 id="the-gazer">The Gazer</h2>

<p>Is this particularly ancient Evil Eye? The progenitor of the whole species?
Something else? No one knows. Its true form cannot exist all at once in our
dimension, but the visible bits are an even larger Evil Eye with an even more
terrible bite. It can use both the Evil Eye’s debilitating gaze and the Vile
Eye’s lethal one at will, as well as cast spells or simply slam victims with its
incredible bulk.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 55; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 16; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Elder Thing.</p>

<h3 id="even-more-tentacles">Even More Tentacles!</h3>

<p>The main spherical body has no tentacles, but the creature can summon up to 16
of them from rifts that open in the walls or floor <em>and move around at Move
4</em>. Severing a tentacle only means it will be automatically replaced by another
in 2 turns.</p>

            <p>Octopus Carnival now has enough material in it that I thought it was time for a
little organization. At the top of the site you should now see a “Projects”
link, which will take to a page linking to all of the big thematic post
collections I’m working on or have finished already. From there, you can go to
individual project pages that discuss its overall goals and link to every
individual post.</p>

<p>As of this post, I have pages for the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">Dragon’s Dogma adaptation</a>, and my
collection of <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics/">GURPS stats for Pathfinder Iconics</a>. If you haven’t followed
either of those from the beginning, now would be an excellent time to get
reacquainted with them.</p>

<p>In the future, I’ll add tag support to the blog to make it even easier to
navigate between posts in a project.</p>

<p>In Gransys, the word “undead” applies to those walking corpses more commonly
known as <em>zombies</em> in other media, but here we use it in the more traditional
Dungeon Fantasy sense to encompass all sorts of horrors from the grave. Undead
make up a large enemy subtype that remains relevant all through the original
game, so any discussion of them necessarily involves spoilers.</p>

<p>Undead in Gransys are generally similar to those found in countless other
fantasy settings. They infest any place that has seen a great deal of death and
not much in the way of ritual purification, or where dark forces are actively at
work. Since many dungeons fall into both categories, they tend to have a lot of
undead.</p>

<p>These creatures tend to be more active at night, and while it’s common to find
large groups of undead they rarely cooperate with other types of monster, which
they view as targets just like any other living creature. In large dungeons,
undead and living monsters tend to have distinct territories and keep to them,
with the occasional fight redefining their borders.</p>

<h2 id="zombies">Zombies</h2>

<p>There’s little to say about the zombies of Gransys that hasn’t been said a
thousand times elsewhere. They’re slow, they moan a lot, they come in large
numbers and they like holding you down and biting you to death. The Horde
Zombies from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 2</strong> and the Servitor Zombie from <strong>DF 9</strong>
should do nicely to represent the bulk of them. Of note is that Gransys zombies
are usually <em>not</em> infectious. They rise because of necromancy, ambient dark
magic, or divine curse, not a plague. Of course, an industrious coven of
necromancers could still get a zombie infestation going by doing all the
animating themselves.</p>

<p>Interesting zombie variations include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Zombie Warrior: Increase ST and give them skill equal to DX with a
weapon. Give them a suit of armor and a weapon covered by the skill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Giant zombie: <em>Double</em> ST, increase SM to +1, and add Resistant to Turning
(+3).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="skeletons">Skeletons</h2>

<p>Common skeletons are little more than faster, more fragile zombies, but they get
interesting rather quickly. Like zombies, they don’t keep any of the original
person’s memories or personality, but they do often retain their skills!
Skeletons that rise from old battlefields tend to be skilled soldiers. Old
temples and mage towers will often contain skeleton <em>wizards</em>. None of them can
improve on these skills after death, but if a 400-point delver falls in the
depths of a death-tainted dungeon, they’re likely to become terrible monsters.</p>

<p>Basic skeletons were commoners in life, and follow the Servitor Skeleton
template from <strong>DF 9</strong> without any weapons or other equipment. For more
dangerous specimens, create a human opponent and apply the Servitor Skeleton
modifiers as a racial template. Using some of the ready-made
opposition <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/07/human-enemies.html">here</a> works, but unique high-point skeletons also exist.</p>

<h2 id="ghosts">Ghosts</h2>

<p>Ghosts are incorporeal undead that resemble spheres of eerie light. They tend to
appear at night over bodies of water, but some may also appear in drier settings
if they died there. In either case, ghosts never stray too far from the site of
their death. Ghosts attack by “entering” a victim and slowly draining their
life. This is erroneously referred to as possession by the inhabitants of
Gransys, but the victim is still in control of their actions while this goes on.</p>

<p>Physical attacks pass harmlessly through these creatures, but spells affect them
normally. Properly fighting them requires a magician with the right spells -
Affect Spirits or “pure energy” attack spells like Fireball or Sunbolt. A group
that lacks any of this is reduced to running and hoping they get far enough away
from the creature’s territory before they succumb to it</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> –; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 6; <strong>HT</strong> 10</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> -1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 8; <strong>DR</strong> 0;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 10; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 10</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 5.5; <strong>Move</strong> 10 (flight with Hover).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Drain Life (12 vs. Will)</strong>: Causes injury equal to the margin of
victory. Cosmic, ignores DR. If the ghost is wounded, it heals the same amount
of HP. The ghost must touch the victim to use this attack.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Flight;  Insubstantial (not vs. Magic);  Immunity to Metabolic
Hazards; Injury Tolerance (No Blood, No Brain, No Neck, No Vitals, Homogenous);
Fragile (Unnatural); No Manipulators; Divine Curse (must stay within 20m of
place of death), Supernatural Features (Glows).</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Undead.</p>

<h2 id="wights-and-liches">Wights and Liches</h2>

<p>The prime example of sapient undead in Gransys, these are powerful spellcasters
who used forbidden magic to turn themselves into immortal undead. They retain
their memories and personality and can keep on improving in their craft after
the transformation. The difference between a wight and a lich is one of degree,
not of kind - a wight is simply a lich who’s still relatively new to the
business.</p>

<p>For both, use the Lich from <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 1</strong> as a starting
point. Wights generally have less of everything that makes a Lich dangerous:
spells, Magery, IQ, resources and minions. Proper liches use the published
stats.</p>

<p>A note on the Unkillable trait: this is a big feature of the published Lich, but
the video game doesn’t seem to ascribe anything like this to its version of them
aside from the tendency all monsters there have of respawning after a while. The
easiest way to translate this would be to split the difference and say Wights
don’t possess the Trait, as they’ve yet to master the trick to it. As variant
mana levels are very rare in Gransys, it could make sense to have liches use the
more traditional philactery instead.</p>

<p>A lich that has a philactery as its weakness still has Unkillable 3: to kill
such a creature, both the philactery and its current body must be destroyed. If
the PCs somehow manage to deal with the philactery first, they must still
contend with the Lich, and do so before it has time to make another philactery
to kill it for good.</p>
