<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<p>In the last post I said it was time to finally end Turn of the Torrent, but that
was a little hasty. The last post covered the big dungeon - this one is the
denouement.</p>

<p>Clearing the Lucky Bones hideout completely and reactivating the magical pump
makes the place usable as the official home base of the Silver Ravens,
increasing the maximum power of the rebellion. Over the course of this adventure
the PCs have also likely gained the support of the Torrent Knights, earned a
number of favors from a powerful Navy captain, and caught a notorious serial
killer.</p>

<p>Those last three goals are supposed to help cement the Silver Ravens’ reputation
as heroic protectors among the people of Kintargo. Catching the Temple Hill
Slasher is obviously a big PR coup, plus I guess the contact networks of the
remaining Torrent Knights and Captain Sargaeta would be pretty dilligent in
spreading the good word about the PCs, making the people like them more even as
Barzilai’s administration likes them less. All of this forces Barzilai to
officially acknowledge the existence of the Silver Ravens, and to be
<em>diplomatic</em> about it.</p>

<p>Thrune hosts an award ceremony at the Kintargo Opera House and issues a very
public invitation to the PCs. During the ceremony he makes a speech praising
their civic-mindedness and hands out valuable gifts.</p>

<p>While The Barzilai has it out of the PCs, he will not try to hurt them here, and
will do his best to appear civil. The gifts are even magic items tailored to be
useful to the PCs! The trick here is that the items are distinctive enough to be
tracked via <em>locate object</em> (D&amp;D) and Seeker (GURPS), which will likely come to
bite the PCs unless they’re very crafty. Really, the best thing they can do with
these “rewards” is ditch them far away from the Lucky Bones, but there’s a good
chance they won’t think about the tracking angle and keep them.</p>

<p>And speaking of crafty, PCs who <em>don’t</em> try to pick a fight during the ceremony
gain a XP reward for being discreet. According to the book, stabbing Thrune in
front of a crow of thousands might be satisfying, but is unlikely to be
productive at this point in time.</p>

<p>The book also says that Barzilai has completed one of the rituals necessary for
becoming a genius loci not long before the public ceremony, and so is looking a
bit haggard and pale. He’ll be back in top form in time for the fight against
the PCs, of course.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, you should give the group access to the full map of the
Lucky Bones basement, secret passages and all, and let them have fun turning it
into a deathtrap dungeon using the resources of the Silver Ravens. The defenses
they install here will be very relevant if/when Thrune discovers its location
and orders his goons to mount an attack.</p>

<h2 id="going-off-the-rails">Going Off the Rails</h2>

<p>The book seems to treat the award ceremony as sort of a closing cutscene in this
adventure, but if you think about it a bit more there are a few things that can
make it go off the rails. Here I’ll discuss these things and how to adapt if
they happen.</p>

<h3 id="thing-1-silver-who">Thing 1: Silver Who?</h3>

<p>It could be that your PCs were so good at covering their tracks that they
performed all the deeds the books consider flashy and public in a very discreet
manner. Maybe they let someone else take the credit for catching the Slasher and
otherwise did their utmost to prevent their Notoriety from rising. On the one
hand, Thrune would know almost nothing about them. On the other, he’d have no
reason to host the ceremony, preventing the “tense encounter”.</p>

<p>I imagine it’s actualy better for the PCs in the long run if it doesn’t happen,
as the Silver Ravens should gather at least <em>some</em> fame and notoriety for their
deeds. The people of Kintargo can’t support you if they don’t know who you are!
Still, if your PCs are this committed to being stealthy ninjas, the ceremony
would either not happen at all, or it would have whoever the PCs pinned their
successes on as the guest of honor. This would also change a few other things
down the line.</p>

<h3 id="thing-2-were-not-going-to-the-fucking-opera-house">Thing 2: We’re Not Going to the Fucking Opera House.</h3>

<p>The PCs could simply not show up to the ceremony! Even here they could do this
in one of several ways, from simply ghosting Barzilai to issuing this section’s
title as a public statement.</p>

<p>However they handle it, this is sure to have a polarizing effect on Kintargo’s
citizens. People who already liked them will love this, people who already liked
Thrune will hate it, and some of those who were on the fence will fall to
whatever side they were closest to. Mechanically, this is an increase both in
the rebellion’s number of supporters and its Notoriety score, modified by the
specific response the PCs chose to give and by their actions in this adventure.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, this <em>shouldn’t</em> have much of an impact in the future
direction of the campaign. The biggest one is that PCs who didn’t attend the
ceremony are sure to not be carrying Barizilai’s trap items when that becomes
relevant.</p>

<h3 id="thing-3-hi-there-prepare-to-die">Thing 3: Hi there! Prepare to Die!</h3>

<p>What if your PCs <em>do</em> stab Barzilai in front of a crow of thousands? The book
tries to discourage this by describing Barzilai’s entourage, which includes a
dozen beefy hellknights, Kintargo’s High Priest of Asmodeus, and two very large
three-headed hellhounds. This might work as a deterrent on Pathfinder, since it
sends the message that “this encounter would be much higher level than your
party”, but it might not be enough to dissuade a party of foolhardy Dungeon
Fantasy delvers from having a go. It would likely still not be an easy battle,
but hey, Barzilai is less than three feet away, he’s weakened from his sinister
ritual, and if he dies anything but a natural death his master plan is foiled!
Fast-Draw, behead, profit!</p>

<p>Should the PCs succeed in killing Barzilai Thrune here, they haven’t exactly
“won” Hell’s Rebels yet. They still have a rebellion to conduct and that just
got a lot harder. Kintargo will be thrown into open conflict much earlier than
the books predict, as Thrune’s cronies will have the perfect excuse to go fully
genocidal on the citizenry and the central Cheliax government will feel
pressured to send an army to respond to this event even though they didn’t like
Barzilai all that much. All of the things that needed to happen for the overall
revolution to be successful now need to happen <em>a lot faster</em>, and likely
without the help of those friendly factions that conditioned their support on
the PCs not being violent hotheads.</p>

<p>In other words, the overall challenge level of the campaign will swiftly rise to
match the level of power and audacity of a party that manages to kill Barzilai
in the ceremony and get away with it. If the players aren’t confident that they
<em>have</em> that level of badassitude, then the PC that goes up to shake Barzilai’s
hand had better not be Impulsive and/or Bloodthirsty.</p>

<p>The first version of D&amp;D I ever player was one of the many Basic boxes, and I
remember carrion crawlers being there. It’s quite likely they’ve been a thing
since the beginning.</p>

<p>Back then I had a hard time seeing why they were dangerous, since their main
attack did no damage and their bite was weak. This is because I didn’t know what
a big deal paralysis was, being a kid and new to the game. If you have fond
memories of those BECMI-or-earlier crawlers, you’ll be happy to know they still
paralyze here.</p>

<p>Carrion Crawlers are present on both the Manual and the Vault. The Monster Vault
has updated versions of both crawlers that show up on the Monster Manual, plus
two new varieties, so you don’t loose anything by going with the Vault versions
only.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual blames a Cocaine Wizard whose name is lost to history for
creating the first crawlers. The Vault elaborates on that story a bit more: this
wizard didn’t <em>create</em> the monsters, she opened a portal to the Far Realm in an
attempt to learn its secrets. A whole lot of bad stuff went through and
destroyed the city she was in. The crawlers came through on the wake of that
main wave drawn by all the corpses.</p>

<p>The Vault also has a bit more to say about their habits of these tentacly
worms. They feed on carrion but don’t like to compete for it with other
scavengers, to they lair in places where food is plentiful but mobility is
limited for the competition: caves, sewers, dungeons, swamps choked with
vegetation, and so on. They’re also drawn to battlefields and cemeteries. A city
dealing with a siege or plague is in even more trouble than usual if it has
crawlers in its sewers.</p>

<p>Carrion crawlers are territorial and will attack any trespassers. It’s also
possible for a crawler to follow a party of adventurers from a distance and,
when they meet other monsters, rush in to help them along the way to becoming
carrion.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Let’s go through the crawlers as presented by the Monster Vault. I’ll note any
differences between these and the MM versions as appropriate. All crawlers
except for the last one are Large Aberrant Beasts and have darkvision.  They
also have a climb speed equal to their land speed with the “spider climb”
special that also allows them to cling to ceilings.</p>

<p>First we have the MV-only <strong>Carrion Crawler Scuttler</strong>, a Level 5 Skirmisher
with 63 HP. It’s the fastest of the lot, with Speed 8. Its basic attack is a
bite that does extra damage to stunned targets. It can also attack with its
tentacle, which target Fortitude, have a bonus to hit prone targets, and do no
damage but stun on a hit (save ends). After stunning the target, the scuttler
can shift its speed and pull them along. As a move action it can perform an
Unsettling Scuttle, shifting its speed and making an attack targetting Fortitude
against anyone whose space it goes through. On a hit, this does no damage but
knocks the target prone.</p>

<p>This is how it fights: scuttle next to someone to knock them down, hit them with
the paralyzing tentacles and scuttle away with the victim to chomp at them in
peace. In the proper terrain, this makes it as dangerous as an horror movie
monster.</p>

<p>The classic <strong>Carrion Crawler</strong> is a level 7 Soldier with 81 HP. Its basic
attack are the tentacles, which target Fortitude, do damage plus ongoing poison
damage and slow. The first failed save worsens this to immobilized, and the
second to stunned. All the while, the target is still taking that poison
damage - this variety’s poison is less paralytic but more toxic. Even on a miss
it still slows for a turn. It also has a bite.</p>

<p>This one exists in both books, and the main difference is that the MV crawler’s
tentacle and bite damage has been fixed - the original’s was extra-low for some
reason. On the other hand, saves against the MM crawler’s tentacles took a -2
penalty.</p>

<p>Next is the <strong>Carrion Crawler Putrefier</strong>, a level 15 soldier with 148 HP. It
emits a Nauseous Stench on a 3 square radius that does ongoing poison damage and
slows anyone who starts their turn in there (save ends both). Its tentacles
target Fort , do necrotic damage and allow the crawler to pull and immobilize
the target. This worsens to stunned <em>and</em> ongoing necrotic damage on the first
failed save. It bites too, but that’s just physical damage.</p>

<p>Finally, we have the <strong>Enormous Carrion Crawler</strong>, which I guess is what you get
when a classic crawler has a few decades to grow. It’s a Level 17 Elite Soldier
with 332 HP. Its tentacles and bite are up-gunned versions of the classic
crawler’s, and it also has threatening reach 3. Additionally, it can attack
with either two tentacles or a tentacle and a bite in its turn, and it can use a
Tentacle Flurry to hit everyone in a Close Blast 3 with its tentacles. The
flurry recharges once the crawler is bloodied, so it can be used twice per
fight.</p>

<p>The MM version is the same, with much lower damage and a -5 penalty on saves
against tentacle effects.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-thoughts">Encounters And Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I guess the MM versions of the crawler are the ones who best capture my BECMI
memories, because they do piddly damage but their paralytic poison is
particularly dangerous. I can see why they changed it, though.</p>

<p>Stunned is right there with dominated as one of the most hated conditions in
4e. It’s the condition that best represent paralysis - you can’t do <em>anything</em>
until you save. This makes the lowly carrion crawler scuttler one of the scarier
monsters in the MV lineup, because it can stun instantly and carry you
away. Fighting it in terrain where it can scuttle out of reach of the PCs while
carrying one of their friends is going to be unnerving.</p>

<p>Since most crawlers are standard monsters, they won’t be found alone. You might
not want to pit the PCs against an equal number of crawlers (or scuttlers!),
though, since that has the potential to stunlock the entire party. On the other
hand, that was a real danger in the BECMI days too.</p>

<p>The proposed encounter in the MV is level 7: two crawlers and three
othyugs. Makes sense, since they could share an habitat and not compete for
food.</p>

<p>I clearly remember Cambions existed in third edition, though I don’t know if
they date from earlier than that. They’re only statted up in the Monster Manual.</p>

<p>Cambions are the offspring of devils and “depraved or unwitting” mortals. This
wording is interesting because it specifically excludes violent rape. The mortal
in question is either aware and willing, or being seduced by a “beautiful
stranger” who later vanishes in the night. It fits the devil idiom in 4e.</p>

<p>It appears Cambions are usually raised by the mother, either in the World or in
the Nine Hells. In either case they’re evil and vicious from childhood, taking
on the worst traits of both parent species. I guess it’s technically possible
for there to be a non-evil cambion, but the ones in the book aren’t them.</p>

<p>Cambions look like red-skinned humans with wings and horns. The book presents us
with two varieties. They’re both Medium Immortal Humanoids (devil). The “devil”
keyword marks them as official devils, and has a few rules attached: devils
breathe and eat, but do not sleep. They are however not immune to sleep effects.</p>

<h2 id="cambion-hellsword">Cambion Hellsword</h2>

<p>This guy is a Level 8 Brute with 106 HP. He has darkvision, resist 10 fire,
speed 6, and a flight speed of 8 (clumsy). The “clumsy” keyword means he takes a
-4 penalty to attacks and defenses while flying, so he only uses the wings to go
from point A to point B. He wears mail and carries a flaming greatsword.</p>

<p>The hellsword’s basic attack is, well, the hell-sword which does physical damage
and ongoing fire damage. When he charges he can make a sword attack against
every enemy in range, and gains 5 temporary HP whenever he bloodies an enemy or
reduces them to 0 HP.</p>

<p>The hellsword fights like a bowling ball, charging groups of enemies and then
focusing on whoever is closer to being bloodied or taken out.</p>

<h2 id="cambion-hellfire-magus">Cambion Hellfire Magus</h2>

<p>This gal is Level 18 Artillery, and is all about setting things on fire. She
possesses the same darkvision and speed as the hellsword, but her fire
resistance is 15.</p>

<p>Her basic melee attack is with a quarterstaff, and as usual for artillery
monsters it’s useless. Her main at-will attack is the Hellfire Ray, which
targets Reflex, does fire damage, and knocks prone on hit. She can also use
Soulscorch, an area attack that also targets reflex, and does both immediate and
ongoing fire damage. That one recharges on a 5-6.</p>

<p>The hellfire magus also has a passive Soul Mantle power, which gives her +4 to
AC and Reflex against ranged attacks.</p>

<p>Her tactics are simple: keep away and shoot fire. Her traits make it both
desirable and difficult for PCs to close to melee with her.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>Predictably, Cambions can be found hanging out with devils or with the sort of
evil being who likes to hang out with devils. The suggested encounters are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8, four hellswords and a succubus. One happy family?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18, 2 hellfire magi, a rakshasa noble, and 2 rockfire dreadnought
elementals. A rajah and his advisors plus some summoned muscle.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Back in the 3e days it took me the longest time to figure out what made cambions
different from tieflings. Both are descended from devils, right? Apparently the
difference was that cambions were direct offspring, while tieflings were who
knows how many generations removed from their fiendish ancestor. In 4e, of
course, tieflings are humans mutated by a diabolic pact their distant ancestors
made.</p>

<p>If you want to make a custom cambion, their “signature” traits are the devil
keyword, the fire resistance, and the wings with their clumsy flight
speed. Their attack powers seem to show a strong tendency towards fire, but
there’s no specific fire power all cambions have.</p>

<p>Story-wise, I’d say people don’t really summon cambions despite them having the
devil keyword. Rather, cambions arrive at a place by themselves and tempt other
people into diabolism.</p>

<p>Bullettes, or Land Sharks, have been a part of D&amp;D since the very beginning. As
legend has it, Gary Gygax got the inspiration for them from a cheap plastic
“dinosaur” toy he had lying around. They look like a cross between a rhino and a
mole with, yes, a bullet-shaped head. Their bodies are covered in tough plates.</p>

<p>They’re on both the Monster Manual and Monster Vault: the MM has a normal
Bullete and a Dire Bullette. The Vault updates these two and adds a Young
Bullette. If you have the Monster Vault you can safely use only its versions of
the monster without missing anything. The lore below is combined from both
books, with the Vault containing the most detail.</p>

<p>In 4e, land sharks are naturally occurring predators. They’re both always hungry
and dumb as a bag of hammers. The creatures will arrive at a region, eat
everything that moves, and move on in search of more food. When this happens
near a human settlement, the usual response from the humans is to pull up stakes
and move away.</p>

<p>Bullettes hunt by detecting prey with their tremorsense and bursting out the
ground with great force underneath the chosen victims. They’ll try to eat
anything smaller than themselves, and to fight anything larger out of sheer
orneriness. These beasts are solitary, but might “accidentally” become part of
an encounter with other monsters by bursting out of the ground mid-fight and
trying to eat everyone.</p>

<p>All bullettes here have darkvision, tremorsense 20, a ground speed of 6 and a
burrow speed of 6. When they burrow or emerge from the ground, the squares where
the transision happened become difficult terrain. The longer a fight against a
bullette goes on, the more messed up the surrounding terrain becomes.</p>

<h2 id="young-bullette">Young Bullette</h2>

<p>The young bullette still hasn’t fully developed the boundless stamina of an
adult specimen. It’s a Medium Natural Beast and a Level 7 Lurker with 68 HP.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a somewhat weak bite, which becomes a lot more damaging
when used as part of the Snapping Jaws power. To use it, the monster must be
underground. It burrows up to its speed and emerges adjacent to an opponent,
making a much more damaging bite attack as it does so. This doesn’t provoke
opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>The youngling can them disengage with Submerge in Earth, an at-will standard
action which allows it to shift one square, burrow up to its speed, and recharge
Snapping Jaws.</p>

<p>This strong-bite/disengage/strong-bite pattern is what makes the Young Bullette
a lurker. It’s not trying to hide from you, it just needs a little run-up to
properly tear your head off.</p>

<h2 id="bullette">Bullette</h2>

<p>The classic model, a fully developed specimen. It’s a Large Natural Beast, and a
Level 9 Elite Skirmisher with 200 HP.</p>

<p>The adult Bullette’s basic bite is a lot stronger than that of the youngling,
and does extra damage to prone targets. It can optionally jump up to 5 squares
before using it, without provoking opportunity attacks. Climbing a tree will not
save you!</p>

<p>If it’s underground, it can use Rising Burst, burrowing up to its speed without
provoking opportunity attacks and attacking on a Close Burst 2 when it
emerges. This is a little less damaging than the single-target bite but still
does half damage on a miss.</p>

<p>All of the three attacks above are at-will standard actions!</p>

<p>As a move action, it can use Earth Furrow, which allows it to burrow its speed
at a depth of 1 square (again without provoking OAs). If it passes beneath an
enemy space, it makes an attack against the enemy’s Fortitude, which does no
damage but knocks the enemy prone on a hit.</p>

<p>All of these abilities can come together to make an impressive alpha strike:
Earth Furrow to enter the fight while knocking people around, and then a Rising
Burst followed by an Action Point-fueled Leaping Bite. “A bullette bursts from
the ground and catches 25 feet of air with the wizard in its mouth!”</p>

<p>The Monster Manual version is pretty much the same, but buggier. Slightly lower
damage, oddly lower accuracy, and it forces you to reference the rules for
standing long jumps to figure out how far it leaps. MM bullettes can also use a
Second Wind once per encounter, which recovers 51 HP and gives them a temporary
defense boost.</p>

<p>Second Wind on monsters is an early mechanic that quickly fell out of favor with
players and designers. It’s pretty much just a more convoluted form of giving
monsters an extra 25% HP, and generally only serves to make fights last longer.</p>

<h2 id="dire-bullette">Dire Bullette</h2>

<p>Every natural predator has a dire version. The bullette is a natural
predator. Therefore, it has a dire version. This nightmare is a Huge Natural
Beast, a Level 18 Elite Skirmisher with 350 HP. Its ground and burrow speed are
8.</p>

<p>It fights exactly like the “common” bullette, with increased damage appropriate
to its level. Its leaping bite allows it to leap 7 squares instead of just 5,
and the Rising Burst has a radius of 3 instead of 2.</p>

<p>Being Huge, it’s likely to make the whole battlemap into difficult terrain
before the PCs manage to slay it.</p>

<p>The MM version even has similar differences! As with the common bullette, you
don’t lose anything by using the MV version at all times.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-thoughts">Encounters And Thoughts</h2>

<p>The suggested encounter in the MM is level 9, a bullette intruding on a fight
with a group of 3 trolls.</p>

<p>A bullette is kind of a one-note monster. However, it plays that note very well
indeed. I like it!</p>

<p>Here’s another monster I never heard of, though I’m almost sure they come from a
previous edition. They’re on the Monster Manual only.</p>

<p>Like Bodaks, Boneclaws are constructed undead that don’t occur naturally. Lots
of necromantically inclined villains (liches, Orcus priests and the like) use
them as guards and assassins. Creating one involves building a body from corpse
parts and binding an evil soul into it through magic. The result is a Large
Shadow Animate (undead), with variable-length talons that can reach 10 feet in
length at maximum extension.</p>

<p>The ritual for creating a boneclaw is one of those “secrets” that keeps being
stolen and traded away all the time. Some people say it was first developed by
Vecna himself, though the true authors are a coven of hags led by the night hag
Grigwartha. Her version of it used the corpse of an ogre and the soul of an oni,
but others have adapted it for different “raw materials”. Grigwartha frequently
traded the ritual for favors from other necromancers, so if you want your
current villain to have access to boneclaws you don’t need any special
explanation for it.</p>

<p>This entry has only a single variety, appropriately named <strong>Boneclaw</strong>. It’s a
Level 14 Soldier with 136 HP and the usual undead traits of immunity to disease
and poison plus Resist 20 necrotic and Vulnerable 5 Radiant. It’s far from
mindless, with Int 10 and an Evil disposition. It speaks Common, and runs at you
with Speed 8.</p>

<p>The boneclaw attacks with its claws (duh), which have Reach 3 and Threatening
Reach. If a boneclaw hits someone with an opportunity attack, it can make
another opportunity attack against the same target in the same turn. A nasty
surprise to people who think they’re safe after the first one.</p>

<p>When bloodied, it lets out a Necrotic Pulse in a Close Burst 10, healing undead
allies by 10 points and damaging living enemies by the same amount.</p>

<p>A relatively simple yet flavorful monster, whose flavor is further enhanced by
whomever you partner it with. The sample encounter is level 14, a lich and its
complement of bodyguards: two boneclaws and a shield guardian.</p>

<p>If you want to build a custom boneclaw, an assassin version that’s a Lurker or
Skirmisher instead of a Soldier might be appropriate. Other than the undead
resistances, the signature trait here seems to be the long Reach on the claws
and doing something necrotic when it’s bloodied.</p>
