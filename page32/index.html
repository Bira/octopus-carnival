<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Howlers totally feel like a 3e monster, probably because of the art. I suppose
they might have shown up in AD&amp;D too, it’s not like the game was ever shy about
adding one more dog monster to the pile.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Howlers are spiky, sapient quadrupedal predators that feed on fear. They’ve
evolved to hunt in a way that’s as terrifying as possible. Younger howlers are
quick to kill because they enjoy the spike of fear the victim feels when it
dies, but older specimens are sophisticated enough to hold whole villages
hostage with the <em>threat</em> of death-by-howler and feed off the ambient terror.</p>

<p>The most legendary howler of all is known as Terror Incarnate. This creature
managed to devour the fear felt by an entire army as it died, and this excess
power turned it into something like a demigod of terror. Its eventual progeny
inherited its powers.</p>

<p>There’s some fuzzy edges in their lore. It mentions howlers attacking people in
the middle world and in the Underdark, mentions associations with shadar-kai,
but gives the creature an Elemental origin. I think they might fit better as
either Natural or Shadow. Fortunately origin doesn’t influence
stats. Alternatively you might go the other way and make them a type of demon.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, Howlers are Elemental Magical Beasts. They have Darkvision
and a Speed of 8. They understand Abyssal but can’t speak.</p>

<h3 id="howler-dread-hound">Howler Dread Hound</h3>

<p>One of those young specimens that kills too quickly. They gather in huge packs
to massacre whole villages at once. They are Medium Level 9 Minion Controllers
with a speed of 8. At Int 5, they’re sapient but dim.</p>

<p>As with all “dog monsters”, their basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong>. This one does a
bit of damage and slides the target 1 square on a hit. They also have a
<strong>Piercing Spines</strong> trait that deals the same damage as the bite to anyone who
misses them with a melee attack. The ability that gives them their name is the
<strong>Dread Howl</strong> encounter power, a fear attack that catches every enemy in a
Close Blast 5 and targets Will. A hit does a bit of psychic damage and makes the
target grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>These are minions, so there will always be a lot of them when they appear. A bit
of orchestration could ensure PCs grant combat advantage for most of the fight.</p>

<h3 id="howler-doom-mastiff">Howler Doom Mastiff</h3>

<p>An older, fully developed howler who has learned the value of prolonged
psychological torture. They roam ruins and tunnels in small packs, looking for
victims to terrify. They are Large Level 13 Skirmishers with 129 HP and a speed
of 8.</p>

<p>Doom Mastiffs are large enough to ride, and they have the Mount keyword. As they
have Int 9, I think this is more of an equal partnership thing than the rider
“keeping” the howler as a mount or pet. The <strong>Guarding Spines</strong> trait gives the
mastiff’s rider a +2 bonus to AC. Its <strong>Piercing Spines</strong> does 10 damage to
anyone who misses the howler <em>or its rider</em> with a melee attack.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>Bites</strong> are a little weak but can be used as part of a <strong>Loping
Bite</strong> attack that allows the mastiff to shift half its speed and bite. Their
<strong>Terrifying Howl</strong> is a lot stronger than the dread hound’s: it deals 10
ongoing psychic damage to those it hits, and makes them grant combat advantage
(save ends). Targets adjacent to the mastiff <em>can’t save agains this</em>. Finally,
this is a (recharge 6+) power instead of an encounter power. So it might happen
more than once!</p>

<p>Being all about that delicious fear, the mastiff will open with a howl and then
will do its best to stick to one of the affected PCs, using move actions and
Loping Bites to do so. It’s smart enough to prefer a squishy victim over a
defender, too.</p>

<h3 id="howler-terror-incarnate">Howler Terror Incarnate</h3>

<p>The one that devoured an army’s collective fear and became a demigod of
terror. It’s a Large Level 22 Lurker with 155 HP.</p>

<p>The terror’s <strong>Shadow Spines</strong> work a lot like that of its lesser relatives, but
deal necrotic damage. It also has a <strong>Terror Incarnate</strong> aura (3) that deals 10
psychic damage per turn to any enemies inside.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>bite</strong> deals the same damage as that of the level 13 doom mastiff,
which I’m almost sure is a typo. It can also possess people with the <strong>Shadow of
Terror</strong> power. This is a melee attack that can only be used against people who
can’t see the howler, and who haven’t been possessed during the fight yet. On a
hit, the howler is removed from play and the target is dominated (save
ends). The target’s at-will attacks deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage and target
Will instead of their original defenses. The posession ends when the target
passes a save or takes radiant damage - when this happens, the howler reappears
adjacen to them. The target is then dazed (save ends).</p>

<p>Their final attack is the <strong>Death Howl</strong>, another blast attack. This one does
immediate psychic damage and dazes (save ends) on a hit.</p>

<p><strong>Shadow Lope</strong> (recharge 4+) provides the ability to set up for a Shadow of
Terror attack: it allows the howler to become invisible for a turn and move its
speed.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>Howlers are far from the first dog monsters to show up in D&amp;D. They’re not even
the first dog monsters with fear powers. Still, you can use them in your
campaign in place of wargs and other similarly-leveled canine menaces for added
variety. The Doom Mastiff’s ability to act as a mount also makes it an possible
replacement for a Nightmare. Anyone who would ride an Evil Fire Horse would also
certainly ride an Evil Fear Dog.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This is kind of an addendum to my earlier post on <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/08/03/merging-weapon-skills.html">Merging Weapon Skills in
GURPS</a>, which occurred to me after reading this other post in <a href="https://aftertheogre.blogspot.com/2022/08/df-novices-merging-weapon-skills.html">After the
Ogre</a>. I realized I hadn’t mentioned Shield skills, but I had been merging
them for so long I had forgotten that wasn’t the standard.</p>

<p>In my GURPS games, there is only one shield skill:</p>

<h3 id="shield-dxe">Shield (DX/E)</h3>

<p>This skill merges <strong>Shield</strong>, <strong>Shield (Buckler)</strong> and <strong>Force
Shield</strong>. There is still a mechanical difference between a shield that’s held in
the hand and one that’s strapped to the arm, but both of them use the same
skill and there is no familiarity penalty from switching between them.</p>

<p>If you’re using the optional rules for Familiarity Penalties in the previous
post, such a penalty would definitely apply when someone used to traditional
shields wields a weightless force shield, and vice-versa. As a reminder, that’s
a -2 penalty to Shield that goes away after a few hours of practice during
downtime, at no point cost.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>As I mentioned way back in the MM/MV post about <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/05/16/hag.html">Hags</a>, they’re a species of
fey that resemble fairytale witches in appearance and behavior. They tend to
have great knowledge of magic, but also tend use it to further selfish and
greedy schemes.</p>

<p>Their basic lore remains the same in the MM3, which also adds that hags are
keepers of secrets. They’re always after new treasure and new secrets, generally
of the type that increases their power. They use divination magic, pacts with
mortals, and a network of portals that weaves through the Feywild and the middle
world, which they also use to keep connected to each other.</p>

<p>Hags are of course loathe to part with any of their secrets for
free. Adventurers seeking information from a hag must usually agree to do them a
favor, which commonly means doing something nasty to one of the hag’s many
enemies. These enemies might include archfey, demons, devils, other hags…</p>

<p>Hags are Medium Fey Humanoids and have Low-Light Vision. Everything else varies
with stat blocks, which are usually split along the lines of which type of magic
a hag uses in combat. I don’t think they’re supposed to be different sub-species
or anything of the sort.</p>

<h2 id="pact-hag">Pact Hag</h2>

<p>This is your typical “sinister village witch”, living in a hut out of sight of
the village itself. This location is far enough away to deter curious casuals,
but still close enough that someone who really wants to make a deal with the hag
can easily reach it.</p>

<p>A pact hag is much more willing to negotiate with these visitors than most of
her relatives, though she’s still just as prone to seeking deals that benefit
her more than they do the petitioner. She usually keep ogres, trolls, and
dangerous fey fauna as bodyguards. They’re initially out of sight, but can
arrive quickly if a fight breaks out.</p>

<p>Pact hags are Level 11 Controllers with the Leader tag and 115 HP. In a fight,
they use all sorts of fun mind control magic, starting with a <strong>Pact of
Obedience</strong> aura (5) that allows allies inside to spend 5 HP to reroll a missed
attack roll with a +2 bonus to the reroll.</p>

<p>Her basic melee attack is a <strong>Compelling Staff</strong> that deals light damage but
forces the target to make a melee basic attack against a target of the hag’s
choice.</p>

<p>Her basic ranged attack is named <strong>Pact of Compelled Obedience</strong> and does no
damage at all, but it dominates the target for a turn instead. Fun (TM) for the
whole party.</p>

<p>Her special attacks follow along the same lines. <strong>Pact of Choked Aggression</strong>
also doesn’t do immediate damage and inflicts a nasty curse on the target:
they take 10 psychic damage the first time they hit a creature during one of
their turns. This lasts until the end of the encounter, or until one of the
target’s allies attacks the target. And it recharges when no enemy is affected
by the curse!</p>

<p>The other special attack is <strong>Pact of Shared Agony</strong>, which the hag can only
use while bloodied. It’s another curse: until the end of the encounter, if the
target is within 10 squares of the hag, they take 10 psychic damage whenever the
hag takes any amount of damage. This power recharges whenever the hag misses
with it, so she can keep using it until she hits.</p>

<p>This big emphasis on indirect damage means pact hags work best when surrounded
by those beefy bodyguards, and will probably try to flee the fight once they
become bloodied. Pact of Shared Agony is good for discouraging pursuit by melee
strikers. Their “Pact” theme makes them a good patron for a heroic-tier fey
warlock! This patron hag might either level up as the PC does, or you can have a
story where the PC “trades up” to a better teacher Sith-style once the hag’s
demands become untenable.</p>

<h2 id="dream-hag">Dream Hag</h2>

<p>These hags, as you might imagine, focus on dream magic. They can send dream
visions to people, a power they use to lure their (or their paying customer’s)
enemies to traps. However, the constraints of dream magic mean the hag doesn’t
have full control over the content of the visions, so genuinely useful
information tends to slip through.</p>

<p>Dream Hags are Level 19 Controllers with 179 HP. They project a <strong>Nightmare
Weaver</strong> aura (3) that causes unconscious enemies inside to become dominated for
a turn. They stand up and perform one action of the hag’s choice while still
remaining unconscious. The wording here makes it clear that this puppetry
continues while the enemies remain inside the aura.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Staff of Mindless Reverie</strong>, which damages and dazes
for a turn on a hit. Their at-will ranged attack are weaponized <strong>Nightmare
Visions</strong> that deal psychic damage and slide the target 5 squares.</p>

<p>And then we have the powers that make people unconscious so the hag can exploit
her aura. Both affect a Close Blast 5! <strong>Dust of Dreams</strong> (recharge 5+) dazes on
a hit (save ends), and this worsens to unconsciousness after the first failed
save. <strong>Sleep’s Undeniable Grasp</strong> (Encounter) makes its targets unconscious
right away. It’s a (save ends) effect and it also ends if the target is
attacked.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s possible for the hag to put the whole party to sleep at once if she’s
really lucky. This <em>shouldn’t</em> be an automatic total party kill if you run the
abilities as written, though - sleeping PCs can still roll saves to end the
effect, and in the case of the encounter power they also wake up if attacked. Of
course, this attack will probably be an auto-crit if it comes from an enemy, so
it’s still a problem.</p>

<p>I also think it’s acceptable to fudge things a little if Team Monster’s goal is
something other than killing the PCs. If the goal is capturing them, or taking
them somewhere else, then you can fade to black if the whole party falls asleep
and have them wake up at that place.</p>

<h2 id="mist-hag">Mist Hag</h2>

<p>These are among the most powerful of hags. They’ve been accumulating secrets,
artifacts and power for ages, and they dwell in the deepest forests of the
Feywild. Their dwellings are surrounded by a thick mist that they have full
control over. If the Death Hag from the MM1 was a “Baba Yaga wannabe”, this one
is closest to the real deal. She’s pretty much an arch-fey herself. The Mist Hag
does not deal with devils - devils deal with <em>her</em>. A few of them probably have
been pressed into service as her bodyguards. Other possible allies include epic
undead, fomorians, and so on.</p>

<p>A Mist Hag is a Level 27 Controller with the Leader tag and 247 HP. She has a
zippy ground speed of 8, instead of the standard 6 for a medium humanoid. Her
aura is a <strong>Mist Shroud</strong> that makes allies within 1 square insubstantial.</p>

<p>The hag’s <strong>Mist Staff</strong> damages and pushes targets 5 squares. During the push,
targets act as if they had the Phasing trait, which means the hag can push them
through walls and other creatures. The final destination square must still be
empty, but the hag doesn’t need to have a line of effect to it or the other
squares of the push. If you want to get cute with this ability, include a piece
of hazardous terrain surrounded by walls in your battle map.</p>

<p>Her basic attack is <strong>Mist on the Wind</strong>, which damages and removes the
target from play for a turn! The target returns to play in a square of the hag’s
choice within 4 squares of its original position.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Choking Mist</strong> (recharge 5+) is a ranged attack serves as a reminder
that the PCs are breathing the same mist the hag can control. It deals heavy
physical damage and ongoing 20 damage (save ends). Every time the target fails a
save, the hag can slide them 3 squares.</p>

<p>When an enemy gets to within 2 squares of the hag, the hag can use <strong>Maze of
Mist</strong> to mess with them. This is a triggered effect that doesn’t require an
action, so it can happen every time the trigger happens. When it does, the hag
can roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, she slides the triggering enemy 1
square. This makes closing to melee reach a lot harder than usual.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>As I said back in the original article, I like hags when they are portrayed as
their own species of fey being that don’t necessarily need to obey natural
laws. They’re fairytale witches, with a penchant for doing the things fairytale
witches do.</p>

<p>That said, I think treating each hag stat block as an entirely different species
is going a bit too far. I prefer to treat those as differences of skill and
training.</p>

<p>Just look at this pointy boy. They’re not even trying to hide the inspiration
for him.</p>

<p>Anyway, D&amp;D has had monsters named “gremlin” since almost its beginning, but the
lore for them its new to this edition.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A long time ago, the fomorians under King Thrumbolg took a large group of goblin
captives, transformed them into bioweapons, and released them into the cities of
their eladrin enemies. The new creatures had a great aptitude for deception and
sabotage, and an engineered predilection for it. These were the first gremlins.</p>

<p>They did their job wonderfully, disrupting the alliance of eladrin city states
arrayed against Thrumbolg by altering the correspondence between them, murdering
key officials, and other such deeds. However, they also ended up doing the same
sort of thing to Thumbolg’s own court, causing great damage to it. Gremlins
gotta gremlin.</p>

<p>The little rascals were cast out, and over the ages spread through the Feywild
and the middle world. Though they sometimes live openly in the communities of
other sapients, many gremlins follow their engineered calling and hide out among
their chosen victims, taming vermin to do their bidding and engaging in the same
ghastly shenanigans their ancestors did back in the day, basically for the
lulz. The worst among them find natural allies in demons, who have the same
appetite for chaos.</p>

<p>Examples of things gremlins do, taken from the stat block descriptions: stealing
documents and heirlooms from a royal court and stashing them to be found in the
quarters of visiting nobles; intercepting and altering important correspondence
so that a call for peace becomes a declaration of war; and plain old serial
murder.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gremlins are Small Fey Humanoids with low-light vision and a speed of 6. They
have two signature abilities present in almost all stat blocks. The first is
<strong>Sabotaging Presence</strong>, an large aura (size 5) that gives enemies inside a -5
penalty to skill checks. The second is <strong>Gremlin Tactics</strong>, a reaction that
allows them to swap spaces with an enemy that misses them with a melee attack.</p>

<p>Skill-wise, training in Stealth and Thievery is nearly universal, and they
occasionally know other “thiefy” skills like Bluff as well.</p>

<h3 id="gremlin-deceiver">Gremlin Deceiver</h3>

<p>Deceivers are Level 5 Controllers with 63 HP, which makes them the earliest
gremlin the PCs are likely to find. Like other gremlins, their presence is going
to be hidden at first, and they only fight when found out.</p>

<p>Deceivers fight with their <strong>claws</strong>, but their magic is a lot more
interesting. They can cast a fireball-sized <strong>Befuddling Burst</strong> that targets
Will and, on a hit, deals psychic damage and prevents targets from shifting or
standing up (save ends). The burst itself doesn’t knock them prone - that’s what
the <strong>Slip Up</strong> minor-action attack does. This is a ranged attack that targets
Will and does no damage.</p>

<p>For added lulz, pair them with other monsters that can knock people prone, such
as other gremlins, or wolves reskinned as dire rats.</p>

<h3 id="gremlin-skulker">Gremlin Skulker</h3>

<p>Skulkers are Level 7 Lurkers with 64 HP, and they’re surprisingly sticky. Aside
from the standard gremlin traits, they have a <strong>Shadow Sneak</strong> passive that
makes them invisible while adjacent to an enemy, and <strong>Opportunistic Advantage</strong>
that gives them extra damage in opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>Their <strong>claw</strong> attacks do okay damage and “curse” the target: if the target
moves away from the gremlin, they fall prone at the end of their movement. And
when an enemy adjacent to the skulker moves, the <strong>Shadow Skulk</strong> encounter
power allows them to shift up to 6 squares <em>simultaneously</em>, following the enemy
as it moves so it stays adjacent.</p>

<p>You want this one right in the middle of the PCs, preferrably starting the fight
already there with some of those strong opportunity attcks after sneaking in
undetected.</p>

<h3 id="gremlin-conniver">Gremlin Conniver</h3>

<p>Connivers are Level 17 Controllers with 162 HP. That’s quite a jump in power!
They’re probably similar to the OG gremlins that destroyed the eladrin alliance.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>claw</strong> attack also teleports the target 5 squares on a hit. Their
<strong>Connive</strong> spell is a non-damaging, at-will ranged attack that dominates on a
hit (<em>save ends</em>!). Fortunately only one creature can be dominated at a time.</p>

<p>As a minor action it can also create a <strong>Beguiling Fog</strong> (recharge 6+), a
fireball-sized area attack against Will that does no damage. It always dazes the
enemy - a hit means it’s a (save ends) effect, a miss means it only lasts a
turn.</p>

<p>While connivers have little direct damage potential, they can dole out some of
the game’s most annoying status effects at-will. The teleport effect on their
basic claw attack is also particularly wonderful in battlefields with dangerous
terrain or other hazards.</p>

<h3 id="gremlin-prankster">Gremlin Prankster</h3>

<p>Pranksters are Level 17 Minion Controllers, perfect for when you want to
re-enact a certain 80s movie. They’re not particularly hardy, but they like to
run around in huge crowds and try to cause as much chaos as possible before
vanishing. They have a basic <strong>claw</strong> attack and a <strong>Slip Up</strong> ranged attack
that’s similar to the Deceiver’s, but also slides the target 3 squares before
knocking them prone.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The teme for the Gremlins 2 movie was playing through my head the entire time I
was writing this. I love these critters.</p>

<p>They’re also very interesting mechanically and can end up making your PCs pull
their own hair out in frustration. That can lead to memorable sessions if you do
it properly, but can also be frustrating for the <em>players</em>, so consider the
examples below cautiously.</p>

<p>If you really want the PCs to have a bad time, make sure your gremlin encounter
takes place in a site full of traps and other hazards that require skill checks
to disable. Or even have the PCs deal with a gremlin battle and a skill
challenge at the same time. The skill penalty from Sabotaging Presence is
<em>untyped</em>, meaning it technically stacks, but if you’re feeling merciful you can
say it caps out at the -5 a single gremlin would provide.</p>

<p>That skill penalty also aids grappling-centered monsters! The roll to escape a
grapple is a skill check, after all.</p>

<p>Since a lot of gremlins can knock PCs prone, they also go really well with
monsters that can do ugly things to prone PCs. Especially evil GMs might want to
keep in mind that 2 Gremlin Deceivers and 2 Needlefang Drake Swarms make up a
valid Level 3 encounter.</p>

<p>Oh boy, more gnolls. They’ve been in every Monster Manual for this edition. I
skipped the MM2 entry because it turned out to fully overlap the Monster Vault,
but the one in this book is specifically meant to complement the MV instead of
overlapping with it. We don’t get much in the way of new lore, but we get a few
new stat blocks.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>As usual, gnolls are Medium Natural Humanoids. They have low-light vision and
their ground speed is 7. Their signature ability remains <strong>Pack Attack</strong>,
giving them a +5 damage bonus on melee and ranged attacks against an enemy that
has two or more gnoll allies adjacent to it.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-skulker">Gnoll Skulker</h3>

<p>Our first gnoll, however, is a bit of an exception. These runty buggers are too
cowardly to employ the usual brutish gnoll tactics, so they usually keep to the
edges of the fight and wait for opportunities to strike isolated enemies from
surprise. They’re good at this, but it’s not a fighting style that’s valued in
“mainstream” demon-worshipping gnoll society.</p>

<p>Skulkers are Level 5 Lurkers with 51 HP. Their <strong>Peerless Camouflage</strong> allows
them to make Stealth checks to hide even when they only have partial cover or
concealment, and to stay hidden for an additional turn after leaving
cover. They lack Pack Attack but have <strong>Something to Prove</strong>, gaining a +5
damage bonus against enemies that have <em>no</em> allies adjacent to them.</p>

<p>They fight with a <strong>dagger</strong> and a <strong>shortbow</strong>, and have a <strong>Hit and Run</strong>
maneuver that allows them to shift 2 squares after hitting with the bow if they
attack from hiding.</p>

<p>A band of gnolls with some skulkers in it is a lot harder to fight. If you
spread out a bit to make it harder for the standard gnolls to use Pack Attack,
the skulkers get you with Something to Prove, and vice-versa.</p>

<h3 id="gnoll-war-fang">Gnoll War Fang</h3>

<p>War Fangs are heavily armored commander-types that also make use of demonic
powers. They’re anti-paladins of Yeenoghu, basically. War Fangs are Level 6
Soldiers with 72 HP and the Leader tag.</p>

<p>Their <strong>War Fang Defense</strong> aura (1) grants allies a +2 bonus to AC, and they
fight with a Longsword that deals extra damage when they’re bloodied (this
stacks with Pack Attack).</p>

<p>Once per round as a minor action, they can issue a <strong>Demonic Challenge</strong> that
works a lot like the paladin version - it marks an enemy within 3 squares, and
whenever the marked enemy makes an attack that doesn’t target the war fang they
suffer 10 fire damage.</p>

<p>If any enemy misses the war fang with a melee attack, the <strong>No Mercy</strong> ability
allows an ally adjacent to that enemy to make a melee basic attack against them.</p>

<p>War Fangs work very well when positioned in the second row of the enemy front
line, because they’ll improve the front-liners’ defenses and mark the PCs from a
place where they can’t be easily attacked. They also do very well on the front
line when surrounded by their allies.</p>

<h3 id="chosen-of-yeenoghu">Chosen of Yeenoghu</h3>

<p>This is a gnoll necromancer, a Level 7 Elite Controller with 156 HP. It fights
with a <strong>staff</strong> in melee and fires <strong>bolts of ruination</strong> that deal necrotic
damage at range, but its main schtick is filling the battlefield with ghostly
hyenas.</p>

<p>The Chosen can summon a single <strong>Hyena Spirit</strong> as a minor action, or four of
them at once with the <strong>Call Beyond the Grave</strong> encounter power. <strong>Spirit
Strike</strong> is a 1/round minor action that allows a spirit to make a free basic
attack with a +2 bonus. Finally, <strong>To the Front</strong> is a power that teleports
every adjacent ally 10 squares.</p>

<p>This is a monster, not a PC, so it doesn’t use PC summoning rules. Hyena Spirits
are Level 7 Minion Soldiers and each one has their own full set of actions in
the initiative order. They have a <strong>Spectral Jaws</strong> aura (1) that slows enemies
caught inside, and a standard basic bite attack. When one of them dies, the
Chosen takes 5 damage. Depending on how the Chosen is positioned, killing the
hyenas might be the only way the PCs can damage it.</p>

<p>The spirits are worth 0 XP if they’re summoned by a Chosen, but you can include
them in a fight by themselves and have them work as normal minions.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I continue to mourn the fact that they never expanded playable non-evil gnolls
beyond that single Dragon article, while remarking that the mechanics for these
gnolls are pretty interesting.</p>
