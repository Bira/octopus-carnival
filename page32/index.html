<p>Stirges have been in the game at least since the days of Basic. Here, they are
both in the Monster Manual and in the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Stirges are another example of dangerous fantasy wildlife in the implied Fourth
Edition setting. Looking like a cross between a large bat and a mosquito, these
things feed on blood and will attack any nearby creature in search of it when
hungry. While a mosquito can be dangerous because it transmits diseases, a
stirge is large enough for the blood loss it causes to be worrying. A flock of
them could exsanguinate an adult human in minutes.</p>

<p>Like bats, they nest in dark places and tend to hunt at night. They’re a common
enough threat that anti-stirge measures are a part of every culture. Ship crews,
for example, spread unpleasant-smelling unguents in their cargo holds to prevent
stirges from nesting there. Sheperds and ranchers absolutely hate them and have
their own set of measures.</p>

<p>Any dark dungeon might be home to a flock of stirges, making them one of the
many dangers adventurers must always be wary of. A large enough flock can
threaten even seasoned veterans!</p>

<p>Since they’re considered vermin by the people of the world, they also have all
the same sinister associations worms and rats and such get. Particularly gross
necromancers love filling the body cavities of a large, bloated zombie with a
flock of stirges, which burst out when their carrier is slain. Optionally the
stirges might be zombies as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Stirges are Small Natural Beasts, which does mean they might get as big as three
feet across (halfling-sized!). They have darkvision, a flight speed of 6 with
Hover, and a pathetic ground speed of 2. Their main attack is always a “bite”
with their blood-sucking proboscis-beak thing, but the exact mechanics of that
vary per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="stirge-both">Stirge (Both)</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 1 Lurker with 22 HP and the common traits above. The
<strong>bite</strong> is its only attack. It does damage and grabs the target (escape DC
12). While the target is grabbed, it takes 5 ongoing damage from the
blood-sucking. While the stirge is grabeed, it gains +5 to AC and Reflex.</p>

<p>The MM version has an extremely weak bite even for a level 1 monster (1d4
damage), but the MV updates that to be in line with the new math (1d4+5).</p>

<p>While a single stirge is not a big threat to a full party, it’s terrifying to a
civilian!  Non-combatants are likely minions, and if not they’re unlikely to
have much more than 10 or 15 HP. A stirge like the above could be nesting in any
given dark hole near the poor schmuck’s farm, and could kill them in one bite
and <em>maybe</em> a round or two of blood-sucking. The civilian is also more likely to
meet the stirge than a goblin or the like, and of course it will never be just
one stirge.</p>

<h3 id="stirge-suckerling-mv">Stirge Suckerling (MV)</h3>

<p>A young stirge that’s already quite hungry. It’s a Level 5 Minion Lurker, which
means it comes in hordes.</p>

<p>Their only attack is the usual <strong>bite</strong>, which does a bit of damage and
initiates a grab (escape DC 15). While the grab persists, the suckerling can
only make bite attacks against the grabbed target, but those hit
automatically. The target also takes ongoing damage equal to the number of
suckerlings attached to it, so be sure to make them gang up on the
squishies. Now there’s a nice mental image for you.</p>

<h3 id="death-husk-stirge-mv">Death Husk Stirge (MV)</h3>

<p>An undead stirge used as filling for a Bloated Zombie Surprise. It’s a Small
Natural Animate (undead), and a Level 6 Skirmisher with 71 HP. It has
darkvision, an immunity to poison, and 10 resistance to necrotic damage. It has
the usual stirge ground speed of 2 and flight speed of 6, but if it’s hit by
radiant damage it loses the ability to fly for a turn (and falls if it was in
the air).</p>

<p>Death husk stirges won’t stick to you, but they’ll still suck your blood. The
<strong>Rotted Blood</strong> attack (close blast 3 vs. Fortitude) allows them to spit the
blood stored inside their purulent intestines, dealing necrotic damage and
blinding those it hits for a turn. Undead in the blast can shift 2 squares as a
free action. This is an encounter power, but hitting someone with the basic
<strong>bite</strong> attack allows the stirge to recharge it.</p>

<p>As a move action, they can use <strong>Nimble Wing</strong> to fly 4 squares without
provoking opportunity attacks. When they hit 0 HP, they burst and those purulent
intestines produce a cloud of <strong>Necrotic Miasma</strong> (close burst 2 vs. Fortitude),
which deals a bit of necrotic damage and weakens for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="dire-stirge-both">Dire Stirge (Both)</h3>

<p>Indeed, like every bit of natural fauna in the setting, stirges have a dire
version. They’re larger, but not quite large enough to go up a size
category. They are however a lot meaner, being level 7 Lurkers with 60 HP.</p>

<p>Aside from the usual increased numbers due to being higher level, dire stirges
do 10 ongoing damage while attached and have an escape DC of 16. They are
otherwise mechanically identical to the level 1 variety.</p>

<h3 id="stirge-suckerling-swarm-mv">Stirge Suckerling Swarm (MV)</h3>

<p>For when you have so many suckerlings in play it becomes impractical to track
them individually. This swarm is a Level 10 Brute with 128 HP, and counts as a
Medium Natural Beast. It has a ground speed of 2 and a flight speed of 6.</p>

<p>This has the usual swarm traits. Its <strong>aura</strong> (1) makes anyone caught inside
begin taking 5 ongoing damage (save ends). If the victim is already taking
untyped ongoing damage, that damage increases by 5, with no stated limit. It’s a
nice way to model an incresing number of tiny stirges attaching themselves to
the victim.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Swarm of Suckerlings</strong> basic attack deals good damage and ongoing 5 damage
(save ends), so it can step up the aura’s timetable a bit.</p>

<p>When an adjacent enemy moves away from the swarm, it can use <strong>Hungry Flight</strong>
as an immediate reaction, flying up to its speed so it’s adjacent to the target
again. This does not provoke opportunity attacks!</p>

<h3 id="stirge-swarm-monster-manual">Stirge Swarm (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>What you get when those suckerlings grow up. This swarm is a Medium, Level 12
Brute with 141 HP. Being a MM monster, it’s a bit simpler. Aside from the usual
swarm traits, it has a basic attack that deals ongoing damage (save ends), and
an aura that allows it to make basic attacks against anyone caught inside as
free actions.</p>

<p>You’re probably better off leveling up the suckerling swarm.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>You can’t really tame stirges, since they’ll attack anything that has blood, but
sometimes kobolds and goblins use captured stirges as traps. Trigger the trap,
release the swarm! They can also be encountered as indiscriminate opportunists,
or in coincidental cooperation with things they won’t feed on.</p>

<p>The sample encounters provide two such examples of this: the first is 2 dire
stirges and 3 bloodweb spider swarms, the second 3 stirge swarms and a flesh
golem.</p>

<p>The “Large zombie minion full of undead stirges” setup has been hinted at
above, as well. For Maximum Carnage you could add the undead traits to a stirge
swarm stat block to get a swarm of death husk stirges.</p>

<p>I usually wouldn’t be very enthusiastic about stirges, but now I kinda want to
use the Zombie Surprise at least once.</p>

<p>Sphinxes are inspired by Greek and Egyptian mythology and have been in the game
at least since BECMI. Here, they are only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A sphinx is a holy guardian created in antiquity to protect a sacred place like
a tomb, temple, or shrine. In this task they can be found alone or in pairs, and
sometimes they also command other, lesser guardians. The ritual that creates
them is rare and powerful, binding an angelic spirit to the body of a celestial
lion.</p>

<p>Why would someone create a sphinx instead of a golem? There’s the matter of
style, of course. Golems would be preferred by a certain type of arcane caster,
while sphinxes feel like something a deity would allow its greatest servants to
make. There are also practical advantages: sphinxes are both sapient and quite
smart, so they can follow the intended spirit of their orders, and better
distinguish between people who are allowed to be there and people they should
eat.</p>

<p>One way they do this is through the <em>sphinx’s challenge</em>, where they try to
ascertain if someone has a right to be at the guarded location or not. Riddles
are a classic, but a sphinx can also ask for proof of ancestry, the solution to
an ethical or theological puzzle, or even just a specific password. The sphinx
is bound to let someone who passes the test proceed unmolested, though it’s
still going to attack if the visitors try to damage or rob the guarded location.</p>

<p>That’s all the book has to say about sphinxes, but I think we can speculate a
bit as well. Unlike most of other “guardian creatures” we saw so far, sphinxes
are neither constructs nor undead, yet the text implies they’re just as capable
of guarding their designed site for eternity. So I think it’s fair to say that
they are immune to age, hunger, thirst and possibly even sleep, at least when
performing their mission.</p>

<p>While the books emphasize the role of sphinxes as the guardians of “ancient” and
“forgotten” places, I think it’s also quite possible for them guard places that
are neither. Maybe the Pelorite cathedral or the big Temple-Library of Ioun have
a pair of sphinxes posted at their front entrance, even though they’re built
right in the middle of major population centers. Sphinxes are perfect for this
because they’re intelligent, and so they’re not going to attack innocent
visitors by mistake like a golem would.</p>

<p>A good sphinx might be hamstrung by overly specific or ethically questionable
bindings, though, so you could also have a scenario where a party carefully
helps the creature to free itself from its duties without triggering a fight.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>There’s only one stat block, so we’ll get right on it. Sphinxes are Large
Immortal Magical Beasts, and Level 16 Elite Soldiers with 304 HP. They have
trained Perception, Darkvision, plus a ground speed of 6, a flight speed of 8
(clumsy) and Overland Flight 10.</p>

<p>Their signature trait is the <strong>Sphinx’s Challenge</strong>, which gives us mechanics
for the concept described in the lore section: the sphinx will pose an out of
combat challenge to any potential intruders, and it can take whatever form the
GM thinks is appropriate. If the challenged party refuses to answer, or gets the
answer wrong, the sphinx will gain 1 extra action point and a +2 to attack,
damage, and defenses in the ensuing combat. Note that attacking the sphinx
before it can make its challenge counts as a refusal to answer! I think the only
case where the party can fight a sphinx without these bonuses is if they pass
the challenge and are later caught robbing the guarded place.</p>

<p>In combat, this sphinx is a straightforward physical threat. It attacks with
<strong>claws</strong>, it can <strong>pounce</strong> to make a charge and knock the target prone on a
hit, and it has a <strong>frightful roar</strong> (close burst 10 vs. will) which gives
victims a -2 penalty to defense (save ends). It can also use a <strong>Second Wind</strong>
once per encounter, which works like the PC version: the sphinx heals 75 HP and
gains +2 to all defenses for a turn.</p>

<p>It’s of course possible for the sphinx to know all sorts of rituals, and for the
GM to create custom sphinxes with the common traits above and a more magical
selection of combat abilities.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is level 15: 1 sphinx, 1 battle guardian, and 2 helmed
horrors. Indeed, a sphinx is smart enough that it could be given command of
those guardian constructs and employ them in interesting ways.</p>

<p>I like the concept of sphinxes, and I kinda want to run an adventure where the
sphinxes at the Temple-Library of Ioun are upstanding members of their community
and know everyone in the city by name.</p>

<p>Specters have been in the game since the beginning, and here they’re only on the
Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>When I talked about ghosts, I mentioned that every single synonym for that word
used to be its own entirely separate type of incorporeal undead, and that 4e
consolidated that a bit but not entirely. Specters are one of the undead that
retained their own entry.</p>

<p>Specters are incorporeal undead that can form “naturally” when an evil murderer
or other equally depraved villain dies. Unlike a ghost, they don’t retain any
memory of their life, and aren’t bound to a particular location. However,
they’re just as evil as they always were, and their new hatred of the living
ensures they keep looking for people to kill.</p>

<p>Specters tend to cling to other equally malevolent undead, and will sometimes
ally with evil living beings if that would ensure a steady supply of victims.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Specters are Medium Shadow Humanoid with the Undead keyword. They have
darkvision as well as both the <strong>insubstantial</strong> and <strong>phasing</strong> traits. If
you’re using Monster Vault-era rules this means they take half damage from
everything but force attacks, but when specters were published they took half
damage from all sources. Their HP is a bit lower than their level would
indicate, so being insubstantial doesn’t make fights last that much longer.</p>

<p>As undead, they’re immune to disease and poison and have some degree of necrotic
resistance and radiant vulnerability. They have no ground speed, but they fly,
and it’s not like you can force a specter to land.</p>

<h3 id="specter">Specter</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 4 Lurker with 30 HP and all the traits mentioned
above. It flies at speed 6, has 10 necrotic resistance, and 5 radiant
vulnerability.</p>

<p>The specter has a <strong>Spectral Chill</strong> aura (1), which inflicts a -2 penalty to
all enemy defenses. It attacks with a <strong>Spectral Touch</strong> that targets Reflex and
does necrotic damage. It can also unleash a <strong>Spectral Barrage</strong> (close burst 2
vs. Will) which does psychic damage and knocks prone. This is likely some sort
of scary illusion.</p>

<p>As a standard action, the specter can become <strong>invisible</strong> until it attacks or
is hit by an attack. It will likely alternate between attacking from
invisibility, and retreating while invisible.</p>

<h3 id="voidsoul-specter">Voidsoul Specter</h3>

<p>This is either the specter of someone really evil, or a basic model that has
grown bloated through years of post-mortem murder. It’s a Level 23 Lurker with
115 HP. Its necrotic resistance increases to 30, and its radiant vulnerability
to 10.</p>

<p><strong>Spectral Touch</strong> works the same with bigger numbers. The <strong>Spectral Chill</strong>
aura is stronger, dealing 10 cold damage to enemies caught inside in addition to
inflicting the same -2 defense penalty. Its special attack is <strong>Life Siphon</strong>
(Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude; encounter) which deals necrotic damage and makes
the specter heal 5 HP for every target damaged by it. Finally, its
<strong>invisibility</strong> works the same but becomes a 1/round minor action instead of a
standard one.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter has a basic specter, a deathlock wight, and a bunch of
zombies and skeletons.</p>

<p>Specters feel to me like one of those monsters that should have been rolled into
the “Ghost” entry. They don’t have much to distinguish them from ghosts or from
wraiths (the other surviving synomym). I’d guess that’s why they didn’t make the
Monster Vault.</p>

<p>I believe Sorrowsworn started out as a type of Forgotten Realms demon in 2e, but
now they’re something different. They’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Sorrowsworn resemble undead demons in appearance, though they’re neither demons
nor undead. Rather, they’re a sort of living avatar of death. Does that sound
contradictory to you? Deep mysteries tend to be like that.</p>

<p>You see, they’re not a natural species. Most are divine servitors of the Raven
Queen, transformed into their current state by her powers. Some were mortals
particularly attuned to death and its related concepts who managed to ascend on
their own.</p>

<p>Both types were often shadar-kai in their mortal lives. Becoming sorrowsworn is
seen by them as a glorious ascension, since it makes them not only ageless but
also more goth than anything mortal.</p>

<p>Sorrowsworn feed on grief, and so tend to hang out at the sites of great
catastrophes or conflicts. Those who serve the Raven Queen are also tasked with
hunting down beings who have cheated death. This doesn’t mean people who were
the subject of Raise Dead - rather, it’s people who have found a way to stick
around beyond their appointed time. Most often they’re some sort of undead like
vampires, liches or nightwalkers, but I guess someone who hunts phoenixes and
regularly huffs their powdered feathers would fit as well.</p>

<p>Sorrowsworn lairs are bleak caves and pits whose walls are covered in tiny
alcoves containing trophies from their past victims. These are arranged in
tableaus that each tell a more depressing story than the last. Flocks of
shadowravens (sinister half-spirit birds) hang out in these lairs, and swarm to
attack intruders. These swarms also often fly out with their sorrowsworn
masters, acting as heralds and allies to them in combat.</p>

<p>Their greatest enemies are the Nightwalkers, since they are anathema to all of
the Raven Queen’s precepts. Death Giants are also frequent foes. Of course,
despite their opposition to undeath they’re not really that nice themselves, and
have their own stuff going on when they’re not on holy missions for the Raven
Queen. That means they can easily end up fighting your PCs even when none of
them are guilty of cheating death.</p>

<p>As sorrowsworn like to fight with scythes, I figure the symbol of death in 4e’s
implied setting isn’t a robed skeleton, but a sorrowsworn. At least when it’s
not an image of the Raven Queen.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Sorrowsworn are Medium Shadow Humanoids and have Darkvision. Their signature
trait is <strong>Bleak Visage</strong>, a fear effect which inflicts a -2 penalty on melee
and ranged attacks targetting them (close and area attacks are unaffected).</p>

<p>They use scythes in combat and their powers are a blend of teleportation and
psychic attacks. They don’t have any elemental resistances of vulnerabilities,
which is interesting.</p>

<h3 id="sorrowsworn-soulripper">Sorrowsworn Soulripper</h3>

<p>This Level 25 Skirmisher has 236 HP and a land speed of 10. Unlike most of its
colleagues, it fights unarmed, with <strong>claws</strong> that do a mix of physical and
psychic damage, and deal extra damage when it has combat advantage.</p>

<p>It will often <strong>Flutter and Strike</strong> (recharge 5-6), which allows it to teleport
10 squares and make an attack with combat advantage at the arrival
point. <strong>Sorrow’s Rush</strong> is an encounter power that allows it to move 10 squares
and attack up to three different targets along the movement path.</p>

<h3 id="sorrowsworn-reaper">Sorrowsworn Reaper</h3>

<p>A Level 27 Soldier with 254 HP, this is likely the one that replaces the robed
skeleton as the D&amp;D setting’s “grim reaper” figure. It runs and climbs at speed
8, with Spider Climb.</p>

<p>It wields <strong>Sorrow’s Scythe</strong>, which does psychic damage and marks for a
turn. It can also use a <strong>Reaping Blow</strong> (recharge 6), which is stronger and
heals the reaper for 60 HP if it reduces the target to 0.</p>

<h3 id="sorrowsworn-deathlord">Sorrowsworn Deathlord</h3>

<p>This Level 28 Lurker (Leader) has 204 HP. It’s surrounded by an aura (1) of
<strong>Mournful Whispers</strong> that daze any enemies caught inside for a turn. It runs at
speed 8, flies at speed 10, and has phasing.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Dark Scythe</strong> deals necrotic and psychic damage, and weakens for a
turn. It can also <strong>Reap and Fade</strong> (recharge 3-6), which allows it to make an
attack, teleport 10 squares, and become insubtantial for a turn in that order.</p>

<p>This is a lurker that inverts the usual routine! Instead of attacking every
other turn, it can only <em>be attacked</em> every other turn, assuming it takes care
to phase into a wall, floor, or ceiling after it attacks. So it moves in,
attacks, and is exposed until its next action, when it attacks and moves
away. Reap and Fade makes it even harder to pin down, as it can move in and use
the ability to attack and immediately move away again.</p>

<h3 id="shadowraven-swarm">Shadowraven Swarm</h3>

<p>A shadowraven swarm counts as a Medium Shadow Beast with the Swarm
keyword. It’s a Level 27 Brute with 296 HP. It has a land speed of 2 and a
flight speed of 12, and all the standard swarm traits: a Swarm Attack aura, half
damage from single target attacks, and 10 extra damage from area ones.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>Swam of Talons</strong> that does a mix of physical and
necrotic damage. Once bloodied, it can use the <strong>Murder’s Wrath</strong> encounter
power, allowing it to fly 6 squares, move through other creatures’s squares, and
make a basic attack against anyone whose square it moves through.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Sorrowsworn tend to group with each other, with deathlords running the show and
the others following their orders. They’re often accompanied by shadowraven
swarms, and ride fell wyverns.</p>

<p>One of the sample encounters here also has them alongside the epic-level
dragonborn deathknight, which hints that not all of them hate undead.</p>

<p>Sorrowsworn fill the same niche as rot harbingers: as regulars, they’re supposed
to be the basic building block for encounters in a late Epic adventure focusing
on their patron. I feel they work a lot better, though, as they have more
interesting maneuvers in their stat blocks. They also don’t rely exclusively on
necrotic damage, so it’s harder to get protection against their attacks.</p>

<p>I guess this explains why Orcus isn’t likely to usurp the Raven Queen anytime
soon!</p>

<p>You can still use sorrowsworn in a campaign where the PCs aren’t likely to
oppose the Raven Queen. There might very well be renegade sorrowsworn out there,
and you could also reskin them and make them undead to use as better rot
harbingers in a campaign focused on opposing Orcus.</p>

<p>Snakes have been in the game since the beginning. They are present both in the
Monster Manual and in the animal appendix of the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Snakes are real world animals, but there’s a huge body of legend surrounding
them in practically every culture. D&amp;D seems to be partial to the Western
depiction of snakes as treacherous and deadly, since it has Zehir as one of its
evil gods.</p>

<p>Still, this entry focuses on <em>monstrous</em> snakes. The mundane varieties likely
behave pretty much as they do in the real world, with a lot of them being
harmless and the dangerous ones only attacking if they feel threatened.</p>

<p>Though monstrous snakes are large and aggressive enough to actively hunt people,
most are still merely dangerous animals. A rare few might be blessed by Zehir,
though, which makes them sapient, evil, and more powerful.</p>

<p>Between the two books we have quite a lot of different snake stat blocks.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Snakes are so varied that they have little in common that I can discuss
here. They’re all beasts, they all have the Reptile keyword, and they all
bite. That’s it.</p>

<h3 id="spitting-cobra-monster-vault">Spitting Cobra (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>The closest you’ll get to a real snake here. Spitting Cobras are Small Natural
Beasts, and Level 5 Minion Soldiers. Their <strong>bite</strong> does poison damage and marks
for a turn, and their <strong>Blinding Spittle</strong> (ranged 5 vs. Reflex; recharge 4+)
does the same damage and blinds (save ends).</p>

<p>I could see an eccentric kobold artificer firing these out of a cannon, or a
priest of Zehir summoning them out of thin air.</p>

<h3 id="deathrattle-viper-both">Deathrattle Viper (Both)</h3>

<p>Pretty much a dire rattlesnake. It inhabits forests, jungles, and caves, though
they wouldn’t look out of place in a desert either. These vipers are Medium
Natural Beasts, and Level 5 Brutes with 75 HP. They have low-light vision, and
resist 10 poison. Their land speed is 4, and they also have a climb speed of 4.</p>

<p>Their bony tails produce a magically enhanced <strong>Death Rattle</strong> that acts as an
aura (2) which inflicts a -2 attack penalty to all enemies inside. This is a
fear effect.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> allows a secondary attack vs. Fortitude on a hit, which delivers
their venom in the form of immediate and ongoing poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Deathrattle Vipers also appear in the Monster Vault, and are identical aside
from their updated bite damage. Their low speed makes running away from them a
feasible tactic even for someone in heavy armor, so they should be paired with
other monsters that make this more difficult.</p>

<h3 id="crushgrip-constrictor-both">Crushgrip Constrictor (Both)</h3>

<p>This is what you’d get if all the shit they say about boas and anacondas was
true. They’re found in jungles, marshes, and underground. Constrictors are Large
Natural Beasts and Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They have land, climb and swim
speeds of 6. They’re the other snake that exists in both books.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> does damage and grabs on a hit, as the snake quickly coils around
the target. The escape DC 25 for Athletics and 22 for Acrobatics in the MM, and
a gentler 17 in the MV.</p>

<p>Against a grabbed target they can <strong>Constrict</strong>, which targets Fortitude, does a
nice chunk of physical damage, and dazes for a turn.</p>

<p>No explicit mention is made of how many targets the snake can have grabbed. If
you’re being relatively realistic, it should be just one. Larger or more
supernatural versions might be able to coil around multiple unfortunates.</p>

<h3 id="flame-snake-monster-manual">Flame Snake (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>A snake from the Elemental Chaos. Not much is written about its origins, so it
could be a case of parallel evolution or one of those rare instances where
creatures from the world migrated to the other planes and adapted to them. As
fire elementals, they can be summoned and controlled by magic.</p>

<p>Flame Snakes are Medium Elemental Beasts with the Fire and Reptile
keywords. They’re Level 9 Artillery with 74 HP and Resist Fire 20. They have a
speed of 6, but can’t climb or swim. They also can’t see in the dark, though
it’s reasonable to say their incandescent bodies would shed light.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> does a mix of physical and fire damage, and they can <strong>Spit
Fire</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex), doing both immediate and ongoing fire damage
(save ends).</p>

<h3 id="shadow-snake-monster-manual">Shadow Snake (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>The blessed of Zehir, these two-headed monsters are made of solid shadow and are
venerated by Yuan-ti. They’re level 16 Skirmishers with 158 HP. They slither at
speed 7 and have a climb speed of 7. Their Int is 4: they’re not exactly
sapient, but are very cunning, and also Evil.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bites</strong> do physical and ongoing poison damage (save ends), and they can
make <strong>Double Attacks</strong> because of the two heads. Once per encounter they can
make a <strong>Shifting Shadowstrike</strong>, shifting their speed (7) and biting two
different targets as they do so.</p>

<p>Also once per encounter, they can <strong>Vanish Into the Night</strong>, which makes them
insubstantial, gives them phasing, and makes them invisible in dim light. All of
this lasts for a turn and makes for an excellent “escape hatch” when the fight
starts to go badly. I imagine shadow snakes very rarely fight to the death -
they’d be smart enough to cut and run.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual seems to think reptiles gotta stick together, so it has a
bunch of encounters that feature snakes alongside level-appropriate sapient
reptiles that act as their handlers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Death rattlers and lizardfolk</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Constrictors and snaketongue cultists (which aren’t reptiles, exactly, but are
close enough).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flame Snakes and troglodytes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shadow Snakes and yuan-ti.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I imagine you could use death rattlers as “minibosses” in low-level adventures
featuring kobolds, as well.</p>

<p>These snakes don’t exactly rock my world, but I feel they’re still a good
addition to the game.</p>
