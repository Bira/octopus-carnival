<p>The Uthgardt are the barbarians of this Frozen North, more Conan-like than
Viking-like. They’re one of the many people descended from the citizens of the
human empire of Netheril, which scattered in a lot of different directions when
that empire fell overnight. The ancestors of the Uthgardt stayed in the region
when one of the Netherese flying islands fell here, and learned how to live off
the land. They take their name from Uthgar, a mythical ancestor who was so
badass he ascended to godhood and became one of the exarchs of Tempus, the FR
god of war. There are many Uthgardt tribes today, each one named after a
different kind of animal they admire and try to emulate. All of them venerate
Uthgar along with a series of tribe-specific primal spirits, and don’t pay much
attention to other gods.</p>

<p>A PC with this background belongs to the Thunderbeast tribe, who lives in the
High Forest way to the east of our regional map. A bit before the campaign
started, the tribe engaged in their annual custom of the Runemeet, when all of
them travel to their ancestral holy site to worship the spirits and perform
several important rites. The Thunderbeast’s site is a burial mound in
Neverwinter Wood, the resting place of one of Uthgar’s companions. The skeleton
of a great thunderbeast (which I guess is a type of dinosaur?) rests atop this
mound.</p>

<p>Or at least it used to. This year, the tribe found the mound dug up - whoever
did it carted off both the skeleton and the contents of the tomb beneath. The PC
was supposed to perform a sacred hunt as their coming-of-age ceremony, but the
elders decide to change their plans and charge the PC with a different quest:
find out who did this, make them pay, and restore the mound.</p>

<p>The tribe returns home, but the PC stays to await the return of the Grey Wolf
tribe, who lives nearby and who left for their own Runemeet elsewhere. They
should know who the desecrators are… and if it turns out <em>they</em> are the
desecrators, then the PC has another target for their hunt.</p>

<p>The Uthgardt disdain arcane magic, so most Uthgardt PCs will belong to martial,
divine, or primal classes. Still, there are no hard restrictions and you could
be a secret arcanist if you want added complications. The same goes for
characters who worship anyone other than Uthgar and the primal spirits.</p>

<p>Similarly, Thunderbeast Uthgardt are all human, and you need a good reason to be
something else (i.e, you or one of your parents was adopted into the tribe).</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>At Level 1, they gain the <strong>Thunderbeast Stomp</strong> encounter power. Stomping is a
minor action, and the resulting shockwaves act as an aura (2) that prevents
enemies inside from making opportunity attacks. It lasts for a turn, which is
enough to let the character run right past a defender line and charge the enemy
squishies.</p>

<p>At level 5, the PC gains a +4 to Perception checks made to find tracks, and a +4
to Insight when dealing with beasts and other Uthgardt. The bonuses are
specific, but also untyped, which is good.</p>

<p>At level 10, the character’s reputation as a barbarian hero gives them a +3
power bonus to Intimidate.</p>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>These powers center on communion with primal spirits.</p>

<p><strong>Spiritual Guidance</strong> is a level 2 daily power that lets the PC reroll a
Nature, Religion, or History check they dislike with a +5 bonus. The spirits of
the ancestors chime in to help you.</p>

<p><strong>Strength of the Beast</strong> is a level 6 daily power that gives the PC a +4 power
bonus to Athletics and Strength checks until the end of the encounter. Good for
skill challenges or feats of strength during combat.</p>

<p><strong>Spirit Swarm</strong> is a level 10 power that directly summons the PC’s ancestor
spirits to help in combat. This minor action creates a zone in a Close
Burst 2. Enemies inside the zone cannot regain HP or gain temporary HP. Allies
who enter or end their turns in the zone gain 5 temporary HP.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>This theme can make characters of any class feel like Barbarians, and any actual
Barbarians will be Barbarier-than-thou. There’s little to aid in combat here,
but the skill bonuses will go a long way in the appropriate campaign.</p>

<p>Looks like the typical Uthgardt has a hard time relating peacefully to people
outside their culture, so a PC in a mixed party is a somewhat atypical
individual by definition. Multiple PCs could easily take it in the same party
with the simple explanation that the tribe left behind a team instead of an
individual. A party where everyone has this theme would be extremely
uninterested in the fate of Neverwinter, and would single-mindedly pursue their
quest.</p>

<p>Okay, so back in Olden Times there was an elven empire named Illefarn that
reached as far as the North. Over the course of history this empire broke up
into three successor states. The one that covered our current region of interest
was named Iliyanbruen. This is important because if you get the two confused the
surviving eladrin of Iliyanbruen will tut-tut at you.</p>

<p>You see, when Netheril’s magic winked out, one of their floating islands fell on
the Neverwinter Wood. This was a disaster for both the humans living on the
island and the nation of Iliyanbruen that happened to be beneath it. Many of its
inhabitants decided to call it quits and move to Evermeet, which means more or
less leaving the world behind for good. Others decided to try and preserve their
culture, and enacted a ritual to move their capital city of Shandarar to the
Feywild.</p>

<p>Their new home was anything but safe, though, as a lot of the same beings who
had driven the original elves away from the Feywild at the dawn of time were
still there and they didn’t like the arrival of these invaders one bit. After a
period of strife, though, the elves managed to re-establish their nation there.</p>

<p>Iliyanbruen still exists in the modern day, its borders a ways away from the
place where Shandarar used to be. With the coming of the Spellplague, the world
and the Feywild began to enter in conjunction, which made the crossing once
again possible. After a lengthy battle to drive a covey of hags away from
Shandarar, the eladrin managed to send scouts and explorers though to the
world.</p>

<p>As a side note, I don’t know if the people of Iliyanbruen became eladrin after
millennia of living in the Feywild or if they were already a type of elf that
got recast as eladrin when the editions changed. We’ll be looking into some of
those later.</p>

<p>Anyway, upon arriving at the world, the eladrin of Iliyanbruen were horrified to
learn the old ruins of their empire were not only in a state of disrepair but
had also been looted and plundered. They were quite mad about it. You leave your
stuff lying around for a mere three thousand years and these uppity mortals
think they can come and take it. What an outrage!</p>

<p>The eladrin of New Shandarar began debating what to do and soon fell into two
distinct camps. One faction wants to invade the world in force and rain
vengeance upon anyone who lingers near the ruins of Iliyanbruen (i.e, everyone
in our regional map). The other also wants to restore the old cities to their
glory, but only wants to take revenge on the people directly responsible for the
thefts. This does require learning who these people are.</p>

<p>The PC is one of the investigators responsible for finding this out. They helped
retake Sharandar from the hags, were among the first to arrive on the world, and
decided to make it their home as they try to reconstruct the history of the
ruins and find the thieves. They belong to the moderate faction, and as the
campaign starts they’re getting desperate for results because the firebrands
back home are about to win the debate. They need concrete results, and fast, if
the world is to avoid an eladrin invasion.</p>

<p>Even worse, the main obstacle to their investigation isn’t the ludicrously large
time scale. No, it seems there’s someone out there actively trying to prevent
eladrin investigators from finding anything out, usually by murdering them. It’s
dangerous to go alone.</p>

<p>This theme is open to eladrin PCs of any class. Not all inhabitants of modern
Iliyanbruen are eladrin, but all of the features and powers here are aimed at
powering up their Fey Step.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>At level 1, PC can take one adjacent ally with them when they use Fey Step. The
ally also appears adjacent to the PC.</p>

<p>At level 5, they gain a +2 power bonus to History and Nature checks.</p>

<p>At level 10, they can use Fey Step as a minor action instead of a move
action.</p>

<h2 id="optional-powers">Optional Powers</h2>

<p>Most of these are yet more teleport-related power-ups.</p>

<p><strong>Blink Away</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that lets the PC teleport 2 squares
as a reaction to an enemy ending their turn adjacent to the PC.</p>

<p><strong>Evasive Step</strong> is a level 6 daily power that lets then use Fey Step as an
interrupt if an enemy attacks them while Fey Step is unexpended.</p>

<p><strong>Feywild Will</strong> is a level 10 daily power that gives the PC a +2 power bonus to
Will and to saving throws until the end of the encounter. Whenever the PC
succeeds at a save while this is active, they gain 5 + WIS Modifier temporary
HP.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Peeking ahead a bit I see Forgotten Realms’ Moon and Sun elves are eladrin
variants in 4e. I remember they were both huge assholes, so it’s not a surprise
the eladrin of Iliyanbruen are just as unpleasant even if they’re only their
distant relatives.</p>

<p>Most other PCs would be very interested in preventing an invasion from
Iliyanbruen from adding to their troubles, so they’re natural allies of the
moderate Guardian. And this is another one of those themes that easily supports
multiple PCs, or even a whole mono-theme party (it’s a <em>team</em> of
investigators). Such a party would be mostly uninterested in Neverwinter’s
political woes, except where they intersect with their quest.</p>

<p>If you want to optimize for the ability to do Teleport Shenanigans, this is the
theme for you. Little could stop a whole party of them from getting to where
they want to go. For other campaigns, it would also be relatively easy to strip
the standard Iliyanbruen backstory and just say a PC with this theme is a native
of the Feywild who moved to the world.</p>

<p>Luskan is a coastal city a ways north of Neverwinter. In the games, it was a
pirate and thief-infested cesspool secretly ruled by a cabal of evil
wizards. The evil wizards were defeated in a novel before the start of the
events in this book, so now it’s just exactly what it always appeared to be.</p>

<p>The Dead Rats are currently the most successful thieves’ guild in Luskan. They
have this name because their senior members are wererats, and their initiation
ceremony involves a ritual that imparts some wererat powers to the
initiate. Their leader is a halfling bard named Toytere, also known as “King
Toy”, who seems to have the power to see the future and uses it to foil the many
assassination attempts made on him.</p>

<p>A PC with this background used to be an average member of the Rats until they
were brought in before King Toy, who proclaimed the PC was destined to lead a
mutiny against him and ordered their execution. This was news to the PC, who
barely made it out of the room alive and managed to abscond to Neverwinter.</p>

<p>Their original goal here was to build enough wealth and power to return to
Luskan and take revenge on those who wronged them, but this might have changed
by the time the campaign starts.</p>

<p>Dead Rat Deserter PCs are usually shifty and shady types, though they’re loyal
to their friends (who include the other PCs). While rogues are the first to come
to mind, there aren’t any class restrictions. Characters should be either
humans, half-elves, or halflings, since those are the majority ancestries in
Luskan and make up all of the Dead Rat membership.</p>

<p>The background skills for this theme are Intimidate, Stealth, and Thievery.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>You don’t need a theme just to make a shifty character with a shady criminal
past, so why choose this one? Because it also lets you be a <em>wererat</em>!</p>

<p>The level 1 feature is <strong>Body of the Rat</strong>, an 1/round minor-action at-will
power that lets the PC assume the form of a Tiny rat. The same power also lets
them change back, and whenever they change shape they can also shift 1
square. In rat form, the PC can’t attack but gains a climb speed equal to half
their ground speed and a +4 to Stealth checks. The PC’s equipment melds into the
rat form, and continues to provide all of its passive benefits. There are a few
exceptions: they don’t get AC bonuses from shields, can’t use active item
powers, and can’t access any containers (like bags or potion vials). On the
other hand, their equipment can’t be removed in any way while it’s part of the
rat form.</p>

<p>At level 5, the PC gains a +2 power bonus to Stealth and Bluff. This is useful
for a rogue-type, but would be much better if it was untyped.</p>

<p>At Level 10, <strong>Hybrid Bite</strong> lets the PC assume the classic hybrid wererat
form. Changing back and forth is an at-will minor action, like above, and the
character retains all their equipment and can use it normally. The hybrid form
has the same size as the character. The character also gains a bite attack. The
attack bonus for this is (STR or DEX modifier)+4, and the damage is 1d8+(same
modifier) plus 5 ongoing damage (save ends). The bonus increases to +6 and the
damage to 2d8 at level 21.</p>

<p>This attack is a little underwhelming, I think. If Strength or Dexterity is your
main attack stat, it’s going to be about on par with a +2 weapon with a +2
proficiency bonus, which means it’s less accurate than the characters’s actual
main weapon if any of those stats are better on it. Ongoing damage on an at-will
is good, but also maybe not as good as the bonuses of a level 10’s character
main weapon and class powers. If you use anything other than STR or DEX to
attack, this power is useless.</p>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>The optional powers here are all about tapping into your inner rat.</p>

<p><strong>Savage Hiss</strong> is a level 2 encounter power that helps intimidate enemies in a
fight. When the PC scores a critical hit, they can use this power to inflict
every enemy within 5 squares with a -4 penalty to attack the PC for a turn.</p>

<p><strong>Dead Rat Stealth</strong> is a level 6 daily power that takes a minor action and
gives the PC a +2 power bonus to Stealth and Thievery for the rest of the
encounter. If the PC dislikes a roll for one of these skills, they can end the
effect and reroll it with a +5 power bonus.</p>

<p><strong>Intuitive Leap</strong> is a Level 10 daily power that represents the PC inheriting
some of King Toy’s prophetic abilities. The PC can use it when it’s time to roll
initiative, gaining a +4 power bonus to the roll and being able to stand up or
move their speed for free at that point.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Mechanically, this theme suits high-Dex characters the best, since it boosts
Stealth and Thievery and might let a character who lacks both to get access to
one of them. Being able to turn into a normal-looking rat can enable <em>all sorts</em>
of shenanigans, especially out of combat, but the hybrid form and bite attack
are of dubious utility at best. This is not a theme that will do a lot to boost
your damage output.</p>

<p>Story-wise, I haven’t gotten far enough into the book to see whether Luskan and
the Rats influence Neverwinter in any significant way. It’s possible a Rat would
just be along for the ride if they’re the only one in the party. An <em>all-Rat</em>
party would result in a significantly different path than those implied by the
other paths we saw so far. They all got set up together and would still retain
their goal of getting rich and powerful enough to return and get some revenge,
likely causing a lot of chaos in Neverwinter in the process.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/05/05/neverwinter-harper.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: Harper Agent</a>
        </h1>

<p>From what I remember, the Harpers used to be a “good conspiracy” back the “old
days” of the Forgotten Realms. A secret society dedicated to doing good,
fighting for freedom, and keeping the many evil factions of the setting in
check. Elminster was a big fan, and several of the setting’s iconic NPCs were
members.</p>

<p>Those Harpers got destroyed during the Spellplague, but sixty years before our
narrative present a new group took up the name. This incarnation of the group is
mostly focused on stopping the machinations of those Netheril survivors who came
out of the Shadowfell, though they also have their fingers in other pies.</p>

<p>A PC with this background has a very specific and rather tense backstory. They
always dreamed of joining the Harpers, and traveled to Everlund to apply. They
were given a trial mission - to go to Neverwinter and link up with a woman named
Cymril. Cymril was not only a fully-fledged Harper Agent but also the leader of
the Sons of Alagondar. The Sons are a group of rebels who opposes Dagult
Neverember, and who fight for an independent Neverwinter.</p>

<p>The PC gets included in night-time recon mission led by Cymril herself, and
their group gets ambushed by a force of Neverember’s mercs. In panic, the PC
hides, and then gets to witness as the rebels are massacred. The thing is,
Cymril herself turned coat as soon as the fight started, and began killing her
own underlings! In the end, the hidden PC is the only survivor on the rebel
side: Cymril gets taken out by one of her lieutenants, who in turn dies to the
mercenaries. They leave the rebels’ bodies on the street as a warning. Our PC as
the foresight to steal Cymril’s Harper pin before absconding.</p>

<p>So the title of “Harper Agent” is kind of misleading. The PC is actually a
<em>rogue</em> agent, sympathetic to the organization’s ideals but operating without
their official support. The PC can’t let it become known that they’re not a real
Harper, and even without that secret coming out they’re already facing suspicion
from the very rebel group they were supposed to help, for being the only
survivor of the ambush that killed Cymril.</p>

<p>A PC with this background wishes to discover the truth behind that massacre,
prove their innocence, and fulfill their original mission of preventing
Neverember from becoming the cutthroat merchant-king he wishes to be. This theme
brings even more intrigue and spy games into the game than the Neverwinter
Noble.</p>

<p>There are no class or race prerequisites, though the book recommends Harper
characters be good at subterfuge and say many of them multiclass into bard,
rogue, ranger or wizard.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>This class gains only a single feature: that Harper Pin pried from Cymril’s
corpse. It marks the bearer as a member of the Harpers, brings with it a
blessing from one of their patron goddesses, and can be used as a key to secret
Harper hideouts and caches.</p>

<p>Mechanically, it’s a Rare Level 3 Wondrous Item, which means it doesn’t take up
any slots and can’t be bought in stores. The PC chooses one of three possible
blessings at character creation, and this becomes the pin’s item encounter
power. <strong>Llira’s Grace</strong> lets them roll 1d6 and add it to an attack roll they
just missed, potentially turning it into a hit. <strong>Mielikki’s Endurance</strong> lets
them reduce incoming damage from an attack by 5 + half level. And <strong>Tymora’s
Luck</strong> lets them re-roll a save with a +2 bonus to the new roll.</p>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>This class’s optional utility powers continue to follow the themes of the divine
blessings above.</p>

<p><strong>Harper’s Healing Boon</strong> is a level 2 daily power that can be used as an
interrupt when the PC is hit by an attack. They take only half damage from the
attack and can immediately roll a save.</p>

<p><strong>Unexpected Ally</strong> is a level 6 power that represents the PC use fast-talk to
trick an enemy into believing the PC is a secret ally of theirs. This means the
enemy can’t make opportunity attacks against the PC and grants combat advantage
to them. The effect ends when the PC attacks the fooled enemy.</p>

<p><strong>Resourceful Dastard</strong> (yes, with a D) is a level 10 daily power. It’s a stance
that gives +4 to all defenses when the PC has cover or concealment, and lets
them ignore all difficult terrain when shifting.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>This theme is very strongly oriented towards rogue, bard, or even ranger PCs, I
feel. Its blessing and utility power can help make these characters less fragile
and more mobile.</p>

<p>A criticism I’d make is that this one is a lot less generic than the other
themes we saw so far. With a background like that, it’s a bit hard to make the
PC anything other than a rogue Harper in the Neverwinter region of the Forgotten
Realms. It’s also almost impossible to have more than one Harper Agent in a
party unless you change that very detailed background and come up with another
reason why they can’t contact out-of-town Harpers for support.</p>

<p>A Harper Agent in a party has reasons to cozy up to and aid the Neverwinter
Noble, and provides a good hook for the GM to introduce the group to the Sons of
Alagondar (or what’s left of them). Cooperation would not be automatic, since
the Sons distrust the Harper, but it would be a start. The Agent would also try
to convince any other neutral PCs to oppose Neverember.</p>

<p>Oghma is the Forgotten Realms god of knowledge and thought, occupying the
roughly the same position as Ioun does in the default 4e setting. This
particular PC is one of his worshipers, and for a while now they’ve been
receiving dreams and visions from the god. These start as nightmares, but soon
the threats are burned away by divine fire and the dreamer finds themselves in a
grand hall where the sound of a water clock can be heard.</p>

<p>The meaning of these visions is clear: the faithful must go to Neverwinter and
restore the House of Knowledge, a big temple to Oghma that was destroyed in the
eruption. Neverwinter used to produce famously accurate water clocks, you
see. This, and many of the city’s other lost craft secrets, could be restored
from the temple’s archive, if it still survives. This would help the city’s
reconstruction immensely, and of course bring the worship of Oghma back to the
region in a big way.</p>

<p>This is about as lofty a goal as that of the Noble, though it’s much less
concerned with secular politics. The Faithful is still going to need allies, and
so has a ready-made reason to work together with any other PCs interested in
restoring the city.</p>

<p>Oghma’s Faithful can belong to any race or class. Though the book says the theme
fits divine characters better, the actual powers printed here surprisingly good
for skill-monkeys from all power sources. Essentials Clerics can also pick up an
Oghma domain, shown later. The theme’s background skills are History, Religion,
and Streetwise.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>At level 1, the Faithful gains the <strong>Understand Language</strong> power, an encounter
power that lets the PC choose a language they’ve heard or seen in the last 24
hours and become able to understand it until the end of the encounter. Outside
of combat, that would be about 5 minutes, but as this is an encounter power you
might as well consider the PC constantly able to understand that language during
extended exploration sequences.</p>

<p>At level 5 the PC gains another power, <strong>Sudden Insight</strong>, which once per
encounter lets them re-roll a skill check and take the second result. This is
any skill, not just knowledge ones.</p>

<p>At level 10, they gain a +4 bonus to Perception checks made “to search”, which I
guess means to actively search for something (such as traps, treasure, or the
right book in the temple’s archive).</p>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>As always, these become additional options when it’s time for the PC to choose
utility powers.</p>

<p><strong>Learned Response</strong> is a level 2 daily power that lets the PC use the result of
an Insight check as their initiative for that combat. Even to me this feels a
little too narrow in scope, but it does mean the low-Dex cleric will act much
earlier once per day.</p>

<p><strong>Bad Idea</strong> is a Level 6 encounter power which can be used as an interrupt when
an adjacent creature attacks the PC. The PC slides the attacker 2 squares to
another adjacent space, and inflicts a -2 penalty to its attacks and saves for a
turn. Good for melee skirmisher-types like rogues or avengers. Clerics probably
have something better to choose here from their class.</p>

<p><strong>Tactical Inspiration</strong> is a level 10 encounter power that lets the PC shift 3
squares to be adjacent to an enemy as a move action, and also allow an ally
within 5 squares to shift 3 squares for free. I could see a warlord or rogue
taking this too, to help gain combat advantage earlier.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>This feels less spectacular to me than the Neverwinter Noble theme, as I’m not
very enthusiastic about the FR pantheon. Mechanics-wise, it’s mostly about
improving your skill checks, which can be awesome in the sort of campaign
suggested by this book where you can have plenty of non-combat investigative and
intrigue scenarios. It’s probably not going to do much for your combat
effectiveness, though.</p>

<p>Multiple PCs with this background are very easy to accommodate in the same
party, as they would all share a common cause and would have every reason to
work together.</p>
