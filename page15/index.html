<p>A common complaint I hear about people who tried GURPS for the first time coming
in from other systems is that the “flow” of combat feels odd. Mainly that those
1-second turns are too short and don’t let you do enough. Sometimes also that
these short turns lead to fights that end too quickly to be dramatic<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I think this comes from a mismatch between the player’s learned expectations and
the way GURPS actually does things. In this post I’ll try to describe this
difference, and give a few suggestions on how to reduce the friction.</p>

<h2 id="describing-the-difference">Describing the Difference</h2>

<p>Let’s start with an example. You’re in a typical dungeon fantasy combat against
a bunch of zombies, playing an archer character. You make an attack, and
describe it like this:</p>

<p>“I draw and nock an arrow, then I take aim at the closest zombie and shoot! As
soon as the arrow flies, I’m already drawing another one from my quiver!”</p>

<p>How do other systems<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> usually handle this, and what does GURPS do that’s so
different?</p>

<h3 id="abstract-action-economies">Abstract Action Economies</h3>

<p>Most tabletop RPG systems are fairly abstract when it comes to combat. To the
rules, it doesn’t matter what motions your PC is actually going through when
they perform an action, nor does it matter how long a turn lasts. It is enough
to know what the action is, and that a turn is long enough for you to do it.</p>

<p>In systems that work this way, our archer’s narration is just a cool
embellishment that adds some fun detail to a standard ranged attack roll. All
the rules need to know is that it’s a ranged attack.</p>

<p>However, the choice of which actions perform in your turn matters a lot. You get
a certain number of them, all of which have an immediate effect in the current
turn but don’t influence future ones. Therefore the system’s incentives gently
push you to be maximally efficient on a turn-by-turn basis<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Attacks are good
because they bring the fight closer to an end. If you use your main action for
something else, it better bring as much benefit to you as attacking would, or
you have just “wasted” your turn. This set of mechanics and incentives is
usually called an “action economy”.</p>

<h3 id="the-gurps-way">The GURPS Way</h3>

<p>Where other systems are abstract, GURPS is so concrete it’s practically
brutalist. Turns last one second and its combat maneuvers are a lot more
fine-grained than combat actions in other games.</p>

<p>In the Union of Generic Universal Republics our example description is not just
a bit of flavor: it’s a five-turn plan. Ready (draw arrow), Ready (nock arrow),
Aim, Attack, Ready (draw arrow)<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Only the actual blow from your weapon, press of the trigger, or release of the
bowstring counts as an Attack. The other stuff in the plan above are maneuvers
that make your Attack possible and set it up for success. In GURPS, you want to
increase the <em>quality</em> of your attacks, not necessarily their <em>quantity</em>.</p>

<p>For the same reason GURPS is a bit less amenable to “needless embellishment”
than more abstract games. Combat goes much more smoothly when you keep your
action declarations to short sentences that map to a single maneuver. The
structure you build out of these simple blocks can end up looking every bit as
beautiful as the freeform narrative, though. This too, is brutalism.</p>

<h2 id="proposed-solutions">Proposed Solutions</h2>

<p>“The GURPS way” is neither better nor worse than the action economies of other
systems. It’s just different. But it’s different enough that it can trip up
people coming in from other games.</p>

<p>If the description above helped you smooth the friction between the rules and
your expectations, then great! But it’s likely that it didn’t, and you still
having trouble with it. In that case, here are a couple of suggestions on how to
make your experience smoother.</p>

<h3 id="solution-1-its-a-character-skill-issue">Solution 1: It’s a (Character) Skill Issue</h3>

<p>One of the big reasons to use “setup” maneuvers like Evaluate, Feint, and Aim is
that your character’s skill level might not be high enough to give you a decent
chance of success. Without those maneuvers, you’ll end up missing more often, or
will have trouble getting past your enemy’s defenses. This is common at the core
books’ default 150 points.</p>

<p>One way to make attacking every turn more feasible and fun is to raise the power
level of your characters. This is the approach taken by Dungeon Fantasy and
Action: not only do they use 250 point templates, they optimize them a fair bit.</p>

<p>All the physical combatant templates in DF start with 16 in their main combat
skill <em>at the very least</em>. Many have a 18, and a couple either start with a 20
or can get there with a bit of point shuffling.</p>

<p>This might sound excessive at first glance. Your base chance of success doesn’t
increase past 16, and it’s unlikely anyone had more than a 18 in all of human
history. Why allow PCs to <em>start</em> there, and possibly go even higher with earned
points? Because this is what you need to be able to reliably attack every second
without taking the time to perform setup maneuvers.</p>

<p>With these “overpowered” skill levels you can absorb more penalties without
having to Evaluate or Aim to offset them, and you can use Deceptive Attacks
instead of Feints without affecting your chances of success. If you still have
enough spare skill levels left, you can even thrown in a Rapid Strike to make
two attacks in that second.</p>

<h2 id="solution-2-mandatory-dramatic-pauses">Solution 2: Mandatory Dramatic Pauses</h2>

<p>Fighters in real-world combat sports and action movies don’t spend every second
of their fights furiously attacking each other. They’ll circle while looking for
openings, stop to catch their breaths, and only go in for an exchange of actual
blows every once in a while.</p>

<p>The use of setup maneuvers helps stretch fights out to be more similar to these
examples, but if you’re reading this it’s because you don’t think they’re a good
solution. And even if you do, you might want to go further.</p>

<p>One way to do this is to crib from the rules for tournament fights in GURPS
Martial Arts. Under those rules, fights are composed of <em>lulls</em> and
<em>flurries</em>. Combatants can only use the Attack maneuver<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> during a
flurry. During a lull, they cannot attack but can still use maneuvers like
Change Posture, Evaluate, Move, Ready, Aim, or even just Do Nothing while
waiting for an opening. In fantasy settings it would be a good time to cast
those healing spells.</p>

<p>GURPS Martial Arts has flurries last for 2d seconds and lulls for 4d seconds,
rolled at the start of the corresponding period. You can tweak these durations
to best suit your campaign. If the combatants’ actions look like they’re going
to force an early change, you can end the current “period” early.</p>

<p>The main purpose of introducing lulls is to extend a fight’s in-character
duration to something like that of a real-world boxing or MMA round. They can
also help change the mental “efficiency” calculation of someone who’s used to
action economies. If there’s a part of the fight where you can’t attack,
performing setup actions for when you can becomes the most efficient thing to
do.</p>

<p>Lulls work both in melee and ranged combat (when everyone might hunker down
behind cover for a while), but they might get a bit hard to manage or look a bit
silly when you have a large number of combatants in a fight.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>A while back I made a post about <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/05/27/masterful-combat.html">combining Weapon Master and Trained by a
Master</a> into a single advantage. After thinking about it for a while, I think
I might have changed my mind about it. I not sure the two traits are really
meant to coexist in the same campaign, despite what Dungeon Fantasy tries to do.</p>

<p>Dungeon Fantasy character creation rules are all about replicating a lot of
D&amp;D’s conventions in GURPS. And one of the D&amp;D-isms it tries to replicate is
that a combat centric character can be either strong or fast, but not both.</p>

<h2 id="dd-combat-conventions">D&amp;D Combat Conventions</h2>

<p>In recent editions of D&amp;D, that happens because characters have a very limited
number of points to distribute at creation, and every class is meant to have
only 1 or 2 attributes that are important to its abilities. Physical combatants
end up having either STR or DEX as their main attribute, and the rules are
usually set up so that the other member of the pair can be safely dumped.</p>

<p>STR-based combatants use the heaviest armor and weapons they can get. The vast
majority are melee specialists. Some buy a single thrown weapon at creation and
then promptly forget about it. All of these options are designed to make
Dexterity not matter to them.</p>

<p>DEX-based combatants are the opposite: they wear light or no armor, and are
evenly split between archers and melee skirmishers who rely on “finesse weapons”
that use DEX instead of STR. Therefore Strength doesn’t matter to them.</p>

<p>Every physical combatant<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in the last three editions of D&amp;D is going to lean
heavily towards one of these archetypes. A few classes incentivise players to
try and be a bit of both, but for most of them that’s going to lead to a weaker
character.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-gurps">What about GURPS?</h2>

<p>Dungeon Fantasy gives you templates to emulate the classes from recent D&amp;D, so
it ends up bringing this particular trope wholesale into GURPS. You have your
Strong Delvers, and your Fast Delvers<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. But we run into some issues because
GURPS is much less abstract than D&amp;D.</p>

<p>Both in real life and in GURPS, combatants want to be <em>both strong and
fast</em>. You need speed and precision to hit, and you need to put some force
behind your blows for them to be effective. Sure, an individual character might
have ST or DX that’s a bit higher than the other, but they’ll never be 10+
points apart like they are in their D&amp;D equivalents.</p>

<p>Still, DF tries, and Weapon Master is a significant component of this
attempt. It’s a mandatory trait for Swashbucklers, and an optional one for the
other fast delvers. It more or less takes the place of D&amp;D’s Weapon Finesse,
since it allows these characters to do improved melee damage without investing
many points into ST.</p>

<p>But it’s also an optional Knight trait. And it’s quite easy to take a starting
Knight and give them ST 18, Weapon Master (Dueling Halberd), and a starting
weapon skill of 20. Such a character literally combines the best of both
worlds. They can do all the same fancy tricks as the ST 11 Swashbuckler, and
their strikes to a massive amount of damage when they land, due to the higher
base number of damage dice and the per-die damage bonus.</p>

<p>As a player, this damage bonus seems so good to me that I’d feel bad about
“leaving it on the table” and not taking Weapon Master. As a GM, I worry that
any enemy that can withstand a hit from the Knight will be impervious to attacks
from the other PCs.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-about-it">What to do about it?</h2>

<p>The first option is of course to do nothing. This is admitedly a very niche
concern and you might be okay with it in your game. But if you are having Weapon
Master Problems at your table you might try one of these other possible
solutions.</p>

<h3 id="solution-1-flat-damage-bonus">Solution 1: Flat Damage Bonus</h3>

<p>A “minimally invasive” solution is to change the damage bonus from +1 or +2 <em>per
die</em> to a flat +1 or +2. All advantage costs remain the same, as do all
templates.</p>

<p>This means that the skinny swashbuckler who rolls a single die for damage still
gets the same bonus. Meanwhile Mister Halberd with his three dice of swing
damage gets a much smaller relative benefit.</p>

<h3 id="solution-2-no-more-weapon-master">Solution 2: No More Weapon Master!</h3>

<p>Weapon Master no longer exists and Trained By a Master comes in categories
similar to the removed advantage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>20 points makes you trained in One Weapon. This gives you improved parries,
improved Rapid Strikes, and access to the same limited set of Chi Skills as
Weapon Master did. No damage bonus, though!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>25 points gives you the same benefits for Two Related Weapons or all weapons
covered by One Skill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>30 points works as printed, giving you the full set of Trained By a Master
benefits for all muscle-powered weapons and unarmed attacks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>“All knives” counts as a single weapon for these purposes, like in the books. So
do “all unarmed attacks”.</p>

<p>Everyone who had Weapon Master as an optional advantage gets the corresponding
version of Trained by a Master instead, and has the option to upgrade to the
full version.</p>

<p>This is a more drastic and slightly more complicated solution. No one gets a
damage bonus any more, but no one overpays for the full Weapon Master package
either.</p>

</figure>

<p>Hell’s Rebels includes some traits in its Player’s Guide that can be assigned to
PCs to tie them to the campaign either by providing a motivation or by giving
them additional ways to contribute. A PC could be a minor worker in the opera,
or a fed-up citizen, or interested in the city’s history, and so on.</p>

<p>I don’t think those quite fit what I have in mind for my solo campaign. They are
suitable as backgrounds for level 1 starting characters and their mechanics can
be useful at the start, but pretty much cease to be a factor in the story once
the “main plot” kicks in.</p>

<p>Despite being released six years earlier than Hell’s Rebels, the <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/neverwinter/">Neverwinter
Campaign Setting</a> for D&amp;D 4e does a much better job at allowing players to
create characters who are <em>deeply</em> involved with the campaign at hand. More than
starting motivations, its character themes provide entire story arcs that will
remain relevant throughout the entire campaign.</p>

<p>I want the same thing for my game, so I’m going to replace the relatively
generic reasons given in the Hell’s Rebels player guide with something that’s
narratively on par with Neverwinter’s themes. I want them to not only be more
exciting, but also to reflect the increased starting power of Dungeon Fantasy
characters. They’re going to be key players in the rebellion from minute one of
the campaign. Why just be a random history buff when you can be The Last
Archivist instead? This status might be reflected in some of their traits, but
the story consequences are the main thing here.</p>

<p>Here are the “character themes” I intend to use. There are five, one for each of
my intended PCs, but presenting them separately will help provide some
inspiration to other GMs who want to do the same thing whether in GURPS or
another system. I’m using Dungeon Fantasy archetype and ancestry names instead
of those from Pathfinder, but the correlations should be pretty easy to
deduce. Each of them also has plot ties to some of the game’s possible allied
factions.</p>

<p>Each theme bellow includes a short background description, and paragraphs
listing prerequisites, benefits, and drawbacks. These are mostly story-related,
but they might also add optional mechanical traits to your character’s
template. You can buy these right away with your starting points, or buy them
later with earned points like any other template trait.</p>

<h2 id="the-sixth-raven">The Sixth Raven</h2>

<p>Most surviving historical documents about the Silver Ravens say they were five
in number: Jackdaw the elf swashbuckler, Amyreid the half-elf cleric, Ba the
halfling wizard, Kyda the human bard, and Brakisi the human scout.</p>

<p>These documents were wrong. There was one other: you.</p>

<p>You were a small orphan child then, adopted by the group as a kind of mascot
somewhere along their career. You shared their love for Kintargo and its
freedom, but you were too young to go on any actual adventures, so you mostly
helped by running small errands, and heard from their big battles when they
returned to tell the tale.</p>

<p>This lasted until the last battle, the one against the massed armies of House
Thrune. Jackdaw sent you away with many of her other non-combatant friends the
day before that one, promising she’d call you back when the danger was past. She
never did, because the Ravens lost. Jackdaw surrendered so that the demonic army
would spare the city, and the others were either killed by Thrune agents over in
subsequent years or disappeared forever.</p>

<p>Over the following decades you would finally reach adulthood and set out on your
own, becoming an adventurer of some skill and renown elsewhere in the Inner Sea
region. Now, you’re ready to return home and finish the work of your
old friends. Your name has been struck from the history books, but your passion
burns as brightly as it ever did.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: You must belong to a species long-lived enough that you could
have been a child 70 years ago and still be of adventuring age in the
present. Being a dwarf or some kind of elf is enough, but the Half-Spirit
ancestries from DF 3 might also fit. Another alternative is to play a
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/02/07/warforged-variants.html">Warforged</a> who was an <em>active</em> member of the Ravens and spent some of the
intervening decades disabled and unconscious, but was recently repaired. You can
belong to any profession.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You remember things. The GM might occasionally give you hints and
clues about old Silver Raven safehouses and stashes. You also knew the Ravens
personally and they knew you - should any of them still be around, you will be
able to recognize each other.</p>

<p>You can add the Serendipity {15} trait to your template if it’s not already
present. This represents your memories of old Kintargo and Raven hangouts, and
might let you find useful shortcuts, items, and passages that are not
pre-written into the campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Things remember you. Demons, vampires, and other similarly
long-lived monsters who faced the original Ravens back in the day will recognize
you just as readily, and will be extra-mean to you as a result. Once word
spreads that you’re back, some of them might even travel to Kintargo for the
sole purpose of killing you.</p>

<p>This can be represented by the Enemy (Monster of the Week, 9 or less) {-15}
trait, which gets added as an optional disadvantage to your template.</p>

<p>If you only have the DFRPG, the disadvantage works like this: the GM rolls 3d6
in secret at the beginning of each adventure or each session of an extended
adventure. If the result is a 9 or less, a significantly powerful monster will
appear somewhere along the coming adventure or session, inserting itself into
one of the upcoming situations and making things more complicated and dangerous
for you and your group. It’s usually something complicated to fight, and not
necessarily the same monster every time. This is <em>in addition</em> to any
pre-existing monsters in the adventure who recognize you and want you dead.</p>

<h2 id="the-last-archivist">The Last Archivist</h2>

<p>You were a member of the Sacred Order of Archivists, a secret society made up of
worshipers of various deities of knowledge and wisdom. The Order was dedicated
to preserving the true history of Kintargo and other such “forbidden” knowledge
from Thrune redactors.</p>

<p>The Order is no more: its hideout was raided and ransacked by Thrune forces
during the Night of Ashes. You were away when it happened, on a mission to
retrieve an important document in another city. That’s why you survived. When
you returned, you reached out to a few contacts and learned that some of your
colleagues have surviving family. They were nobles and their family estate was
razed during the Night of Ashes, but one of their sons is still at large. You
are now trying to find this son, help him stay safe, and then get revenge on
House Thrune.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: None! While the Order is an excellent origin for Clerics,
Wizards, and other big brains, it could easily have employed fightier or
sneakier types as security or retrieval specialists.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: It’s impossible to be a member of the Archivists and not learn
<em>something</em>. In addition to being familiar with the Order’s hideout and its
procedures, you also know a bit of the region’s unredacted history and a few
other tidbits of unrelated but potentially useful knowledge. You can recognize
the Sixth Raven if run into them.</p>

<p>You can add the History and Research skills as an option to your template, and
also all specialties of Hidden Lore if they aren’t there already. You also add
Wild Talent {20} as an optional advantage, representing a large trove of random
knowledge. If you’re using the Basic Set, add Intelligence Analysis to your
template as well.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: You’re riven by grief and driven by revenge against Barzilai
Thrune and his minions. This might manifest as Intolerance (Diabolists) {-5}, an
Obsession (depose Thrune)(12) {-10}, or both! The Obsession might seem redundant
since it’s also the overall campaign goal, but it also compels you to take
potentially risky and unwise courses of action if they seem like they will yield
quicker results. It could also prevent you from retreating from a fight against
Thrune’s minions.</p>

<h2 id="knight-of-the-deep">Knight of the Deep</h2>

<p>You come from one of the subaquatic communities off the coast of Ravounel, where
you enjoy an heroic reputation. You recently went to visit your friend Aava in
the coastal village of Acisazi, only to find her missing and the village
suffering under a strange malaise. The village’s elder told you Aava had led a
small party of scouts into Kintargo to ask seek help breaking the curse, but she
never reported back. She begged you to find Aava, and you accepted.</p>

<p>You arrive at this land-lubber town to find it embroiled in a lot more trouble
than you thought possible. Aava is nowhere to be found and neither is her
contact, the singer Shensen. You suspect both of them vanished into the prisons
of the despotic Barzilai Thrune, and your queries have led you to the Aria Park
protest. You suspect you might need to bloody this human despot’s nose to
fulfill your mission, and that’s just fine with you.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: You must belong to a species capable of breathing underwater!
Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level contains two possible choices here: the Sea
Elf and the Water-Infused. From this blog, you might also pick the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html">Argonian</a>
or perhaps a <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/02/07/warforged-variants.html">Warforged</a> who has been modified to be hydrodynamic and
Amphibious. And of course we also have a whole article about the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2024/04/28/atlantis.html">Denizens of
the Sea</a> that also contains a few usable ancestries.</p>

<p>This theme is open to any profession, but martial types should probably keep in
mind the rules for <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html">underwater combat for fish-people</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: The people of Acisazi know and trust you, and Aava is your good
friend (or even a relative if you’re also a sea elf).</p>

<p>You can add Swimming, Aquabatics and Survival (Undersea) to your template as
optional skills, and should probably put some points in them during character
creation.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Add Obsession (find Aava and her scouts) (12) {-5} to your
template as an optional disadvantage. It’s what you already want to do anyway,
but like the Last Archivist’s Obsession it might drive you to unwise actions.</p>

<h2 id="phantom-thief">Phantom Thief</h2>

<p>You are one of Lady Docur’s School for Girls’ most distinguished graduates. You
had parted ways with your alma mater and set up shop in nearby Vyre, but a
recent letter from Lady Docur herself brought you back to Kintargo. The city’s
political climate is getting rather inhospitable to the school, and she hopes
you will be able to help them survive these turbulent times.</p>

<p>In other words: the school is currently the closest thing Kintargo has to a
thieves’ guild. They specialize in training secret couriers and the nicer sort
of thief. Thrune prefers the <em>nasty</em> sort of thief, so things might get
difficult for the school and its students. That’s where you come in.</p>

<p>Of course, you’re not here just to help your old school. You’re also, er, taking
a breather from some rather complex entanglements you left behind in the good
city of Vyre. Hopefully it will be a long while before you have to set foot
there again.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: It’s a school for girls, which means you either are a woman
or only discovered you <em>weren’t</em> after graduation. You must also be some manner
of Thief, either the base template or one of the variants from the corresponding
Dungeon Fantasy Denizens book.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: You know Lady Docur and other characters associated with your alma
mater, and have their trust. You also know Vyre’s customs, which might come in
handy if you ever need to go back there.</p>

<p>Add Area Knowledge and Current Affairs for both Kintargo and Vyre to your
template, as well as Connoisseur, Savoir-Faire and the Fashion Sense
advantage. The School does give one a proper high society education.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Those Vyre entanglements will come back to haunt you if you ever
return there during the campaign.</p>

<p>No extra disadvantages here: everything which could make a thief’s life harder
is already part of the relevant templates.</p>

<h2 id="mysterious-satirist">Mysterious Satirist</h2>

<p>Even before Barzilai Thrune rolled in like he owned the place, you were already
well-known among Kintargo’s rebels, malcontents, and antifascists. Whether you
make poems, plays, essays, or songs, your work criticizing House Thrune was on
everybody’s minds and the pseudonym you chose for yourself was spoken in the
same tones as that of The Poison Pen and other such figures. Thrune’s opponents
speak it with admiration; his supporters, with disgust. That’s how you like it.</p>

<p>While no one has figured who you are yet, Barzilai’s arrival and the Night of
Ashes have made your life very difficult already. Most of your contacts among
Kintargo’s several resistance organizations have vanished, left town, or gone to
ground. While you still value your art, you also feel it’s time to engage in
more direct action against this dictator.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: None! While Bards obviously have a head start in terms of the
artistic skills implied by this theme, the Mysterious Satirist could be anyone.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: Choose one of the Bellflower Network, the Cult of Sarenrae, the
Rose of Kintargo, or the Poison Pen. You’re indirectly acquainted with that
group or individual. Though you have never met, you have corresponded and set up
pre-arranged signs that will let you recognize each other when the meeting does
happen.</p>

<p>Add the artistic or performance skills of your choice to your template, as well
as an appropriate Talent covering them to your optional advantages. Writing,
Poetry, and Musical Composition are appropriate if you share your work through
in written form. Public Speaking, Singing, Acting and Musical Instrument are
also good if you actually perform it. If you have the GURPS Basic Set, you can
also add Artist to the list of possible artistic skills, and you also add
Propaganda no matter what your medium is.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Add a 10-point Secret (Mysterious Satirist), Selfless, and
Trickster to your optional disadvantage list if they are not already there. The
first represents the risk of bad things happening when the authorities discover
who you are, above and beyond what being a Silver Raven would bring. The other
two represent possible reasons for you to have chosen this path in the first
place.</p>

</figure>

<p>It’s time for me to put on my GM hat and begin preparing my solo Hell’s Rebels
campaign. As mentioned in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/07/08/lets-play-hells-rebels.html">previous post</a>, I want to play this using the
GURPS Dungeon Fantasy rule set instead of the campaign’s native Pathfinder
1e. Let’s take a look at what this means.</p>

<p>But wait a minute! Wasn’t that previous most published more than a year ago?
Well, turns out I started writing this one shortly after publishing it, but one
thing and another got in the way and I’m only getting around to publishing it
now. I’m actually a fair bit along in campaign preparation and even started
playing, I’m just behind on documenting the process. Anyway, let’s keep going.</p>

<h2 id="the-setting">The Setting</h2>

<p>As we all know by now, Hell’s Rebels takes place in Golarion, Pathfinder’s
setting. Golarion was built from the ground up to support dungeon fantasy
campaigns so we don’t have any fundamental friction between it and the Dungeon
Fantasy rules. Despite the many D&amp;D-isms of Pathfinder’s first edition we
already know the setting can easily be used with other systems, since it has an
official Savage Worlds port and Paizo itself is in the process of removing those
D&amp;D-isms from the latest iteration of their house system.</p>

<p>That being said, I do want to make a few changes to the version I’m going to
use. The most obvious one is I’m going to drop the many different fiend
classifications from D&amp;D and Pathfinder in favor of Dungeon Fantasy’s
simplified “it’s all demons from Hell”. Any of the demons from DF will be fair
game as opposition here.</p>

<p>And since I’m talking about setting changes, any mention I find of Cheliax’s
fascists and diabolists being in any way “disciplined” or “organized” despite
their evil will be altered because incompetence, corruption, and a disregard for
any rules lies at the heart of fascism. These fucks do not make the trains run
on time and never have. You do not, at any point, gotta hand it to them.</p>

<p>I also want to lean on the similarities between this campaign and Assassin’s
Creed Brotherhood, so we’ll be at a Renaissance tech level with early guns
widely available to guards and rebels. Make ready your blessed bullets, o devil
hunters.</p>

<h2 id="the-mechanics">The Mechanics</h2>

<p>I think this will mostly be pretty simple, because this won’t be the first time
I’m converting between Pathfinder and DF. I did already run the first two
volumes of Hell’s Rebels and the first three volumes of Iron Gods to different
player groups. During those times two issues jumped at me as being the most
difficult to handle.</p>

<p>The first one was treasure conversions, but I think I’ve arrived at a satisfying
process for that <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/06/25/dungeon-fantasy-wealth.html">in this post</a>. Our delvers will eventually end up very
wealthy, but I imagine the rebellion will prove to be a great money sink.</p>

<p>The other difficulty concerns the only somewhat common part of the dungeon
delving experience that’s harder to do in Dungeon Fantasy than in D&amp;D:
underwater adventures. There’s a couple of extended underwater segments in the
middle of the adventure path, and Pathfinder’s default items and spells for it
are a lot more accessible than Dungeon Fantasy’s.</p>

<p>But hey, it turns out I already solved that too! <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html">This post</a> collects the
underwater rules I’ll be using, and <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/11/13/underwater-items.html">this one</a> has a nice set of more
accessible items to let our PCs go for a swim and live to tell the tale. The
truth is that I started writing this post before I wrote the underwater ones, so
they were actually part of my effort to figure this campaign out.</p>

<p>Monster conversions used to be a big problem back when I started the Let’s Read,
but now I have enough DF monster books that I can swipe appropriate stat blocks
for nearly every one of them. If I need to create new ones for specific foes,
you can be sure I’ll post them here.</p>

            <p>I’ve published an article about <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html">underwater adventuring</a> in the past, in
which I mentioned that “fish-people” had several advantages over “land-lubbers”
when it came to mobility and fighting in an underwater environment. A later post
included <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/11/13/underwater-items.html">a few items</a> that could help those land-lubbers close the
gap… so how about we take a look at those fish-people now? As a bonus, you get
a nice little bundle of setting info you can drop on your campaign if you want.</p>

<h2 id="the-fate-of-atlantis">The Fate of Atlantis</h2>

<p>The name “Atlantis” figures in the myths and legends of many more places than it
should. Cultures that have never heard of each other have stories about an
empire that ruled the waves in ancient times but no longer exists. The stories
might differ but the name is always the same.</p>

<p>That’s because ancient Atlantis was the largest and most powerful underwater
civilization to ever exist. They discovered a means of traveling to other worlds
and exploited it with gusto.</p>

<p>Despite its power Atlantis eventually fell, as all empires do. The exact
sequence of events is more or less impossible to piece together, and mostly
irrelevant in the present day. The important bit is that their inter-world
travel network was the first thing to go, instantly fragmenting the
empire. That’s why each of them has a different story about how Atlantis fell -
those stories talk only about the bits of it they knew about. In some, it
happened overnight due to a cataclysm. In others, they eventually morphed into
successor cultures that might still be extant in the present day.</p>

<p>Aside from giving rise to a whole bunch of legends and to fueling the occasional
would-be despot’s ambitions, the most enduring legacy of Atlantis was its
underwater engineering. They pioneered a lot of the techniques that used to make
sturdy weapons and tools out of implausible aquatic materials like bone, shell,
coral, and mother-of-pearl. They were also the first civilization to
successfully make and work orichalcum.</p>

<p>But we’re not here to talk about <em>stuff</em>, we’re here to talk about <em>people</em>.</p>

<h2 id="so-lets-talk-about-people">So Let’s Talk About People</h2>

<p>Opinions differ on whether Atlantis was a Golden Age utopia or a despotic empire
whose downfall was a blessing to the world, but everyone agrees it was pretty
diverse. Unlike most typical dungeon fantasy kingdoms, its citizens belonged to
many different species with none of them making up an overwhelming majority of
the population.</p>

<p>Many of Atlantis’ citizens can be described using already-published stats. Sea
Elves and Water-Infused from GURPS DF 3: The Next Level fit very well, as do the
Argonians from <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html">this post</a>. The octopus- and shark-folk from GURPS Banestorm
are also good fits, though they’re a bit more complex and costly than the
standard for DF racial templates.</p>

<p>Below are a few new templates, with the overall goal of allowing a diverse
all-underwater party if the group wants to play that type of campaign. A couple
of the new ancestries I present here might have equivalent official templates
already, but since I don’t have those I’m writing new ones for my own use.</p>

<p>These templates assume that being Amphibious also makes you able to see and hear
unimpeded while submerged, and the ability to breathe underwater also makes you
able to speak there. I feel this is in line with the simpler feel of Dungeon
Fantasy. If you want to follow Banestorm’s assumptions instead, give all
templates here one level of Nictitating Membrane {1} and Speak Underwater {5},
increasing their costs by 6 points each.</p>

<h3 id="atlantean-20-points">Atlantean (20 points)</h3>

<p>This template describes people who are a product of successive generations of
intermarriage between the other species that made up the population of Atlantis,
and possibly some surfacers too. They are known as “Atlanteans” because their
general look became associated with that empire. Surprisingly, they look a lot
like humans even when they have no humans among their ancestors.</p>

<p>Atlanteans are warm-blooded, have legs, and can breathe both water and
air. Their human-looking bits exhibit the same ethnic variety as
humans. Individuals can also have a variable number of “fishy” traits like
visible gills, fins, blue or gray skin, and so on. These might be visually
striking but are never significant enough to count as more than 0-point
features.</p>

<p>Atlanteans can appear in worlds that had an Atlantis, or those whose underwater
peoples are generally friendly with each other. The base stats could also be
used as they are or modified a bit to represent any species of underwater
humanoid.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Amphibious {10}, Gills {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Those fishy bits might count as varying levels of Unnatural
Features in a setting where almost everyone is human and the character is the
only known Atlantean, but in all other situations they’re 0-point traits. If the
character has something like rigid fins or a prominent tail growing out of their
lower back, they might need adapted body armor. This doesn’t cost extra, but
might restrict their usage of looted armor.</p>

<h3 id="crab-folk-40-points">Crab-Folk (40 points)</h3>

<p>Crab-folk are sapient humanoid crustaceans easily distinguished by their heavy
segmented carapaces. Like crabs, they lack distinct heads and their eyes are
located at the end of a pair of flexible, retractable stalks. Unlike crabs, they
only have the usual complement of humanoid limbs, though these are still
armored.</p>

<p>Crab-folk can operate normally on the surface, but their gills begin to dry out
if they go more than a day without being immersed in sea water. This means they
tend to stick close to the coast. Their voices sound strange and “bubbly”
outside the water, which most surfacers find off-putting.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: 360-degree Vision {25}; Amphibious {10}; Gills {10}; Damage
Resistance 5 (Cannot Wear Armor) {15}; No Neck {5};</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Cold-Blooded {-5}; Disturbing Voice (In Air, -50%) {-5},
Dependency (Sea water, Daily) {-15}.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Traits</strong>: If your campaign takes place far from a coastal area, the
Dependency disadvantage is worth -30 points, and the template therefore costs
only 25. Your local alchemist can prepare a solution close enough to seawater to
satisfy the requirement, but it’s still not free.</p>

<h3 id="deep-ones-50-points">Deep Ones (50 points)</h3>

<p>These humanoids are much more obviously “fishy” than Atlanteans, with an anatomy
closer to that of an abyssal fish than a human’s. They’re adapted to the
lightless depths of the ocean and that’s where they prefer to make their
homes. Deep Ones can swim up to the shallows without suffering ill effects, but
can’t breathe air.</p>

<p>After Atlantis fell, it was not uncommon for its Deep One settlements to become
more isolated and break contact with shallower or surface communities. This some
times gave rise to sinister legends and rumors about what they got up to down
there. These are mostly bunk: they are no more prone to worshiping Elder Things
than any other species.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Amphibious {10}, Dark Vision {25}, Fangs {2}, Gills {0},
Pressure Support 3 {15}, Tough Skin 1 {3}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Cold-Blooded {-5}.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Traits</strong>: A variant that can operate on the surface would be closer
to several classic D&amp;D fish-people. They have the 10-point version of Gills and
so cost that much more.</p>

<h3 id="merfolk-20-points">Merfolk (20 points)</h3>

<p>Merfolk are humanoid from the waist up and have fish bodies from the waist
down. They can breathe both air and water and have naturally melodious voices in
both mediums, but they require magic or assistive devices like wheelchairs to
operate on land. Their human halves display the same variance as Atlanteans, and
their fish halves can resemble a variety of species of fish, shark, or cetacean.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Gills {10}, Voice {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: No Legs (Aquatic) {0}.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>: The “Leg” and “Foot” hit locations on merfolk refer to their tail
and lower fins instead. Armor for those locations must be specially
constructed. As usual this doesn’t cost extra but limits which looted armor they
can use.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Traits</strong>: If your character’s fish half mimics a particularly speedy
species, they might have Enhanced Move 1 (Water) for an extra 20 points. At the
GM’s option, this might be a matter of training instead of biology, which means
any merfolk character can buy this with earned points as a power-up.</p>
