<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Athas only has one dragon: The Dragon of Tyr. He’s the setting’s main bad guy,
over and above the Sorcerer-Kings. As such, he’s immensely powerful,
intelligent, and evil. Prime Final Boss material!</p>

<p>However, you might not want to wait until your PCs are level 30 demigods before
they can fight a nasty giant lizard with elemental powers. That’s where Drakes
come in.</p>

<p>Athas has a lot of things that would be called drakes in standard 4e, but here
the name refers to something else entirely. The things Athasians call “Drakes”
are, essentially, nonsapient dragons. They fulfill many of a dragon’s narrative
functions. They’re big and tough enemies that make splendid boss fights for
high-Paragon or low-Epic parties. There are several types associated with
different elements. They lair in areas dominated by their associated element and
possess psychic powers that let them summon and control orbs of that element
from the Elemental Chaos. They even have a hoarding instinct!</p>

<p>The roles they <em>don’t</em> fulfill are those of being a Machiavellian plotter or a
big player in regional politics, which are things you’d expect a powerful enough
dragon to be. They’re animals, not people. A text box informs us drakes were
written this way because the Dark Sun setting is very geographically limited,
and has a relatively small number of movers-and-shakers who are all accounted
for. Adding an arbitrary number of traditional sapient epic dragons to this mix
would wreck the setting’s delicate equilibrium, and that’s a job for the PCs.</p>

<p>Another consequence of drakes not being sapient is that there’s no guarantee
their hoards will be <em>valuable</em>. There might be some good loot there, but it’s
going to be mixed with a mountain of trinkets and souvenirs that are merely
shiny or pretty.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>All drakes presented here are Huge Elemental Beasts with the Reptile tag, and a
tag corresponding to their associated element. They all have a <strong>Bite</strong> and a
<strong>Claw</strong> that act as basic attacks, and the signature <strong>Drake’s Fury</strong> power
that lets them spend a single action to use two Claws against one target and a
Bite against a different target.</p>

<p>Their elemental orb powers are area attacks that create a hazardous zone in the
affected area, but their exact powers vary with each stat block. They always
have a <strong>Bloodied Response</strong> reaction that lets them immediately rechage and use
an elemental power when first bloodied.</p>

<p>The same text box that discusses why drakes are nonsapient tells us we can take
any dragon from other books and add them as drakes in Athas by declaring them
nonsapient. Good candidates include brown, gray and red dragons from the
chromatics; adamantine, iron, and orium dragons from the metallics; and any of
the catastrophic dragons. You might want to change the appearance of the
metallics too, since their default coloration stands out too much.</p>

<h3 id="water-drake">Water Drake</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-drake-water.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Water drakes like to lair in oases. A possible sign of their presence is the
total <em>absence</em> of the small animals that usually live in such an
environment. If you find such a place, you should either keep moving or be very,
very sneaky when filling your waterskin.</p>

<p>This crocodile-looking beast is a Level 18 Solo Controller with 680 HP. It has
Resist 10 Cold, a ground speed of 8, and a swim speed of 12. It’s <strong>Aquatic</strong>,
meaning it can breathe underwater and gets +2 to attacks against non-aquatic
creatures in underwater combat.</p>

<p>The drake’s elemental attack is an <strong>Orb of Elemental Water</strong>,
which is a fireball-sized area attack (area 2 within 10, recharge 5+). It comes
in two versions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>boiling</strong> orb deals fire damage despite being made of water, and creates
a damaging zone that lasts for the rest of the encounter or until the drake
uses another boiling orb.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>ice</strong> orb deals no immediate damage, but inflicts ongoing 20 cold damage
and restrains (save ends both). It creates a zone that repeats the orb’s
attack against any creatures start their turn in the zone and are not
restrained. Again, this lasts until the end of the encounter or until the
drake uses another ice orb.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, this means the drake can have both a boiling and a frozen zone in place
simultaneously, though I’d rule they can’t overlap.</p>

<p>The drake’s other power is <strong>Psionic Clone</strong> (minor action, recharge 4+), which
lets it create a duplicate of itself on a solid or liquid adjacent space in the
map. The copy can acts independently and can take a full turn on an initiative
count 10 lower than the original’s. It has all the original’s stats and powers
with the following exceptions: it only has 1 HP; and it shares the original’s
recharge roll for its powers instead of having its own. If the original has any
spent powers when it uses this power, the copy’s powers will also start out
spent.</p>

<p>The water drake’s <strong>Bloodied Response</strong> recharges <em>both</em> the Orb and Psionic
Clone, letting the drake use both as a free action right then and
there. Double the orbs, double the fun.</p>

<h3 id="fire-drake">Fire Drake</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-drake-fire.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The flavor text here has a fire drake living inside an active volcano and
worshipped as a god by a halfling tribe, who try to sacrifice a human to it only
to be eaten along with the intended victim. Cliches aside, this shows us you can
find fire drakes in volcanos and other such places.</p>

<p>Fire drakes are Level 20 Elite Lurkers with 298 HP, a Speed of 9, and Resist 15
Fire.</p>

<p>The drake’s <strong>bite</strong> does standard damage for its level. The <strong>claw</strong> is a
little weaker but grabs on a hit. <strong>Drake’s Fury</strong> works as normal.</p>

<p>The creature’s <strong>Orb of Elemental Fire</strong> (recharge 5+) is an Area Burst 1 within
10 that deals fire damage and creates a damaging fire zone that lasts until the
end of the encounter or until the drake casts another orb. While it waits for
the power to recharge, it can use minor actions to move the existing magma zone
4 squares. The drake’s <strong>Bloodied Response</strong> recharges this orb and lets the
beast use it immediately.</p>

<p>The fire drake’s last power is not elemental: it’s <strong>Living Shield</strong>, an
opportunity action that lets the beast use a grabbed victim as a shield if
anyone other than that victim damages it. This makes the victim take half of the
attack’s damage, with the other half still affecting the drake.</p>

<p>There’s nothing terribly lurkery about the fire drake. With that grab and the
mobile zone, you could have made it a controller instead.</p>

<h3 id="air-drake">Air Drake</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-drake-air.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Air drakes live in tall mountains and canyons. They love to hunt animals and
people who try to walk the precarious passes of these places, knocking them down
with their wind powers and devouring the tenderized remains. They’re Level 22
Elite Skirmishers with 404 HP, a ground speed of 8, and a flight speed of 10.</p>

<p>These creatures deal extra damage when they have CA on an enemy, and this bonus
increases when they’re bloodied. Their physical attacks are otherwise pretty
standard for a drake.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Orb of Elemental Air</strong> has a wider radius than usual (area burst 3
within 10), and deals untyped damage on a hit. On a hit it also slides the
targets 5 squares, and creates the usual damaging zone. The zone cannot be
moved, but slides targets 3 squares when it damages them. This recharges when
the drake is first bloodied, but it has to be used during the drake’s actions
after this.</p>

<p>When pressured, the drake can use <strong>Wind Veil</strong> as a minor action (recharge
4+). This lets it shift its speed and gain concealment against non-adjacent
enemies until the end of its next turn. <strong>Bloodied Response</strong> recharges this,
and lets the creature use it immediately.</p>

<p>It felt odd for Bloodied Response to be such a defensive power here… but then
I saw that it’s because the drake can use <strong>Control the Wind</strong> as a reaction
when damaged. This is a Close Burst 5 vs. AC that deals the same damage as the
bite to the triggering enemy, and lets the monster slide the target 3
squares. Exceptionally, this slide can be <em>vertical</em>, which means the target
will take a bit of fall damage when it falls back to the ground… or a lot of
fall damage if tossed diagonally into a chasm. A merciful GM could probably
still allow the usual save vs. hazardous terrain to let the victim cling to an
edge before being tossed.</p>

<h3 id="earth-drake">Earth Drake</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-drake-earth.jpeg"/>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>A spicy bullette with earth control powers. Earth Drakes are Level 24 Elite
Controllers with 456 HP, a ground speed of 8, and a burrow speed of 6.</p>

<p>Their physical attaks work as usual. Their <strong>Orb of Elemental Earth</strong> is an Area
1 within 10 attack vs. Fortitude. It damages and restrains (save ends) on a hit,
deals half damage on a miss.</p>

<p>The resulting zone is difficult terrain, and the drake can use minor actions to
make secondary attacks against anyone inside. This deals a tiny bit of physical
damage and knocks the target prone. This is what <strong>Bloodied Response</strong>
recharges, but it’s not the only thing that happens when the earth drake is
bloodied.</p>

<p>You see, when that happens the drake <strong>Expands</strong>. It goes from Huge to
Gargantuan, pushing any targets that were adjacent to it out of its new occupied
space. While this lasts (until the end of the drake’s next turn), the drake’s
melee reach improves from 3 to 4, it gains +2 to AC, and anyone hit by its
attacks is immobilized.</p>

<p>When someone damages the drake it can use <strong>Immovable Stone</strong> as a reaction,
ignoring up to 4 squares of forced movement and using its bite against the
attacker.</p>

<h2 id="encounter-and-final-impressions">Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Since Athasian Drakes lack sapience, it’s harder to justify them being
accompanied by minions. However, all but the Water Drake are elites, which means
it’s very easy to set up an encounter against a mated pair of them. It might
also be possible to add elementals of an appropriate level to any drake
encounter as extra minions or regulars. The beasts wouldn’t be interested in
eating them.</p>

<p>Overall I like their mechanics. Taking one of these drakes and turning them into
a sapient dragon for outside of Dark Sun is as easy as taking a foreign dragon
and turning it into an Athasian Drake.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<p>Despite the title of their entry, these Dragonborn are <em>not</em> a new
addition. Dark Sun is one of two 2e settings (that I know of) that had draconic
humanoids in it since its initial publication.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Despite using dragonborn stats for the PC version, these are not the same
dragonborn as the ones from the standard Points of Light setting. Athasian
dragonborn are known as Dray, are lankier than the standard variety, and have a
completely different origin.</p>

<p>The Dray species was created by the sorcerer-king Dregoth to be his perfect
servants and minions, but he was dissatisfied with the result and cast most
of them out of his city-state of Giustenal. Those he allowed to stay kept
serving him until the other sorcerer-kings banded together to destroy Dregoth
and his city.</p>

<p>Today’s Dray are descended both from the outcasts and from the survivors of
Giustenal’s destruction. Their total population is relatively small and few
people know of their existence. Their communities are either small scattered
tribes in the wastes or the rare enclave embedded in a larger settlement.</p>

<p>Their reputation among those who know about them is as slavers and
sorcerers. Not All Dray (TM) deserve this reputation… but a significant
majority of them do. They practice defiling magic and slavery, and frequently
act as mercenaries for other groups who are okay with this. In this, they
continue the cycle of abuse, inflicting on others what their creator inflicted
on them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Dray, like standard dragonborn, are Medium Natural Humanoids with a Speed
of 6. They can use a <strong>Dragon Breath</strong> once per encounter, a Close Blast 3
vs. Reflex that deals some sort of elemental damage and whose details vary with
the stat block.</p>

<p>You can easily use standard dragonborn stat blocks from the other monster books
as more dray varieties if you need to.</p>

<h3 id="dragonborn-slaver">Dragonborn Slaver</h3>

<p>These assholes roam the desert looking for easily taken captives that they can
sell to the sorcerer-kings in exchange for money and prestige. They’re
frequently found in mixed-species slaver parties as their rank-and-file muscle.</p>

<p>Slavers are Level 16 Minion Soldiers that fight with <strong>Bastard Swords</strong> which
damage and mark for a turn on a hit. Their <strong>Dragon Breath</strong> deals lightning
damage and marks (save ends).</p>

<p>They’re tougher than your average minion too - the first time they drop to 0 HP,
their <strong>Determined Defender</strong> trait lets them recover, clear any effects on
them, and get back on at the start of their next turn. This makes them more
willing to risk harm when surrounding the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="dragonborn-scorned-champion">Dragonborn Scorned Champion</h3>

<p>A few dray take pride in being scorned by their creator, making that part of
their identity. I’m guessing these are the nicer ones, since it would make sense
for them to reject the ways of the sorcerer-kings. The Scorned Champion is an
example of someone who might rise to lead a community of these Dray. Still, he’s
sensitive to anything he perceives as a challenge to his position, and is quick
to strike down the source of that challenge.</p>

<p>The Scorned Champion is a Level 16 Skirmisher with 151 HP. This cocky fighter’s
<strong>Bravura Poise</strong> acts as an aura (1) that forces enemies inside to grant combat
advantage. He fights with a <strong>scimitar</strong> that damages the target and lets him
shift 1 square on a hit. The <strong>Dray Fury</strong> special attack (recharge 4+) lets him
shift his speed and strike twice with the scimitar at any point during this
movement. His <strong>DragonBreath</strong> can exclude one creature of his choice from the
blast, and deals fire-and-lightning damage. Finally, his <strong>Unstoppable Force</strong>
power lets him immediately end any Slow or Immobilize effect on him once per
round.</p>

<h3 id="dragonborn-defiler">Dragonborn Defiler</h3>

<p>Drays like this one go in the other direction - they look fondly upon the past
when they could walk the streets unchallenged, openly displaying their arcane
might. They want the power to do that again, and see defiling as the quickest
way to get there.</p>

<p>The Defiler is Level 18 Artillery with 129 HP. They use <strong>daggers</strong> as weapons
and implements, and the damage roll on this attack has a funky format that mixes
physical and cold damage. Their basic ranged attack is a <strong>Dragonfear Ray</strong>
(ranged 10 vs. Will) that deals psychic damage and causes the target to take 5
damage each time they damage the defiler or one of its allies, until the end of
the target’s next turn.</p>

<p>Their dragon breath has been corrupted into a <strong>Defiling Breath</strong> (close blast 5
vs. Reflex) that deals immediate and ongoing cold-and-necrotic damage (save
ends). While at least one target is taking this ongoing damage, the defiler has
+2 to all attacks and +5 to all damage rolls. This recharges if the defiler
misses every target with the power, so it will keep doing it until it hits
someone.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the defiler can cast <strong>Flight of Dragons</strong> as a move action,
allowing every ally within 5 squares to fly 5 squares, and flying 10 squares
itself. It doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it leaves its starting
square, but obeys the rules normally from that point on.</p>

<p>As a minor action it can also use <strong>Hurled Dragon Breath</strong> (recharge 5+) to do
just that with a less corrupt form of its breath. This is either a Close Blast 5
or an Area 2 Within 10, both targetting Reflex. It deals cold damage on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="dragonborn-atavist">Dragonborn Atavist</h3>

<p>Dray like this one prefer to focus on the bestial nature of their dragon
heritage, using ritual techniques to tap into that inner beast and bring it
forth during combat. Why use weapons when you have the power of a dragon at your
disposal? This one’s a Level 19 Brute with 220 HP and Resist 10 Acid.</p>

<p>Their basic attacks are a strong <strong>Bite</strong> and a slightly less strong <strong>claw</strong>,
both of which deal ongoing acid damage on a hit (save ends). <strong>Draconic Fury</strong>
(recharge 5+) lets them use both attacks with one action, or even engage in a
classic claw/claw/bite routine if they’re bloodied.</p>

<p>Their dragon breath, as you might expect, does acid damage.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>It seems the only stat block here that’s actively Evil is the Defiler - everyone
else is unaligned, even the slavers. I’m not sure I agree with that last part,
but I suppose you can use the slaver stat block for a more conventional non-evil
warrior.</p>

<p>I’m glad the game gives us some tools to stat up a non-evil group of Dray. PCs
have to come from somewhere, and it’d get a little samey if all of them were
nonconformist rebels fleeing their evil upbringing.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Dagorrans are carnivorous reptilian quadrupeds the size of large dogs. They can
track prey by its “psychic scent”, which they can memorize either through direct
contact or by stumbling into a creature’s psychic trail (i.e. through
psychometry). Once a dagorran has its chosen prey’s scent, they will chase it
relentlessly, across great distances, until they catch it.</p>

<p>In the wild, these creatures live in wide-ranging packs. Dagorran packs sleep
for a handful of hours every couple of days, and spend the rest of their time on
the hunt. They only stay at a single place for a while when they have to rear
their young, but as soon as the pups can run with the pack they’re on the move
again. Unlike some of the other magical beasts in the book, dagorran packs don’t
cooperate with other predators.</p>

<p>Young dagorrans are sometimes captured and trained by templars, who prize them
as peerless trackers and use them to track fugitives or wanted
dissidents. They’re much better at this job than cilopses, who must lay eyes on
the prey to start tracking and can only follow the trail for a short time.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Dagorrans share some similarities with baazrags (dog-like pack hunters) and with
cilopses (favored templar pets), but they’re a lot more dangerous with levels in
the mid-Paragon tier. They’re Natural Magical Beasts so we can consider them
sapient, though I guess their thought processes are pretty alien. The creatures
can understand Common, and they can communicate telepathically with other
dagorrans but not with anyone else.</p>

<p>They have a ground speed of 8, low-light vision, and the <strong>Psychic Scent</strong>
signature trait. This is a minor-action power that lets them choose a living
creature <em>or its tracks</em> within 10 squares of the dagorran. The dagorran can
ignore any level of concealment or invisibility on its chosen target, and knows
the creature’s location until it either dies or the dagorran uses the power
again. No wonder templars like them.</p>

<h3 id="dagorran-mindhound">Dagorran Mindhound</h3>

<p>These robust specimens charge in packs to surround and distract their chosen
prey, opening them up for attack by their sneakier relatives (below). They’re
Level 16 Brutes with 194 HP.</p>

<p>Their only attack is a <strong>bite</strong> that does respectable brute-tier damage, but
that and Psychic Scent are enough to make them a threat.</p>

<h3 id="dagorran-ambusher">Dagorran Ambusher</h3>

<p>These sneaky specimens move a bit ahead of the pack and position themselves for
an ambush, striking once their beefier relatives (above) begin their own part of
the attack. They’re Level 17 Lurkers with 132 HP.</p>

<p>Ambushers deal extra psychic damage against any creature that cannot see
it. This trait is somewhat confusingly named <strong>Combat Advantage</strong>. I mean, if
you cannot see the ambusher you will most likely be granting it CA, but if you
can see it you won’t take bonus damage even if you’re granting it CA for other
reasons.</p>

<p>That difference will soon cease to matter, however, because their <strong>bite</strong> makes
them invisble to the target for a turn on a hit. If they’re too far away to
bite, they can use their standard action to <strong>Fade to Nothingness</strong> and become
invisible either until they attack, or until the end of their next turn.</p>

<p>It’s a classical lurker setup, but the rider on their bite attack means that
they can keep biting you with bonus damage for as long as they keep hitting.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Dagorran encounters are simple. A wild pack is an all-dagorran encounter. You
can also find one or two of them as part of a Paragon-tier templar encounter.</p>

<p>Dagorrans feel a lot more “dog-like” than baazrags lore-wise, but not
mechanics-wise as they lack the ability to knock people prone or any Pack
Tactics style power. I think they work better as pets brought in by mixed
humanoid encounter groups, since those can be more varied than a wild pack. A
chase scene or skill challenge involving dagorrans is a much more drawn-out
affair than one involving cilopses, as the PCs will likely have to kill or
discourage the dagorrans before they can attempt to lose their pursuers.</p>

<p>I did find a bit surprising that they’re mid-Paragon monsters, but their stat
blocks are simple enough that you could reduce their level by 10 or so and still
have them work just fine as Heroic threats.</p>

<p>Crodlus are what Athas has instead of horses. Fans of Final Fantasy might
compare them do Darker and Sunnier chocobos.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In the wild, crodlus roam the wastes in small herds of about a dozen members,
led by a dominant female. Females make up most of the other members of the herd,
and are all related to the leader. One of the males will be the leader’s mate,
with the others being mostly younger individuals who have not yet reached
adulthood. When that happens, the newly adult males set out to seek mates in
other herds.</p>

<p>The creatures are omnivores, with herds cooperating to hunt those creatures they
judge to be weaker or smaller than themselves, and running away from stronger
predators. They’re also frequently beset by human raiders trying to capture
their young for training as mounts.</p>

<p>This means that crodlu are a common sight among groups of sapient
humanoids. They make for ornery mounts, but that’s a good trait to have in
something you want to ride into battle.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Crodlus are Large Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag and a ground speed of 8.</p>

<h3 id="crodlu">Crodlu</h3>

<p>This could represent a typical wild specimen, or perhaps a domesticated one that
wasn’t trained as a mount. It’s a Level 3 Brute with 55 HP.</p>

<p>The crodlu can attack with its <strong>beak</strong> or with <strong>claws</strong> that do a little less
damage. Whenever it can it will use a <strong>Pounce</strong>, which lets it move up to its
speed, and use both Beak and Claws against the same target even if it stands
still. If both attacks hit, the target falls prone.</p>

<h3 id="war-crodlu">War Crodlu</h3>

<p>This one was trained as a mount, and compares to the normal crodlu in the same
way a war horse compares to a draft animal. It’s a Level 5 Brute with 76 HP.</p>

<p>The War Crodlu has the same three abilities described for the normal version,
and one more: <strong>Pouncing Mount</strong>. If the war crodlu charges a target while
mounted, its rider can make a melee basic attack as a free action against that
same target. The Pounce ability does <em>not</em> count as a charge, but this makes the
charge of a mounted war crodlu a bit more dangerous than a standard Pounce,
depending on who the rider is.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Crodlus don’t strike me as the type of animal who’d attack wandering PCs without
provocation, so they’ll mostly likely be found serving as mounts for bad guys or
for the PCs themselves. Fighting wild ones would be something that happens when
the PCs decide to play hunter and steal hatchlings to sell or domesticate.</p>

<p>Mechanically they’re very simple, about on par with horses really. I’ve been too
desensitized by FF chocobos to see terror bird mounts as a mind-blowing
innovation, but they’re still kinda cool.</p>
