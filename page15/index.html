            <p>Woohoo, more dragons. The first Monster Manual (and the Vault) focused on
chromatic dragons, which are the classic draconic opponents, and now the second
one talks about the metallics.</p>

<p>The earliest metallic dragons were the Golds, who appeared alongside the
chromatic set in AD&amp;D 1st Edition and might have been around even earlier than
that. Here, we’re going to look at a slightly different set. This is an
introductory post, with the next handful of them each covering a different
“color” of dragon.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In editions past, metallic dragons used to be various shades of Good, something
which settings like Dragonlance really leaned into. Things are a bit more
complex here.</p>

<p>Metallics still venerate Bahamut in his role as the Platinum Dragon. They’re
more likely to interact peacefully with PCs and other sapients, but they can
still be quite full of themselves and are very protective of their territory and
treasure. If they perceive someone as a threat, they won’t hesitate to crush
that someone. And just like you can have friendly chromatics, you can also have
villainous metallics.</p>

<p>In either case they tend to have a scholarly temperament. They prefer lairs that
have some cultural or academic significance in addition to the usual
requirements of isolation and defensibility and their treasure hoards are
curated like museum collections. The typical metallic dragon loves engaging in
learned discourse, and has a keen ability to sense lies. They deal very harshly
with people who try to fool or, gods forbid, steal from them.</p>

<p>Like all dragons they see very few other creatures as their peers, but will
allow a group of “lessers” to gather around themselves. They tend to see these
as students and wards, instead of slaves and worshippers. A metallic dragon is
not going to set itself up as a god, but as a <em>university professor</em>.</p>

<p>This entry has five dragon types: Adamantine, Copper, Gold, Iron and
Silver. From what I gather, Adamantine and Iron dragons made it into the main
metallic lineup in 4e to replace bronze and brass dragons, which weren’t
distinct enough from Copper dragons at a glance. I think I agree with that
reasoning. While I’m sure these dragons have their own mechanical distinctions,
I sure can’t recall what they were just from looking at their names.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As usual for dragons, the ones we get here are all solos, and each has several
stat blocks representing different age categories: Young, Adult, Elder and
Ancient. Young dragons only have the most basic versions of their powers, and
both improve them and gain new ones as they age. Their mechanical design is
closer to that of the first Monster Manual than to the one from the Vault.</p>

<p>All dragons have darkvision, resistance to the same element they breathe, and
both combat and overland flight speeds. All of them get a different <strong>Breath
Weapon</strong>, as well as the <strong>Bloodied Breath</strong> trait and the <strong>Frightful
Presence</strong> attack.</p>

<p>Bloodied Breath works as usual: when the dragon is first bloodied, its breath
weapon recharges and it uses it immediately as a free action. Frightful Presence
is a Close Burst 10 vs. Will encounter power that does no damage but stuns for a
turn and has a -2 attack penalty (save ends) as an after-effect.</p>

<p>We’ll begin discussing the dragon types individually in the next few posts.</p>

<p>Djinns are inspired by the same real world Arabic folklore that inspired
efreets, and they’ve been in the game since at least BECMI.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Djinns are some of the most ancient sapient elementals, on par with efreets
(which we saw in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/11/efreet.html">first Monster Manual/Vault Let’s Read</a>). They’re
aspected to Air, and in the book’s own words, are “Ingenious Engineers of the
Fabulous”.</p>

<p>Back in the day, the djinn built entire civilizations in the Elemental
Chaos. Theirs were shining palaces filled with treasure beyond mortal
comprehension, and great gleaming cities built on mobile floating
platforms.</p>

<p>When the Dawn War came, the djinns chose to side with the primordials, which I
suppose they saw as the pragmatic choice. After all, their own empire was
outside the world, and the stronger primordials looked like they had a better
chance of winning. In the end, though, they chose wrong.</p>

<p>The gods scattered the djinns as punishment for their deeds in the war, and
imprisoned many of them in objects such as rings, lamps, or other artifacts. The
ones that remained free had their powers severely reduced. Over the ages a lot
of those artifacts and a lot of djinn relics made their way to other planes and
to the world.</p>

<p>So yeah, it’s totally possible for a PC to find the proverbial magic lamp. It’s
up to the GM whether the magic that binds the djinn inside forces it to serve
the bearer, though. If it does, then these relics are super-powerful! Even if
the djinn can’t grant wishes like in the stories, it’s still an epic-level
creature full of magic powers.</p>

<p>The djinns who remained free, and those who freed themselves over the ages,
mostly busy themselves with roaming the planes looking for the remains of their
ancient civilization, with the goal of rebuilding it. I would guess they had
some success in that, but that it’s still nowhere up to its former heights of
glory.</p>

<p>The djinns presented here are all Unaligned, which implies that as a people they
are mostly interested in picking up the pieces of their civilization than in
going a-conquering or enslaving others. They can still get into conflict with
PCs who (knowingly or not) keep those pieces from returning to their original
owners. Hold on to that lamp for too long and its inhabitant’s friends will show
up at your door with some very pointed questions. I can’t say they’d be wrong to
do so.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Djinns are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Air keyword. They have Blindsight
10, an immunity to disease and poison, Resist 15 Thunder, a ground speed of 6
and a flight speed of 8. The least intelligent djinn in this entry nas an Int of
19, so the ingenious engineers are also geniuses. Their level range covers the
early-to-mid Epic tier, making them only slightly weaker than efreets.</p>

<p>Most djinn powers have an air or storm theme, but they vary per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="djinn-thunderer">Djinn Thunderer</h3>

</figure>

<p>Thunderers are Level 20 Artillery with 146 HP and all djinn traits. They wield
jeweled scepters and strong air magic in combat.</p>

<p>The <strong>Scepter</strong> mostly acts as an implement, but can be used as a Reach 2 basic
melee attack in a pinch. Their main ranged attack is a <strong>Thunderburst</strong> (area
burst 2 within 20 vs. Fortitude), which does thunder damage and dazes for a
turn. Once per encounter they can use <strong>Imperious Thunder</strong>, which targets
Reflex and which has the same area and damage but instead of dazing causes 10
ongoing thunder damage (save ends) <em>even when it misses</em>.</p>

<p>The thunderer can avoid getting boxed in with <strong>Zephyr Step</strong> (minor; recharge
6), which allows it to teleport 20 squares. If it takes damage from a critical
hit, it will respond with <strong>Rage of Storms</strong> (close burst 2 vs. Reflex; free
action, encounter). This does high thunder damage, pushes hit targets 5 squares,
and gives the djinn 1 action point as an effect, which it can use normally later
on.</p>

<h3 id="djinn-windbow">Djinn Windbow</h3>

<figure class="left">

</figure>

<p>Windbows are Level 22 Skirmishers with 204 HP and all standard djinn
traits. They wield bows that fire arrows made out of wind, and this might lead
PCs to think they’re artillery. However, they’re equally good at melee and
ranged combat.</p>

<p>Their basic ranged attack is the <strong>Windbow</strong> (Ranged 10/20), and their basic
melee attack the <strong>Slash of Thunder</strong>. Both do about the same amount of damage,
which is thunder for the Slash and physical for the bow.</p>

<p>The djinn can cause one of their arrows to turn into a <strong>Brutal Zephyr</strong> (Ranged
30 vs. Reflex), which does thunder damage and is a bit stronger than the usual
attack. If this misses, the windbow gets to choose a different target within 10
squares of the original one and re-roll the attack against them.</p>

<p>If damaged by a critical hit they can use <strong>Blowback</strong>, which works exactly like
the Thunderer’s Rage of Storms.</p>

<p>Stormswords fight with scimitars and train to form whirlwinds that pull enemies
towards their blades. They’re Level 24 Soldiers with 222 HP and all standard
djinn traits, plus Resist 15 Lightning.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Scimitars</strong> are Reach 2, high-crit weapons that mark for a turn on a
hit. Their printed critical damage is 9d10+33, and it would be even higher with
a math fix. They can also use a technique named <strong>Whirlwind Dervish</strong> (close burst 2
vs. AC; encounter) which does heavy thunder and lightning damage and recharges
when they’re critically hit.</p>

<p>Stormswords can drag targets into range with <strong>Come To Me</strong> (Ranged 5
vs. Fortitude; minor action), which does no damage but pulls the targets 5
squares. They can sometimes intensify that into a <strong>Spinning Vortex</strong> (Ranged 5
vs. Reflex; recharge 6), which does heavy cold and thunder damage, and
immobilizes (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="djinn-skylord">Djinn Skylord</h3>

<figure class="left">

  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Skylords are djinn spell-casters, specializing in sky- and weather-themed
magic. They’re Level 25 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 236 HP along
with all standard djinn traits.</p>

<p>Their main weapon/implement is the <strong>Storm Staff</strong> (reach 2 vs. AC), which does
physical damage and allows the djinn to shift 2 squares or make an extra
recharge roll for <strong>Storm Shout</strong>. This, in turn, is a Close Blast 5 vs. Will
that does heavy thunder damage, pushes 3 squares, and knocks prone. It recharges
on a 5-6.</p>

<p>The skylord’s main ranged attack is <strong>Mystic Hail</strong> (ranged 20 vs. Will), which
does psychic damage and makes the target grant combat advantage to the
djinn. This lasts until the target spends a standard action clearing their head,
which is a heavier cost than having to roll a save. This works as a nice setup
for <strong>Sandstorm</strong> (Close Burst 5 vs. Will), which does heavy physical damage and
creates a zone. Allies inside the zone gain concealment, and enemies starting
their turns inside are dazed for a turn. This can be sustained with a minor
action. And finally, the djinn can also use a minor action (1/round) to use
<strong>Elemental Command</strong> (ranged 10), which always hits, does no damage, and slides
the target 1 square.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Djinns are said to mostly hang out with their own kind, and the two sample
encounters (level 22 and 26) bear this out. They’re assorted djinn parties,
likely journeying after relics of their old empire. The first one has a couple
of rimefire griffon pets, the second has 2 storm gorgons.</p>

<p>Djinns are cool, and I like that they’re presented as not necessarily
hostile. Unlike in previous edition they’re not in an eternal war against the
efreets, though I imagine they don’t often have friendly interactions all that
often either. It might also be interesting to take a page from Middle Eastern
folklore here and say that many djinn in the present are devout worshippers of
the gods.</p>

<p>I had never heard of direguards before, but some quick googling tells me they
first appeared in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting for AD&amp;D 2nd Edition.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A direguard is a skeletal undead created by a specific ritual often known by
liches and death knights. The ritual requires willing subjects, who retain their
minds, combat skills, and powers. This comes at a price, however: in the book’s
own words, they must “meet a quota of killing”, or they’ll be destroyed. I don’t
know if this is a one time thing or if it’s more like “kill X people every
month”. And of course they’re bound to the will of their creator.</p>

<p>Their FR lore is all tangled up with the whole Bane/Cyric situation.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Direguards are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead keyword. They have
darkvision and truesight 10, and are immune to disease and poison. The rest of
their traits varies per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="direguard-deathbringer">Direguard Deathbringer</h3>

<p>Deathbringers are Level 8 Elite Artillery with the Leader keyword and 134
HP. They have a ground speed of 7 and project a <strong>Command Aura</strong> (4) that grants
a +2 attack bonus to all allies inside. They can also issue a <strong>Vile Command</strong>
(close blast 3; recharge 5-6) that allows all affected allies to shift 2 squares
and make a basic attack as a free action.</p>

<p>They fire <strong>Force Blasts</strong> (Ranged 15 vs. Reflex) that do force damage and push
the target 3 squares. On a miss, they do no damage but slow the target for a
turn. <strong>Frightful Force</strong> (recharge 4-6) allows them to fire three such blasts
against different targets in a single action.</p>

<p>If forced into melee, the deathbringer’s <strong>Blazing Bone Claws</strong> do force damage
as well. And when they’re first bloodied, they summon some <strong>Force Armor</strong>
around themselves that grants a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex until they’re hit by
an attack.</p>

<p>I’d say deathbringers are at home just behind the front line, or further back
along with a cluster of artillery enemies with ranged basic attacks.</p>

<h3 id="direguard-assassin">Direguard Assassin</h3>

<p>Assassins are Level 11 Skirmishers with 111 HP. They’re made of shadow as much
as they are made of bone, and fight with swords made of force magic. Their
ground speed is 8.</p>

<p>That <strong>Force Blade</strong> deals force damage, as expected, and once per encounter
they can fling <strong>Dire Blades</strong> to do the same amount of damage in a Close
Burst 1. <strong>Mobile Assault</strong> gives them a +2 attack bonus if they move at least 4
squares before attacking, and <strong>Mist Walk</strong> allows them to shift 2 squares and
gain Insubstantial and Phasing for a turn when missed by a melee attack.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There are no sample encounters here! I guess they could only spare one page for
direguards, so there was no room.</p>

<p>I don’t care for the FR bits of their lore, but Deathbringers work nicely as
commanders of mindless undead, and Assassins are good elite troops for someone
like a skull lord to order around.</p>

<p>Dimensional marauders are a 3.x creation. I definitely remember that image,
though I don’t remember if they had a different name back then. It was probably
something like “Ethereal Marauder”, but 4e doesn’t have an ethereal plane
anymore.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These creatures are plane-hopping predators who travel the planes and the world
in search of easy prey. And that’s all the book has to say about them.</p>

<p>Let’s allow ourselves to speculate a bit. Dimensional marauders “travel the
planes”, and I guess that means they don’t have a fixed territory and follow
sources of food instead. If you look at their stat block you’ll see their level
is a lot lower than that of almost any creature they’re likely to find in the
planes. This means they’re <em>opportunistic</em>, looking for creatures that have
already been weakened by some other hazard or who are busy fighting someone
else. Then they jump in and take a bite. If the meal is still kicking, they
might run away, otherwise they stay and finish it off.</p>

<p>Evolutionary pressure has given then a rudimentary sapience, which aids them in
evaluating the strength of potential prey. It also often leads marauders to the
conclusion that the easiest prey can be found in the world, near population
centers filled with juicy non-combatants whom they might even be able to beat in
a fair fight. Not that they’ll fight fair.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Dimensional Marauders are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts, and Level 4 Lurkers
with 45 HP. They have low-light vision, a ground speed of 7 and a teleport speed
of 3.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> with that cool triangular jaw. They can also
use their standard action to assume a <strong>Planephase Form</strong>, partially shifting to
some other plane. This gives them the Insubstantial and Phasing qualities for a
turn, or until they miss with an attack. They can also sustain this with a minor
action, but it ends immediately when they take psychic damage.</p>

<p>While in this state, the marauder can use a <strong>Reality Warp</strong> attack (melee 1
vs. Reflex), which does light physical damage, teleports the target 3 squares,
and teleports the marauder itself to a square adjacent to the target. It will
use this to isolate its chosen victim.</p>

<p>If the marauder is hit by a melee attack, it can use <strong>Planar Evasion</strong>
(recharge 4-6) as a reaction, teleporting 3 squares.</p>

<p>I see them mostly staying in planephase form and using Reality Warp to isolate a
PC, which they’ll begin biting for more damage once they’re far away. The book
tactics start them out entirely physical and has them planephase after hit for
the first time in combat, but there’s no reason for them not to planephase
before the fight even starts.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Sometimes, a group of sapients will convince a marauder to work with
them. Mostly, though, they just opportunistically jump into ongoing fights to
take a bite out of whoever seems weakest.</p>

<p>The sample encounter could represent either of these situations. It’s level 3,
with 2 marauders, 2 ettercap fang guards, and 1 gnome arcanist.</p>

<p>I think the illustration is very cool and memorable, but I only found the
creature itself interesting because of all the aprocryphal lore I came up with
in this post. Mechanically, I almost think it would work better as a Controller,
since its abilities are more about knocking PCs out of position than dealing
increased damage. If you give it some bonus sneak attack damage, it does work as

<h2 id="infernal-armor-animus">Infernal Armor Animus</h2>

<p>We’ve talked a lot about devils always trying to acquire souls by hook or by
crook, but what do they use them <em>for</em>? Here we have a concrete example of one
of the many products in Hell’s catalogs.</p>

<p>These monsters are made by binding the soul of a mortal within a suit of
infernal armor, which is animated by the process. The animated armor has its own
mind - the soul is just the power source. The animus understands Common and
Supernal, and at Int 8 it’s smart enough to understand the orders of its
infernal masters. When it’s destroyed in combat, it releases the trapped soul,
which will usually be consumed by a nearby devil for a quick performance boost.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Animi are Medium Elemental Animates with the Devil and Undead keywords - the
only non-humanoid devils in the MM2. They’re also Level 3 Minion Soldiers, which
means they appear in the “bargain bin” section of the catalog and will be found
fairly early in a zero-to-hero campaign with devils as the main
antagonists. They have darkvision, Resist Fire 5, and a ground speed of 6.</p>

<p>These things project a <strong>Bloodlust</strong> aura (2) that gives nonminion devils within
a +1 to damage rolls. Multiple auras are cumulative, so I imagine animi keep a
tight formation around their boss.</p>

<p>They wield shields and shortswords in combat, and the <strong>sword</strong> attack is
nothing special. When they’re destroyed, <strong>Essence Transference</strong> triggers and
heals the nearest non-minion devil within 15 squares for 15 HP.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounter-and-impressions">Sample Encounter and Impressions</h3>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 5: 8 animi, 2 spined devils, 1 tiefling heretic.</p>

<p>Look at that healing value for Essence Transference! This tells me infernal
animi aren’t used as dumb muscle - that’s the job of legion devils. Instead
they’re ambulatory <em>snacks</em> just waiting for the PCs to unwrap them and feed
them to their master. They might be able to get a hit or two in before that
happens, but that’s just a bonus. Kill them before damaging their masters.</p>

<h2 id="misfortune-devil">Misfortune Devil</h2>

<p>Valued members of the acquisitions department, misfortune devils collect souls
by tempting mortals into taking ever-larger risks, which ultimately culminate in
the mortal dying and the devil owning their soul. It helps that they know a lot
of probability-warping magic to speed the process along.</p>

<p>I imagine that there are many strategically-placed tomes out in the world that
teach a ritual to summon one of these and describe it as a “wise advisor” who
will always have the summoner’s best interest at heart. Satisfaction guaranteed
(and never mind the fine print)!</p>

<p>Misfortune devils can also choose prospective victims on their own inititive. If
the victim in question is someone who knows better than to listen to a devil,
they can use innocuous-looking underlings to make contact, or disguise
themselves with magic rituals. And finally, they can also be attached as support
spellcasters to a unit of devils out on some mission of a more military nature.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>These Medium devils are Level 15 Artillery with 115 HP. They have darkvision and
truesight 10, ground and fly speeds of 6, and interestingly enough no elemental
resistances.</p>

<p>They attack at range with a <strong>Ray of Distortion</strong> (ranged 20 vs. Reflex), which
does high physical damage - unusual for an at-will attack. The catch is that the
target of this attack can choose to take only 5 damage instead, and have the
original damage re-rolled and applied to their ally with the most HP. How
close-knit is your party, really?</p>

<p>If an enemy manages to get close, they can fight back with a <strong>Lucky Maneuver</strong>
(melee 1 vs. Will; basic) that does light psychic damage and allows the
misfortune devil to teleport 4 squares. If someone does manage to hit them with
a melee or ranged attack, they ran react with <strong>Roll the Bones</strong> (interrupt;
encounter) to have the attack target another creature of their choice that’s
within 5 squares.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounter-and-impressions-1">Sample Encounter and Impressions</h3>

<p>The sample encounter is one of those “attached to a unit” situations: Level 13,
2 erinyes, 5 legion devils, and 2 misfortune devils. Almost identical to the one
listed for erinyes, only it’s misfortune instead of chain devils following
along.</p>

<p>These creatures are surprisingly fun, and might cause some intra-party friction
among the PCs. With the interrupt ability it’s clear that it’s the misfortune
devil causing a friendly fire incident, but the Ray of Distortion requires a
conscious decision by the first target to work its special magic. Do you want to
betray your beefy friend in order to avoid pain? C’mon, do it! What’s the worst
thing that could happen?</p>

<h2 id="shocktroop-devil">Shocktroop Devil</h2>

<figure class="right">

<p>For when a phalanx of bearded devils just isn’t shock-troop enough for the
job. These Large winged devils perform a function a lot like that of mortal
cavalry: units of them charge into enemy lines to break up tough formations,
cause havoc, and slay as many as they can.</p>

<p>Shocktroop devils fly really fast and can’t be dismounted since they don’t
<em>have</em> mounts, but much like mortal cavalry they can end up losing momentum if
they stay mired in the melee for too long. If that happens they’ll attempt to
retreat, and will be back to fight once they’ve recovered.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-2">The Numbers</h3>

<p>These are Level 16 Soldiers with 155 HP. They have darkvision, a ground speed of
6, and a fly speed of 8. They lack any elemental resistances, which I think must
be an error of some sort. I’d expect them to have 15 or 20 fire resistance. They
wear plate and wield a sword and shield.</p>

<p>In any case, they’re protected by <strong>Asmodeus’s Shield</strong>, a passive trait that
gives them +2 to all defenses against divine powers while they’re unbloodied,
and a -2 penalty to the same while bloodied. “Divine powers” means anything
that’s not a basic weapon attack from any of the classes with the divine power
source: clerics, paladins, avengers, invokers… I’d say it also covers any
attacks by angels and the like.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>sword and shield</strong> combination which, as a basic
attack, can be used in a charge. It deals physical damage and triggers a
secondary attack vs. Fortitude. A hit on that one pushes the target 2 squares
and dazes them for a turn.</p>

<p>Once in the fray, they can increase their rythm and perform a <strong>Shocktroop
Attack</strong>, which allows them to make three Sword and Shield attacks in a single
action, each against a different target. This encounter power recharges whenever
the shocktroop devil has full HP, which means they can use this every turn until
they’re damaged.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounter-and-impressions-2">Sample Encounter and Impressions</h3>

<p>The sample encounter is level 16: 1 bone devil, 1 misfortune devil, and 3
shocktroop devils. A command squad of sorts.</p>

<p>I’ll admit, the basic concept behind shocktroop devils seemed so bland when I
first read through this book that I never took a good look at its stat block
until now. It turns out they can be a lot of fun, and the designers managed to
really capture that “cavalry” feeling with them.</p>

<p>The recharge condition on Shocktroop Attack means these monsters are more
dangerous when deployed in groups as part of an encounter. The natural instinct
of 4e players to focus-fire on a single monster at a time will work against them
here, because it might keep the shocktroops they ignore at full HP for longer,
allowing them to attack lots and lots and lots of times.</p>

<p>For extra Fun(TM), add a unit of leveled-up Infernal Armor Animi to your
shock-troop devil vanguard.</p>

<h2 id="withering-devil">Withering Devil</h2>

<figure class="left">

<p>Like Misfortune Devils, Withering Devils are soul collectors and members of the
acquisitions department. However, they use a different strategy: their powers
bend mortal minds towards apathy and depression, eroding their ability to care
for their fellow sapients or for much of anything else.</p>

<p>In combat this translates into spells that slow enemies down and make them less
effective, but these fiends are much more dangerous on a narrative scale. They
can cause entire societies to succumb to plague, famine, and strife by
targetting the people whose job was to prevent this and turning them into
lazy shadows of their former selves. “Just open the economy up already, fighting
this plague is too hard, I’m sure everything will work out”.</p>

<p>Though their natural appearance is horrible, they are adept at disguising
themselves as mortals, either with magic or with heavy cloaks in dark rooms.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-3">The Numbers</h3>

<p>These Medium devils are Level 14 Controllers with 138 HP. They have Darkvision,
Resist Fire 15, and a ground speed of 6. The illustration gives them wings but
they don’t fly, presumably because it’s too much of a bother.</p>

<p>Withering devils project an <strong>Aura of Weariness</strong> (3) that weakens all enemies
inside. Their basic melee attack is with the <strong>Staff of Weariness</strong>, which has
no funky riders despite the awesome name. At range they shoot <strong>Draining Rays</strong>
(ranged 20 vs. Reflex) that do psychic damage and immobilize for a turn. As a
minor action they can use a <strong>Gaze of Apathy</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will; recharge
5-6) which does no damage but slows (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounters-and-impressions">Sample Encounters and Impressions</h3>

<p>Wow, I bet these things are really annoying to fight if positioned just behind a
line of beefy front-liners so that their weakness aura affects the PCs.</p>

<p>The sample encounters do just that, either using bearded and legion devils as
the front-line, or attaching the devil to a mixed-party of yuan-ti.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That’s it for the devils in this book, but we’re not out of the D’s yet.</p>
