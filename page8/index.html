<p>This one feels like an AD&amp;D 2nd Edition creation, as that’s when they renamed
demons as “ta’nari”.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Tannarukk are engineered hybrids of orc and demon DNA, the product of rituals
performed by demon lords or ambitious mortal spellcasters. These rituals are
effectively a mass-production process, as they involve pulsing vats and can
create dozens of the creatures at once. In most cases they’re immediately put to
work as soldiers and weapons of war, though they’re extremely difficult to keep
under control unless they get “enough” opportunity to commit violence. As you
might expect, that’s a tall order.</p>

<p>The few free tannarukk bands that exist tend to seek work as mercenaries. Free or
not, they can most often be found in the Astral Sea or Elemental Chaos, usually
fighting something. They do sometimes show up in the middle world, and they love
it because few warriors there can match their skill and resilience in combat.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Tannarukks are Medium Elemental Humanoids with the Demon and Orc keywords. They
have Darkvision and Speed 6, along with Resist Fire 5. Their signature trait is
<strong>Indomitable Fury</strong>, which kicks in when they drop to 0 HP for the first time
in the fight. It makes them stay at 1 HP instead and gives them +2 to attacks
and +4 to damage until the end of the encounter.</p>

<p>This means the PCs should make sure each Tannarukk in the encounter stays down by
hitting it again before it can get a chance to take more actions. If they don’t,
they’re going to take more damage; if they do, that’s one attack that didn’t go
to a healthier monster.</p>

<h3 id="tannarukk-marauder">Tannarukk Marauder</h3>

<p>Most tannarukks conform to this stat block, which is your basic enthusiastic axe
murderer. Marauders wear hide and wield a <strong>greataxe</strong>, and can also thrown
<strong>handaxes</strong> at those they can’t quite reach.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Nimble Reaction</strong> trait gives them +4 AC against opportunity attacks,
which is good because their signature move relies on fishing for them: <strong>Brutal
Rampage</strong> allows them to move their speed and make a greataxe attack at any
point during the move. This attack gains a +5 damage bonus for each opportunity
attack made against the marauder during the move (but before the attack). The
opportunity attacks don’t need to hit, they just need to happen.</p>

<h3 id="tannarukk-steel-warrior">Tannarukk Steel Warrior</h3>

<p>This is a bigger tannarukk that received better training and had armor riveted to
its hide. It’s a Level 18 Soldier with 177 HP. Its armor counts as plate, and it
wields a shield and a <strong>Longsword</strong>, plus a <strong>Crossbow</strong> for ranged attacks.</p>

<p>The sword marks for a turn, and the warrior can make free attacks against
enemies that ignore the mark. It can also be used in a special attack named
<strong>Burning Cage</strong> (recharge 5+). This melee attack targets Reflex and does heavy
fire damage. The target takes a further 5 fire damage every time it enters a
square during its turn (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="tannarukk-flame-speaker">Tannarukk Flame Speaker</h3>

<p>This is a tannarukk spellcaster whose power relies on a connection to the abyssal
flames that go into their production ritual. It’s level 17 Artillery with 129
HP and resist 10 fire, a bit higher than usual for them.</p>

<p>The flame speaker fights with a <strong>Staff</strong> in melee, and with <strong>fire bolts</strong> at
range. It can also shoot a <strong>fire barrage</strong> (recharge 5+) that targets up to
three creatures but does a bit less damage than the basic bolt.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, the flame speaker can summon <strong>Winds of Fire</strong>, an area
burst attack that deals fire damage and creates a zone that lasts for the rest
of the encounter. Anyone starting their turn inside takes 10 fire damage and is
pulled 1 square towards the zone’s origin square.</p>

<p>In addition to Indomitable Fury, the flame speaker also has <strong>Avenging Fire</strong>,
which triggers when it hits 0 HP for the second time. It deals some automatic
fire damage to the triggering enemy.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These stat blocks take up a lot of space on the book, but they’re simpler than
they look. Each one has a solid gimmick and appropriate base stats. I guess
tannarukks are meant to be regular enemies for upper paragon PCs - stronger than
minions, but you’ll still meet a lot of them.</p>

<p>Lore-wise, I’m not sure I like them. They’re more or less D&amp;D’s take on the
Uruk-Hai, I guess, but there are a lot more opponents at this level range that
feel cooler and less potentially problematic.</p>

<p>Su Monsters have been around at least since the AD&amp;D Monster Manual. This is
their 4e debut. It’s likely their lore is new to this edition. They didn’t seem
to have any in the AD&amp;D book.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Su Monsters are an artificial species created by the wizard Halkith to guard his
tower in the legendary Isle of Dread. In Fourth Edition, the Isle is a wandering
island in the Feywild, and as usual it’s full of very dangerous
creatures. Halkith created the first Su Monsters to guard his tower against the
place’s other inhabitants.</p>

<p>Some time after that, a mysterious event caused a worldwide surge of psionic
energy. This affected Halkith’s su monsters deeply and caused them to break from
the wizard’s control. Halkith disappears from history after this - his most
likely fate is that he was eaten by his creations.</p>

<p>The wizard combined traits from both great apes and fey panthers to make these
creatures. In our narrative present they managed to spread beyond the Isle of
Dread. Their preferred habitat are tropical jungles, particularly those that
contain sources of psionic power.</p>

<p>Su Monsters are nonsapient but cunning, and complement their natural weapons
with residual psychic powers received from the Event. Like cats, they hunt as
much for fun as for food, and kill much more prey than they can eat at
once. They bury the excess meat for later consumption, and mark these stashes
with the prey’s inedible bits (such as its carried treasure). If you find
shinies hanging off tree branches in the jungle, take care!</p>

<p>Spellcasters and psionicists often use their power to control these creatures,
putting them to work as guard and attack animals. When free, they protect and
hunt in their chosen territories with surprisingly sophisticated tactics.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Su Monsters are Medium Fey Beasts with ground and climb speeds of 7, as well as
the Forest Walk special ability. They have darkvision, and one of both of the
following signature abilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Psychic Boost</strong> works like the Star Spawn ability we saw: when a su monster
hits with one of its physical attacks, it can deal bonus psychic damage as a
free action. This recharges when the creature takes psychic damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Tribal Fury</strong> has a very unfortunate name and allows the monster to make a
free claw attack when an ally within 3 squares is first bloodied.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="su-sentinel">Su Sentinel</h3>

<p>Many members of a su monster group use this stat block. Each one keeps watch
over a portion of the group’s territory, and calls the others if they spot any
prey.</p>

<p>Su Sentinels are Level 10 Skirmishers with 107 HP. They have a <strong>Skirmish</strong>
trait that allows them to deal 5 extra damage with their attacks if they moved
4 or more spaces this turn.</p>

<p>In addition to basic <strong>Claw</strong> strikes, they can make a <strong>Flashing Talons</strong>
maneuver that deals a bit less damage and, as an effect, allows them to shift 2
squares. If the targeted enemy moves to a space adjacent to the monster during
their next turn, the creature gets to make this attack against them once more
for free.</p>

<p>They can also use a <strong>Mind-Rending Bite</strong> (recharge 4+), which deals even less
basic damage but inflicts ongoing 10 psychic damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Sentinels have both Su Monster signature abilities.</p>

<h3 id="su-ambusher">Su Ambusher</h3>

<p>Su Ambushers are less physicall imposing but they hunt together, hanging out
near places that see frequent creature traffic and jumping out all at once to
carry prey away. They’re Level 11 Minion Soldiers.</p>

<p>They have a basic <strong>Claw</strong> attack that does minion-tier damage, but instead of
using that they’re going to rely on <strong>Seize Prey</strong>. This lets them move their
speed and make a claw attack at any point along the move. If they hit, they pull
the target alongside them the rest of the move, and do not provoke opportunity
attacks from it. This is excellent for getting defenders out of the way or
briging squishies closer to danger.</p>

<p>Ambushers have Fury, but they replace Psychic Boost with <strong>Grasping Claws</strong>,
which allow them to make one last claw attack when they hit 0 HP.</p>

<h3 id="su-alpha">Su Alpha</h3>

<p>Su Alphas are larger and more powerful specimens who gained some status within
their group by repeatedly proving they can beat up their puny relatives. Smaller
groups have only one alpha, but larger ones might have several. They are Level
12 Brutes with 149 HP.</p>

<p>Alphas fight with <strong>Claws</strong> and <strong>Backhand Slams</strong>, the latter of which do less
damage but target Fortitude and push the target 1 square. They can also emit a
<strong>Su Howl</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Will) which deals psychic damage and renders its
targets vulnerable 5 to all damage (save ends). On a miss, the target takes half
damage and is vulnerable for a turn. This recharges wherever the alpha takes
psychic damage. They possess both signature abilities.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>It’s another carnivorous ape monster in a book that already has too many of
them. The lore and mechanics seem to disagree with each other on whether su
monsters are sapient. The stats say they are Int 2 beasts, but the lore keeps
saying they organize in “tribes”, a term I’ve avoided using here.</p>

<p>The mechanics themselves are mildly interesting, but I don’t like them enough to
use them paired with this lore.</p>

<p>Star Spawn made their debut in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/02/03/star-spawn.html">Monster Manual 2</a> along with a pretty
awesome chunk of lore that’s also tied to star pact warlocks and the Far
Realm. You can see it all on the link. This entry adds a bit more lore, new star
spawn, and a surprise epic boss!</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The lore in this entry confirms some of the most terrible questions we had in
the MM2. Yes, if you travel far enough in space you do end up in the Far
Realm. Yes, there are things watching across this divide, and some of them are
perceived by the people of the middle world as stars. And yes, some of them have
hostile designs upon the world.</p>

<p>Allabar, the Opener of the Way, is one of these, and it travels across the
universe inciting its fellow stars to send their spawn into the world. Its
wanderings are not random, but filled with terrible purpose. Some warlocks claim
Allabar and its allies are at war with the world itself, and they call this the
Forgotten War because it’s much less noticeable than the Dawn War was but no
less significant.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The star spawn presented here are all mid-to-high epic tier threats, making them
a lot stronger than the paragon-tier spawn from the MM2. All of them have the
aberrant origin and possess darkvision, but the specifics vary a lot between
individual stat blocks.</p>

<h3 id="spawn-of-ulban">Spawn of Ulban</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-ulban.png"/>

</figure>

<p>Ulban is a blue-white star whose intense glow affects mortal minds, disrupting
their cognition and robbing them of the ability to recognize danger. Ulban’s
influence starts ill-thought rebellions and prevents divinations of any sort
from working. Its spawn fall to the earth as meteors, and their presence makes
mortals unable to distinguish friend from foe. They also break the “no
tentacles” streak for this type of monster, as you can see in the illustration.</p>

<p>Spawn of Ulban are Medium Aberrant Humanoids, and Level 26 Controllers with 241
HP. They have a speed of 8. They’re immune to domination, and every time they’re
iht by a power that would dominate them, they dominate the attacker instead! And
this is a (save ends) condition even if the one from the attack wasn’t.</p>

<p>The spawn’s basic attack is the <strong>Bluefire Strike</strong> (vs. Reflex), which causes
both cold and fire damage, and dazes for a turn. It can also use a <strong>Touch of
Strife</strong> (vs. Will) instead, dealing psychic damage and forcing the target to
make a melee or ranged basic attack against a creature of the spawn’s
choice. When it hits with either of these attacks, it can apply a <strong>Psychic
Boost</strong> as a free action, dealing an extra chunk of psychic damage. This
recharges every time the spawn takes psychic damage, so while it’s not
<em>resistant</em> to this damage type you still don’t want to use it against the
spawn.</p>

<p>Less often, the spawn can produce a <strong>Ripple of Betrayal</strong> (close burst 1
vs. Will, recharge 5+) which deals psychic damage and dominates those it hits
(save ends).</p>

<p>As a minor action, the spawn can use <strong>Far Realm Reflection</strong> to form an
eldritch bond with a creature it can see. Whenever that creature shifts, the
spawn can immediately shift an equal number of squares. This lasts until the end
of the encounter, or until the spawn switches targets by using the power
again. An excellent power to use on an ally that can shift long distances, or
even on a PC that can do the same.</p>

<p>The Spawn of Ulban wants to get in close and stay there, since its attacks are
all melee or close bursts. It’s extremely effective against parties with lots of
psionic PCs, or against those that have lots of Essentials martial
characters. The best way to fight it is to keep your distance and hit it with
non-psychic, non-dominating attacks.</p>

<h3 id="emissary-of-caiphon">Emissary of Caiphon</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-caiphon.png"/>

</figure>

<p>Caiphon is a purple star that can always be found near the horizon, sometimes
even during the day. It presents itself as a helpful guide star, but will
sometimes betray those who rely on it, leading them down tragic paths.</p>

<p>The Emissary of Caiphon is often employed in these betrayals. It’s the most
human-looking of all star spawn, and it mimics the tactics of its patrons by
posing as a guide or a prophet. Its “wise and helpful” advice usually leads to a
lot suffering and death.</p>

<p>The Emissary is a Medium Aberrant Humanoid, and a Level 28 Controller with the
Leader tag and 257 HP. It projects an <strong>Aura of Ruin</strong> (2) that inflicts a -2
penalty to saves, and whenever it’s hit by an attack that would blind it, it
blinds the attacker instead (save ends).</p>

<p>Nearly all of the Emissary’s powers mess with the saving throw mechanic, but it
lacks the ability to inflict (save ends) conditions by itself. Be sure to pair
it with plenty of monsters who can do that!</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>Touch of Despair</strong> that deals light physical damage and
inflicts an extra 20 damage the first time the target fails a save before the
start of the emissary next turn. It’s nifty, but it’s for emercencies only. The
creature prefers to stay far away and use its ranged attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Blinded By Greed</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will) deals light psychic damage, slides the
target 2 squares, and forces them to make a melee basic attack against a target
of the emissary’s choice (“Give me that! It’s mine!”).</p>

<p><strong>Blinded By Need</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will) deals standard psychic damage, and
allows the emissary to choose one of the target’s allies. For the next turn, the
target is marked by that ally, and everyone except the chosen ally is invisible
to the target. This doesn’t <em>force</em> the target and the ally to fight each
other, but it makes it hard for either of them to do anything else.</p>

<p>As minor actions, the emissary can use <strong>Deceptive Veil</strong> to disguise itself as
a Medium or Small humanoid, with a DC 40 for people to see through the
illusion. It can also target someone with an <strong>Invocation of Calamity</strong> (ranged
5 vs. Will), which on a hit makes the target fail all of their saves during the
next turn.</p>

<p>For triggered actions, it has the same <strong>Psionic Boost</strong> as the Spawn of Ulban,
this time applying to tis Blinded By Need/Greed powers. And when it dies,
<strong>Foretelling the Doom</strong> targets an enemy suffering from a (save ends) condition
and inflicts a -5 penalty on all saves against it until one succeeds.</p>

<h3 id="serpent-of-nihal">Serpent of Nihal</h3>

<figure class="center">

<p>Nihal, the Serpent Star, is a reddish celestial body that can’t stay still. It
travels a random snaking route around the point it was supposed to occupy in the
sky according to all standard calculations. That’s why it received this
epithet.</p>

<p>The Serpents of Nihal first came through the world shortly before the fall of
the ancient empire of Az-Kiral, which dedicated itself to the worship of
Zehir. Its leaders grew ever more ambitious and soon they craved more power than
the snake god was willing to offer. So they sought out a new source of Snek
Power, and found it in Nihal. They opened a portal to the star thinking they
would be able to access this power. What happened instead was that countless
Serpents of Nihal poured through, and destroyed the empire in a matter of
days. They still wander the known cosmos today, and I guess sometimes Allabar
opens new rifts to let more through.</p>

<p>Serpents are Medium Aberrant Beasts, and Level 29 Minion Lurkers with a ground
speed of 7. They’re only partially present in reality, and keep blinking in and
out.</p>

<p>This means that, despite being minions, they have <strong>Resist 20 to all
damage</strong>. Yes, even untyped. You need to deal 21 or more damage with one strike
to take them out. It’s not that hard for late epic PCs, but it’s also not 100%
guaranteed, so they have more staying power than your typical minion.</p>

<p>Serpents attack with <strong>mindbites</strong>, which deal psychic damage and can interfere
with concentration and psionic power usage: if 2 or more of the serpent’s allies
are adjacent to the target, the bite deals extra damage and prevents the target
from spending action points or power points (save ends).</p>

<p>If an enemy misses the serpent, it can <strong>Depart Reality</strong>, removing itself from
play for a turn an re-appearing in adjacent to an enemy within 20 squares of its
original location. It can also do this exact same thing when it rolls initiative
with the <strong>Sudden Reality Warp</strong> ability.</p>

<h3 id="allabar-opener-of-the-way">Allabar, Opener of the Way</h3>

<p>Yup, you read that right. This is not a star spawn, it’s a <em>star</em>. Allabar is
here to serve as the end boss for a campaign focused on the Forgotten War, which
would likely feature the PCs facing and unraveling the plans of increasingly
powerful aberrant creatures and star spawn until Allabar itself decides to
personally kill them. As the lore implies, Allabar is not the only eldritch star
who wants to mess with the world, but it’s the most consciously malicious one
and it acts as instigator and enabler to the others. Eliminating Allabar would
effectively end the threat posed by its fellows and their respective star spawn.</p>

<p>Putting the lore in astronomical terms would make Allabar similar to a rogue
planet, a planet without a star that moves across the universe. The similarity
is only superficial, of course, because pretty much nothing else about the
Opener of the Way is in any way scientific.</p>

<p>Allabar is presented here as a Gargantuan Aberrant Animate. Those who feel even
Gargantuan is too small for a planetary entity might instead say this is an
avatar of Allabar, the thing it sends through a portal to personally fight the
PCs. When it dies, the star winks out from the sky. Or you can take a page from
Atropus in Elder Evils, and have the actual body of Allabar be the
dungeon/battlefield on which you fight its avatar.</p>

<p>Anyway, Allabar is a Level 30 Solo Soldier with 1100 HP. It has ground and
flight speeds of 6, with Hover. As a planet, it projects a <strong>Gravity Well</strong> that
acts as a 20-square wide aura. This plus its Gargantuan size pretty much mean it
covers the entire battle map. Anyone who starts their turn inside the field gets
pulled a variable number of squares depending on how much HP Allabar currently
has. It starts at 1 square, and doubles for every 25% of its HP that are missing
(at 25% or less total HP, it’s 8 squares).</p>

<p>Being covered with eyes, Allabar has <strong>All-Around Vision</strong>, and can’t be
flanked. Its <strong>Bloodied Fury</strong> also gives it an extra standard action per turn
while it’s bloodied, even when it’s dazed.</p>

<p>In combat, the Opener of the Way projects Reach 4 <strong>Tentacles</strong> to attack, which
deal light physical damage and restrain for a turn on a hit. It can use them in
a <strong>Triple Attack</strong> to strike three times in a standard action, and it can
enhance a tentacle attack with a <strong>Psionic Boost</strong> similar to that of the star
spawn in this entry. Aside from the boost recharging when Allabar takes psychic
damage, it also recharges when the star succeeds with its <strong>Devour Body</strong>
attack. This Close Burst 1 vs. Fortitude targets creatures who are at 0 HP or
lower. On a hit, it kills the target and pulls it inside Allabar. It <em>can</em>
target dead allies, but it’s also excellent for making PCs exercise those “when
you die” abilities they surely have by now.</p>

<p>Another very interesting attack is <strong>Wrath of the Forsaken World</strong> (close blast
5 vs. Fortitude, recharge 5+), which deals psychic damage and causes each target
to sprout a hostile tentacle (save ends). While the tentacle is there, it deals
an automatic 20 damage to any target that ends their turn within 2 squares of
the victim.</p>

<p>As a minor action, you know, no big deal, the Opener can use <strong>Unravel Essence</strong>
(melee 4 vs. Fortitude), which inflicts 20 ongoing damage on a hit (save
ends). On the first failed save, this increases to 25. On the second, the target
also becomes weakened and insubstantial. On the third, the target drops to 0 HP
if its HP was still positive. A successful save at any point halts the process
and clears all related conditions. This recharges whenever there are no
creatures affected by it.</p>

<p>And finally, when someone hits Allabar with an attack, it can cause <strong>Psychic
Feedback</strong> as a reaction, automatically dazing the attacker (save ends).</p>

<p>Allabar is very intelligent and will work to maximize its advantages, abusing
its flight and superior reach, and focusing fire make them drop to 0 HP quickly
so they can be devoured. And if your level 30 PCs are cocky because this end
boss is “only” level 30, add a few Emissaries of Caiphon to make it impossible
for them to pass the many saves imposed by the Opener of the Way.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The awesome continues! This entry does return to the old standby of “tentacles”,
but the monsters are still pretty evocative and their mechanics
interesting. Allabar reminds me of Atropus, from Elder Evils, but it’s has more
of an aberrant/psychic theme instead of Atropus’ undead/necrotic leanings.</p>

<p>The Opener of the Way is the fourth and last epic boss to be found in this
book. The previous ones were Imix, Lolth, and Ogrémoch.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Not only have monstrous spiders been in the game since the beginning, they’ve
been on every monster book we read so far. The MM3 is no exception in this
case.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Looks like the Web Walk trait was a <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/01/05/spider.html">Monster Vault</a> innovation. The spiders
in the MM3 don’t have it, but it would make sense for them to do so. They do
already use fixed math, like the other monsters in this book.</p>

<p>All spiders here have a climb speed equal to their ground speed, with the Spider
Climb keyword to signal that they can also walk on ceilings. They also have
Tremorsense 5.</p>

<h2 id="ambush-spider">Ambush Spider</h2>

<p>Sometimes you have to go back to basics, and you can’t get any more basic than
this. These Medium natural spiders behave much like mundane trapdoor spiders,
using webs to camouflage their hidey-holes and charging out of them to bite and
inject venom into their prey. As Level 2 Lurkers with 28 HP, they’re likely the
first giant spider any group of adventures is going to face. I’m surprised
something like this only showed up in the MM3. Their speed is a breezy 8.</p>

<p>The spider’s <strong>Camouflage</strong> trait allows it to hide when it has only partial
cover or concealment. Its basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong>, but it turns into a
<strong>Venomous Bite</strong> if made against a creature the spider is hidden from. This
does the same damage and can be used in a charge. It also slows the target and
inflicts 5 ongoing poison damage (save ends). This worsens to immobilized after
the first failed save.</p>

<h2 id="spiderling">Spiderling</h2>

<p>Spiderlings are immature giant spiders, merely Small in size. This is a generic
stat block that can be used to represent youngsters of any of the spider species
presented here or elsewhere. They’re Level 4 Minion Skirmishers with Speed 6 and
a basic bite attack.</p>

<p>The attack deals only 2 poison damage, but it also gives poison vulnerability 5
to the target for a turn. If the target is already vulnerable to poison their
vulnerability increases by 2 instead. This means that multiple spiderling bites
on the same victim add up very fast, particularly if the adults join in at the
end. You can vary their level based on the expected level of the adult
specimens.</p>

<h2 id="feyspitter-spider">Feyspitter Spider</h2>

<p>This spider native to the Feywild produces a venom laced with psychedelic
fairy-tale qualities. Aside from the usual physiological damage, it also forces
its victims to dance uncontrolably! Over time, feyspitter hunting grounds come
to look like clearings where the vegetation has been stomped flat by all the
dancers.</p>

<p>Feyspitters are Medium Fey Beasts and Level 7 Controllers with 80 HP and a Speed
of 6. Their <strong>bite</strong> deals physical damage and inflicts 5 ongoing poison damage
(save ends). Each time the victim fails a save, the spider can slide them 3
squares.</p>

<p>They can also use <strong>Poison Spittle</strong> to spray their venom in a Close
Blast 3. This deams 10 ongoing poison damage on everyone it hits, with the same
sliding effect on each failed save. Finally, if hit in melee, feyspitters can
use a <strong>Fey Leap</strong> (recharge 5+) to teleport 3 squares as an interrupt. Yes,
this means they can jump out of melee range and negate any damage.</p>

<h3 id="lolths-reaver">Lolth’s Reaver</h3>

<p>Another epic level spider directly associated with Lolth. These spiders don’t
exist in the wild. Instead, they’re bred by Lolth’s worshippers and fed the
blood of elves, eladrin and angels from an early age. Their upbringing makes
them sapient and Chaotic Evil. They commonly serve as mounts for Abyssal Drow,
and can also be found as pets and guardians in Lolth’s mightiest temples
elsewhere in the universe.</p>

<p>Reavers are Large Elemental Beasts with the Mount and Spider keywords. They’re
Level 25 Brutes with 287 HP. They have a ground speed of 8, but their Climb
speed is only 6. Their mount trait is <strong>Web Saddle</strong>, which prevents their rider
from being involuntarily dismounted by forced movement. I never even knew this
was a possibility for anyone else, so I find this very interesting. Enough PCs
have easy access to forced movement that staying mounted might very well be a
problem for an enemy rider in most situations. Not here, though.</p>

<p>Reavers fight with their extremely venomous <strong>bites</strong>, which deal light physical
damage and inflict 20 ongoing poison damage (save ends). They can shoot
<strong>Grasping Threads</strong> at range, which deal no damage but pull the target 5
squares and restrain them (save ends). Each failed saving throw causes the
reaver to pull the target an additional 5 squares. There is no hard limit on the
number of targets that can be restrained in this way.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the reaver can perform a <strong>Web Leap</strong>, jumping 8 squares
without provoking opportunity attacks and spreaying a Close Blast 3 with sticky
webs when they land. This does heavy physical damage, knocks its targets prone,
and prevents them from standing up (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="spider-webs">Spider Webs</h3>

<p>This is not a monster, but a side box with example terrain features based on
spider webs. All of the spiders in this entry and most of the ones in previous
books are web-spinners, so these should see heavy usage in arachnid-themed
dungeons.</p>

<p>These hazards have variable DCs and attack rolls based on their level, which
should be similar to that of the overall encounter. The more badass the spider,
the more badass its webs.</p>

<p><strong>Web Sheets</strong> are nearly invisible vertical webs, usually placed across
passages and corridors. Spotting them requires a Perception test against the
hard DC for their level. When someone enters their space, they attack the
victim’s Reflex and immobilize them (save ends). A close or area fire attack
destroys the whole web, a melee fire attack destroys one square of it.</p>

<p><strong>Cobwebs</strong> are thick and opaque sheets of webbing covering walls, floors, and
ceilings. Spiders use these for concealment, hiding behind them until it’s time
to burst out and strike. They provide total concealment, and spiders can usually
perceive enemies through them using tremorsense. They might also count as
difficult terrain.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We’re starting to repeat ourselves a bit with all these spiders, but it’s nice
to see a low-level example. I also really liked the Feyspitter for its dancing
venom.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/10/23/orchard-of-time.html">The Orchard of Time</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I had an interesting dream recently that gave me what I think is a neat idea for
a dungeon location: The Orchard of Time.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>It’s started out as your standard divine orchard, a bit like the Garden of the
Hesperides. It was owned and operated by a powerful spirit or minor deity, and
its trees gave fruit that ranged from “mundane but high-quality” to “outright
miraculous” the further in you went. If you got to the very center, you could
harvest the Peaches of Immortality or something equally awesome.</p>

<p>Something happened to the Orchard’s original owners and they left, abandoning
the place. Monstrous fauna from the surrounding regions moved in and either
overwhelmed the previous guardians or entered some sort of symbiosis with
them. These new monsters found ample food in the trees of the Orchard, whose
energies mutated them to be larger and stronger.</p>

<p>One day, a powerful arch-wizard found the Orchard’s location and decided to go
for the Peaches. This extremely arrogant individual was sure he would succeed
where all others have failed. After all, the others weren’t him! He armed
himself with his best spells and his best magic items, and teleported to the
Orchard’s entrance (can’t teleport into it from outside). Then he boldly strode
past the gate, and cast his most powerful magic.</p>

<p>This was a custom spell that would stop time everywhere in the Orchard except
for an area five meters or so in radius around the wizard himself. The idea was
that, with time stoped, the archmage could just walk up to the really good trees
in the center while dodging the place’s many inhabitants. If he needed to remove
any of them, he could bring them into the “active time” circle and use his other
magic to handle them one individual or small group at a time.</p>

<p>Of course, the wizard’s hubris got the better of him at exactly the worst
time. Maybe he had miscalculated when creating the spell, or maybe he made a
critical error when casting it. The fact is that our wizard just
kinda… exploded, leaving behind only his ornate metal staff.</p>

<p>Ironically, the spell itself worked exactly as planned. Even better in fact, as
the same error that deleted our wizard made it last forever. It’s centered on
the wizard’s staff, which stands planted on the ground just inside the Orchard’s
entrance gate.</p>

<h2 id="layout-and-hazards">Layout and Hazards</h2>

<p>The Orchard is located in a hidden valley and is bordered by tall forested
mountains. The climate can range from temperate to tropical depending on what
kind of fruit you want it to contain. As mentioned above, vestigial divine wards
prevent people from finding it with divination or from teleporting into it from
outside. It can still be found via good old-fashioned research, as its location
is recorded in ancient religious texts and in the unfortunate wizard’s own
notes. The wizard has also helpfully dispelled any magical defenses that
prevented people from just walking through the main gate.</p>

<p>The Orchard of Time was a little overgrown from its period of abandonment, but
still retains its characteristic layout. There are many trees but they’re spaced
far apart. Cobbled paths wind their way among them. Grass and other wild plants
reach up to a human’s knees between the trees and paths. This space used to be
taken up by a lawn and flower beds, but these have been overwhelmed by native
plants.</p>

<p>This means that despite covering a very large area, the Orchard has excellent
sight lines and a clearly navigable layout. You can see a good deal of its
significant landmarks from the entrance gate and it’s impossible to get lost
inside. These excellent sight lines work against intruders such as the PCs,
because they allow the many, many monsters and guardians that live here to see
them from far away. These creatures are all hostile, territorial, and generally
incapable of dialogue either because they have animal intellect or because
they’re some sort of construct. In the dream I had these monsters definitely
included a variety of Rodents of Unusual Size. There are almost more monsters
than there are fruit, and they all more or less converge on the location of any
intruders they can perceive.</p>

<p>Or they <em>would</em>, if time hadn’t stopped inside. The wizard’s staff is just
inside the entrance, and it projects a field of “normal time” in a 5-meter
radius around itself. Everything outside this bubble and inside the orchard’s
outer walls is frozen in time, and has been for a long time (decades?
centuries?).</p>

<p>PCs who want to succeed where the arrogant wizard failed need to carry the staff
with them. Getting close enough to a monster that it enters the “bubble” will
unfreeze the creature, and it will imediately attack. There might be a route
that allows them to avoid most of the creatures, but not all.</p>

<p>In addition to the copious monsters, the permanent time stop might have created
hazardous areas inside the Orchard, where space or time itself behave in harmful
ways. These might be almost impossible to detect until they’re inside the active
time bubble, which would make them reveal themselves in a dramatic fashion.</p>

<h2 id="why-go-there">Why go there?</h2>

<p>The most obvious reason to delve the Orchard of Time is to get its most awesome
fruits from the big trees at the center, like the wizard wanted to do. The
Orchard might also contain buildings of interest (such as libraries or treasure
vaults), along with the bodies of ancient adventurers who tried to delve the
place before the ill-fated wizard. Some of these might be legendary themselves,
and have died carrying their equally legendary gear.</p>

<p>A slightly alternate Orchard would have been invaded by the wizard while it was
still operational! In this case it’s going to be in pristine condition, with all
of its original guardians and security systems still in place. Even its <em>owners</em>
will still be around, frozen in time like flies in amber. Freeing them is an
excellent goal for more heroic sorts, or at least for sorts who need the
specific help whose divine entities are able to provide.</p>

<p>However, since those owners are frozen in time, they’re still going to be under
the impression that they’re being invaded by a cheeky wizard. And look at you,
carrying his staff around like that. Better talk fast!</p>
