<p>D&amp;D Third Edition made many attempts to create new monsters that would grow
popular enough to become iconic, and I think these little critters were one of
their greatest successes even though they weren’t an intentional attempt.</p>

<p>They first appeared as custom opposition in The Sunless Citadel, the very first
official module for Third Edition. They had a very specific origin tied to the
overall story arc of that campaign. That origin is mentioned in version, but we
also see some lore that talks about them in the Vale.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Twig blights look like large woody shrubs or small trees with interlocking
branches. They can change shape somewhat to blend in with the surrounding
vegetation, and they can also uproot and twist themselves into roughly humanoid
shapes in order to hunt or migrate.</p>

<p>Blights need fresh blood to reproduce and grow, using their roots to absorb it
from the soil or directly from corpses. New seedlings sprout from their root
systems, as many as a dozen at a time. They’re very fragile early on, but mature
quickly and after a few days are big enough to start ambushing small creatures.</p>

<p>The first blights originated from the Gulthias Tree, which grew from the stake
used to slay ancient vampire who went by that name. Some people speculate that
repeating the process to create a similar tree could create new varieties of
twig blight, though of course few are unbalanced or evil enough to try.</p>

<p>Our Vale-specific story is about a lonely pig farmer named Fellis, who was the
first to discover these creatures in the Vale. A strange new bush appeared
overnight in his slaughter shed, and soon it began sprouting seedlings. Fellis
loved the little scamps, giving them names and playing them tunes on his
flute. His neighbors were very worried about all of this weirdness, but still
regularly went there to trade for pig meat.</p>

<p>During that winter, however, severe snow storms tore through the region and made
regular travel impossible until the thaw. When Fellis’ neighbors managed to get
to his farm again, they saw that the man, his family, his pigs, and even the cat
had all been killed. All that was left was a number of pulsating bushes
sprouting from their corpses. Several nearby villages banded together to burn
out the infestation, but a few individuals managed to escape into the
surrounding woods. So now we can add “twig blight infestation” to the list of
everyday disasters that can fall upon the people of the Vale.</p>

<p>Twig blights can survive from normal soil nutrients and sunlight like mundane
plants, but they vastly prefer to have access to a blood supply. Their numbers
increase rapidly when they can find a big source like a slaughterhouse or
battlefield, though even a single corpse is enough to let their reproduction
cycle continue. When their current blood supply runs dry, they’ll uproot
themselves to look for more. If can’t find a new victim or supply quickly,
they’ll take root again and wait in ambush.</p>

<p>Twig blights can even be found in dungeons, ruins, caves, and other places never
touched by the sun. Without access to light, they become even more bloodthirsty
than usual.</p>

<p>Some powerful creatures try to make use of twig blights as unguided boundary
guardians by seeding them along that boundary. However, the creatures are fickle
and as likely to follow the wind to nearby settlements as they are to stay in
place.</p>

<p>Twig Blights are monsters. They have some intelligence and can even speak Elven,
but they only use that to set up smarter ambushes. They only see other
creatures, sapient or not, as food sources, and only interact with them through
violence. You might be able to keep them contained for a while if you supply
them with enough blood, like Fellis did, but their reproductive cycle will
ensure their population quickly outstrips the supply, at which point they’ll
begin hunting for live prey (which means <em>you</em>).</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Twig Blights are Small Fey Humanoids with the Plant tag. They have ground and
climb Speeds of 5 with Forest Walk, and Darkvision. They have Resist Poison 5
and the non-minions have Vulnerable to Fire 5. Their signature trait is
<strong>Rooted</strong>, which reduces forced movement from pulls, pushes, or slides by 3
squares.</p>

<p>Like their original 3e incarnation, they’re early Heroic opposition.</p>

<h3 id="twig-blight-seedling">Twig Blight Seedling</h3>

<p>A seedling who just grew big enough to hunt. It’s a Level 1 Minion
Skirmisher. Their <strong>claw</strong> attack lets them shift 2 squares before making the
roll, deals poison damage, and has a small damage bonus when the target is
granting them combat advantage.</p>

<p>Their tactics are simple: surround and kill.</p>

<h3 id="twig-blight">Twig Blight</h3>

<p>The classic model is a Level 2 Lurker with 28 HP. It can turn <strong>invisible</strong> for
a turn with a standard action, and surprise opponents with <strong>Blighted Claw</strong>
attacks that do heavy poison damage and weaken (save ends). Even a miss still
does half damage and weakens for a turn.</p>

<p>If the blight can’t become invisible, it can still attack with basic <strong>claw</strong>
attacks that do a typical amount of poison damage.</p>

<h3 id="twig-blight-swampvine">Twig Blight Swampvine</h3>

<p>This is a new variant! It could be that classic blights adapted themselves to a
swampy environment… or it could be that someone out there did prove the
stake-tree theorem. They’re particularly common in the Witchlight Fens along the
Nentir River.</p>

<p>Swampvines are Level 3 Soldiers with 42 HP. They’ll use their minor actions to
pull targets close using a <strong>Swamp Vine</strong>, which also grabs them (escape DC
13). If a grabbed target attacks someone other than the swampvine, they take an
automatic 5 poison damage. They can also make basic <strong>claw</strong> attacks that do
poison damage.</p>

<h3 id="twig-blight-swarm">Twig Blight Swarm</h3>

<p>A big bunch of classic twig blights that decided to stop being subtle. It’s a
Large Swarm made up of Small creatures, and a Level 5 Brute with 74 HP. It’s
Swarm Attack aura deals 3 damage to those inside, and while it looses its
specific vulnerability to fire it’s still vulnerable to close and area attacks
like any other swarm.</p>

<p>Its version of <strong>Rooted</strong> makes it completely immune to being pushed, pulled, or
slid, and its <strong>Swarm of Claws</strong> basic attack deals poison damage.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m sure there are lots of people who will be happy to have official 4e stats
for Twig Blights. Their explicitly unnatural origin and their monstrous
disposition tends to make them better “guilt-free” low-level opponents than your
usual selection of humanoids.</p>

<p>This incarnation of them is also quite tricky for low-level PCs to handle, since
a lot of their early powers rely on forced movement for their more interesting
effects.</p>

<p>Treants appear in the MM1 in a generic form. Here we see not one but two
specific treant factions present in the Vale.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Before the hillfolk, before the Tigerclaw, before even the elves, the Nentir
Vale was covered by a single, vast forest. And in this forest, the treants
ruled. They feared no one, not even the mighty dragons, for the entire region
was under the protection of Malorunth the Eternal Ash, a gigantic tree who as
also a powerful archfey.</p>

<p>One spring evening, however, Malorunth died under mysterious circumstances. The
once vigorous tree was now entirely petrified, leaves falling from its brittle
branches in droves. With Malorunth dead, its blessing left the Vale, and the
dragons who coveted it were quick to capitalize on the opportunity, arriving in
large numbers.</p>

<p>The battle that followed between treant and dragon was called the War of Endless
Branches, and it’s because of this war that the Nentir Vale looks like it does
today. Draconic magic and breath weapons cut a swathe of devastation across the
center of the region that created the large open area there, and separated
Winterbole Forest to the north from Harken Forest to the south.</p>

<p>The dragons would go on to win the war and move into the “cleared” area. They
were powerful, but what really brought them victory was the growing distrust and
suspicion among the treants themselves, which caused them to stop working
together and turn on each other.</p>

<p>You see, the deciduous treants began to think their coniferous relatives had
something to do with the death of Malorunth, and this suspicion festered enough
that they began voicing it aloud for everyone to hear. Arguments turned to
fights, and soon the treants were more concerned with their brand new civil war
than with keeping the dragons out.</p>

<p>This civil war caused the conifers to migrate north to Winterbole forest, where
they would eventually begin venerating the archfey of winter known as the Prince
of Frost. The deciduous treants stayed in Harken Forest, paying homage to the
petrified corpse of Malorunth, which still stands today. They believe the
Eternal Ash will be brought back to life if its murder can be avenged.</p>

<p>The war technically still rages, but it does so at a treant’s pace. There’s a
battle every century or two, when one of the group manages to organize a Great
March to attack the other’s territory. The fact that they must cross the entire
Vale to do so makes these marches even harder to organize, and slower to
happen. The last one was two hundred years ago, when Harken attacked
Winterbole. The next one will probably be a Winterbole attack, but sometimes it
happens that the same side will launch two attacks in a row.</p>

<p>Yes, the last battle in this war is older than the fall of Nerath, and there
probably are no surviving Nerathi records of it. Maybe there are a few very old
elves and eladrin who remember it. And maybe the Frost Witches or Harken’s Heart
druids might know, since they live in those forests. But almost no one else has
any idea that a new Great March might be in their future.</p>

<h2 id="winterbole-treants">Winterbole Treants</h2>

<figure class="center">

</figure>

<p>These conifer creatures consider fleshy humanoids to be annoying pests and
parasites, and try to keep their territory free of them. This is made more
difficult by the fact that their slice of Winterbole Forest has a lot of
Arkhosian ruins and Shadowfell crossings in it, so delvers and explorers often
seek those out.</p>

<p>They also have an alliance with Bitterstrike, whom we already met. The dragon
believes the treants to be her vassals, and they put up with this delusion as
long as she holds up her end of the bargain and assists them in the next Great
March.</p>

<p>Like all treants, they are Fey Magical Beasts with the Plant and Treant tags. In
addition to low-light vision, they have both Forest Walk and Ice Walk, ignoring
difficult terrain with either or both of these themes. Needless to say this type
of terrain is plentiful in their home ground. They also have Resist Cold 10 -
even the minion.</p>

<h3 id="winterbole-sapling">Winterbole Sapling</h3>

<p>These Medium saplings are energetic and aggressive, and often team up with
Winterbole-aligned Wood Woads in raids against the Tigerclaw and other
trespassers. They’re Level 11 Minion Soldiers with a Speed of 6. Their <strong>Slams</strong>
deal a bit of damage and immobilize for a turn, and their <strong>Numbing Branches</strong>
aura (1) deals 3 damage to immobilized enemies that start their turns inside.</p>

<p>This makes for enemies who likes to mob and surround a single target. If even
one of them hits, all of their auras will deal damage that round.</p>

<h3 id="winterbole-rimeneedle">Winterbole Rimeneedle</h3>

<p>Rimeneedles are the most intelligent of the “lesser” conifers, and tend to act
as scouts. They’re Large, and Level 12 Skirmishers with 122 HP. It has a Speed
of 8.</p>

<p>Rimeneedles are probably going to start the fight with <strong>Winter’s Step</strong>, a move
action encounter power that lets them teleport 5 squares and make a Close Burst
2 attack on arrival. This deals cold damage, half on a miss. It probably
involves forcefully ejecting those rime needles.</p>

<p>Since this is a move action, the treant can immediately follow it up with a
basic <strong>slam</strong> or with <strong>Tree Stomp</strong>, which lets it shift its speed and move
through enemy spaces while doing so. The rimeneedle can make one slam attack
against an enemy along this path, and will additionally knock the enemy prone if
it hits.</p>

<p>Fortunately as a non-minion treant, it has the <strong>Wooden Body</strong> weakness, which
causes it to ignite and take ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends) from any attack
that deals fire damage.</p>

<h3 id="winterbole-frostbeard">Winterbole Frostbeard</h3>

<p>The leaders of the Winterbole treants are the venerable Frostbeards, who can
command the winter. They’re rare and seldom seen by others, but they’re out
there.</p>

<p>Forstbeards are Level 16 Elite Controllers with the Leader tag and 308 HP. Their
size is Huge, their speed is 8, and they’re immune to being knocked prone. Their
<strong>Deep Roots</strong> reduce any forced movement inflicted on them by 2 (which can
negate the movement entirely), and when they spend their action point every ally
within 10 squares can make a free basic melee attack.</p>

<p>Their opening move is likely a <strong>Howling Blizzard</strong>, an encounter power that
deals heavy cold and thunder damage in an Area Burst 2 within 10 squares, and
knocks prone on a hit. The blizzard lingers as a zone that deals 10 cold damage
to people who end their turns inside. The frostbeard can move the zone up to 5
squares with a move action, and sustain it with a minor action.</p>

<p>Once the zone is in the battlefield, the frostbeard will likely wade inside it
and begin hitting people with <strong>Slams</strong>, which it can make as part of a <strong>Double
Attack</strong>. If things begin to look dicey, it can call upon the <strong>Spirits of the
Forest</strong> (move action, recharge 6+) to teleport itself and up to 3 nearby allies
up to 5 squares, granting them +2 to all defenses for a turn on arrival.</p>

<p>I guess their main weakness, aside from the usual Wooden Body, is that they have
three different things they can do with their move action: move the blizzard,
use Spirits of the Forest, or make normal moves. If they’re doing one of them,
they can’t do the others unless they give up their standard action. Therefore,
it’s possible to play “keep-away” with them to make them fight at less than
optimal strength. If you stay rooted to one spot, though, they’ll fight you with
slams while pulling the blizzard to sit on top of themselves.</p>

<h2 id="harken-treants">Harken Treants</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-treants-harken.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The deciduous treants of the Harken forest are quite standard as far as rules
go. They use the standard stat blocks for the Treant and Bramblewood Treant from
the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/01/06/treant.html">Monster Vault</a>. They do often work alongside wood woads, so we have a
couple of stat blocks for those in addition to the (by now slightly outdated)
basic stats from the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/03/08/wood-woad.html">Monster Manual 2</a>.</p>

<p>Their leader is the most exceptional thing about them: Mysteriphal is the oldest
living creature in the entire Vale. He was there when Malorunth fell, and swore
to forever protect his petrified husk. As mentioned above, Mysteriphal believes
Malorunth will return to life once his murder is avenged. In our narrative
present he’s a huge fire-and-curse scarred thing, any hints of his former
kindness and nobility long gone.</p>

<h3 id="wood-woad-druid">Wood Woad Druid</h3>

<p>I guess the existence of these guys explains why the Harken treants wouldn’t be
allied with the Harken’s Heart druids. They’re Level 14 Skirmishers with the
Leader tag and 145 HP.</p>

<p>The druid only has a speed of 5 and no Forest Walk, but it’s immune to the
Immobilized, Restrained, and Slowed conditions. It will likely try to approach a
squishy PC and use <strong>Polymorph Into Plant</strong> on them. This targets Fortitude, and
does what it says on the tin. It lasts for a turn or until the druid drops to 0
HP, whatever comes first. The polymorphed target is considered stunned, and
gains Vulnerable 15 to fire. This recharges whenever the druid misses with it,
so he can keep trying until it sticks.</p>

<p>If the polymorph attack doesn’t look like an attractive option, the druid can
hit people with his <strong>cudgel</strong>, using either basic attacks or a <strong>darting
strike</strong> that lets him shift 2 squares before or after the attack.</p>

<p>His leaderly options include <strong>Earthen Stride</strong> (at-will, move action), which
lets the druid and an adjacent ally shift 2 squares; and <strong>Nature’s Boon</strong>
(minor, encounter) which gives a plant ally 25 temporary HP.</p>

<h3 id="wood-woad-juggernaut">Wood Woad Juggernaut</h3>

<p>This Level 15 Brute is Large instead of Medium. He has 160 HP and fights mostly
with his powerful <strong>slams</strong>. He will charge if at all possible, since he has
Resist All 15 while charging.</p>

<p>Once his preferred opponent is within his melee reach of 2, the juggernaut will
try to tag them with <strong>Nature’s Reign</strong> (recharge 5+), a more damaging strike
that also inflicts ongoing 10 damage (save ends), and heals the juggernaut for
the same amount whenever the target takes this ongoing damage.</p>

<h3 id="mysteriphal">Mysteriphal</h3>

<p>The leader of the Harken treants is a Huge specimen, and a Level 20 Solo
Controller with 768 HP. This probably makes him the most powerful individual in
the whole Vale. Everything about him hints at his tremendous age, from his
scarred look to his stats. He ponderously drags himself at a speed of 4 without
Forest Walk, but is immune to poison since he has had time to build a tolerance
to all of them.</p>

<p>As an <strong>Ancient Entity</strong>, Mysteriphal automatically downgrades the Dominated and
Stunned conditions to Dazed. His long fighting experience gives him
<strong>Threatening Reach 3</strong>, but he’s even more flammable than a typical treant. He
takes ongoing 10 damage (save ends) when he takes fire damage, but while on fire
his melee attacks also deal an extra 10 fire damage.</p>

<p>Mysteriphal’s powerful Reach 3 <strong>slams</strong> damage and push the target 1 square,
and he can make <em>four</em> of them with a single standard action. If someone in
reach deals fire damage to him, he can make a free slam against the offender as
a reaction (which will already benefit from that bonus fire damage).</p>

<p>He also has several other tricks he can surprise his opponents with. Instead of
slamming he can use a <strong>Reverberating Word</strong> that attacks all nonplants in a
Close Burst 3, deals heavy thunder damage, and dazes for a turn. This is perfect
for use with an action point, since it lets him do <em>this</em> and still punch his
enemies. It also recharges when Mysteriphal is first bloodied, so that second
solo action point also has an easy pre-defined use.</p>

<p>As a minor action he can use a Reach 3 <strong>Root Grab</strong> to grab a target (DC 25)
and pull them up to 2 squares. He can have up to four different creatures
grabbed this way. This doesn’t deal damage… unless Mysteriphal is on fire,
when it benefits from the bonus. And if you think you’re safe by putting some
difficult terrain between Mysteriphal and yourself, the wily old treant can
<strong>Teleport</strong> 4 squares as a move action (recharge 4+) and reach you anyway.</p>

<p>PCs fighting Mysteriphal might want to consider <em>avoiding</em> fire attacks. While
they’re still effective, they also make him much more dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>This is a tragic story all around. Probably only the treants themselves remember
why they’re fighting, and barely anyone else would remember they’re fighting at
all due to the long quiet periods between Great Marches.</p>

<p>The truth about Malorunth’s death is a mystery literally older than mortal
civilization, making it almost impossible to solve. And even if our nearly-Epic
PCs manage it, it’s probably still not enough to get the treants to end their
war. It might have started over this murder mystery, but after millenia of
conflict both sides have plenty of reason to keep hating each other.</p>

<p>We’ve heard about these people in several previous entries, and now is the time
to take a more detailed look at them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Tigerclaw people claim direct descent from the Hunter of Winter, a powerful
primal spirit in the shape of a sabertooth tiger who roamed the world when it
was young. Their stories tell of Hota Swiftstripe, one of their first
chieftains, who ran into the Hunter while he was tracking a bear near a
glacier. The spirit lashed out with a claw and took out one of Hota’s eyes
before he could even blink, but the chieftain proceeded to lure it to a frozen
lake.</p>

<p>The tiger’s great weight cracked the ice and caused it to fall in, but Hota fell
compassion for such a great hunter and reached out with his spear to help the
beast get out. The Hunter of Winter told Hota that from that moment on they were
brothers, since Hota bore the Hunter’s mark and had saved its life. Hota himself
would be blessed with the blood of the tiger, and so would all his
descendants. When Hota returned to his tribe, he was no longer a human, but one
of the first razorclaw shifters.</p>

<p>All of Hota’s descendants were shifters as well, so today the Tigerclaw are
divided into two sub-groups. The Tigerbloods who occupy important roles such as
chieftain, shaman, and several types of elite warrior; and the Tamed,
non-shifters who work as gatherers, artisans and rank-and-file warriors. These
are not quite castes despite being called such by the book: there is a way for
one of the Tamed to become a Tigerblood.</p>

<p>When a Tamed has proven themselves worthy, the tribe’s chieftain invokes a rite
of initiation where the candidate must hunt and attempt to subdue a sabertooth
tiger. They must not <em>kill</em> it - this is seen as a grave offense punishable by
death. Those who succeed are elevated to Tigerblood status. While they do not
become shifters themselves, they’re paired with a Tigerblood shifter so that
their children are born shifters. There doesn’t seem to be any gender-based role
division within the Tigerclaw, or at least the book doesn’t mention any. The
important one is the Tigerblood/Tamed distinction.</p>

<p>The Tigerclaw used to live all around the Vale, but were driven north when
Nerath began to encroach on their territory. Chief Scargash’s tribe lives in
Winterbole Forest in our present, and has been there for 70 years after
returning from the frozen wastes north of the forest. Presumably there are other
tribes who still live up there. The book says they sometimes kidnap worthy
outsiders as mates to keep their numbers up, or adopt orphans from other
communities for the same reason. The first alternative is a horrible cliche, so
I’d suggest focusing more on the second and saying they also take in willing and
worthy adult outsiders instead of kidnapping them.</p>

<p>That said, the Tigerclaw are usually distrustful of outsiders. They remember
Nerath and the empires that came before, all of whom tried to impose their ways
on their people only to eventually crumble to dust while the Tigerclaw
endured. They consider all “creatures” outside their tribe to be hunters
competing for territory, whether those creatures are monsters or people. These
“competitors” can be negotiated and traded with, but never fully trusted. And if
they threaten the tribe, the Tigerclaw think no more of raiding a human or elven
settlement than they would of cleaning out a nest of snakes or culling an uppity
wolf pack.</p>

<p>Their society also has its own criminals and outlaws, too. Tribe members who
slay their kin or steal from the tribe are either put to death or exiled,
depending on the severity of the crime. Those who are exiled are known as the
Riven. Most of them are quite evil and resort to worship of evil spirits or
demons to survive when cut off from the tribe. While some live as lone hunters,
others band together in marauder groups who make a living raiding both their
former kin and the outsider communities found south of Winterbole.</p>

<p>The largest of these groups is led by a shaman named Shadowfang, who was exiled
for worshipping a giant demon lord named Kostchtie. They are based west of the
Winter River and frequently go south to raid villages and towns. The Lord Warden
of Fallcrest has a standing bounty on Shadowfang’s head. The book doesn’t
mention whether the people of the Vale distinguish between Riven and standard
Tigerclaw, so you can vary your answer there depending on what sort of story you
want to tell.</p>

<p>Their biggest internal conflict right now comes from the fact that Chief
Scargash and his shamans are making a serious attempt at opening diplomatic
channels to the other sapient inhabitants of Winterbole: the Frost Witches, the
Treants, and Bitterstrike. This appears to be working, but it has the more
traditionalist of the Tigerblood worried because they fear this will make the
Hunter of Winter see them as “soft” and withdraw its gifts. In other words,
they’re like fighting and know successful diplomacy will leave them with less
excuses to pick fights.</p>

<p>We already saw how Bitterstrike and the Frost Witches see these attempts, and
we’ll look at the treants in a bit.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get several stat blocks for Tigerclaw warriors here, spanning most of the
Heroic tier. I’ll look at them in order of level.</p>

<p>The stat blocks are either humans or shifters. Shifters get low-light vision and
might have transformation-related abilities that kick in while they’re bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="tigerclaw-hordling">Tigerclaw Hordling</h3>

<p>Likely a Tamed warrior of no particular distinction, this human is a Level 3
Minion Skirmisher. They attack with a battleaxe that crits on a 18-20, though
the damage increase from the critical is not spectacular since this is still a
minion.</p>

<h3 id="tigerclaw-brave">Tigerclaw Brave</h3>

<p>This human is a skilled warrior, which means they might one day undergo the
Tigerblood initiation ritual. They’re a Level 3 Soldier with 49 HP.</p>

<p>Braves fight with a <strong>Broadsword</strong> in melee and throw  <strong>Sabertooth Spears</strong> at
range (they carry 2). The sword makes basic attacks that mark for a turn on a
hit. The spear targets Reflex and immobilizes for a turn on a hit. On a miss it
deals half damage and slows for a turn. This is not an at-will attack: it
recharges when the brave is bloodied.</p>

<p>If a marked enemy adjacent to the brave shifts, they can use a <strong>Sabertooth
Jab</strong> to make a free sword attack against them.</p>

<h3 id="tigerclaw-scout">Tigerclaw Scout</h3>

<p>This is a shifter, which means they’re definitely a Tigerblood. They’re also a
Level 4 Skirmisher with 55 HP.</p>

<p>The scout is an <strong>Adept Charger</strong>, which means they’re not limited to taking
only free actions after a charge. Their <strong>Razorclaw Flurry</strong> power gives them a
+2 bonus to Speed and a +4 to defenses against opportunity attacks while
bloodied.</p>

<p>Scouts fight with paired <strong>Light Picks</strong>, meant to invoke the image of a
sabertooth tiger’s fangs. They do an extra die of damage if used on a charge,
and can use a power named <strong>Sabertooth Strike</strong> to attack two different targets
at once. This recharges as long as at least one of the attacks misses.</p>

<p>If an enemy ends its movement in a square where it flanks the scout, the scout
can use <strong>Wild Instinct</strong> as a reaction to shift 2 squares.</p>

<h3 id="tigerclaw-fang-wielder">Tigerclaw Fang-Wielder</h3>

<p>This shifter is a Level 5 Brute with 77 HP. They use a <strong>heavy war pick</strong>, whose
attacks to extra damage while they’re bloodied. It can also be used in a <strong>Fang
of the Sabertooth</strong> maneuver (recharge 5+), which does heavy damage, knocks
prone, and on a critical hit inflicts 5 ongoing damage (save ends).</p>

<p>When the Fang-Wielder first becomes bloodied, they use a reaction named
<strong>Winter’s Rage</strong>, which is an attack on a Close Burst 1 that damages and knocks
prone on a hit, does half damage on a miss, and pushes 1 square as an effect.</p>

<p>Fang-Wielders want to charge right in and actually like getting surrounded by
melee PCs, because all of their best traits kick in when they’re bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="tigerclaw-shaman">Tigerclaw Shaman</h3>

<p>These shifters act as spiritual advisors and general spellcasters for the
Tigerclaw. They’re Level 5 Controllers with 52 HP. In combat they use a
<strong>Longspear</strong> and some mind-affecting magic.</p>

<p>This includes the <strong>Phantom Fangs</strong> at-will spell, which on a hit does psychic
damage and immobilizes for a turn, and on a miss slows for a turn. It also
includes the <strong>Concussive Roar</strong> encounter power, a minor action that attacks a
Close Blast 3 and on a hit pushes targets 3 squares and immobilizes them. On a
miss it pushes 1 square instead, but in either case it does no damage.</p>

<h3 id="sabertooth-tiger">Sabertooth Tiger</h3>

<p>Yes, as implied in the lore the Tigerclaw make use of sabertooth tigers as
pets. Tigerblood candidates have to tame a wild tiger as part of their
initiation, and I imagine they also breed and raise tigers to accompany
hereditary Tigerbloods. An encounter involving Tigerclaw members is also likely
to involve these beasties.</p>

<p>Sabertooth Tigers are Large Natural Beasts with the Mount keyword and Level 6
Soldiers with 72 HP. They have a ground speed of 8 and a climb speed of 4. Their
<strong>Charging Pounce</strong> trait works like the scout’s Adept Charger, letting them
make any type of action after a charge. And their <strong>Tiger Charge</strong> trait gives a
+2 damage bonus to the charge attacks of their rider.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bites</strong> do extra damage on a charge, and grab on a hit (escape DC
15). If the tiger has a grabbed victim, it can only bite that victim. It can
also use <strong>Puncturing Fangs</strong> against them. This hits automatically, does some
physical damage, and inflicts ongoing 5 damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Tigers are higher level than most of the humanoids in this entry, but this is
not a problem because ever since the Monster Vault mount monsters no longer have
to be of equal or lower level than their riders. You can safely drop this
restriction from all older monsters as well.</p>

<p>Tigers want to charge in, grab someone, and keep using Puncturing Fangs on
them, preferrably while their rider attacks.</p>

<h3 id="scargash-tigerclaw-chief">Scargash, Tigerclaw Chief</h3>

<p>Scargash seems to be a fairly typical Tigerclaw chief as far as stats go. You
could use the same stats for chiefs of other tribes if any appear in your
game. He’s a shifter, of course, and a Level 6 Elite Brute with the Leader tag
and 176 HP.</p>

<p>Scargash gains a +2 bonus to all of his defenses while bloodied, and his
leadership style expresses itself as an aura (5) named <strong>Encircle the Prey</strong>,
which grants allies +2 to damage on attacks against targets they are flanking.</p>

<p>His <strong>War Pick</strong> inflicts ongoing damage on a hit and can be used in a <strong>Double
Attack</strong>. If both of those attacks hit the target also suffers a -2 penalty to
all defenses.</p>

<p>His encounter power is a <strong>Staggering Swipe</strong> that damages the target and does
half damage on a miss. As an <em>effect</em>, it also slides the target 3 squares to a
space adjacent to one or more other enemies. Those enemies take an automatic 10
damage and fall prone as the flung target bowls into them.</p>

<h3 id="primal-sabertooth-tiger">Primal Sabertooth Tiger</h3>

<p>The kind of majestic mount a Tigerclaw chief would ride into battle. They could
be extraordinary mundane specimens, but are likely somehow blessed by the Hunter
in Winter either naturally or via Tigerclaw rituals. Primal sabertooths are Huge
Natural Beasts with the Mount keyword and Level 8 Elite Soldiers with 178 HP.</p>

<p>They have the same Charging Pounce trait as their smaller relatives, and also
have Threatening Reach 2. Their basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Claw</strong> that damages
and inflicts 5 ongoing damage. If the target was already taking ongoing damage,
this inflicts 10 ongoing damage instead. This means that a second claw attack on
the same target will worsen their ongoing damage, or that a first attack will
already inflict the worse condition if the target was taking ongoing 5 damage
from another source.</p>

<p>The primal tiger’s <strong>Bite</strong> is a minor action. It does light damage and grabs
with escape DC 20. The tiger can pull the victim along when it moves without
provoking opportunity attacks from the victim. Only one victim may be grabbed at
a time.</p>

<p>Their special attack is <strong>Go For the Kill</strong> (recharge 5+), which targets Reflex,
deals heavy damage, knocks prone, and gives the tiger 5 temporary HP if the
attack bloodies the victim.</p>

<p>When the tiger hits 0 HP, it can shift its speed and use Go For The Kill one
last time. If this reduces the target to 0 HP, the tiger heals back to 20 HP
instead of dying. This ability, called <strong>Fierce Spirit</strong>, is an encounter power,
so the tiger can’t use it again in the same fight.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The book uses the word “barbarian” a lot, but I’ve avoided doing it here. I
suppose they’re barbarians in the D&amp;D class sense, but I wouldn’t want to use
the rest of that word’s baggage with them. And if I included the Tigerclaw in a
game, I’d definitely remove the bit where they raid other communities for
“worthy mates”. It’s still a bad trope no matter how you look at it.</p>

<p>Removing that shitty trope leaves you with a fairly complex people as far as D&amp;D
cultures go. They’re not likely to be very friendly to outsider PCs, but they
have good reasons for their suspicion. Outsiders can still interact with them in
peaceful ways with a bit of work, and they would make a good origin culture for
martial or primal PCs.</p>

<p>If Bitterstrike decides to go a-conquering, she’ll want to force Scargash’s
tribe to act as her front-line troops. I imagine their traditionalists will
welcome this since it will mean an end to diplomacy followed by lots of battles,
but most of the tribe would resent serving under the dragon and/or being
manipulated by Frost Witches who would surely be the secret instigators of the
whole thing. They’re the first troops you fight, but they’re also the weak link
you work in order to dismantle the Army of Winter.</p>

<p>Shadowfang’s bunch makes for a much less ambiguous enemy faction, but PCs who
like to go for the diplomatic solution would still have plenty to do in a
scenario where the people of Winterhaven and Fallcrest had trouble telling them
apart from other Tigerclaw and directed their enmity at all of them.</p>

<p>Here’s our third dragon!</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The black dragon Shadowmire has made the Witchlight Fens his home for over two
hundred years. He’s the more active and aggressive of the Vale’s current
draconic inhabitants, and I guess also the one most like a typical dragon.</p>

<p>Shadowmire claims the entire extent of the Witchlight Fens as his dominion,
but though his personal power is terrifying, his power <em>base</em> is not quite up to
the task of controlling all of that territory. The dragon rules many of the
lizardfolk tribes who live on the area as a terrifying overlord, and while
they’re not always capable of preventing others from encroaching into the fens,
Shadowmire uses them to punish any groups foolish enough to do so. He likes to
brag that the fall of Kalton Manor was his greatest victory, though he was not
the sole factor involved in that tragedy.</p>

<p>The dragon’s main goal is to turn his claims into reality, and to grow ever
wealthier and more powerful in the process. He patrols the Fens to make its
inhabitants fear him, and can sometimes be seen flying over the Nentir River
where it passes by the swamp. He can also move more stealthily, even swimming
silently where the water is deep enough.</p>

<p>Shadowmire’s lair is under the Cairnwater river, accessible through an
underwater entrance at the river bed. Its true location is known only to the
dragon himself, but there’s much speculation about it and the treasures it
contains. Shadowmire is entirely aware of this and keeps a number of fake lairs
throughout the fens, which he uses to misdirect his enemies and lure greedy
adventurers to their doom. The dragon increases his hoard by looting those
greedy adventurers, and by raiding trade boats that pass through the Nentir
river.</p>

<p>Since he’s lived in the Fens for so long, Shadowmire knows practically every one
of its secrets, and a good deal about the story of the Vale besides. He also
makes some effort to remain aware of the Vale’s current affairs through his
network of spies.</p>

<p>Not every inhabitant of the Fens serves the dragon, and some even try to oppose
him. I imagine there might be a hag coven or two who have objections to his
rule, but the group the book calls out as the most persistent torn on
Shadowmire’s side are the Daggerburg Goblins! They regularly venture into the
fens and clash with Shadowmire’s lizardfolk servants. I imagine they might be in
a true pickle if the dragon decides to retaliate personally, but he doesn’t like
leaving the Fens.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Shadowmire’s stats make me think all three dragons were written by different
authors, because he’s Huge and a Level 19 Solo Lurker with 712 HP. This makes
him the most powerful dragon in the book, even stronger than slumbering
Calastryx. I guess this is balanced by the fact that he has the weakest army, as
his lizarfolk aren’t very organized and can’t operate very well outside the
swamp. This limits how far he can expand.</p>

<p>Despite having a level comparable to that of a “stock” Elder Black Dragon,
Shadowmire has a slightly less varied repertoire of attacks. His passive traits
are all work the same, as do his <strong>bite</strong>, <strong>Breath Weapon</strong>, and <strong>Bloodied
Breath</strong>.</p>

<p>Bite and Breath Weapon do less damage than the ones from the base elder
dragon. The difference here is that the Threats writers considered the added
ongoing acid damage from both the bite and the breath to be part of the damage
formula, while the Monster Vault writers added them on top of that. Both bite
and breath do half damage on a miss, too, so a fight against Shadowmire is a
grueling battle of attrition.</p>

<p>Shadowmire’s <strong>Claw</strong> attacks do the same damage as a base elder dragon’s, and
pull the target 2 squares. His <strong>Tail Sweep</strong> works the same but does more base
damage.</p>

<p>And finally we get to the star of the show, his custom ability: <strong>Swamp
Simulacrum</strong>. When used, this makes Shadowmire turn invisible for a turn and
summons 2 identical duplicates within 10 squares of the original. They last
until the end of the encounter or until destroyed. The duplicates are
effectively minions with Shadowmire’s defenses, and explode in a burst of acid
when destroyed (Close Burst 2, acid damage, half on a miss). This recharges when
the dragon is first bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Shadowmire is an interest mechanical variation on an elder black dragon, and his
lore is workable enough, but I think he’s a bit too high level to fit with that
lore. I’d probably make him Level 12 or so. He’s more dangerous and intelligent
than Bitterstrike, but is not seen as a living calamity like Calastryx.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Another more generic entry. I first remember seeing scroll mummies in 3e where
they appeared in the Monster Manual III. I wouldn’t be surprised if they date
from earlier editions than that. There’s a bit of an AD&amp;D 2nd Edition vibe to
them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Despite the name, these creatures are constructs, not undead. They’re armatures
made from magical detritus (broken magic items, shards of potion vials, and so
on) wrapped in spell scrolls. They style of the wrapping makes them resemble
mummies, so I guess the name stuck.</p>

<p>They are however still undead-adjacent because each one is powered by a lich’s
soul. To activate a scroll mummy, you need to destroy a lich and place its soul
vessel inside the finished body of the construct before the lich can
reform. The lich’s soul is bound as a power source, and the mummy rises to obey
its creator like a typical construct.</p>

<p>Scroll mummies are fairly clever as constructs go, and their construction gives
them the ability to cast the spells written on their wrappings. In the Vale, the
Mages of Saruun know how to create scroll mummies and love using them to guard
their private libraries. Most other people who know the secret of their
construction are more explicitly evil mages and priests, many of which worship
Vecna.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a complication here: if a scroll mummy is destroyed and the
soul vessel survives, the lich it belongs to will reform within 1d10 days. It
will likely also be pretty angry at whoever decided to turn it into a glorified
battery.</p>

<p>The first scroll mummy ever created was named Grisgol, and its heart was the
vessel of the lich Asperdies. Legend has it that Asperdies eventually found a
way to break out of his imprisonment and took his revenge on Grisgol’s
creators. To this day, wizards who are particular about terminology prefer to
call these constructs “grisgols” since they aren’t true mummies.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Grisgols are Large Natural Animates with the Construct keyword, and also Level
15 Elite Soldiers with 276 HP. That puts them at about the same power level or a
bit higher than a typical lich. Its basic attack is a <strong>Paralyzing Claw</strong>,
borrowing the power of a lich’s touch. It’s Reach 2, does necrotic damage, and
immobilizes for a turn.</p>

<p>Once per round as a minor action, the grisgol can cast a spell from one of the
scrolls wrapping it. The GM rolls a d6 to determine the effect. All of them are
bursts or blasts with different elemental damage types and riders.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Boiling Blood</strong>: Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude, immediate and ongoing fire
damage on a hit (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ice Barrage</strong>: Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex, cold damage, half on a miss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lightning Lure</strong>: Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex, lightning damage, pulls 4
squares.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shadowy Tendrils</strong>: Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude, necrotic damage, inflicts
necrotic vulnerability (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Thunderforce Pulse</strong>: Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude, thunder and force
damage, knocks prone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wave of Madness</strong>: Close Blast 5 vs. Will, psychic damage, target must
choose between making a basic attack against an adjacent ally or taking
extra psychic damage.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I imagine that in past editions these would be standard spells, but here they’re
custom.</p>

<p>When a grisgol is reduced to 0 HP, it collapses and releases a cloud of
<strong>Choking Dust</strong> in a Close Burst 2. This attack does both immediate and ongoing
necrotic and poison damage (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>It’s interesting that Vecna, who spreads lichdom rituals, would also be the
source of the recipe for scroll mummies. Maybe it was all a scam from the start,
or maybe he feels it’s a waste to simply kill all those “competing” liches who
are affiliated with Orcus.</p>

<p>I guess this also gives a plausible reason for some shady wizards to not want to
become liches. “A lich? You mean like those things I use to power my guards?”</p>

<p>In addition the treasure these things might be guarding, their own bodies might
serve as a plausible source of treasure for an encounter. Maybe one of those
broken magic items isn’t so broken after all, and maybe you can bring combat
scrolls back into 4e by giving them out as consumables that let PCs use one of
the grisgol’s spell attacks once.</p>
