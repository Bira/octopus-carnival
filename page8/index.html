<p>Archons in the 4e sense were introduced in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/02/03/wir-mm-4e-archons.html">Monster Manual</a> as soldiers
created by the primordials to face the angelic legions of the gods in
battle. Though some still serve the primordials, others sell their services as
mercenaries to other elemental clients.</p>

<p>The first MM had stats for fire and ice archons, and this one brings us three
new types: earth, storm, and water. Earth and water archons already made an
appearance in our Let’s Read because they’re in the Monster Vault, but
chronologically this is their first appearance in the edition. There are enough
stat blocks in here that I feel I can give each type its own post. We start with
Earth Archons.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The basic lore for archons remains the same, as outlined in my post about their
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/02/03/wir-mm-4e-archons.html">first Monster Manual entry</a>. Earth archons have some extra bits specific to
them in this book.</p>

<p>Earth archons look like faceless stone humanoids, following the general archon
theme. Their armor and weapons are made of copper-colored metal with crystal and
obsidian accents. Their military strategy follows the “patient earth” theme:
they attack with slow and inexorable advances, and take the time to occupy and
fortify any positions they take as they do so.</p>

<p>The greatest earth archon fortress is Thrak-Harda in the Elemental Chaos, which
is ruled by the stone titan King Brakkamul and was built to guard the Diamond of
Despair. Legend has it that the fortress is meant to protect the outside world
from the Diamond, and not the other way around. No one seems to know why it’s so
dangerous, but the Dao (cousins of the djinns and efreets) have been obsessed
with it for a very long time.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Earth archons are Medium Elemental Humanoids with the Earth keyword. They have
Tremorsense 20 and are immune to disease, poison, and petrification. Their
ground speed is 6 with Earth Walk, which means they ignore “geological”
difficult terrain.</p>

<h3 id="earth-archon-ground-rager">Earth Archon Ground Rager</h3>

<p>This archon is a Level 14 Controller with 143 HP and a bunch of earth-bending
powers. These start with <strong>Ground Liquefaction</strong>, an aura (5) that slows any
creature without the Earth keyword that starts its turn inside and doesn’t move
during it. I guess this is meant to simulate then slowly sinking into shallow
quicksand, but as written it also affects fliers. Maybe tendrils of mud reach
out to grasp them.</p>

<p>In melee, ragers use <strong>slams</strong> and <strong>shoves</strong> to fight. The former are basic
attacks, and the later are a bit weaker but push the target 4 squares and knock
them prone. Two words: stone sumotori.</p>

<p>At range they can attack with a spell called <strong>Raging Earth</strong> (ranged 20
vs. Reflex) which counts as a basic attack, does a little damage and immobilizes
(save ends). Less often they can cause <strong>Ground Eruptions</strong> (area burst 1 within
10 vs. Reflex; recharge 5-6) which do a bit more damage and knock prone. On a
miss, they do half damage and still knock prone.</p>

<p>The book says ground ragers are drawn to geologically active areas, so you can
expect additional earth-based hazards when fighting them. Good luck staying on
your feet.</p>

<h3 id="earth-archon-seismic-striker">Earth Archon Seismic Striker</h3>

<p>The rank and file of earth archon armies is made up of Level 16 Soldiers with
160 HP. They wear plate and wield heavy shields and war picks. They also carry
javelins for throwing.</p>

<p>Those <strong>picks</strong> are high-crit weapons that do a mix of physical and thunder
damage. The <strong>javelins</strong> have range 10/20 and mark the target for a turn on a
hit.</p>

<p>They can also use a <strong>Seismic Stomp</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Fortitude) to deal area
damage. A miss does half damage. In either case, the targets are knocked
prone. This is a good thing for seismic strikers because the <strong>Ground Striker</strong>
trait makes their attacks stronger against prone targets.</p>

<p>Seismic Strikers have a version of the fighter’s <strong>Combat Superiority</strong>
trait, gaining a +5 bonus to opportunity attack rolls and stopping the movement
of any target they hit with such an attack.</p>

<p>As written, the Stomp is not a “friendly” attack, but I’d definitely make at
least other earth archons immune to it. This would allow strikers to stay closer
together while still keeping enough distance from each other to lure foolish
enemies into the “gaps” in their formation, where they’ll be stopped cold by
opportunity attacks and knocked prone by overlapping stomps.</p>

<h3 id="earth-archon-rumbler">Earth Archon Rumbler</h3>

<p>Rumblers are shock troops at the spearhead of any attack, which I imagine makes
them look like a living avalanche from afar. They are Level 17 Brutes with 204
HP, wearing plate and wielding warhammers.</p>

<p>They can use the <strong>warhammers</strong> either for basic attacks or for <strong>Avalanche
Strikes</strong> (vs. Reflex), which do less damage but knock prone on a hit. Their
<strong>Thundering Might</strong> trait gives them bonus damage when adjacent to more than
one enemy, so they really like to be where the fighting is fiercest.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get a couple of sample encounters here. A level 14 one with a mix of earth,
fire and ice archons; and a level 18 one with a troop of assorted earth archons
in the employ of a cambion hellfire magus.</p>

<p>Earth archons seem to have a stronger theme than the MM archons, and better
supported by their mechanics. Their damage is still low due to the math bug, but
other than that they’re generally well-built and should be OK to use after a
damage update.</p>

<p>“Ant, Giant” is the actual title for the entry. Now that’s some old-school
naming! Giant ants have been part of the game since the beginning, so this style
feels appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>There isn’t a lot of mystery to giant ants. They’re red ants the size of an
adult human. Their colonies can have hundreds of individuals, and though that’s
far less than the teeming millions of a mundane anthill, they end up doing a lot
more damage due to their larger size. Once a giant ant colony gets going, it
will swiftly strip the landscape bare for miles around it.</p>

<p>Most ants are classified as “workers”, and as the name implies they handle the
actual work of building the colony and keeping it fed. You also have some larger
variants that are more specialized for combat, and protect the workers. And each
colony has a single Queen who is responsible for laying eggs and perpetuating
the hive. Though the queen is unlikely to leave her chambers once the hive is
established, she’s quite dangerous and remains active throughout her life.</p>

<p>Despite being of animal intelligence, giant ants possess the same instinct for
teamwork as their mundane counterparts, which means their colonies are more
efficiently organized than many sapient societies. They communicate by emitting
pheromone clouds, and at this scale the chemicals that make up these clouds can
actually be harmful to non-ants. Giant warrior ants are notorious for using them
as weapons.</p>

<p>That bit about “stripping the landscape bare” makes me think giant ants combine
the traits of both army and leafcutter ants. So they’d both hunt other animals
directly and cut up the vegetation to serve as bedding for their vast
underground fungus farms. If that’s the case you do <em>not</em> want a giant anthill
anywhere near your territory.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Most giant ants are Medium Natural Beasts, with queens being Large. They have
low-light vision and tremorsense 10, but none of them are trained in
Perception. They all have a climb speed equal to their ground speed, though they
lack Spider Climb and so can’t cling to ceilings.</p>

<p>There are several types of giant ant and all of them have some sort of
<strong>Frenzy</strong> ability, which triggers when another giant and within 10 squares
drops to 0 HP. The exact effects vary per stat block, but note that if you have
a bunch of tightly packed ants the death of a single one will trigger Frenzy for
<em>all the rest</em>.</p>

<p>Level-wise they’re all early-to-mid Heroic, on par with the mundane guards and
soldiers for most playable peoples. This means fighting the spread of a giant
ant colony might be one of the common problems a sapient settlement has to deal
with, alongside bandits, stirges, or marauding goblins.</p>

<h3 id="hive-worker">Hive Worker</h3>

<p>The weakest and most numerous ant caste. They exist to fulfill the functional
needs of the colony and aren’t much good in a fight, but there are a <em>lot</em> of
them.</p>

<p>These are Level 1 Minion Skirmishers with ground and climb speeds of 6, and a
burrow speed of 2 with Tunneling. They’re the only giant ants with a burrow
speed.</p>

<p>Their only attack is a <strong>bite</strong>. Their <strong>Hive Worker Frenzy</strong> makes them shift 2
squares, so if you kill one the horde immediately moves to fill the gap.</p>

<h3 id="hive-warrior">Hive Warrior</h3>

<p>Warriors act as scouts and guards for worker expeditions. They’re Level 2
Skirmishers with 36 HP and a speed of 8. They attack with a <strong>Piercing Bite</strong>
that does physical damage, and also does bonus acid damage if the target was
already taking ongoing acid damage. The warrior itself can’t inflict this, so
you’ll want to pair it with a soldier, described below.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Hive Warrior Frenzy</strong> clears any mark or curse on them, and allows them
to shift 2 squares. Yes, this will make the party warlock sad.</p>

<h3 id="hive-soldier">Hive Soldier</h3>

<p>Stronger and scarier than common warriors, soldiers stay inside the hive to
guard it unless the queen directs them to sally forth. They’re level 3 Soldiers
with 46 HP and speeds of 6.</p>

<p>They fight with their <strong>Grasping Mandibles</strong> that grab the target on a hit. They
can use their <strong>Acid Sting</strong> against the grabbed victim, dealing both immediate
and ongoing acid damage (save ends). Note that this would allow any accompanying
warriors to get bonus bite damage against the victim.</p>

<p>When a soldier hits 0 HP it’s wracked by a <strong>Death Convulsion</strong> (close burst 1
vs. Reflex) which knocks enemies prone. Its <strong>Hive Soldier Frenzy</strong> gives it +2
to attacks for a turn when an ally dies.</p>

<h3 id="winged-drones">Winged Drones</h3>

<p>These flood out of the colony during mating season, ranging far and wide. At the
end of the season I guess the males die, and the females shed their wings and
burrow to become queens and form their colonies.</p>

<p>A winged drone is a Level 4 Skirmisher with 55 HP. It has ground, climb, and fly
speeds of 8. Its basic attack is an <strong>Acid Sting</strong> that does immediate and
ongoing acid damage, and it can perform a classic <strong>Flyby Attack</strong> maneuver with
it. As we already know, this allows the drone to fly its speed without drawing
opportunity attacks and sting someone at any point along the movement. Its
<strong>Hive Drone Frenzy</strong> allows it to shift 2 squares and use the sting.</p>

<p>Once bloodied, the drone can choose to violently shed its wings in a maneuver
called <strong>Shredding Wings</strong> (close blast 2 vs. AC), which does high physical
damage and causes it to lose its fly speed until the end of the encounter.</p>

<h3 id="hive-queen">Hive Queen</h3>

<p>Like their subjects, queens are of animal intelligence. However, they have an
instinctive drive for expanding their colony and the capability to direct their
subjects to go forth and conquer.</p>

<p>Queens are Level 5 Elite Controllers with the Leader keyword. They’re size
Large, and any other ants <strong>In the Presence of the Queen</strong> (aura 10) gain a +2
bonus to attack and damage. Their greater bulk makes them slower, so they have a
ground speed of 6 and a climb speed of 2.</p>

<p>Queens have two basic attacks: a <strong>bite</strong> and a <strong>kick</strong>. The kick targets
Reflex, does a bit of damage, and pushes the target 3 squares. The queen’s
<strong>Frenzy</strong> allows her to shift 2 squares and use Kick.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the queen can create an <strong>Acidic Cloud</strong> on a Close
Burst 4. This creates a zone that moves with the queen. Any enemy caught inside
takes 2 damage for each other giant ant that’s also in the zone. When first
bloodied, the queen issues a chemical <strong>Call to Arms</strong> that instantly summons
four giant ant workers to the fight.</p>

<p>They can also spray their pheromones in an <strong>Acidic Blast</strong> (area burst 3 within
10 vs. Will; recharge 5-6) which does acid damage and dazes (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Giant ant encounter groups will tend to contain only the various types of giant
ants: every other creature is food to them. The sample group is level 1 and has
1 soldier, 2 warriors and 4 workers.</p>

<p>Before reading this entry I don’t remember ever seeing much that differentiated
giant ants from all the other giant bugs, but their MM2 lore, sparse as it is,
has me unusually inspired. Mundane ant colonies can be a major problem to
farmers, and the giant version seems to pose even more of an existential threat
than a nearby bandit or goblin lair would.</p>

<p>Ankhegs appear in AD&amp;D 1st Edition, and they would go on to achieve minor fame
among players because of their lore.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Ankhegs are giant burrowing insects who dig mazelike tunnel networks and hunt by
bursting through the ground and snatching surface prey with their huge
mandibles. They also have acidic saliva, which they can spray at enemies.</p>

<p>These creatures live in “family units” consisting of a mated pair and a small
brood of young. These broodlings are rarely seen on the surface - their parents
bring prey to them underground. Other things might also be living in ankheg
tunnels, since the creatures don’t use all of it as living space.</p>

<p>This is the extent of the lore we get in the MM2, but it was the bits left out
that made ankhegs low-key famous. These bits say that ankhegs prefer to dig
through soil rich in minerals and organic matter. This means forests, but it
also means <em>good farmland</em>. Therefore, these creatures are likely to be found
very close to civilized settlements. I think I saw at least one source that said
having ankhegs underground actually improved the quality of the soil. If this
isn’t true in your campaign, it might very well be a common folk superstition.</p>

<p>Even if ankhegs don’t enrich the soil, their presence might still act as an
extra security measure against the many <em>other</em> dangers from the wild, assuming
the farmers in question can develop some way of avoiding the beasts
themselves. If you walk without rythm, you won’t attract the
worm. Unfortunately, it looks like they cannot be tamed, so farming in ankheg
country makes for a very interesting life. Fortunately, you won’t find more than
one “family” of ankhegs in a given area.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Ankhegs are Natural Beasts, with the adults being Large and the broodlings
Small. Both have tremorsense and a burrow speed, and are of animal intelligence.</p>

<h3 id="ankheg">Ankheg</h3>

<p>This adult specimen is a Level 3 Elite Lurker with 100 HP. It has Resist 5 Acid
to protect itself from its own saliva, a land speed of 8, and a burrowing speed
of 4 with the Tunneling keyword, which means it leaves stable tunnels behind.</p>

<p>The classic ankheg tactic is for the beast to use its Stealth training and
burrowing speed to lie in wait underground until it senses prey passing
above. Then it’s going to erupt and hit its victims with an <strong>Acid Spray</strong>
(close burst 3 vs. Reflex) which deals immediate and ongoing acid damage and
also slows (save ends both). It can do that again it if’s bloodied.</p>

<p>Next it’s going to nab the nearest victim using a <strong>Mandible Grab</strong>, which
damages and grabs (Acrobatics DC 16 or Athletics DC 14 to escape). It can only
grab one victim at once, but <strong>Mandible Carry</strong> allows it to move normally with
a grabbed victim. If the victim struggles too much the ankheg can also <strong>Gnaw
and Scuttle</strong> as a minor action, which requires an attack roll and does physical
damage and ongoing acid damage (save ends) in addition to allowing the monster
to shift 2 squares.</p>

<p>The ankheg can put a lot of distance between itself and its victim’s buddies in
a single turn by using a double move and spending a minor action on Gnaw and
Scuttle. Still, if someone does manage to reach it while it has a grabbed
victim, it can use <strong>claw</strong> attacks to fight in melee.</p>

<h3 id="ankheg-broodling">Ankheg Broodling</h3>

<p>Ankheg attacks are fun for the whole family, because you’re going to be jumped
by Mom and Dad, who will then carry you a ways underground so the kids can come
out and eat.</p>

<p>Broodlings are Level 1 Minion Brutes, with the same tremorsense as the adults, a
land speed of 6 and a burrow speed of 2 with Tunneling. They have basic <strong>claw</strong>
attacks along with a less accurate and more damaging <strong>Mandible Rip</strong> that deals
some “splash” acid damage to enemies adjacent to the target on a
critical. <strong>Brood Swarm</strong> gives them a +4 bonus when attacking a creature
grabbed by any ankheg. This more than negates the accuracy penalty from Mandible
Rip.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 4: a pair of ankhegs and 6 broodlings plus a rage
drake that was likely their original intended victim before the party came
along.</p>

<p>My initial impression of anhkegs was that they were just another big bug
monster, but the possibility of a setting where ankhegs under your farm fields
are just another fact of life makes the more interesting in my eyes. The section
on encounter groups also mentions that sometimes giant ants “take control” of a
group of broodlings after they drive their parents away, and I can almost hear
David Atenborough narrating that nature documentary.</p>

you can see by reading <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/01/21/angel.html">my first post on them</a>. The Monster Manual 2 brings
us a few stronger angels.</p>

<p>Since the original post was one of the first ones I wrote on the Let’s Read, I
hadn’t settled on the present structure yet, so I didn’t say much about the
common traits of angels.</p>

<p>Angels are Immortal Humanoids with the Angel keyword, which means they don’t
need to eat, breathe or sleep. Though they have no legs, they have a land speed
of 8 and a fly speed of 12. They’re also immune to fear and have 5/tier Radiant
resistance.</p>

<p>Their signature trait is <strong>Angelic Presence</strong>, a passive ability which inflicts
a -2 penalty on any attacks against the angel while it remains un-bloodied.</p>

<p>The angels from the Monster Manual 2 start at where the ones from the first book
stopped, in terms of power. This means they’re all epic level and mostly Large
in size.</p>

<h3 id="angel-of-authority">Angel of Authority</h3>

<p>These are the heralds and mouthpieces of a deity, and tend to handle some of the
most important tasks related to the protection and well-being of a deity’s
dominion. Your Metatrons, basically.</p>

<p>They’re Level 22 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 203 HP. They fight with
a <strong>quarterstaff</strong> doing a mix of physical and radiant damage, and shoot
<strong>lightning bolts</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) that do lightning damage and daze
for a turn.</p>

<p>They can also use their powerful voices for a <strong>Majestic Rally</strong> (close burst 5
vs. Will). This does a mix of thunder and radiant damage to any enemies caught
in the area and hit by the attack, and also weakens them (save ends). A miss
does half damage with no riders. Any allied angels in the area instead gain +2
to attacks for a turn. This is why the keyword is important!</p>

<h3 id="angel-of-retrieval">Angel of Retrieval</h3>

<p>Expert trackers, these angels lead squads of divine servitors and agents tasked
with recovering stolen relics or kidnapped creatures. In addition to the
abilities described in their combat stat block (below), they’re also trained in
rituals that allow it to find their quarry and quickly take the squad to it,
like Observe Creature and Planar Portal. They’re Level 22 Artillery with 162 HP
and all standard angel traits except Angelic Presence, plus a teleport speed of
5 and blindsight.</p>

<p>As soon as a fight starts, the Angel will use <strong>Hunt the Guilty</strong> on an enemy
within 10 squares, likely the main kidnapper. This will make all the angels
attacks deal extra damage against that enemy.</p>

<p>Then it’s going to use its flight and teleport speets to move within reach of
the target of the extraction and use <strong>Isolating Displacement</strong> on it. The power
can be either used on an enemy as an attack (reach 2 vs. Reflex) to deal radiant
damage, or on an ally as a non-damaging support ability. In both cases, it
teleports the target 5 squares, and teleports the angel to a space adjacen to
the target. The idea is to teleport the target into the midst of the angel’s
more melee-capable allies, who will either protect it and help it run away if
friendly, or beat it unconscious and carry it off if hostile.</p>

<p>It will then largely stay away and fire its <strong>Angelic Bow</strong> (ranged 20/40
vs. AC), which does radiant damage to the target and a smaller amount to any
other enemies adjacent to it. Perfect for disrupting tight formations.</p>

<p>Also perfect for disrupting formations is <strong>Clear the Way</strong> (area burst 3 within
10 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6), which deals radiant damage and slides the
targets 3 squares. A miss deals half damage and slides 1 square. This could be
used to clear a corridor for ther angel’s allies to escape, or to delay
pursuers.</p>

<p>If forced into melee, the angel of retrieval will defend itself with a <strong>short
sword</strong> that deals radiant damage, though this is clearly a sub-optimal
situation.</p>

<h3 id="angel-of-light">Angel of Light</h3>

<p>Angels of light are a little different from most of their relatives. They’re the
embodiments of a deities subconscious toughts, who form spontaneously in the
Astral Sea in their multitudes. Angels of light are driven to enact the thoughts
that spawned them, but they’ll also readily work for more powerful angels whose
dispositions match theirs. Once formed, an angel of light is an independent
individual. There have cases where they end up acting contrary to their
originating deity’s wishes because the god has changed their mind, or because
the thought was intrusive in the first place.</p>

<p>Angels of Light are the only Medium angels in this entry. They’re Level 23
Minion Skirmishers with all common traits discussed above. They fight with
<strong>angelic glaives</strong> that do radiant damage, and when killed explode in a <strong>death
burst</strong> whose text is a bit confusing. I think the intent is that it’s a close
burst 10 vs. Fortitude that does 10 damage to enemies in the area and heals
non-minion angels for 10 HP.</p>

<h3 id="angel-of-supremacy">Angel of Supremacy</h3>

<p>These described simply as “the strongest angelic fighters”, they’re said to
guard the homes of the gods and form the backbone of divine strike forces in
serious cosmic conflicts. I can’t shake the feeling that Asmodeus was one of
these before he rebelled.</p>

<p>Angels of Supremacy are Level 24 Soldiers with 226 HP and all common angel
traits. They fight with Reach 3 <strong>spears</strong> that do a mix of physical and thunder
damage, so here’s a surprise for PCs who loaded up on radiant resistance. They
also have <strong>Threatening Reach</strong>, which makes them pretty good at restricting
enemy movement.</p>

<p>They’ll likely start a fight by moving into a chokepoint and casting <strong>Astral
Brilliance</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Reflex; encounter). This deals radiant damage
and creates a zone that lasts until the end of the encounter. While inside the
zone, the angel’s attacks all deal extra radiant damage. Then they’ll attack a
particularly troublesome enemy with the <strong>Light of Justice</strong> (Ranged 10
vs. Fortitude), which deals radiant damage on a hit and marks the target for the
whole encounter as an effect. From that point on they can use <strong>Summons to
Justice</strong> (minor 1/round) to pull the marked target 1 square closer to
themselves.</p>

<p>Judging by those power names, I think they might have been named Angels of
Justice before an editing pass gave them this more sinister name.</p>

<h3 id="archangel">Archangel</h3>

<p>This isn’t a monster, but a template along the lines of those that first
appeared in the DMG 1. It’s meant to represent a higher-ranked angel that might
even be the greatest authority in a divine dominion aside from the actual
god. The template can be applied to any angel.</p>

<p>Here’s how I would apply it: I’d take a “regular” angel, and add the elite save
bonus (+2) and action point. If the angel was already elite, I’d upgrade it to a
solo with the +5 save bonuses and a total of 2 action points. In either case I’d
double its listed HP.</p>

<p>Then I’d add the template powers: <strong>Avenging Strike</strong>, which triggers when an
allied angel hits 0 HP and allows the angel to shift 2 squares and make a basic
melee attack against the slayer. And <strong>Overwhelming Presence</strong> (close burst 5
vs. Will; enemies only; encounter) which does radiant damage and stuns for a
turn.</p>

<p>I would then probably tweak its basic attack so it can be done twice in the same
turn, which is common in elite monsters.</p>

<p>So, to ammend my speculation, I’m pretty sure Asmodeus used to be an Archangel
of Supremacy.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like the 4e concept of angels, and so having more of them is cool.</p>

<p>Sample encounters in the MM2 are organized a little differently, with one after
each stat block instead of all of them being at the end of the entry. The ones
we get here are most all-angel teams, made up of a mix from the MM1 and MM2.</p>

<p>The notable exception is again the Angel of Supremacy encounter, which has three
of them along with a Tormenting Ghost (evil!) and a Deva Fallen Star
(super-evil!). This is a reminder that not all angels serve good deities, and
that creatures with “supremacy” in their names are creepy.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As I write this, I have just finished a <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">Let’s Read of the first D&amp;D 4 Monster
Manual and Monster Vault in parallel</a>, which took me about one year and four
months to complete and and around 2 years and 2 months to finish posting
here. This means it’s time to start up on the Monster Manual 2!</p>

<p>Published in 2009, this book includes both more varieties of monsters that
appeared in its predecessor, and those that are new either to the game or to
this edition of it. There’s not much in the way of preamble in its text: after
explaining the same thing I just did in the previous sentence, it launches into
a description of the stat block format and then goes right to the monster list.</p>

<p>Before I do the same, I’m going to use this post to describe some useful
information for people unfamiliar with either D&amp;D Fourth Edition, or the
conventions I’ve adopted over time while going through the first Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="fourth-edition-encounter-basics">Fourth Edition Encounter Basics</h2>

<p>While you don’t need to be intimately familiar with Fourth Edition D&amp;D to
understand my writeups, it helps to know some basic terminology.</p>

<p>4e uses the same level scale for monsters as it does for PCs. Monsters of the
same level are all worth the same amount of XP, and you calculate an encounter’s
level by adding up their XP values and adjusting it a bit for the size of your
PC party. The game’s platonic ideal of a “balanced encounter” is one where the
party faces a group of monsters of the same size and level as themselves. Note
that “balanced” here means a fairly easy fight of the sort the PCs can go
through several times per day. To make it harder increase either the number or
level of monsters, and vice-versa. A “level+1” or “level+2” encounter is
challenging, a “level+3” or “level+4” one are boss battle material. A difference
of +5 or greater is one of those situations where the PCs might be better off
running away.</p>

<p>Levels go from 1 to 30, though some rare monsters meant to be “final bosses” for
epic campaigns go a bit beyond that. It’s perfectly possible to have an entire
campaign where the party never fights a “balanced”, same-level battle.</p>

<p>Some monsters are “Elite”, which means they are more powerful and are worth two
regular creatures in the encounter building formula. Others are “Solos” and are
worth four regulars - but despite the name might not make for a fun encounter
all by themselves. Combat is a team sport! Last and least, a few are “minions”
which do less damage and go down in one hit. Four of these are worth a single
regular.</p>

<p>What this means is that you should never evaluate a monster in isolation. Always
assume it’s going to fight alongside a team of other opponents with
complimentary roles and abilities. This is true even for a lot of solo monsters.</p>

<h2 id="monster-roles">Monster Roles</h2>

<p>A monster’s role describes both the sort of tactic you should employ when using
it, and acts as a “class” of sorts. A monster’s attack bonuses, defenses, and HP
all depend on its level and role, not on what type of creature it is like in
3.x.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Skirmishers</em> have baseline stats across the board and abilities that make
them highly mobile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Brutes</em> hit hard in melee and take a lot of killin’. They have high HP, high
damage, and reduced AC.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Soldiers</em> are also melee combatants, but have high AC and tend to have
abilities similar to that of a PC fighter, being good at preventing the enemy
from targetting their more fragile buddies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Lurkers</em> have attacks that do a lot of damage but require some setup. A
typical lurker will have some sort of “routine” where it makes a big attack
one turn and spends the following turn setting it up again. This makes them
good for ambush scenarios.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Controllers</em> have stats similar to those of a skirmisher, but their abilities
are a mix of ranged and melee attacks that also inflict negative conditions on
the PCs or shape the battlefield in other ways.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Artillery</em> monsters are fragile and have lousy melee attacks, but their
ranged attacks are stronger and more accurate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When designing an encounter, you’re usually supposed to mix and match the roles
so that they complement each other. <em>In general</em> you want a “front line” made up
of soldiers and brutes, with artillery and controllers hanging back and
providing ranged support, and with lurkers and skirmishers running around the
edges trying to get past the PC’s own front line. The exact composition of your
Team Monster will of course alter this in all sorts of interesting ways.</p>

<p>The existence of monster roles means we’ll often encounter monsters with several
different stat blocks, which allow you to do something like an “all-bullywug
fight” that’s still tactically interesting.</p>

<h2 id="the-dreaded-math-bugs">The Dreaded Math Bugs</h2>

<p>While the foundation of the encounter design system in 4e was really solid, it
took a bit of time for the writers to fine-tune the math. Monsters from the
first Monster Manual generally did too little damage. Elites and Solos also had
defenses that were too high, and high-level solos in particular had ridiculously
large HP totals. All of this could lead to fights that were both too easy and
too long to be fun.</p>

<p>In the Monster Manual 2, some of these problems were fixed: Elites and Solos
lost their defense bonuses, and Solos have about 20% less HP than they would
have under MM1 rules. Brutes and soldiers also had their accuracy fine-tuned
(the former missed too much, the latter were too accurate).</p>

<p>From this point on you also start seeing minions with roles: where a MM1 monster
might have been described as a “Level 10 Minion”, here you might get a “Level 10
Minion Brute” for example. Role affects a minion’s defenses and damage, but not
their HP, which is always 1 with a “minions can’t be damaged by missed attacks”
condition.</p>

<p>One problem still remains: damage is still too low, by an amount that increases
with monster level. So a level 1 or 2 monster doesn’t suffer from this at all,
but a level 25 epic threat will hit like a feather pillow when it should be
hitting like a speeding truck.</p>

<p>If you’re preparing a 4e adventure and you need to fix a MM2 stat block
yourself, the famous <a href="http://blogofholding.com/?p=512">Monster Manual 3 on a Business Card</a> post from Blog of
Holding has a wonderful summary of the definitive formulas, which you get in a
longer form in one of the DMG update PDFs that WotC published back in the day.</p>

<p>An even quicker fix is to add half the monster’s level to all of its damage
rolls, as outlined in this <a href="http://blogofholding.com/?p=782">other Blog of Holding</a> post. So, for example, add
+5 to all damage rolls for a level 10 monster. This should get you close enough
to the “correct” figures.</p>
