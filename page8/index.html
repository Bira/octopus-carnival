<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Cloud rays look like gigantic flying stingrays, and are among some of the rarest
and most majestic specimens of Athasian fauna. They float in from the Sea of
Silt to feed or rest, and despite their prodigious size they’re rarely dangerous
unless bothered.</p>

<p>These creatures subsist mostly on psychic, entropic, and magical energy, so they
only need a comparatively tiny amount of physical food to keep going. They land
on the ground to sleep, covering themselves in sand and debris for
camouflage. There are many stories about travelers who pitched their tents on a
nice spot of high ground only to later find themselves desperately clinging to
the back of a cloud ray when the creature took flight.</p>

<p>Cloud rays dream of distant places when they sleep, and sometimes they disappear
to those places instead of taking flight the usual way. When threatened, the
creature can consciously tap into this ability to teleport short distances.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Cloud Rays are Elemental Beasts, whose size varies depending on their age. They
can crawl on the ground at speed 4 and fly at Speed 12 with Hover
capability. They have an affinity for storms, with Resist 15 Lightning and
Thunder.</p>

<p>We’re going through the entries here in increasing order of level, which is the
reverse of what the book does.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-ray-pup">Cloud Ray Pup</h3>

<p>This young individual is Large, translucent, and relatively delicate for its
size. It’s a Level 21 Minion Skirmisher. Pups fly around in clusters near other
creatures that can provide them with food - most commonly cloud ray elders, but
sometimes other aerial predators that tend to leave lots of left-overs. If their
intended prey is still moving, they sting it until it stops, and then set down
to eat.</p>

<p>Their <strong>sting</strong> is Reach 3 and deals thunder damage. They can employ it as part
of a <strong>Gliding Attack</strong> that lets them move their speed and make the attack at
any point along the way. They don’t provoke opportunity attacks when moving away
from the target of their sting.</p>

<p>As a minion, a single hit will take the pup down, but it can use <strong>Dream
Resurgence</strong> once per encounter to remove itself from play when it reaches 0 HP
and reappear at the start of its next turn within 10 squares, with its 1 HP
restored. It will probably use this opportunity to run away if nothing is
forcing it to stay, so the PCs don’t need to feel bad about giving this
beautiful creature a good whack to get it to bother someone else.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-ray-adult">Cloud Ray Adult</h3>

<p>Adults cruise the skies continuously, only descending to rest or to attack
land-bound prey. Sure, it eats little for its size, but for a Huge creature that
can still mean its infrequent meals consist of a whole person or similarly sized
animal. Adults are Level 23 Elite Skirmishers with 424 HP.</p>

<p>The adult has a much stronger version of the pup’s <strong>Sting</strong>, with Reach 4. It
can also use a Reach 1 <strong>bite</strong> that deals more damage and grabs the
target. Targets grabbed by the bite have a -4 to their escape rolls, which have
escape DCs of 34 for Athletics and 36 for Acrobatics. The ray can grab at most
one target like this. The <strong>Unhindered</strong> trait lets the cloud ray pull the
victim along when it moves. Either of these attacks can be used as part of
<strong>Gliding Attack</strong>, which lets it attack twice during the movement and otherwise
works like the pup’s version.</p>

<p>A ray that finds itself surrounded can use <strong>Wing Storm</strong> (Close Burst 3
vs. Fort, recharge 5+) to deal thunder damage and push targets 3 squares on a
hit, also knocking them prone. This creates a lightly obscured zone that lasts
for a turn, from all the dust it kicks up.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, while bloodied, the ray can use <strong>Dream Flight</strong> to teleport
15 squares, carrying its grabbed victim with it if it has one. It makes Close
Burst 2 attack vs. Fortitude on arrival, dazing an slowing those it hits.</p>

<p>A grabbed victim can be attacked with further bite attacks and with <strong>Crush</strong>, a
minor action attack vs. Fortitude that deals as much damage as the bite.</p>

<p>An adult on the hunt will try to grab its chosen prey and fly away, biting and
crushing the victim until it’s dead. If their prey proves too feisty, they’ll
drop it from a great height to soften it up, and then grab it again. Repeat
until done.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-ray-elder">Cloud Ray Elder</h3>

<p>This majestic Gargantuan beast is a Level 25 Solo Controller, on par with elder
dragons from other worlds. Its control over storms lets it project an aura (3)
of <strong>Undulating Winds</strong>, which deals 15 thunder damage to enemies that start
their turns inside and lets the elder slide them 3 squares to another square
within the aura.</p>

<p>Also, its <strong>Flat Body</strong> lets other creatures enter and occupy the elder’s
space - they’re standing on top of the ray! This means it’s equal parts enemy
and terrain during a fight. If it took flight because you tried to camp on its
back, it will be the <em>only</em> terrain for the fight.</p>

<p>Obviously if you’re on top of the ray, you’re also inside its aura, so it will
try to slide you off its back. This follows the rules for forced movement into
hazardous terrain, so you get a save to grab on before you tumble to the
ground. If you pass, you end up prone at the ray’s edge.</p>

<p>The elder’s is Reach 5 <strong>Sting</strong> deals immediate and ongoing thunder damage
(save ends). Its favorite attack enhances the sting with magic for a <strong>Thunder
Lash</strong>, which deals physical damage to its primary target and triggers a
secondary close burst 5 centered on that target that deals thunder damage to all
enemies it hits and pushes then 3 squares. On a miss it deals half damage.</p>

<p>It’s also large enough that its bite upgrades to <strong>Scooping Bite</strong>: this is a
Close Blast 5 instead of a melee attack, and it can grab up to three targets it
hits. <strong>Unhindered</strong> is here and lets the elder fly away with its mouthful of
victims. <strong>Gliding Menace</strong> works like Gliding Attack, but lets the elder
specifically use Thunder Lash and Scooping Bite as its two flyby attacks.</p>

<p>Like the adult, the elder can <strong>Crush</strong> its grabbed victims with a minor
action. Fortunately they don’t have penalties on their escape rolls, but the
base DCs are higher since the elder is higher level.</p>

<p>If bloodied, the elder uses <strong>Dream Flight</strong> to teleport away. It works just
like the adult’s version, but the daze upgrades to Stunned on the first failed
save and Unconscious on the second.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Cloud Rays are almost always only found together with other cloud rays, with a
flock of pups following a group of adults or a single elder around. They’re not
sapient but I think they’re smart enough not to attack heavily armed PCs without
provocation. Encounters are more likely to start when a PC runs into a ray at
rest, and even then a fight is not certain.</p>

<p>I imagine you can have a good adventure about PCs trying to prevent another
armed group from killing cloud rays, and in this case the creatures would <em>not</em>
be smart enough to distinguish the PCs from the hunters if a fight broke out.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The cilops (not to be confused with the cyclops) is the Darker and Sunnier
version of Ye Olde Giante Centipede. That means it’s larger, spikier, and has
psychic powers. Their name comes from the huge single mammal-like eye they have
instead of the more usual compound eyes you find in arthropods.</p>

<p>Unlike other monstrous centipedes, the bite of the cilops is not venomous. The
touch of its antennae, however, can psychically paralyze victims or muddle their
minds. They can also psychically track victims over short distances - it’s very
hard to hide from these things once they caught your scent.</p>

<p>In the wild, cilopses gather in the same places you can find mundane
centipedes - any area where there’s a reasonable amount of shade and
water. You’re more likely to find them <em>outside</em> of the wild, however, as
Templar patrols from every city love to use trained cilopses as both trackers
and attack animals.</p>

<p>Some templars or sorcerer-kings are also fond of raising particularly large and
vicious specimens and letting them loose on the city to wreak some havoc and
terrorize the population into compliance.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Cilopses are Large Natural Beasts. They have Darkvision, some sort of antenna
power that varies with the stat block, and the signature power <strong>Follow Psychic
Trail</strong>. This is a minor-action encounter power that lets them choose a creature
they can see. Until the end of the encounter that creature grants combat
advantage to the cilops, and cannot hide from it.</p>

<p>The combat advantage is pretty useful during a fight, but remember that a skill
challenge to run away from a cilops-equipped patrol is also an encounter. Don’t
let they catch your scent!</p>

<h3 id="cilops-creeper">Cilops Creeper</h3>

<p>A typical specimen such as one might find in the wild, or accompanying a templar
strike force. It’s a Level 5 Skirmisher with 60 HP. It has ground and climb
speeds of 7, and Resist 5 Psychic.</p>

<p>All of the creeper’s attacks deal 1d6 extra damage if it has <strong>Combat
Advantage</strong>, which is yet another reason for not letting it track you. Its basic
<strong>bite</strong> damages on a hit and lets the creeper shift 2 squares as an
effect. Once per encounter it can use its <strong>Paralyzing Antennae</strong> against a
creature granting combat advantage to it, targetting Fortitude. On a hit this
damages, dazes, and immobilizes the target for a turn.</p>

<p>Creepers really want to start tracking a specific PC as soon as the fight
starts, and then focus fire on their chosen victim starting with an antennae
attack and then proceeding to spam the bite.</p>

<h3 id="cilops-stalker">Cilops Stalker</h3>

<p>A chunky terror weapon, the Stalker is a Level 7 Elite Skirmisher with 154
HP. It’s slower and less agile than the Creeper, with a ground speed of only 6
and no climb speed or psychic resistance. However, it makes up for that in bulk.</p>

<p>The Stalker’s <strong>pincers</strong> have the same bonus against targets granting CA, and
its <strong>Sudden Rush</strong> maneuver (recharge 5+) is excellent against tight
formations. It allows the Stalker to shift its speed and move through enemies
space during this shift. Whenever it does so, it makes a melee attack vs. the
enemy’s Reflex, dealing heavy damage and knocking prone on a hit.</p>

<p>It can still only <strong>Follow Psychic Trail</strong> once per encounter, but unlike the
Creeper it can use its Reach 2 <strong>Dazing Antennae</strong> once per round with no
targeting restrictions. This does lightning damage equivalent to the bite on a
hit, and dazes for a turn.</p>

<p>The Stalker also wants to track and focus on one target, and Sudden Rush lets it
reach that target even through the party’s defender front line.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, you’re much more likely to encounter these things being used
as trackers and attack animals by templars than to meet them in their natural
habitats. If you do meet them in the wild, they’re likely to be accompanied by
other varieties of giant bug, or by swarms of smaller ones.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they’re giant centipedes with a bit more character, and I imagine
they can get pretty annoying when paired with other teammates that specialize in
tying PCs down and preventing them from helping the cilops’ chosen victim.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Chathrangs are big carnivorous tortoises with built-in anti-air artillery. The
many spiny protusions on their shells are tubes that can spit out sticky
envenomed quills, with or without a tether that lets them reel in their
catch. Their usual hunting method is to hide in an oasis amid natural reeds or
other plants, wait for small birds or large insects to fly overhead, and shoot
them.</p>

<p>If no suitable flying critters are present, they’ll go for land-based prey. They
tend to become too enthusiastic or desperate at these times, and might try to
reel in something they can’t handle. Like a PC, for example.</p>

<p>Chathrangs usually live and travel in groups of about three. They don’t have a
lot of combat ability outside of their one neat trick, so it’s common for them
to enter symbiotic relationships with other creatures to share prey in exchange
for a bit more protection. When hurt, they behave like other tortoises and hide
inside their shells.</p>

<p>Charthrangs are impossible to train, but some people keep them around to “milk”
their venom. If a battle against their keepers ends up bursting into the
charthrang enclosure, the creatures will follow their instincts.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>These critters are Medium Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag and a stately
ground speed of 4. They’re Level 9 Artillery with 81 HP, so I guess even a
monster described as “relatively weak” rates high-Heroic stats in this world.</p>

<p>The creature’s <strong>Spiny Shell</strong> acts as an aura (1) that deals 5 damage to anyone
who starts their turn inside, but they charthrang doesn’t really want PCs to get
that close. Instead, it wants to stay far away and shoot its Range 20 <strong>spine
shots</strong>, which do poison damage on a hit. The beast can increase its rate of
fire and use a <strong>Spine Volley</strong> instead, attacking two targets with one action.</p>

<p>Attaching a sticky strand to a spine turns it into the <strong>Poisoned Tether</strong>
attack, which does the same damage and immobilizes the target. While immobilized
by this attack, the target cannot be pushed, pulled, or slid by anything other
than the <strong>Reel In</strong> minor action, which pulls it 5 squares. Escape requires
either passing a save as normal, or teleporting.</p>

<p>If the charthrang is damaged by an attack, it can <strong>retreat into its shell</strong> as
a reaction. Until the end of its next turn it’s slowed, can’t attack, gains a +5
to AC, and doubles the damage done by its aura.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Aside from the standard encounter disposition mentioned in the lore, chatharangs
are also very amenable to reskinning. If you read the Cactus entry and felt that
you needed cactus artillery to complement the lurkers, you can just replace
Reptile with Plant on the chathrang stat block and call it a day. Describe them
as big spherical cacti that move by rolling around and otherwise behave the
same.</p>

<p>The mechanics are interesting. Range 20 is a lot! A cluster of three of these
machine-gun tortoises can sit very far back behind a line of 2-4 soldiers or
brutes and wreak havoc on the PCs by directly targeting their squishies, and
reeling them towards Team Monster’s frontline. Multiple charthrangs can stick
their tethers to the same PC and alternate their use of Reel In to bring the
victim closer that much faster, too.</p>

<p>That is, of course, if the GM plays them smart. This is absolutely not required,
as these are simple animals with a reputation for trying to catch things too
dangerous for them to handle.</p>

<p>Still… anti-air tortoises. What a world.</p>

<p>Cacti are an important part of the Athasian ecosystem, and their natural water
collection mechanisms are often vital to allow people to survive in its
deserts. But in Dark Sun, sometimes the cactus drinks you.</p>

<p>This entry presents two D&amp;D Plant Monsters with that Darker and Sunnier edge to
them.</p>

<h2 id="zombie-cactus">Zombie Cactus</h2>

<p>One of the most prized cactus species in Athas is the Flowering Oasis Cactus, a
beautiful plant whose sweet fruit can instantly satisfy someone’s hunger or
thirst. Finding one of those out in the desert can be a real lifesaver.</p>

<p>The Zombie Cactus takes advantage of this by looking exactly like a Flowering
Oasis Cactus to draw its victims in. Its fruit is just as sweet, but it’s filled
with mind-affecting poison nectar that dominates those who eat it. If the victim
is too wary to eat, the cactus can release a cloud of spores that has the same
effect before uncoiling its tendrils to deal with anyone still free. People
killed while under the cactus’ influence immediately raise as zombie cactus
thralls.</p>

<p>All of this is way too evil to be a coincidence. Sages believe zombie cacti are
an engineered bioweapon, the work of slavers employing psychic powers and
defiling magic. The creatures proved too uncontrollable to be used as tools, and
enough escaped their creators to take root in the wild.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Zombie Cacti are Large Natural Magical Beasts with the Plant tag. Yes, they’re
intelligent. They’re also Level 11 Elite Lurkers with 182 HP, Tremorsense 10,
and a ground speed of 2 with Earth Walk. Yes, they’re ambulatory.</p>

<p>You’ll usually find the cactus in its <strong>Innocuous Form</strong>, which is nearly
identical to a flowering oasis cactus (Nature DC 27 to notice the
difference). It can do nothing in this state except assume its true form as a
minor action. While disguised, the cactus has Resist 15 all and
Regeneration 5. Wearing the disguise again takes a standard action.</p>

<p>A disguised cactus is still dangerous because of its <strong>Poison Fruit</strong>, described
as a passive trait. It will have between four and eight of these, which can be
eaten by another character as a minor action. Anyone who eats them is dominated
by the cactus (save ends). A dominated victim who is reduced to 0 HP can no
longer save against this. Note there’s no attack roll here - eat the fruit, get
dominated, period.</p>

<p>Once the jig is up, the cactus uncoils and releases a cloud of <strong>Dominating
Spores</strong> (close burst 3 vs. will), which has the same effect as the fruit on a
hit. The burst also creates a spore-filled zone that inflicts -5 to saves
against zombie cactus domination for a turn. This power recharges when the
cactus uses Innocuous Form, giving us our “lurker loop” (breathe out, breathe
in).</p>

<p>Once enough people are dominated, the cactus will use its <strong>Tendrils</strong>, which do
standard damage and an additional ongoing 10 necrotic (save ends) if the target
is dominated by the cactus. <strong>Lashing Tendrils</strong> lets it attack two different
targets with this attack.</p>

<p>When someone dominated by the cactus dies, they become a Zombie Cactus Thrall at
the start of their next turn. This zombie is a Level 11 Minion Brute. It can
<strong>Slam</strong> and <strong>Grab</strong> for the same amount of damage, but it prefers the later
because it can pull grabbed targets along with itself when it moves (probably
closer to the cactus). When it drops to 0 HP, it releases a <strong>Spore Burst</strong> in a
Close Burst 1 that has the same attack bonus and effects as the cactus’ cloud!</p>

<p>If the PCs want to resurrect a victim of the cactus, they must destroy the
corresponding thrall first. After that, the usual rituals can be applied.</p>

<h2 id="hunter-cactus">Hunter Cactus</h2>

<p>These aren’t engineered bioweapons. They’re “merely” fast, aggressive predators
that pose as innocent plants and use their venomous spines to drain the blood of
their prey.</p>

<p>A Hunter Cactus is a Large Natural Magical Beast with the Plant tag, and a Level
12 Lurker with 82 HP. It has Tremorsense 20 and a ground speed of <em>six</em>.</p>

<p>When the hunter cactus stands still, it takes a DC28 Nature check to realize
it’s not a mundane plant. It will probably begin its attack with a <strong>Spine
Burst</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Reflex, recharge 5+). It deals no damage right away,
but inflicts 20 ongoing poison damage and blindness (save ends both)! From then
on it will use its <strong>Feeding Spine</strong> on any blinded creatures, damaging and
grabbing them on a hit. It can grab up to two creatures this way. A minor action
lets it sustain all grabs and auto-damage the grabbed creatures.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the cactus cannot run away with grabbed creatures, so it will stand
its ground and fight any remaining foes with <strong>Slams</strong> that deal standard damage
and ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends). If the cactus is hit while it has a
creature grabbed, the <strong>Psychic Feedback</strong> reaction deals psychic damage to the
victim equal to the damage the cactus just took.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Zombie cacti are found in the wild alone or in pairs, surrounded by thralls who
rise up to fight when the cactus reveals itself. Note they are <em>magical beasts</em>,
and therefore capable of forming alliances with other creatures. Commonly, that
will be a wild predator who they train to draw victims to the cactus so they can
share the spoils. Sometimes other people will coerce a zombie cactus into
service, a fate it will always try to escape.</p>

<p>Hunter cacti are more amenable to cooperation with humanoids, who can easily
train them to attack only designated targets in exchange for a regular supply of
food. In these cases they will be found alongside other guardians.</p>

<p>These are neat, and very nasty. Cactus drinks you indeed.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>This entry goes on and on about how stupid brohgs are, but I think that’s
terribly unfair to them. They’re some of the nicest people we’ve met in this
reading so far.</p>

<p>These four-armed giant-kin wander the wastes in small nomadic bands that
occasionally cross paths to trade gossip and partners. They’re extremely skilled
at surviving the environment in Athas, taking only what they need and leaving
little trace of their passage. Their strong primal magic tradition helps them
with this.</p>

<p>Of course, being both big and relatively peaceful makes them frequent targets
for the many odious slaver organizations in this setting, so they often end up
captured and put to work as heavy laborers, muscle, or gladiators. Enslaved
brohg who manage to break free often seek employment as mercenaries.</p>

<p>Brohgs have both an innate ability to sense arcane magic, and an intense
cultural distrust of it, as they associate all arcane magic with defiling and
believe it to be cursed. Very rarely, a brohg will be born with innate arcane
potential (like a PC sorcerer). These individuals end up exiled from their
communities, as they’re believed to be hosts to “evil spirits” and destined to
bring disaster. Left to fend for themselves with no support, they often end up
creating a self-fulfilling prophecy scenario and becoming cruel defilers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Brohgs are Large Natural Humanoids with the Giant tag. They move at a relatively
slow speed of 6, and have low-light vision. They have four arms and are
ambidexterous, but that doesn’t translate into a specific trait in their stat
blocks - each one has different abilities related to training.</p>

<h3 id="brohg-hurler">Brohg Hurler</h3>

<p>Hurlers are civilians without a lot of combat training, but they get by just
fine by throwing stuff really far away, be that stuff boulders or
enemies. They’re Level 10 Artillery with 82 HP.</p>

<p>Their basic Reach 2 <strong>Slam</strong> attack lets them grab the target on a hit, which is
hilarious because they can then use <strong>Hurl Away</strong> to throw them 10 squares at
another creature, further damaging the “ammunition” as an effect and making a
ranged attack against the second target. For rules purposes, this counts as a
push that leaves the hurled creature adjacent to the second target.</p>

<p>If no one’s stupid enough to get within arm’s reach of a hurler, they can hurl a
<strong>rock</strong> instead, which does similar damage, pushes the target 2 squares, and
knocks it prone.</p>

<h3 id="brohg-warrior">Brohg Warrior</h3>

<p>This is what a trained brohg combatant looks like. When a brohg community is
under attack, warriors step up to cover their retreat. This could also represent
an enslaved or mercenary brohg working for someone else. Warriors are armed with
2 spears, a shield, and a hand kept free to throw rocks. They’re Level 10 Elite
Soldiers with 212 HP.</p>

<p>They can attack with a <strong>spear</strong> that marks for a turn or a thrown <strong>rock</strong> that
knocks prone, and <strong>Double Attack</strong> lets them do that twice in an action in any
combination.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Brohg Taunt</strong> ability is a minor action that lets them mark everyone in
a Close Burst 2, and recharges when they’re bloodied. If a marked enemy within 2
squares moves, the brohg can use <strong>Battle Alacrity</strong> to get a free attack on
them that does light damage and lets then shift 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="brohg-renegade">Brohg Renegade</h3>

<p>One of those banished sorcerers who went all in on defiling magic, and now
wanders alone or at the head of a villainous band, plotting to increase his
power. The Renegade is a Level 13 Solo Controller with 512 HP.</p>

<p>This defiler knows an <strong>Arcane Secret</strong> that lets them roll saves against daze
or stun effects both at the start and end of its turn, even if that effect
doesn’t allow a save (i.e., by having a fixed duration instead). Its <strong>dagger</strong>
basic attack is a <em>minor</em> action that does normal damage, and a little bit of
extra force damage if the target doesn’t end their next turn at least two
squares away from the renegade.</p>

<p>Its standard actions are all spells.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Entropy Belt</strong> (ranged 10 vs. will) targets one to three creatures, dealing
psychic damage and pushing 3 squares on a hit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defiling Vortex</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Fort, recharges when bloodied) deals no
damage on a hit, but instead knocks targets prone and weakens then (save
ends). Missed enemies take necrotic damage. At the end of all this, the
renegade gains 5 temp HP for every target it hit with the power.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defiling Blast</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Ref, recharge 5+) does necrotic damage
and dazes (save ends). The renegade gains a +4 to all damage while any target
remains dazed by this power.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And as it suits a solo, we also get a ton of triggered actions. The renegade has
the same <strong>Variable Resistance</strong> as a demon, usable 2 times per encounter. To
refresh our memories: the value of this resistance is 10, and when the renegade
takes elemental damage it can switch the resistance to resist that damage type
as a free action, up to the encounter limit, when the resistance retains its
final type.</p>

<p>If an enemy hits the renegade while granting combat advantage to it, the
renegade can cast a <strong>Wrath Sphere</strong> (close burst 1 vs. Fort) against that
enemy, dealing force damage and pushing it 2 squares on a hit. And when the
renegade is first bloodied, <strong>Bloodied Defiling</strong> triggers to let it immediately
recharge and use Defiling Blast again.</p>

<p>That’s a lot of stuff, but that’s a solo for you. Almost dragon-like, this one.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Free broghs have no reason to quarrel with PCs unless provoked, and if that
happens the warriors will cover the retreat of the rest of the group while
hurlers help from further away. They might also keep several of the hardy beasts
described in this book, and they might help in a fight too.</p>

<p>Enslaved or mercenary individuals might be found in mixed sapient encounter
groups. Renegade defilers will often be <em>leading</em> such a villain group. A single
renegade is a nice “welcome to paragon tier” boss fight. One plus some
lieutenants makes for a nice set piece battle for mid-paragon heroes.</p>

<p>I like their mechanics and I like parts of their lore, but as I already
mentioned I don’t like the way the book keeps saying how brohgs are stupid and
simple-minded, and how it manages to make them superstitious despite living in a
D&amp;D world and having their own working magical tradition. Distrusting arcane
magic in Dark Sun is sensible, but having the brohgs do it because they falsely
believe it’s a curse from evil spirits is a step too far in my opinion.</p>
