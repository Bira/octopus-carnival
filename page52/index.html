<p>Kuo-toa made their 4e debut in the Monster Manual, and would get a MV style
upgrade in Dungeon 193. This entry gives us extra stat blocks that don’t overlap
with either, even though it came out months before the Dungeon update.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Kuo-Toa basic lore remains the same. They’re the spear-wielding fish people that
live in the Underdark and worship aboleths and other aberrant entities. Their
priests, known as whips, are their absolute rulers, and discipline is enforced
by individuals known as monitors.</p>

<p>This entry adds that whips and monitors are able to force their underlings to
follow a coherent combat strategy even though those underlings tend to be very
mentally unstable. If these leaders fall before their underlings, the group’s
tactics will become a lot more erratic. Some will run, some will go berserk, and
so on.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>All kuo-toa in this entry have ground and swim speeds of 6. They are Aquatic and
have Darkvision. Their signature ability is Slick Maneuver, a move action that
can be used when they’re adjacent to an enemy and allows them to shift 3
squares, though they must end the move still adjacent to the enemy.</p>

<h3 id="kuo-toa-mad-one">Kuo-Toa Mad One</h3>

<p>As you can guess from the name, Mad Ones are unstable even by the standards of
other kuo-toa. They’re afflicted by a form of supernatural insanity that
originates in the Far Realm and is contagious. They hang around old ruins and
temples, worshipping and guarding ancient artifacts far away from the rest of
their society. If one of these is stolen, they’ll give chase to punish the
thieves and recover the relic.</p>

<p>Mad Ones are Level 12 Minion Skirmishers, and notably lack Slick
Maneuver. Instead, they have an aura (1) of <strong>Spreading Madness</strong> that gives all
enemies inside 5 Vulnerability to psychic damage. Their <strong>Claw</strong> attacks damage
and allow them to shift 1 square on a hit. They can also release a <strong>Psychic
Scream</strong> in a Close Blast 3. It deals a small amount of psychic damage, though
that gets a boost from Spreading Madness.</p>

<h3 id="kuo-toa-drowner">Kuo-Toa Drowner</h3>

<p>Drowners specialize on raiding ships and dragging their crews to a watery
doom. They wield hooks and barbed nets in combat.</p>

<p>Drowners are Level 14 Soldiers with 137 HP. Their <strong>hooks</strong> can be used for
basic attacks and for a <strong>Dredging Hook</strong> maneuver that does the same damage as
a basic attack and slides the target 3 squares to another square adjacent to the
kuo-toa. Combined with Slick Maneuver, this makes the process of dragging a
victim overboard into a sort of spiral dance.</p>

<p>The <strong>Barbed Net</strong> can be thrown as a ranged attack vs. Reflex. It deals a bit
less damage than the hook, and if the target willingly moves in their next turn
they take extra damage. Drowners carry 4 of these nets each.</p>

<h3 id="kuo-toa-lash">Kuo-Toa Lash</h3>

<p>Lashes are a caste of lesser priests, subservient to the whips and responsible
for overseeing sacrifices. This includes leading raids to acquire victims. They
fight with tridents and a combination of lightning and water-based magic.</p>

<p>Lashes are Level 15 Artillery with 115 HP. They can use their <strong>tridents</strong> in
melee or throw them in a <strong>Lightning Trident</strong> attack that’s stronger, deals
lightning damage, and causes the weapon to return to the lash. Its main
disadvantage is that the range on this attack is only 3/6.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Fill Lungs</strong> spell reaches a lot farther. It targets Fortitude, does
physical damage, and inflicts ongoing 5 damage. It’s also very scary.</p>

<p>They can also use a <strong>Forked Lightning</strong> spell that works as a lightning-based
fireball that also blinds on a hit. This recharges whey they’re first bloodied,
or when they reduce an enemy to 0 HP.</p>

<h3 id="kuo-toa-cutter">Kuo-Toa Cutter</h3>

<p>Cutters are classic skirmishers, trained to slip through enemy frontlines and
stab their squishies with serrated daggers. They’re Level 16 Skirmishers with
151 HP.</p>

<p>The <strong>barbed dagger</strong> does standard damage for their level, and they can also
use it in a <strong>Crippling Strike</strong> that does less damage but inflicts slowness and
ongoing 10 damage (save ends). If someone misses them with a melee attack, the
cutter can shift 4 squares and use Barbed Dagger as a reaction.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These go well with the Dungeon 193 updated kuo-toa, and if you’re already using
those then you’ll like these ones. No big lore changes here, but the stat blocks
are cool enough.</p>

<p>Krakens have been in the game since AD&amp;D, but here they get some extra lore.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>At the beginning of time, long before the creation of the first mortals, the
Krakens escaped from the Far Realm and entered the middle world and the Astral
Sea, trailing the debris of other broken worlds behind them.</p>

<p>They had a good time for a while, but then a great cataclysm (perhaps the Dawn
War) scattered them. In our narrative present most of the surviving krakens are
hidden in the deepest trenches of the middle world’s oceans, or slumbering in
forgotten corners of the Astral. Every once in a while, though, one of them will
leave these dark holes and once again wreak havoc.</p>

<p>These creatures are extremely intelligent, though their mentalities are very
alien to mortals. They’re hostile to mortal sapients for incomprehensible
reasons, and are drawn to wherever large groups of sapient minds can be
found. When they emerge, groups of cultists soon gather around them, composed
both of mortal worshippers and aberrant creatures. Krakens are more than smart
enough to command and use these cults to help fulfill their destructive goals.</p>

<p>So yeah, Krakens are Great Old Ones.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>We have two varieties of kraken here. One is more geared towards the classic
“giant squid attacks ship” scenario, and the other leans more on the Great Old
One aesthetic. Both are Gargantuan Aberrant Magical Beasts.</p>

<h3 id="sea-kraken">Sea Kraken</h3>

<p>A kraken that lives in the seas of the middle world. It is said that terrible
storms follow in their wake. They love to attack ships, and any vessel grabbed
by a Sea Kraken is likely doomed unless it happens to be transporting a party of
particularly badass adventurers.</p>

<p>Sea Krakens are Level 10 Solo Soldiers with 432 HP, which makes them a bit
lower-level than I anticipated given their general lore. They have darkvision, a
ground speed of 6, and a swim speed of 10. I think this makes them faster in
water than most ships.</p>

<p>Sea Krakens are obviously <strong>Aquatic</strong>, which means they can breathe underwater
and gain a +2 attack bonus against non-aquatic creatures fighting them in the
water. They also have <strong>Threatening Reach</strong> 3. As you might guess, this is a
grabby monster. Escaping its grabs requires a DC 26 Athletics or DC 22 Acrobatis
check.</p>

<p>The kraken’s basic attack involves its <strong>Crushing Tentacles</strong>, which are
Reach 3. They damage and grab on a hit, and the kraken can have up to 8
creatures grabbed by this attack. The monster can spend a minor action to
sustain all of its grabs and deal an automatic 5 damage to all victims.</p>

<p><strong>Devourer of Ships</strong> is a literal anti-vehicle attack - it can only target
vehicles, and it’s what the beast uses to coil around a ship. It deals heavy
damage to the target ship and restrains it while the kraken remains within 3
squares of it. While restrained, the ship takes 20 damage at the start of the
target’s turn. Its pilot can spend a Standard action to give the ship a saving
throw, and if it passes it escapes the grab.</p>

<p>And don’t worry, krakens don’t have to split their attention between a ship and
its crew. <strong>Coils of Doom</strong> is an at-will power that allows them to use Crushing
Tentacles twice and Devourer of Ships once with a single action.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can also use an ability named <strong>Wavewrack</strong> to create a
zone in a Close Burst 3 around themselves. This zone is difficult terrain. When
an enemy starts their turn inside, they take 5 damage and are slid 2
squares. The Kraken can spend a minor action to slide this zone up to 3
squares. Do note that a Close Burst 3 around a Gargantuan creature is <em>much</em>
larger than one around a Medium creature.</p>

<p>Aside from moving the zone, the kraken can spend minor actions to activate any
of the following abilities. <strong>Fatal Plunge</strong> is an attack against a grabbed
creature that deals light damage and slides the target 3 squares. As the name
implies, this can allow the kraken to drag them <em>underwater</em>. It can also
<strong>Fling</strong> a grabbed creature, sliding them adjacent to another creature and
making a lightly-damaging attack against both. This ends the grab. And finally,
it can shoot <strong>Venom Bolts</strong> that deal poison damage and blind (save ends).</p>

<p>We’re not done yet! If a grabbed creature damages the kraken, the monster can
use <strong>Vengeful Constriction</strong> as a reaction to deal 5 automatic damage to every
creature it’s grabbing.</p>

<h3 id="astral-kraken">Astral Kraken</h3>

<p>Astral Krakens are “sea monsters” in the same way the Astral is a “sea”. Their
bodies are made of stars and shadow, their eyes two black lightless
voids. Madness precedes them and follows in their wake. You might say they’re
closer to their original forms than the sea kraken, as they never had to
acclimate to the middle world. You know how some people worship Aboleths as
god-like beings older than time? I bet Aboleths worship astral krakens in the
same way.</p>

<p>Astral Krakens are Level 25 Solo Controllers with 925 HP, putting them in the
same “weight class” as godforged and primordial colossi, divine and demonic
exarchs, and most ancient dragons. It takes the sea kraken chassis and adds
madness-themed abilities on top. It has a flight speed of 10, and
Blindsight 20. Invisibility won’t save you.</p>

<p>The kraken’s melee attacks have Threatening Reach 4. Its <strong>Tentacles From
Beyond</strong> work like the sea kraken’s, damaging and grabbing. The escape DC is 41
for Athletics, and 37 for Acrobatics. Sustaining the grab deals 15 psychic
damage to all victims.</p>

<p><strong>Absorb Psyche</strong> targets all grabbed victims at once, attacking Will and
dealing psychic damage. A hit also grants the Kraken a +5 bonus to attack with
Touch of Madness (below) <em>for the rest of the encounter</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Touch of Madness</strong> targets a single creature’s Will. It does no damage, but it
forces the target to use its highest-level encounter power against another
target of the Kraken’s choice. This happens even if the power was already
expended, and doesn’t expend the power if it hasn’t.</p>

<p><strong>Devourer of Ships</strong> is here too, and works much like the Sea Kraken
version. Despite its higher accuracy, it deals exactly the same damage. I guess
this makes sense, since a ship’s HP varies less than a PC’s as level goes up.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the astral kraken can release a <strong>Nullifying Pulse</strong> in a
Close Blast 4. This non-damaging attack targets Will and dazes (save ends) on a
hit. There are no other minor action attacks, but it doesn’t <em>need</em> any more
with such a powerful multi-daze at its disposal.</p>

<p>Its triggered actions are pretty scary too! When someone misses the kraken,
they’re forced to <strong>Behold the Horror</strong>. This is a reaction attack that targets
Will, deals psychic damage, and dominates for a turn. Luckily it can only happen
at most once per round, since it’s a reaction.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, when the kraken is first bloodied, it lets out a <strong>Psychic
Scream</strong>, which covers a large enough area (Close Burst 10!) that it’s likely
to target every enemy. This attacks Will, and on a hit it deals psychic damage
and stuns (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>When it’s time to release the kraken, these two will not disappoint.</p>

<p>Sea krakens have a lot of straightforward multi-attack capability, and they’re
really hard to shake from your ship once they grab on. If the ship manages to
escape, they don’t have to divert their attention from the crew to grab the
vessel again.</p>

<p>The astral kraken’s multi-attack capability is less straightforward than the sea
kraken’s, but it has excellent action denial, and can be terrifying if you give
it time to set things up properly.</p>

<p>Both monsters don’t seem to have much defense against being dazed or stunned
other than the standard +5 solo bonus to saves, so doing that is a good way to
neutralize their firepower. If your party is heavy on the action denial powers,
you can make things harder for them by adding a sprinkling of cultist minions
and a leader-type that can grant them extra saves.</p>

<p>I believe jackalweres are another monster from the AD&amp;D days, but this time
around they get a new backstory.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The middle world was a ver dangerous place back during the Dawn War. Its lands
were constantly ravaged by splash damage and near-misses from the cosmic
struggle between gods and primordials. It was not unusual for ancient mortals to
go to war with each other and with the wildlife to secure shelter and food.</p>

<p>One of these wars was between an ancient human people and a nation of primal
jackals - sapient magical beasts that looked like mundane animals. The jackals
lost badly and were almost driven to extinction. The few survivors howled their
rage and grief to the skies, and to their surprise something answered. The
primal spirit known as the Dark Sister hear their cries and gave them her gifts,
turning them into the first jackalweres. These gifts give jackalweres the
ability to assume human form. Not a single specific human form, like a
lycanthrope, but <em>any</em> human form, like a doppelganger.</p>

<p>Present-day jackalweres organize themselves into small nomadic packs. Some roam
and hunt like their distant ancestors did, staying mostly in their natural
animal form. Many of them, however, still carry those ancestors’ grudges against
humanity and treat them as prey. They use their shapechanging powers to spy on
human communities at the edge of the wilderness and to disable their defenses
before launching a devastating raid with the goal of killing everyone. And once
someone comes in to investigate the carnage it’s not uncommon for them to find a
party of “adventurers” doing the same. These adventurers are, of course, the
jackalweres who were responsible for the raid and who stuck around to kill the
responders.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Jackalweres are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Shapechanger keyword. Their
signature ability is <strong>Change Shape</strong>, which allows them to take the form of a
Medium jackal or that of a human. Their clothing, armor, and possessions do not
change, which means they must either have stashes of gear to don after taking
human form, or they must take someone’s place. They can disguise themselves as
any individual they’ve seen before, and the DC for seeing through this is 26 -
very high for their level.</p>

<p>Jackalweres have Speed 6, the same as a human.</p>

<h3 id="jackalwere-bravo">Jackalwere Bravo</h3>

<p>Bravos are the younger members of a pack. They’re eager to prove themselves in
battle, but their elders have them acting as servants and menial laborers most
of the time. When they’re given orders to fight, they do so with enthusiasm and
release all of their pent-up anger.</p>

<p>Bravos are Level 3 Brutes with 56 HP. The <strong>Bravo’s Fury</strong> trait gives them 1d6
bonus damage against dazed, helpless, or prone creatures. In human form, they
fight with <strong>Falchions</strong>, which are High-Crit weapons. In jackal form, they
<strong>bite</strong>, which does a bit less damage but knocks prone on a hit. Their
<strong>Howling Frenzy</strong> attack allows them to bite twice. If both bites hit the same
target, that target is dazed for a turn. This recharges once they’re first
bloodied.</p>

<p>When the PCs fight a pack of bravos, it’s interesting to mix up their
forms. They can knock PCs prone or daze them while in jackal form, and their
human-form buddies can benefit from this while using the stronger falchion
attack.</p>

<h3 id="jackalwere-harriers">Jackalwere Harriers</h3>

<p>Harriers are Level 3 Minion Soldiers with no patience for subtlety. Maybe
they’re even younger and more eager members of the pack, or maybe they’re
previously wounded warriors forced to fight. Whatever the case, they’ll try to
knock their enemies down so their stronger buddies can finish the job.</p>

<p>Harriers fight with <strong>daggers</strong> in human form and with <strong>bites</strong> in jackal
form. The bite is a normal minion attack, and the dagger does a bit less damage
and makes the target grant combat advantage for a turn. In either form, if the
harrier hits someone who’s granting combat advantage, they knock the target
prone.</p>

<h3 id="jackalwere-deceiver">Jackalwere Deceiver</h3>

<p>This is an experience pack leader that has developed some minor magical
powers. They often run some sort of operation that allows them to kill human
victims discreetly. Deceivers are Level 4 Controllers wtih 54 HP.</p>

<p>They fight with <strong>bites</strong> or <strong>short swords</strong> depending on their form, and as
usual the bite knocks prone. In jackal form they can also use a <strong>Vicious Howl</strong>
that attacks a Close Blast 3, does thunder damage, and knocks prone on a hit. In
either form they can use a <strong>Gaze of Sleep</strong> (recharge 5+) that does no damage
and causes the target to fall unconscious (save ends). If the unconscious target
takes damage, they get an additional save against the effect.</p>

<p>Deceivers usually lead a band of bravos and harriers, which means they have an
incentive to lean on Vicious Howl and Gaze of Sleep to allow their hench-jackals
to deal bonus damage against the PCs.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These monsters are not technically lycanthropes despite their shapechanging
ability, and this is something I only really got after reading their stat
blocks.</p>

<p>According to the book, the typical jackalwere pack consists of a mated pair of
deceivers leading a mixed band of bravos and harriers. If the pack is currently
in disguise, they’ll hire mercenaries to provide additional protection and
firepower. They prefer to hire half-orcs, goliaths and warforged for these jobs
since they dislike the flesh of these species. This implies they find everyone
else tasty.</p>

<p>These brain-dog-looking things first appeared in the original AD&amp;D Monster
Manual. This is their 4e debut.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Intellect devourers are psychic predators that evolved in the Far Realm and
spread to the deep places of the world. They roam the underground and the
Underdark, hunting other creatures using their psionic powers and draining their
mental energy until only an empty husk remains.</p>

<p>These monsters reproduce by forming larvae from the brain tissue of their slain
victims. These larvae are known as ustilagors, and they hunt in packs until
their first metamorphosis, which turns them into the adults known as Intellect
Predators. Predators who manage to feed well and survive long enough undergo a
second metamorphosis into a larger and more powerful form, known as an Intellect
Glutton or Brain Collector.</p>

<p>Each form is smarter than the last, though even ustilagors are dimly
sapient. Intellect devourers can communicate via telepathy, but they don’t
appear to have much in the way of a culture. They see other sapients as food,
not as conversation partners.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>All intellect devourers are Aberrant Magical Beasts with the Blind
keyword. Blindness is an advantage in their case - they’re immune to gaze
attacks and to the blinded condition. They can perceive the world and fight PCs
just fine with their Blindsight 10.</p>

<p>Their other signature trait is <strong>Mind’s Resilience</strong>. If they take damage while
under an effect a save can end, they can roll a save immediately.</p>

<h3 id="ustilagor">Ustilagor</h3>

<p>Ustilagors are Small devourer larvae. They’re individually weaker than an adult,
but they hunt in packs and are smart enough to coordinate. And as Level 7
Lurkers with 59 HP, they’re still pretty deadly. They have a ground speed of 6.</p>

<p>Ustilagors will first try to secure combat advantage against their chosen
victim. Attacking from ambush will do this, but if that’s not possible they can
do this in two other ways. First they try <strong>Cloud Thoughts</strong>, a minor action
attack that does no damage but makes the ustilagor invisible to the victim (save
ends). If that fails they can use a <strong>Thought Lash</strong>, a ranged attack that does
psychic damage and forces the target to grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>Once it has CA, the Ustilagor will attack with <strong>Clinging Menace</strong>, which allows
them to jump 4 squares without provoking attacks of opportunity and make a melee
attack. This attack does very little damage, but it allows the larva to grab the
target. While the grab lasts (Athletics DC 19 or Acrobatics DC 17 to escape),
the victim is dazed and takes 5 ongoing damage.</p>

<p>Ustilagors can also fight with their <strong>Claws</strong>, which are decent basic
attacks. Those will likely be used to fend off the grabbed victim’s allies if
they try to interrupt the meal.</p>

<h3 id="intellect-predator">Intellect Predator</h3>

<p>This adult specimen is Medium. It has learned the most famous, and scariest,
intellect devourer technique: psychic possession. As a Level 14 Controller with
140 HP, it’s quite dangerous. It has a ground speed of 8.</p>

<p>Intellect Predators will try to open the fight with a <strong>Thought Lance</strong>
(recharge 5+), a ranged attack that does no damage but stuns for a turn on a
hit. If they fail to land this, they’ll use their robust <strong>Claws</strong> until they
can try again.</p>

<p>If the lance hits, they can use <strong>Body Thief</strong> on the stunned target. The attack
does psychic damage and allows the predator to <em>merge</em> with the target,
dominating them. Since the monster is merged, it can’t use its claw attack and
occupies the same space as the target. Normally dominated targets are also
considered dazed, so they can only take a single action on their turn. However,
the predator can grant them an extra move or minor action with the <strong>Puppet
Master</strong> ability, which costs the monster only a minor action. So for all
intents and purposes the dominated target moves normally. They have a -2 to the
save against this possesion, and when it finally ends the predator appears in an
adjacent space.</p>

<p>If the predator is surrounded it can use <strong>Mind Shock</strong> to attack every enemy in
a close burst 5. On a hit this deals a bit of psychic damage and slides the
enemy 1 square, which can open a way for the monster to run away.</p>

<h3 id="intellect-glutton">Intellect Glutton</h3>

<p>Intellect Gluttons are also sometimes called Brain Collectors. They used to be a
different monster in earlier editions, but now they are a particularly large and
old specimen of intellect devourer. Their advanced age only makes them stronger
and more dangerous, since they had that much longer to absorb psychic
energy.</p>

<p>Their bodies are protected by a thick translucent carapace with markings that
resemble human faces, which leads some to speculate that they extract people’s
brains and physically absorb them. This isn’t true, but they’re still
terrifying. A glutton can use its enhanced abilities to puppet victims remotely,
and to control the bodies of the newly dead.</p>

<p>Gluttons are Level 21 Controllers with 196 HP. They have the same Speed 8 of
their younger relatives, and gain Spider Climb 6. They’re surrounded by a wide
<strong>Thought Static</strong> aura (5) that inflicts a -2 penalty to Will for all enemies
inside.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Claws</strong> do average physical damage, but it will definitely prefer to
stay a bit further away and target people inside its aura with psychic
powers. <strong>Thought Feast</strong> is a non-damaging attack that dominates a target (save
ends). The dominated target takes 10 ongoing psychic damage as the glutton
feasts on its thoughts, and the monster itself is insubstantial while this
effect lasts. <strong>Mockery of Life</strong> allows it to control a dead creature. It hits
automatically (the target is dead!), and makes the creature regain 20 HP and
become dominated. This lasts until the end of the encounter or until the
creature drops to 0 HP again. Both abilities recharge whenever the monster is
not dominating a target with either of them.</p>

<p>The glutton also has a simpler ability named <strong>Mind Rend</strong>, a ranged attack that
deals psychic damage and slides the target 1 square. Its main advantage is that
the glutton can use it once per round as a minor action if it has a creature
dominated.</p>

<p>The above powers mean that gluttons will try to have both a living and a dead
creature dominated whenever they can, and when that happens they’ll use Mind
Rend twice per turn to support the actions of their thralls. Having a convenient
corpse lying around the battlefield as the fight starts is a way to speed this
process up. Otherwise the most likely dead target is going to be one of the
other monsters in the encounter when it dies.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Puppet Master makes the Intellect Devourer into one of the scarier dominator
monsters I’ve seen, because the victim gets full turns and the monster is not
targetable while this lasts. Make sure you don’t use more than one or two of
them in a single fight, or things are going to get very annoying very
fast. Save-granting powers and items are a vital tool when fighting them.</p>

<p>Gluttons are actually a bit less annoying to handle since you can still attack
them while they dominate someone. Mockery of Life is a wonderful power to use on
dead artillery enemies after the PCs have moved away from the corpse.</p>

<p>Intellect Devourers aren’t exactly geniuses despite all the brain theming. They
do get smarter as they get older, though, and I think they’re always considered
sapient. Considering their level and preferred environments, I think it’s
plausible to meet a pack of Ustilagors in the same caves where you’d find
troglodytes. Adult devourers might be allied with a balhannoth or with mind
flayers, since they eat <em>thoughts</em>, not <em>brains</em>. And I could see a glutton
making deals with a colony of swordwings: “I get their brains, you take their
stuff”.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>In this post we’ll take a look at the kind of people who make up Imix’s cult in
the middle world. As mentioned in <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/08/04/imix.html">Part 1</a>, the cult promises to give its
adherents the power to burn all that angers them, so it draws in all sorts of
misanthropes, murderers, and people with all-consuming grudges. Rising through
the cult’s ranks means allowing your free will to be burned out piece by
piece. No matter your reasons for joining, soon all you’ll care about is serving
your primordial master.</p>

<p>Cultists of Imix can act covertly, infiltrating peaceful communities to sow
sedition and discord. They can also act more openly, establishing strongholds
and calling out to both recruits and mercenaries to help conquer the surrounding
regions, immolating anyone who opposes them.</p>

<p>The cultist lineup here is pretty diverse, species-wise, for the Fire Lord isn’t
picky like those posers Yeenoghu and Baphomet. He’ll find a use for anyone
willing to swear the oaths, even if that use is “walking bomb”. These stat
blocks should be mixed with more “generic” stat blocks for humans and other
humanoid or elemental opposition to build Imix-themed encounter groups. They’re
not enough to do so on their own.</p>

<h2 id="fire-lord-cultist">Fire Lord Cultist</h2>

<p>This Level 5 Minion Brute represents the bulk of the cult’s low-ranking
followers. They have a speed of 6 and fight with torches and <strong>clubs</strong>. Their
melee attacks deal extra damage if they’re adjacent to an ally, so they have an
incentive to cluster around a PC.</p>

<p>They can also use that torch in the <strong>Ignite</strong> ability. This encounter power is
a melee attack that targets Reflex and deals ongoing 5 fire damage (save
ends). Make sure this is their first attack, because they might not get a chance
to use it otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="servant-of-the-fire-lord">Servant of the Fire Lord</h2>

<p>A more senior and better-trained cultist. Servants of the Fire Lord tend to hide
out in sapient communities disguised as clerics of more benign deities. They use
this cover to undermine the community and spread Imix’s influence over it.</p>

<p>The Servant stat block depicts a half-elf. It’s a Level 6 Skirmisher with the
Leader tag and 73 HP. Their ground speed is 6 and they have low-light vision.</p>

<p>Servants try to always keep moving in order to benefit from their <strong>Wildfire
Stride</strong> passive trait: if they move at least 3 squares, their attacks deal +5
fire damage for a turn.</p>

<p>They wield <strong>scimitars</strong> that can perform a standard basic attack and an
<strong>Immolating Strike</strong>, which is a bit weaker but deals ongoing 5 fire damage
(save ends). The basic strike itself is also kinda weak - it’s the Wildfire
Stride damage bonus that brings it to the expected level of damage.</p>

<p>Their “leaderly” skill is the <strong>Gift of Fire</strong> (recharge 5+), a minor action
that gives every ally within 5 squares a +5 fire damage bonus that lasts for a
turn.</p>

<h2 id="fire-temple-elect">Fire Temple Elect</h2>

<p>The name sounds important, but that’s a lie. Fire Temple Elects are cultists who
had all of their will burned away but didn’t have the potential to master Imix’s
mysteries. They proudly serve their master as walking bombs.</p>

<p>Elects are Level 7 Minion Skirmishers with an excellent ground speed of 7. They
employ human wave tactics, charging enemies with their <strong>shortwswords</strong>. When an
elect drops to 0 HP, they trigger the <strong>Self-Immolation</strong> ability. When this
happens the elect can move its speed as a free action, and then explode. This is
a Close Burst 1 attack that targets Reflex and deals a bit of fire damage. It’s
not selective, so if you have a bunch of elects close together the first one to
get hit might trigger a chain reaction.</p>

<h2 id="fire-temple-champion">Fire Temple Champion</h2>

<p>This one’s actually important. Champions also have little of their free will
left, but unlike the Elects they were tough enough to handle a more substantial
blessing. They’re tasked with protecting key locations and important
individuals. I can also see them leading mercenary squads in operations
important to the cult.</p>

<p>The stat block in the book is for a dragonborn Champion, a Level 8 Soldier with
88 HP. She wears plate and wields a Fullblade (a big two-handed sword).</p>

<p>The Champion has the same <strong>Wildfire Stride</strong> ability seen in the Servant of the
Fire Lord, above. Her <strong>fullblade</strong> attacks mark for a turn, and do damage
that’s only a couple of points below the expected average - Wildfire Stride
makes them stronger than that average. If a marked enemy within reach moves on
their turn, the Champion can use a <strong>Fiery Attack</strong> against them, dealing the
same damage as a basic attack and inflicting ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).</p>

<p>If that marked enemy instead makes an attack that doesn’t include the champion
as a target, she can use a <strong>Fiery Rebuke</strong>, a Close Blast 3 attack that targets
only the triggering enemy, attacks Reflex and deals fire damage.</p>

<p>And as a dragonborn, this particular champion also has one use of <strong>Dragon
Breath</strong> per encounter. It works like the power for Dragonborn PCs, a Close
Blast 3 that targets Reflex. It obviously deals fire damage, and marks those it
hits.</p>

<h2 id="flameborn">Flameborn</h2>

<p>Flameborn are priests who have attained sufficient rank to run a small
temple/stronghold, with the goal of making it grow larger and more
important. They’re ultimately in charge of those recruitment drives and raiding
campaigns I mentioned earlier. In other words they’re accomplished middle
managers.</p>

<p>The stat block we get is a human priest, who is Level 15 Artillery with 111 HP
and the Leader keyword. They have Speed 6 and Resist 10 Fire, the first Imix
cultists actually resistant to their thematic element. They project an aura (5)
named <strong>Fire Within</strong>, which grants Resist 5 Fire to all allies inside.</p>

<p>Flameborn with with <strong>flails</strong> in melee and with <strong>fire bolts</strong> at range. The
bolts also inflict ongoing fire damage. Once per encounter they can call down
the <strong>Blessing of Imix</strong>, which covers a Close Burst 3. It acts as an attack
dealing fire damage to enemies, and grands allies 10 temporary HP.</p>

<p>Their final power is a minor action, <strong>Fiery Eye</strong>, which can target targets
taking ongoing fire damage. It’s a rangged attack against Will that does no
damage, slides the target 2 squares, and makes them grant combat advantage (save
ends).</p>

<p>Flameborn pair well with skirmishers that possess sneak-attack-like
abilities. They can also grant fire resistance to their front-line without
having to stand right behind it.</p>

<h2 id="conflagration-orb">Conflagration Orb</h2>

<p>This is not a cultist, but rather something they might summon with high-level
rituals. Conflagration Orbs are avatars of Imix, and look like miniature suns.
They contain a fragment of Imix’s power and are loyal only to him. They’ll work
alongside the cultists that summon them, because the cult’s goals usually
coincide with the primordial’s, but they are totally unconcerned with the safety
of the cultists and will happily include them in their area attacks if it means
hitting the PCs as well.</p>

<p>It’s interesting that the book uses the word avatar here. It appears to be a
primordial-specific term, since the equivalent entity for a god or demon lord is
called an “Aspect”. Then again it could also be just an editorial oversight.</p>

<p>Anyway, Conflagration Orbs are Level 20 Artillery with 143 HP. They can roll
around at speed 6, but prefer to use their flight speed of 8 (hover)
instead. They’re immune to disease and have Resist 20 Fire. Its basic melee
attack is named <strong>Rolling Frame</strong>, and consists of bumping into people. The
attack allows the orb to shift 1 square as an effect, targets Reflex, and deals
immediate and ongoing fire damage. Its ranged <strong>Scorching Bolts</strong> have much the
same effects but are stronger, and the orb can fire two of them against
different targets in a single action.</p>

<p>The orb complements this with occasional <strong>Fire Tempests</strong> (recharge 5+) which
allow them to make three area attacks that deal fire damage and increase any
ongoing fire damage the targets are suffering by 5. The three areas can’t have
any squares in common.</p>

<p>If the orb is surrounded it can release <strong>Waves of Flame</strong> to get some
space. This deals fire damage in a Close Burst 3, and pushes any targets it hits
3 squares. It also creates a zone that lasts for a turn, partially obscures the
orb, and deals 10 fire damage to enemies caught inside.</p>

<p>Scorching Bolt and Fire Tempest are very strong powers, because they’re
multi-attacks that each do the full expected damage amount for a monster of this
level. The orb can’t target the same enemy multiple times, but it’s still very
good at spreading the hurt around.</p>

<h2 id="chosen-of-imix">Chosen of Imix</h2>

<p>The Chosen are the highest ranking priests in the cult. Each of them is in
charge of a major temple and commands a sizable force of mortal followers,
mercenaries, and elemental servants. They commune directly with Imix and
transmit his orders to the other members of the court. This particular Chosen is
a firesoul genasi.</p>

<p>Chosen rarely leave their temple’s inner sanctum, as this is where their power
is greatest. The book recommends making these sanctums into Fonts of Power, a
special terrain type described in the DMG that enhances the damage of attacks
that have a matching elemental keyword (fire, in this case). Since the Chosen is
an epic tier enemy, they’ll be fighting in terrain that gives their fire attacks
a whopping +15 bonus damage! PCs planning to attack a temple of Imix would do
well to figure out a way to engage the Chosen outside this sanctum.</p>

<p>Chosen are Level 22 Controllers with the Leader keyword. They have a stronger
version of the Flameborn’s Fire Within aura, granting 10 fire resistance to all
allies within 5 squares. Their basic melee attack is a <strong>dagger</strong> that damages
targets and makes them vulnerable 10 to fire for a turn. Pretty much ever other
attack they know  has the Fire keyword, so they’re going to benefit from this
vulnerability <em>and</em> from that Font of Power bonus damage.</p>

<p>Their basic ranged attack is a <strong>Fire Orb</strong> that deals fire damage to the
target, and 5 damage to each enemy adjacent to the target. Before they resort to
that, though, they’ll fill the map with <strong>Servants of Elemental Fire</strong>. This
power is a standard action that summons a “fire grue” to a space within 10
squares of the Chosen. Fire grues are minions with the same defenses as the
Chosen. They can’t make attacks, but each enemy that starts their turn adjacent
to one or more grues takes 10 fire damage (subject to those situational bonuses
I mentioned earlier). The Chosen can spend a minor action to move all grues on
the map up to 6 squares. They can have up to four grues summoned, or six when
they’re bloodied.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can use <strong>Fire’s Fury</strong> to detonate a fire grue,
attacking a Close Burst 1 around it. The explosion deals fire damage and dazes
(save ends) on a hit.</p>

<p>To cap it off we have a few triggered actions. <strong>Demand Focus</strong> triggers when an
enemy willingly moves away from a fire grue without shifting. It attacks the
enemy’s Will and slows them on a hit. <strong>Firepulse</strong> is an encounter power that
triggers when the chosen is hit in melee, and it’s basically a Close Burst 1
fire attack. Finally, when the Chosen is reduced to 0 HP, they’re <strong>Claimed by
Imix</strong>, and explode in a Close Burst 3 dealing fire damage and dazing (save
ends) on a hit.</p>

<h2 id="encounter-groups-and-final-impressions">Encounter Groups and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These cultists weren’t all made to be used together. They’re too far apart in
terms of level for that. Instead, they’re made to be added as “spice” to a group
of other non-themed opponents of similar levels. These would represent
mercenaries, or lower-ranking cultists that don’t necessarily have all these
fire-based blessings. Good candidates include the many Human stat blocks,
elementals, the occasional demon, and even some undead if you want to replicate
the spread found in the Temple of Elemental Evil.</p>

<p>There are plenty of fire-themed monsters in all of those categories, but it’s
more interesting if you vary the composition of Team Monster and include some
members who rely on untyped damage or other damage types. It will prevent your
PCs from trivializing these encounters by stacking fire protection.</p>
