<p><strong>2018-04-09 Update</strong>: After receiving some feedback from Douglas Cole, who
wrote the original Technical Grappling rules, I’ve updated this article to
better handle people with wildly varying SMs and ST scores. I believe the
resulting rules can still be considered “Quick and Dirty” :).</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/04/02/my-gurps-house-rules.html">previous post</a>, I like the Technical Grappling rules on
principle but find them way too detailed for most games in practice. Here’s my
attempt to simplify them into something I can use.</p>

<p>My main goal here is to completely eliminate on-the-fly ST adjustments from the
game. In my experience, nothing has ever reduced the pacing of my games to a
screeching halt like having to look up someone’s new damage dice and recalculate
all their attacks. This is not just a Technical Grappling issue, but since that
is the topic of the day let’s stick to it.</p>

<p>Referred Control as written also has to go, because it involves a similar
amount of “recalculate everything right now”.</p>

<p>Any references to “the book” below refer to GURPS Technical Grappling, and the
“core rules” are the ones from GURPS Characters and Campaigns.</p>

<h2 id="trained-st">Trained ST</h2>

<p>This is <em>gone</em>. It’s one more thing to track for each individual skill and it
raises too slowly to make any difference for most games.</p>

<p>Use the Wrestling bonus from the core rules for that skill and ignore the
concept for the others. Buy Lifting ST instead.</p>

<h2 id="grappling-attacks-and-damage">Grappling Attacks and Damage</h2>

<p>Grappling still does Control Point damage, because that’s the core of the
system! CP damage is annotated as “control” in attack stat lines.</p>

<p>All unarmed grappling attacks inflict CP damage equal to the “thrust” value for
your ST. Lifting ST improves your ST for this purpose and so does the Wrestling
bonus when using that skill. Add +1 damage for each limb used beyond the first
two. If attacker’s SM is larger than that of the target, apply the difference as
a control damage bonus as well.</p>

<p>Armed grappling works mostly like in the book, except you always use your full
ST to calculate control damage. Entangling weapons use your <em>base</em> skill level
instead (not the effective one for that specific attack). This allows you to
write the control damage for your armed grapples <em>once</em> and not worry about it
later on, similar to how normal attacks work.</p>

<p>Any monster whose attacks “automatically count as a successful grapple” in
things like Dungeon Fantasy do linked control damage equal to the basic damage
of their attack. So if that Giant Enemy Crab has claws that do 2d+2 cut, they
now also do 2d+2 control!</p>

<p>Grapplers can still only maintain a maximum amount of CP equal to their ST.</p>

<h2 id="control-threshold">Control Threshold</h2>

<p>Every creature has a <em>Control Threshold</em> (CT) equal to their ST/5, rounded down
to the nearest whole number. This determines how easy it is to impair that
character’s movements via grappling. In relatively “realistic” games with
human-scale characters, 99% of people will have a CT of 2, and the remaining
slabs of pure muscle will have a CT of 3. Things can get quite a bit more varied
in Dungeon Fantasy or other fantastical games.</p>

<p>Write this down once during character creation, and only worry about changing it
if your permanent ST changes.</p>

<h2 id="effects-of-control-points">Effects of Control Points</h2>

<p>Every (CT) Control Points applied to a target translate into a -1 penalty to
DX<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If the target’s torso or head is being grappled this applies to all
their actions. If a limb is being grappled, the full penalty applies to any
actions involving that limb. Half the penalty applies to all other
actions. Treat grapples to multiple locations as a single grapple to the torso
with their combined CP.</p>

<p>In the example from page 6 of Technical grappling, that would give our pal
And’Rezik a total of 13 CP on his target. It’s only 2 CP less and you didn’t
need to halt your fight for 5 minutes to figure that out!</p>

<p>Control points can be spent in the same ways as in the book, and grappled
targets can attempt to erode them with their own grapple attacks subject to the
DX penalty, as usual.</p>

<h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s All, Folks!</h2>

<p>That’s pretty much it. I haven’t actually <em>tested</em> this system in play, but it’s
what I’m going to use in the next game I run where grappling is a thing. I’m
sure I’ve missed some edge cases from the original book, but if those ever
become a problem I’ll address them at that time.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As a way to get back into the habit of writing I thought I would expound a bit
on my preferred GURPS house rules. These are the modifications I make on every
campaign I GM. Some are tried-and-true, some are experimental, and one I haven’t
really used yet but intend to.</p>

<p>None of them are original creations, though. There’s so much stuff out there
already that I don’t feel inclined to come up with my own stuff.</p>

<h2 id="the-permanent-fixtures">The Permanent Fixtures</h2>

<p>These rules should be in effect in pretty much any game I GM.</p>

<h3 id="metric">Metric!</h3>

<p>If I have one complaint about GURPS is that it uses Imperial measurements for
everything. I don’t! I use metric instead. By now I’m pretty used to applying
simple conversions for lengths and weights.</p>

<p>Areas and volumes are more annoying, though I suspect <a href="http://bignose.whitetree.org/projects/gurps/house-rules.devel/gurps-metric.xhtml">this site</a> would help
me there. I don’t agree with <em>everything</em> on it (for example, I’m not rounding
Basic Lift to the nearest whole kilogram, that’s not granular enough), but it
does a good job overall.</p>

<h3 id="alternate-guns-specialties">Alternate Guns Specialties</h3>

<p>These are from Pyramid #3/65. It greatly simplifies the existing Guns
specialties, and I think it makes a lot of sense. I use it on any game that has
guns at all.</p>

<h2 id="occasional-appearances">Occasional Appearances</h2>

<p>These don’t always appear, but I like them nonetheless.</p>

<h3 id="complimentary-skills">Complimentary Skills</h3>

<p>This rule originally appeared on GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 2 and GURPS Action 2, and
was restated on Pyramid #3/70. It encourages teamwork, and gives heroes a bit of
an extra edge in general. It hasn’t appeared in all of my games because people
rarely think to invoke this rule, but if anyone asks whether they can use it the
answer is always “yes”.</p>

<h3 id="tactics-for-the-win">Tactics For the Win</h3>

<p>This originally appeared in GURPS Martial Arts. It allows the Tactics skill to
grant rerolls when not using tactical maps, or to enable tricky positioning
shenanigans when using them. It makes playing “warlord” characters mechanically
viable, and the only reason it’s not a permanent fixture is that people don’t
always make those types of character.</p>

<h3 id="team-efforts">Team Efforts</h3>

<p>Another one from Action and Dungeon Fantasy. It simplifies group tests.</p>

<h3 id="range-bands">Range Bands</h3>

<p>This is from GURPS Action. It’s a lot easier to use than the Size/Speed range
table for combats without a map! In practice it mostly means giving nearly
everyone a -3 penalty for ranged attacks and calling it a day, since combats in
my games rarely happen further away 20m that even when everyone has guns.</p>

<h2 id="experiments-tried-and-untried">Experiments, Tried and Untried</h2>

<p>These are rules I <em>want</em> to use more often, but I still don’t feel I’m good
enough at applying them to so in every game.</p>

<h3 id="technical-grappling-simplified">Technical Grappling, Simplified.</h3>

<p>This is obviously from GURPS Technical Grappling. I like the basic idea of the
Technical Grappling system, but as written it’s way too complex to use in any
game that is not entirely about playing through an entire MMA tournament at a
high level of detail.</p>

<p>I would like to keep the central mechanic where grapplers to “control damage”
according to their skill and strength, and where this damage makes it
increasingly harder for the opponent to move. Referred Control has to <em>go</em>,
however, and I strongly dislike the idea of adjusting people’s ST mid-fight. I’m
also not too keep on calculating multiple ST scores for every possible
combination of limbs you’re using for a grapple.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’m strongly tempted to buy Douglas Cole’s Dungeon Grappling
supplement for D&amp;D-alikes and port it back to GURPS, since it seems to do lot of
what I described above already. However, now that I’ve discovered that the
<a href="http://www.sjgames.com/ill/archive/April_01_2018/Announcing_Hall_of_Judgment_for_Dungeon_Fantasy_RPG">official GURPS conversion of his Hall of Tyr adventure</a> is real, I’ll
probably wait for that instead. In the meantime I might work something out on my
own.</p>

<h3 id="hybrid-ritual-path-magic">Hybrid Ritual Path Magic</h3>

<p>I’m a big fan of the Ritual Path Magic system as described in, well, GURPS
Ritual Path Magic. I like the energy accumulation model and the flexibility it
allows. That book is more geared towards settings where magic is rare and/or
hidden, though, which means it tends to limit magic by what is “mundanely
possible” in the setting in question. You can exceed those limits with Greater
effects, but it’s expensive.</p>

<p>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 19: Incantation Magic describes a variant of this system
meant to fit a D&amp;D-like setting, where magic is known and common. The limits it
imposes are a lot less fuzzy (you can do <em>this</em> much damage, or give <em>this</em> big
a bonus). The exact amounts are dependent on Magery and there are no Greater
effects that allow you to exceed them. That’s good for my purposes, but
unfortunately the system is based on an “effect shaping” model where spells give
you more skill penalties the more powerful they are.</p>

<p>What I want here is a hybrid system, one that’s based on energy but also geared
towards obvious-magic settings. What I’d do here is basically use the system
from RPM with the Magery-based limits from DF, and the removal of Greater
effects. I haven’t tested this in actual play with real players, but I would
like to.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Links to all of them will appear in the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">project page</a>, which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Swashbuckler, which means today’s character is
Jirelle. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Jirelle.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2014 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Even if you’re familiar with Pathfinder’s Iconics, Jirelle might be somewhat new
to you. This is because the class she represents, the Swashbuckler, is not from
the core rules but from the “Advanced Class Guide” supplement. You can find her
bio <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg5a?Meet-the-Iconics-Jirelle">here</a>, and the only place where I could find her stats is inside <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9a64">this
free package of premade iconic characters</a> that contains all of them.</p>

<p>From these, we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Jirelle is a half-elf born in the Shackles, a pirate-infested archipelago. She
sunk her evil pirate’s mother ship to avoid becoming a demonic sacrifice, but
the ship and its whole crew later returned as undead. Her main long-term goal
is returning them to the depths.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her fighting style is acrobatic and daring, relying a lot on precision and
fencing skill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wields a rapier as her main weapon, and despite the illustration showing
one of every traditional off-hand fencing weapon on her person, the character
sheet indicates the buckler is her favorite.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This version of Jirelle is pretty much identical to the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/19/pathfinder-df-swashbuckler.html">GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy</a> version, with the main difference being equipment. Her armor and
buckler are a lot heavier, and thus I was forced to perform a little point
shuffling to get her an Armor Familiarity perk. She’s still as good at fencing
as ever, though.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed here is that the DFRPG version of Rapier Wit uses the
Intimidation skill rather than Public Speaking. I don’t think it would be a
stretch to allow it to be used with Public Speaking, so I’m keeping that skill
here. If your GM sticks to the letter of what the book says, feel free to move
those Public Speaking points to Intimidation instead.</p>

            <p>In this post I continue to write up the iconic characters from Pathfinder for
use in the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Links to all of them will appear on
the <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">project page</a>, which also contains the links to the GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy versions.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Martial Artist, which means today’s character is Sajan
the Monk. Here he is:</p>

<p>I think he looks pretty cool! His <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Sajan_Gadadvara">bio</a> and <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/sajan.html">official stats</a> give us the
following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>He was born in Vudra, his world’s India analogue, where he was a member of the
warrior caste along with his beloved twin sister Sajni. Even after they were
posted to separate barracks at the age of 12 they still met regularly to spar
and hang out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sajni was given away as part of a peace agreement, and Sajan ran after her. He
tracked her down to Absalom, his world’s “big cosmopolitan city”, and has been
looking for her since.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a monk he’s quite acrobatic and prefers to rely on his flurry of blows in
combat. He might also grapple or trip opponents with his hooked “temple
sword” if that’s more tactically advantageous.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/13/pathfinder-df-monk.html">GURPS Dungeon Fantasy version</a> used the stats for a khopesh from GURPS
Low-Tech for the “temple sword”. Since this one is restricted only to the
material in the DFRPG boxed set, we go with the Heavy Falchion stats and give up
on the rules for weapon hooks. We also had to lose the gauntlets, as his light
cloth armor is a bit heavier here. Sajan continues to be a very effective
combatant either with his sword or with his fists, and has most of the abilities
people have come to associate with monks in d20.</p>
