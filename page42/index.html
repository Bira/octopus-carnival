            <p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Rakshasas are inspired by Indian mythology and have been in the game from the
days of AD&amp;D 1st Edition. In Fourth, they’re in both the Monster Manual and the
Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Rakshasas are evil spirits encased in flesh. In their natural forms, they look
like humanoids with the heads of great predatory cats, usually tigers. Their
hands are also “inverted”, with the palms located where the back of a human’s
hand would be and vice-versa. This looks odd, but doesn’t impact their dexterity
in any way.</p>

<p>A rakshasa’s greatest desire is to accumulate lots of wealth and power and to
spend eternity surrounded by luxury and vice. They have absolutely no moral
qualms when it comes to achieving these goals, of course. Rakshasas are highly
skilled at fighting, arcane magic, and many other skills they had time to hone
during their centuries of life.</p>

<p>While each individual’s abilities vary as much as those of player characters,
each Rakshasa has enough skill at illusion to be able to disguise itself as any
humanoid. They use this to infiltrate mortal society in order to achieve those
positions of power. Why go to the trouble of building a kingdom yourself when
you can just gank some king and replace him? And then maybe kill his family off
so you can replace them with your own buddies and hangers-on?</p>

<p>In other words: you know all those nasty rumors people spread about
doppelgangers? Turns out it’s the rakshasas who do most of those things. And
since the doppelganger entry describes them as mostly just people trying to live
peaceful lives, I wouldn’t be surprised if the rakshasas were responsible for
pinning their own misdeeds on innocent doppelgangers. A setting that includes
both cat-folk and rakshasas will also see the former shoulder some of the
later’s bad reputations.</p>

<p>Fighting rakshasas is difficult. First you have to figure out who it is. Then
you need to deal with its entourage of lackeys (unwitting or not). And only then
will you fight the beast itself. Even if you kill one, it will reincarnate
elsewhere in the world after a period of time wandering as a tormented, bodiless
spirit. Reincarnated rakshasas come back as full adults with all of their
memories and abilities, and are quite likely to try to get some payback on
whoever killed them. Legends say a rakshasa can only be truly slain by a blessed
weapon that pierces its heart.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual says that the origins of Rakshasas are shrouded in mistery,
but that most sages believe they descend from demons who escaped from the Abyss
and er, spawned in the world. Rakshasas themselves scoff at this notion. Demons
are too uncouth to have produced such refined creatures as they!</p>

<p>The Monster Vault gets more specific: a Rakshasa is what happens when a Deva
goes bad. Devas are a playable race introduced in the Player’s Handbook 2, and
occupy roughly the same narrative space as aasimar from previous editions but in
a cooler way. They have that “immortal spirit encased in flesh” thing going on,
and reincarnate as fully formed adults when they die, with little memory of
their past lives.</p>

<p>Devas have ties to the Astral Sea and to the forces of good, but when a Deva
turns to evil they come back as a Rakshasa when they next
reincarnate. Theoretically, if a Rakshasa repents and rejects its evil ways, it
will become a Deva again in its next incarnation, but such an event has yet to
be recorded.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Rakshasa are Medium Natural Humanoids, with a land speed of 6 and low-light
vision. Their signature ability is <strong>Deceptive Veil</strong>, a minor action illusion
that allows them to disguise themselves as any medium humanoid. Piercing the
disguise requires an opposed Insight test versus their Bluff. Obviously, all
Rakshasa have pretty good Charisma and are trained in Bluff. The MV version puts
less emphasis on skills and has a fixed DC equal to 20+the level of the
rakshasa. Given they’re usually Paragon-tier, this leads to “spot the
doppelganger” levels of difficulty.</p>

<p>There’s no less than six different stat blocks for rakshasas across both books,
five in the MM and one (plus two updates) in the MV.</p>

<h3 id="rakshasa-warrior-both">Rakshasa Warrior (Both)</h3>

<p>What passes for a “foot soldier” among Rakshasa, you can likely find them acting
as elite bodyguards for their higher-ranked overlords. Warriors are Level 15
Soldiers with 142 HP and all common Rakshasa traits. Both versions are good
physical combatants, and the MV one has a few more magical tricks at its
disposal.</p>

<p>Warriors wear scale armor and wield heavy shields and longswords. Their
<strong>longsword</strong> attacks have them roll twice and use either result, meaning they
always have 5e Advantage on them. A hit does some damage and marks the target
for a turn.</p>

<p>They can also attack with their <strong>claws</strong>, which are just a weaker basic attack
in the MM but have an ongoing damage (save ends) rider on the MV, meaning you
actually have a use for them there.</p>

<p>If a marked enemy within 5 squares shifts or attacks someone else, the warrior
can use a <strong>Tiger Pounce</strong> to close the distance and make a claw attack. The MM
version shifts, the MV one teleports.</p>

<p>The MV Warrior also has an <strong>Illusory Ambush</strong> minor-action encounter power that
performs a complex switcheroo: it turns the warrior invisible, creates an
illusion of it on the same square, and allows it to shift its speed. The
transition is indistinguishable to observers and the effects last for a turn or
until the illusion is attacked.</p>

<h3 id="rakshasa-archer-both">Rakshasa Archer (Both)</h3>

<p>Archers are level 15 Artillery with 110 HP and all common traits. They fight in
melee with their <strong>Claws</strong> (which have a small ongoing damage rider in the MV)
and at range with their ornate <strong>longbows</strong>. They can make two basic longbow
attacks against different targets as a standard action. The MV version also
applies 5e Advantage to its basic longbow attacks.</p>

<p>Instead of making a normal or double attack, the archer can opt to use a <strong>Ghost
Arrow</strong> (Ranged 20 vs. Reflex; recharge 5-6) which does necrotic damage and
prevents the target from spending healing surges (save ends).</p>

<p>Aside from Deceptive Veil the MV version also has <strong>Illusory Escape</strong>, which
pulls the same switcheroo as the warrior’s power, but triggers when the archer
is hit by a ranged attack. It recharges when the archer is first bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="rakshasa-mage-mv">Rakshasa Mage (MV)</h3>

<p>Rakshasa Mages are Level 16 Controllers with 153 HP, all common traits, and a
whole lot of illusion spells. They make it almost impossible for the PCs to keep
to any sort of formation, since all of their abilities do something even if they
miss.</p>

<p>The mage’s most common attack will likely be <strong>Misleading Visions</strong> (area burst
1 with 5 vs. Will; enemies only), an illusion that does psychic damage and
slides the targets 4 squares on a hit. On a miss, it still slides them 1 square.</p>

<p>A bit less often, it will intensify those illusions into <strong>Visions of Terror</strong>
(area burst 1 within 5 vs Will; enemies only; recharge 5-6), which do greater
psychic damage and immobilize (save ends). On a miss, they still do half damage
and slow for a turn.</p>

<p>They can also create <strong>Persistent Images</strong> as minor actions. These may represent
any Medium or smaller object or creature, and can be animate, but produce no
noise. They appear with 10 squares of the mage, and it’s a DC 22 Insight check
to realize they’re illusions. That’s easy for mid-paragon characters, but they
still have to take the time to analyze the illusion. The image lasts for a turn,
but the mage can both sustain it and move it 6 squares with a single minor
action.</p>

<p>If the PCs manage to cut through all the bullshit and close to melee range,
they’ll find the rakshasa mage is quite proficient with its <strong>Claws</strong>, which do
respectable damage and teleport 3 squares on a hit. Even a miss still teleports
the target 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="rakshasa-assassin-mm">Rakshasa Assassin (MM)</h3>

<figure class="right">

</figure>

<p>This black panther Rakshasa is a Level 17 Skirmisher with 160 HP and all
standard traits.</p>

<p>Assassins fight with paired <strong>shortswords</strong>, and they can perform two basic
melee attacks per standard action. They also deal extra “sneak attack” damage
with combat advantage. The quotes are important here - if they attack twice,
both attacks get the bonus damage, unlike what happens with PC rogues.</p>

<p>Aside from the usual Deceptive Veil, they also have a couple of ninja
skills. <strong>Shadow Form</strong> gives them phasing during any turn in which they move
more than 2 squares. <strong>Phantom Distraction</strong> (close burst 1 vs. Will; recharge
5-6) is a minor action that does no damage but dazes for a turn on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="rakshasa-noble-mm">Rakshasa Noble (MM)</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-rakshasa-noble.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Nobles are basically slightly stronger mages with a different illusion
repertoire, and are the people warriors, archers, and assassins serve. They’re
Level 19 Controllers with 178 HP and all standard traits. Their native speed
goes up to 7.</p>

<p>As a minor action they can use a <strong>Phantom Image</strong> (recharge 5-6) to essentially
give 5e Disadvantage to all attacks made against their AC or Reflex that
turn. If either result is a critical, though, it’s the one that counts. There’s
a bit of increased risk there.</p>

<p>The noble’s main attack spells are <strong>Mind Twist</strong> (Ranged 20 vs. Will) and
<strong>Phantom Lure</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will). The first does psychic damage and dazes
(save ends). The second does no damage and slides the target 5 squares.</p>

<p>Every so often the noble can cast a <strong>Frightful Phantom</strong> (Ranged 5 vs. Will;
recharge 5-6), which does a heap of psychic damage, pushes the target 5 squares
and stuns it (save ends).</p>

<p>If all else fails, the noble has to resort to its weak <strong>Claws</strong>, which do a bit
of damage and blind for a turn on a hit. They’re more of an aid to get away from
melee range than a proper attack.</p>

<h3 id="rakshasa-dread-knight-mm">Rakshasa Dread Knight (MM)</h3>

<p>This is at the level range that could represent one of Eberron’s feared Lords of
Dust. It’s a Level 24 Soldier with 220 HP and all common traits. Dread Knights
project an <strong>Aura of Doom</strong> (5) that cuts surge-based healing in half for any
enemies inside.</p>

<p>Thei fight with <strong>Longswords</strong> in melee that have that “roll twice and use the
better result”/”5e Advantage” bonus, and also mark for a turn. Dread Knights can
use a standard action to make <em>three</em> such attacks against the same target, and
if at least two hit the victim is also dazed (save ends). That’s a lot of d20’s
hitting the table at once.</p>

<p>They can also use <strong>Claw</strong> attacks, though these are nothing special. They could
benefit from an ongoing damage rider like the MV updates.</p>

<p>For utility, aside from Deceptive Veil they can use a <strong>Knight Move</strong> to fly 6
squares as a move action, though they must land at the end.</p>

<p>Dread Knights are a bit mechanically simpler than I imagined, but they’re still
dangerous and won’t be alone when encountered.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have a whole bunch of sample rakshasa encounters here, ranging from level 15
to 24. They all follow a similar theme, being basically what you fight at the
end of the adventure after uncovering the rakshasa plot and getting past the
unwitting entourage. The groups consist either of all-rakshasa Evil Parties, or
1-2 rakshasa and a group of dangerous pets or other equally evil co-conspirators
(yuan-ti, cambions, devils).</p>

<p>I’m a cat person, so I quite like these villains based on looks alone. You want
to pit your party against Shere Khan, you use a Rakshasa. Given their decadent
nature and tendency to collaborate with devils, you might also be able to use
them as a metaphor for how big corporations have an affinity for fascism. If
rakshasa existed in the real world, people like Zuck, Musk and Thiel would be
serious candidates for being evil tigers in disguise.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Quicklings have been around since AD&amp;D 1st Edition, where they appeared in the
Monster Manual II. Here, they appear only in the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Quicklings are wicked fast and just plain wicked. They’re little serial killers
who like to knife others for food, loot and sport. The last two mean they
definitely don’t restrict themselves to hunting animals.</p>

<p>Their preferred tactics are clever ambushes, and they do their best to never
stand still in a fight. Quicklings often ally with fey and other creatures that
share their proclivities, and I imagine they’re not above working as
mercenaries.</p>

<p>The 4e illustration is a lot more monstrous than the one in the AD&amp;D Monster
Manual II, which was just a little foppish dude. One interesting bit of lore in
1e is that quicklings might be brownies who delved too deep into forbidden
magics. You can certainly use that explanation if you want to, but it’s also
entirely appropriate for them to be their own species of Feywild nightmare
creature.</p>

<p>Speaking of that, Quicklings often leave the Feywild and stalk the world looking
for good “opportunities”. They’re highly intelligent and so might be down for
whatever evil scheme your villains are hatching this week even if they’re not
the main opposition.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two stat blocks for quicklings here. Both are Small Fey Humanoids with
low-light vision and a fantastic land speed of <em>12</em>. Their AC and Reflex are
also notably higher than the expected for their level.</p>

<h3 id="quickling-runner">Quickling Runner</h3>

<p>This Level 9 Skirmisher has 96 HP and all common quickling traits. It also gains
a further +4 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>The runner’s basic attack is a <strong>short sword</strong>, which it can also use in a
maneuver called <strong>Quick Cuts</strong>. This allows the runner to move its speed (12)
and make two basic attacks at a -2 penalty at any two points during the
move. This is an at-will attack, but it cannot be used while the quickling is
immobilized or slowed.</p>

<p>To bring the runner’s damage up to the new baseline, you need to either update
its base sword damage or remove the -2 penalty from the Quick Cuts
attacks. Quick Cuts is going to be its most frequent attack, and you should be
trying to move past the party’s front line and into the ranged squishies to
apply it. That +4 against OAs sure helps.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the quickling can perform a <strong>Fey Shift</strong>, shifting 10
squares as a standard action. It’s likely to use this to escape when it sees the
fight isn’t going in its favor. If this was a move action instead, it would be a
good initial maneuver to get to those squishies from ambush.</p>

<p>As a minor action, it can also <strong>Maintain Mobility</strong> (recharge 4-6), which
automatically ends any immobilization applied upon it.</p>

<h3 id="quickling-zephyr">Quickling Zephyr</h3>

<p>Not just a higher level runner, the Zephyr is a bit more subtle. It’s a level 14
lurker with 82 HP and all common quickling traits. It also fights with a <strong>short
sword</strong> which is even more in need of a damage update than the runner’s.</p>

<p>As a move action, the quickling can use <strong>Blinding Speed</strong> (recharge 4-6) move
its speed and become invisible, which lasts for a turn or until it attacks. It’s
a cheap way of getting combat advantage, despite not being always available. The
zephyr’s <strong>Unstoppable</strong> trait allows it to ignore all difficult terrain and to
run across any solid or liquid surface, so it can be safely employed in the
gnarliest of maps.</p>

<p>If it attacks with combat advantage, the zephyr deals some additional sneak
attack damage, though that would also need a boost to be in line with the new
math.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get a single level 9 sample encounter: 1 quickling runner, 1 eladrin twilight
incanter, and a feymire crocodile.</p>

<p>Going by lore and level, quicklings should also be able to work well with
banshrae, lamias, hags, and the occasional ogre, troll, or oni.</p>

<p>The stat blocks we’re given do roughly half the damage the new math says they
should, but once you update them they’re quite usable. The quickling’s speed can
certainly be played up for a bit of horror. “You see a quickling in the
distance. You blink and it’s right next to you, its sword already in your
spleen.”</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/09/25/purple-worm.html">Let&#39;s Read the 4e Monster Manual/Vault: Purple Worm</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Purple Worms have been in D&amp;D since at least the days of BECMI, and are likely
inspired by the sand worms of Frank Herbert’s Dune. They’re in both the Monster
Manual and Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Believe it or not, purple worms were not created by some drug-addled wizard or
vengeful primordial. They’re entirely natural creatures, just like cats and
dogs. Or drakes. Or behemoths. Or bullettes. Yeah, the world of D&amp;D is kind of a
dangerous place.</p>

<p>Large enough to swallow a giant whole, purple worms burrow through the Underdark
and through rocky and mountainous terrain on the surface. They’re not always
hungry, but their feeding strategy is gorging themselves about once a week so
the end result is more or less the same. They’re such efficient tunnelers that
you can’t tell they’re coming until they’re almost directly underneath you. They
also have a knack for showing up precisely when people think things can’t get
any worse. Large Underdark settlements are always protected by a perimeter of
anti-worm wards, and when these settlements war with each other sabotaging those
wards is a popular move.</p>

<p>Unlike the Dune sand worms, purple worms can burrow through solid rock just
fine, and in addition to their cavernous maws some have a venomous stinger on
the tip of their tails. They dig by eating the rock or soil and quickly
excreting it, though stuff like refined metal, precious ores and gems have a
tendency to stick in the worm’s gut for longer periods. So if you manage to kill
one, its gut may contain treasure!</p>

<p>Purple worm tunnels are very large and permanent, and they don’t reuse
them. An area rich in food might have several purple worms hunting it, and will
end up looking like a labyrinth. Worm tunnels tend to become important natural
roads in the Underdark, and it’s not uncommon for smaller creatures to move into
them right after the worm passes them by. Instant ecosystem!</p>

<p>These beasts are impossible to tame, but people keep trying to use magic to
control them. Drow and illithids can’t resist their potential as a weapon, and
dwarves can’t resist their potential as a construction tool. I mean, a purple
worm could likely have dug the tunnel under the English Channel in a fraction of
the time the real-world construction crew took.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s pretty much inevitable that these spells will wear off at the
worst possible time, leading to disaster. After digging the tunnel, that same
purple worm would have likely delivered a much quicker and less painful Brexit
by eating Britain.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-manual">The Numbers (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>Purple Worms are Natural Beasts with the Blind keyword. They have both
tremorsense 20 and blindsight 10, plus a respectable burrow speed with
Tunneling. We have two stat blocks here.</p>

<h3 id="purple-worm">Purple Worm</h3>

<p>The basic model is Huge, and a Level 16 Solo Soldier with 780 HP. As a blind
creature, it’s immune to gaze attacks, and also immune to illusions. It crawls
at speed 6, and burrows at speed 3.</p>

<p>The worm’s basic attack is a Reach 3 <strong>Bite</strong> that, unlike most basic attacks in
the book, targets Reflex. No amount of armor is going to protect you from it!  A
hit does damage and grabs the target (Athletics DC 34 or Acrobatics DC 30 to
escape).</p>

<p>Once the worm has grabbed a target, it can “worry” it with its <strong>Clamping
Jaws</strong>, which has the same accuracy vs. Reflex and damage as a basic bite but
does half damage on a miss.</p>

<p>It can also try to <strong>Swallow</strong> them. This targets the Fortitude of the
victim. On a hit, the target gets swallowed and is now inside the purple
worm. The victim is considered dazed and restrained, and only has line of sight
and effect to the worm. Also, no one has line of sight or effect to the victim.</p>

<p>While swallowed, the victim can only make basic attacks, and takes 10 physical
and 10 acid damage at the start of the worm’s turns. The only good news here is
that the worm’s AC is like 8 points lower from the inside. The only way to
escape is to kill the worm, which causes the victim to be regurgitated.</p>

<p>The worm can’t bite other people while it has a target grabbed in its jaws, but
it can fight normally after swallowing. There’s no mention of how many victims
fit in its gullet. “One” is the merciful answer, but “1 Large or 2 Medium or 4
Small” is traditional.</p>

<h3 id="elder-purple-worm">Elder Purple Worm</h3>

<p>Elder Purple Worms have grown to size Gargantuan (the largest possible under the
rules). They’re large enough to swallow titans! Elders are Level 24 Solo
Soldiers with 1145 HP and the same immunities as the younger specimen. Their
land speed is 8 and their burrowing speed 4.</p>

<p>The elder’s attacks are exactly the same as those of the basic worm, with bigger
numbers. Their AC is 7 points lower from the inside, and their digestive damage
is 20 physical and 20 acid per turn. Again there’s no mention of how many
creatures fit in the worm’s gullet. The traditional answer would be “1 Huge or 2
Large or 4 Medium or 8 Small”, but it might be a tad unfair to allow it to
swallow the whole party.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-vault">The Numbers (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>Purple worms in the Vault are fairly different, and generally more adequate for
use as solo encounters. We also get two stat blocks, and both are Huge Natural
Beasts (blind).</p>

<h3 id="adult-purple-worm">Adult Purple Worm</h3>

<p>Adult Purple Worms are Level 14 Solo Brutes with 560 HP. Not sure if I
mentioned this before, but the new monster math also gives solos less HP. Their
tremorsense and blindsight are both range 10, and they both crawl and burrow at
speed 6.</p>

<p>As a MV Solo, this worm has some traits that help it stand up to a paragon
party: <strong>Ponderous</strong> allows it to take immediate actions while stunned, dazed,
or dominated; and <strong>Bloodied Frenzy</strong> allows it to take an extra minor action in
its turn while bloodied.</p>

<p>The basic Reach 3 <strong>Bite</strong> now targets AC, and has no riders to its considerable
damage. All the gizzard gimmicks are now packed into the <strong>Devour Whole</strong> attack
(Melee 3 vs. Fortitude). A hit here does similar damage to a bite and swallows
the target.</p>

<p>Being swallowed here is a little less nightmarish than for the MM version. The
restrictions on line of sight and effect still apply, and the victim is off the
board and so obviously can’t move around. However, they are no longer dazed or
restrained, and can use any of their attacks against the worm. They can even try
to crawl out of its gullet as if escaping from a grab, rolling against a lenient
DC of 21.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the worm’s defenses are the same from the inside
now. Swallowed victims take 30 acid damage at the end of their own turns, and
any close or area attacks used from inside the worm also target all other
creatures swallowed by it. While we still get no word on what’s the limit for
those, we do have explicit confirmation that there can be more than one. So you
can choose between the traditional answer and “no limit”!</p>

<p>This worm also has a lot of other options to bring pain to the party, all of
them minor actions. <strong>Fling</strong> (Melee 3 vs. Fortitude) deals damage and slides
the target 4 squares; <strong>Regurgitate</strong> spits out a swallowed victim, making it
appear within 4 squares of the worm and take a chunk of automatic damage; and
the <strong>Poison Stinger</strong> (Melee 3 vs. Fortitude)  mentioned in the Lore section
does a bit of physical damage and 15 ongoing poison damage (save ends). With
Bloodied Frenzy active, it can do all three and still swallow someone.</p>

<p>You also have <strong>Thrash</strong>, a reaction that triggers whenever an attack hits the
worm. It’s a Melee 3 attack vs. Reflex, targeting one or two creatures, doing
the same damage as the bite and pushing them up to 6 squares. This is why it has
Ponderous!</p>

<h3 id="purple-worm-tunneler">Purple Worm Tunneler</h3>

<p>This specimen is quite a bit faster, and likely the one you want to use for your
Eurotunnel/Brexit combo. It’s a Level 19 Solo Skirmisher with 728 HP. Its land
and burrow speeds are 8.</p>

<p>The tunneler has the same Ponderous and Bloodied Frenzy traits as the basic
model. Its <strong>Bite</strong> does damage and allows it to shift half its speed on a
hit. <strong>Devour Whole</strong> also works the same, with an escape DC of 24.</p>

<p>As a move action, the tunneler can <strong>Barrel Through</strong> its foes, shifting its
speed and making an attack against the Reflex of every enemy it passes adjacent
to. A hit here does a bit of damage and pushes the target 2 squares.</p>

<p>The tunneler also has a bigger stinger, since its minor-action attack is
<strong>Stinger Impalement</strong> (Melee 3 vs. AC). This does more physical damage than the
basic worm’s stinger, slides the target 4 squares, and deals 10 ongoing poison
damage (save ends). There’s no limit to the number of times per round it may do
this, so you’re looking at up to three impalement attacks plus a devouring when
the worm is bloodied.</p>

<p>Finally, it also has <strong>Thrash</strong>, which works the same way with bigger numbers.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual has a level 18 sample encounter: 1 purple worm, and 2 savage
minotaurs.</p>

<p>Purple worms don’t cooperate with anyone, of course, but they’ll often be
attracted by fights against other monsters and try to eat everyone present, just
like Bullettes but on a bigger scale. In other words, purple worms are just the
thing to use on a party who’s all happy that they’ve outgrown bullettes.</p>

<p>I like purple worms! I don’t think they’re exclusive content, but they’re still
a very D&amp;D kind of monster. In previous editions I kinda felt they suffered from
the same problem as dragons, looking so powerful that people rarely put them in
their games. Here, I have a better handle of when they’re appropriate.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Panthers are real-world animals, and something like them has been in the game
since the beginning. In 4e, they’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>This is another one of those Monster Manual entries that focuses on fantastical
versions of a mundane animal. The implied setting of D&amp;D does have mundane
panthers, but the book notes that they mostly hunt small game and avoid contact
with people.</p>

<p>However, that setting also has <em>supernatural</em> panthers touched by the energies
of the Feywild and Shadowfell. These are larger, stronger, and have no problem
stalking humanoids that blunder into their hunting grounds. They have powers
that are thematic to their home planes, and can move between them and the world
at sunrise and sunset.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two stat blocks here, one each for fey and shadow panthers.</p>

<h3 id="fey-panther">Fey Panther</h3>

<p>This is a Medium Fey Beast, and a Level 4 Skirmisher with 54 HP. It has trained
Perception and low-light vision, and moves with a ground speed of 8 and a climb
speed of 6.</p>

<p>The fey panther’s basic attack is a <strong>Bite</strong> that also allows it to shift 1
square on a hit. Its <strong>Charging Pounce</strong> ability allows it to deal extra damage
and knock the target prone on a charge.</p>

<p>Finally, it can also use <strong>fey step</strong> like an eladrin, teleporting 5 squares
once per encounter.</p>

<p>These abilities add up to a fighting style where the panther tries its best to
not stay engaged with a single target, using the shifts from its basic attack
and the teleport from Fey Step to make sure it’s always in position to charge
someone without receiving opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>If you really want a mundane panther, you could remove Fey Step from this one
and maybe lower its level to 3.</p>

<h3 id="spectral-panther">Spectral Panther</h3>

<p>Real-world black panthers are jaguars with a specific gene that makes them all
black. D&amp;D black panthers come from the Shadowfell!</p>

<p>Spectral panthers are Medium Shadow Beasts, and Level 9 Lurkers with 76 HP. They
run at speed 7, and oddly seem to lack a climb speed. They have trained
Perception and low-light vision.</p>

<p>Their name comes from the ability to assume a <strong>Spectral Form</strong> as a standard
action, which turns them insubstantial and gives them a +5 bonus to Stealth
(bringing the total up to +19), but makes their attacks deal half damage. Once
in this form, they can use another standard action to turn <strong>Invisible</strong>. Both
conditions can be ended as a free action, and invisibility also ends when the
panther makes an attack.</p>

<p>They attack with their <strong>Claws</strong>, and when an enemy moves or shifts into an
adjacent square they can also use a <strong>Tail Spike</strong> as a reaction. Both attacks
deal extra damage if the panther has Combat Advantage against the target.</p>

<p>Overall, the spectral panther is slightly sub-par as a lurker, because it takes
two turns to become invisible and the combat advantage bonus damage isn’t big
enough to make up for that. You’re probably better off sticking to
insubstantiality for repositioning, and relying on flanking and such to get
combat advantage. Or you could change <strong>Spectral Form</strong> so it makes the panther
invisible right away.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have a single sample encounter here, along with the usual statement that lots
of intelligent humanoids end up keeping supernatural panthers as pets and attack
animals.</p>

<p>The encounter is level 9: 2 spectral panthers, a dark stalker, and a pair of
shadar-kai warriors.</p>

<p>Panthers are… okay, I guess. Their existence is a cool bit of color, but they
don’t make immediately want to use them in an encounter like other monsters here
did.</p>

<p>Owlbears have been in the game since at least BECMI, and likely since the
beginning. As another rather popular and iconic monster, they are both in the
Monster Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Owlbears are dangerous predators that originated in the Feywild but spread to
the world ages ago. They have the strength of a bear, the cunning of an owl, and
are always hungry.</p>

<p>The creature’s owl bits give it excellent night vision, better talons than what
you usually find in a bear, and a characteristic hooting call. Their fey nature
also means they have magic powers, which can vary with their specific
environment but always include something related to their hoots. Owlbears get
together to mate and rear their cubs, usually only sticking around only long
enough to accomplish that. If prey is plentiful, they might stay together
longer.</p>

<p>Any creature that crosses an owlbear’s territory is fair game. Some owlbears
drag the carcasses of their prey back to their lairs and hang the leftovers on
nearby trees and bushes in hopes of attracting scavengers who will serve as
future meals.</p>

<p>Owlbears are difficult, but not impossible to tame. All manner of fey, goblins,
and even giants might take them as guards, attack animals, or simply pets. In
fact, with the Fey Beast Tamer theme introduced in the guide to the Feywild, PCs
can also have their own pet owlbears!</p>

<p>Some of the fey skip all the boring animal handling work and use charm spells -
it’s the GM’s call whether that’s a prudent thing to do.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-manual">The Numbers (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>Owlbears are Fey Beasts with average Int score of 2. They have a ground speed of
7, low-light vision with trained Perception. Their attacks are usually with
their claws and beaks, though each variety has a different magic
hoot/screech/call as well.</p>

<p>The MM varieties, as usual, need a damage update.</p>

<h3 id="owlbear">Owlbear</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 8 Elite Brute with 212 HP and size Large. Its basic
attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Claw</strong>, and it can make two of those per standard
action. If both hit, the target is grabbed (escape DC 19 for Acrobatics or 22
for Athlethics).</p>

<p>The owlbear can <strong>Bite</strong> a grabbed target, hitting automatically for enough
damage that even without an update it’s close to what it should be for a limited
attack. It’s a standard action but it’s definitely worth it.</p>

<p>When first bloodied it will emit a <strong>Stunning Screech</strong> as a free action. This
is a Close Burst 1 vs Fortitude which does no damage but stuns on a hit (save
ends). Don’t cluster around it!</p>

<h3 id="winterclaw-owlbear">Winterclaw Owlbear</h3>

<p>This Huge owlbear is likely adapted to live in regions of supernatural winter in
the Feywild. Instead of relying on pure physical power, it uses innate ice
magic. It’s a Level 14 Elite Controller with 280 HP.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>Winterclaw</strong> that does a mix of physical and cold
damage, and slows on a hit (save ends). It can make two of those per standard
action, and if both hit the target is immobilized (save ends) with a slow
aftereffect (save ends).</p>

<p>Its magic call trick is the <strong>Frost Wail</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Fortitude), which
does cold damage and immobilizes (save ends). It recharges when the owlbear is
first bloodied.</p>

<p>With a winterclaw owlbear you’ll want to keep everyone immobilized and
preferably isolated, allowing the other monsters in the encounter to pick the
PCs off one by one.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-vault">The Numbers (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The main difference from the Monster Manual here is that the owlbear’s low-light
vision has been upgraded to full Darkvision. They also have properly updated
damage.</p>

<h3 id="young-owlbear">Young Owlbear</h3>

<p>Essentially a non-elite version of the basic Owlbear, it’s a Level 8 Brute with
106 HP. It fights in exactly the same way, and even has the ability to make two
attacks per turn and grab if both hit.</p>

<p>Its hoot only dazes instead of stunning (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="owlbear-1">Owlbear</h2>

<p>A straightforward update of the MM version. Still a Level 8 Elite Brute with 212
HP, its damage has been updated but no other changes were made.</p>

<h2 id="trained-owlbear">Trained Owlbear</h2>

<p>This Large owlbear likely represents a beast that has been tamed and trained
since hatching. It lacks that primal vigor of the wild variety but has better
teamwork.</p>

<p>Trained owlbears are Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They mostly fight with Reach 2
<strong>Claws</strong> but have a few other tricks.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Thunderous Shrieks</strong> (Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6) do
thunder damage and knock prone on a hit. If an adjacent enemy makes an attack
that doesn’t include the owlbear as a target, it will use a <strong>Guardian Claw</strong> to
attack them as an opportunity action. This deals the same damage as a basic
attack, or a flat 5 damage on a miss.</p>

<p>So these owlbears will run right into the fray and occupy the attention of the
enemy front-line, while their masters further back use magic or ranged
attacks. Pretty straightforward soldier types, though they’ll keep some space
between themselves to avoid friendly fire with the thunder shrieks.</p>

<h2 id="wind-claw-owlbear">Wind-Claw Owlbear</h2>

<p>Likely a subspecies that’s adapted to living in windy mountain passes or similar
environments. They’re Level 11 Elite Controllers with 228 HP.</p>

<p>Wind-claws are surrounded by a <strong>Keening Gale</strong> aura 2 that causes any enemies
ending their turn inside to take 5 damage, and allows the owlbear to slide them
2 squares.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Wind Claws</strong> do physical damage, slide the target 2 squares, and knock
it prone. On a miss the owlbear can still slide the target 1 square.</p>

<p>The ability that lets them attack twice is named <strong>Disembowel</strong> (it’s just
“Double Attack” for everyone else). If both attacks hit, the target is stunned
for a turn. I suppose this would be a literal disemboweling if the target hits 0
HP, otherwise they’re just momentarily stunned at narrowling escaping a
disemboweling.</p>

<p>This owlbear also has a <strong>Beak Snap</strong> that hits a grabbed target automatically,
but it lacks any abilities that grab the target! You can either add this ability
to one of its existing attacks, or use the default Grab attack everyone gets
(vs. Reflex, a hit does no damage but grabs the target).</p>

<p>When the owlbear is first bloodied, it lets loose a <strong>Wind Howl</strong> (close blast 5
vs. Fortitude). A hit does no damage, but pushes the targets 3 squares and
knocks them prone. A miss still pushes them 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="winterclaw-owlbear-1">Winterclaw Owlbear</h3>

<p>This is a straightforward update of the MM Winterclaw Owlbear, with the same
level, the same abilities, and updated damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: 1 owlbear, and a trio of satyrs. These would definitely go the “charm
spell” route for taming the owlbear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: 1 winterclaw owlbear and 3 cyclopes. These would tame them through
unceasing toil, for that is the cyclops way.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I love owlbears! Like otyughs, they’re one of those monsters that are a sure
sign that you’re in a D&amp;D world as opposed to some other fantasy setting. And
sure, they’re dangerous predators in-setting, but there’s something extremely
funny and even cute about the concept of a bear with an owl’s head that goes
“who?”.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they seem to do their job so well that the Monster Vault didn’t
change the original stat blocks at all aside from the damage update.</p>
