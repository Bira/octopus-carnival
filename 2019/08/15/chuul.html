<p>This article is part of a series! You can find all of them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Chuuls are large lobster-like beings with yellowish shells, a semi-upright
posture, and a mass of little red tentacles dangling from their faces. They’re a
mainstain of the Underdark in every edition they appear in, including this
one. They didn’t appear on the Monster Vault, but later on they got a Monster
Vault-style update in Dungeon #192, so we’ll be looking at that as well.</p>

<p>Chuuls are Aberrant Magical Beasts (aquatic). We saw the aquatic keyword
already, back when we read about aboleths, but I don’t think I explained
it. Aquatic creatures suffer no penalties for operating underwater and usually
have a swim speed. They also get bonuses when fighting non-aquatic enemies
underwater.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As magical beasts, chuuls are sapient. They’re not very smart, with Int 4, but
they’re conversant in Deep Speech. They lurk in underwater lakes, still pools
and other sufficiently large bodies of stagnant water, and emerge to snatch prey
with their huge claws.  Chuuls don’t care if that prey is sapient, and will eat
every single part of their bodies except for the brain, whose taste the
creatures dislike. Predictably, this makes them good neighbors to mind flayers,
who will use a chuul pool as a dumping ground for brainless bodies.</p>

<p>The Dungeon article adds a bit more lore. Chuuls live in small groups called
pods, in bodies of still water large enough to support them. They’ll happily use
rivers and seas for long-distance travels, but there’s nothing like an
underground lake or still swamp to settle down and raise your kids. These
creatures only have two ambitions in life: to be left alone and to eat
people. When the first one is frustrated, it means they’re about to satisfy the
second.</p>

<p>Chuuls reproduce by laying sacs of slimy yellow eggs, which they protect
fiercely. Sometimes they’ll attach these sacs to the bottom of ships or
riverboats as a way to help the species propagate further.</p>

<p>As chuuls grow older, they grow bigger and sometimes develop psychic
powers. They also <em>mutate</em> very easily, which makes them a preferred subject for
mind flayer experimentation, and might give even wild chuuls a few extra
interesting traits. Finally, they all share a kind of racial memory. An
individual will remember its previous generation very clearly and have a dimmer
recollection of the ones that came before. One memory from the dawn of time
remains very strong, however: hate humans. Kill them. Devour them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>In both the Monster Manual and the Dungeon article, we get the same two
varieties of this monster:</p>

<p>The classic <strong>Chuul</strong> is a Level 10 Soldier with 109 HP. It’s Large, has
darkvision and both a walking and a swimming speed of 6. Its basic attack is a
claw whose damage is exactly half of what it should be for its level, but that’s
surprisingly okay here because the chuul can make 2 claw attacks per turn
despite not being Elite. These do extra damage against immobilized targets.</p>

<p>If both attacks hit the same target, the Chuul will make a attack against the
victim’s Fortitude using its face tentacles. This does no damage, but
immobilizes on a hit. The tentacles also figure in the Tentacle Net ability, a
passive which automatically immobilizes anyone hit by the chuul’s opportunity
attacks.</p>

<p>The chuul’s ambush predator tactics make it seem like a lurker, but I guess it
doesn’t try to hide again after first emerging, though it prefers to stick to
the water. The Dungeon/Monster Vault version has better claw damage, but is
still largely the same.</p>

<p>Next we have the <strong>Chuul Juggernaut</strong>, a Level 23 Elite Soldier with 434 HP
that’s either very old or was experimented on by mind flayers. It’s Huge, has
ground and swim speeds of 7 and also psychic powers! Psychic Lure is a ranged 10
attack against Will that does psychic damage and pulls the target 5 squares on a
hit. The Juggernaut otherwise fights like the classic model, but is much less
shy about leaving the water. We’re back to having to fix its damage: as an elite
it’s supposed to make two full-damage attacks and not two half-damage ones. This
damage fix is exactly what the Dungeon version does, being otherwise identical.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>The first is level 10, 2 chuuls, a feymire crocodile, and a bog hag. Just to
show you these things also live on the surface and associate with people that
are not mind flayers.</p>

<p>The second is level 23, a chuul juggernaut and three blood fiends. I got nothing
on this one.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The chuul lore in the MM didn’t exactly spark joy, y’know? The additions from
the update make them more interesting in that front. Mechanically they’re solid
opposition, as evidenced by the fact that the update didn’t do more than
increase their damage a bit.</p>
