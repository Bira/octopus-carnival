<p>Steve Jackson has another kickstarter for DFRPG going! While the main goal for
this one is the creation of a second monster book for the game, they’ve also
bundled in the costs of reprinting the wonderful physical box set for the
original game.</p>

<p>You see, they’re using this particular campaign as a way to gauge player
interest in GURPS. If it funds successfully, they’ll commit to doing “big” books
for the GURPS as a whole in the future. If it doesn’t, then support will
continue only in the form of small PDF supplements, one or two a month.</p>

<p>By the look of things, the project <em>will</em> fund, but only just. So if like GURPS
and haven’t thought about pledging to it yet, go to the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/warehouse23/powered-by-gurps-dungeon-fantasy-monsters-2-and-ga">campaign page</a> and
do it! For only US$10 you’ll get the PDF of the new book, and there are pricier
options for people who want physical copies or other books as well.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t play DFRPG specifically, you’ll still get some mileage out of
a bestiary, which is the sort of book people always complain is missing from
GURPS. And if you <em>do</em> play it, then what you have is a win-win situation right
there.</p>

<p>If you have no idea what GURPS Dungeon Fantasy is all about (unlikely, if you’re
reading this blog), you can see this <a href="http://www.gamesdiner.com/2019/03/31-reasons-why-you-want-to-pick-up-dungeon-fantasy-roleplaying-game-and-fast">excellent post</a> with no less than 31
reasons why it’s awesome.</p>

<p>The PDF of the game itself is available at <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/products/dungeon-fantasy-roleplaying-game">Warehouse 23</a> for US$40 (you have
to choose PDF in the format dropdown there). Forty American dollars might sound
like a lot, especially if you’re reading this in Brazil, but this is actually
less than the price of a single D&amp;D core book. And it gives you a full fantasy
game that’s better than D&amp;D (yes, I went there)!</p>
