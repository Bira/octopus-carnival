    <p>I’ve been playing a lot of Ace Combat 5 and 7 lately, so I have fighter jets in
the brain. And today I learned something I’d never have thought was possible
from looking at the way those games or RPGs like GURPS model them.</p>

<p>Apparently, modern fighter planes are so fast they can shoot <em>themselves</em> down
by outrunning their own cannon fire! Implausible, you say? Well, if you read
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/04/dutch-f-16-takes-cannon-fire-from-itself/#p3">this bit of news</a> you’ll see that it actually happened in January of this
year with an F-16, and that there are records of at least one other incident
from back in 1956 with a Grumman F-11.</p>

<p>The gist of it is that shells are fired from the aircraft’s cannon at a speed
equal to that of the aircraft plus their muzzle velocity, as you’d
expect. However, they’re quickly slowed down by drag, so it’s possible for a
plane flying at high speeds to accelerate past the bullets it just fired and
maneuver itself into a position to be hit by them.</p>

<p>GURPS and most RPGs just tend to treat projectiles as having infinite speed. A
character shoots, and the bullet flies out to its maximum range before the end
of that character’s turn. This is a pretty decent approximation for the type of
combat that usually happens in these games, which is between people on foot and
at relatively short ranges. <strong>GURPS Tactical Shooting</strong> does have some
additional rules for projectile flight time, but those are optional and mostly
meant for snipers<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. None of the existing rule sets contemplates the speed and
ranges involved in jet age air combat.</p>

<p>Do we need specific rules for this hazard? I would say not. It’s even more of a
niche situation than long-range sniping, and the bookkeeping required to track
it would not be all that fun even in a realistic game about air combat. No, what
we have here is an <em>excellent</em> result to use if someone rolls a critical failure
on a Gunnery or Pilot test. Even if you go on to become the Ace of Aces, your
squadron-mates will forever embarass you with stories of that one time you shot
yourself down.</p>
