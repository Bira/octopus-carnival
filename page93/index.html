<p>Sahuagin have been in the game since at least AD&amp;D 1. Here, they are present in
the Monster Manual, and get an update in Dungeon 193.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Back when I talked about Kuo-Toa, I mentioned I had a hard time distinguishing
between the various types of “fish people with spears”. At last, we have a
chance to figure out what makes kuo-toa and sahuagin different.</p>

<p>Sahuagin are also known as sea devils because they tend to be murderously
hostile to everyone who isn’t them. These fish people are said to share several
characteristics with sharks (though you can’t really see it in the
illustration).</p>

<p>They build settlements in coastal waters using materials like stone and
coral. These range in size from small villages to cities with six thousand
inhabitants or more. Sahuagin society is patriarchal and heavily hierarchic:
each village is ruled by a baron; princes rule groups of up to twenty villages;
and each sahuagin kingdom is ruled by a king living in one of those cities.</p>

<p>These kingdoms seem to claim both their surrounding waters and the nearby coasts
as territory. Though sahuagin sometimes trade with other people living in this
territory, they’ll almost always raid their settlements and ships instead,
taking what they want.</p>

<p>Sahuagin are deeply religious and I guess a lot of their orneriness comes from
their choice of deity: they venerate Sekolah, a shark god who is one of Melora’s
exarchs. Female sahuagin have an hierarchy of their own that emphasizes their
role as priests, teachers, and loremasters. The main tenets of their culture and
religion can be summed up as: “always be the hunter and not the hunted”; “if an
action is successful, then it is right” and “meat is meat”. That last bit means
they have no qualms about eating anyone, even their own when they get too weak
to hunt.</p>

<p>Despite such brutal teachings Sekolah is still a god. Both it and its favored
people hate demons with a passion, particularly Demogorgon and Dagon. So yeah,
there might come a time when the party finds itself on the same side of a battle
as a bunch of sahuagin.</p>

<p>One last bit the MV touches on is that the sea devils are very prone to genetic
mutation, so lots of them have some deviation from the “typical” sahuagin
form. Some of these are very prized, such as the one that gives an individual
four arms and marks them as suitable for the mantle of nobility. A rare and
reviled mutation is the one that produces “malenti”, sauhagin so deformed and
ugly by the standards of their society that they almost resemble greenish sea
elves. Considered pariahs in saghuagin society, they’re employed as ambassadors
and spies to people who think they’re pretty. Their true mission is almost
always to set up a backstab rather than to engage in any diplomacy in good
faith.</p>

<p>So, in the end, what distinguishes a sahuagin from a kuo-toa? Both are deeply
religious and universally hostile fish people who like hafted weapons, but:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sahuagin inhabit the surface world, Kuo-toa the Underdark.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sahuagin use tridents, kuo-toa use spears and harpoons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sahuagin worship Sekolah, Kuo-toa worship aboleths and/or some cthulhoid
entity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sahuagin are scaly, kuo-toa are slimy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sahuagin have pretty infiltrators, kuo-toa do not.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Another difference is mechanical: kuo-toa are levels 14-16, while sahuagin are
levels 6-10. So there is a kind of power ladder for fish people too.</p>

<p>Most sahuagin are Medium Natural Humanoids, though the four-armed nobles are
Large. All have the Aquatic keyword, low-light vision, a land speed of 6 and a
swim speed of 6 or 8.</p>

<p>Most sahuagin fight with tridents, which can be used in melee or thrown. The MM
version has range 3/6 when thrown, and the MV version has range 5. The MM makes
it explicit that the trident must be retrieved to be used in melee again, since
most sahuagin only carry a single one into combat. It wouldn’t be hard to say
they have two so they can thrown one as they approach.</p>

<p>Their signature ability is <strong>Blood Frenzy</strong>, which gives them a +1 to attacks
and +2 to damage against bloodied enemies, and is an extra incentive for them to
gang up on such targets.</p>

<p>Aside from the updated damage, the stat blocks from Dungeon are identical to
the MM originals.</p>

<p>I’m including a small bonus here: a stat block for sharks. Though the Monster
Manual lore for sahuagin mentions sharks several times, it includes no stats for
sharks anywhere within it, leaving that as an exercise to the reader. The
Monster Vault, despite not containing sahuagin, has stats for sharks in its
animal appendix.</p>

<h3 id="shark-mv">Shark (MV)</h3>

<p>This can stand in for any species of shark large and aggressive enough to target
humans or pal around with Sahuagin. It’s a Medium Natural Beast with the Aquatic
keyword, and a Level 5 Brute with 75 HP. It swims with speed 8, and if the PCs
ever push it into dry land it will only be able to flop around at speed 1
(clumsy). It has low-light vision, though you should probably give it some form
of blindsense as well if you want to be realistic.</p>

<p>Sharks attack with a <strong>bite</strong>, of course, and the <strong>Aquatic</strong> trait means
they’ll pretty much always have a +2 attack bonus on that. They also have a
<strong>Blood Frenzy</strong> trait which gives them a further +2 to attacks and +4 to damage
against bloodied creatures.</p>

<h3 id="sahuagin-guard">Sahuagin Guard</h3>

<p>These are Level 6 Minion Brutes, with all the standard traits above. Their swim
speed is 6.</p>

<p>Like pretty much all sahuagin, they fight with <strong>tridents</strong>, which can be used
in melee or thrown, and have no other special attacks.</p>

<h3 id="sahuagin-raider">Sahuagin Raider</h3>

<p>A non-minion version of the Guard, it’s a Level 6 Soldier with 70 HP. It fights
with the same weapons and tactics, and has an extra ability: <strong>Opportunistic
Strike</strong>, a reaction that allows it to attack a flanked enemy that shifts.</p>

<p>They’ll cooperate with other raiders and melee monsters to keep enemies
flanked.</p>

<h3 id="sahuagin-priest">Sahuagin Priest</h3>

<p>Priests are level 8 Artillery with 70 HP. They have all standard traits and
their swim speed is 8.</p>

<p>They have the usual <strong>trident</strong> that can be used in melee or thrown, but they
also have much better ranged options. <strong>Water Bolt</strong> (ranged 10 vs. AC) does
physical damage, and has double the range and a damage bonus when used
underwater. <strong>Spectral Jaws</strong> (ranged 20 vs. Will) makes shark jaws appear and
bite into the target. This does a good chunk of physical damage, and inflicts
both ongoing physical damage and a -2 penalty to all defenses (save ends
both). It recharges when the target makes its save.</p>

<p>All of those magic attacks benefit from Blood Frenzy, by the way.</p>

<h3 id="sahuagin-baron">Sahuagin Baron</h3>

<p>Barons are Large, and have four arms. They’re Level 10 Elite Brutes with the
Leader keyword, 256 HP, and a swim speed of 8. They emit a <strong>Blood Healing</strong>
aura 10 that heals every ally inside that starts its turn adjacent to a bloodied
enemy for 5 HP.</p>

<p>Barons fight with the usual <strong>trident</strong> but also with their <strong>claws</strong>, which
count as a second basic attack. <strong>Baron’s Fury</strong> allows them to attack with the
trident and two claws per standard action.</p>

<p>Barons upgrade the usual Blood Frenzy to <strong>Blood Hunger</strong>, which gives them +2
to attacks and +5 to damage rolls against bloodied enemies.</p>

<p>We get no stats for princes or kings, but it’s possible they’d use the baron
stats, maybe with a few added levels.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Most sahuagin encounters will be against all-sahuagin groups, since they’re
pretty xenophobic. The main exception, surprisingly, is vampires: they and the
sahuagin apparently bond over their shared love of blood. Underwater encounters
might involve pet sharks, too.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Rust Monsters are a D&amp;D original, inspired by some cheap plastic “dinosaur”
figures Gygax had lying around and intended to use as miniatures. In 4e they
first appear in the Monster Manual 2 and later in the Monster Vault, so we’ll be
peaking ahead a bit.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Rust monsters came about naturally, even though plenty of people swear they were
created by a spiteful god who thought mortals had too much shiny stuff. Everyone
hates these things.</p>

<p>Rust monsters feed on metal, by secreting powerful enzymes which dissolve it and
slurping the slurry. Normally they target ore veins and leech the metal out of
them, but items made of processed metal draw them like blood in the water draws
sharks. Since food is usually scarce, rust monsters tend to have only one or two
young per brood, but when they find a plentiful source of metal like a lode or a
civilized settlement, their broods increase in size to make use of that bounty.</p>

<p>It’s not just adventurers who curse these creatures! They get into civilized
settlements and mines and eat away at all the metal tools, fittings, and support
beams if you let them. Some dwarf and duergar settlements develop complex wards
to keep them at bay, but their effectiveness is limited - some rust monsters
have a knack for finding holes in them.</p>

<p>The bright side of all of this is that rust monsters can be a source of
residuum, that precious substance which is used to fuel magic rituals and
enchant items. You see, most of them can’t digest magic, so any magic
impregnating the metal they eat ends up stored in their bodies as clumps of
residuum. This is enough incentive for some people to go out hunting rust
monsters, despite the risks to life, limb, and loot.</p>

<p>Some rust monsters <em>are</em> able to digest residuum, which causes them to grow much
larger and to crave magic as much as they do metal. These enhanced monsters are
known as Dweomer Eaters.</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-residuum">A Note on Residuum.</h3>

<p>Residuum gets introduced in the PHB, so I haven’t talked about it too much
here. It’s basically concentrated, crystalized magic: I imagine it as
rainbow-colored sparkly dust. The rules measure it by its monetary value (for
example, “100gp worth of residuum”), so I imagine it’s extremely valuable for
its weight and only found in tiny quantities.</p>

<p>When you disenchant a magic item using a ritual from the PHB, you get a fifth of
its monetary value back as residuum, which ensures you can always get some
benefit even from items no one in the party wants. The substance can be used in
place of the traditional components for any ritual, no matter what its power
source is. And of course, Enchant Item is a ritual, so you can use it to make
other magic items as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Most rust monsters are Medium Natural Beasts, though Dweomer Eaters are
Large. They have low-light vision.</p>

<p>In earlier editions rust monsters could destroy metal weapons, armor and items
instantaneously, but this has become a more gradual process in 4e. Even so the
MM2 has this big box about being careful with rust monsters, because players
loathe losing their magic loot even more than they fear losing their
PCs.</p>

<p>Usually, at most one of the party’s items risks total destruction at the
antennae of a rust monster per fight, though that danger multiplies if you’re
fighting more than one and the penalties it inflicts can make fighting the other
monsters in the encounter more difficult than they would otherwise be.</p>

<h3 id="rust-monster-both">Rust Monster (Both)</h3>

<p>Basic rust monsters are Level 6 Skirmishers with 66 HP. Their speed is 8, so you
can’t easily run from them once they catch the scent of your expensive gear.</p>

<p>A rust monster’s <strong>bite</strong> does physical damage and rusts any heavy armor the
target might be wearing. Rusting armor has a -1 penalty to AC, and multiple
bites increase this to a maximum of -5. This only lasts until the end of the
encounter.</p>

<p><strong>Rusting Defense</strong> means attacking the monster with a metal weapon also rusts
it, which inflicts a -1 penalty to attack rolls and is cumulative to a maximum
of -5.</p>

<p>Rusted weapons and armor return to normal after the end of the encounter, so
this is not quite as bad as it looks. However, the monster can target a rusting
weapon or suit of armor with its <strong>Devour Metal</strong> ability (melee 1 vs. Reflex),
which destroys the item in question on a hit!</p>

<p>If the destroyed item was magical, you’ll be able to retrieve residuum from the
monster’s belly equal to the full value of the item, which doesn’t necessarily
ensure you’ll get your item back but is still a bit of a consolation prize.</p>

<p>The main difference between books, aside from the usual damage update, is in how
Devour Metal works. The MM2 version only affects magic items of 10th level or
less (or nonmagic items), and is an encounter power. The MV version is actually
more dangerous: it has no level limit and recharges when the monster misses with
it, which means it can keep trying until it manages to destroy something.</p>

<p>Fighting a rust monster still produces that funny inversion effect where the
squishies wearing cloth and bearing wooden weapons move to the front line and
the fighters cower in the back, but now the fighters aren’t instantly doomed the
moment the monster slips by the squishies.</p>

<h3 id="gluttonous-rust-monster-mv">Gluttonous Rust Monster (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 8 Brute has 110 HP, Speed 6, and all the abilities of the basic rust
monster above.</p>

<p>In addition, it has a <strong>Gluttonous Bite</strong> encounter power (melee 1 vs. AC) which
does more damage than the basic bite and rusts the target’s weapon and armor at
the same time. On a miss, it does half damage.</p>

<h3 id="young-rust-monster-swarm-both">Young Rust Monster Swarm (Both)</h3>

<p>This is what you get when a couple of rust monsters nests close to a large
source of metal. The swarm is a Level 9 Soldier with 92 HP. As a swarm, it takes
half damage from single-target attacks and 10 extra damage from area effects. It
can also squeeze through any opening wide enough to allow a single rustling
through.</p>

<p>The swarm has <strong>Rusting Defense</strong> and its <strong>Swarm of Bites</strong> also rusts
armor. Its <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura 1 deals 5 damage to enemies caught inside and,
if they have a rusting item on them, slows them for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="dweomer-eater-mm2">Dweomer Eater (MM2)</h3>

<p>Dweomer Eaters are Large, and Level 11 Skirmishers with 110 HP. They work pretty
much like standard rust monsters, with bigger numbers. There is one important
difference, though: their rusting abilities target not metal, but <em>magic</em>.</p>

<p>This means that any magic armor or weapon used by the party, no matter what
material it’s made from, is at risk when fighting a dweomer eater. Mundane items
are fine, but that is scant consolation for a level 11 party typically clad in
+2 or +3 armor and weapons. Yes, if you hit them with spells channeled through a
magic implement, the implement rusts even if it’s made of wood or crystal.</p>

<p>You can still extract residuum equal in value to any items destroyed by a
dweomer eater from its corpse, at least.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The encounters we have in the MM2 place rust monsters alongside creatures which
don’t usually employ metal weapons, such as lizardfolk that fight unarmed or
with magic, and certain faeries. I don’t think you can train a rust monster not
to eat your metal weapons, so people who rely on steel won’t be using them as
pets.</p>

<p>I like rust monsters! The original versions terrified me as a player, but the
kinder implementation here feels just right. A single mistake won’t cost you
your hard-won loot, and the GM gets to have a bit more fun by prolonging the
dread.</p>

<p>PCs with Enchant Item can make magic items with a maximum level equal to their
own, so the residuum refund from a slain rust monster makes the loss of such an
item temporary. You usually find items of a higher level than that as treasure,
though. The Essentials rules also introduce the concept of item rarity, which
makes certain items impossible to re-create via ritual. Both of these things
mean some losses are indeed permanent or at least very difficult to replace.</p>

<p>I think rot harbingers first appeared in 3e as Angels of Decay, in one of its
undead-focused supplements. Here, they are only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In 4e, rot harbingers are still sometimes called angels of decay, though that’s
the less common name for them. Though they resemble angels, the two are not
directly related.</p>

<p>Rot harbingers are one a type of undead that were never alive in the first
place. Once upon a time Orcus decided to travel outside the Abyss for reasons
that have been lost to time. The gods took this opportunity to try and kill him,
and sent a host of angels to do the deed. The angels failed, and all of them
perished at the claws of the demon lord. When Orcus returned to the Abyss, he
made the first rot harbingers from nothing as a kind of “fuck you” to the gods
that tried to kill him.</p>

<p>Most such monsters still serve Orcus, but some have managed to escape his
control and find new employment with other masters. All of them are quite
unpleasant, with their lust for inflicting agony and death being literally the
thing that keeps them animate.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Rot harbingers are Medium Elemental Humanoids with the Undead keyword. They’re
immune to disease and poison, have 10 necrotic resistance, and aren’t specially
vulnerable to radiant energy. They run at speed 6 and fly at speed 8
(clumsy). We get two stat blocks here, and they’re simple enough that I’m not
going to give them their own sub-sections.</p>

<p>The standard <strong>Rot Harbinger</strong> is a level 20 soldier with 193 HP. It fights with
its claws, which mark for a turn and do ongoing necrotic damage (save ends) in
addition to their standard physical damage. That’s their only attack.</p>

<p>There’s also the <strong>Rot Slinger</strong>, which is level 22 Artillery and has 165
HP. Its claws also do ongoing necrotic damage, and it fights at range by
shooting Orbs of Decay (Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) which do necrotic damage,
weaken, and inflict a -2 penalty to saves (save ends both).</p>

<p>They’re best used in groups, with standard harbingers providing a serviceable
front line and the slingers hanging back. They pair well with monsters that
inflict (save ends) effects, due to the penalty they inflict.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h3>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 21: 1 deathpriest hierophant, 3 slaughter wights, and 2 rot harbingers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 2 harbingers, 2 slingers, and a voidsoul specter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, Thanatos is probably crawling with these things, and they make
perfect servants to high level necromancer types even if those necromancers
aren’t part of the Orcus franchise. They’re good candidates for the “regular
foot-soldier” monster in an all-undead epic adventure.</p>

<p>Ropers are D&amp;D originals as far as I know, and have been in the game since at
least AD&amp;D first edition. They’re one of a number of monsters meant to look like
innocuous bits of scenery which Gygax and other authors likely invented as their
players became savvy to their usual opposition. They’re on both the Monster
Manual and the Vault in this edition.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Ropers are ambush predators who live in the Underdark and sometimes in caves
closer to the surface. Their rocky skin and conical shape makes them very
similar to the sort of geological formation you can find in these environments,
and they can slowly crawl and position themselves in either cavern floors or
ceilings. Unlike many Underdark denizens, their distant origins lie in the
Elemental Chaos rather than in the Far Realm. They’re technically earth
elementals!</p>

<p>A roper will sit tight and look like a stalactite/stalagmite until some likely
prey wanders into the reach of its long tentacles, at which point they’ll whip
out, grab the victim, and pull them into the creature’s maw. Aside from their
natural camouflage and weapons, ropers have another thing going for them:
they’re sapient and actually fairly intelligent. While most will eat anything
and anyone, some have specific tastes in prey, such as humans or elves.</p>

<p>In both cases, a roper might make deals with other creatures that live near its
chosen hunting grounds, promising not to eat them in exchange for being allowed
to position itself at a prime spot in their territory. If that territory gets
invaded (either by one of the many hostile Underdark factions or by PCs), the
roper and its allies will generally cooperate in its defense, with the roper
getting to eat the bodies later.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Ropers are Large Elemental Magical Beasts with the Earh keyword. They all have
darkvision and are immune to petrification. They have ground and climb speeds of
only 2, with Spider Climb allowing them to stick to ceilings. This means they’re
not going to be moving much during a fight, but they can position themselves
just fine outside of it.</p>

<p>All ropers can do something grabby with their tentacles and something horrible
to grabbed victims, but the exact mechanics vary per stat block. Tentacles
usually have a fantastic melee reach of 10.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual only has the one roper stat block, but the MV has
three. We’ll look at them in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="impaling-roper-mv">Impaling Roper (MV)</h3>

<p>A relatively simple creature compared to its relatives, the Impaling Roper is a
Level 10 Lurker with 84 HP and the standard traits described above. It’s trained
in Stealth.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Tentacles</strong> (melee 10 vs. Reflex) do very little damage, but also grab on
a hit (escape DC 26). Grabbing a victim grants the roper Resist 20 to all of
that victim’s attacks for a turn. Anyone (including the victim) can attack the
grabbing tentacle, which has the same defenses as the roper. A hit here does no
damage but causes the creature to release the victim.</p>

<p>If the victim is still grabbed when the roper’s next turn comes up, it can
<strong>Impale</strong> them (melee 10 vs. Reflex). A hit pulls the victim adjacent to the
roper, does a ton of physical damage, and ends the grab. A miss does the same
thing, but only half damage.</p>

<p>I’m guessing this roper looks more like a round spiky rock than the usual
conical shape.</p>

<h3 id="cave-roper-mv">Cave Roper (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 12 Elite Controller with 252 HP and all standard roper
traits. It’s pretty much the classic roper.</p>

<p>Cave ropers have a couple of passive traits: <strong>Tentacle Release</strong> is the same
“attack the tentacle to free a victim” mechanic we had as part of the Impaling
Roper’s basic attack. <strong>Stony Body</strong> is what allows the roper to disguise itself
as a rocky formation by closing its eye and retracting its tentacles. The
Perception DC for spotting the ruse is 28.</p>

<p>The roper’s <strong>Tentacles</strong> (melee 10 vs. reflex) do level-appopriate damage and
grab the target with a DC 20 escape DC. While grabbed, the target is also
weakened. With <strong>Double Attack</strong> it can make two tentacle attacks in an action.</p>

<p>They can also <strong>Bite</strong> an adjacent grabbed victim, an attack vs. AC that does a
ton of damage on a hit and half that on a miss. This roper’s bites <em>don’t</em> end
the grab.</p>

<p>To bring those victims within bite range, the roper can use minor actions to
<strong>Reel</strong> them in, an attack vs. Fortitude that pulls the victim 5 squares on a
hit.</p>

<h3 id="roper-mm">Roper (MM)</h3>

<p>The Monster Manual roper is a Level 14 Elite Controller with 284 HP. It’s
functionally identical to the Cave Roper above, with the main differences being
from mechanical adjustments between books. The DC to spot its Sony Body disguise
is 30, and since there’s no listed DC to escape is grabs, you have to use either
its Fortitude of 29 or its Reflex of 21 depending no which skill you choose.</p>

<p>There’s nothing here you can’t get in a better format by leveling up a cave
roper to level 14.</p>

<h3 id="crag-roper-mv">Crag Roper (MV)</h3>

<p>Crag Ropers are Level 15 Elite Soldiers with 304 HP. They have all the standard
traits mentioned above, plus the usual Stony Body (DC 30 to spot). They also get
a <strong>Lashing Tentacles</strong> aura 5 to support their soldierly role: any enemy inside
is considered marked.</p>

<p>I think there might be some mistake in the crag roper’s attacks. Their
<strong>tentacles</strong> skip the grabbing mechanics and just pull the target 5 squares in
addition to doing damage. However, their <strong>bites</strong> can only target grabbed
targets, and they have a <strong>Reel</strong> ability, both of which work like the cave
roper’s. They can also make two tentacle attacks per action.</p>

<p>As written, the crag roper has a hard time using either Reel or its bite, since
it has to resort to a generic, damage-less grab action to grab someone. I would
suggest either replacing the pull effect from the tentacles with a grab, or
removing both Reel and the targetting restriction from the bite, making it into
a Melee 1 attack with the same stats and effects.</p>

<p>The crag roper’s final attack is <strong>Tentacled Retaliation</strong>, a reaction that
triggers when a marked enemy tries to ignore the roper’s mark and attack someone
else. It gives the monster a free tentacle attack against the enemy.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions.</h2>

<p>We have two level 14 encounters in the MM, one with a roper collaborating with a
mind flayer and its two war troll thralls, and one with a drow war party. This
tells us ropers will work with anyone who gives them a good deal, and have no
specific allegiance to any of the big Underdark factions.</p>

<p>Ropers are fine, I suppose, but I never really saw them as the sort of monster
that absolutely must be present in a book. Even though I kinda get the editorial
intention of the Monster Vault, I’m still a bit baffled as to why it dedicates
so much space to the roper as opposed to, say, fomorians, which are not present
here at all.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/10/27/stormtrooper-armor.html">The Stormtrooper Armor Conundrum</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Do you know what is the second hardest thing to convert when adapting Star Wars
to the tabletop? Stormtroopers<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. From an in-character perspective they vastly
outnumber and outgun the scrappy rebel protagonists, with deadly blaster
carbines and that iconic heavy armor. Yet in the actual narrative they almost
never hit a shot and always get taken out in one hit from one of the heroes.</p>

<p>Their poor aim has actually made it into GURPS as an optional cinematic rule
named “Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy”, which reduces the deadliness
of enemy shooters. But the armor thing has tied people’s brain in knots, because
it can’t be explained away with a joke. Why does their armor do nothing?</p>

<p>There are almost as many explanations and solutions to this as there are Star
Wars adaptations. Some say “all armor is bad, actually” and have PCs rely on
plot protection. Some have an armor system but go out of their way to explain
why trooper suits specifically are actually bad. And some have an armor system
that rates trooper armor highly but then go on to state that fun shootouts from
the movies are lies and legends.</p>

<p>Me, I think I hit on a solution that allows me to keep those fun fights while
still having armor be cool.</p>

<h2 id="imperial-stormtrooper-armor-drills">Imperial Stormtrooper Armor Drills</h2>

<p>This is a cinematic rule meant for science fiction settings where highly
effective armor is common, but you want the PCs to have fun battles against
armies of heavily-armored mooks. Star Wars and stormtroopers are the most
obvious examples, but it also works for settings such as Waframe’s with its
Grineer soldiers.</p>

<p>Under this rule, armor worn by “mook” or “fodder” enemies has no protective
value, and is mostly a cosmetic detail! Any solid hit will take them down,
regardless of whether it would have penetrated their DR under standard
rules. Armor worn by PCs and other important characters still uses all the
default rules.</p>

<p>This allows you to frame a particularly badass trooper as a real threat and have
them survive several attacks without giving them different protective gear. It
also allows PCs to loot armor from a fallen mook and have it actually provide
benefit beyond a temporary disguise.</p>

<p>Optionally, you could perhaps take this a bit further and subject certain
stormtroopers to the Inverse Ninja Rule. See a full platoon of troopers gunning
for you? Easy. See <em>one</em> trooper approaching? Danger!</p>
