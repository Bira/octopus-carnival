            <p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Beholders appeared in the first Monster Manual, and I covered them
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/27/beholder.html">here</a>. The Monster Manual 2 brings us a few more varieties, including some
that also made it into the Monster Vault.</p>

<p>Each of the three beholder varieties here gets its own bit of lore, so let’s
combine that with their numbers below.</p>

<p>As before, beholders are Aberrant Magical Beasts. They have All-Around Vision
and Darkvision, and a variable fly speed with hover capability. In general their
attacks consist of a very weak bite and a whole bunch of thematic ranged attacks
from their eye stalks and central eye. Beholder eye rays are Ranged, but don’t
provoke opportunity attacks.</p>

<h3 id="beholder-gauth">Beholder Gauth</h3>

<p>This one appeared in the Monster Vault, and so we discussed them a bit
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/27/beholder.html">here</a>. Gauths are the least of their kind, but they’re still as unpleasant
and power-hungry as any beholder. Their relative weakness means they often don’t
end up on the top of whatever evil org chart they join, and so they are
constantly scheming to rise in its ranks. They’re the most Starscream-like of
beholders.</p>

<p>Gauths also like to capitalize on the fearsome reputation of their larger
relatives, so people who don’t know better might confuse them for the more
dangerous varieties.</p>

<p>I already covered the Monster Vault version of gauths in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/27/beholder.html">post on MM1
beholders</a>. The Monster Manual 2 is pretty much identical, except it suffers
from the damage bug and has a remarkably weak bite. Just use the MV stats for
this one.</p>

<h3 id="beholder-eye-of-frost">Beholder Eye of Frost</h3>

<p>A counterpart to the MM1’s <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/27/beholder.html">Eye of Flame</a>, this is a beholder with a great
affinity for elemental ice. It prefers to dwell in very cold climates in the
world and Elemental Chaos, where it keeps company such as ice archons, frost
giants, and oni. Since eyes of frost aren’t that much stronger than these other
ice monsters, they often end up in the same narrative position as gauths,
scheming to gain the power and respect they feel is due to them.</p>

<p>Eyes of Frost are Large and have a fly speed of 6. They’re Level 14 Elite
Artillery with 222 HP. When first bloodied they coat themselves in <strong>Ice
Armor</strong>, increasing their AC and Fortitude by 2 for the remainder of the fight.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> is super weak: 2d6 damage. You’d need to triple this to get it in
line with the new math.</p>

<p>Much more interesting are the eye beams. The <strong>Central Eye</strong> (Ranged 8
vs. Reflex; minor action 1/round) weakens on a hit (save ends). If a target
weakened by this power would become slowed, they become immobilized instead, and
this lasts until they’re no longer weakened!</p>

<p>The Eye of Frost has access to 3 <strong>Eye Rays</strong>, and <strong>Eyes of the Beholder</strong>
allows it to use one of them as a free action against any enemy that starts its
turn within 5 squares of the beholder. That enemy also gains Vulnerable 5 Cold
until the end of the beholder’s next turn. A ray attack can also be done with a
standard action, of course, further increasing the beholder’s rate of fire.</p>

<p>The rays have Range 10, and have the following effects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Freeze Ray</strong>: vs. Fortitude, deals cold damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Telekinesis</strong>: vs. Fortitude, slides 6 squares.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ice Ray</strong>: vs. Fortitude, deals less cold damage than the freeze ray but
also deals ongoing cold damage and immobilizes (save ends both).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Cold resistance on the PCs will go a long way towards making the eye of frost
less dangerous, though its control effects will still be a problem.</p>

<h3 id="beholder-eye-of-chaos">Beholder Eye of Chaos</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a beholder <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/27/beholder.html">Eye Tyrant</a> who dove into the Abyss
in search of the Shard of Ultimate Evil wielded by Tharizdun. Though the
creature never found the shard, it nevertheless emerged from the experience
infused with all sorts of demonic energies, which increased its power and warped
its body and mind. This stat block could represent that individual or one of its
descendants, or perhaps another beholder who thought he could do it better.</p>

<p>Eyes of Chaos are still quite capable of concocting complex schemes and
directing armies of underlings… only now those underlings tend to be demons
more often than not, and those schemes end up having widespread destruction and
bloodshed as either their main goals or as desirable side effects.</p>

<p>This twisted thing is Large, and Level 25 Elite Artillery. It has a pretty
impressive fly speed of 8, which makes it a lot zoomier than your average
beholder.</p>

<p>The <strong>bite</strong> is once again nothing to write home about, despite all those lovely
teeth. The <strong>Central Eye</strong> (Ranged 20 vs. Fortitude) has the traditional
antimagic/enervation effect that forbits the target from using encounter or
daily powers until the end of the beholder’s next turn.</p>

<p>After that we get the six <strong>eye rays</strong>, all Ranged 10:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Telekinesis</strong>: vs. Fortitude, does physical damage and slides 6 squares.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blinding</strong>: vs. Reflex, does physical damage and blinds (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Confounding</strong>: vs. Will, does psychic damage, slides 6 squares, and dazes
(save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Maddening</strong>: vs. Will, does psychic damage and dominates until the end of
the beholder’s next turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fear</strong>: vs. Will, does psychic damage and forces the target to move its
speed away from the beholder by the safest route possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Teleporting</strong>: vs. Reflex, does physical damage and teleports 10 squares.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The usual <strong>Eyes of the Beholder</strong> trait means anyone starting their turn within
5 squares of the beholder gets hit with a random eye ray. When the monster is
first bloodied it releases a <strong>Ripple of Chaos</strong> that allows it to target every
enemy within 5 squares with a random eye ray and then teleport 6 squares.</p>

<p>I kinda want to make a random roll even for the standard-action eye rays with
this critter. For all the randomness, though, it seems the eye ray effects are
actually a bit less exciting than those of a “normal” beholder, since there are
no sudden death effects here.</p>

<h3 id="beholder-ultimate-tyrant">Beholder Ultimate Tyrant</h3>

<figure class="right">

<p>If you manage to talk to the Ultimate Tyrant, it will tell you that it has the
most valid of reasons for hating all other beholders: they’re a bunch of
posers. They were born in the world or otherwise went native, but the Ultimate
Tyrant is part of the original generation that came directly from the Far Realm
and still keeps its connection to that place.</p>

<p>Depending on the particulars of your campaign it might even be <em>the</em> original
beholder. If not, it’s at least among the first to arrive in the world. Perhaps
the only creature that might dispute its claims of OG-ness is the Gibbering Orb.</p>

<p>The Ultimate Tyrant is Huge, and a Level 29 Solo Artillary menace with 1080
HP. This can even make it suitable as a final boss for a campaign that ends in
the mid-epic levels. Its fly speed is 8, again making it a lot faster than the
MM1 beholders. The damage for all of this beholder’s attacks is quite low, and
should likely be at least doubled.</p>

<p>There’s the basic <strong>bite</strong>, and there’s the stuff you’ll actually be using. The
<strong>Central Eye</strong> (Ranged 30 vs. Fortitude; minor action 1/round) does no damage
but dazes and slows on a hit (save ends both). This worsens to a full Stun on
the first failed save. A miss still slows the target (save ends).</p>

<p><strong>Eyes of the Beholder</strong> works as usual, and <strong>Spasmodic Rays</strong> makes it so the
beholder attacks every enemy within 10 squares with an eye ray when it’s first
bloodied and again when it dies.</p>

<p>The <strong>eye rays</strong> themselves are quite scary. Instead of simple ranged attacks,
all of them are Area Burst 1 Within 10, and they still don’t provoke opportunity
attacks. If the standard Eye Tyrant is a slow-moving battleship, the Ultimate
Tyrant is a hyper-mobile orbital laser cannon.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Madness</strong>: vs. Will; does psychic damage and forces the target to make a
basic attack against its nearest ally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Unraveling</strong>: vs. Fortitude; does physical damage and 10 ongoing damage
(save ends). The first failed save causes an additional 1d10 damage; the
second an additional 2d10; the third causes an additional 3d10 and
automatically ends the effect. So if you fail all of your saves, you’ll be
taking a total of 6d10+30 damage over those three turns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Withering</strong>: vs. Fortitude. Does immediate and ongoing necrotic damage
(save ends), with the first failed save also weakening the target. There’s a
(save ends) after the weakening effect, so I’m guessing that’s a separate
save from the ongoing damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Burning</strong>: vs. Reflex. Does immediate and ongoing fire damage, and also
inflicts a -2 attack penalty (save ends both).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Telekinesis</strong>: vs. Fortitude. Slides the target 8 squares and knocks it
prone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Frost</strong>: vs. Reflex. Cold damage, and a -2 penalty to saves until the end
of the beholder’s next turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Petrifying</strong>: vs. Fortitude. Causes slowness (save ends), which worsens to
immobilization (save ends) with the first failed save and with petrification
with the second. Petrification is permanent until cured.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Disintegrate</strong>: vs. Fortitude. Physical damage, and ongoing 15 physical
damage (save ends). There’s also an ongoing 10 damage after-effect, so in
practice passing that first save only reduces the ongoing damage a bit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Attraction</strong>: vs. Reflex; -5 penalty to all defenses, and at the start of
the target’s turn the beholder pulls it 2 squares (save ends). There’s also a
-2 penalty to defenses as an after-effect (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Repulsion</strong>: vs. Reflex. -2 penalty to Reflex, and at the start of the
target’s turn the beholder pushes it 6 squares (save ends). As an after
effect, the target gets pushed 3 squares in the same way (save
ends).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Though the Ultimate Tyrant only has one outright deadly effect among its ray
selection, it has a few other very interesting effects: the increasing ongoing
damage from the Unraveling Ray, the extra-sticky ongoing damage from
Disintegrate, and the first instances I’ve seen of ongoing forced movement!</p>

<p>It bears repeating that <em>all of these are area attacks</em>. Yes, even the
free-action ones from Eye of the Beholder and Spasmodic Ray. This thing is an
army-killer.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get a total of four sample encounters here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: A gauth, 2 barghest savagers, and a goblin underboss. The gauth is
likely the leader here, making the goblins think it’s a fully powered
beholder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: An Eye of Frost, an oni mage and two wyverns. What haunts the cold
mountain at night.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 24: An Eye of Chaos and a Chaos Hydra. That enough chaos for you?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 29: The Ultimate Tyrant and 2 Slaughterstone Hammerers. What if the
kaiju teamed up with the giant robots?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I love beholders and it’s always good to have more. The Eye of Frost feels
weirdly limited in what it can do, like is fiery counterpart in the first MM,
but the Ultimate Tyrant is an absolute unit.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Behirs first appear in AD&amp;D 1st Edition, and are one of the game’s many
“not-quite-dragon” monsters.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Behirs are giant reptilian creatures with serpentine bodies, many legs (8 or 12,
depending on edition), and innate electrical powers. They’re sapient but
anti-social and uninterested in the trappings of civilization. They don’t even
tolerate each other’s presence for longer than absolutely necessary. A behir
mother will eject her young from the lair shortly after they’re born, forcing
them to fend for themselves.</p>

<p>Though a behir makes lairs in pretty much the same places you’d expect to find
dragons, it accumulates neither treasure nor servants. All it wants is to hunt
and be left alone. Like a lot of D&amp;D super-predators it doesn’t usually care
about the sapience of its victims, but it <em>can</em> be reasoned with or bribed if
you can get it to listen to you. Behirs can communicate both in Common and
Draconic.</p>

<p>This means that some people try to recruit behirs into service. Though this can
end badly if the behir’s terms are not met, a successful negotiation will allow
the foolhardy employer to obtain the services of a formidable monster.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Behirs are Huge Natural Magical Beasts, and have Tremorsense 10 and Resist
Lightning 15. They fight with a combination of natural weapons and lightning
attacks, which vary per stat block. They’re Unaligned, and have a typical Int
score of 7.</p>

<h3 id="behir">Behir</h3>

<p>This represents the typical specimen found in the wild. It’s a Level 14 Solo
Soldier with 564 HP. Their ground speed is 7, and they have a climb speed
of 5. In combat they project a <strong>Lightning Storm</strong> aura (5) that causes 5
lightning damage to anyone caught inside.</p>

<p>The behir fights with its <strong>claws</strong> and <strong>bite</strong>, both of which are Reach 3 and
do the same damage. The claw is a basic attack, and the bite does a mix of
physical and lightning damage.</p>

<p>It can also <strong>Devour</strong> a Medium or smaller victim (Reach 3 vs AC), doing bite
damage and swallowing it whole. This counts as a grab! While it lasts the victim
only has line of sight and effect to the behir, and no one else has line of
sight or effect to the victim. A creature can escape the grab by the usual
means, appearing adjacent to he behir, and can also automatically crawl out of a
dead behir as a move action. With a minor action, the behir can sustain the grab
and deal an automatic 15 damage to the victim. Only one victim at a time fits in
its gizzard.</p>

<p>The monster can also use a <strong>Lightning Breath</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Reflex;
recharge 5-6), which does “high” lightning damage and dazes (save ends), and
does half damage on a miss.  Its <strong>Thunderleg Stomp</strong> (close burst 3
vs. Fortitude) does “low” physical damage and knocks targets prone on a hit.</p>

<p>The damage on all of these is too low due to the math bugs: the basic attacks do
an average of 15 damage when they should be doing 22. The tactics section says
behirs begin by swallowing a squishy even if they have to eat a few opportunity
attacks to do it, and then favoring their area attacks unless sorely pressed by
a single character. With a damage upgrade across the board, these tactics are
quite sound, since the Stomp becomes a more viable option.</p>

<p>Being solo monsters, behirs have a neat initiative trick: they don’t roll
initiative at all! Instead, <strong>Lightning Reflexes</strong> gives them three turns per
combat round at initiative counts 30, 20, and 10. This means that the poor
swallowed victim might be looking at 45 automatic damage per round if they fail
to escape the grab on their own turn. Using that first action on Swallow is
definitely a worthy investiment.</p>

<h3 id="behir-bolter-whelp">Behir Bolter Whelp</h3>

<p>A young specimen, not yet fully grown. It’s merely Large, and a Level 8 Solo
Soldier with 352 HP and Resist 10 Lightning. It’s standard damage is 12, and it
should be around 16 with the update. It has a ground speed of 8 and a climb
speed of 5.</p>

<p>The bolter is going to start the fight by targetting a squishy <strong>Knockdown
Rush</strong> (Reach 2 vs. AC; minor action; recharge 4-6), which allows it to charge
and knock the target prone on a hit. Then, since this was a minor action, it’s
going to follow that up with a <strong>claw</strong> or <strong>bite</strong>, which work the same as the
adult’s with smaller numbers and Reach 2.</p>

<p>When the PCs inevitably surround it, the bolder will emit a <strong>Lightning Shock</strong>
pulse (close burst 2 vs. Reflex; recharge 5-6 and when first bloodied) which
does “high” lightning damage, half on a miss. When hit by a melee attack, it can
respond with a claw as a reaction (<strong>Rip-Claw Response</strong>).</p>

<p>Despite being young, the bolter already displays <strong>Lightning Reflexes</strong>, acting
on initiative counts 20, 15, and 5, so with enough luck on those recharge rolls
it can keep bouncing between PCs for a while.</p>

<h3 id="behir-stormsteed">Behir Stormsteed</h3>

<p>This “domesticated” behir was recruited and trained as a mount by storm
giants. It’s a Level 24 Soldier with 229 HP. It has Resisnt Lightning 15, a
ground speed of 8, and replaces the usual climb speed with a Fly speed of 8
(hover). This is explained as the creature having the ability to walk on the
lightning it generates.</p>

<p>The math bug affects the stormsteed particularly hard since it’s an epic
creature. Its standard damage is a woeful 18, and it should be 32!</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> that does a mix of physical and lightning damage,
and it can also use its <strong>Lightning Breath</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Reflex, recharge
4-6) to deal lightning damage all around itself. I wonder if that was meant to
be a blast.</p>

<p>When mounted, the stormsteed can use <strong>Ride The Lightning</strong>, which grants the
rider a +2 to attack with lightning powers, and allows the steed itself to use
Lightning Breath once per turn as a minor action indepentently of the recharge
counter. Perfect for storm giants or someone like a bluespawn godslayer.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get two sample encounters: a level 8 one with a bolter whelp and three
bugbear wardancers, and a level 14 one with an adult, a medusa, and a yuan-ti
incanter. If something even remotely looks like a snake, Zehir has an interest
in it.</p>

<p>Behirs are one of those monsters I never really got into in previous edition. A
closer reading of this MM2 entry does give me a few ideas of how to use them,
but I still can’t say I’m pumped about them.</p>

<p>I think Barghests have been in the game since AD&amp;D 1st Edition, though I don’t
think I have the book in which they first appear. Their exact nature has changed
a bit between editions.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>If you described a barghest as a “goblin werewolf”, you’d get the general idea
across while being almost completely wrong.</p>

<p>Barghests are born randomly in goblinoid populations. The event is rare, and
usually seen as a blessing from Bane. As a result of this reputation and their
own powers, barghests often rise to leadership positions in goblinoid society
when they grow up.</p>

<p>Barghests are shapeshifters, and possess two forms: one is a goblinoid (goblin,
hobgoblin or bugbear), and the other a wolf-like creature. You can’t really
mistake them for either normal goblinoids or wolves, though: the creature is
merely <em>wolf-like</em>, and the other form always has a specific tell that remains
constant across forms. Locks of white hair or a single discolored eye are
common.</p>

<p>Barghests aren’t particularly vulnerable to silver nor are they affected by the
moon. They’re fairly smart and in full control of their actions in all
forms. And they have psionic powers, which usually manifest as some sort of
psychic vampirism they use to sap the minds and vitality of their foes.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Barghests are Small or Medium Natural Humanoids with the Shapechanger
keyword. They have low-light vision and a ground speed of 6 (8 in wolf
form). They can <strong>Change Shape</strong> with a minor action once per round, and have
different basic attacks depending on what their current form is.</p>

<p>They also have some form of harmful psychic power, which varies per stat
block. We have two here, both Medium:</p>

<h3 id="barghest-savager">Barghest Savager</h3>

</figure>

<p>This is a bugbear barghest whose love of violence is exceptional even for a
bugbear. As a leader, it tries to incite its troops to perform frequent raids on
any soft targets it can find.</p>

<p>Savagers are Level 4 Brutes with 63 HP. They fight with a <strong>battleaxe</strong> or with
their wolfish <strong>bites</strong>, and can perform a <strong>Jump Strike</strong> (recharge 5-6) with
either, shifting 3 squares before and after the attack and doing extra damage.</p>

<p>Their mental powers manifest as the <strong>Power Feed</strong> ability (melee 1 vs. Will;
Encounter; Reliable), usable only in wolf form. This does some psychic damage
and allows the barghest to use an encounter or daily power it has seen the
target use this encounter.</p>

<p>The attack bonus for this will be the same as that of the monster’s other
attacks, but damage and other effects will be as if the power had been used by
the original PC. This would make the ability worth using on high-damage powers,
or those with interesting side effects. When the wizard proclaimed his Sleep
spell would end the fight, this was probably not what he had in mind.</p>

<p>The Reliable keyword means the power isn’t spent if the attack misses, so odds
are the monster will be able to use this successfully at least once.</p>

<h3 id="barghest-battle-lord">Barghest Battle Lord</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-barghest-battle-lord.png"/>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This hobgoblin barghest has the makings of a legendary general, commanding his
troops with great tactical acumen and preferring to bait his enemies into
traps. He’s a Level 7 Controller with 82 HP, fighting with a greatsword in
humanoid form.</p>

<p>The wolf form’s <strong>bites</strong> knock the target prone on a hit, and the
<strong>greatsword</strong> makes the battle lord invisible to the target for a turn. In
either form he can use a <strong>Psychic Howl</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will) which does
psychic damage, dazes for a turn, and inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks as an
aftereffect (save ends).</p>

<p>He can also use <strong>Life Feed</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude; encounter) in wolf
form, which does a little bit of necrotic damage and inflicts 5 ongoing necrotic
damage (save ends). Whenever the targets take that ongoing damage, the battle
lord heals 5 HP. So if four PCs are hit the battle lord will heal at the start
of each of their turns, totalling 20 HP per round.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, as a reaction to being hit by a melee attack, the battle
lord can <strong>Get Some Distance</strong>, shifting 2 squares away.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Barghests can be added to any goblin encounter that you think needs an extra
kick. The first few times it happens it might catch the PCs by surprise, but it
will be interesting to find out if they learn to spot the tells. As mentioned in
the lore, barghests will usually occupy leadership positions in whatever group
of goblins they hang out with.</p>

<p>I remember barghests had an extremely complicated backstory in previous
editions, being fiends from the Neutral Evil plane who happened to be able to
shapeshift into goblins and who had a whole complicated hierarchy back home
based on how many souls they had devoured. All of that is gone here, which I
think is for the best in the end. Some goblins can just wolf out and break your
mind with their psychic powers. It’s one of those things that happens.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Finishing our look at the MM2 Archons entry we arrive at Water Archons. All of
the lore we saw on the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/02/03/wir-mm-4e-archons.html">original archon post</a> remains valid here, and as
usual they have some additional bits of specific lore to them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Water archons were literally built to rule the seas in a military campaign, a
task they do very well. They can fight on land just fine, too, and are fond of
using rivers and other waterways as a road network which allows them to move
through enemy territory almost unoposed and stage raids and invasions from
behind their defensive lines. They advance like the tides, pulling back any
enemies who try to escape them. Their gear uses bronze- or brass- colored metal
which is often enameled in blues and greens.</p>

<p>When moving in force, water archons ride around in ships which are themselves
made out of water, shaped by magic. These also work as submarines, being able to
submerge and surface at will and move just as fast in either mode. Not needing
air makes the whole process a lot simpler.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three different stat blocks for water archons. All are Medium Elemental
Humanoids with the Aquatic and Water keywords. They all have a swim speed, of
course. When a water archon is hit by cold damage, it’s also slowed for a
turn. That doesn’t quite balance out its excellent resistances though.</p>

<p>Wather archons have Resist Acid 10, and are immune to disease, poison and <em>all
forced movement</em>. Yep, you read that right. They also get a +2 on saves against
the immobilized, restrained, or slowed conditions. I think this might be the
first time I’ve seen a whole class of “Fuck You, Controller” monsters.</p>

<h3 id="water-archon-shoal-reaver">Water Archon Shoal Reaver</h3>

<p>These are Level 13 Brutes with 159 HP and all standard traits. Their ground
speed is 5 and their swim speed is 7. They’re enthusiastic raiders who fight
with <strong>tridents</strong> that do physical damage and inflict a -2 AC penalty on the
target for a turn.</p>

<p>They can also shoot <strong>water harpoons</strong> (ranged 5 vs. AC; recharge 5-6) which do
more damage than the trident and pull the target adjacent to the archon. You’re
not running away so easily!</p>

<p>If surrounded they’ll use a <strong>whirlpool of tines</strong> (close burst 1 vs. AC;
enemies only; recharges when first bloodied) which does physical damage and
causes targets hit by it to suffer 2 damage for each square they move (save
ends). A miss halves both the immediate damage and the one from the condition.</p>

<h3 id="water-archon-tide-strider">Water Archon Tide Strider</h3>

<p>A surly warrior with big moods and a big spear, the Tide Strider is a Level 15
Skirmisher with 144 HP. Its ground speed is 6, and its swim speed 8. It projects
a <strong>Body Torrent</strong> aura (1) that affects enemies that try to attack the archon
in melee, pushing them 1 square whether they hit or miss.</p>

<p>Its <strong>greatspear</strong> is Reach 2, and if the archon has combat advantage against
the target, it will knock the target prone. It can use a maneuver called <strong>Way
of Water</strong> (recharge 6) to shift 6 squares and make a spear attack at any point
during the move.</p>

<p>Having a line of these behind a line of shoal reavers might make the PCs think
they’re facing a solid phalanx until the tide striders scatter like, well,
water, and shift behind the PC’s front line.</p>

<h3 id="water-archon-waveshaper">Water Archon Waveshaper</h3>

<p>This being is pretty much a water-bender, using a pair of war fans to direct the
waters around it. It’s a Level 16 Controller (Leader) with 157 HP, a ground
speed of 6, and a swim speed of 8.</p>

<p>The waveshaper prefers to stay at a safe distance from the main melee, and
support its archon allies from there. It will bombard the enemy with <strong>Geysers</strong>
(Area burst 2 within 10 vs. Reflex; recharge 5-6) which damage, knock targets
prone, and prevent them from using immediate actions for a turn.</p>

<p>When things get more chaotic, or while it waits for the geyser to recharge, it
will target individual enemies with <strong>Dizzying Whirlpool</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Fortitude) which does a bit more damage and prevents the target from
charging or shifting (save ends).</p>

<p>As a minor action it can use <strong>Ocean Call</strong> (close burst 10; recharges when
bloodied) which allows any allies in range with the Water or Aquatic keyword to
shift 3 squares as a free action and gain 10 temporary HP. All water archons
have both keywords, of course, and so do a lot of other interesting monsters.</p>

<p>If forced into melee, the archon will use <strong>Waveshape</strong> as a basic attack that
damages, knocks prone, and pushes 1 square.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>When not serving the whims of the primordials directly, water archons work for
people with similar appetites for destruction and a similar preference for
watery environments. As long as their masters allow the archons to indulge in
both, they’ll serve loyally.</p>

<p>The sample encounters have troops of archons serving such masters. There’s a
level 12 encounter where the master is a human pirate, and a level 14 one where
it’s an Aboleth Slime Mage from the MM. That last one includes a waveshaper,
whose Ocean Call does also benefit the aboleth.</p>

<p>I like all of the MM2 archons a lot more than I liked the ones from the first
book. Their basic mechanics are a lot more functional, though they still suffer
from the damage bug, and their themes shine clearly through all of their stat
blocks.</p>

<p>Looks like I missed this Monster Manual/Vault article due to a small typo when I
named its draft. With this, the MM/MV reading is truly completed. Click
<a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Wraiths have been in the game since the beginning as a member of the Undead
Power Ladder, where they were the logical progression from wights. Here, they
appear in both the Monster Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Wraiths are still kind of a logical progression from wights, in origin if not
necessarily in power. As mentioned in the wight entry, living beings in the D&amp;D
implied setting are composed of body, soul, and will (also known as the
animus). When someone dies in a place filled with strong necrotic emanations,
their animus might pop free and roam around on its own. This errant animus is a
wraith.</p>

<p>Wraiths perceive the world as if through a heavy shroud. Everything feels cold,
colorless, and gauzy. Bereft of a soul and tormented by vague memories of the
lost life and sensations they can never recover, they quickly descend into a
violent, hateful madness that drives them to attack and slay the
living. “Newborn” wraiths at first behave like they did in life, staying near
the ground and using doors, but soon they learn that gravity and solid barriers
mean nothing to them.</p>

<p>Unlike some other undead we’ve already seen, wraiths don’t originate only from
evil people. All it takes is for the person to die under the “right”
conditions. A wraith who originated from a good and loving husband is just as
violent and dangerous as one that came from a serial killer. In fact, the first
wraith might specifically seek out and kill its former family without even
knowing why.</p>

<p>Wraiths kill using their life-draining touch. The animus of a recently slain
victim will pop free as a brand-new wraith almost instantly. These new wraiths
are weak at first, but if allowed to exist for long enough will reach full
strength. Even if the victim is brought back to life via magic, its wraith
remains - a new animus forms to hold body and soul together. Predictably, this
does nothing to improve the wraith’s mood, and it will hunt its former self
tenaciously.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when a lot of people die suddenly and simultaneously, their tormented
animi coalesce into a single entity known as a Dread Wraith, which is orders of
magnitude more dangerous. Individual wraiths who stick around long enough, and
who kill enough, may also reach an equivalent level of power.</p>

<p>So there you have it. A flying, insubstantial killer who makes more of itself
whenever it kills someone, and who never stops doing that as long as someone is
still alive within reach. As RPG.net member Monsieur Meuble pointed out in his
own Let’s Read of the 3.5 Monster Manual, that’s a recipe for total
extinction. Fortunately for all of existence, wraiths tend to hang out in out of
the way places far from population centers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Most Wraiths are Medium Shadow Humanoids with the Undead Keyword. Dread Wraiths
are Large. All have darkvision. They’re immune to disease and poison,
Insubstantial, and have a fly speed of 6 with Hover and Phasing capability. They
also have 10/tier resistance to necrotic damage. The Monster Manual and Monster
Vault versions differ substantially from this point on.</p>

<p>Monster Manual wraiths compete with needlefang drakes, ghouls, and hobgoblins as
the most annoying and/or deadly monsters a same-level party can fight. They’re
<strong>Insubstantial</strong> and most of them have attacks with a <strong>weakness</strong> rider, which
means your PCs will spend much of the fight doing a quarter of their usual
damage against these monsters. They also have <strong>Regeneration</strong>, which shuts down
for a turn if they take radiant damage but makes them even more durable.</p>

<p>And if a MM Wraith does manage to kill a PC, their <strong>Spawn Wraith</strong> ability will
make another wraith rise from the corpse at the start of the original wraith’s
next turn. This new wraith is identical to its creator and starts out at full
strength. If this ever happens you might very well be looking at the start of a
long, grinding TPK.</p>

<p>MV wraiths attempt to address all of these issues. Their <strong>Insubstantiality</strong> is
the new kind that always takes full damage from force attacks, and it turns off
for a turn if the monster takes radiant damage. They have no regeneration, and
<strong>Spawn Wraith</strong> creates a minion that can’t spawn further wraiths instead of a
full monster. The weakness rider on their attacks has also been replaced by
other effects that retain the same “life-draining” flavor.</p>

<p>The differences between “basic” wraiths are big enough that I’m going to give
each book’s version its own sub-section.</p>

<h3 id="wraith-monster-manual">Wraith (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>Having said all of that about wraiths in general, I have little left to say
about the basic MM wraith. It’s a Level 5 Lurker with 37 HP, Regeneration 5,
Necrotic Resistance 10, and Radiant Vulnerability 5. Radiant damage also shuts
down the regeneration for a turn, as I said above.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Shadow Touch</strong> (vs. Reflex) does necrotic damage and weakens (save
ends). It does extra necrotic damage if the wraith has <strong>Combat
Advantage</strong>. Once per encounter the monster can use <strong>Shadow Glide</strong> to shift 6
squares, and any humanoid killed by it produces another full-strength wraith in
the next turn.</p>

<h3 id="wraith-monster-vault">Wraith (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>Once again, the basic MV wraith is mostly composed of the general traits I
discuss above. It’s a Level 5 Lurker with 53 HP and Resist 10 Necrotic. It lacks
a numeric radiant vulnerability, but radiant damage <em>does</em> make it substantial
for a turn, and it always takes full damage from force attacks. <strong>Spawn Wraith</strong>
produces wraith figments instead of full-strength monsters.</p>

<p>Necrotic damage from the <strong>Shadow Touch</strong> has been substantially increased, and
it further doubles if the wraith was invisible when it started the attack. No
weakness rider, though. <strong>Shadow Glide</strong> is an at-will free action now,
triggered whenever the wraith is damaged by an attack that does neither force or
radiant damage. It causes the wraith to become invisible until it attacks or
until the end of the encounter, allows it to teleport 6 squares, and <em>forbids</em>
it from attacking until the end of its next turn.</p>

<p>That’s a evil lurker mechanic. I like it! An unwary party might think they just
popped a minion the first time this triggers.</p>

<h3 id="mad-wraith-both">Mad Wraith (Both)</h3>

<p>This wraith is different enough from the standard one that it got me wondering
that the explanation for it might be. Then it dawned on me that this is a
renamed Allip, a monster introduced in 3e that was pretty much a wraith with a
stronger insanity theme to it.</p>

<p>This is a level 6 Controller with 54 HP in the MM, and 73 in the MV. Both
versions have all common traits for their books, with Necrotic
Resistance 10. Let’s start with the MV Mad Wraith, which is the better one.</p>

<p>It has a <strong>Mad Whispers</strong> aura (3), which does 5 psychic damage to enemies
caught inside and slides then 2 squares. It also has the standard
<strong>Insubstantial</strong> and <strong>Spawn Wraith</strong> traits.</p>

<p>The mad wraith’s basic attack is the <strong>Touch of Madness</strong> (vs. Will), which does
psychic damage and inflicts a -2 penalty to all defenses (save ends). There’s
also the <strong>Touch of Chaos</strong> (vs. Will; Recharge 5-6) which does the same psychic
damage, slides the target 5 squares, and forces it make a basic attack against
its nearest ally. A miss does half damage and slides the target 2 squares
(without the forced attack).</p>

<p>The MM version has the same attacks, the Monster Manual standard traits (and
problems), and Radiant Vulnerability 5. Its Mad Whispers aura shuts down for a
turn if it takes radiant damage, but otherwise works the same.</p>

<h3 id="wraith-figment-monster-vault">Wraith Figment (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>One of these Level 6 Minion Skirmishers gets created whenever a Monster Vault
wrait kills a humanoid. They have a standard wraith’s senses, resistances and
movement speed, but they lack the Spawn Wraith ability. Their attack is a
<strong>Shadow Caress</strong> (vs. Reflex) that does minion-level necrotic damage and slows
for a turn. They can <strong>Shadow Glide</strong> once per encounter, shifting 6 squares.</p>

<p>Having one of these pop up in a fight is bad news, but not as bad as if they
were full strength wraiths. And story-wise they’re still a potential extinction
event, as they would eventually grow into “proper” wraiths given enough time.</p>

<h3 id="sovereign-wraith-monster-vault">Sovereign Wraith (Monster Vault)</h3>

<p>The strongest MV wraith, it likely belonged to a king or a fighting noble, as it
packs an echo of the sword it wielded in life. It’s a Level 8 Soldier with 89 HP
and all standard wraith traits with 10 necrotic resistance.</p>

<p>Its basic attack uses the <strong>Spectral Sword</strong> (vs. Fortitude), which does
both immediate and ongoing necrotic damage, and also makes the target grant
combat advantage (save ends both). Hit or miss, the target is also marked for a
turn.</p>

<p>The sovereign wraith can also inflict a curse of <strong>Lonely Death</strong> (recharge
4-6), which allows it to make a Spectral Sword attack with an additional rider:
on a hit, all creatures except the wraith become invisible to the target. Which
is kinda terrifying when you think about it.</p>

<h3 id="sword-wraith-monster-manual">Sword Wraith (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>This seems to have the same concept as the Sovereign Wraith at is root, but it’s
a lot higher-level and possesses the same issues as all the other MM wraiths.</p>

<p>Sword Wraiths are Level 17 Lurkers with 90 HP and all MM wraith traits with a
Necrotic resistance of 20 and Vulnerable 10 Radiant. Their speed
is 8. They attack with a <strong>Shadow Sword</strong> (vs. Reflex) that does necrotic damage
and weakens (save ends). They deal extra damage when they have CA, and when they
hit 0 HP they can shift 4 squares and make one last basic attack as a <strong>Death
Strike</strong>, doing extra damage if they hit. This seems like it stacks with the
bonus damage from CA.</p>

<p>They also have the usual <strong>Shadow Glide</strong> and <strong>Spawn Wraith</strong> powers. The
printed tactics for them are “fight until bloodied, then run away to
regenerate”. You might have noticed they have almost the same HP as the MV
Sovereign Wraith, and they also do almost the same damage due to the math
bug. The only issue preventing them from being dropped in late-heroic encounters
is their high defense and to-hit bonuses.</p>

<h3 id="dread-wraith-monster-manual">Dread Wraith (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>This is either an incredibly ancient wraith or one that was formed when hundreds
of people died at once and their animi all fused.</p>

<p>Dread Wraiths are Level 25 Lurkers with 124 HP and all MM wraith traits, with
Resist Necrotic 30, Vulnerable Radiant 15, and Regeneration 20. Their speed is</p>
<ol>
  <li>They’re surrounded by a <strong>Shroud of Night</strong> (aura 5) which weakens all light
inside by one step: bright light becomes dim, dim light becomes darkness.</li>
</ol>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Dread Blade</strong> (vs. Reflex), which does necrotic damage
and weakens (save ends). They do even more extra damage when they have CA, and
when they die they release a <strong>Death Shriek</strong> (close blast 3 vs. Will) which
does psychic damage and dazes (save ends). A miss still does half damage. Shadow
Glide and Spawn Wraith complete their arsenal. Yes, if a dread wraith kills a
PC, they spawn <em>another dread wraith</em>.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s a series of increasingly powerful encounters here, pairing dark
creepers, evistros, an immolith and a death titan with increasingly powerful
varieties of wraith. This section also mentions that wraiths pollute the
surrounding area with necrotic energy by their very presence, so now you know
how those “necrotic-infused” places that keep giving rise to undead get that
way.</p>

<p>The “angry mindless ghost” archetype is useful when designing adventures, but
D&amp;D has always been remarkably redundant in this area. 4e went a ways towards
reducing this redundancy, but it didn’t go all the way since it still gives us
ghosts, specters and wraiths. I did like seeing that the Allip was rolled into
the wraith entry, at least.</p>

<p>Mechanically, you should absolutely use the MV versions instead of the ones in
the Monster Manual. Level up the sovereign wraith and the figments if you need
dread wraiths for the higher levels.</p>
