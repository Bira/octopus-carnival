<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This was the first time I saw these monsters, but it looks like they first
appeared in Heart of Nightfang Spire, one of the modules in the official Third
Edition adventure path.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Mooncalves are creatures native to the Far Realm with innate dimensional travel
powers. They look like giant bat-winged eyeless squids. Their life cycle is a
mystery, but it seems to include regular trips to the middle world, where they
spend a few weeks nesting at the top of a mountain or hill, hunting by night and
resting by day. The Nentir Vale has a lot of mountains and hills, so they often
end up there.</p>

<p>These creatures travel in groups of 2-5 individuals known as “grasps”, and
arrive at the middle world roughly every 8 years. They’re not picky about their
food and will hunt whatever is available. They do like the flesh of humanoids
and their cattle, so if “what’s available” is a village that place will be in
serious trouble while the incursion lasts, and might end up getting abandoned or
decimated.</p>

<p>Nerathi sages knew how to predict mooncalf incursions with great accuracy, but
the knowledge has been lost. All that’s left are the stories of past
incursions. Of how Hammerfast was once tormented by a single individual of
prodigious size and appetite, or how a hunter was accidentally saved from being
eaten by a manticore when a mooncalf appeared and ate the beast instead.</p>

<p>The most popular mooncalf vacation spot, however, is Thunderspire. The things
just love the permanent storm at its top, and descend from it to hunt in the
surrounding region.</p>

<p>These creatures are intelligent but alien. They can communicate via telepathy
but only those who know Deep Speech can even begin to understand their thought
patterns. What they can understand ends up being mostly about killing and
eating. They will definitely talk to each other and set up clever ambushes for
prey, however, using psychic powers to lure their victims into the reach of
their tentacles, or to conjure small localized storms.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Mooncalves are Large Aberrant Magical Beasts, with Resistance to Lightning and
Thunder 10. They also have Darkvision, so I guess they’re not eyeless after
all. Their ground speed is 6 and their flight speed is 8.</p>

<p>Their signature trait is <strong>Tentacle Snare</strong>, which lets them pull all grabbed
creatures with them when moving.</p>

<h3 id="mooncalf">Mooncalf</h3>

<p>The base model, who makes up those grasps of 2-5. It’s a Level 10 Controller
with 112 HP.</p>

<p>The mooncalf’s basic attack is a Reach 4 <strong>tentacle rake</strong>, and it can use
<strong>Tentacle Grab</strong> to do a little less damage and grab the victim. The monster
can have up to 2 grabbed victims, and can release a victim as a free
action. The escape DC is 18, and grabbed victims take 5 ongoing damage while the
grab lasts.</p>

<p>These tentacle attacks can’t target victims who are already grabbed. Instead,
the mooncalf can use <strong>Vile Bite</strong> on them, which deal physical damage and
prevent the target from spending healing surges for a turn.</p>

<p>The mooncalf’s psychic powers are both minor actions. <strong>Lure</strong> is a ranged
attack that targets Will and pulls the target up to 5 squares on a
hit. <strong>Stormwrack</strong> is an encounter power that creates a fireball-sized zone
which deals 10 lightning and thunder damage to anyone caught inside. It lasts a
turn but can be sustained with further minor actions.</p>

<h3 id="mooncalf-harvester">Mooncalf Harvester</h3>

<p>Rarely, a mooncalf will present a peculiar mutation that gives it teleportation
powers instead of weather control. Harvesters are Level 10 Skirmishers with 107
HP.</p>

<p>Their physical abilities are all identical to the base model, but instead of
Lure and Stormwrack they have <strong>Teleport</strong>, an encounter power that lets them
teleport 10 squares and take all grabbed victims with them.</p>

<h3 id="mooncalf-sire">Mooncalf Sire</h3>

<p>A mooncalf that managed to grow to a prodigious size and spawn progeny. It will
usually be found in the company of that progeny, a group of three or so standard
mooncalves.</p>

<p>Sires are Huge in size, and are Level 12 Elite Controllers with 262 HP. They
have the same physical attacks as a standard specimen: Tentacle Rake, Tentacle
Grab, and Vile Bite. The main different is that they are Reach 6 instead of 4,
and are generally more effective due to the beast’s higher level. The sire can
use <strong>Double Attack</strong> to perform any combination of two of these attacks with
one standard action.</p>

<p>Sires also have Lure, and their weather control abilities take the form of two
different encounter powers. <strong>Call Lightning</strong> is an attack that targets enemies
in a Close Blast 5, does lightning damage and slows for a turn. <strong>Fury of the
Storm</strong> is an interrupt that triggers when the sire is bloodied, and causes it
to project an aura (1) that deals 10 lightning and thunder damage to enemies
caught inside. This lasts for the rest of the encounter.</p>

<h3 id="mooncalf-rogue">Mooncalf Rogue</h3>

<p>Sometimes, a mooncalf is separated from its kin. These loners might team up with
other creatures capable of understanding them, such other aberrant monsters or
mortal spellcasters with strong connections to the Far Realm. These use standard
stat blocks. A rogue is something else.</p>

<p>Mooncalf rogues are outcasts among their kind and are adamant in their desire to
remain alone. They attack even other mooncalves who trespass upon their
territories. The isolation, or perhaps something they do to themselves, causes
them to grow far beyond the size of a standard mooncalf, and to develop powers
not seen among those more gregarious individuals.</p>

<p>These creatures are also Huge in size, and are Level 15 Solo Soldiers with 620
HP. They have two additional traits: <strong>Psychic Veil</strong> makes them invisible to
creatures more than 6 squares away from it, and <strong>Superior Brain</strong> ends any
dazing or stunning effects on them at the start of their turn.</p>

<p>Their Tentacle Rake is upgraded to a <strong>Tentacle Slam</strong> that also knocks prone on
a hit. The other two attacks are the same, with bigger damage and Reach 6
instead of 4. <strong>Multiattack</strong> lets the rogue perform three melee attacks against
different targets with the same action.</p>

<p>They can call up a <strong>Windwrack</strong> aura as a minor action (recharge 5+). This
lasts a turn, prevents any creatures inside from shifting, and knocks them prone
if they end their turns inside. If an enemy escapes the rogue’s grab, it can
react with a <strong>Tentacle Flurry</strong> that lets it attack every enemy in a Close
Burst 1.</p>

<p>If you can see this thing at all, it can reach you with its tentacles. I guess
they would typically try to grab a couple of PCs and fly away to eat in peace,
but it’s also excellent at playing a more traditional soldier role and
protecting squishy artillery from PCs.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Delightfully weird and horrific, and an excellent out-of-context problem to
throw at the PCs when they’re busy dealing with something else. They go
somewhere to face a more mundane threat, and suddenly discover it’s mooncalf
season.</p>

<p>Rogues work very well as the Thing From Beyond that a Far Realm cult might be
trying to summon. They’re threats on par with an adult dragon or a titan, but
are completely impervious to negotiation.</p>

<p>Another faction pulled from the <em>Thunderspire Labyrinth</em> module.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Thunderspire Mountain is a famous landmark in the Vale, a lone mountain whose
peak is shrouded by a permanent storm. In the Vale’s distant past, a minotaur
civilization build an underground city beneath it, and named that city Saruun
Khel. They thrived there until the worship of Torog began spreading among its
inhabitants.</p>

<p>This angered their official patron, the demon lord Baphomet, who cast a curse
over the whole city that made his worshipers enter a homicidal berserker
rage. Saruun Khel fell in short order as its inhabitants tore each other apart.</p>

<p>About twenty years ago, the ruins of the city were discovered by three mages who
were interested in finding a reliable route to the Underdark. They found it
there and moved in, establishing their headquarters inside a building known as
the Tower of Saruun.</p>

<p>The mages were as interested in trade and diplomacy with the Underdark as they
were in its mystical secrets, so they turned Saruun Khel’s city square into a
trading post known as the Seven-Pillared Hall. The hall is open to trade
delegations and enclaves from both the surface and the Underdark, and is one of
the few places in the world where civilizations from both of these realms have
regular peaceful contact.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean the place isn’t dangerous, however. Big stuff like theft and
murder is forbidden, and the mages enforce that very vigorously, but there are
few other hard-and-fast rules. The mages take turns playing the role of
Ordinator Arcanis, a mage with a black cloak and a golden mask that teleports in
to solve any disputes or rule breaches that happen here. They use powerful
divination and scrying magic to quickly get to the truth of the matter, and
usually blast the offending party into atoms, or sic one of Saruun Khel’s
ancient minotaur-shaped bronze constructs on them.</p>

<p>The three original founders eventually brought in colleagues and apprentices to
join their order. Then they disappeared into the Tower of Saruun and were never
seen again. The cycle has repeated itself a few times since then, so the current
crop of Mages is a few generations removed from those founders. No one knows
what happened to those disappeared mages, and the mages themselves ain’t
telling. Some claim there have only ever been three mages who keep disguising
themselves as new people, others talk about a mage civil war that happened in
the Tower, and some who have journeyed from the deep Underdark whisper of
surface mortals who have gone down there and learned the forbidden secrets of
the primordials and the deep gods.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The Mages of Saruun contained in this entry are at an early to mid Paragon power
level, significantly stronger than the ones from Thunderspire Labyrinth. If I
remember correctly, the ones you see in the adventure are all low-ranking
members who are the only ones available while the more senior mages are
out. These would be those senior mages.</p>

<h3 id="saruun-apprentice">Saruun Apprentice</h3>

<p>Apprentices are fairly weak, so I’m guessing they only fight in self defense and
are not directly involved with keeping the peace in the Seven-Pillared
Hall. They’re Level 8 Minion Controllers.</p>

<p>Apprentices know how to use a <strong>dagger</strong>, and they can cast an at-will <strong>Ice
Patch</strong> spell that knocks the target prone on a hit. The spell only does damage
on a critical hit, in which case it also immobilizes the target for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="saruun-bat">Saruun Bat</h3>

<p>The aggressive bats that make this cave system their home are often used as
familiars by the Mages. These Tiny Natural Beasts are Level 10 Minion
Skirmishers with a ground speed of 2 and a flight speed of 6 (hover).</p>

<p>Saruun Bats can <strong>See the Unseen</strong>, which act as an aura (1) that prevents
enemies inside from benefiting from any concealment. They lack a basic attack,
but can make at-will <strong>Shrieking Dives</strong> that let them fly their speed and make
an attack at any point along the movement. On a hit, this deals thunder damage
and inflicts a -2 to-hit penalty for a turn.</p>

<p>If an enemy damages an ally of the bat that’s in the same space or adjacent, the
bat can use its <strong>Shielding Familiar</strong> encounter power as an interrupt. It makes
the ally take only half damage, and drops the bat to 0 HP.</p>

<h3 id="mage-of-saruun">Mage of Saruun</h3>

<p>This is a fully trained Mage of Saruun, likely one of those who currently run
things in the Seven-Pillared Hall. They’re a Level 12 Controller with 116
HP. Their basic attack is a <strong>quarterstaff</strong> blow that deals physical damage on
a hit and slides 1 square as an effect. They can cast <strong>Empowered Magic
Missiles</strong> as basic ranged attacks, which hit automatically, deal a flat 10
force damage, and push 2 squares. They can also cast <strong>Noxious Shroud</strong> spells,
which attack a Close Blast 3, deal poison damage, and create a damaging zone
that lasts for a turn.</p>

<p>Their encounter spell is <strong>Cloying Flames</strong>, basically a fireball that also
immobilizes and deals ongoing fire damage. This deals half damage on a miss and
recharges when the mage is first bloodied.</p>

<p>The staff and magic missile attack are a little weak for the mage’s level, which
is compensated by the fact that they always either hit or do something
interesting. Still, you want to pair them with things that do more damage, such
as those described by our next entry.</p>

<h3 id="bronze-warder">Bronze Warder</h3>

<p>The famous construct guards of the Seven-Pillared Hall, originally build by the
extinct minotaur civilization and refurbished by the Mages of Saruun. At least
one of those accompanies every mage when they make a public appearance, and
they’re often employed as enforcers by the Ordinator Arcanis. They look like big
bronze minotaurs.</p>

<p>Warders are Large Natural Animates and Level 10 Elite Soldiers with 168 HP. They
have a ground speed of 5 and their <strong>Ponderous</strong> gait means they can’t shift,
but their <strong>Inexorable Movement</strong> allows them to enter the spaces of Medium or
Small enemies.</p>

<p>Warders fight with <strong>Greataxes</strong> that damage and mark for a turn on a hit, and
they can make <strong>Double Attacks</strong>. They can also <strong>Rampage</strong>, which lets them
move 3 squares and knock down any enemy whose space they move through.  At the
end of the movement they make an axe attack that’s about 50% stronger.</p>

<p>Warders are linked to rune-covered control amulets, and consider the bearer of
the amulet to be their master. When they’re within 2 squares of that master,
they can use an interrupt to take half the damage of any attack directed at the
master (who still takes the other half).</p>

<h3 id="saruun-underdark-adept">Saruun Underdark Adept</h3>

<p>A mage who focuses more on those forbidden Underdark secrets than on traditional
arcane magic. This is dangerous and a bit unhealthy. Adepts are Level 10
Artillery with  79 HP.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Shadow Whip</strong> that deals light physical damage
on a hit and slides 1 square as an effect. They can cast <strong>Darkfire Bolts</strong> that
do fire and necrotic damage. Unlike magic missiles, these require an attack roll
but crit on a roll of 18-20, weakening the target when they do so (save
ends). Their big spell is a <strong>Corrupting Ray</strong> that deals heavy necrotic damage
and blinds (save ends). It does half damage on a miss and recharges when the
adept is first bloodied.</p>

<p>They can also cast <strong>Force Shield</strong> as a minor action, becoming immune to ranged
and area attacks for a turn. This recharges when they take damage from one of
those attacks.</p>

<h3 id="warped-mage-of-saruun">Warped Mage of Saruun</h3>

<p>A mage who dug too greedily, and too deep. The order sees this as a fail state
and is usually careful to avoid such a fate. When it does happen, they try to
deal with the result, which might involve discreetly asking for outside
help. Warped mages are Medium Aberrant Humanoids and Level 14 Elite Brutes with
346 HP.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 3 <strong>Shadow Tentacle</strong> that deals physical damage
and grabs on a hit (escape DC 21). When a creature fails to escape the grab it
takes 10 damage.</p>

<p>They can also use at-will <strong>Tentacle Lashes</strong> to attack enemies in a Close Blast
3, damaging and knocking them prone on a hit. Once per encounter they can use a
<strong>Psychic Burst</strong> to attack enemies in a Close Burst 2, dealing psychic damage
and dazing on a hit (save ends). A good power for when they’re surrounded.</p>

<p>When a warped mage is stunned or defeated, they undergo a process of <strong>Arcane
Release</strong>. The energies attack a Close Burst 2 deal damage with <em>four</em> types:
cold, fire, lightning and thunder. They also deal half damage on a miss.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the mages’ damage on their at-wills is a bit on the low
side, so they really need some beefy bodyguards.</p>

<p>Thunderspire Labyrinth has plenty of details about stories that can happen in
the Seven-Pillared Hall and the subterranean complexes that link to it. The
Blackfang gnolls feature prominently there as well. The mages from this entry
would probably be a distant and vaguely threatening presence until the PCs reach
their power level.</p>

<p>And of course, things would get mighty interesting around the Hall if the Hunter
Spiders ever learned that it leads to a reliable route into the Underdark.</p>

<p>This is another Vale-specific faction, one with strong ties to a published
adventure.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-iron-circle-tar-devil.png"/>

<p>The Iron Circle is a large band of evil mercenaries whose main base operation
lies south of the Nentir Vale in the city of Sarthel. They’re led by a man named
Lord Vhennyk and are faithful worshipers of Asmodeus. As an organization their
ultimate goal is to conquer the world in the name of Hell. Given what we’ve read
about devils and Hell in past projects, that likely makes them the militarized
faction in the Vale most deserving of the label “fascist”.</p>

<p>Vhennyk wishes to conquer the Vale as part of his overall world domination goal,
and has begun sending his forces to the barony of Harkenwold, near the Vale’s
southern border, likely because he believes it to be especially vulnerable.</p>

<p>Vhennyk himself remains far away in Sarthel. He’s delegating this invasion to
Nazin Redthorn, one of his captains. Redthorn is recently arrived at the Vale
and has been tasked with stepping up operations and upgrading the espionage
campaign the Circle has on Harkenwold into an overt invasion. Val Esed is the
spymaster in charge of the current efforts, and she’s been feeding information
on the Vale’s inhabitants and defenses to the Circle for a while now.</p>

<p>The Iron Circle is the major antagonist in the <em>Reavers of Harkenwold</em> two-part
adventure that comes with the Dungeon Master’s Kit boxed set. The Kit was the
main GMing aid for the Essentials line, and was sold at the same time as
Threats. This book really wants you to get that box, so it avoids spoilers for
<em>Reavers</em> and recommends you to leave the named leaders out of any home-grown
adventures until you can buy and read it (cha-ching!).</p>

<p>The Iron Circle is shown here as it was shortly before the start of <em>Reavers</em>,
so they’re still mostly focused on spying and reconnaissance, moving discreetly
in small groups and avoiding openly showing their symbols. Soldiers openly
wearing their colors are known mostly as slightly creepy foreign
mercenaries. Their spying does not restrict itself to Harkenwold, but also
touches upon the elves of Harken forest (whether they belong to Harken’s Heart
or not) and on the Daggerburg Goblins.</p>

<p>The Circle’s spellcasters all use infernal magic, and have a particular affinity
for summoning Tar Devils. These creatures are so named because they constantly
secrete tar from their skins, and they love acting as guards and extra muscle
for Circle detachments. They usually wear little clothing and use exotic
weapons.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get stats here for all the types of unit that make up the Iron Circle’s
roster, but as mentioned before the book avoids statting up important named NPCs
that have roles in <em>Reavers</em>.</p>

<p>The majority of the Circle’s mortal agents are human, but sympathetic people
from other races are also accepted as members. You can use any other stat blocks
from the MMs (humans, elves, dwarves, other species) as members of the
circle. Circle members have no common traits, so you don’t need to do much
reskinning for them.</p>

<p>Tar Devils are Medium Immortal Humanoids with Fire Resistance 10 and Acid
Vulnerability 5. Maybe acid interacts badly with the tar?</p>

<h3 id="iron-circle-brigand">Iron Circle Brigand</h3>

<p>The most basic and numerous soldier of the Circle uses this stat block. As the
name implies, they’re definitely not above engaging in a little banditry. These
are Level 1 Soldiers with 28 HP. They’re well-equipped with scale armor, shield
mace, crossbow and a fancy black cloak with the Circle’s emblem (a circle made
of chains) embroidered on it.</p>

<p>The <strong>mace</strong> and <strong>crossbow</strong> provide the soldier with basic melee and ranged
attacks. They can also use the mace to <strong>Drive Back</strong> an enemy, dealing the same
damage as a basic attack, pushing the target 1 square, and shifting 1 square to
follow. Their <strong>Relentless Assault</strong> trait acts as an aura (1) that deals 3
damage to any enemy inside that makes an attack that doesn’t target the brigand.</p>

<p>Brigands probably like to gang up on defenders and melee strikers, since most of
those PCs’ attacks are single-target and will trigger Relentless Assault on all
the other brigands not targeted.</p>

<h3 id="iron-circle-dark-adept">Iron Circle Dark Adept</h3>

<p>This infernalist spellcaster is a Level 3 Controller with the Leader keyword and
46 HP. They fight in melee with a <strong>Dark Dagger</strong> that deals fire damage and
slides 3 squares on a hit. At range they can use an area attack named <strong>Dark
Tendrils</strong> that deals fire damage, slows, and makes targets grant combat
advantage for a turn. It’s not selective, so it can cause friendly fire
incidents.</p>

<p>The adept’s leaderly power is <strong>Dark Imperative</strong>, a minor action that recharges
when they’re first bloodied. It targets an ally and lets them slide that ally 3
squares. The ally gains 10 temporary HP, and while those last their attacks all
deal an extra 3 necrotic damage. Great to place skirmishers behind PC lines.</p>

<h3 id="tar-devil-harrier">Tar Devil Harrier</h3>

<p>These tar devils are Level 3 Artillery with 36 HP. They fight with a <strong>Kukri</strong>
up close but prefer to hang back and throw <strong>tar balls</strong> that deal fire damage,
slow and deal 2 ongoing damage (save ends both). If surrounded they can produce
a <strong>Fuming Cloud</strong> (encounter) that deals fire damage and creates a zone that
lasts the rest of the encounter. The zone provides concealment and deals 2 fire
damage to any creature ending their turn inside.</p>

<h3 id="tar-devil-brawler">Tar Devil Brawler</h3>

<p>This one likes to fight with using its secreted tar as a weapon. It’s a Level 3
Brute with 53 HP. Its <strong>Tar Splatter</strong> acts like an aura (1) that prevents
enemies who start their turns inside from shifting that turn. It attacks with
<strong>slams</strong> that deal fire damage, and with <strong>Tar Strikes</strong> (recharge 5+) that
deals heavy fire damage, immobilizes, and inflicts ongoing 5 fire damage (save
ends both).</p>

<h3 id="tar-devil-guard">Tar Devil Guard</h3>

<p>This Level 4 Soldier has 53 HP and wields a <strong>khopesh</strong> in combat. The <strong>hot
reek</strong> of its tar acts as an aura (1) that deals 2 fire damage to any enemy that
starts their turn inside, and also prevents them from shifting that turn. It can
also toss a <strong>tar net</strong> out to Range 5, targeting Reflex. A hit deals fire
damage, restrains (save ends), and lets the devil pull the target up to 4
squares to a square adjacent to it.</p>

<h3 id="iron-circle-spy">Iron Circle Spy</h3>

<p>Spies are among the most well-trained mortal agents of the Circle current in the
area. They wear no identifying marks, and pose as normal travelers or
inhabitants of Harkenwold’s many small communities. Spies are Level 4 Lurkers
with 44 HP. When pressed into a fight, they use <strong>short swords</strong> in melee and
blasts of <strong>infernal fire</strong> at range. Both are basic attacks.</p>

<p>Spies can cloak themselves in a <strong>Veil of Shadows</strong>, creating a zone that lasts
for a turn and blocks line of sight for everyone except for the spy. They can
also imbue their swords with flame for an <strong>Infernal Strike</strong>. This is twice as
strong as a basic strike and deals fire damage, half on a miss. Using one of
these two powers recharges the other, so there’s your lurker loop.</p>

<p>If an enemy uses a power that inflicts forced movement on the spy while it’s
inside the Veil of Shadows, the spy can use <strong>Diabolical Dodge</strong> to make a free
basic attack against that enemy and shift up to 2 squares to another square
inside the zone, all as an interrupt.</p>

<h3 id="iron-circle-commander">Iron Circle Commander</h3>

<p>This <em>might</em> apply to Nazin Redthorn, or it might be one of the officers under
his command. I haven’t read Reavers yet! Anyway, commanders are Level 5 Elite
Soldiers with the Leader tag and 126 HP. They wield <strong>flails</strong> with great
skill.</p>

<p>Aside from basic attacks, they can use a <strong>Devil’s Tactics</strong> at-will maneuver
that does the same damage, makes the target grant combat advantage for a turn on
a hit, and lets an enemy within 5 squares make a free basic attack against the
target as an effect. If an enemy leaves a square adjacent to the commander, it
can use <strong>Tripping Flail</strong> as an opportunity action to attack their Reflex and
knock them prone on a hit.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the commander can unleash a selective blast of <strong>Infernal
Flames</strong>, which deal fire damage and daze on a hit (save ends). Allies in the
blast gain 5 temporary HP.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>Unlike Dythan’s Legion or the Gray Company, which can take a while to become
active, the Iron Circle is poised to be an immediate threat to starting
characters and to the Vale, which is exactly what happens in Reavers of
Harkenwold.</p>

<p>If left unopposed, they might end up pressganging the Daggerburg Goblins (as
someone in the RPG.net thread mentioned shortly before I wrote this), and might
even link up with the Shadow Court over in Fallcrest to grab information about
the city before moving against it in force. The Shadow Court entry gave me the
impression the Circle wouldn’t have a use for the tiefling gang, but it turns
out they would neatly slot into each other’s plans.</p>

<p>It was pointed out to me that the Shadow Court could be seen as embodying
several unfortunate anti-semitic tropes. One way to avoid that would be to not
make them a spy ring working for the Iron Circle from the start, to have a
more diverse membership than just tieflings, and to completely remove all the
text about their recruiting practices.</p>

<p>Of the groups we saw so far, the druids of Harkens Heart would have cause to
oppose the Circle’s advances into their woods, but would have little ability or
desire to fight them outside. The Daggerburg goblins would of course resist
being pressed into service to them, and might either have a good shot at
succeeding, or might need PC help depending on your campaign goals.</p>

<p>The Gravelstokes might work for the Circle if the money is right, but if you
keep the level disparity they’ll most likely adopt a wait and see approach
before deigning to offer their services. PCs who can scrape together their
ruinous fees might turn things around and hire the assassin family to strike the
Iron Circle’s leadership instead!</p>

<p>The Hunter Spiders would ignore all of these surfacer conflicts unless they give
them more opportunities to grab slaves to aid in their search.</p>

<p>This is such a simple entry, but I really like it.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, many years ago, a powerful troll shaman bore two children,
twin boys. Like any mother, she wanted her children to grow up safe and
protected, so she cast a powerful ritual that bound their spirits together. From
that point on, they could only be killed while in close proximity to each other.</p>

<p>This ended up making the brothers Hurly and Burly even more unkillable than your
typical trolls, because they grew up to hate each other’s guts. Staying in close
proximity is the last thing they want to do!</p>

<p>Nowadays, they live in two caves five miles apart, both north of Winterhaven
near the foothills of the Cairngorm Peaks. One of them is close to the shores of
Lake Wintermist, the other is to the west. The book doesn’t say which brother
lives where, but as long as you remember your own decision it should be fine.</p>

<p>Hurly and Burly mostly keep to themselves, roaming the area around their
respective caves and hunting the local wildlife. Every once in a while, though,
one of them will end up encroaching on the other’s territory, and the two have a
bitter and violent fight that can last for days. The brothers tear each other to
pieces, but this does no lasting harm because they’re trolls. It does leave both
of them angry enough to begin taking their frustrations out on surrounding
settlements and passing travelers for a while, which is one possible reasons for
meddlesome PCs to get involved with the two.</p>

<p>Could one of the brothers move further away to end these altercations? Sure! But
neither of them will give “that rotten git” the satisfaction of backing down.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The brothers are so alike they share the same stat block! They’re both Level 9
Elite Brutes with 240 HP and Speed 8. As trolls, they’re Large Natural
Humanoids.</p>

<p>Their basic attack uses a troll-sized <strong>battleaxe</strong>, and they can use <strong>Cleave</strong>
to attack all enemies in a Close Burst 2 (that’s an area 2 squares on a
side). This does a bit less damage to each target and pushes them 1 square.</p>

<p>The trolls have <strong>Regeneration 10</strong>, which as usual shuts down for a turn if
they take fire or acid damage. Instead of Troll Healing, they have <strong>Bound By
Blood</strong>. As with troll healing, once they drop to 0 HP the brothers get back up
with 30 HP after a turn. To prevent this, they must be hit by an attack that
deals fire or acid damage <em>while within 5 squares of the other brother</em>. This
can be either the attack that drops them, or an extra attack made while they’re
down, as usual.</p>

<p>The brothers’ blessing is <em>not</em> general knowledge, but they of course know all
about it. PCs might discover it by studying the trolls and succeeding at a DC 21
Arcana or Nature check. This could be done through quiet observation, but it
will most likely happen after the first time one of them fails to die to the
usual troll countermeasures.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I really like the fairy-tale quality of the brothers’ story. Presumably, the
party will end up interacting with them when tasked to resolve their conflict in
a way that stops their periodic rampages.</p>

<p>This could be resolved with murder, of course, even though that’s the boring
solution. Regardless of the party’s level, they can never hope to defeat one of
the brothers if they meet him alone. He’ll just keep getting back up! The PCs
must discover the blessing and find a way to get them together, which could mean
provoking another fight between them. In that case the brothers will try their
best to stay further than 5 squares apart, so PC controllers have their work cut
out for them.</p>

<p>But why restrict ourselves to violence when there are many more fun ways to
handle this? If you spring the brothers on a party that’s way too weak to fight
them, the PCs must engage in trickery or diplomacy to convince the pair to move
further apart. Or maybe the actual enemy is some more powerful threat, and the
PCs must somehow enlist the brothers as hired muscle. And it has to be both of
them. So now the controllers will find themselves trying to <em>prevent</em> enemies
from forcing the trolls together.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This is a vale-specific group, but it includes at least one deep-cut reference
to early AD&amp;D.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Deep beneath the Nentir Vale, lies the infamous drow city of
Erelhei-Cinlu. Though forgotten by the people of the surface, it sends the
occasional raiding party there to meddle in its affairs and capture
slaves. The city was directly connected to the Vale by a tunnel that emerged in
the Ogrefist Hills, but this tunnel collapsed three years ago. And when it did,
it trapped one of those raiding parties on the surface.</p>

<p>This group, who calls themselves the Hunter Spiders, initially made camp in the
Ogrefist Hills to await rescue, but for some reason the houses of Erelhei-Cinlu
didn’t make any serious attempt to clear the blocked passage. This was
especially concerning for the group’s leader Ti’irtha, who was the daughter of
House Despana’s matron.</p>

<p>After a few months, and much thought, the group decided no rescue was coming and
moved east into Harken Forest. They knew the forest had seem many skirmishes
between elves, eladrin and drow in the past, and figured it might contain an
entrance to another part of the Underdark named Torog’s Highway. From there
they could journey home.</p>

<p>Ti’irtha asked for Lolth’s guidance and was directed to a bramble-choked region
of the forest north of King’s Road, known as Spiderhaunt Thicket. The place
turned out to contain many ancient elven and eladrin ruins, as well as large
populations of giant spiders and undead fey. The Hunter Spiders soon put to work
the many captives they had acquired in their raid searching for the Underdark
entrance that surely had to be here. They’ve been there ever since.</p>

<p>The drow themselves focus their efforts in maintaining and increasing the
numbers of their enslaved workforce. They mainly prey on the King’s Road to the
south of the Thicket, linking Fallcrest to Harkenwold. When movement there grows
too sparse, they prey on the Trade Road to the north, which links Fallcrest to
Thunderspire. It’s a less ideal hunting ground for them because there’s fierce
competition from the Raven Roost bandits. When pickings are slim on both roads,
they get a bit more desperate and prowl the outlying farms of Fallcrest, giving
rise to rumors of obsidian demons who snatch people from their beds.</p>

<p>Lolth’s guidance did not come without a price, of course. This is the goddess of
betrayals and of the cycle of abuse, as we discussed in previous Let’s
Reads. Shortly after the Hunter Spiders arrived on the Thicket, Ti’irtha and her
consort Vhaelor found a hidden shrine to Lolth while exploring the region
alone. Seeing that as the sign it was, Ti’irtha murdered Vhaelor and ofered his
blood to Lolth on the altar. For her devotion, she was “rewarded” with
transformation into a werespider.</p>

<p>As a band of elite raiders straight out of the original drow city-state, each of
the Hunter Spiders is an extremely powerful and skilled individual. But there
are only 24 of them left from the original party, and they have no way of
replenishing their numbers. They’re not interested in conquest or in surface
intrigue - their main goal is to return home. This makes them one of the rare
evil factions in D&amp;D that might be truly amenable to negotiation. If they party
can offer them a way of returning to the Underdark, they really will pack up and
leave, possibly even freeing their prisoners in the process if that’s part of
the asked price for the information. However, they’re all wise in the ways of
Lolth, which means that getting them to trust you is a challenge in itself (and
almost impossible if you <em>do</em> intend to betray them).</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The Hunter Spiders are all drow, which means they all have Darkvision and their
powers tend to be shadow and spider-themed. They’re placed at mid-Paragon tier,
so they’re heaviweights in the Vale power scale, but as mentioned above they are
few and have no way to bring in reinforcements. It should be possible for you to
come up with a breakdown of how many of the 24 drow left use each of the three
“generic” stat blocks below. And we also get stats for Ti’irtha.</p>

<h3 id="drow-darklasher">Drow Darklasher</h3>

<p>This is an assassin employing shadow-themed magic and a really sharp
dagger. It’s a Level 15 Lurker with 114 HP.</p>

<p>All of the darklasher’s attacks deal 2d10 extra damage against targets granting
combat advantage to it. The <strong>dagger</strong> does solid damage but has no other
riders. It can also attack at range using a <strong>Lashing Darkness</strong> spell, which
can only target a creature that can’t see the drow. This deals heavy force
damage and slides the target 1 square.</p>

<p>Instead of attacking the darklasher can use <strong>Shadow Levitation</strong> to shift 4
squares into the air and gain total concealment plus a fly speed of 4 (hover)
for a turn or until immediately after it attacks.</p>

<p>Another way it has to become unseen is its <strong>Cloud of Darkness</strong> encounter
power, a minor action that creates a zone of darkness in a Close Burst 1 around
the caster. The zone lasts until the end of the encounter, blocks line of sight
for everyone except the darklasher, and if any creature other than the
darklasher enters the cloud completely, it becomes blinded while inside. The
zone can be dismissed as a free action.</p>

<p>So it seems that Darklashers can behave kinda like artillery. Set up a cloud of
darkness and stay inside, using Lashing Darkness to hit people from afar and
either disrupt their maneuvers or pull them into the cloud for a stabbing
boosted by combat advantage. If forced out, use Shadow Levitation to fly away
and hide.</p>

<h3 id="drow-spider-totemist">Drow Spider Totemist</h3>

<p>Another drow spider-themed spellcaster to add to our ever expanding
collection. This one is a Level 16 Controller (Leader) with 154 HP. It projects
an aura named <strong>Dark Pact Mobility</strong> (5) which allows bloodied allies inside to
automatically succeed at saves against slowing or immobilizing effects.</p>

<p>The totemist has this name because their main weapon and implement is a handheld
spider totem. Their basic melee attack is a <strong>Totem Bite</strong> that deals light
physical damage and inflicts 10 ongoing poison damage (save ends). Their ranged
attack is a <strong>Venom Ray</strong> that targets Reflex, deals poison damage, and
immobilizes for a turn.</p>

<p>The totemist can also summon a <strong>Spider Swarm</strong> (recharge 5+), creating a zone
in a Close Burst 2 around themselves. Enemies grant combat advantage while
inside, and if they end their turns there they take 10 poison damage. The zone
lasts until the end of the encounter, or until the totemist casts the spell
again.</p>

<h3 id="drow-razorscourge">Drow Razorscourge</h3>

<p>A drow soldier armed with a razor scourge, showing us that drow end up sounding
edgy even when they try to come up with a practical descriptive name. They’re
Level 17 Soldiers with 163 HP.</p>

<p>The <strong>scourge</strong> has Reach 2 and marks for a turn on a hit. It can also be used
for an <strong>Ensnaring Lash</strong> that deals less damage but grabs on a hit (escape DC
23). While the grab lasts, the target takes 20 ongoing damage. The drow can
still make basic attacks while it has a victim grabbed, but the grab ends when
automatically when it uses Ensnaring Lash again.</p>

<p>If an enemy marked by the razorscourge and within melee reach of it deals damage
to one of its allies, the drow can react with a <strong>Retributive Flogging</strong> and
make a basic attack against the enemy.</p>

<p>And finally, razorscourges are the only stat block in this entry that have
access to the traditional drow <strong>Darkfire</strong> encounter power, a minor action
attack that deals no damage and exposes the target, making it grant CA and
nullifying its cover and concealment for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="tiirtha-drow-werespider">Ti’irtha, Drow Werespider</h3>

<p>Ti’irtha is a Level 17 Elite Skirmisher with 288 HP. She has ground and Spider
Climb speeds of 7, and Resist Poison 10. She follows a lot of the same rules for
“mammal” lycanthropes.</p>

<p>This means she has Regeneration 10 that shuts down for a turn when damaged by
silver, can change shape between a drow and a giant spider with a minor action,
and has sets of attacks specific to each form.</p>

<p>In human form, her basic attack is <strong>Dark Caress</strong>, a touch spell that deals
physical damage and inflicts Poison Vulnerability 5 (save ends). If the target
was granting her CA, that save is rolled at -5.</p>

<p>In spider form, her basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> that deals poison damage and
exposes the target to the Spider Queen’s Curse (see below). She can also shoot a
whole frigging’ <strong>Spiderweb</strong> in an instant, a minor action Area 1 Within 5
attack that restrains those it hits until they escape (DC 23). The area becomes
difficult terrain for the rest of the encounter. This recharges when she is
first bloodied.</p>

<p>As an Elite, Ti’irtha can make <strong>Double Attacks</strong>, and shift between attacks (1
square in drow form, 3 in spider form).</p>

<p>Ti’irtha has an incentive to shapeshift constantly in a fight, setting enemies
up with Dark Caress and knocking them down with Spider Bites. The Spiderweb is
an excellent opener since restrained enemies make the whole process much easier.</p>

<h3 id="spider-queens-curse">Spider Queen’s Curse</h3>

<p>This isn’a monster, but it’s a Level 17 Disease that’s more treacherous than
typical lycanthropy. It follows all the normal rules, but the effects are very
on-brand for Lolth. The Maintain DC for your Endurance rolls is 16 and the
Improve DC is 23.</p>

<p>If Ti’irtha or another werespider bites you, roll a save at the end of the
encounter. If you fail, you contract the Curse at stage 1. This makes you feel
really good! You gain +1 to Fort, Ref and Will, and makes you recover an extra
2d6 HP whenever you spend a healing surge. Yes, even when this expenditure is
from something like a cleric’s Healing Word.</p>

<p>If you progress to Stage 2, you feel even better! The defense bonus remains,
that recovery bonus increases to 3d6, and you get a -2 penalty to your Endurance
rolls. Someone else might find that concerning, but you don’t. I mean, it’s all
good things so far, right?</p>

<p>If you progress to stage 3, you immediately die and a swarm of monstrous spiders
bursts from your corpse.</p>

<p>By the time you’re fighting Ti’irtha or someone like her, you’ve had easy access
to Remove Affliction for about ten levels, so here’s a disease that tempts you
into letting it develop. You can spend all that money and those healing surges
now for a bit of safety, or you can ride the high a bit longer to benefit from
better defenses and healing. It’s okay, you can stop anytime you want.</p>
