<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Succubi are very traditional D&amp;D monster. Just like mariliths (the <em>other</em> sexy
fiend), they’ve been a part of the game since the start. Unlike mariliths,
sexiness is their main schtick. Here we can find them both in the Monster Manual
and in the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Now, the first thing anyone familiar with older editions will notice is that
there’s something very non-traditional about succubi in Fourth Edition. They’re
devils!</p>

<p>You see, from at least AD&amp;D 1st edition all the way to 3.5, succubi were
demons. I suspect this was mainly due to their Chaotic Evil alignment, since
they’ve always been beautiful and cunning manipulators with superlative skill in
seduction and other mind games. They’re still all those things in Fourth
Edition, which has approximately nothing to do with the demon idiom while being
a 100% culture fit for Hell. Making them devils makes a lot of sense from that
perspective. As devils, their alignment is Evil.</p>

<p>A succubus is all about the classic concept of infernal temptation, using their
guile and good looks to convince foolish mortals to sign away their souls and
perform evil deeds. They might also be sent to the world as emissaries to
important mortals, establishing channels of communication between these villains
and the lords of Hell.</p>

<p>There’s no Succubus Lore entry in the MM, possibly because of space concerns,
but there is one very interesting detail in their description: unlike in
previous editions there is absolutely no mention of a succubus’ natural form
being that of a beautiful woman with bat wings (even though the illustration
depicts one like that). Instead, the description says they take the form of
beautiful men and women to tempt mortals.</p>

<p>This means there’s no separate “incubus” monster, and opens up a lot of other
possibilities. Maybe all succubi are genderfluid! Maybe their real appearance is
the lumpy hunchbacked goblin-thing of medieval legend… or it could just be a
real pretty bat-winged humanoid of any gender (including “none”). I mean, they
are fallen angels, and angels are androgynous.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The MM and MV versions are quite similar, so we can discuss both of them
simultaneously. Succubi are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils,
shapechangers). The Shapechanger keyword applies to any monster who can change
their shape in some way. It’s mostly there for reference, since the actual rules
related to this will be in the monster’s stat block.</p>

<p>Succubi are Level 9 Controllers with 90 HP. They have ground and fly speeds of
6, and the usual devil traits of Darkvision and Fire Resistance 20.</p>

<p>A succubus can Change Shape as a minor action, altering its physical form to
that of any Medium humanoid until it decides to change again or drops to 0
HP. It can duplicate any specific individual that fits that category and whom it
has seen before. Noticing the deception requires passing a CD 30 Insight check
according to the MV.</p>

<p>Going by the difficulty table, that’s considered a Hard check for Level 15
characters, meaning a level 15 character with both high Wisdom and Insight
training but no further Insight min-maxing will pass this around 50% of the
time. Level-appropriate PCs will find it even harder to spot a succubus in
disguise unless they spend a lot of effort on that min-maxing.</p>

<p>The succubus’ basic melee attack is a Reach 1 Corrupting Touch which which does
untyped damage and is otherwise uninteresting. The real beauty is in its other
attacks. There’s a straight-up Dominate attack that targets Will at range 5, and
dominates for a turn on a hit. Dominated targets act under the direction of the
dominator, but also count as dazed.</p>

<p>Then there’s the infamous Charming Kiss, which is more insidious. It’s reach 1
and targets Will. A hit means the target can’t attack the succubus, and will
interpose itself between any melee or ranged attacks targeting the devil if the
two are adjacent to each other. This lasts until one of the succubus’ allies
attacks the target, or until the succubus is reduced to 0 HP. This effect can be
sustained <em>indefinitely</em> out of combat as long as the succubus can kiss the
target at least once every 24 hours. More on that under Final Impressions.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, there isn’t much difference between versions, and most of
them are in the Charming Kiss. The MM version has the effect described above as
a <em>secondary</em> attack, requiring an successful (non-damaging) attack against AC
before the attack against Will can be rolled. The MV version has the attack
against Will as the primary, which I like. It also specifies that the
interposing effect is an Imediate Interrupt, which IIRC limits it to once per
turn. I like this change less, because it sounds a bit less fun to the cruel GM
in me.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 9, 1 succubus, 2 snaketongue assassins (yuan-ti)
and 2 constrictor snakes. Zehir wasn’t mentioned by name under “gods who are
friends with Asmodeus”, but this is like the third snake-themed encounter in the
multi-entry, so I guess he’s included in that group.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>The succubus is the iconic “sexy monster”… in theory. My impression is that if
you want to turn even the most impulsive lecherous barbarian into a chaste
ascetic all you have to do is announce a succubus is somewhere nearby. And if
you want to turn that barbarian into a chaste ascetic <em>contract lawyer</em>, you
show them the description of Charming Kiss. They’re going to spend all their
time between turns looking for loopholes in there. It’s wonderful!</p>

<p>Let’s enumerate a few of them… A PC under the effect of Charming Kiss can’t
attack the succubus, but they are in no way compelled to attack the other
PCs and can still attack the succubus’ allies normally. They are compelled to
take attacks aimed at the succubus if the two are adjacent, but are <em>not</em>
compelled to stay adjacent to it.</p>

<p>I mean, clearly the intent is that the Kiss makes the target fall in love with
the succubus. They’d want to stay close to her and make impassioned pleas for
the party to spare her and so on. But I think few players would enjoy
roleplaying that to the detriment of the group, particularly in the middle of a
fight. So here you have our brave barbarian gloating that he’s far too clever to
be taken in by the succubus’ devilish wiles… when in truth the succubus has
succeeded in turning him into a chaste ascetic contract lawyer who keeps running
away from her.</p>

<p>The succubus can pursue by flying, and can keep trying to charm other
people. There’s no restriction on the number of charmed targets! And there’s
always Dominate for preventing the PCs from running away. Clearly, the best
succubus encounter isn’t the one described above, but a succubus surrounded by
innocent charmed victims who will do anything to protect their love.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I originally wrote this as a comment on <em>It Came From the Bookshelf</em>, but it
looks like Blogger’s comment system simply ate it. So I’m expanding it as a
response post instead.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, <em>It Came from the Bookshelf</em> is a blog by John Frazer,
who is using it to review every single book in his extensive RPG
collection. This includes a few GURPS books, and not too long ago he finished
making very insightful comments about pretty much the entire Transhuman Space
line.</p>

<p>And a few days ago he made a post about <a href="http://www.itcamefromthebookshelf.com/2019/11/gurps-illuminati-university.html">GURPS Illuminati University</a>! His
review is quite negative and I’d even say scathing. While I can see where he’s
coming from, I don’t think I’d go quite that far.</p>

<p>You know those times when a player tries to tell a story to their friends about
this absolutely hilarious thing that happened in the player’s campaign? And that
hilarious story ends up getting some polite chuckles at most, because it was
only funny if you were there when it happened.</p>

<p>I’m sure lots of us have been on both ends of this situation multiple times, and
know how it feels. And well, GURPS IOU is that hilarious story in book form.</p>

<p>If I remember its introduction correctly, there was this private BBS maintained
by some people at SJG and their friends, and they used to run a silly campaign
full of in-jokes and silly references to the Illuminati books and to lots of
other media they liked. And then they turned that campaign into a book and
published it. And that’s GURPS IOU: the story that’s only funny if you were
there, in book form.</p>

<p>I can totally see how someone would loathe this silly, in-jokey setting if they
were going into it right after reviewing every Transhuman Space book. I can
totally see how someone can read it and simply not find it funny, too.</p>

<p>It’s probably not something Steve Jackson Games would have published today, but
the mid-90’s were the golden age of cheaply-bound GURPS Third Edition books on
exceedingly specific settings and topics. There were hundreds of the things!
What’s one more? And their home game gets to be immortalized with an ISBN and
everything! Plus it has illustrations by their artist player! Who happens to be
Phil Foglio…</p>

<p>That “reference barrage” school of nerdy humor also seems to have been in vogue
back then, which helps. Teenagers from Outer Space was out around the same time,
for example, and was widely regarded as the state of the art in anime RPGs. It
was basically a bundle of very specific anime references wrapped around a tiny
handful of rules.</p>

<p>I read GURPS IOU very early in my “nerd career”, when I was really into that
sort of humor. I was just learning about this whole world of stuff and it felt
really awesome to get all the references (“Dr. What! I know what that is!”). And
when I finally moved to another city for college and actually met enough people
who also knew about those things, it felt awesome to tell these jokes to them
and have them understand the references too. I didn’t get all of the jokes, but
I got enough to spark those feelings above, and to add some of my own equally
horrible ones to the lot when I GMed.</p>

<p>Call it weirdness, call it bad taste, but I got at least a couple of sessions of
hilarious enjoyment out of this book. It holds a special nostalgic place in my
heart for that. Even though it’s only funny if you were there.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>The book says spined devils serve as “scouts and sentries” in the Hells, and
sometimes as “spies and messengers” to powerful figures. Everything else about
them suggests they are <em>terrible</em> at these jobs, because what they really love
is flying around in bands and tormenting anything that crosses their path with a
rain of flaming, poisonous spines.</p>

<p>Also known as spinagons, they’re frequently summoned both because their relative
weakness makes the process easy, and because they’ll do what the summoner says
as long as they’re given ample opportunity to fling spines at people.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Spinagons exist only in the Monster Manual. They’re Medium Immortal Humanoids
(devils), and Level 6 Skirmishers with 70 HP. Like most other devils, they have
darkvision and 20 fire resistance. Their ground speed is 5, and they’re nimble
fliers with speed 7 and the ability to hover.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a claw, and their <em>favorite</em> attack is the Rain of Spines
I keep mentioning. A spinagon can fling the spines covering its body at victims
by flexing real hard. These have Range 10 and target Reflex. They do a mix of
physical and fire damage on a hit, and trigger a secondary attack against
Fortitude that slows and does ongoing poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>The spines actually do the right amount of damage on average, though it’s
expressed a bit differently than you’d expect (1d10 physical + 1d6 fire + 5
ongoing poison). The fix here would be to remove the secondary attack against
Fortitude and have the ongoing damage and slow happen on any hit from the
spines. That would make these kinda scary for a level-appropriate party, since
getting hit with the spines makes it harder for someone to get away from future
shots.</p>

<p>The claws do need a handful more damage, but like all artillery monsters you’ll
only be using their melee basic attack if you mess up.</p>

<p>The sample encounter in the book is level 6: two spinagons and a trio of
lizardfolk composed of a mystic and two bruisers. A pretty effective formation,
and a clue to a diabolist cult growing in the depths of the swamp.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Spinagons feel a bit underwhelming as a follow-up to pit fiends. Not only are
their stats really simple, their looks, disposition and attack forms would all
fit a <em>demon</em> better than a <em>devil</em>. They fight with natural weapons,
have animalistic traits, and like to kill people for the lulz.</p>

<p>Still, if you pair them with appropriate enemies that can capitalize on the slow
effect of their spines, they can make for memorable fights. The sample encounter
is a good example of this… and to make my point about these guys looking more
like demons, they also pair really well with evistros.</p>

<p>Pit fiends are the lords, barons, viziers and generals of the Nine Hells. In
other words, its upper management, just below the VPs (the archdevils) and the
CEO (Asmodeus). As such, they’re both on the Monster Manual and on the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Each of the archdevils commands no more than a dozen or so pit fiends, each of
whom fulfills an important role in the workings of that layer, commanding a
whole army of lesser devils. The impression I get is that the Lords of the Nine
are much more concerned with internecine political struggles than with actually
running the business, so most of those diabolical schemes the PCs find
themselves fighting are actually hatched by pit fiends and carried out by those
lesser devils under them.</p>

<p>Pit fiends don’t usually get involved in the schemes they manage. They only show
up in person when a big scheme is about to succeed… or when a band of plucky
adventurers is about to seriously mess it up. When they do show up, they bring
not only their own considerable power to bear, but also a number of backup plans
and dirty tricks. Your typical pit fiend has Int 22, making it much smarter than
its demonic counterpart, the Balor.</p>

<p>We’ll take a look at each version of the pit fiend separately, as there are some
significant differences between them. In both cases they’re Large Immortal
Humanoids (devils), and Level 26 Elite Soldiers (Leaders) with 486 HP.</p>

<h2 id="pit-fiend-monster-manual">Pit Fiend (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual pit fiend has darkvision, Fire Resistance 30, and Poison
Resistance 15. It fast as, well, a bat out of hell, running and flying at speed
12 (the latter with clumsy maneuverability). It can also teleport 10 squares at
will.</p>

<p>The fiend projects auras of fear and fire out to 5 squares. Both affect only
enemies caught inside, with the first inflicting a -2 penalty to all attacks and
the other doing 15 fire damage per turn.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 2 Flametouched Mace, which does both instant and
ongoing fire damage. If you add both up, then you get a figure that’s actually
appropriate for a monster of this level! The fiend can also attack with its
Reach 2 tail sting, which does a bit less physical damage and allows a secondary
attack against Fortitude for a bit more ongoing poison damage plus weakness
(save ends both). As an elite monster, the pit fiend can use a standard action
to attack both with the mace and with the tail sting at once.</p>

<p>Its “leaderly” ability is Tactical Teleport, which takes a standard action and
recharges on 4-6. This teleports two allies up to 10 squares away from the fiend
to any other square in that same radius. Instant flanking!</p>

<p>It has two minor actions. The first is the ability to create a Point of Terror
in someone’s mind, a Ranged 5 attack that targets Will and inflicts a -5 penalty
to all defenses for a turn. The second is the Irrestistible Command, which
targets a lower level devil within 10 squares, slides it 5 squares, and causes
it to explode and automatically deal some fire damage to everyone in a close
burst 2.</p>

<p>Oh, and remember how fiends of all kinds in previous editions had the ability to
summon others of their kind somewhat randomly? The MM pit fiend can still do
that with a 100% chance success, once per encounter. The fiend can call up
either 8 legion devil legionnaires, 2 war devils, or 4 legionnaires and 1 war
devil. These are always explicitly an add-on to whatever encounter group the pit
fiend is originally part of, and they’re <em>not</em> worth extra XP. While none of
these are as individually powerful as the fiend itself, War Devils are strong
enough to be concerning and the legionnaires make wonderful fodder for
Irresistible Command.</p>

<p>Pit fiends start any fight they engage in by summoning reinforcements, because
why wouldn’t they? They then use Tactical Teleport to set up some flanking
situations, soften targets up with Point of Terror, and then charge into the
fray to bash and sting fools to death.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 25: 1 Pit Fiend, 2 war devils, 2 astral stalkers,
and 1 marut concordant. This doesn’t include the pit fiend’s summoned
reinforcements! A harrowing boss battle for level a level 22 party, and the GM
gets to come up with a fun reason for the marut and abominations to be working
with devils. It’s not <em>implausible</em>, it just demands some backstory.</p>

<h2 id="pit-fiend-monster-vault">Pit Fiend (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The Monster Vault pit fiend has exactly the same resistances, senses, and
movement modes as the Monster Manual version. Its Aura of Fear is a bit
different, marking all targets caught within it instead of giving them a general
-2 penalty to attacks. The fire aura is the same.</p>

<p>The Flaming Mace attack is the first attack I see on a MV monster that has the
exact same damage as it did on the MM! Clearly ongoing damage is supposed to be
always be included in the average damage for the monster’s level. Makes sense,
as it will almost always get applied at least once.</p>

<p>The tail sting has been simplified into a single attack that targets Fortitude,
deals <em>25</em> ongoing poison damage and weakens (save ends both). The original only
dealt 15, which was typical for epic monsters. 25 ongoing poison denotes a
“blood of the Lernean Hydra” level of toxicity. The pit fiend remains able to
make both a mace and a stinger attack as a single standard action.</p>

<p>The damage from the Irresistible Command explosion has increased a bit, and
remains automatic. It also retains the use of Tactical Teleport, which remains
identical.</p>

<p>The other big change here is that the summoning ability is gone. This is
understandable, as it wreaks all sorts of havoc with 4e’s carefully tuned
encounter design rules. In its place is Nightmarish Punishment, which triggers
every time an enemy within 2 squares tries to shift or make an attack that
doesn’t target the pit fiend. The fiend gets to make what amounts to a free mace
attack against the target, only it slides them adjacent to the fiend instead of
dealing ongoing fire damage. No escape!</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I find it inevitable to compare pit fiends to balors, since both are technically
the strongest creatures in their respective factions that don’t get individual
names and backstories in the books.</p>

<p>If you look only at their individual stats, I think Balors feel scarier in
personal combat. They have more HP, variable resistance, and their direct
attacks do more damage. Still, pit fiends put up a respectable show in that
department, and are much more capable of acting as a force multiplier for
whatever other monsters are fighting with them. As with all devils, team
composition is vital to make a combat encounter seem dangerous and scary. Even
without the summoning ability, I’d encourage GMs to make pit fiend fights
include a very large number of opponents, and have some of those appear by being
summoned mid-fight.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>The devil entries in both books make frequent mention of the “Legions of Hell”,
and now we finally get to see who it is they’re talking about. They exist in
both the Monster Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The creatively named legion devils make up the bulk of those legions. They’re
kinda like the perfect ideal of the totalitarian soldier, as they don’t have
much in the way of personal initiative or even personality. They live to obey
their commanders, and will gladly give their lives if for the glory of Hell
ordered to do so.</p>

<p>If you keep following the corporate analogy I’ve been using you’d be tempted to
equate legion devils to the many salaried employees who fill cubicles and mail
rooms in any giant corporation, but the truth is they’re not very like those
people at all. They’re a lot closer to the dystopian notion of a “resource”:
numbers on a balance sheet, undiferentiated and replacable. Managers spend them
to achieve their quarterly goals and can always get more where those come
from. And they’ll never complain about any of this, because they’re happy to
serve the goals of President Asmodeus.</p>

<p>In fact, all this grim thinking reminds me of several discussions I’ve been
seeing on RPG.net lately where some people say humanoids like orcs and kobolds
aren’t acceptable “kill on sight” monsters, while others do a bit of contortion
to figure out a scenario where they would be because it’s traditional. Me, I say
that if you need an army of faceless minions who are never up to any good and
whom you should always fight with all your might, you should drop humanoids
entirely and look to these guys. Well, to all devils and demons, really, but
fighting devils-as-symbols-of-totalirarianism specifically feels a little more
satisfying to me these days.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Legion Devils are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils), and are always
minions. More specifically, they’re minion Soldiers even though the first
Monster Manual didn’t assign subtypes to minions.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual gives us Legion Devil Grunts, Hellguards, Veterans, and
Legionnaires, which are level 6, 11, 16 and 21 respectively. The Vault has
updated versions of the Hellguard and Veteran. All versions in the same book are
pretty much identical aside from level, and it’s pretty easy to level any one of
them up or down to the exact level you need if none of the ready-made ones is
appropriate.</p>

<p>Legion devils are armed with longswords and heavy shields, and wear plate. They
have darkvision and a fire resistance of 5 per tier (i.e, 5 at level 1-10, 10 at
11-20 and 15 at 21-30). They run with speed 6 (level 15-) or 7 (16+), and
teleport with speed 3 at all levels. They gain a +2 bonus to all their defenses
if adjacent to another legion devil.</p>

<p>Their longsword attacks suffer from the damage bug in the Monster Manual
versions. The Vault versions fix this, and also do aditional damage to targets
that willingly move in their next action. When building your own legion devils,
you should use this version of their basic attack.</p>

<p>This indicates to me that despite being expendable minions, legion devils fight
in a very coordinated fashion, teleporting short distances to gain combat
advantage and using their attacks to keep enemies locked in place and allow
their bosses to focus fire on the biggest threats.</p>

<p>The sample encounters in the MM are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 4 legion devil grunts, 2 tiefling heretics, 2 tiefling
darkblades. Your basic diabolist cult and its summoned muscle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 21: 8 legion devil legionnaires, 2 ice devils, and 1 war devil. An
infernal princeling and his personal security detail.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>There isn’t much <em>actual</em> flavor in the book entry for legion devils, but for
some reason they ended up sparking my imagination and giving rise to the rant
you see up there in the Lore section. In a game focused on fighting devils,
I’d definitely make regular versions of them for use as low-to-mid Heroic tier
opponents, and the minion versions would be a constant presence in the rest of
the campaign.</p>
