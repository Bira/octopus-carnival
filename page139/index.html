<p>Welcome to another installment on
my <a href="/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">GURPS X-COM: Noises in the Dark campaign report</a>! Today I’ll continue to
tell you about Operation BRUTAL ADVENT, our group’s inaugural mission. The
following PCs participated in it:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kendall Fairbarn</strong>: A paranoid hacker from the UK. Was completely convinced
human society had been heavily infiltrated by shape-changing aliens… and it
turned out he wasn’t entirely wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Minette Duvall</strong>: A bomb-disposal expert from Southern France, Minette is
also quite handy with a rifle. She’s devoutly Catholic and swears a lot when
faced with danger, which is all the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Niu Yulan (AKA Julia Yulan)</strong>: A former hostage negotiatior from China.
Julia is pretty handy with a rifle but her medical training and innate
kindness are equally important parts of her arsenal.</li>
  <li><strong>Jack Choi</strong>: A former police detective from Hong Kong, and a staunch
adherent of the “kick down the door” school of policing despite his light
frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following NPCs also had important roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Valenkov</strong> and <strong>Gutierrez</strong>: A pair of shooters from Russia and Argentina,
respectively, both members of the squad who lost their players just before the
start of the mission.</li>
  <li><strong>Yevgeny Korsakov</strong>: The pilot of the squad’s Skyranger transport.</li>
  <li><strong>Jan Wiest</strong>: A cop stuck in the anomaly zone. Together with his unit, he’s
been fighting the aliens for months.</li>
  <li><strong>Gisela Vahlen and company</strong>: Seven civilians inhabiting a building inside
the anomaly zone. Three of them are relatives of Dr. Vahlen, one of X-COM’s
top scientists.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="evacuation">Evacuation</h2>

<p>After arriving on the scene and <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/02/25/brutal-advent-part-1.html">investigating the anomaly’s effects</a> the
squad managed to pinpoint its source in the St. Marien Hospital. They decided
they will eventually have to get in there to stop all of this, but rescuing the
civilians should come first. Choi is a little disappointed that they can’t just
call in an airstrike and level the place.</p>

<p>Kendall manages to reach Korsakov, who tells them the Skyranger will be fully
refueled in an hour, but that he can leave ealier if they don’t need to fly a
long distance. Getting them heavier weapons would require flying all the way to
HQ and back, though, which would take a whole day. The local military doesn’t
want to share. The squad asks him to fly in ASAP in order to get the civilians
out.</p>

<p>Korsakov says he’ll be there in 30 minutes, and calls again after that exact
amount of time to request specific landing coordinates. He suggests the roof of
a building just behind the one everyone is in, in the middle of the block. It’s
lower than the surrounding structures, which should provide cover from snipers.</p>

<p>The PCs accept his suggestion, and having prepared to move out with the
civilians in the last half-hour, begin to do so immediately. Just before they
leave the apartment building, however, they get a worrying radio message from
the pilot: “I see a weird light nearby. I will investigate.”</p>

<h2 id="ambush">Ambush!</h2>

<p>This is worrying because Korsakov is never supposed to leave the cockpit during
an extraction, and he knows it. Before the party and the civilians have crossed
half the courtyard, they see him exit through the ground floor door of the
center building and head east at a brisk pace, flight helmet still on. In the
direction he’s walking there’s an eerie blue light shining through an open
second-floor window.</p>

<p>Choi and Kendall rush to the pilot’s side, and notice he’s obviously out of it,
as if hypnotized. He doesn’t stop to talk to them, but doesn’t resist when
physically stopped from walking. The others remain with the refugees, herding
them towards the Skyranger, but Vasily shouts out a warning when he notices that
the blue light is rapidly intensifying. In a second, a ball of fire shoots
towards Choi! He dodges it, and it leaves a small frost-rimmed crater in the
ground.</p>

<p>Minette pours suppressing fire into the window the shot came from, as Choi and
Kendall drop smoke grenades for cover. Julia and the NPCs stay by the civilians
as they run into the building. As the smoke grenades go off, a huge alien
<em>thing</em> jumps out from the window to the left of the one Minette was shooting
at, and disappears into the cloud. They only catch a brief glimpse, but it looks
like a giant seven-fingered hand.</p>

<p>Kendall takes Korsakov’s hand and books it back to the Skyranger. The pilot, now
recovered, is only too happy to run the rest of the way towards the safety of
his cockpit as Julia and the NPC soldiers finish loading the civilians into the
craft. Minette stands ready to shoot the alien if it gets close, but it’s hard
to see into the smoke from this distance.</p>

<p>Choi stays near the smoke, intent on fighting the alien. He fires blindly into
the cloud and hits it, but then the creature charges at him and pokes him in the
chest hard enough to break some ribs despite his body armor. He won’t survive
another hit like that!</p>

<p>Kendall runs back to the fray, followed by Valenkov and Gutierrez. The NPCs fire
burst at it and score a few hits, which do a lot less damage than
expected. The creature swipes at them with its fingers, but thankfully
misses. It hits Kendall with another energy blast, but the hacker’s ridiculous
armor loadout pays off, and he gets away with only a slight frost burn.</p>

<p>Valenkov manages to attract the alien’s attention for long enough to
allow Kendall to stick a greande wrapped in duct-tape on its skin. They get
clear, and the grenade finishes it off. This was their first official close
encounter, and it was only one alien. How many more are there?</p>

<p>They would soon find out. With the civilians clear of the danger zone, it was
time to plan the attack on the alien position at the hospital.</p>

<h2 id="spoilers-and-fight-analysis">Spoilers and Fight Analysis</h2>

<p>With the campaign already over, it’s safe to spoil you on the alien’s true
nature. It was a Bakegumo (“goblin-spider”), a creature that’s an integral part
of the ecosystem of the Dreams. They do indeed look like giant hands, though the
seven-fingered part was a personal addition: it both made them weirder and
referenced the “mystical” number seven, which I decided would be a recurring
motif in the alien forces. After this encounter, the PCs named it “Rosie” - I
never revealed any of the creature names in the Dreams of Ruin book, an
encouraged players to come up with their own.</p>

<p>The original stats for Bakegumo gave then five hit dice, so my version of them
is large and has exceptional ST and HP. It’s also Unliving, which explains why
bullets didn’t do much against it. It retains <em>all</em> of the original’s
supernatural abilities, so it’s a good thing no one was grappled by it. This one
was a scout, and approached the building in the half-hour between the call going
out and Korsakov arriving.</p>

<p>The party did an excellent job coming up with a plan to quickly evacuate the
civilians: the longer they waited, the more aliens would converge on their
position. Waiting the whole day for more ordinance would bring an overwhelming
attack force a few hours in. Using the grenade at the end was also inspired, and
worth the two uses of Gizmo it cost Kendall. Without that the fight would have
been a lot longer and more costly for the PCs.</p>

<p>They made some mistakes as well: smoke grenades were a total newbie trap in this
game, as the creatures of the Dreams see through a special psychic sense that
completely ignores things that impair normal sight. There was no way to know
this in the first mission, of course, but they would learn the aliens don’t rely
on normal sight if they had autopsied any of them in the strategic
interludes. Alas, this ended up not happening before the game ended.</p>

<p>This post belongs to a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to
<strong>GURPS</strong>. All other entries, and all other posts adapting the setting can be
found <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Gargoyles in Dragon’s Dogma are pretty much what you’d expect from hearing the
word: humanoid flying monsters with rock-hard skin and a love of clawing out the
eyes of unwary adventurers. The gargoyles of Gransys are living creatures, with
flesh and blood beneath that rock skin, so they add “hunting for food” to their
list of usual reasons for attacking PCs (territoriality, plain cruelty,
etc.). They also have an additional surprise in store: their tails are tipped by
a stinger capable of injecting a petrifying poison into a victim. They can’t eat
the resulting statue, but it’s still a good tactic for finishing off foes who
put up more of a fight than anticipated.</p>

<p>Gargoyles dislike sunlight, and so make their homes in ruins and cave complexes,
particularly those that feature one or more tall chambers full of good nesting
spots. Someone suddenly attacked by a gargoyle in one of these dark places might
confuse them with a harpy at first, only to be surprised at how little effect
their blows have on the creature. Somehow bypassing a gargoyle’s DR is vital to
effectively fighting it.</p>

<p>Welcome to another post in my X-COM: Noises in the Dark actual play report!
These are the PCs that participated in the mission:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kendall Fairbarn</strong>: A paranoid Hacker from the UK. Was completely convinced
human society had been heavily infiltrated by shape-changing aliens… and it
turned out he wasn’t entirely wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Minette Duvall</strong>: A bomb-disposal expert from Southern France, Minette is
also quite handy with a rifle. She’s devoutly Catholic and swears a lot when
faced with danger, which is all the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Niu Yulan (AKA Julia Yulan)</strong>: A former hostage negotiatior from China,
built without a template but approaching a shootier Face. Her innate kindness
and empathy came in handy in several of the missions! Julia was ran by three
different players during the lifetime of the campaign, which earns her a medal
for Most Helpful Backup Character.</li>
  <li><strong>Jack Choi</strong>: A former police detective from Hong Kong, and a staunch
adherent of the “kick down the door” school of policing despite his light
frame. Also built without a template. His player dropped out of the planet
near the end of the game, but not before making things <em>interesting</em> for the
rest of the group.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also part of the team were two NPCs: <strong>Valenkov</strong> from Russia and <strong>Gutierrez</strong>
from Argentina, both built using the Shooter archetype. They were originally
PCs, but their players quit <em>before</em> making even a single post and <em>after</em> I had
established they were members of the squad. I always found it funny that Strike
One never had a single PC Shooter who stayed on for a full mission. I mean, the
PCs can shoot, but none of them make it their primary focus.</p>

<h2 id="the-briefing">The Briefing</h2>

<p>As we saw in the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/02/18/x-com-setup.html">previous post</a> in this series, the newly formed X-COM spent
its first month of existence futilely scanning the planet for alien activity
before they found anything actionable. And it came not from their state of the
art spy satellite network, but from a Youtube video recorded by a 12 year old.</p>

<p>Her name was Gisela Vahlen, and she was Dr. Vahlen’s niece. The video was little
more than a standard “family letter” message, recorded on a laptop camera in
Gisela’s room, but anyone who watched could see that a lot was wrong with
it. The girl had the look of someone who had been living in a war zone for
months, and her room looked like part of said war zone. She struggled to
maintain a cheery tone, despite the evident stress she had been under, and spoke
in English instead of her native German.</p>

<p>Despite all the strangeness, a distressed Dr. Vahlen confirmed that it was
indeed her niece, and that was indeed her room, battle damage
notwithstanding. Pointing one of X-COM’s recon satellites at Cologne revealed an
anomaly of some sort covering Gisela’s neighborhood. It looked as if someone had
smudged the camera lens with a greasy finger. Infrared showed the same
thing. And no one else in the world seemed to have noticed it. There were no
news that anything was out of the ordinary in Cologne.</p>

<p>All of this was relayed to Strike One, our PC team, as part of the first
in-character post of the mission. Their goal was to fly to Cologne, ensure the
safety of the civilians in the area, put a stop to the anomaly, and gather
information on the aliens, in that order.</p>

<p>There were some questions, but Mr. Fox was the first to admit their intel was
crap on this op. The only things X-COM knew were the approximate area the
anomaly covered, and that things seemed to be terrible inside it and functioning
normally outside. At least it would be easy to evacuate from the zone.
Dr. Sokolov had already ordered his team to load the Skyranger up with
scientific gear, and all that was left before they were ready to leave was
gearing up.</p>

<h2 id="meet-the-quartermaster">Meet the Quartermaster</h2>

<p>At this point I introduced the party to another NPC: their quartermaster, Nobuo
Ishikawa. This little troll of a man was known as Kappa-san back in the JSDF,
but here everyone calls him Nobby. Because I firmly believe every military
organization in fiction needs a Nobby.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/nobby1.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our Nobby was more than happy to discuss gear selection with the PCs, and to
laugh at Kendall’s ridiculously large wish list that turned the hacker into a
one-man Ghost Hunters show crew. Most of this stuff was already in the
Skyranger, actually, since Sokolov shared his enthusiasm for unveiling alien
secrets.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the gear, I provided the players with a basic list of
weapons, armor and accessories to choose from. My goal with the weapon selection
was to make it similar to the initial list on the computer games, particularly
the 1994 original. The personal firearms were good for fighting people, but a
little on the anemic side when it came to damaging aliens. Then you had things
like grenade launchers and rockets, which were much more powerful but also
heavier and harder to use. No one took those, though they did pick a mix of frag
and smoke hand grenades. Julia also took a bunch of candy to win the kids over
once they arrived.</p>

<h2 id="insertion-and-investigation">Insertion and Investigation</h2>

<p>Once everyone had finished gearing up, it was time to board the Skyranger! It
looked and behaved pretty much like the one in the 2012 computer game, with a
top speed of Mach 1 and enough fuel to cross the Atlantic. It sacrificed
everything else you would expect from a military transport to achieve that,
being relatively tiny and completely unarmed. It was one of those quirky Russian
designs, and those adjectives also fit its pilot Yevgeny Korsakov quite well.</p>

<p>Even at Mach 1, reaching Germany took a while. Once there, Julia asked Korsakov
to do a flyby of the anomaly zone from a safe height. The passenger compartment
didn’t have any windows, but it did have a monitor wired to an external camera,
which showed the same “smudge” as the satellite image. Julia unbuckled and went
to the cockpit to look through the windows, and found that whatever was messing
with the sensors didn’t affect the Mk I Eyeball. The real landscape wasn’t any
prettier, though.</p>

<p>A region of three or so blocks around St. Marien Hospital in Cologne had been
turned into a veritable war zone. The commercial and residendial buildings in
that area had all been shot up and covered in weird graffiti, gutted car wrecks
littered the cracked and cratered streets… the place must have taken months to
reach such a state, and yet the city continued to function normally around it,
as if no one knew what was going on. St. Marien was the same hospital where all
those drugs had gone bad a while back, so whatever caused this must have
happened around then as well.</p>

<p>It was a good thing that the PCs asked Korsakov to be careful with the flyby,
for soon he spotted someone at the roof of the hospital pointing what looked
like an RPG at them! He manages to dodge the missile at the last minute, and
flies out of there.</p>

<p>The PCs discuss what do do next, and Minette came up with the following plan of
attack:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/brutal-advent-lz.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>
    The Area of Operations.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>They’d have Korsakov land about 100 meters to the left of the red X in the
picture above, on a wide avenue. Then they’d use the available cover to make it
into Gisela’s home, the apartment building marked by the yellow dot. Choi was
enthusiastic about kicking the door down, and Julia objected on the grouds that
they were there to rescue civilians, not antagonize them. Minette reasoned that
they might not have a choice, if the door wasn’t open.</p>

<p>The craft landed, and they made a run for it, cover to cover. Once more it was a
good thing that the PCs decided to be cautious about their advance, since a
sniper began taking shots at them from the hospital! Kendall threw a smoke
grenade to cover the advance, though it didn’t seem to do much. Choi emptied his
PDW in the sniper’s general direction while running, which seemed to have a
better effect. Fortunately, all the commotion seemed to have drawn the attention
of the building’s inhabitants, as a man opened the door for the PCs when they
got close enough, and they all scrambled in. Julia paused to take a last,
long-distance shot at the sniper, and apparently hit! No more shots came from
that direction after that.</p>

<p>The building still housed seven civilians: Gisela, her parents, and another
family with father, mother and two children. There was also a cop, Jan Wiest,
who together with Gisela’s father was the informal leader of the bunch. Minette
was proficient in German, and Gisela’s family was proficient in English, so they
managed to communicate acceptably.</p>

<p>Their situation was every bit as bleak and bizarre as it seemed in the
briefing. A few months ago, shortly after news broke out about the hospital’s
drugs all going bad, a large group of people in unmarked military uniforms and
eyeless gas masks appeared in the hospital building and began killing everyone
they came across. They haven’t really been trying to <em>occupy</em> the neighborhood -
they just stage raids out of the hospital, and drag any bodies back with them
when they return.</p>

<p>Wiest’s unit has been fighting them since nearly the beginning, and the
remaining civilians in the area have either been helping or hiding. A lot left
the area as soon as they could - all those that remain (cops and civilians) stay
out of a sense that they must contain the attackers. Wiest calls for backup
every day, but no one ever answered, and no one ever came, until today.</p>

<h2 id="assessment-and-planning">Assessment and Planning</h2>

<p>This story does nothing to answer the PC’s initial doubts: if this has been
going on for so long, how come no one noticed? Kendall uses his skills and
advanced gear to scan the airwaves, only to find them filled with something that
sounds a lot like wailing and gnashing of teeth run through a “creepypasta”
audio filter. It’s like an especially eerie form of jamming, as it prevents him
from reaching HQ or anything outside the anomaly zone. His attempts to get
through it end up revealing what seems to be alien radio chatter… which sounds
exactly like the jamming except for the fact that it also has the cadence of
someone with military training talking over radio. He also scans the laptop
Gisela used to send her video message, but finds it to be a normal Macbook Air
despite the occasional spooky image bleeding through its normal interface.</p>

<p>The squad gets together to discuss what they learned here. The detailed workings
of this anomaly are still a mystery, but it’s clear that it’s somehow preventing
information about what’s going on here from getting out, and it’s likely
affecting the minds of those within as well. The last bit would explain why any
civilians still say in there rather than simply making a run for it. Assuming
it’s being generated by some sort of transmission equipment, its shape indicates
that this equipment is located in the hospital and likely guarded by these
masked alien invaders. They’re going to have to get in there in order to stop
it.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>If you’ve been reading this blog for a while, you’ll know that I’ve already
converted no less than eleven Pathfinder Iconic characters to Dungeon Fantasy,
one for each of the templates from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 1:
Adventurers</strong>. You’ll also know that you can find a handy list of all of them
in <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">this page</a>, which declares that the project as a whole is done. So why
the heck are you seeing yet another of these articles here?</p>

<p>Well, the simplest reason is because I wanted to do another one. Consider this a
bonus track for the Pathfinder Iconics in Dungeon Fantasy album! As such, it
doesn’t quite follow the rules I set for myself in the main set of eleven
iconics.</p>

<p>You see, our subject today is Seoni the Sorceress. Here she is:</p>

</figure>

<p>I have to say this isn’t one of Wayne Reynolds’ best efforts, since the
proportions and the pose are a bit weird. That aside, Seoni stands out among the
Iconics in that she shows quite a bit of skin, tough at least her bio gives us a
reason for that. That bio is somewhat split between the page containing her
<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/seoni.html">d20 stats</a> and this <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la75?Meet-the-Iconics-Seoni">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>As the Iconic Sorcerer, Seoni represents a class that’s present in the
Pathfinder <em>and</em> d20 core rules, but absent from <strong>DF 1</strong>, which had the
Swashbuckler instead. It’s not hard to see why: any of the “traditional”
spellcasters from <strong>DF 1</strong> are already about as versatile as a d20 Sorcerer. It
would be a while until GURPS had an officially published template that had the
same relationship to the other spellcasters as their d20 counterparts. That
template turned out to be the aptly-named Sorcerer from <strong>Pyramid #3/82</strong>, which
in turn uses rules from <strong>GURPS Thaumathology: Sorcery</strong>.</p>

<p>So now that I’ve explained my reasoning, let’s look at what we can learn from
Seoni’s bio and stats.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>She comes from the land of Varisia, and belongs to the nomadic culture of its
original inhabitants. This culture is roughly analogous to the Romani of our
world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to her mystical bloodline, Seoni has experienced mysterious visions since
a very young age, and her quest to understand those has led to the awakening
of her powers. The tatoos covering most of her body are both a status symbol
in her culture and a focus for her magic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seoni’s obsession with being in control of her own fate combines with her
penchant for detailed plans to make her look like a “control freak” to her
companions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is <em>extremely</em> blasty. The vast majority of her abilities deal direct
damage, usually with fire or lightning. The rest are either straightforward
combat debuffs (<em>glitterdust</em>, <em>dispel magic</em>) or energy barriers (<em>mage
armor</em>, <em>shield</em>, <em>wall of force</em>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our version of Seoni certainly manages to uphold the “less known spells cast
more frequently” motto of the d20 Sorcerer. She knows all of four spells, but
she can cast all of them all day long without even spending FP as long as she
can both move and speak when she does so. She can only use one of them at a
time, but Accelerated Casting allows her to switch effects without pausing. She
can do passably well at social endeavors with her training in Diplomacy and her
Charisma, and can improvise any minor spell with a full cost of 7 points or
less, but what she’s really good at is spamming lightning bolts all day, every
day.</p>

<p>As for power-ups, she can always use more Sorcery spells! Her mundane skills are
lacking a bit, so any spare points there also help. Those players willing to
save points for a while can fully master Dispel Magic for an additional 48
points, which would enable Seoni to cast and maintain 2 effects at once.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/01/03/x-com-post-mortem.html">big post-mortem</a> on the Noises in the Dark campaign setting seems to
have been relatively well-received, and I’ve been in search of subjects to talk
about, so I’m going to make that campaign A Thing here in Octopus Carnival. I’ll
post a few more specific descriptions of my setup and play reports for the
actual field missions!</p>

<p>This will break up the blog’s so far relentless stream of fantasy posts with
some modern articles, and give me something to write about that’s easier to do
than coming up with stats for Dragon’s Dogma Bestiary monsters. After all,
everything that’s here already happened. I’m not sure I can post the GURPS stats
I made up for the Dreams of Ruin monsters or their environmental effects, but
pretty much everything else should be fair game. If you really want to see those
stats then <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/152691/The-Dreams-of-Ruin">throw some money in Mr. Grabowski’s direction</a> so the material
can be freed earlier!</p>

<p>In this post I’ll try to expand a bit on the basic setup for the X-COM side of
the campaign, since that part is all me.</p>

<h2 id="step-one-recruitment">Step One: Recruitment</h2>

<p>This was a forum-based game on RPG.net, so the first thing I did was to put up a
recruitment thread. I laid out the basic premise of the game: it’s GURPS X-COM,
with soldier PCs and occasional “strategic” interludes where the players
themselves made decisions for the organization. Prospective players should post
character concepts, and I would choose which ones would fill the group.</p>

<p>Recruitment was <em>not</em> on a first-come, first-served basis, as I had been burned
in the past by doing that and ending up with one or more severely disrupting
players. The lot I got from this round of recruitment was pretty nice, though!</p>

<p>Two of them would end up bailing out from the game before their first
in-character post, but I wasn’t too upset with that - it’s pretty much the cost
of doing business in forum games. I always recruit a number of players slightly
higher than what I think I can easily handle for this reason.</p>

<p>Obviously if you’re planning on replicating this campaign in a face to face
game, you wouldn’t have this issue.</p>

<h2 id="step-two-choose-your-destiny">Step Two: Choose Your Destiny</h2>

<p>Once the initial group of players had been locked down, I presented them with a
series of decisions that would shape the campaign to come.</p>

<h3 id="choose-your-enemy">Choose Your Enemy</h3>

<p>As stated in the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/01/03/x-com-post-mortem.html">post-mortem</a>, this was a choice between the original alien
enemies of the X-COM games, and the Dreams of Ruin. There isn’t much to say
about the former, as they weren’t chosen and I never developed them beyond this
initial concept.</p>

<p>Choosing the Dreams meant that the initial incidents X-COM was created to
investigate had more to do with traditional horror stories about fairies and
witches than they did with classic UFO mythology. Strange things silhouetted
against the moon, people vanishing into the woods, and a particularly notable
incident where all the medical drugs stored in a hospital in Cologne went bad at
once for no readily apparent reason.</p>

<h3 id="choose-your-leaders">Choose your Leaders</h3>

<p>In response to this, a group of 36 nations founded the Council and pooled their
resources to form X-COM. The idea behind the Council is nice: the nations of
Earth gather together to repel a global threat! The reality is a little darker,
as despite all delegates theoretically having the same amount of decision power,
the richer members contribute with more money and see themselves as entitled to
more influence. The ruling elites of each country also simply cannot resist
using this clandestine military and intelligence organization to handle private
issues that have little to do with aliens.</p>

<p>These negative tendencies are greatly amplified by having the Dreams of Ruin as
the Enemy, since one of their main effects is to amplify negative emotions in
their affected area. From the start I planned to have the corruption in the
Council nations to play an important role in the story.</p>

<p>There were fierce debates among the Council members over who would be its
commanding officer. Sure, they all wanted someone who could get the job done,
but they were also looking out for the interests of their specific
nations. Finally it came down to two choices:</p>

<p>The first was “Mr. Fox”, an American with a long list of shady black ops in his
curriculum, in places like the Middle East and the Balkans. He actually went
missing for years to get away from all that stuff, and they only managed to
bring him back because the fate of the world literally depended on it. He’s
pretty much a Big Boss expy. He has a reputation of taking good care of his men,
recruiting the best and giving them top of the line training. The downside is
that a lot of Council members don’t like him very much, and he has no time to
spare sucking up to them.</p>

<p>The second was “Mr. Smiley”, a well-connected member of the British intelligence
community. He brings from that line of business the idea that human assets are
expendable if it means the success of the mission. As such, his agents are
individually less well-trained than Fox’s would be, but there are more of
them. And his connections mean the Council loves him, in no small part because
he promises to look out for several of its member nations’ private interests. He
is, of course, a George Smiley expy.</p>

<p>In game terms, the players were given the chance to vote for one of the two
candidates. Choosing Fox meant the PCs would be built on 250 points, and would
get extensive drone and robot support once that became available in the tech
tree. It also meant that X-COM would eventually have a nasty falling out with
the Council, due to his inability to stay on good terms with them by playing
along with the corruption present there. As they would still be the only ones
with any real chance against the threat, they would be forced to go rogue.</p>

<p>Choosing Smiley meant that the PCs would be built on 150 points, and would be
part of a larger unit with several other NPCs. The opposition wouldn’t get any
weaker, which meant that unit would almost certainly face significant casualties
when it fought the aliens. Some of their missions wouldn’t involve aliens at
all, but would instead be about doing dirty jobs for one member nation or
another. This X-COM would be very well-funded, but less effective at combating
the Dreams. The “big falling out” here would ideally be between the PCs and the
organization.</p>

<p>Whatever commander they chose would lead X-COM, and the other would vanish from
the game… or so the players thought. The commander they <em>didn’t</em> choose would
go on to form a rogue organization that would make an appearance later. Yes,
this would be a version of EXALT from the 2012 computer game. Or rather,
X-ALT. The hyphens are important!</p>

<p>They chose Mr. Fox, which meant Mr. Smiley went into the cold to form his black
ops squad in the service of those corrupt special interests in the Council
nations. This makes X-ALT a “bad guy” faction.</p>

<h3 id="choose-your-science">Choose Your Science</h3>

<p>The players were similarly given three choices of Lead Scientist for X-COM:
Dr. Moira Vahlen, Dr. Raymond Shen, and Dr. Yuri Sokolov.</p>

<p>The first two were taken straight from the 2012 computer game. Here, Vahlen is a
German doctor and particularly skilled in the biological sciences. Shen is a
Chinese engineer and skilled in robotics. Sokolov, the original character, is a
Russian and also a doctor, but his main area of interest is paranormal
research - no one alive knows more about all those weird Soviet psychic research
programs than him.</p>

<p>Any of the three would be equally adept at leading X-COM’s research efforts, and
their different areas of expertise translated into different “free” starting
technologies as the new lead scientist used the organization’s resources to turn
their previous research into something useful in fighting aliens. Vahlen would
give them advanced medkits; Shen would give them flying scout drones.</p>

<p>They chose Sokolov, who was a bit of a special case. He spends that time
convincing his colleagues that he’s not a useless crackpot, so there’s no
bonus tech… but he turns out to be just perfect for leading research into
Alien Crazy, which in this case means <em>magic</em>.</p>

<p>Unlike the choice of commander, all three scientists are part of the team
regardless, along with a number of other nameless NPCs - this is just to decide
who calls the shots.</p>

<h2 id="step-three-hurry-up-and-wait">Step Three: Hurry Up and Wait</h2>

<p>With all the choices made, X-COM installed itself in its brand new underground
base in the remodeled Cheyenne Mountain complex, and began scanning the skies
for the alien menace… only to find nothing for a whole month. At the end of
that month something remarkable happened, but I’ll leave that for the next post
on this subject. Stay tuned!</p>
