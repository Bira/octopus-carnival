<p>This is another introductory chapter that goes into a little more detail about
the setting, but not too much more. It starts with a summary of the relevant
places in the region, then moves on to the obligatory super-long historical
timeline, and ends by offering campaign advice.</p>

<h2 id="neverwinter">Neverwinter</h2>

<p>Despite assuring the reader that no knowledge of the wider Forgotten Realms,
this section kind of assumes you’re familiar with the region already, probably
from reading the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting. Having played the
Neverwinter Nights games was enough for me, but as they’re very much In the Past
at this point I would have preferred if they assumed no prior knowledge and had
a more basic summary of the region. In the following paragraphs I try to
summarize it for people who wouldn’t necessarily have prior FR kwowledge.</p>

<p>Neverwinter is a coastal city-state located in a region referred to as “The
North”, with seems to be a typical Frozen North type of deal but with less
vikings. It’s built on the mouth of the Neverwinter River, which is warmed by
underground heat sources and thus never freezes. This makes the city’s port
viable year-round, and brings it great wealth from trade. A series of canny
lords invested this wealth to make a solid industrial base for the city and
strengthen its defenses. It became a beacon of prosperity and stability in a
dangerous region full of monsters and slumbering ancient threats.</p>

<p>The computer games end up being mostly about keeping it that way, but in this
book all of this is in the distant past. The Neverwinter in our book is a
destroyed city struggling to get back on its feet and threatened by foreign
interests and evil conspiracies alike.</p>

<p>The Forgotten Realms setting has a tradition of marking edition transitions with
world-shaking metaplot events, which usually try to give in-setting explanations
for why the rules changed. They tend to make lasting changes to the world’s
geography and pantheon, usually involving the death of the current goddess of
magic. The big change that heralded 4e was The Spellplague, which caused a bunch
of horrible mutations and a planar conjunction that brought in a whole continent
from a parallel dimension. That was a hundred years ago, and it actually didn’t
affect Neverwinter all that much.</p>

<p>What destroyed the city was the eruption of the nearby Mount Hotenow, about
thirty years ago. The eruption caused a river of pyroclastic magma to flow
through the city, killing half its population outright and leveling whole
districts. Over the next decades, the people who fled the city began to return,
along with new waves of opportunists who came to loot and decided to stay, and
together they’ve managed to start rebuilding.</p>

<p>There are still plenty of scars from the eruption, including a huge chasm torn
into the earth, but Neverwinter managed to rebuild enough that it drew the
attention of one Dagult Neverember. This guy is one of the Lords of Waterdeep, a
big metropolis to the south, and he has an expansionist streak a mile wide. He
arrived with a dubious lineage claim and a mercenary army, and then declared
himself the Lord Protector of Neverwinter, clearly intent on adding the city to
his personal domain. The people who live here are divided over whether that’s a
good or a bad thing, and it’s one of the main plots of the campaign.</p>

<h2 id="other-nearby-locations">Other Nearby Locations</h2>

<p>Several other places in the region should be familiar to Neverwinter Nights
players, though the combined damage from the Spellplague and the eruption means
they’re generally in a worse situation than they were back then.</p>

<p>Lots of smaller towns and cities have simply been emptied or abandoned.  Port
Llast became a ghost town after its port was ruined by the appearance of the
nearby continent of Abeir. The mages that ran Luskan were killed off by Drizzt
in some novel, and now the city is just the pirate-riddled cesspool it always
appeared to be. Other towns and locations that were important because they
facilitated regional trade were abandoned after the destruction of Neverwinter
halted that trade.</p>

<p>The mysterious Neverwinter Wood now contains both an eladrin city returned from
the Feywild (Sharandar), an ancient sky island crawling with remnants of its
original owners returned from the Shadowfell (Xinlenal), <em>and</em> an incomplete
necromantic fortress of unspeakable evil inhabited by people trying to complete
it (the Dread Ring). The Mere of Dead Men has grown bigger and more dangerous,
making it harder for supplies or help to arrive by land from the south.</p>

<p>There are legends of some ancient dwarven city named Gauntlgrym, but no one has
managed to find it yet. And then you have your standard stretches of hills and
mountains infested with ogres and dragons. The general thrust of this section is
that the Frozen North has gotten even more “frontier-ish” and dangerous than it
already was.</p>

<h2 id="regional-history">Regional History</h2>

<p>While Neverwinter is extremely focused on the region’s current situation, it
wouldn’t be a FR setting book if it didn’t include a historical timeline
stretching back tens of thousands of years. I’ll try to summarize this whole
thing and focus on the bits that are relevant to today’s adventurers.</p>

<p>In very ancient times this region was dominated by an <strong>elven empire</strong>
(Iliyanbruen), which after thousands of years of hegemony fell after fighting
back an enormous orcish invasion. Most of its inhabitants called it quits and
“traveled West” much like Tolkien’s elves do, but some of them fled into the
Feywild instead. These refugees built a city over there, and this is relevant
because that city has returned to the world and is the region’s main source of
eladrin characters.</p>

<p>During the time of the elven empire, you also had a <strong>dwarven empire</strong>
(Delzoun), which had several big underground cities in here. Its fabled capital
was Gauntlgrym, which started out as a big mine and got converted into a city
later. The empire collapsed after the big orcish invasion and the underground
mind flayer invasion that followed. This is relevant because it leaves a whole
bunch of lost dwarven ruins underground.</p>

<p>You also had a <strong>human empire</strong> (Netheril) that was ruled by archmages who loved
to show their power by building flying islands. This one fell quite suddenly due
to Metaplot Shenanigans elsewhere in the world, and one of their flying islands
crashed into the Neverwinter Wood. It’s still there! The survivors from this
empire are the ancestors of most of the present-day humans native to the
region. This includes the Uthgardt barbarians, but also other groups. Some of
these survivors settled the city of Illusk, which would become present-day
Luskan after being sacked and rebuilt a few dozen times. Neverwinter would be
founded much later by other descendants of Netheril who first settled islands to
the west and then sailed here.</p>

<p>The “Modern-day developments” section includes quite a few spoilers, so players
beware! I do find it cute that it made a point to mention the plot of the first
Neverwinter Nights as a significant historical event.</p>

<p>Anyway, after the Spellplague pulled the Realms into Fourth Edition, the
descendants of Netheril survivors who had fled to the Plane of Shadow came back
and started conspiring to take over the region by infiltrating Neverwinter’s
power structure. They got sidetracked when another conspiracy crashed into
theirs, but are still hanging around the ruins of that flying city.</p>

<p>That crashing conspiracy is a doozy, by the way: a bunch of evil wizards (the
Red Wizards of Thay) tried to build a necromantic fortress of ultimate evil in
the Neverwinter Wood and <em>caused the volcanic eruption</em> to destroy Neverwinter
and use the deaths to power the fortress. Their plan was foiled (probably in a
novel), so the fortress was never completed. It’s still there,
half-finished.</p>

<p>Gauntlgrym is lost but still inhabited, and over the last few centuries it
changed hands several times. The current owners are duergar. Its big secret is
that it houses a slumbering primordial (Maegera the Inferno), who in ancient
times was used as a geothermal power source by the dwarves and the mages of old
Illusk, who cooperated on the operation of the power plant.</p>

<h2 id="running-a-neverwinter-campaign">Running a Neverwinter Campaign</h2>

<p>This section describes how the book works as a tool for running a campaign. It
restates much of what was said in the introduction, and it does so in a way that
makes it clear it’s taking a different tack from your traditional FR supplement
or adventure.</p>

<p>As we already know, it focuses on the Neverwinter region; it also only includes
details that are useful sources of inspiration rather than trying to list the
names of every innkeeper in the city. The characters presented in the book are
active and won’t sit around waiting to respond to the PCs. The PCs, in turn,
will have access to character themes that will get them involved in the campaign
right away. The campaign is also open-ended - it doesn’t assume an end state
that the characters must work towards. PCs are free to set their own goals,
confident that their actions will have an actual impact on events.</p>

<p>There’s a text box here that should make critics of previous versions of the
setting quite happy: it’s titled “Killable Villains”. It says that while it
might make sense to stat up the main villains of the campaign as epic threats
due to the scope and reach of their machinations, this often results in the
players feeling like they can never truly defeat those villains until they are
themselves epic. Until then, they remain trapped in conflict with an endless
series of underlings.</p>

<p>For this reason, every opponent here, even the main villains was given stats
that are “within reach” of heroic tier adventurers. While some of those major
villains might make for tough boss fights for 10th-level characters, those
characters still have a chance of defeating them. Of course, GMs who want to
stretch their campaigns beyond the heroic tier are free to level those villains
up or use other appropriate stat blocks for them.</p>

<p>GM advice for running the campaign centers mostly around being flexible. There
are a lot of plot threads flying around, so it’s okay to remind players of where
things stand (from their PC’s point of view) if they get lost. It’s also okay to
<em>change the facts</em> of the campaign if your players end up coming to a “wrong”
conclusion during their investigations - particularly if their theories are more
fun than what’s written on the book! And finally, it’s okay to do what feels
right even if it contradicts what’s been written. Don’t sweat it if you forget
some detail and end up changing it in play.</p>

<p>Finally, the book really recommends that players make new characters for this
campaign, so that they can take advantage of the several themes available to
them. It does have some advice for bringing existing characters into the
campaign, but my feeling is that this is a very sub-optimal approach.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m not the biggest knower or enjoyer of the broader Forgotten Realms setting,
but I do have good memories from the games, so a lot of the places mentioned
here were familiar to me.</p>

<p>I loved the emphasis the book put, both in its introduction and here, on the
fact that your PCs will get the chance to do important and world-shaking things
on their own, and that even the top villains of the piece have no plot armor and
are defeatable. There’s a reason why I often refer to an excess of invincible
official NPCs as “The Elminster problem”, and I’m happy to know they’ll be
trying to avoid it here.</p>

<p>The material here does a lot to bring this region closer to the “points of
light” model prevalent in 4e, as a lot of what used to be safe places are just
<em>gone</em>, and there are a lot more dangerous ones. There’s quite a lot going on in
the Neverwinter Wood, and inside Neverwinter proper as well. I could have done
without that timeline section and its attempts at summarizing novels, but I
suspect we’ll see more details about the region’s present situation soon.</p>

<p>Before I started writing this post, I was convinced the <strong>Neverwinter Campaign
Setting</strong> was the last setting book for D&amp;D 4th Edition. Turns out there were
two more published in the following year, one for Undermountain and another for
Menzonberranzan.</p>

<p>I didn’t even remember these books existed, which I guess makes sense since they
seem to have a much narrower potential audience. Neverwinter, in contrast, is
probably the most famous place in the Forgotten Realms, and at the time of this
book’s release in 2011 it was even known to a lot of people who were outside of
the FR fan community.</p>

<p>That’s because by that point in time the city had already been the setting for
two successful computer games! Neverwinter Nights came out in 2002. It’s the
game that put Bioware on the map, and it didn’t take long for it to develop a
huge trove of fan-created modules and expansions, in addition to the official
ones it got in the years following its release. The sequel was developed by
Obsidian and came out in 2006, and though it was less open to fan additions it
kept getting expansions up to 2009.</p>

<p>And there was also the <em>third</em> big game featuring Neverwinter, the MMORPG of the
same name. It was developed concurrently with the book, something the book
itself makes a point of advertising in a side box in its introduction. I think
the book came out a little earlier than the game, because delays are a fact of
life in video game development, but they’re much more integrated than I thought
at first. The MMO is still active as of this writing, over a decade after its
launch.</p>

<p>Of course, the Neverwinter Campaign Setting is also perfectly capable of
standing on its own merits. It places a much greater emphasis on the “campaign”
part of “campaign setting”, which was a novel approach when it came out and
influenced the presentation of most 5e campaign books too.</p>

<h2 id="the-books-introduction">The Book’s Introduction</h2>

<p>The very first thing we see after the table of contents is an Introduction
chapter that explains its approach in a very concise manner. The book cover the
city of Neverwinter and its immediate surroundings, focusing on a small area of
a larger, already-published setting (Forgotten Realms). It’s not a static atlas
or travelogue - it’s a tool for running a campaign. It’s meant to be easy for a
GM to customize, and its player options help build PCs that are deeply involved
with several big plots that can make permanent changes to the setting.</p>

<p>The book is geared towards the Heroic tier (levels 1-10), so all threats and
challenges in the area are appropriate for characters of those levels. This
includes the main villains of the piece. Your PCs will not be stuck fighting the
grunts and flunkies of some epic-level villain. They will get to face legendary
threats on their own, without any overpowered NPCs around to bail them out or to
steal the scene.</p>

<p>I’m paraphrasing the book here, and I like that these assurances are right on
the first page. It’s an important thing to include when dealing with the
Forgotten Realms, which has been traditionally full of untouchable epic villains
and scene-stealing epic NPCs.</p>

<p>The also emphasizes that the situation presented in its pages is a starting
point - it’s a situation that will quickly begin changing as soon as the actual
game starts. The PCs are not only expected but <em>encouraged</em> to get in there and
meddle with things. There is plenty of intrigue going on and adventure hooks are
everywhere, but the story itself is not on rails. Just as the PCs are encouraged
to change things, the GM is encouraged to adapt to their actions and not try to
force a pre-determined outcome. This is a very nice sentiment! Let’s see if they
manage to uphold it.</p>

<p>Rules-wise, the book is going to make heavy use of character themes. Themes were
introduced in the Dark Sun Campaign Setting book as a new “thing” to complement
your class in the Heroic tier, just like paragon paths and epic destinies do
later. Dark Sun had several Athas-specific themes, and I think Dragon Magazine
introduced a few other more generic ones later. Neverwinter presents its own set
of themes, which are even more specific than Dark Sun’s - each of them ties into
one of the major plot threads they describe here, and some of them even make the
PC in question the “main character” of that thread.</p>

<p>As for required book, the core set is a given - that can either be the PHB+DMG
duo or the equivalent Essentials set of Rules Compendium and “Heroes of…”
books, though it’s going to place a bit more emphasis on the latter. In both
cases the Monster Vault is recommended over the Monster Manual, and the
Forgotten Realms books (Player’s Guide and Campaign Setting) are nice-to-haves
in order to flesh out the wider setting and give players a few more options.</p>

<p>Over the next few posts, we’ll be looking a the book chapter by chapter. Some
chapters my take up more than one post. This should take a lot less time than
the monster books did, but I hope you enjoy it just the same.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/04/19/gurps-fuzzy-turns.html">Fuzzy turns in GURPS Combat</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As you might know from reading here before, I hang out on the RPG.net forums a
lot. Whenever a discussion about GURPS starts there, some people often complain
they feel intimidated or annoyed by the 1-second combat turns.</p>

<p>Other games tend to have a less granular concept of turn duration and of what
exactly constitutes an action, so players used to them usually expect to be able
to do one “complete thing” in each turn without bothering with detailed setup
steps. For example, a ranged attack with a bow in D&amp;D takes a single action that
includes aiming, shooting, drawing a new arrow, and nocking it, all of which are
distinct steps in GURPS.</p>

<p>I actually like 1-second turns and will be keeping them in my games, but I
present here a possible way to make them fuzzier for those groups who don’t
enjoy them as much. This is a fairly fundamental change to the base GURPS
system, probably lends itself better to games that used simplified combat rules
instead of things like detailed hex maps and range measures.</p>

<p>This also helps combat feel a bit more like what you might see in action movies
or similar media, which tend to slow down things to make them easier to follow.</p>

<h2 id="fuzzy-combat-in-gurps">Fuzzy Combat in GURPS</h2>

<p>Under this rule, a combat round is no longer exactly 1 second long. Now it takes
an unspecified amount of time between 5 and 10 seconds long - enough for
everyone to act once.</p>

<p>Single-maneuver actions that can be resolved in a 1-second turn under the
original rules still take 1 turn to resolve here. This includes most melee and
ranged attacks, movement, and the Aim and Evaluate maneuvers. Advantages such as
Extra Attack and techniques like Rapid Strike work exactly as written, with the
same limitations, but read “seconds” as “turns”. The RoF stat retains its value
for all weapons that have it, but read it as “shots per turn” instead of “shots
per second”.</p>

<p>Actions that would take multiple consecutive maneuvers over several turns to
perform now take 1 turn per 10 seconds or fraction thereof they would originally
take. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Swapping magazines on a modern gun took 3 seconds, so now it takes 1 turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reloading a musket took 40 seconds, so it takes 4 turns now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any spell that would require less than 10 seconds to cast can be cast in a
single turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Searching through your pack for an item took 2d seconds. As the average of
that roll is less than 10, it only requires a turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Picking a lock takes a minute, which means 6 turns. Accepting a -5 penalty to
do it in 30 seconds means it takes 3 turns. This makes it possible to do
during a fight.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Fast-Draw skill now encompasses a series of actions taken to speed up a
given process. It can reduce the time an appropriate action takes by 1 turn, to
a minimum of 0. So you can still use it to draw a weapon and attack on the same
turn, or to reload a pistol and keep firing on the same turn. That musket is
still going to take 3 turns before it can fire again. You might want to make it
Average instead of Easy since a single roll covers a larger set of actions.</p>

<p>These changes make characters such as archers and wizards more powerful in
combat, since the number of things they can do over a given amount of turns has
increased, while melee-focused character can still take more or less the same
number of actions. Note that I have <em>not</em> tested how these changes interact
with the magic system, so I can’t measure how much of an impact it’s going to
have on spellcasters.</p>

<h2 id="things-we-avoided">Things we Avoided</h2>

<p>Note that we didn’t attempt to increase the effective number of actions by the
same multiplier as the turn duration. If a character could attack every second
under the standard rules, they don’t get to make 5-10 attacks in a single turn
here. Aiming or Evaluating for multiple seconds gave you extra bonuses, but you
don’t get them automatically here - you must perform those maneuvers for the
same number of turns. Our goal is to remove multi-step complex procedures, not
to keep counting seconds.</p>

<p>Yes, this is more abstract and perhaps less realistic, and that is the point. If
you want to keep tracking events second-by-second, stick with the standard
rules.</p>

            <p>The Wolf Runners were the last monster entry in the book, and after that there’s
only a glossary index. So we’re done with this book!</p>

<p>And not only that, we’re also done with my big project of reading all of the
main D&amp;D 4th monster books. I remember I started it January 1st 2019, with the
first posts going into an RPG.net thread and appearing here shortly
afterwards. So it took us a little over 4 years, 4 months, and 15 days to get it
all done.</p>

<p>Writing all of this was an interesting experience. The idea for the project came
at a time when I was having a bit of a hard time coming up with subjects for
posts to this blog, mainly because I was getting anxious about writing good
articles. I’d think of something, then I’d begin writing, and then I’d get
blocked or mired in an endless round of revisions.</p>

<p>Writting commentary on D&amp;D monsters, in contrast, felt extremely easy. I could
sit down, cover a bunch of entries, and have them ready for a regular release
schedule. Granted, I had a hard time sticking to any sort of schedule for most
of the project’s runtime, but I think I did a pretty good job of it in Threats.</p>

<p>Most people who read these entries here in the blog were probably 4e fans
instead of the usual GURPS crowd, unless they happened to follow my RSS feed
directly or something like that. None of those posts had a GURPS tag, so they
didn’t appear in the aggregator I’m a member of.</p>

<p>I still want to have a ready source of posts for Octopus Carnival, and I also
really like the conversations I had in the RPG.net threads for the project, so
I’m going to begin a new Let’s Read. There’s voting going on in the <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/lets-read-threats-to-the-nentir-vale.904788/">RPG.net
thread</a> for Threats, with the following candidates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Neverwinter Campaign Setting</strong> for 4e. I have it, and I have opinions about
it, so it’s a good subject.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hell’s Rebels</strong> for Pathfinder, with commentary about converting it to other
systems. Extremely convenient because I’ve already written a lot about it in
this blog. Might also give me more incentive to actually finish the adventure
path too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong>: A large enough effort that I’d need to
give it serious thought. It would probably not be a page-by-page affair, but
it <em>definitely</em> merit the GURPS tag.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Check the thread linked above if you want to vote or comment on any of the
entries. Otherwise sit back and enjoy the knowledge that there will soon be a
new thing to occupy your usual Let’s Read slots.</p>

<p>The last entry in the book.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Looks like the Raven Roost bandits have some competition! The Wolf Runners are
another of the bandit gangs who prey on the Trade Road between Fallcrest and
Hammerfast. They have this name because their leader, Sylish Kreed, has somehow
gained the loyalty of a pack of grey and dire wolves, and has them aid the gang
when they attack caravans.</p>

<p>Kreed presents himself as the dashing rogue type, and tries to be civil and
good-humored when dealing with his victims. The gang vastly prefers to take its
victims’ valuables without a fight, and to leave them alive and free to go. This
both lessens the heat upon them and gives them the opportunity to rob the same
people again in the future.</p>

<p>The counter-balance to this, however, is that Kreed is a terribly sore loser. If
he ends up on the losing end of a battle, he’ll become sullen and obsessed with
taking revenge on whoever beat him. He doesn’t necessarily want to kill the
offender, but he won’t rest until he’s re-established his superiority.</p>

<p>This sort of alpha-asshole behavior and the wolves might have tipped you off to
the gang’s big secret: Kreed is a werewolf, having caught lycanthropy from a
bite a few years back. He can transform at will most of the time, but for three
days on every full moon he loses control, changes into a wolf, and goes off to
live with his pack until his rational mind returns. Kreed’s condition is not
public knowledge, though I guess his gang-mates know of it.</p>

<p>His main lieutenant certainly does: that’s Eveni Redblade, a tiefling whom he
rescued from the Dark Drake of the Moon Hills some time ago, and who as a result
is completely loyal to him. Speaking of loyalty, the wolves are also loyal to
Kreed personally, though they tolerate the gang and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Wolf Runner ambushes tend to consist of a troop of archers hidden in the woods
off to both sides of the road, while Kreed and his wolf pack block the path and
handle the intimidation plus melee fighting that proves necessary.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Other than the unusual nature of their leader and his “understanding” with those
wolves, the Wolf Runners are a typical bandit gang that uses typical bandit stat
blocks. The wolves are also typical, using standard stats for grey and dire
wolves from the Monster Vault.</p>

<p>In this section, we get stats for Kreed, Eveni, and the Runners’ archers.</p>

<h3 id="wolf-runner-swiftarrow">Wolf Runner Swiftarrow</h3>

<p>With the wolves acting as melee muscle, many of the Runners focus on archery
instead. Swiftarrows are Level 5 Artillery with 50 HP. They have decent melee
and ranged attacks with a <strong>short swords</strong> and a <strong>longbow</strong>, and their <strong>Close
Shot</strong> maneuver lets them make a free bow attack whenever an enemy moves
adjacent to them, without provoking attacks of opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="eveni-redblade">Eveni Redblade</h3>

<p>The tiefling lieutenant is a Level 5 Skirmisher with 60 HP. She’s always <strong>On
The Move</strong>, ending any slowing or immobilization effects on her at the start of
her turns. She also does extra damage against targets granting combat advantage
to her.</p>

<p>Eveni fights with a <strong>Longsword</strong> whose basic strikes let her shift 1 square
before or after the attack, and she can also use <strong>Dazing Strikes</strong> (recharge
6+) that as the name implies damage and daze for a turn. Rounding out her
arsenal is the default <strong>Infernal Wrath</strong> power tieflings get, which lets her do
a bit of automatic fire damage to someone who hits her once per encounter.</p>

<p>This is a standard mobile combatant package. Eveni works best with plenty of
people to set up flanks and other advantageous situations for her.</p>

<h3 id="sylish-kreed">Sylish Kreed</h3>

<p>The (wolf)man of the hour is a Level 6 Elite Skirmisher with 144 HP. He has all
the werewolf signature traits, starting with <strong>Regeneration</strong>, which as usual
shuts down for a turn if he takes damage from silvered weapons.</p>

<p>He can also <strong>Change Shape</strong> to assume human, wolf, or hybrid forms. In human or
hybrid form he can use a <strong>Greatsword</strong> that provides standard basic attacks. In
wolf or hybrid form, he can <strong>Claw</strong> and <strong>Bite</strong>. The claw does more damage to
bloodied targets and lets Kreed shift <em>4</em> squares on a hit. The bite knocks
targets prone and exposes them to werewolf moon frenzy as described in the
Monster Vault. The <strong>Bloodmoon Fury</strong> ability lets him either attack twice with
the sword or make a claw and a bite attack on the same action.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like the Wolf Runners a lot more than I like the lizardfolk, that’s for
sure. I also think it’s interesting that the Wolf Runners have a lot of other
factions to worry about even if the PCs never fight them directly.</p>

<p>If they really operate on the Trade Road, they’re in direct competition with the
Raven Roost gang and/or the Blackfang Gnolls, both of which are a lot more
murderous than themselves. If we instead move them to King’s Road, they’re going
to contend with the Iron Circle in Harkenwold and possibly with the Daggerburg
Goblins.</p>

<p>All of the Wolf Runners presented here are Unaligned, so you can easily play
them as rogues with hearts of gold and have them as possible allies against an
unjust lord or against some of the other factions, Robin Hood-style.</p>
