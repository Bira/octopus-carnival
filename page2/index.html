        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The Shadowfell Road ends in Thay.</p>

<p>This is where the book technically breaks its promises. While every other place
so far has been presented as somewhere the party could go, the text here sounds
almost scared when it talks about the Thayan heartland because that’s where
Szass Tam and all his epic-level wizard buddies live. It makes it very clear
that the PCs should not go there.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the bulk of this section is not actually talking about the massive
plateau that makes up the Thayan heartland, but about the peripheral areas
surrounding that plateau. Special attention is given to Surcross and Veil, a
pair of fortified towns at its base, as well as to the Netherese flying fortress
that’s currently besieging them.</p>

<p>Veil is where the Shadowfell Road ends. Surcross is a short distance away and is
where all of Valindra’s supplies come from. The main reason the PCs would want
to come here is to disrupt that supply network in order to defeat her back in
Neverwinter. Depending on how the GM sets things up, it’s also possible her soul
vessel is hidden somewhere in Surcross.</p>

<p>The area around these two cities is a horrifying wasteland of destroyed nature
and abandoned villages whose ground is coated in bits of bone and flesh that
were too broken up to animate. We’ll take a look at the general area here, and
then zoom into the cities and fortress in future posts.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-thay">Overview of Thay</h2>

<p>In editions past, Thay used to be a slave-holding nation of evil wizards whose
schtick was over-specializing in one of D&amp;D’s schools of magic. Their ideology
was very similar to fascism with wizards at the top of the heap, but they tried
to present a more “friendly” face to the outside world, setting up trade
enclaves while keeping their dastardly schemes secret.</p>

<p>I believe the lich Szass Tam used to be a member of Thay’s ruling council, but
now he’s taken over completely and became its supreme leader. He turned Thay
into a “nation of undeath”, equally devoted to necromancy and conquest. Why
pretend to be friendly to other nations when you can just invade them and take
their stuff? The only deity whose worship Tam permits is Bane, the evil god of
conquest, and he’s suspicious of even that. Yes, worship of Vecna is completely
forbidden - I think Tam sees him as the competition.</p>

<p>Thay remains in this state when we switch to 5th Edition, by the way - it’s one
of the things they didn’t change back.</p>

<p>Climbing to the top of the Thayan plateau is discouraged not only by the book’s
scared tone, but by the many defenses placed around it. Its walls are almost
vertical and the only ways up are a set of narrow switchbacks that leave
characters exposed to artillery fire from both sides of the ongoing war.</p>

<p>Both Surcross and the Netherese fortress of Kolthunral have amazingly powerful
weapons and defenses at their disposal. Kolthunral’s mission is to cut
Valindra’s supply line by destroying Surcross and/or Veil, which is why it
hasn’t moved away. The PCs arrive to find them locked in a prolonged siege, as
neither is able to fully overcome the others’ defenses.</p>

<p>A significant portion of Thay’s forces are composed of undead, both at the grunt
and officer levels. Their living soldiers are mostly humans, orcs, and gnolls,
with plenty of spellcasters.</p>

<p>A character like the Renegade Red Wizard could be very helpful here if they
still have friends in the region, but they’re also coming back to the lion’s den
and if the Thayans realize the renegade is here they will be relentless in their
pursuit.</p>

<p>In addition to any friends of the Red Wizard PC that might be here, the area
also contains a bunch of spies and infiltrators sent by Dempharis Sibront, an
elderly Red Wizard who escaped Tam’s conquest of the nation. Sibront considers
himself nobility in exile and his network of infiltrated rebels is looking for
any way to weaken’s Tam’s hold on the country. The PCs can form an alliance of
convenience with him to fulfill their own goals, since they align, and his
forces will be genuinely helpful in that situation.</p>

<p>However he is likely to interpret this situation as the PCs agreeing to serve
him indefinitely, and could become an enemy in future adventures when he
realizes that wasn’t the case. That seems like an interesting opportunity for
continuing the campaign past the material in the book.</p>

<h2 id="the-charnel-fields">The Charnel Fields</h2>

<p>The horrifying plains of death in the area surrounding the two Thayan towns are
a product not just of the war, but also of Thayan fuckery. Since right after the
first battles, the Thayans started hauling corpses from the battlefield for
animation. But since some of those battles happened far away, they decided to
enact a “little” ritual to make things more convenient, using the blood of the
fallen as a focus.</p>

<p>Any corpse left on or under the earth within a hundred miles of Surcross will be
sucked by the enchanted soil and transported to an area near the city, where it
will be extruded to the surface. This makes it easy for Thayan necromancers to
haul them back for reanimation, and it also attracts all sorts of natural and
supernatural predators who want to feast on the remaining bits. The Netherese
have also started hauling corpses away from the charnel fields, to deny the “raw
material” to their enemies and maybe animate some of it themselves.</p>

<h3 id="relsforin">Relsforin</h3>

<p>The desperate inhabitants of this small village survived by making themselves
useful to Thay. They make up the bulk of the labor force that hauls corpses from
the Charnel Fields to Surcross, and in exchange receive some protection from
Netherese attacks. They fear the Netherese more than they resent the Thayans,
and if they think a group of strangers (such as the PCs) are likely to be
enemies of their masters, they will turn them in.</p>

<h3 id="echo-village">Echo Village</h3>

<p>This village belonged to the neighboring nation of Thesk until a short while
ago. The mercantile Theskans built it as a trade post near the Thayan border, to
facilitate commerce with the wizard nation.</p>

<p>Shortly after the war started the Thayans invaded the village and slaughtered
all of its inhabitants to turn them into more undead soldiers. They left the
village behind as an empty husk, but the angry ghosts of the inhabitants soon
appeared to haunt the place and wail about the hatred they felt for their
murderers. This attracted the spirits of <em>other</em> Thayan victims, turning Echo
Village into a sort of gathering point for ghosts with a grudge against Thay.</p>

<p>The ghosts’ default reaction to any living people approaching their village is
violence - they’ll attack while shouting rants against Thay. PC groups who are
perceptive and diplomatic enough might be able to figure things out from these
rants and convince the ghosts that they too are enemies of Thay.</p>

<p>This would ironically make Echo Village the safest refuge for the PCs in the
entire region, as the ghosts would allow them to stay while still attacking any
intruders. It’s an interesting contrast with Relsforin, which <em>seems</em> safe but
is not.</p>

<p>If the PCs then manage to lure the Thayan legion that contains the villagers’
original bodies back to Echo, the ghosts will be able to “repossess” their
bodies and turn against their commanders, potentially slaughtering the whole
legion. This will finally let them rest, and they will inform the PCs of any
sensitive information their bodies learned before moving on from the world.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Yikes! War crimes as far as the eye can see. It does put the events happening in
Neverwinter into context. GMs and players might be used to thinking of
heroic-tier campaigns as being “no big deal” in the grand scheme of things, but
everything that’s happening here in Thay is a B plot for the events in
Neverwinter.</p>

<p>We set our parameters in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/11/09/hackaton-sr5-1.html">last post</a>, so let’s do the actual run in this
one.</p>

<h2 id="run-summary">Run Summary</h2>

<p>Our decker enters with her team, and they get past the reception as usual. This
time I decide to do things a little bit differently and go for spoofing
peripheral devices over trying to control them from inside the host. This seems
to be the correct way to do it in SR5, judging from the examples in the Matrix
chapter. The Control Device action is only used for things that would require a
conventional skill test if done in the physical world, like shooting a turret’s
gun.</p>

<p>First, the camera. It’s visible both in the real and in the Matrix, since
running silent would harm its functionality. Ms. Decker always prefers to use
the “quiet” Hack on the Fly action, since that’s her specialty. The camera and
other devices are tied to the office’s host, so they use the host’s ratings
instead of their own to resist. But when Ms. Decker places a mark on a device,
she automatically places a mark on the host as well.</p>

<p>She manages to place a mark on the camera, and therefore on the host. This means
she can dispense with silent running from this point on, since the Patrol IC
can’t tell the mark she has right now was illegally obtained and will no longer
try to raise an alarm. She uses a Spoof action on the camera, disabling it. Our
tally sits at 6. We do not want it to reach 40.</p>

<p>Ms. Decker knows there is an alarm, but it’s not immediately visible as an icon
on the Matrix. Unlike the camera, the alarm <em>is</em> running silent. A Matrix
Perception action reveals that there is indeed a hidden icon nearby. A couple
more attempts at it reveal the alarm’s icon. None of these perception tests
accrues Overwatch, since they’re not tied to the “illegal” attributes.</p>

<p>She tries to mark the alarm, but fails! I spend 1 Edge to roll an additional 2
dice (her Edge score) on this, and get 2 extra hits. From what I understand, a
tie here isn’t a victory for either side, so ms. Decker still fails to mark the
alarm but the system does not detect her. Whew! The next attempt succeeds, but
both sides roll really well. The spoof attempt succeeds handily. Our tally sits
at 17 after all of that.</p>

<p>Ms. Decker disconnects from the host at this point since she needs to move with
the physical team. But since she does not reboot her deck, all of the marks she
placed remain on the host. Her Overwatch Tally also stays at 17.</p>

<p>The team enters the records room and begins the physical search. Ms. Decker
spots a physical jackpoint here and uses that. She’s inside the host again, and
now she is able to see all of its remaining files and devices automatically
since none of them are silent. This includes the evidence she’s after, which is
only accessible from this jackpoint.</p>

<p>Downloading a file is automatic, but it requires a mark on it first. She manages
to mark and download the evidence, and then decides to go for the money. I rule
that this will require marking the account file and then editing it to transfer
the money. The marking goes smoothly, the editing runs into a tied test first,
succeeding on the second attempt. Fortunately only the marking accrued
Overwatch, which at this point sits at 23.</p>

<p>Finally, still jacked into that physical access point, Ms. Decker attempts to
mark and spoof the exit door to unlock it. The marking succeeds, and the
spoofing gives me a bit of stress as again the first attempt ties and the second
one succeeds. Good rolls all around here, so our final Overwatch tally is a
dangerous 37.</p>

<p>Our hacker has time to safely jack out, and the team gets to walk away through
the now-unlocked door. All mission goals have been accomplished. She waits until
they’re out to reboot her deck, since that would erase all of her marks.</p>

<p>Total time: 31 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>31 minutes is something I consider fast, comparable to CP 2020 and CP RED. It’s
also about as easy to slice up into manageable chunks as CP RED’s and SR 4’s
runs were.</p>

<p>However this was a near-perfect run, with our decker remaining undetected
throughout the whole thing despite a couple of close calls. If we had been
detected at any point there would have been cybercombat and things would have
taken longer.</p>

<p>Unlike most of the other games we’ve looked at so far, it’s impossible to simply
kill all the ice, since each one a hacker destroys is just going to be
relaunched at the start of the next turn. The occasional assurances by the book
that you can rely on brute force alone to smash through a host ring a bit
hollow, since that seems like it leads to combat sooner even with good rolls
from the hacker.</p>

<p>Had she activated the host’s ice, Ms. Decker would need to spend actions to hide
instead of just attacking. That Patrol IC would be trying to find her every turn
and she’d take a universal -2 dice penalty for silent running. I could see this
maybe doubling our run time, but I’m not going to count that as an official
timing. It’s just a guesstimate.</p>

<p>Even with this near-perfect run, we ended up with a tally of 37. With even
slightly better rolls from the host in a couple of places we’d have hit 40. This
wouldn’t have meant instant death since we’re inside a host, but it still would
have placed 3 marks on Ms. Decker at once, and let the host see her and start
activating IC. She sure hopes the team doesn’t get into a firefight on the way
out, because if she has to do anything else Matrix-related to help then she is
definitely going to draw the ire of Overwatch.</p>

    Shadowrun 5th Edition's cover.

<p>For this post we’ll be taking a look at Shadowrun 5th Edition, originally
published in 2013. The book we’re looking at is the Master Index Edition
published in 2016, which is largely the same but incorporates some errata and
includes an index of supplementary material.</p>

<p>I’ll confess I have some reluctance to tackle this specific system, because its
return to expensive cyberdecks was part of what made me kinda stop paying
attention to Shadowrun at all. But I’ll read it with as open a mind as I can
manage and give its rules a fair shake just like I gave all the others.</p>

<p>One thing I notice is that they have switched back to the more “conversational”
style employed by SR1, which makes it much harder for me to understand the
rules. It’s more of a problem here than it was in SR 1 because there are a lot
more rules and concepts they’re trying to get across.</p>

<h2 id="setting-overview">Setting Overview</h2>

<p>Visually, the Shadowrun 5th Edition Matrix is a complete return to The Full
Gibson Experience. An infinite black plane criss-crossed by shimmering silver
lines, upon which swim thousands and thousands of icons representing small
connected devices and users. Way up above in the sky float the giant geometric
shapes of corporate hosts.</p>

<p>Descriptions focus almost entirely on the visual, with the technical bits
boiling down to “it’s everywhere” and “no one fully knows how it
works”. “Civilians” still use commlinks like they did in 4th edition, and
“smart” devices that are currently online around them show up as icons in
augmented reality. The descriptions we get for the uses of augmented reality
here are actually pretty good and evocative. However, it’s not the main
event. It seems that any time someone would use a web browser for something in
the real world, they go into full VR instead.</p>

<p>If this Matrix has any basis in reality, it would be on the popular perception
people had of the Internet in 2013, and the fears they had for its future. Cloud
computing is a concept that looms large here despite not being explicitly
named. A Matrix host is a location that doesn’t have a 1-to-1 correspondence to
a single physical device. In other words, the reason they’re all up in the sky
and visible from anywhere in the world is because they’re all <em>in the
cloud</em>. Access to cloud services also tends to be the explanation for why
certain devices gain mechanical bonuses when they’re online.</p>

<p>The Matrix is split into Grids. When you connect to the Matrix you are in
whatever local grid services your physical location. Big Corps have private
global grids where all their stuff lives. You can access stuff that’s in other
grids without going there, but for the best connectivity you’ll want to
grid-hop, which requires some hacking if you’re lacking credentials.</p>

<p>The “fears” part comes into play when the book says the Matrix is almost
entirely locked down and under the control of the megacorps. Those everyday
civilian uses are allowed, provided people pay their fees or consent to getting
bombarded with ads. The entire Matrix is watched over by the Grid Overwatch
Division, an organization composed of law enforcement and corporate specialists
whose job is to sniff out and eliminate any and all hacker activity.</p>

<p>“Hacker” here is an umbrella term that covers both <em>deckers</em> and
<em>technomancers</em>. Deckers use cyberdecks, devices which are a little bigger than
commlinks and have extra hardware that lets them be used for
hacking. Technomancers still use their quantum-bullshit-powered brains (and I
still think they’re cool).</p>

<p>Cyberdecks are back to being super-expensive, with prices comparable to those of
SR1. The cheapest deck costs the same as an armored cargo truck, the starter
used by our sample character costs a bit more than a luxury sports car, and the
best one costs the same as a couple of light military vehicles. Fortunately it
appears they no longer require much in the way of optional hardware
enhancements, and programs tend to be much cheaper, but still the price of a
deck is once again the main thing making “decker” an exclusive specialist niche.</p>

<h2 id="mechanics-overview">Mechanics Overview</h2>

<p>Devices have Matrix Attributes that dictate their base capabilities. All of them
have a Device Rating that represents their general robustness, a Firewall
attribute that is used for defensive rolls, and a Data Processing attribute that
gets used for searches and other generally lawful operations. Cyberdecks have
two others, Attack and Sleaze, which are used for hacking. Hosts have also have
these so that they can fight back against hackers. The full array is abbreviated
as “ASDF”.</p>

<p>Most devices, including hosts, have “static” attributes, but cyberdecks have an
“attribute array” of four numbers that can be allocated dynamically between
those last four values. Their device rating is still static and cannot be
changed.</p>

<p>Instead of having user accounts, each icon, device or host has a single owner
that has full control over it, and it might accept <em>marks</em> from other users on
to grant them more limited levels of access. An example is a social network host
lets users register by placing a mark. More marks means more access, and the
limit is three. The owner counts as having four.</p>

<p>Hacking a device means placing uninvited marks on it, and using the access those
grant to perform Matrix actions that get you closer to your goal. Different
actions require a different number of marks to attempt, and unless those marks
are legitimate most of them still require hacking tests to perform and might
fail. They’re opposed by the host’s rating and its ASDF attributes.</p>

<p>Hacking actions use either the Attack or Sleaze attributes. Attack actions are
“loud” and alert the host that it’s being attacked when successful; when they
fail, they cause Matrix damage to the hacker. Sleaze actions are “silent” and
don’t increase the hacker’s visibility when successful; when they fail, the host
becomes aware of the hacker, places a mark on them, usually triggers IC.</p>

<p>With both types of action, successes on the target’s resistance rolls increase
the hacker’s Overwatch Tally, even when the hacker wins the contest. When this
tally hits 40, GOD’s eye is upon the hacker. They take a boatload of damage, get
forcibly ejected from the Matrix, and their physical location is instantly
traced. In other words, game over<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If inside a host when this happens,
they’re “merely” instantly detected and have 3 marks placed on them at once,
which makes all the host’s IC extra effective against them. And you bet all that
IC will be activated at once.</p>

<p>Rebooting your cyberdeck resets Overwatch Tally to 0, but it also erases all
marks you’ve placed, so while you’ll usually reboot right after a run is
finished you’ll need to wait a bit longer if you still need those marks.</p>

<p>IC fights using the host’s rating and ASDF attributes. Some variants try to
place additional marks on the hacker, while some attack either the hacker’s
deck, their brain, or both at the same time. The more marks IC has on the
hacker, the greater the damage they do. It’s possible for the hacker to spend
actions removing these marks, but this ironically is also an illegal action and
accrues Overwatch. It also doesn’t make the host or the IC forget about the
hacker, it just makes enemy attacks less effective.</p>

<p>Matrix perception works a bit differently than in the past. Most icons in close
proximity (and there are several ways to define this) are automatically visible
and identifiable unless they’re <em>running silent</em>, which means they require a
Matrix perception test to notice. Running silent gives a penalty to all of that
icon’s rolls, so the hacker is usually the only one running silent during a run,
and that only when necessary.</p>

<h2 id="run-parameters">Run Parameters</h2>

<p>We’ll be using the sample decker from the core book, a dwarf lady. She has a
Hermes Chariot starter deck with a device rating of 2 and an ASDF of 5-4-4-2
(which is dynamic, as mentioned before). She has a few programs that help with
cybercombat but her specialty is still stealth, with an effective skill of 9 for
that approach.</p>

<p>It looks like our host design philosophy is The Full Gibson once again. A given
location will have a single host that takes care of all of its business and is
connected to the wider Matrix, only this time it represents a set of servers in
the cloud instead of a mainframe. Nevertheless it is considered to be at the
same physical location as the office.</p>

<p>There are rules incentives to being in close physical proximity to your target,
and our hacker lacks the accessory that would let us ignore those rules (a
Satellite Link), so she will be joining the physical team and hacking from the
inside.</p>

<p>This is a private business, so we’ll give the host a rating of 4 according to
the guidelines on page 247. Its ASDF ratings are 5-4-6-7, which gives us the
“surprisingly high security” requirement. Cameras, alarms, and door locks are
Rating 3. The alarm is running silent.</p>

<p>For IC, it runs Patrol at all times. When it detects an intruder it launches
Killer, followed by Track. When it detects unauthorized access to the buried
evidence it launches Sparky. As usual, whenever one of these is destroyed it’s
immediately relaunched at the start of the next combat turn.</p>

<p>The file containing our target evidence would normally be <em>archived</em> and thus
impossible to access without some social engineering, but we can cheat a bit
here and assume there’s a physical jack point in the records room that allows
access to the files.</p>

<p>With all this in place, we’ll see how our decker does next post.</p>

<p>omnipotent organizations that stand ever ready to squash players, and I guess
GOD made it in either because of their demands or because some of SR5’s writers
were ascended GMs themselves.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The last couple of posts have already covered all important locations inside
Evernight, so now we leave town to look at its surroundings.</p>

<h2 id="burning-woods">Burning Woods</h2>

<p>Turns out the surroundings are mostly on fire!</p>

<p>The Shadow reflection of the Neverwinter Wood started burning when Mount Hotenow
erupted and never stopped. The fire spread through the whole forest and the
trees still smolder decades after any mundane plant would have been reduced to
ash.</p>

<p>Travelers going from the city to the Wood first wade through a wasteland where
they’re calf-deep in ash sprinkled with embers. The smoke in the air becomes
thicker and thicker, with a color identical to that of the ash on the ground,
resulting in very poor visibility all around. Sometimes they’ll get ambushed by
burrowing undead jumping from the ash.</p>

<p>At the forest itself the road splits into several twisty forest trails that
weave through the incandescent trees. Despite being a navigational hazard
themselves, these trails are the only usable paths through the forest, and the
many bandits and predators who somehow live here know this. Where the world has
waterways, the Burning Wood has rivers of lava streaming from Hotenow.</p>

<p>Most of the Burning Wood has the extreme heat or pervasive smoke terrain
features, often at the same time. There might also be some squares with more
active fire-based hazards like cinder falls, caustic geysers, or the lava
rivers. And there are stats for an Ash Tree hazard (har har) that will try to
slam or grab passing PCs with its burning branches.</p>

<h3 id="den-of-the-hunters">Den of the Hunters</h3>

<p>Some sample opposition/dubious allies for the area. This band of erudite hunters
has a temporary shelter in an earthen cave that’s protected from the heat and
cinder falls. They’re made up of several mortal species, but their leaders are
shadar-kai. They have a pack of “hounds” who are former humanoids corrupted by
the Shadowfell, robbed of their sapience and reduced to walking on all fours.</p>

<p>The hunters welcome visitors, and would be happy to chat with the characters and
provide them with shelter and a place to rest for a while. That peace is
unlikely to last for very long, because soon it will be obvious that these
hunters hunt <em>people</em>, and they’ll either invite the characters along or decide
to hunt them. Either situation is likely to lead to violence.</p>

<h2 id="mount-hotenow">Mount Hotenow</h2>

<p>This Mount Hotenow is still erupting, making it much more dangerous than the one
in Toril. Some of its caves are still navigable, and might contain portals to
the middle world or the Elemental Chaos. These portals are usually controlled by
elemental creatures from the same group that inhabits the mountain in Toril, but
some of them also contain fire-themed undead.</p>

<p>Characters who have already fought and killed some of the elementals over in
Toril’s Hotenow might find themselves having to fight their ghosts here. There’s
also a small table with fire-themed heroic undead that could be found in the
place.</p>

<p>There doesn’t seem to be much of interest here, despite all that. Most parties
will only come here via a detour from the Toril version of the mountain as they
descend to Gauntlgrym. Perhaps this detour is the only path forward, as the
corresponding passages in the world are blocked by a cave in or some such.</p>

<h2 id="shadowfell-road">Shadowfell Road</h2>

<p>The Shadowfell Road is a ritual path. If you start at either end and follow the
proper boundary markers (alleys, tree arches, mountain passes), the
space-warping properties of the Shadowfell will carry you for a much larger
distance than the one you end up walking. The Road starts at the Thayan outpost
in Evernight, and ends in the Thayan city of Surcross.</p>

<p>Supplies for the Dread Ring arrive from Surcross via the Road, and then are
taken to another Shadowfell portal just outside Evernight that leads directly to
the fortress over in Toril.</p>

<p>To follow the Road you <em>have</em> so start at either Surcross or Evernight,
otherwise the magic has no effect. Not all of the intermediate stops are in the
Shadowfell either, or even located between the two physical ends. The Thayans
usually travel in high enough number to discourage attack by monsters, but small
parties of PCs won’t be so lucky.</p>

<p>The route along the road is not obvious. PCs who wish to follow it to Surcross
will likely need to track a Thayan caravan that’s heading there to pick up
supplies, or locate the next portal via applications of the Arcana skill.  If
they can’t find their way, they might need to travel back to the campaign area
the hard way. This is an excellent opportunity to include Shadowfell-based side
adventures, though I imagine your players might not be as happy about that as
you.</p>

<p>The book presents some of the stops along the way, in the order one would find
them when going from Evernight to Surcross.</p>

<h3 id="endless-alleys">Endless Alleys</h3>

<p>The portals leading to this place are easy to spot, because there will be a
bunch of empty Thayan wagons parked near them, probably guarded by undead. They
keep them in reserve at both ends because this area has to be traveled on foot.</p>

<p>This is an endless series of alleys. The buildings on either side are tall and
have no windows or doors. They go on forever - turning a corner leads only to
more alleys. It’s possible to climb to the roofs, and the view from up there is
an endless expanse of nondescript roofs with alleys between them.</p>

<p>After they’ve been here for a little bit, the PCs will start to see phantom
children holding toys. Their faces are expressionless but they giggle in an
unsettling manner. The ghosts will try to hug the characters, but their touch
inflicts necrotic agony. When one is destroyed, the child vanishes and the
toy drops to the ground, whining in disappointment as it dissolves. You can use
any kind of level-appropriate incorporeal undead stat block for them.</p>

<h3 id="still-waters">Still Waters</h3>

<p>This stretch of the Road is a swamp that looks exactly like you’d expect a
Shadowfell swamp to look. The road is made up of a bunch of logs lashed
together, and it branches off at points, going to gods-know-where.</p>

<p>There are small communities living here in small villages that can be seen off
in the distance. Their inhabitants move around on pole barges and keep to
themselves, but if you look closely you’ll notice they all wear
blindfolds. That’s because if you spot your own reflection in the water it will
animate and try to drown you.</p>

<h3 id="obsidian-ziggurat">Obsidian Ziggurat</h3>

<p>This part of the Road goes through an abandoned village, cutting right through
its center. The village itself is unremarkable, but the giant obsidian ziggurat
looming just outside it is very noticeable. The platform at the top of the
pyramid sometimes shows torchlight and moving shadows, though there are no
shapes casting them. They dance to the beat of an unhread drum.</p>

<p>The shadows make an attack against the Will of anyone watching them. Those who
are hit feel compelled to climb the steps of the ziggurat and join in their
dancing. Those who end up dancing for a minute or more are teleported to a
similar ziggurat in the world, in an area called the Lake of Salt. They’ll
appear among the snaketongue cultists and were-snakes that were performing a
ritual and are the ones actually casting those shadows in the
Shadowfell. Hilarity will ensue.</p>

<p>Those who get trapped like this can return to the Shadowfell Road by destroying
the altar in the Lake of Salt pyramid.</p>

<h3 id="village-of-the-mad-druid">Village of the Mad Druid</h3>

<p>This is a peaceful village full of people who are thriving as much as can be
expected in the Shadowfell… except that they all wear hilariously bad undead
disguises. You see, the village’s protector is an eladrin druid named Shalanka,
with stats as a twilight incanter. She went insane and has come to believe that
undeath is the natural order of things, therefore she must protect the undead
and kill the living. She is aided in this by a menagerie of undead animals.</p>

<p>Shalanka’s grip on reality is tenuous enough that the amateur hour disguises of
the citizens can fool her, and she does act as an effective protector for
them. She lets the Thayans pass through unmolested because she doesn’t have the
strength to oppose their large force, but she’ll feel pretty confident about her
chances of killing the PCs. Shalanka isn’t really evil, tough, and PCs who don’t
want to deprive the village of its protector might get bad disguises of their
own to avoid a fight or perhaps even try to heal her mind.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I love the idea of a ritual road, and I love that it seems to be a license to
add surreal and bizarre locations to a campaign. While I wouldn’t call the other
locations in the campaign “mundane”, the example ones here stand out for how
evocative and weird they are.</p>

<p>I also really like the imagery of the ash-choked, eternally burning woods. The
book really sells how dreary it is, and how hard it is to see anything. But
there’s not much reason to go there unless the GM places an important objective
somewhere in the woods. I wonder what Shandarar’s Shadow looks like.</p>

<p>After creating <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/11/03/hackaton-cp-red.html">both our netrunner and the systems she needs to hack</a>, we can
start the actual run.</p>

<h2 id="run-summary">Run Summary</h2>

<p>G0blin Jr. goes in with the physical team, they get past the reception, and as
the rest of the team pretends to work she locks herself in the bathroom to try
and hack the security server.</p>

<p>We are cheating a bit here, because it turns out you need to be within six
meters <em>and</em> within line of sight of an access point to hack the corresponding
architecture. I don’t want to actually map the whole office out like I would in
a real adventure, so we’re kind of assuming the wireless networks here have the
same coverage as in the SR 4 version. They want to track where all guards and
guests are at all times so there are security server access points in each room,
covering the whole office.</p>

<p>G0blin Junior’s strategy is to be meticulous and defeat each piece of ice as it
comes up, to avoid having them pile up on her. Still, even a meticulous approach
looks like a brutal all-out-assault here.</p>

<h3 id="security-server">Security Server</h3>

<p>Junior has no problem dealing with the Skunk ice at the top layer in the first
turn. She then uses the Pathfinder net ability to see deeper into the server and
rolls well enough to see the whole thing, even past the Password wall. She now
knows the exact route she must take - down the left branch to disable the alarm
and camera, and all the way down the right branch to unlock the back door and
plant a Virus to keep these things disabled after she logs out.</p>

<p>A quick peek at the files on level 3 sees they’re worthless, and then it’s on to
the main event: the fight against the Hellhound/Killer pair.</p>

<p>She beats the Hellhound in the contested roll, but loses to the Killer and so
loses a program at random: the Eraser. It’s completely destroyed. We’ll be
generous and assume she has backed-up copies at home, but they can’t be restored
within this run.</p>

<p>Fearing for her software more than for her brain, Junior focuses her attacks
this first turn on the Killer, destroying it after 2 Sword attacks.</p>

<p>After that we’re in for a slugging match with the Hellhound. It attacks once per
turn but always goes first, with Junior spending her 3 net actions per turn on
two Sword attacks and one Zap.</p>

<p>A good roll by the Hellhound in the following turn deals only 3 damage to Junior
(thanks to her Armor program), but also sets her on fire. She will begin taking
2 points of damage per turn until she spends a Meat Action to deal with
that. And she can’t afford to spend any Meat Actions now.</p>

<p>A series of bad rolls on her part mean she misses her first turn of attacks, so
has to take more burn damage next turn. Fortunately the Hellhound fails to
damage her, and she can finish it off then. But she needs to wait for another
turn and 2 more burn points to be able to put out the fire: you cannot spend a
Meat Action in a turn where you spend Net Actions and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Junior is down a program and 20% of her HP so far. Fortunately she doesn’t have
any problem going down the Architecture’s left branch and disabling the alarm
and camera.</p>

<p>The Skunk at the top of the right branch doesn’t give her any trouble. Turns out
Skunks are harmless when fought alone. The Asp in the next level beats the
initiative contest and destroys her Armor program, though it goes down to the
usual Sword, Sword, Zap combination.</p>

<p>Junior reaches the bottom of the security server, unlocks the door, and spends 2
Net Actions creating a Virus that will keep the security devices off after she
logs out. She then Cloaks her efforts and jacks out.</p>

<p>Total time taken for the security server: 19 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="secret-server">Secret Server</h3>

<p>A slightly singed G0blin Jr. follows her teammates to the records room and jacks
into the secret server she finds there.</p>

<p>The password is a breeze to blow through, and a good Pathfinder roll lets her
see all the way to the bottom of the server. The Skunk is easily defeated by
turn 3 of this hack. The Wisp loses initiative and goes down before it can
act. The Hellhound wins initiative and further burns out poor netrunner’s brain,
leaving her with 17 remaining HP since she has no more Armor program.</p>

<p>She manages to kill it with lucky Sword strikes before it can attack again, but
has to take 2 burn damage and spend a Meat Action extinguishing the fire. She
successfully IDs the evidence file and copies it. She knows there’s a Killer
further down but she’s hurt and down 2 programs, so she doesn’t risk engaging it
in order to cover her tracks. Junior jacks out.</p>

<p>Time for this hack: 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The team has fulfilled their mission, but unlike the hackers of every other
game, G0blin Jr. decides discretion is the better part of valor. She’s
half-dead, down two very important programs, and that office net might have
another Hellhound like the two others she jacked into today (it doesn’t, but the
doesn’t know that). Plus there’s a chance that a firefight is ongoing in the
meat world.</p>

<p>The team leaves with the evidence, but without the money.</p>

<p>Junior deciding to give on the money and just leave is the sensible roleplaying
choice. All netrunners are brave folks by definition, but someone who names
herself after a goblin would probably not be <em>suicidally</em> brave.</p>

<h3 id="but-what-if-she-was">But What If She Was?</h3>

<p>What if our Goblin had decided to brave the office network in her present state,
after all? What if she had thrown caution to the wind, messaged WITNESS ME to
her companions, and dove in?</p>

<p>She would have succeeded in 10 minutes, but just barely. The Asp takes out both
her Sword programs, and two max damage rolls from the Wisp leave her with a
measly 3 HP before she could derezz it and drain the office accounts.</p>

<p>Junior is probably not making it out of the office if any sort of fight
erupts. And if she does a good chunk of that money is going to pay for her
hospital bills. Her teammates will probably begin calling her “Crispy” if she
survives.</p>

<p><strong>Total Time Elapsed</strong>: 29 minutes if she doesn’t go for the money, 39 (and a
lot of pain) if she does.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-and-impressions">Analysis and Impressions</h2>

<p>29 minutes is well within our tolerance for a manageable amount of time, so we
can say that CP RED’s system remains fast. It took around 12 minutes for Junior
to disable the camera and alarm, which is about what I consider the upper limit
on the time you can keep the rest of the team waiting. You could cut to the
physical team at that time and go turn by turn to keep everyone moving.</p>

<p>Disabling the door has to happen in the same hack because the system resets when
the netrunner jacks out, but that’s an additional 7 minutes so it’s OK. The
secret server hack takes 10.</p>

<p>Going for the “easy” office server after being beaten up by the first two does
indeed border on the suicidal. It’s fast at 10 minutes, but not worth
it. Cutting your losses and leaving is a perfectly rational decision.</p>

<p>Because ye <em>gawds</em> is this system brutal.</p>

<p>Stealth is not a thing in these rules. The closest thing is the Slide ability,
but that apparently only works to escape combat, not to avoid it. Most ICE
threatens to either permanently destroy your programs or directly damage your
HP, and if I understood the rules directly they get a free and automatic hit
against you if they beat that contested initiative roll.</p>

<p>So avoiding combat is impossible, and getting out unscathed is extremely
unlikely. I feared I made the CP 2020 data fortress too easy, and here I think I
made things too difficult by having three decent-sized Architectures generated
with the random system. It looks like CP RED wants a single big Architecture per
adventure instead of a bunch of scattered smaller ones. If there are smaller
ones, they should be <em>tiny</em> with at most a single piece of ICE or Demon, to help
preserve the netrunner for the main event.</p>
