<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Mearedes is a goliath druid, the self-appointed Sentinel of Shault. Shault, in
turn, is a hidden island paradise in the Sea of Silt, one of the greenest areas
remaining in the Tyr Region, largely thanks to the efforts of Mearedes and her
disciples.</p>

<p>Those disciples are the giants Shakka and Shola, and the dwarf Hippolexes. They,
their master, and a few volunteers from the local stone and beast giant
communities intercept any strangers making landfall on Shault, and demand they
subject themselves to a ritual that prevents them from ever speaking about the
island to others. Those who refuse are killed. As you might imagine, very few
people ever return from Shault, and those who do aren’t saying anything about
it.</p>

<p>Though Mearedes has an age-lined face, she’s still as spry as a young goliath,
and has received the respectful title of “Little Grandmother” from the local
giants. Those who help her and her friends fight off threats to Shault will find
her to be a stalwart ally.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Mearedes, as mentioned, is a Goliath. She’s also a Level 18 Controller with 176
HP, Speed 6, and a lot of Classic Druid Powers, which might look very exotic to
typical Athasian characters.</p>

<p>She fights in melee with a <strong>Thorny Staff</strong> that damages and slows for a turn;
and at range with <strong>Flame Seeds</strong> that deal fire damage, and inflict 5 fire
damage on any enemy that enters one of the squares adjacent to the target or
starts their turn there before the end of her next turn. This means <em>the target</em>
can take this additional damage if they try to move.</p>

<p>And then there’s the expected <strong>Lashing Vines</strong> (recharge 6+), a fireball-sized
area attack that damages and then creates a zone of hazardous difficult terrain
that lasts for the rest of the encounter. It damages and slows those caught
inside. Yes, this is a recharge power, so the battlemap will become rougher and
rougher as time goes on.</p>

<p>As a minor action, Mearedes can assume the <strong>Form of the Ghost Panther</strong> for a
turn and shift 3 squares. In this form, she cannot attack but gains +4 Speed,
insubstantial, and phasing. She can end this as a free action or sustain it for
another turn as a minor action. And she also has the Goliath <strong>Stone’s
Endurance</strong> encounter power, which lets her gain Resistance 10 to all damage for
a turn.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Mearedes will almost always be accompanied by her three apprentices (whose stats
are left as an exercise for the reader) and by as many stone and beast giants
you need to make the fight interesting. She’s also clearly meant to be more of
an ally than an enemy here, so she or some of her apprentices could also tag
along with the group for a short while.</p>

        </h1>

  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Maetan is the current head of House Lubar, one of Urik’s wealthiest noble
houses. He’s been prepared for leadership since childhood, though his time came
much sooner than expected due to the untimely death of his parents.</p>

<p>The house makes its fortunes through commerce and through the ownership of many
profitable fields outside of Urik’s walls. The work on those is performed by
slaves, and their administration by junior house members. Senior leadership like
Maetan has loftier concerns.</p>

<p>Maetan, for example, is busy petitioning Hamanu for the opportunity to lead a
large army against the recently freed city of Tyr, as he has a story of success
against Urik’s smaller enemies and wishes to attain new heights of glory and
favor with the sorcerer-king.</p>

<p>This probably relates to the 2e Prism Pentad adventures, which saw the PCs take
part in a battle against Urik’s forces. If this happens in your 4e campaign,
Maetan will likely be at the head of those forces.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Maetan Lubar is a human, and a Level 16 Elite Controller with 302 HP. He fights
using a combination of the fencing skills and psychic powers taught to him from
a tender age.</p>

<p>The fencing is distinctly second fiddle here: just a basic <strong>Longsword</strong> attack
that does level-appropriate damage with no riders. Maetan wants to stay a bit
outside of melee range and use his many psychic abilities instead. He’s a
telepath, so all of his powers target Will.</p>

<p><strong>Serpent’s Kiss</strong> is a range 20 basic attack that targets up to 2 creatures,
deals psychic damage and makes the target grant combat advantage for a
turn. <strong>Insidious Worm</strong> is an at-will range 10 attack that can only be used
against targets granting him combat advantage; it deals psychic damage and
forces the target to make a melee basic attack against another target of
Maetan’s choice. His usual routine would involve alternating these two.</p>

<p><strong>Coils of Lubar</strong> is an area 1 within 10 attack that deals psychic damage and
restrains (save ends). It deals 10 psychic damage as an aftereffect of the
save. It recharges when he uses <strong>Psionic Augment</strong>, a power that triggers when
Maetan hits with one of his two ranged at-wills and further boosts their
damage. And this, in turn, recharges when he’s first bloodied.</p>

<p>His two final powers are <strong>Psionic Intrusion</strong>, a minor action ranged attack
that dominates on a hit (save ends). This recharges when he’s first
bloodied. And the <strong>Mind Fog</strong> encounter power, which triggers when he’s hit by
a melee attack, affects a Close Burst 3, deals psychic damage on a hit, and
forces the targets to treat him as invisible (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I guess this might be a typical example of an evil noble type. The book says
Maetan will always be accompanied by a sizable honor guard, and in a fight he
will try to use his powers to make things easier for those guards (all of them
are selective, so he has no risk of hitting his allies). It also says that
despite all of his psionic might, Maetan is still very proud and overconfident
of his sword skills, so he might end up letting a PC get too close to him
because of this.</p>

  <figcaption>

    her kingdom.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Lalali-Puy is the Sorcerer-Queen of Gulg, which is possibly the greenest
city-state in Athas. Out of all the Sorcerer-Kings, she’s also the most
personally beloved by her subjects, who call her Oba or Forest Goddess.</p>

<p>She uses her magic to bring rain to Gulg, and to protect it from threats both
external and internal. She also owns everything in Gulg, and is responsible for
seeing to its even distribution among the dagadas (communities) in which its
people live. If you’re a citizen of Gulg, everything you wear and eat, all the
livestock you tend and the land it grazes on, all belongs to Oba, who graciously
allows you to use it.</p>

<p>Of course, being a Sorcerer-Queen, Lalali-Puy has further dark secrets unknown
to common citizens. The description of her capabilities above might read as
“epic druid” to someone familiar with standard D&amp;D, but that’s a lie. The reason
she has so much power over her kingdom is because she keeps its primal spirits
enslaved through arcane magic. And the spirits hate her for it. Given the
smallest opportunity, they’d devastate Gulg’s dagadas in revenge.</p>

<p>Despite her villainy, Lalali-Puy is described as the most accomplished ritualist
on Athas. Many of the arcane and primal rituals on her extensive library are
unknown to even the other Sorcerer-Kings. PCs might find themselves having to
ally with her in exchange for a specific ritual… or plotting a heist to steal
it from her vaults.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We’ll take a look at some of Lalali-Puy’s servants here, and then at the
Sorcerer Queen herself.</p>

<h3 id="nganga">Nganga</h3>

<p>This is one of Lalali-Puy’s templars, known as ngangas (witch doctors). When a
citizen is selected for nganga training, they’re completely removed and isolated
from society. From that point on, they only appear in public wearing scary
demonic masks enchanted with fear powers.</p>

<p>The nganga we have here is clearly some sort of human warlock pacted to their
Queen. They’re Level 11 Artillery with 90 HP and Speed 6. They fight in melee by
bonking people with a <strong>spirit rattle</strong> that also serves as their
implement. Their basic ranged attack is a <strong>Ghost Lance</strong> (ranged 20
vs. Fortitude) that deals necrotic damage. They can also use <strong>Spectral Jaws</strong>
(Range 12 vs. AC) that deal force damage and immobilize (save ends).</p>

<p>The fear enchantment on the <strong>Devil Mask</strong> serves as a good keep-away power:
Close Blast 3 vs. Will, deals psychic damage and pushes 3 squares. At the start
of the target’s subsequent turns, the nganga can choose to push them 3 squares
(save ends).</p>

<p>Finally, they can curse someone with a minor action with <strong>Curse of the
Oba</strong>. The curse lasts until the end of the encounter, and they can keep cursing
multiple people. They also really want to do that, because when the nganga deals
damage to someone other than the cursed victim, the victim takes the same amount
of damage. If the PCs aren’t quick to deal with the nganga, they’ll soon find
their whole party being “focus-fired” at once.</p>

<h3 id="judaga">Judaga</h3>

<p>Judagas are the most elite warriors in Gulg. Like ngangas, they’re mostly
isolated from society, though instead of masks they wear special enchanted
leopard pelts preserved from the Green Age. Lalali-Puy has a honor guard of
judagas with her at all times, and they can also be seen moving among the
populace when she or the ngangas feel physical threats entering Gulg.</p>

<p>The example judaga here is a human, and a Level 25 Skirmisher with 231 HP. Their
speed is the usual 6, but they also have Forest Walk and a +2 to saves against
Charm and Fear effects.</p>

<p>Judagas fight with <strong>scimitars</strong> that do level-appropriate damage, and their
<strong>Leopard’s Fury</strong> maneuver lets them shift 6 squares and perform a special
attack at any point along the movement. This does a bit less damage than the
basic strike but also inflicts 15 ongoing damage (save ends) and pushes 2
squares.</p>

<p>Lastly, if the judaga happens to be within 6 squares of Lalali-Puy herself
(meaning they’re acting as a bodyguard) they can shift as a minor action.</p>

<p>The book explicitly calls judagas out as willing to perform a coup-de-grace on a
downed PC in the middle of a fight, which makes them a lot more dangerous than
their short list of abilities indicates.</p>

<h3 id="lalali-puy-sorcerer-queen">Lalali-Puy, Sorcerer-Queen</h3>

<p>The Oba herself is a human, and a Level 28 Solo Controller with 1032 HP and the
Leader tag. She has a ground speed of 6 and a teleport speed of 3.</p>

<p>Lalali-Puy is surrounded by <strong>Ravenous Ghosts</strong> (aura 5) that give a damage
boost to the melee attacks of any allies within the aura. Her <strong>Oba’s Ambition</strong>
makes her regain one of her 2 solo action points whenever an enemy cursed by her
drops to 0 HP.</p>

<p>As that description indicates, Lalali-Puy fights like a warlock. In a way, she’s
a “role model” for an epic-level warlock - someone who has long surpassed
whatever entity taught her magic in the first place, and who now makes pacts
with others to teach <em>them</em> magic in exchange for service.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with the curse-related powers, because those are the core of her
tactics. She can use <strong>Oba’s Curse</strong> once per turn as a minor action. This is
exactly the same curse the ngangas can use, the one that mirrors melee or ranged
damage inflicted on other enemies to the cursed victims. However, it’s (save
ends) instead of lasting the whole encounter, because Lalali-Puy’s attacks are
much stronger. Still, a string of bad save rolls could still have her “focusing
down” the whole party a once.</p>

<p><strong>Oba’s Vengeance</strong> makes that a scenario a certainty when the PCs manage to
bloody her: this is a Close Burst <em>15</em> attack that affects enemies, deals
necrotic+psychic damage, and stuns for a turn on a hit. It also curses every
target <em>as an effect</em> (save ends).</p>

<p><strong>Oba’s Blessing</strong> is a free action power that lets Lalali-Puy remove her curse
from a victim to end an effect on her or on an ally within 20 squares, so here’s
her stunlock protection.</p>

<p>Keep that damage mirroring effect in mind as we look at her “normal”
attacks. All of them have additional things they do to curse victims.</p>

<p><strong>Repelling Touch</strong> is the melee basic attack. It deals force damage, pushes the
target 5 squares, and then pushes all other enemies cursed by her 2 squares as
an effect. <strong>Spirit Maw</strong> is the ranged basic attack. It deals force damage,
slides 4 squares, and slides every other cursed enemy 2 squares as an effect.</p>

<p><strong>Spirit Gale</strong> is a fireball-like attack (Area Burst 2 within 15). It targets
Will, deals necrotic+psychic damage, and immobilizes (save ends). This
downgrades to “half damage and slowed for a turn” on a hit, but as an <em>effect</em>,
it lets her slow one cursed enemy she can see (save ends). The first failed save
from that enemy makes them <em>stunned</em> (save ends).</p>

<p>Her one power without any curse bonuses is <strong>Oba’s Punishment</strong> a reaction that
triggers when she’s hit by an attack from an enemy within 15 squares. It’s a
counterattack that deals psychic damage and teleports the target 10 squares on a
hit. Since this is written as a Close Burst, it doesn’t benefit from damage
mirroring, but it will still trigger pretty often.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I love Lalali-Puy’s mechanics. If the PCs end up fighting her, she will have an
honor guard of judagas with her to use as distractions, all of which probably
benefit from Ravenous Ghosts. And then she’ll curse as many people as she can
and focus her single-target attacks on the weakest of them.</p>

        </h1>

  <figcaption>
    Jossi the Juggler, juggling
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Jossi gets a mention in the description of the city of Tyr in the Campaign
Setting book, and a full writeup here. She’s a member of Tyr’s Eyes, which was
originally a group of beggars, street performers and thieves who banded together
for mutual support. Nowadays they also act as a kind of freelance spy agency,
keeping an eye on what goes on in the city both to improve their own chances of
survival and to sell the juiciest gossip to whoever has the money to pay for it.</p>

<p>Jossi is known as a street performer, doing a pretty impressive routine on the
markets of Tyr. She supplements her income with theft and information
broketing. I think both books’ emphasis on her might mean they intend Jossi to
be the PC’s first point of contact with Tyr’s Eyes during your typical campaign.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Jossi is an elf, though her speed is only 6 and they forgot to add her low-light
vision. After so many sorcerer-kings, it’s interesting to find a plain old Level
4 Skirmisher with 55 HP in the Personages of Athas section.</p>

<p>She fights with the same <strong>Daggers</strong> she uses in her juggling act, and her
<strong>Juggling Slash</strong> technique lets her target Reflex instead of AC, deal the same
damage as a basic attack, slide the target 2 squares, and shift 2 squares. This
is <em>at-will</em>, making her very annoying to fight. On any turn where Jossi shifts
as a move action, she also gains a bit of bonus damage courtesy of her <strong>Fancy
Footwork</strong>.</p>

<p>As soon as she realizes the odds are against her, Jossi will try to
escape. <strong>Distracting Toss</strong> helps with this: when someone makes a melee attack
against her, the can shift her speed as a reaction to reach any square on the
map that has any amount of cover or concealment, and then make a Stealth test
with a +5 bonus (total +16) to become hidden.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Mildly interesting, I guess. Jossi is clearly more on the “possible ally” than
on the “enemy” side of the balance, so unless the PCs go out of their way to be
assholes or to antagonize Tyr’s Eyes, they won’t be fighting her. If that ends
up happening, though, Jossi will not be alone. You should assemble a team of the
many “low-Heroic street scum” stat blocks available here and in other books to
act as the fellow Eyes members who come to her aid.</p>

<p>It could be interesting to have Jossi as an active ally in one or more fights,
using these stats. Juggling Slash has hilarious synergy with what PC rogues can
do, and Distracting Toss is a good way to quickly leave the fight in case her HP
starts to run low.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>If you’re following the RPG.net thread with the Campaign Guide reading, you will
already have seen a description of House Tsalaxa on <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/wir-4e-dark-sun-campaign-guide.925494/post-25647852">this post</a>. They’re one
of the dodgier merchant houses with a presence in Tyr.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>House Tsalaxa: Based in Draj and known for blackmail and spycraft, trades in
rope, grain, and previously owned cargo. Emblem: two glaring, bestial eyes.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Haneth Tsalaxa is the head of their Tyr branch, and he has a very unpleasant
reputation amongst his neighbors. He apparently has tons of dirt on everyone in
the city. Most of his fortune comes from blackmail and information brokering. If
you see him darkening your doorstep, prepare for an unpleasant conversation.</p>

<p>The secret of his success, which no one but him knows, is that he has a natural
ability to change his shape. He has no idea <em>why</em>: changelings are apparently
unheard-of in Athas, making him possibly the only one. He does exploit this
power as much as he can, disguising himself to better infiltrate private places
and overhear all sorts of interesting gossip. In addition to blackmail, he’s
also willing to do espionage and assassination for hire, though his prices are
ridiculously high.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Haneth is either a 4e changeling or mechanically indistinguishable from one:
he’s a Medium Natural Humanoid with the Shapechanger and Changeling tags, and a
Level 9 Elite Lurker with 154 HP.</p>

<p>He fights with a <strong>Short Sword</strong> that deals standard physical damage and
inflicts ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends) if he has combat advantage, and can
also throw <strong>Daggers</strong> that target Reflex and deal decent damage. His <strong>Slick
Swordplay</strong> lets him make 2 sword attacks and shift 3 squares before, between,
or after them.</p>

<p>He’s improved upon the classic “pocket sand” technique and can throw a <strong>Handful
of Poison</strong> (recharge 5+) in a close blast 3, dealing poison damage and blinding
on a hit (save ends).</p>

<p>He also has a couple of classic changeling minor actions: <strong>Changeling
Disguise</strong> lets him change chape to appear like any Medium humanoid. His
clothing and equipment remain the same, so it might be a bit hard to use in
combat, but it does help a lot when assembling a disguise. He can copy specific
individuals, but only if he’s seen them before. <strong>Haneth’s Trick</strong> (recharge 6+)
can make one enemy automatically grant combat advantage to him for a turn.</p>

<p>There is no DC to pierce the Changeling Disguise. Presumably you can use the
default rules and roll a contest of his Bluff of +12 against the Insight of any
investigators.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Haneth’s ability spread makes him more of a skirmisher with reduced AC and HP
than a proper lurker. The ongoing poison damage from combat advantage is better
than nothing, but be lacks something like a Sneak Attack or a really strong
ambush power.</p>

<p>Good thing he always has plenty of bodyguards around whenever he’s not in
disguise. He’s a major employer of unscrupulous Mixed Groups of People. Gotta
spend money to make money.</p>
