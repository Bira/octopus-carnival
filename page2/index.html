          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I’ve published an article about <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html">underwater adventuring</a> in the past, in
which I mentioned that “fish-people” had several advantages over “land-lubbers”
when it came to mobility and fighting in an underwater environment. A later post
included <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/11/13/underwater-items.html">a few items</a> that could help those land-lubbers close the
gap… so how about we take a look at those fish-people now? As a bonus, you get
a nice little bundle of setting info you can drop on your campaign if you want.</p>

<h2 id="the-fate-of-atlantis">The Fate of Atlantis</h2>

<p>The name “Atlantis” figures in the myths and legends of many more places than it
should. Cultures that have never heard of each other have stories about an
empire that ruled the waves in ancient times but no longer exists. The stories
might differ but the name is always the same.</p>

<p>That’s because ancient Atlantis was the largest and most powerful underwater
civilization to ever exist. They discovered a means of traveling to other worlds
and exploited it with gusto.</p>

<p>Despite its power Atlantis eventually fell, as all empires do. The exact
sequence of events is more or less impossible to piece together, and mostly
irrelevant in the present day. The important bit is that their inter-world
travel network was the first thing to go, instantly fragmenting the
empire. That’s why each of them has a different story about how Atlantis fell -
those stories talk only about the bits of it they knew about. In some, it
happened overnight due to a cataclysm. In others, they eventually morphed into
successor cultures that might still be extant in the present day.</p>

<p>Aside from giving rise to a whole bunch of legends and to fueling the occasional
would-be despot’s ambitions, the most enduring legacy of Atlantis was its
underwater engineering. They pioneered a lot of the techniques that used to make
sturdy weapons and tools out of implausible aquatic materials like bone, shell,
coral, and mother-of-pearl. They were also the first civilization to
successfully make and work orichalcum.</p>

<p>But we’re not here to talk about <em>stuff</em>, we’re here to talk about <em>people</em>.</p>

<h2 id="so-lets-talk-about-people">So Let’s Talk About People</h2>

<p>Opinions differ on whether Atlantis was a Golden Age utopia or a despotic empire
whose downfall was a blessing to the world, but everyone agrees it was pretty
diverse. Unlike most typical dungeon fantasy kingdoms, its citizens belonged to
many different species with none of them making up an overwhelming majority of
the population.</p>

<p>Many of Atlantis’ citizens can be described using already-published stats. Sea
Elves and Water-Infused from GURPS DF 3: The Next Level fit very well, as do the
Argonians from <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html">this post</a>. The octopus- and shark-folk from GURPS Banestorm
are also good fits, though they’re a bit more complex and costly than the
standard for DF racial templates.</p>

<p>Below are a few new templates, with the overall goal of allowing a diverse
all-underwater party if the group wants to play that type of campaign. A couple
of the new ancestries I present here might have equivalent official templates
already, but since I don’t have those I’m writing new ones for my own use.</p>

<p>These templates assume that being Amphibious also makes you able to see and hear
unimpeded while submerged, and the ability to breathe underwater also makes you
able to speak there. I feel this is in line with the simpler feel of Dungeon
Fantasy. If you want to follow Banestorm’s assumptions instead, give all
templates here one level of Nictitating Membrane {1} and Speak Underwater {5},
increasing their costs by 6 points each.</p>

<h3 id="atlantean-20-points">Atlantean (20 points)</h3>

<p>This template describes people who are a product of successive generations of
intermarriage between the other species that made up the population of Atlantis,
and possibly some surfacers too. They are known as “Atlanteans” because their
general look became associated with that empire. Surprisingly, they look a lot
like humans even when they have no humans among their ancestors.</p>

<p>Atlanteans are warm-blooded, have legs, and can breathe both water and
air. Their human-looking bits exhibit the same ethnic variety as
humans. Individuals can also have a variable number of “fishy” traits like visible
gills, fins, blue or gray skin, and so on. These might be visually striking but
are never significant enough to count as more than 0-point features.</p>

<p>Atlanteans can appear in worlds that had an Atlantis, or those whose underwater
peoples are generally friendly with each other. The base stats could also be
used as they are or modified a bit to represent any species of underwater
humanoid.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Amphibious {10}, Gills {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Those fishy bits might count as varying levels of Unnatural
Features in a setting where almost everyone is human and the character is the
only known Atlantean, but in all other situations they’re 0-point traits. If the
character has something like rigid fins or a prominent tail growing out of their
lower back, they might need adapted body armor. This doesn’t cost extra, but
might restrict their usage of looted armor.</p>

<h3 id="crab-folk-40-points">Crab-Folk (40 points)</h3>

<p>Crab-folk are sapient humanoid crustaceans easily distinguished by their heavy
segmented carapaces. Like crabs, they lack distinct heads and their eyes are
located at the end of a pair of flexible, retractable stalks. Unlike crabs, they
only have the usual complement of humanoid limbs, though these are still
armored.</p>

<p>Crab-folk can operate normally on the surface, but their gills begin to dry out
if they go more than a day without being immersed in sea water. This means they
tend to stick close to the coast. Their voices sound strange and “bubbly”
outside the water, which most surfacers find off-putting.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: 360-degree Vision {25}; Amphibious {10}; Gills {10}; Damage
Resistance 5 (Cannot Wear Armor) {15}; No Neck {5};</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Cold-Blooded {-5}; Disturbing Voice (In Air, -50%) {-5},
Dependency (Sea water, Daily) {-15}.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Traits</strong>: If your campaign takes place far from a coastal area, the
Dependency disadvantage is worth -30 points, and the template therefore costs
only 25. Your local alchemist can prepare a solution close enough to seawater to
satisfy the requirement, but it’s still not free.</p>

<h3 id="deep-ones-50-points">Deep Ones (50 points)</h3>

<p>These humanoids are much more obviously “fishy” than Atlanteans, with an anatomy
closer to that of an abyssal fish than a human’s. They’re adapted to the
lightless depths of the ocean and that’s where they prefer to make their
homes. Deep Ones can swim up to the shallows without suffering ill effects, but
can’t breathe air.</p>

<p>After Atlantis fell, it was not uncommon for its Deep One settlements to become
more isolated and break contact with shallower or surface communities. This some
times gave rise to sinister legends and rumors about what they got up to down
there. These are mostly bunk: they are no more prone to worshiping Elder Things
than any other species.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Amphibious {10}, Dark Vision {25}, Fangs {2}, Gills {0},
Pressure Support 3 {15}, Tough Skin 1 {3}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Cold-Blooded {-5}.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Traits</strong>: A variant that can operate on the surface would be closer
to several classic D&amp;D fish-people. They have the 10-point version of Gills and
so cost that much more.</p>

<h3 id="merfolk-20-points">Merfolk (20 points)</h3>

<p>Merfolk are humanoid from the waist up and have fish bodies from the waist
down. They can breathe both air and water and have naturally melodious voices in
both mediums, but they require magic or assistive devices like wheelchairs to
operate on land. Their human halves display the same variance as Atlanteans, and
their fish halves can resemble a variety of species of fish, shark, or cetacean.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Gills {10}, Voice {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: No Legs (Aquatic) {0}.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>: The “Leg” and “Foot” hit locations on merfolk refer to their tail
and lower fins instead. Armor for those locations must be specially
constructed. As usual this doesn’t cost extra but limits which looted armor they
can use.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Traits</strong>: If your character’s fish half mimics a particularly speedy
species, they might have Enhanced Move 1 (Water) for an extra 20 points. At the
GM’s option, this might be a matter of training instead of biology, which means
any merfolk character can buy this with earned points as a power-up.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2024/01/28/hackaton-hwi.html">The Great Tabletop Hackaton: Hard Wired Island</a>

<p>Hard Wired Island is a cyberpunk game published by Weird Age Games in 2020. It’s
a beefy 400 page tome comparable in size to the Shadowrun or CP RED cores, but
only about 25% of that is rules.</p>

<h2 id="setting-overview">Setting Overview</h2>

<p>Hard Wired Island takes place in Grand Cross, an O’Neil Cylinder habitat
orbiting Earth’s Lagrange 5 point, in the “distant future” of 2020. It was built
according to an idealistic plan in the wake of terrible environmental and
economic disasters on Earth, but is currently in the process of being co-opted
and corrupted by the interests of ultra-rich corporations and elites. The way in
which this is happening is described in very realistic detail throughout the
book, which also talks a bit about what people do to fight back. PCs are usually
expected to help in that fight, if not for moral reasons then because those
billionaires cause constant economic shocks that threaten their survival. This
is the main conflict in the setting.</p>

<p>Grand Cross has cybernetic implants, gene editing, fully sapient AI and
androids. However its “global net” is still pretty much the internet
of 2020. It’s even <em>named</em> “the internet”.</p>

<p>Every building in the station is wired for high-speed internet. The airwaves are
serviced by cell carriers like the ones you know from the real world, and some
of its wards even have free public wi-fi, though that tends to be poor quality
because capitalism is the worst virus. The station is linked to Earth’s internet
by satellites, with a 1.2-second lag there due to the physical distances
involved. Most big services have station-local data centers to try and get
around this, and there are some GC-native ones as well like HeoCities (website
hosting) and Pulser (a Crosser social network).</p>

<p>Hackers are simply called hackers. Their equipment is collectively known as a
Hacking Suite, and it can be anything from computers that wouldn’t look out of
place here in the real world to some fancy cybernetic implant. Target systems
tend to be private corporate intranets or other networks located on the station,
and whether hacking is done remotely or on-site depends on the specific mission.</p>

<h2 id="mechanics-overview">Mechanics Overview</h2>

<p>Most tests in Hard Wired Island use 2d6, with bonuses coming from one of the
PC’s main stats/approaches (Cool, Clever, Tough, and Quick), from a skill
specialty, from Augments (implants), and from Assets, which are special
equipment. There are rules for rolling with advantage/disadvantage (add a d6 and
drop the lowest/highest) or for Boosting rolls (add a d6, don’t drop
anything). Criticals happen when two or more dice roll the same value.</p>

<p>The system for hacking is a mixture of the systems for stealth and social
interaction. It has a set of specific actions associated with it, but also uses
some actions from those other systems.</p>

<p>Hackers begin each hacking attempt in a state called “Ghost”, meaning they
haven’t been detected by the target system’s security. They also begin with
three chances to avoid getting caught. Every time a hacker needs to do something
that requires a die roll, they might get caught if that test fails, and must
spend a chance in order to avoid that. If they fail a roll after running out of
chances, they’re discovered and their physical location is traced. Security is
on its way, but the hacker can still disconnect and try to run. A hacker can try
a Cover Your Tracks action to restore lost chances, but that’s also a roll so it
might backfire.</p>

<p>Target networks have two stats: a Network Level that determines the basic
difficulty of all tests made against it, and a Mood that describes the
strictness of its security procedures and how willing it is to let you do
things. Hacking is mostly about improving the network’s Mood towards
you. <em>Friendly</em> networks are helpful, giving Advantage for data searches within
then. <em>Indifferent</em> networks neither help nor hinder. <em>Hostile networks</em> assume
everyone is an intruder until they can prove otherwise.</p>

<p>Most networks start out Indifferent, and their mood can be improved to Friendly
through hacking actions, or degrade to Hostile by failures. Hostile networks
can’t have their mood improved except by gaining admin access. This can be done
by succeeding at a number of rolls equal to its Network Level, but it’s not
strictly necessary to accomplish your goals. Admin access on a network makes it
Friendly, and prevents its mood from lowering. Doing anything in there becomes
almost trivial and you only need to maintain Ghost if someone intelligent is
monitoring the network (like another admin or an AI).</p>

<p>There’s no deadly ice here, and no cybercombat at all. Getting discovered and
traced is usually enough of a threat here, since those armed goons will kill you
just as dead, and the heightened state of alertness from the target will also
complicate your teammates’ lives.</p>

<p>Hard Wired Island tries to abstract the extensive planning sessions players of
other games engage in with a resource named “Prep”. Before the mission itself
you use actions to gather both Individual and Group Prep, and you spend those
points during missions to use your Assets or acquire new ones on the spot.</p>

<h2 id="run-parameters">Run Parameters</h2>

<p>We do have a sample hacker here, the ever adorable Maru. Her Hacking Suite is
built into her cybereyes but she still operates it with a keyboard. She will be
going with the team on this one, which might mean leaving that keyboard behind
but won’t affect her effectiveness.</p>

<p>We will once again go with three separate target networks here. The office
network is level 5 and Friendly to access from the inside; the security network
used by the guards is Indifferent and level 6; and the isolated server is
Hostile and level 7.</p>

<p>If the first two detect intrusion they grow Hostile, trace Maru’s location, and
notify both the guards and the police. If the secret server detects intrusion it
will destroy itself in a very messy and noisy fashion, drawing guard
attention. This counts as a mission failure for our purposes, since the team
will spend the rest of the run trying to leave the office without the evidence
they came here to collect. As these are separate networks they have separate
Ghost counters.</p>

<h2 id="run-summary">Run Summary</h2>

<p>For the first time in our series we’ll have to concern ourselves with stuff that
happens before the mission itself. Let’s make an Individual Prep roll for
Maru. She’s getting her software in order before the run, at her hacker den. We
roll 2d6 + Clever + Hacking + Hacker’s Den against a difficulty of 7, and get
a 11. Since this is the first Prep roll we’re making, Maru gains 1 automatic
Prep, and an extra 1 Prep for beating the difficulty by 4. She takes part in
Group Prep later, and let’s say they agree to leave 1 of those points for her
use.</p>

<p>Now for the actual run. As always, the rest of the team manages to bullshit the
receptionist and make into the office posing as a repair crew. Maru locks
herself into a stall in the ladies’ room and begins.</p>

<p>The security network isn’t advertising itself, so I rule Maru needs a Search
roll to find it. Her bonus here is +3 from Clever and +2 from Hacking; the
difficulty is 11 (the network’s level + 5). She succeeds with 13.</p>

<p>Since there’s a lot she must do in this net, we spend 1 of her 3 Prep to
activate the Data Bomb program Asset, which gives her Advantage on her next
three rolls here.</p>

<p>I rule that opening the door and turning off the camera each require an Operate
roll. From what I see in the rules this seems to use the Drone specialty instead
of Hacking. Maru doesn’t have that, so she’s rolling only 2d6+3 from her
Clever. Thankfully, the Data Bomb still gives her Advantage on these rolls. She
succeeds at both rolls with a 12 and a 11, precisely because of that Advantage.</p>

<p>Maru and her team move to the records room, and find the secret server. She
jacks into it and begins searching for the data. The difficulties here are all
12 from the Network Level. Maru spends another Prep to activate the Ghost
Protocol program, giving her Advantage on her next Hacking roll and an extra
Ghost chance. These rolls <em>do</em> use her Hacking specialty.</p>

<p>Advantage once again lets her succeed with a 14. I think succeeding at this lets
her take the data? Let’s be cruel instead and ask for a Spoof roll to download
the data without authorization. This is a Hostile server after all. No more
advantage here, but she still gets a 13.</p>

<p>The team leaves the records room and Maru connects to the security wifi to open
the exit door. She still has one roll with Advantage remaining from her use of
Data Bomb, and succeeds on the Spoof roll with a 13.</p>

<p>With the way out secured, she searches the office network for the money. No roll
needed to locate it, it’s Friendly and advertising itself to people inside the
office premises. A Search with Advantage lets her find the money with a roll of
11 versus the network’s lower difficulty of 10.</p>

<p>She has no advantage for the Spoof roll to transfer the money elsewhere, but she
still succeeds with a 11.</p>

<p>Mission accomplished! Time elapsed: around 15 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="run-analysis">Run Analysis</h2>

<p>Hard Wired Island feels more complex than Neon City Overdrive in its
presentation, but the hacking sequence here was about as fast. This was in part
due to good rolls all through the run, but a failure here would have had less
impact than in my Neon City run. There, a failed roll would have meant
cybercombat, a system I didn’t get to try at all. Here it would have meant an
extra roll or two as I lost one of my Ghost points and retried the test. Perhaps
I’d have spent another action or two recovering those points as well.</p>

<p>Keeping it to about one roll per Thing You Do seems to be key to keeping hacking
brief.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/11/27/neverwinter-surcross.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: Veil and Surcross</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>And finally we get to look at the Thayan cities and the road between them.</p>

<h2 id="veil">Veil</h2>

<p>The town of Veil is so named because it’s built atop a stable rift to the
Shadowfell, which makes it look like it’s covered by a veil of shadows from
afar. This is where Shadowfell Road ends. Valindra’s people are very aware of
that, so they’re busy fortifying the town and bringing in undead defenders to
gradually replace its living garrison. Should the down fall or the rift close,
their Neverwinter contingent would be cut off.</p>

<p>The rift also protects Veil from direct bombardment by the flying fortress, as
it makes its shadow-powered projectiles go astray. Its defenses cannot stand up
to a Netherese ground assault, but the attacking army would risk getting caught
between Veil’s defenders and a relief force sent from Surcross. The fortress
therefore focuses on the bigger town, but sometimes comes here to float
ominously over Veil and throw some rocks at it. As we saw before it does this
when it needs to take in supplies, as its own Shadowfell portals require
proximity to a rift to work.</p>

<p>The city’s defenses are led by a priest of Bane named Renault Abrecht, who
coordinates everything from the local temple he took over. When not doing that,
Abrecht spends his time ensuring the forces under his command are more loyal to
him than to Thay, and acquiring more converts from the town’s stressed-out
population. When he judges he has a big enough army of followers, he will cross
into Shadowfell Road and collapse the rift behind him, hoping to conquer a
kingdom for himself elsewhere in Faerûn. The Netherese would actually love that,
as it would achieve their own goal of cutting off Valindra’s supply route.</p>

<h2 id="the-road">The Road</h2>

<p>The road linking Veil and Surcross is warded and trapped to a frankly ridiculous
level, because the Thayans rightly fear that if it got taken then Veil would
fall soon after.</p>

<p>Both sides of the road are lined with stakes upon which are impaled
bodies. These are enchanted to animate, jump from the stakes, and kill anyone
who attacks the town of Veil or a Thayan national while on the road. Under the
road itself are a series of deadly necromantic rune traps that activate when
anyone living steps on them. They deactivate for five minutes if an <em>undead</em>
being steps on them, so caravans to and from Surcross use zombie guides to
travel the road.</p>

<p>I guess it’s possible for the PCs to travel overland between the two cities
without using the road, since by this point they should be able to navigate the
area’s environmental hazards without much trouble. Armies, however, would prefer
to use the road if they can, and supply caravans must use it.</p>

<h2 id="surcross">Surcross</h2>

<p>Tam was smart enough to foresee any serious attack against Thay would have to go
through Surcross, so he had potent defenses installed in the city a long time
ago. However he couldn’t imagine that the actual attack would come in the form
of a whole Netherese flying fortress, and the particulars of that attack lead to
the current stalemate.</p>

<p>Surcross is a town under permanent martial law. It’s governed by the military
garrison stationed here to fight the Netherese. Its civilian population is
suffering greatly because the soldiers requisition all the food for themselves,
and don’t hesitate to kill any who complain about it or displease them in other
ways. A dead Thayan is just an undead Thayan in waiting, after all.</p>

<p>Getting into the town is hard and will require some ingenuity from the
party. Once inside, though, they can easily pass for residents, because who in
their right mind would want to break <em>into</em> the place?</p>

<p>The town’s governor is Ukulsid, an undead gnoll general who is entirely focused
on the war effort, and therefore dislikes the fact that his town also became the
center of Valindra’s schemes. His loyalty to Tam forces him to obey her, though,
because she outranks him.</p>

<h3 id="external-defenses">External Defenses</h3>

<p>The gates of Surcross are made of necromantically animated bone. They open and
close themselves at the orders of Thayan military necromancers, and will attack
others who linger close to them for too long like the animated wall traps we saw
earlier in the Dread Ring.</p>

<p>The wall surrounding Surcross is pretty solid, and also festooned with hundreds
of hidden crypts. If the wall is breached or bypassed by enemy forces, a single
command will trigger a selective zombie apocalypse. Every corpse within the wall
will be animated and the shambling army will be sent into the town to kill every
non-Thayan they find.</p>

<h3 id="fingers-of-szass-tam">Fingers of Szass Tam</h3>

<p>These five bone and marble towers are the reason Surcross hasn’t been flattened
yet. Located at equidistant points around the perimeter of the city wall, they
can project force fields over the city. They can’t cover the whole city for
long, so the towers usually project stronger but smaller fields over whatever
parts of it are being bombarded.</p>

<p>The towers have no windows, but their walls are enchanted to “not exist” to
anyone inside them. They’re filled with arcane artillery pieces similar to those
that defend the plateau, whose crews can see and fire through the walls just
fine. They also have assault units ready to deploy to anywhere inside the city
or to just outside its walls by marching on force field bridges.</p>

<h3 id="the-garrison">The Garrison</h3>

<p>Another important structure in Surcross’ defense, the garrison houses all living
Thayan troups stationed in town. It’s guarded around the clock by undead. Its
barracks are not segregated by gender, but by species: human, orc/half-orc,
gnoll, and “other”. It has short-range teleportation circles that can move
soldiers instantly to the front gate or to any of the five Fingers.</p>

<p>A particularly luxurious section of the garrison is reserved for the Sunmasters,
a contingent of Bane clerics and star warlocks who specialize in radiant
attacks. They mostly work as a special strike force against the Shadovar, or
when there’s an emergency and they need every soldier in the field.</p>

<h3 id="the-tombstone">The Tombstone</h3>

<p>This squat fortress at the very center of town is where its leadership
resides. Its windows and doors can be commanded to meld into the walls and
disappear, allowing it to serve as a last redoubt if the wall is breached.</p>

<p>Ukulsid holds court here and lets people petition him for judgment on disputes
or to make other requests and complaints, but since he tends to draft those who
annoy him into the army, few people make use of the opportunity.</p>

<p>The building also contains an enchanted audience chamber that’s a perfect
replica of the one Szass Tam uses in his palace. It’s one of many such chambers
spread throughout Thay. The lich can sit in his throne in the original chamber
and establish a link with any of the replicas, causing an illusion of him to
appear on the corresponding throne. This lets him talk to anyone inside the
replica chambers as if he was there, and lets him forcibly teleport people
inside the replica chamber to the original one if he wants. Ukulsid occasionally
uses this room to report to his boss. PCs should probably avoid lingering here.</p>

<p>Valindra has an area reserved for her use underneath the Tombstone as well. This
currently stores a large and still growing collection of dragon bones, guarded
by skeletal guardians hidden among them. Valindra is stocking up in preparation
for the time when she learns the ritual to raise dracoliches.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Surcross looks like an even worse place than Evernight, and that’s saying
something. PCs who make it inside the walls will have some freedom of movement,
but still their stay there will resemble a dungeon delve more than a city
adventure. Nowhere is safe, no one can be trusted, and you ideally want to do
what you came to do and leave as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>If the PCs main reason for coming to Thay is to disrupt the Thayan supply lines,
then Veil is probably their best bet, since the portal can be closed without
them needing to destroy either city. If the GM says Valindra’s Soul Vessel is
here in Thay, though, then its most likely hiding place is her bone collection
under Surcross’ Tombstone.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Kolthunral is the Netherese flying fortress currently besieging Surcross. We’ll
look at it first because it kinda dominates the skyline and its goals are
important to contextualize everything else that’s going on in this area.</p>

<p>The arrival of the fortress was a complete surprise even to Szass Tam, who
considered the current conflict with the Netherese to be a distant and minor
dispute over Shadowfell supply routes way off to the west in Neverwinter.</p>

<p>That conflict is happening because, as we already know, both sides have ongoing
plots happening in the Neverwinter area and need a constant influx of material
and personnel from home: Valindra’s group is at the Dread Ring, and Clariburnus’
group is at Xinlenal. The Prince of Shade evidently disagreed with the lich
about the importance of the dispute and dispatched the fortress to solve it once
and for all.</p>

<p>There are many rumors and theories about why Szass Tam hasn’t gotten personally
involved in this battle. Some say that if he did it would attract the collective
attention of the other Princes of Shade and lead to one of those Realms-scouring
epic level wars everyone wants to avoid. Others say he realized all of this is
ultimately Valindra’s fault and he wants to see how she gets out of it.</p>

<p>Kolthunral is captained by Duchess Antheriss, one of Prince Caliburnus’
subordinates. She was a shadar-kai in life, and is now a Spirit Devourer.</p>

<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>

<p>Kolthunral uses the same principles as any Netherese flying enclave to stay in
the air, with a <em>mythalar</em> and everything. The thing that makes it atypical is
that it’s thoroughly militarized. Most of the inhabitants are soldiers, and the
rest are only here to work support jobs for the army.</p>

<p>The bottom of the flying island is encased in thick enchanted metal armor, and
the city has towers jutting out at all angles (even from the bottom) festooned
with siege and anti-air artillery similar to the engines used by Thay to defend
its borders.</p>

<h3 id="spatial-distortions">Spatial Distortions</h3>

<p>The interior of the fortress is partly made of shadow-stuff that warps and
distorts space, meaning it’s bigger on the inside and can actively misdirect and
confuse intruders. The same techniques were used to build its ultimate weapons,
the meteor tubes.</p>

<p>Meteor tubes are, well, straight metal tubes that connect the inside of the
fortress to circular hatches in its bottom armor. Their enchantments make them
“ritual paths” very similar to the Shadowfell Road. You drop a big rock through
the entry hole of a meteor tube, and it falls an unfathomable distance through
the weirdest and most inhospitable reaches of the Shadowfell, coming out the
exit hatch at a speed many times greater than terminal velocity. They’re hard to
aim precisely, but the kinetic energy of an impact is so big it can obliterate
everything within a few dozen yards.</p>

<p>A meteor salvo could flatten Surcross or Veil if it hit directly, but the
cities’ defenses have held so far. Surcross has a force field projected by its
five defense towers, and Veil has the Veil of Shadow that gives it its
name. This is the main cause of the current protracted siege.</p>

<h3 id="the-prison-of-night">The Prison of Night</h3>

<p>Kolthurnal’s prison is a large empty chamber where prisoners are held in place
by levitation magic near the center of the space. They’re stuck in place because
they’re too far away from the walls to push off, and the magic is too strong to
let them move by random thrashing. There’s only the one door, and it’s always
guarded, just in case.</p>

<p>This room is reserved for those the Shadovar judge might be useful in a future
hostage exchange, which to them means officers or members of “civilized
races”. Lower-ranking orcs, gnolls and undead are instead killed outright.</p>

<h3 id="movement-and-power">Movement and Power</h3>

<p>Kolthunral can fly at a leisurely ten miles per hour, and the only thing
limiting its maximum altitude is the fact that it’s not sealed against
vacuum. It could easily have flown over the plateau to attack the Thayan
heartland, but it’s actual goal is to stop the Thayans from using Shadowfell
Road. To do that it needs to destroy Veil and/or Surcross.</p>

<p>The fortress contains doors that are enchanted to become portals to the
Shadowfell when it passes over an area where the boundaries are
weak. Ironically, this means that it hovers over Veil whenever it needs to take
in new supplies.</p>

<p>The city’s mythalar power plant is stored in a nondescript tower near its
center. It’s a standard piece of Netherese tech. Destroying it would make the
city drop from the sky. There are actually rules for this!</p>

<p>Magical safety measures slow the city’s fall, but its mass is so high they can
only do so much, and only for a short time. This gives occupants (and PCs!) time
to evacuate, but they’re still in for a bad time if they fail to do so. And you
<em>are</em> supposed to give them a good chance to get out - the goal would be to
scare them, not force a TPK.</p>

<p>When the city hits the ground, effects depend on what its initial altitude was
when it started falling. If it was 100 feet or less, everyone inside takes
damage as if they had fallen that distance - the slowed fall speed is
counteracted by all the collapsing buildings. If it was higher, everyone inside
will be automatically squished.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>It looks like this region presents the PCs with a sticky situation. Kolthunral’s
goals align perfectly with their own, but both factions here are pretty
terrible. The group can side with one to defeat the other, but the victor will
get a significant boost back in Neverwinter. PCs who don’t want either of them
to win will have to defeat them both here in Thay.</p>

<p>I usually write about roleplaying games around here, but I just spend quite a
bit of time chasing down a weird computer issue and I want to write about it
somewhere to record the steps I took.</p>

<p>If you’re not a big Linux nerd, feel free to skip this. If you <em>are</em> and have
issues with how I did things, feel free to skip this as well. If you want to
read this anyway, I try to explain some of the basic concepts behind this
quixotic adventure in footnotes.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What Happened</h2>

<p>I run Ubuntu on my home desktop, and I currently updated to the latest release
version, 23.10. It was a small upgrade, as I was already running
23.04. Everything worked fine.</p>

<p>Then I saw <a href="https://youtu.be/Yi5LFtNTGrs?si=CaEw_fKJMYLh7191&amp;t=256">a video</a> with some news about version 545 of the nVidia drivers
being released. I was using 535, which again worked fine, but I heard that
545.29.02 fixed a lot of bugs and added some improvements I had been waiting
for.</p>

<p>These weren’t part of the official Ubuntu distribution yet, so I added the
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa">Graphics Drivers PPA</a> to my system, which did have them:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa

<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I installed the new drivers, tweaked my Firefox config to use Wayland<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and
tested the new setup with a Youtube video. I saw that the videos there remained
weirdly laggy, so I went back to X11 but decided to keep the new driver around
for its other improvements.</p>

<p>It worked quite well for games and everyday usage… but I noticed that my
Youtube videos were still weirdly laggy on X11, and that my computer was
getting quite a bit hotter while playing them than it used to. The “Stats for
Nerds” menu told me they were dropping more or less 50% of their frames, which
is <em>bad</em>.</p>

<p>A little investigation showed me that the Firefox browser did not in fact play
very well with that new graphics driver, at least not in the Snap version that
was installed by default on Ubuntu Linux<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It didn’t really “see” my video
card and so was sending all of its graphical work to the processor instead. It
already did this with videos, but now it was doing this for everything.</p>

<p>The easiest solution to this problem <em>by far</em>, would have been to go back to
version 535 of my graphics driver, the one I had before that worked just fine. I
could wait for this stuff to get fixed upstream without worrying about it.</p>

<p>This is not what I did.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did-instead">What I Did Instead</h2>

<p>I went spelunking into the depths of DuckDuckGo, looking for a way to enable
hardware-based graphical acceleration on Firefox. That would make it use my
video card both for displaying web pages and for playing video.</p>

<p>Firefox has been able to do this for a while now, but the option was only
enabled by default on Windows or in Linux computers with Intel graphic cards. I
have an Nvidia card with proprietary drivers, so I’m out of luck.</p>

<p>Firefox uses something called VA-API to talk to the video card when hardware
acceleration is on. On machines like mine the capability is forcibly disabled,
because those drivers don’t support VA-API. It’s possible to bridge the gap, but
the process for that seems to be a bit experimental still. Most people do not
have the time or inclination to worry about that, and are happier for it.</p>

<p>After some trial and error, this was the sequence of events that led me to
success.</p>

<h3 id="step-one-bridging-the-gap">Step One: Bridging the Gap</h3>

<p>A developer with the horrible user name of El Farto has <a href="https://github.com/elFarto/nvidia-vaapi-driver">a Github repository</a>
that contains the code for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvidia-vaapi-driver</code> a little wrapper program that
translates VA-API calls into something the Nvidia drivers understand and
vice-versa. The package is actually part of my default Linux distribution, but
since I’m on the 545 drivers I needed a more recent version straight from the
source. That’s v0.0.11, which has support for those drivers.</p>

<p>Following the excellent documentation in that repository, I did the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Compiled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvidia-vaapi-driver</code> v0.0.11 from source and installed it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edited <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/default/grub</code> and changed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code>
variable to the follwing:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"quiet splash nvidia_drm.modeset=1"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Edited <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/environment</code> and added the following environment variables to it:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME</span><span class="o">=</span>nvidia
<span class="nv">MOZ_DISABLE_RDD_SANDBOX</span><span class="o">=</span>1
<span class="nv">NVD_BACKEND</span><span class="o">=</span>direct
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I rebooted my computer, and found out the Snap version of Firefox didn’t
detect my video card. Whoops!</p>

<p>The next step was therefore to get rid of Snap Firefox in favor of the
traditionally-packaged version. Give up? Never!</p>

<h3 id="step-two-fox-replacement-surgery">Step Two: Fox Replacement Surgery</h3>

<p>First, I added the repository with the “traditional” packages for Firefox:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I added a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/apt/preferences.d/mozilla-firefox</code> with the
following contents:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Package: firefox<span class="k">*</span>
Pin: release <span class="nv">o</span><span class="o">=</span>LP-PPA-mozillateam
Pin-Priority: 1001

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This ensures that the PPA’s version is chosen over the Snap. The next step is to
remove the Snap and install the traditional package:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>snap remove firefox

<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt remove firefox

<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-t</span> <span class="s1">'o=LP-PPA-mozillateam'</span> firefox
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since my user profile is in my home directory this preserved all of my bookmarks
and add-ons. Whew! And Firefox could now see my graphics card.</p>

<h3 id="step-three-chant-the-deep-magic">Step Three: Chant the Deep Magic</h3>

<p>The final step was to change some advanced browser configurations in the dreaded
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">about:config</code> screen.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gfx.webrender.all</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> -&gt; This lets it use the graphics card to
render web pages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> -&gt; for video acceleration</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">media.rdd-ffvpx.enabled</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> -&gt; This disables the built-in-software
codecs in Firefox.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gfx.x11-egl.force-enabled</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">widget.dmabuf.force-enabled</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> -&gt;
These are needed to get past the “hard blocks” imposed on the browser due to
its default configuration.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These take effect after I restart the browser. Finally, hardware acceleration
works! My computer heads up considerably less than it did, my videos in Firefox
have a buttery-smooth framerate, and I only had to battle a maximum of two Elder
Things to acquire the knowledge of how to do so.</p>
