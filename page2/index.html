<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was a town named Gerot at the foot of a mountain near the
city-state of Raam. Its people were great warriors, but also haugthy. When the
Sorcerer Queen Abalach-Re sent them an offer of alliance in exchange for them
joining Raam’s legions, they signaled their refusal by killing the envoys.</p>

<p>Abalach-Re was obviously very angry at this, so she double-cursed the people of
Gerot: they would be afflicted with an unquenchable thirst <em>and</em> pure water
would become like a poison to them. In short order, the entire town was
dead. The bit the queen hadn’t predicted was that the dead of Gerot would rise
again, as the first thraxes.</p>

<p>A thrax is a water vampire. Still afflicted by the sorcerous curse, it suffers
from constant, unquenchable thirst, which it tries to satisfy by draining the
fluids from the flesh of the living. Thrax victims become desiccated husks, and
it’s said to be an agonizing death.</p>

<p>Unlike a standard D&amp;D vampire, a thrax seems to retain the mind and personality
it had in life. This means they’re even more miserable, tormented not just by
their cursed thirst but also by their regret at having to feed. Prime personal
horror material there.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, we’re talking about the thraxes that seek revenge on
Abalach-Re by haunting Raam and drinking her supporters dry. I imagine those are
a fair bit less conflicted than the others.</p>

<p>Thraxes can drain fluids through skin contact, and they also have this trick
where they can cause a victim’s fluids to all move close to the skin, making the
victim bloated and easier to drain.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We only get a single stat block here, so let’s get right to it.</p>

<h3 id="thrax">Thrax</h3>

<p>The thrax shown here is Medium Natural Humanoid (undead) and a Level 11 Lurker
with 88 HP, putting it about on par with the traditional vampires from the
Monster Vault. It has darkvision, Resist 10 Necrotic, and Vulnerable 5
Radiant. Unlike a lot of other undead, it has no special resistance against
poison and disease. And unlike a traditional vampire, it is not vulnerable to
natural sunlight.</p>

<p>Thraxes are surrounded by <strong>Roiling Shadows</strong> which give them +2 to defenses
against ranged attacks, and their <strong>Clinging Grasp</strong> makes them insubstantial
and immune to forced movement while they have a creature grabbed. This takes
away the PC’s easiest tactic for making them let go.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is the <strong>Grasp of the Dead</strong>, which deals necrotic damage. If
the thrax has combat advantage, a hit also grabs the victim, which has a -5
penalty to escape rolls.</p>

<p>Once it has a creature grabbed, the thrax can proceed to <strong>Drain Fluids</strong>, which
deals heavy necrotic damage, heals the thrax for 10 HP, and ends the grab. If the
attack bloodies the target, they also fall unconscious (save ends).</p>

<p>The thrax can also attack with <strong>Flesh Bloat</strong>, the “trick” mentioned
above. This is an at-will melee attack that deals a bit more necrotic damage
than the Grasp, and also dazes and slows the target (save ends both).</p>

<p>Standard tactics for a thrax will likely be to bloat their intended victim, grab
them with Grasp of the Dead, and then Drain Fluids, repeating as necessary.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Water vampires feel much more appropriate for Dark Sun than the traditional
blood kind. I’m guessing all the traditional vampires in Athas must have melted
in the heat from all those layers they tend to wear.</p>

<p>Thraxes will probably only join up with other thraxes, and a fight against five
of them will be nightmarish for the party. You could also mix it up with other
relatively “dry” undead types. Maybe angry ghosts, or the animated corpses of
their dried-out victims.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>If our previous entry was kind of vague about whether tareks were a product of
the genocidal “Cleansing Wars” in Athas’ distant past, this one is pretty
categorical. Tembos are bioengineered terror weapons, created using magic most
foul for the purposes of facilitating genocide.</p>

<p>The “Champions” of that time (which unknown to most are the sorcerer-kings of
today) created them to sneak upon the homes of their opponents, and take from
them those they loved most. In addition to their stealthy forms and sharp fangs,
they received a limited ability to blend with shadows, the power to bite
someone in the soul, and a sophisticated intellect that is entirely devoted to
finding new ways of fulfilling their purpose in crueler ways.</p>

<p>They have survived as a species to this day, roaming mainly through the western
wastelands of the Tyr region, but they have been sighted elsewhere too. There’s
no one to give them specific targets any more, so they choose their victims
themselves, for food and fun.</p>

<p>Confirmation that a tembo is targetting a settlement is one of the only things
that will immediately end any infighting and other disagreements and make its
whole population unite against the threat. Everyone hates these things more than
they hate each other, which is saying something in Athas.</p>

<p>How exactly these attacks happen vary with the creature’s whims, as well as with
what it judges to be the most effective tactic for a given situation. Sometimes
they stay hidden and let their deadly magical aura slowly kill the population,
and sometimes they tear people apart in broad daylight.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Tembos are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts and Level 6 Solo Skirmishers with 280
HP. Their <strong>Killing Presence</strong> acts as an aura (2) that deals 5 necrotic damage
to anyone who starts their turn inside. When the tembo is bloodied, its <em>second</em>
aura kicks in. <strong>Tainted Wounds</strong> (aura 5) halves any HP recovery from healing
effects for those inside.</p>

<p>As a solo, the tembo has <strong>Double Actions</strong>, meaning it rolls initiative twice
and takes full turns in both counts. And finally, it’s <strong>Immovable</strong>, being
completely immune to any kind of forced movement, and getting a free save
against being knocked prone.</p>

<p>The monster’s main attack is a <strong>Bite</strong> that damages, inflicts a -2 attack
penalty for a turn, and serves as a carrier for the <strong>Unspeakable Violation</strong>
secondary attack. This targets Fortitude, and on a hit eats a healing surge and
doubles the damage from Killing Presence against that target for a
turn. Fortunately, it has Recharge 6+, so it doesn’t happen with every bite.</p>

<p>Its attack it’s likely to use the most is a <strong>Raking Assault</strong>, which deals the
same damage as the bite then lets the Tembo shift 4 squares and use the bite. So
that’s two or three attacks for the price of one, with the creature being able
to do this two times per round.</p>

<p>Its camouflage powers take two forms: <strong>Blending</strong> (encounter) is a move action
that makes the tembo invisible for a turn or until its next attack. And <strong>Shadow
Evasion</strong> (recharge when first bloodied) is a reaction that triggers when it’s
hit by a melee or ranged attack, letting it shift 4 squares and become
insubstantial for a turn.</p>

<p>Having two full turns per round can actually make Blending last even less, so
it’s not something a tembo will use to lie in wait for a long time. It will
instead rely on mundane stealth for this. Then it will charge in, use as many
Raking Assault flurries as it can, and combine Shadow Evasion with Blending to
escape from sight, only coming back to attack when its enemies’ guards are
down. Its ability to delete healing surges makes such long-term harassment
tactics even more effective, since it will obviously attack you in your sleep
and stop you from taking a long rest. Fighting the creature to the finish
in a single encounter will require preventing its escape somehow.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>What a horrible, horrible monster.</p>

<p>Tembos are almost always found alone. As mentioned above, everyone hates these
things. They will sometimes join together in small packs, but these end up
breaking apart pretty soon because they suck at organizing themselves.</p>

<p>We’re back to using the s-word for this one, though it only appears once.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>According to the book, legends tell that “an entity of mad destruction” created
the tareks in the very distant past to serve as “instruments of murder”. I guess
this means that they were created as bioweapons for the genocidal wars of the
Red Age, which would explain why they’re so strong and tough. In any case, their
earth priests helped them revolt against their masters and attain independence.</p>

<p>In our narrative present, tareks live in isolated communities in Athas’ hilly
and moutainous regions. They’re intensely isolationist and xenophobic, so most
of the contact they have with other humanoids is when they raid any of their
communities that might be located too near to tarek territory.</p>

<p>While they seemingly hate everyone, they are “sworn enemies of the gith”. Like
all particularly strong humanoid species, they’re popular targets for slavers
because they do well at the arena. It’s no wonder most revolts in Athas seem to
start there…</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Tareks are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 6. Their signature
trait is <strong>Deathless Warrior</strong>, which lets them roll a save when they hit 0
HP. If they pass, they only drop at the end of their next turn, and can act
normally until them. They speak Common and Giant, and are Unaligned by default.</p>

<p>The book recommends adding additional varieties of tarek by taking orc stat
blocks and replacing their bonus charge speed and Warrior’s Surge with Deathless
Warrior. So I guess they’re explicitly Darker and Sunnier orcs.</p>

<h3 id="tarek-raider">Tarek Raider</h3>

<p>Raiders are Level 3 Soldiers with 49 HP. They’re disciplined and try to stick
together in a fight even if scattered by forced movement. Their <strong>Tarek Squad
Tactics</strong> give them Combat Advantage against anyone adjacent to at least one
other Tarek.</p>

<p>A raider is usually armed with a <strong>Bone Heartpick</strong> whose attacks damage, slide
1 square, and mark for a turn on a hit. If someone decides to ignore the mark,
their <strong>Dangerous Aggression</strong> gives them a free attack against the offender,
and if that hits the target is also immobilized (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="tarek-earth-shaman">Tarek Earth Shaman</h3>

<p>Earth shamans are Level 4 Controllers with the Leader tag. They fight much like
Earthbenders from the Avatar shows.</p>

<p>Their melee attacks use <strong>Fists of Stone</strong> which target Fortitude, damage on a
hit and slide 3 squares as an effect. They can also use a spell named
<strong>Clutching Stone</strong> (close blast 3 vs. Fort, recharge 5+) that does the same
damage, knocks targets prone, and restrains them (save ends). And their ultimate
technique is <strong>Tide of Stone</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Ref, recharges when first
bloodied), which deals heavy damage and knocks prone on a hit. Allies caught in
the blast can instead shift 3 squares as an effect.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Tareks will only buddy up with other tareks and whatever domesticated beasts
they might train. You will only find them in Mixed Groups of People if they’re
enslaved.</p>

<p>As seen above, they like to stick close to each other in fights, and the book
also mentions they like the same focused fire tactics that tend to be described
as optimal for PCs. In other words, if they can they’ll pick a particularly
vulnerable target and focus their attacks there until the target is dead before
moving on to the next.</p>

<p>I believe this entry confirms that different monster entries in the Catalog are
written by different authors, because its description of Athasian lizardfolk is
as even-handed and respectful as the one for muls was racist, and they’re not
even playable by default!</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, ssurrans are Athasian lizardfolk. They’re as adapted to the
desert wastes as their relatives from other worlds are to swamps. Like all other
humanoids in Athas, their daily goal is survival.</p>

<p>Ssurrans (also known as “sandscale lizardfolk”) organize in nomadic tribes made
up of several family groups and a number of reptilian beasts that serve the
usual purposes from hauling cargo to helping in fights. They hunt, forage, and
sometimes raid while on the move.</p>

<p>Ssurran raids on settled communities are downright merciful when compared to
most others described so far. They allow the inhabitants to flee and only kill
those who try to fight back. Then they steal every usable good they can carry
and move away, taking care to erase their tracks and lay some false trails to
deter pursuers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Ssurrans are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Reptile and Lizardfolk tags. They
have a ground speed of 6 with Earth Walk, and speak Draconic. While this entry
only has two stat blocks, it does outright say that you can take any standard
lizardfolk from other books and replace Swamp Walk with Earth Walk to get a
sandscale version. You can also apply one of the monster themes found in the
back half of the book (and which we’ll see eventually).</p>

<h3 id="ssurran-shaman">Ssurran Shaman</h3>

<p>Sandscales have a long tradition of worshipping the sun and related primal
spirits. A shaman’s duties also include preserving their tribe’s oral history
and culture.</p>

<p>Your typical ssurran shaman is a Level 3 Controller with 47 HP. They fight with
a Spear that damages and pushes 1 square on a hit, and can cast at-will <strong>Sun
Curses</strong> (ranged 5 vs. Reflex) that deal fire damage and daze for a turn. Their
<strong>Treacherous Spirit</strong> spell (ranged 5 vs. Will, recharge on a miss) dominates
the target (save ends).</p>

<p>Despite their low-level, ssurran shamans are pretty dangerous and are likely to
be an unfortunate PC party’s first introduction to the Dazed and Dominated
conditions.</p>

<h3 id="ssurran-hunter">Ssurran Hunter</h3>

<p>These make up the bulk of any ssurran scout, hunting, or raiding party. They’re
Level 4 Minion Skirmishers that fight with <strong>picks</strong> that deal a little extra
damage to enemies granting Combat Advantage. If an enemy hits one of their
adjacent allies, the hunter can use <strong>Sidestep</strong> as a reaction to shift 1
square.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Ssurran tribes tend to stick together. Lone lizardfolk will either be outcasts,
or the last survivors of their tribes. Sometimes, slavers kidnap their young for
sale as “exotic merchandise”, so they might be found among enslaved guards or
gladiators.</p>

<p>I really like the way they were described in the book - my text here is barely
paraphrased. Simply by describing these lizardfolk as <em>people</em>, it already
allows me to imagine a bunch of situations where they’re potential oposition but
where things can still be solved by means other than murder. They also make
great potential allies in many other scenarios, because even when a group of
ssurrans is not nice there will likely be someone much worse nearby.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Dark Sun is still a D&amp;D setting. Therefore it needs giant spiders.</p>

<p>Athasian giant spiders behave much like their kin from other worlds. They prefer
locations that afford them plenty of hiding and ambush spots like caves, deep
valleys, and so on. While neither of the varieties presented here can spin webs
fast enought to do so during combat, they still might cover entire chasms or
large passages in them as they wait for more prey to wander by.</p>

<h2 id="crystal-spider">Crystal Spider</h2>

<p>One of the prettiest monsters in the Tablelands, its carapace is made of actual
crystal. Aside from the usual venomous bite and their razor-sharp appendages,
crystal spiders also have smome power over light and are capable of radiant
attacks.</p>

<p>Crystal Spiders are Large Natural Beasts and Level 4 Lurkers with 39 HP. Their
ground and Spider Climb speeds are both 8, and they have Tremorsense 10 to
detect people touching their webs. Their carapace makes gives them Resist 5
Radiant, but also Vulnerable 5 Thunder.</p>

<p>It also gives them the <strong>Gleaming Carapace</strong> trait, which gives them concealment
until the end of their next turn any time they move more than 5 squares in the
same action. I guess glare is a major problem with fighting crystal spiders on
their home turf.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a decently damaging <strong>Razor Leg</strong> (melee 2), and they can
use a <strong>bite</strong> (melee 1 vs. Fort) against a target that cannot see them, dealing
both immediate and 10 ongoing poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Crystal spiders could achieve that unseen state by moving more than 5 squares
and hiding, but they have a couple of shortcuts in the form of their
light-bending powers. <strong>Radiant Agony</strong> (close burst 2 vs. Fort) pushes its
targets 3 squares and blinds them for a turn, recharging whenever no one is
blinded or when the spider hits with its bite. <strong>Brilliant Ray</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Ref, recharge 5+) does a good chunk of radiant damage and blinds for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="crystalline-web">Crystalline Web</h3>

<p>Any place where crystal spiders hunt will be filled with these razor sharp
traps. They’re statted up as Level 4 Obstacles, each consisting of a patch of
webbing 4x4 squares in size, stretched between two surfaces. They’re
semi-transparent and require a DC 14 Perception check to notice in bright light,
or 19 in dim light.</p>

<p>When a character enters a web square, the web attacks their Reflex, doing
immediate and ongoing 5 physical damage on a hit (save ends). Hit or miss, the
target’s movement ends and it gets pushed back to the last square it occupied.</p>

<p>A character can use Acrobatics (DC 14) to move through a webbed square, or they
can attack the web and deplete its 25 HP to destroy it.</p>

<p>An elite version of this trap has 50 HP instead, and deals increased damage when
it catches someone. In either case, good luck dodging these in dim light or
while blinded by the crystal spiders who made them!</p>

<p>The book doesn’t explicily state it, but I would say crystal spiders should be
immune to the effects of their own webs.</p>

<h2 id="white-widow">White Widow</h2>

<p>White Widows are a bigger, stronger, and <em>stealthier</em> relative of the crystal
spider. While they lack the ability to fire lasers, they still have some control
over light and like to blind their prey. They’re Huge Natural Beasts and Level
15 Lurkers with 110 HP, resist 10 poison and radiant, and Vulnerable 10
thunder. Their speed and senses are the same as a crystal spider.</p>

<p>The reason white widows like to blind their prey is that they deal 15 ongoing
“poison and radiant” damage (save ends) when they hit blinded targets with any
attack. Yes, this means their venom is deadly even to things that are normally
resistant or immune to poison. This trait is named <strong>Combat Advantage</strong> but
that name is misleading, as it only grants its benefit against <em>blinded</em>
targets.</p>

<p>The spider’s <strong>bite</strong> is a basic attack that also deals “poison and radiant”
damage, but it’s not going to be used on its own unless conditions are
right.</p>

<p>Instead of biting it can turtle up and use its <strong>Reflective Defense</strong>, which
gives it a +5 bonus to all defenses for a turn and blinds anyone who misses them
with an attack during that time. The <strong>Scuttling Attack</strong> maneuver (recharge 5+)
lets it shift half its speed, bite someone, and shift the other half.</p>

<p>When hit by a fire, radiant or lightning attack (in other words, anything shiny)
the spider can react with the <strong>Venomous Dawn</strong> attack, enhancing and reflecting
that light back at its attackers. This is a Close Burst 5 vs. Reflex, deals
radiant damage, and blinds (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="widows-web">Widow’s Web</h3>

<p>Any battle against white widows will happen in a place filled with
these. They’re not sharp like a crystal spider’s, but they’re still quite
dangerous as Level 15 Obstacle traps.</p>

<p>White widow web patches are 10x10 squares in size and require a DC 22 Perception
check to notice in dim light, but are automatically visible in bright
light. The web attacks the Reflex of anyone who enters one of its squares, and
restrains on a hit (save ends). Webbed squares are also difficult terrain to
anyone without the Spider Climb ability.</p>

<p>Characters can avoid the trap by leaping over webbed terrain, or destroy the web
by dealing 40 HP of damage to it. An elite version has double the HP and can
take two opportunity attacks per turn, which is useful in case two or more
targets get pushed into it in the same action.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>You’ll mostly commonly be meeting these spiders singly or in pairs, with the
rest of the encounter balance being made up of web patches. They can appear
anywhere you would expect to find the standard varieties of D&amp;D giant spider,
which also exist in Athas because why wouldn’t they?</p>
