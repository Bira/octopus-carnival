  Zeburon
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Zeburon is the leader of the Black Sands Raiders, a brutal and feared bandit
gang that hides out in the Black Sands. According to rumor they always number a
hundred, and ride war-trained kanks to assault caravans and settlements around
the Black Sands.</p>

<p>The Iron Rider got this title because of his signature metal helmet, which has a
pair of prominent horns and completely conceals his face. Not even most of the
Raiders have ever seen it - only his most trusted lieutenants (such as the
defiler Fevik) know what he looks like.</p>

<p>And this is because Zeburon’s big secret is that he’s a tiefling. The book lists
reasons why no one has figured it out yet, and they’re actually a little
funny. He lacks a tail because he cut it off himself years ago. People tend to
mistake the reddish tone of his skin for sunburns instead of natural
pigmentation. And they think the horns are part of the helmet, when in fact
they’re poking through a pair of holes in it.</p>

<p>Zeburon hides his true nature from the rank and file of his gang because he’s
afraid of how they’d react if they found out. Given bigotry is never in short
supply around Athas, I’m guessing the answer is “not well”. And being a fearsome
individual warrior is not very helpful if about ninety guys on war kanks decide
they want you dead and charge you all at once.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Zeburon is a Level 12 Elite Soldier with 246 HP. He has a ground speed of 6,
low-light vision, and Resist Fire 10.</p>

<p>All of his attacks deal bonus damage against bloodied targets due to his
<strong>Bloody Violence</strong> trait. He fights with a <strong>Bastard Sword</strong> that can make
standard basic attacks and be used in a <strong>Wild Bloodletting</strong> maneuver,
attacking a Close Burst 1. A hit deals damage, slows the target, and inflicts
ongoing 10 damage (save ends both). This recharges when he’s first bloodied.</p>

<p>As a minor action he can use his <strong>Iron Fist</strong> (metal gauntlet!) to make another
attack, which does the same damage as the sword, and immobilizes for a turn.</p>

<p>Finally, he has the tiefling <strong>Infernal Wrath</strong> power which, when used, gives
him a bonus to attacks and damage against any enemy that hit him since the end
of his last turn. This lasts for a turn or until he hits an enemy.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>A fight against Zeburon will also include a sizable contingent of Black Sands
Raiders, as well as his best buddy and top lieutenant Fevik the Defiler. Plus
any amount of kank mounts you deem necessary. It will likely come after the PCs
have fought multiple encounters against the raiders, too.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure I’ve seen someone a lot like Zeburon in one of the many Brom
illustrations for DS: muscles, leather straps, face-concealing horned helmet,
menacing pose.  I haven’t read any older DS material to know whether he’s
someone from the old days, or if he’s new and just likes following local
fashions.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>“Wait,” you might ask, “are you still doing this?”. Yes, I am! I have been doing
it since shortly after the last time I talked about it, off and on, but I
haven’t posted anything else here in the blog for entirely personal reasons that
I should overcome any day now.</p>

<p>And we’re going to start with a little correction here, because over the course
of my play, I’ve looked at the timelines a bit closer and the details for the
Knight of the Deep <a href="/octopus-carnival/2024/08/30/lphr-player-characters.htlm">origin</a> don’t make sense as written.</p>

<p>The PC arrives at Kintargo at the start of Adventure 01, which is supposed to
last at least eight weeks or so given the pace at which the “strategic”
rebellion turns move.</p>

<p>However, the aquatic elves that origin is concerned with rescuing are only
captured in the final stretch of Adventure 02. Here’s the timeline as written in
the adventure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The elves arrive in town maybe a week or two before the day of their
capture. This would be in the middle of Adventure 02.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are seeking Shensen’s help with their problems back home. When they fail
to find her, they spend some time exploring the waters around Kintargo before
being captured by the aboleth’s minions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The day of their capture is “fuzzy” - it’s the day before the PCs first enter
the adventure’s final dungeon. Once they do, the GM is supposed to track their
condition over time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The elves might starve before being rescued, and if they’re still alive after
two weeks they’re taken back home to be dominated by the aboleth.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If we take the Knight’s current background as written, it would mean the elves
have been captured <em>before Adventure 01</em>. If we want the PC to have any chance
at all to rescue the elven scouts, we either have to make the Lucky Bones delve
the <em>very first thing</em> the PCs do after the riot, or we have to change the
background.</p>

<p>Doing the former is actually no trouble in Dungeon Fantasy. Starting delvers are
already strong enough to tackle the place, you just might need to put some magic
weapons within easy reach in the first level. If that’s what you want, just have
Laria Longroad point them to the place directly instead of the Wasp Nest.</p>

<p>Since I have already played through the Wasp Nest storyline on my own and I
don’t want to restart the game all the way from the beginning, though, I’m going
to change the background.</p>

<p>Instead of being sent to rescue the scouts, the Knight will be sent in to seek
Shensen’s aid. This gives them a stronger reason to stick with the rebellion,
and a better clue of which path to follow in pursuit of their goals.</p>

<p>The scouts still go to Kintargo in Adventure 02, but this time they do so to
find the Knight, who has been taking much longer than anticipated to return with
Shensen.</p>

<p>Rules-wise, the only thing that changes is that the optional Obsession to find
Aava becomes an Obsession to find Shensen, worth the same number of points.</p>

<p>I’ve also changed the description of the theme in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2024/08/30/lphr-player-characters.htlm">original post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pc-origin-knight-of-the-deep">PC Origin: Knight of the Deep</h2>

<p>You come from one of the subaquatic communities off the coast of Ravounel, where
you enjoy an heroic reputation. You recently went to visit your friend Aava in
the coastal village of Acisazi, only to find the village suffering under a
strange malaise. The village’s elder told you this was caused by a curse that
was beyond her power to break, and begged you to seek the aid of Shensen, a
powerful bard and priest of Sarenrae who lived in the city of Kintargo. You
accepted.</p>

<p>You arrive at this land-lubber town to find it embroiled in a lot more trouble
than you thought possible. Shensen is nowhere to be found. You suspect she
vanished into the prisons of the despotic Barzilai Thrune, and your queries have
led you to the Aria Park protest. You suspect you might need to bloody this
human despot’s nose to fulfill your mission, and that’s just fine with you.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: You must belong to a species capable of breathing underwater!
Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level contains two possible choices here: the Sea
Elf and the Water-Infused. From this blog, you might also pick the [Argonian][2]
or perhaps a <a href="/octopus-carnival/2024/08/30/lphr-player-characters.htlm">Warforged</a> who has been modified to be hydrodynamic and
Amphibious. And of course we also have a whole article about the [Denizens of
the Sea][5] that also contains a few usable ancestries.</p>

<p>This theme is open to any profession, but martial types should probably keep in
mind the rules for [underwater combat for fish-people][3].</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: The people of Acisazi know and trust you, and Aava is your good
friend (or even a relative if you’re also a sea elf).</p>

<p>You can add Swimming, Aquabatics and Survival (Undersea) to your template as
optional skills, and should probably put some points in them during character
creation.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Add Obsession (find Shensen) (12) {-5} to your template as an
optional disadvantage. It’s what you already want to do anyway, but like the
Last Archivist’s Obsession it might drive you to unwise actions.</p>

  <figcaption>
    Ulruun, a bald and beardless dwarf in a fancy tunic. He's smiling
    repugnantly.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’re fresh out of Sorcerer-Kings, but there are still a couple of randos to
read through.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Ulruun used to be a skilled gladiator who managed to survive the arenas of
Nibenay for many years, a rarity. He eventually won his freedom, not for his
victories, but as a reward for murdering someone for his patron.</p>

<p>The dwarf then proceeded to become a living example of the cycle of abuse as he
went on to become a slave auctioneer for House Shom, and to run his own slave
trading operation on the side. The money he earned from both activities made him
wealthy, and finally allowed to achieve the luxurious life of debauchery he so
envied in the people who had forced him to risk his life for entertainment.</p>

<p>His epithet, “the Repugnant”, is not someone people call him to his face, but it
still describes his demeanor very well. He always travels with plenty of
bodyguards in case a competitor or the “merchandise” decides to take a swipe at
him, and has been known to take shelter behind lines of chained prisoners and
other innocents when attacked. If pressed, he can still rely on his arena
skills - that walking stick is mostly for show.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Ulruun is a Level 8 Soldier with 89 HP. As a dwarf, he has a ground speed of 5,
+5 to saves against poison, low-light vision, and the same <strong>Stand the Ground</strong>
and <strong>Steady-Footed</strong> traits PCs get. These reduced forced movement inflicted on
him by 1 and allow him to roll a save to avoid falling prone.</p>

<p>Ulruun’s main weapon is a <strong>Dagger</strong> whose basic attacks damage and mark for a
turn, and which can be used in a <strong>Hamstring</strong> maneuver that deals the same
damage and causes the target to fall prone if they move more than half their
speed before the end of their next turn. If a marked enemy tries to shift away
from him, he can use Hamstring on them as an interrupt.</p>

<p>If his pursuers are too insistent he can surprise them with a <strong>Hurled Cane</strong>
(minor, ranged 5), which targets Reflex and on a hit knocks prone and
immobilizes for a turn. This is an encounter power, as he only has one cane on
him.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Ulruun prefers his obvious bodyguards to be very large and intimidating, so he
tends to recruit goliaths and muls to the role. He also has more discreet humans
and halfling guards hidden in nearby crowds when walking through the city. And
if there are any innocents on the map when a fight breaks out, he’ll use them as
cover as well.</p>

<p>Ulruun is, well, repugnant, though other than being a dwarf there’s probably not
much that’s unique about him. I think he’s meant to be a typical example of a
sleazy slave trader.</p>

        </h1>

  <figcaption>
    Tectuktitlay, dressed in extravagant regalia and holding a human heart.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Tectuktitlay is the king of Draj, and while he is not the only sorcerer-king to
claim to be a god, he’s apparently the one most willing to enforce that claim.</p>

<p>His priests tell the story of how he’s the son of the moons Ral and Guthay, who
descended into the mortal realm already a god. This divine family gave Draj the
gifts of bountiful harvests and prowess in battle, and can easily revoke them
if they’re not properly worshiped.</p>

<p>Disagreeing with Tectuktitlay about any of this is a particularly painful form
of suicide. He constantly appears to his people at the top of his
stepped-pyramid palace (the “Temple of the Father and Master”), and his vigilant
gaze is etched on structures all through Draj. It’s hard to tell whether his
subjects believe he’s really a god - they have gotten extremely good at going
through the motions of worshiping him in the name of self-preservation.</p>

<p>I honestly couldn’t tell from the book’s description if Tectuktitlay really
believes in his own divinity. Whether he does or not, he also knows he’s the
weakest of the Sorcerer Kings, and probably has something of an inferiority
complex about it. He tries to compensate for his personal weakness by making his
realm military strong instead.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three stat blocks here. Draj is the Aztec-themed domain, so everyone here
just loves to rip out people’s hearts.</p>

<h3 id="moon-priest">Moon Priest</h3>

<p>This is a typical templar of Draj, equal parts bureaucrat and enforcer of his
god’s creed. They’re always on the lookout for heresy, and ready to violently
punish it.</p>

<p>Moon Priests are Level 11 Controllers with the Leader tag and 110 HP. Their
leaderly qualities come from their aura of <strong>Enforced Zeal</strong> (1) which gives
allies inside a +2 damage bonus; and from <strong>Blood Demands Blood</strong> an encounter
power that gives allies within 5 squares a +2 attack bonus as a reaction when
the priest is first bloodied.</p>

<p>They fight with a <strong>Scourge</strong> that damages and inflicts a -2 attack penalty for
a turn. They also have a dagger in hand that has a scarier purpose: the <strong>Worthy
Sacrifice</strong> maneuver (melee 1 vs. Reflex), which knocks a target prone on a hit
and lets them make a secondary attack against the same target. If <em>that</em> hits,
it deals heavy physical damage, dazes (save ends), and gives 10 temporary HP to
each nonminion ally the priest can see. They try to rip your heart out! And this
is at-will.</p>

<p>They can use a minor action to charm an enemy with a <strong>Sacrificial
Summons</strong> (ranged 15 vs. Will) which pulls 5 squares and makes the target grant
combat advantage for a turn. If this ends up with the target in melee reach,
it’s that much easier to hit them with the big sacrifice attack.</p>

<h3 id="jasuan-temple-guard">Jasuan Temple Guard</h3>

<p>These are elite bodyguards hand-picked from Draj’s knightly orders for their
unquestioning devotion to their god. They protect the Father and Master Temple,
and Tectuktitlay himself. They’re Level 21 Soldiers with 200 HP.</p>

<p>They fight with <strong>Obsidian Broadswords</strong> that deal immediate and ongoing
physical damage, and also mark (save ends both). And they can throw <strong>Bone
Harpoons</strong> that deal physical damage and immobilize (save ends). Once a target
has been immobilized, they can be targeted by <strong>Reel In</strong> (minor, ranged 10
vs. Fort), which pulls them 5 squares or knocks them prone on a hit. If they end
up adjacent to the guard, the guard can hit them with his sword again.</p>

<p>Finally, their <strong>Wicked Cruelty</strong> gives them 10 temporary HP whenever they
bloody an enemy for the first time, and it’s the first time that enemy has been
bloodied in the fight.</p>

<h3 id="tectuktitlay-sorcerer-king">Tectuktitlay, Sorcerer-King</h3>

<p>Tectuktitlay is Level 22 Elite Artillery (Leader), lower level than any other of
the sorcerer-kings we saw so far in this book. He has 316 HP and a speed of 6.</p>

<p>Tectuktitlay projects a large aura of <strong>Imposed Zealotry</strong> (4) that gives a +2
attack bonus to allies inside, and another one of <strong>Bloody Vigor</strong> over the same
area that heals 10 HP to any bloodied ally that starts their turn inside.</p>

<p>He has a <strong>dagger</strong> for melee, but the real star of the show here are his
spells, all of which have a maximum range of 20. <strong>Arrows of the Two Moons</strong>
deals necrotic + radiant damage, the most unexpected combination I’ve ever
seen. <strong>Spear of the Sky</strong> is a selective area attack that deals fire +
lightning damage, and <strong>Double Attack</strong> lets him use both spells in the same
action.</p>

<p><strong>Kiss of the Two Moons</strong> is his limited-use special, firing off two separate
bolts at different targets. The first does necrotic damage and weakens (save
ends); the second does radiant damage and blinds (save ends). A miss on either
attack deals half damage and inflicts the associated condition for a turn. This
recharges when he’s first bloodied.</p>

<p>Last but not least there’s <strong>Thief of Hearts</strong> (vs. Fort, recharge 5+), in which
he attempts to teleport someone’s heart to his hand. A hit deals damage equal to
the target’s healing surge value, and hit or miss the target is dazed (save
ends).</p>

<p>If Tectuktitlay is hit with a melee or ranged attack, he can order an
<strong>Involuntary Sacrifice</strong> as an interrupt, choosing an ally within 4
squares. That ally shifts to be adjacent to his master, and is hit by the attack
instead of him.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Tectuktitlay wants to stay 20 squares away from the PCs and bombard them with
spells. His at-wills are annoying enough, but what will really light a fire
under the PCs to end him as soon as possible is when Thief of Hearts lands for
the first time. I initially read it as dealing damage equal to the target’s
<em>bloodied</em> value, but even if the actual damage is just half that, the
psychological impact is still high.</p>

<p>The party will want to get into melee with him as soon as possible, as he has no
protection against opportunity attacks, but that will be made harder by the
small army of jasuan guards and maybe up-leveled priests that will also be
there. They’ll get in the way, and their king can pull them in to take hits in
his stead.</p>

<p>The next best thing is to inflict dazes or stuns on him, since he lacks
protection against those aside from the usual elite save bonus.</p>

    Nibenay, in his true half-draconic form, lounging on his throne.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Yes, he named his city after himself.</p>

<p>Nibenay seems to be a very academically-minded Sorcerer-King, which is evident
in how his transformation seems to be the furthest along among the living ones,
but he’s also kinda lazy. For about two thousand years now, he’s been holed up
in his palace-temple complex of Naggaramakam enjoying a life of luxury and study
while his priesthood took care of all those boring “running the kingdom” tasks.</p>

<p>His priesthood are also his templars, which are all women and all his wives. So
this might explain why Dregoth outpaced him 1700 years ago - Nibenay still has
his vices.</p>

<p>Nibebay’s highest ranking templars are known as the High Consorts. There are
five of them, each in charge of one of the city-state’s temples. The Shadow
King’s inner circle is composed of these five, plus his personal arcane
assistants, his half-monster son Dhojakt, and a group of elite goliath
warriors. Only they can enter Naggaramakam and interact directly with their
king. And only they know what Nibenay’s true draconic form looks like - he
disguises himself as a human in his rare public appearances.</p>

<p>Things might have continued this way forever if it wasn’t for Kalak’s
assassination and the liberation of Tyr. This kind of lit a fire under Nibenay,
and he decided to end his isolation and take a more active hand in the ruling of
his domain. This has nearly all Nibenese nobles and a large number of
lower-ranking templars in a panic because they’ve been up to a lot of
self-enriching shenanigans that they were sure their king would never notice or
care about. There’s a lot of unpleasant purges in the city’s immediate future.</p>

<p>Still, Nibenay hasn’t completely abandoned his research. He seems to be
particularly interested in Athas’ distant past, and is rumored to be looking for
a way to “bring about a new Age”. That probably involves some sort of
large-scale environmental engineering, though it’s unlikely to be beneficial to
the inhabitants.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three different stat blocks here, which we’ll see in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="shadow-bride">Shadow Bride</h3>

<p>This is one of Nibenay’s lower-ranking templars. The city’s nobles tend to look
down on them and use them as pawns in their own schemes - the name “Shadow
Bride” is something of an insult. The brides resent them for this, and do
whatever dirty deeds they need in order to claw some wealth and influence for
themselves and climb the ranks of their organization.</p>

<p>This Shadow Bride is a Level 13 Soldier with 130 HP and Speed 6. She fights with
an <strong>Obsidian Short Sword</strong> in melee, and with <strong>Shadow Bolts</strong> at range that do
light cold+necrotic damage. She can inflict the <strong>Curse of the Shadow King</strong> an
adjacent enemy with a minor action. This marks the enemy until the end of the
encounter and makes it grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<p>Marked enemies within 6 squares who decide to ignore the mark can be targeted
with <strong>Nibenay’s Retribution</strong> as an interrupt - the bride teleports to a square
adjacent to the enemy and makes a very accurate attack vs. their Fortitude,
dealing fire+necrotic damage on a hit.</p>

<p>In her own turns the bride can also <strong>Demand Penitence</strong> (recharge 5+),
targetting up to two marked enemies in a Close Burst 5, dealing psychic damage,
pulling them 4 squares, and knocking them prone.</p>

<p>Yup, this is a Soldier Warlock. Not a combination you see every day. The
“eldritch blast” equivalent here is distinctly secondary. She wants to bring
enemies into melee range and keep them there.</p>

<h3 id="high-consort">High Consort</h3>

<p>One of the five highest ranked priestess-wives of Nibenay, part of his inner
circle. Just like the city’s nobles, they jockey for position amongst
themselves, constantly engaging in backstabbing and intrigue, though they <em>are</em>
loyal to their hubby and will fight at his side against meddling PCs who manage
to get that far. They will also fight to the end to protect their own
temples. In any other situation, they run away when the fight turns against
them.</p>

<p>High Consorts are Level 27 Artillery with 192 HP, Speed 6 and Low-Light
Vision. They fight with <strong>Obsidian Spears</strong> in melee and with <strong>Shadow Blasts</strong>
at range 20. These deal cold+necrotic damage.</p>

<p>Their special spell is <strong>Cage of Shadows</strong> (ranged 10), which deals heavy force
damage and immobilizes (save ends). It recharges when they’re bloodied. They can
also practice <strong>Arcane Defiling</strong> whenever they miss with this power or with a
Shadow Blast while allies are present within 2 squares of them. This is a free
action that inflicts 10 necrotic damage on each such ally, and lets the consort
reroll the attack.</p>

<p>If they get surrounded, consorts can use <strong>Nibenay’s Gift</strong> (recharge 5+) as a
minor action, dealing 15 cold+necrotic damage to each adjacent enemy,
teleporting 6 squares, and gaining concealment for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="nibenay-sorcerer-king">Nibenay, Sorcerer-King</h3>

<p>Nibenay in his true form is a Large Natural Humanoid, and a Level 29 Elite
Controller with 532 HP. He has ground and teleport speeds of 6 and Darkvision.</p>

<p>His <strong>Sorcerer King’s Guile</strong> is going to ruin the day of many a PC fighter, as
it makes him not provoke opportunity attacks from making ranged and area
attacks.</p>

<p>In melee, he fights with Reach 2 <strong>Dragon’s Talons</strong>, which damage and restrain
(save ends). At range, he uses the classic <strong>Ego Whip</strong> (range 10), which deals
psychic damage and dazes (save ends). Yes, it’s at-will, and <strong>Ego Storm</strong> lets
him use it twice in the same action.</p>

<p>Less often, he can use <strong>Defiling Burst</strong> (recharge 5+), which automatically
deals 15 necrotic damage to each adjacent enemy and lets Nibenay attack an Area
Burst 2 within 10 to deal necrotic damage.</p>

<p>The text is a bit strange here, as it says Nibenay gains +1 to the burst’s
attack roll for each enemy damaged by it. I guess you roll once, count the hits,
add the bonus, and keep repeating the last two steps until he either runs out of
targets or misses someone.</p>

<p>As a minor action he can creaze a <strong>Zone of Shadows</strong> that lasts for a turn and
blocks line of sight for everyone except himself. Enemies inside are
blinded. The power recharges when the zone vanishes.</p>

<p>His version of <strong>Arcane Defiling</strong> triggers when he hits and deals damage with
either of his basic attacks. It inflicts 10 necrotic damage on each enemy within
2 squares and weakens the target of the triggering attack for a turn. It’s a
<em>free action</em>, not a reaction or interrupt, so this happens every single time he
hits with Dragon Talon or Ego Whip.</p>

<p><strong>Nibenay’s Demand</strong> is his anti-stunlock power, a reaction that lets him
inflict 10 necrotic damage on an enemy within 5 squares and roll a save whenever
he’s subject to an effect a save can end.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Nibenay being an Elite instead of a Solo is not necessarily a sign that he’s
weak, but that the final fight against him will be a crowded affair. Any
surviving high consorts will surely be here, as will any other epic level
assistants and guards the GM wants to add to make the battle a worthy challenge.</p>

<p>Unlike Andropinis, Nibenay doesn’t have powers that boost or benefit from his
allies, but at least he doesn’t get in their way either - his area attack is
selective. The High Consorts, however, <em>are</em> likely to step on each others’ toes
because their version of Arcane Defiling targets allies instead of enemies.</p>
