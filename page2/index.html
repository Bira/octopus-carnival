    her kingdom.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Lalali-Puy is the Sorcerer-Queen of Gulg, which is possibly the greenest
city-state in Athas. Out of all the Sorcerer-Kings, she’s also the most
personally beloved by her subjects, who call her Oba or Forest Goddess.</p>

<p>She uses her magic to bring rain to Gulg, and to protect it from threats both
external and internal. She also owns everything in Gulg, and is responsible for
seeing to its even distribution among the dagadas (communities) in which its
people live. If you’re a citizen of Gulg, everything you wear and eat, all the
livestock you tend and the land it grazes on, all belongs to Oba, who graciously
allows you to use it.</p>

<p>Of course, being a Sorcerer-Queen, Lalali-Puy has further dark secrets unknown
to common citizens. The description of her capabilities above might read as
“epic druid” to someone familiar with standard D&amp;D, but that’s a lie. The reason
she has so much power over her kingdom is because she keeps its primal spirits
enslaved through arcane magic. And the spirits hate her for it. Given the
smallest opportunity, they’d devastate Gulg’s dagadas in revenge.</p>

<p>Despite her villainy, Lalali-Puy is described as the most accomplished ritualist
on Athas. Many of the arcane and primal rituals on her extensive library are
unknown to even the other Sorcerer-Kings. PCs might find themselves having to
ally with her in exchange for a specific ritual… or plotting a heist to steal
it from her vaults.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We’ll take a look at some of Lalali-Puy’s servants here, and then at the
Sorcerer Queen herself.</p>

<h3 id="nganga">Nganga</h3>

<p>This is one of Lalali-Puy’s templars, known as ngangas (witch doctors). When a
citizen is selected for nganga training, they’re completely removed and isolated
from society. From that point on, they only appear in public wearing scary
demonic masks enchanted with fear powers.</p>

<p>The nganga we have here is clearly some sort of human warlock pacted to their
Queen. They’re Level 11 Artillery with 90 HP and Speed 6. They fight in melee by
bonking people with a <strong>spirit rattle</strong> that also serves as their
implement. Their basic ranged attack is a <strong>Ghost Lance</strong> (ranged 20
vs. Fortitude) that deals necrotic damage. They can also use <strong>Spectral Jaws</strong>
(Range 12 vs. AC) that deal force damage and immobilize (save ends).</p>

<p>The fear enchantment on the <strong>Devil Mask</strong> serves as a good keep-away power:
Close Blast 3 vs. Will, deals psychic damage and pushes 3 squares. At the start
of the target’s subsequent turns, the nganga can choose to push them 3 squares
(save ends).</p>

<p>Finally, they can curse someone with a minor action with <strong>Curse of the
Oba</strong>. The curse lasts until the end of the encounter, and they can keep cursing
multiple people. They also really want to do that, because when the nganga deals
damage to someone other than the cursed victim, the victim takes the same amount
of damage. If the PCs aren’t quick to deal with the nganga, they’ll soon find
their whole party being “focus-fired” at once.</p>

<h3 id="judaga">Judaga</h3>

<p>Judagas are the most elite warriors in Gulg. Like ngangas, they’re mostly
isolated from society, though instead of masks they wear special enchanted
leopard pelts preserved from the Green Age. Lalali-Puy has a honor guard of
judagas with her at all times, and they can also be seen moving among the
populace when she or the ngangas feel physical threats entering Gulg.</p>

<p>The example judaga here is a human, and a Level 25 Skirmisher with 231 HP. Their
speed is the usual 6, but they also have Forest Walk and a +2 to saves against
Charm and Fear effects.</p>

<p>Judagas fight with <strong>scimitars</strong> that do level-appropriate damage, and their
<strong>Leopard’s Fury</strong> maneuver lets them shift 6 squares and perform a special
attack at any point along the movement. This does a bit less damage than the
basic strike but also inflicts 15 ongoing damage (save ends) and pushes 2
squares.</p>

<p>Lastly, if the judaga happens to be within 6 squares of Lalali-Puy herself
(meaning they’re acting as a bodyguard) they can shift as a minor action.</p>

<p>The book explicitly calls judagas out as willing to perform a coup-de-grace on a
downed PC in the middle of a fight, which makes them a lot more dangerous than
their short list of abilities indicates.</p>

<h3 id="lalali-puy-sorcerer-queen">Lalali-Puy, Sorcerer-Queen</h3>

<p>The Oba herself is a human, and a Level 28 Solo Controller with 1032 HP and the
Leader tag. She has a ground speed of 6 and a teleport speed of 3.</p>

<p>Lalali-Puy is surrounded by <strong>Ravenous Ghosts</strong> (aura 5) that give a damage
boost to the melee attacks of any allies within the aura. Her <strong>Oba’s Ambition</strong>
makes her regain one of her 2 solo action points whenever an enemy cursed by her
drops to 0 HP.</p>

<p>As that description indicates, Lalali-Puy fights like a warlock. In a way, she’s
a “role model” for an epic-level warlock - someone who has long surpassed
whatever entity taught her magic in the first place, and who now makes pacts
with others to teach <em>them</em> magic in exchange for service.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with the curse-related powers, because those are the core of her
tactics. She can use <strong>Oba’s Curse</strong> once per turn as a minor action. This is
exactly the same curse the ngangas can use, the one that mirrors melee or ranged
damage inflicted on other enemies to the cursed victims. However, it’s (save
ends) instead of lasting the whole encounter, because Lalali-Puy’s attacks are
much stronger. Still, a string of bad save rolls could still have her “focusing
down” the whole party a once.</p>

<p><strong>Oba’s Vengeance</strong> makes that a scenario a certainty when the PCs manage to
bloody her: this is a Close Burst <em>15</em> attack that affects enemies, deals
necrotic+psychic damage, and stuns for a turn on a hit. It also curses every
target <em>as an effect</em> (save ends).</p>

<p><strong>Oba’s Blessing</strong> is a free action power that lets Lalali-Puy remove her curse
from a victim to end an effect on her or on an ally within 20 squares, so here’s
her stunlock protection.</p>

<p>Keep that damage mirroring effect in mind as we look at her “normal”
attacks. All of them have additional things they do to curse victims.</p>

<p><strong>Repelling Touch</strong> is the melee basic attack. It deals force damage, pushes the
target 5 squares, and then pushes all other enemies cursed by her 2 squares as
an effect. <strong>Spirit Maw</strong> is the ranged basic attack. It deals force damage,
slides 4 squares, and slides every other cursed enemy 2 squares as an effect.</p>

<p><strong>Spirit Gale</strong> is a fireball-like attack (Area Burst 2 within 15). It targets
Will, deals necrotic+psychic damage, and immobilizes (save ends). This
downgrades to “half damage and slowed for a turn” on a hit, but as an <em>effect</em>,
it lets her slow one cursed enemy she can see (save ends). The first failed save
from that enemy makes them <em>stunned</em> (save ends).</p>

<p>Her one power without any curse bonuses is <strong>Oba’s Punishment</strong> a reaction that
triggers when she’s hit by an attack from an enemy within 15 squares. It’s a
counterattack that deals psychic damage and teleports the target 10 squares on a
hit. Since this is written as a Close Burst, it doesn’t benefit from damage
mirroring, but it will still trigger pretty often.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I love Lalali-Puy’s mechanics. If the PCs end up fighting her, she will have an
honor guard of judagas with her to use as distractions, all of which probably
benefit from Ravenous Ghosts. And then she’ll curse as many people as she can
and focus her single-target attacks on the weakest of them.</p>

  <figcaption>
    Jossi the Juggler, juggling
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Jossi gets a mention in the description of the city of Tyr in the Campaign
Setting book, and a full writeup here. She’s a member of Tyr’s Eyes, which was
originally a group of beggars, street performers and thieves who banded together
for mutual support. Nowadays they also act as a kind of freelance spy agency,
keeping an eye on what goes on in the city both to improve their own chances of
survival and to sell the juiciest gossip to whoever has the money to pay for it.</p>

<p>Jossi is known as a street performer, doing a pretty impressive routine on the
markets of Tyr. She supplements her income with theft and information
broketing. I think both books’ emphasis on her might mean they intend Jossi to
be the PC’s first point of contact with Tyr’s Eyes during your typical campaign.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Jossi is an elf, though her speed is only 6 and they forgot to add her low-light
vision. After so many sorcerer-kings, it’s interesting to find a plain old Level
4 Skirmisher with 55 HP in the Personages of Athas section.</p>

<p>She fights with the same <strong>Daggers</strong> she uses in her juggling act, and her
<strong>Juggling Slash</strong> technique lets her target Reflex instead of AC, deal the same
damage as a basic attack, slide the target 2 squares, and shift 2 squares. This
is <em>at-will</em>, making her very annoying to fight. On any turn where Jossi shifts
as a move action, she also gains a bit of bonus damage courtesy of her <strong>Fancy
Footwork</strong>.</p>

<p>As soon as she realizes the odds are against her, Jossi will try to
escape. <strong>Distracting Toss</strong> helps with this: when someone makes a melee attack
against her, the can shift her speed as a reaction to reach any square on the
map that has any amount of cover or concealment, and then make a Stealth test
with a +5 bonus (total +16) to become hidden.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Mildly interesting, I guess. Jossi is clearly more on the “possible ally” than
on the “enemy” side of the balance, so unless the PCs go out of their way to be
assholes or to antagonize Tyr’s Eyes, they won’t be fighting her. If that ends
up happening, though, Jossi will not be alone. You should assemble a team of the
many “low-Heroic street scum” stat blocks available here and in other books to
act as the fellow Eyes members who come to her aid.</p>

<p>It could be interesting to have Jossi as an active ally in one or more fights,
using these stats. Juggling Slash has hilarious synergy with what PC rogues can
do, and Distracting Toss is a good way to quickly leave the fight in case her HP
starts to run low.</p>

    Haneth Tsalaxa
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>If you’re following the RPG.net thread with the Campaign Guide reading, you will
already have seen a description of House Tsalaxa on <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/wir-4e-dark-sun-campaign-guide.925494/post-25647852">this post</a>. They’re one
of the dodgier merchant houses with a presence in Tyr.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>House Tsalaxa: Based in Draj and known for blackmail and spycraft, trades in
rope, grain, and previously owned cargo. Emblem: two glaring, bestial eyes.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Haneth Tsalaxa is the head of their Tyr branch, and he has a very unpleasant
reputation amongst his neighbors. He apparently has tons of dirt on everyone in
the city. Most of his fortune comes from blackmail and information brokering. If
you see him darkening your doorstep, prepare for an unpleasant conversation.</p>

<p>The secret of his success, which no one but him knows, is that he has a natural
ability to change his shape. He has no idea <em>why</em>: changelings are apparently
unheard-of in Athas, making him possibly the only one. He does exploit this
power as much as he can, disguising himself to better infiltrate private places
and overhear all sorts of interesting gossip. In addition to blackmail, he’s
also willing to do espionage and assassination for hire, though his prices are
ridiculously high.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Haneth is either a 4e changeling or mechanically indistinguishable from one:
he’s a Medium Natural Humanoid with the Shapechanger and Changeling tags, and a
Level 9 Elite Lurker with 154 HP.</p>

<p>He fights with a <strong>Short Sword</strong> that deals standard physical damage and
inflicts ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends) if he has combat advantage, and can
also throw <strong>Daggers</strong> that target Reflex and deal decent damage. His <strong>Slick
Swordplay</strong> lets him make 2 sword attacks and shift 3 squares before, between,
or after them.</p>

<p>He’s improved upon the classic “pocket sand” technique and can throw a <strong>Handful
of Poison</strong> (recharge 5+) in a close blast 3, dealing poison damage and blinding
on a hit (save ends).</p>

<p>He also has a couple of classic changeling minor actions: <strong>Changeling
Disguise</strong> lets him change chape to appear like any Medium humanoid. His
clothing and equipment remain the same, so it might be a bit hard to use in
combat, but it does help a lot when assembling a disguise. He can copy specific
individuals, but only if he’s seen them before. <strong>Haneth’s Trick</strong> (recharge 6+)
can make one enemy automatically grant combat advantage to him for a turn.</p>

<p>There is no DC to pierce the Changeling Disguise. Presumably you can use the
default rules and roll a contest of his Bluff of +12 against the Insight of any
investigators.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Haneth’s ability spread makes him more of a skirmisher with reduced AC and HP
than a proper lurker. The ongoing poison damage from combat advantage is better
than nothing, but be lacks something like a Sneak Attack or a really strong
ambush power.</p>

<p>Good thing he always has plenty of bodyguards around whenever he’s not in
disguise. He’s a major employer of unscrupulous Mixed Groups of People. Gotta
spend money to make money.</p>

  <figcaption>
    Hamanu posing for the cover of a business magazine.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Hamanu is the Sorcerer-King of Urik. He looks like a big strong man, and is
known to be deeply invested in the success of his city-state. He spends the days
governing it and training with his soldiers, and the nights deep in arcane study
since he no longer has any need for sleep. For Hamanu is the Sorcerer-King who
most genuinely cares about his state and its people.</p>

<p>I’m sure there are some tech billionaires in today’s real world that would read
the above paragraph and think “this guy is goals”. And they would not change
their opinions if they learned that he’s also the most totalitarian of the
Sorcerer-Kings as well. The price for his “love” is constant supervision and
total submission.</p>

<p>Despite being a very classically-trained wizard, Hamanu loves physical combat
and is quite good at punching people to death. He’s managing his gradual
draconic transformation so that the signs remain subtle for as long as possible,
so most of the time they consist of golden eyes and slightly long teeth. When
wounded in combat, however, be transforms into a big lion-dragon-thing.</p>

<p>Urik templars live spartan lives, but do get to enjoy the perks of their
station, chief among which is the right to push the common people around.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get stats for Hamanu and for a typical templar.</p>

<h3 id="toil-templar">Toil Templar</h3>

<p>Unlike the templars we saw in previous entries, this isn’t a high-ranking
officer who spends their days next to their king’s throne. Instead, this one is
drawn from the <em>lowest</em> ranks of Urik’s templars, the one responsible for
managing its enslaved population. It’s a Level 14 Controller with 133 HP,
meaning the PCs are likely to tussle with them long before they ever come
face-to-face with Hamanu himself.</p>

<p>Toil Templars are armed with a whip and a rod, which is very thematic. The
<strong>whip</strong> is Reach 2 and its attacks damage and push the target 2 squares on a
hit. The rod is used as an implement for their spells: <strong>Eldritch Scourge</strong>
(ranged 5) deals force damage and knocks prone; <strong>Dazing Bolts</strong> (encounter,
ranged 10) deals lightning damage and dazes for a turn; and <strong>Sulfurous
Detonation</strong> (encounter; area 2 within 10) is a fancy name for a fireball that
leaves a stinky zone lasting a turn and dealing 5 poison damage to any enemy who
ends their turn inside.</p>

<h3 id="hamanu-sorcerer-king">Hamanu, Sorcerer-King</h3>

<p>The man himself is a Level 27 Solo Controller with 693 HP, Speed 6, and
Darkvision. He exhudes a <strong>Regal Presence</strong> (aura 2) which inflicts a -2 attack
penalty on any enemy who starts their turn inside. This lasts until the start of
the enemy’s next turn, so it remains for that long even when they leave the
aura.</p>

<p>Hamanu’s basic melee attack is done with his <strong>Mighty Fists</strong>, whose 6d6+14
damage is the envy of every 2e and 3e monk but is typical for a creature of his
level.</p>

<p>He also has a big selection of “classic”-feeling spells. <strong>Thunderous Command</strong>
is an at-will close blast 5 that deals thunder damage, pushes 3 squares, and
knocks prone. The next three are all big blasty encounter spells:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sulfuric Bolts</strong> (ranged 5) targets up to 5 enemies, deals fire damage, and
inflicts ongoing 10 fire+acid damage (save ends). Until the target saves,
any of the target’s allies that ends their turn next to it takes 10
acid+poison damage. Stinky!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Life Drain</strong> (close burst 5, enemies only) deals necrotic damage and
inflicts ongoing 15 necrotic damage. Every time a target takes that damage,
Hamanu gains 15 temp HP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hamanu’s Whisper</strong> (area 2 within 10, the fireball template) is an
“acidball” that deals immediate and ongoing acid damage (save ends). It leaves
a zone behind that inflicts a -4 penalty to saves on any enemy inside. This
lasts for a turn but Hamanu can sustain it with minor actions and move it
around with move actions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As a minor action he can use an <strong>Invasive Glare</strong> (ranged 5) that deals heavy
psychic damage and stuns (save ends). This recharges whenever Hamanu bloodies an
enemy or reduces an enemy to 0 HP.</p>

<p>If an adjacent enemy targets him with a melee attack, Hamanu can interpose a
<strong>Cerulean Shield</strong> spell as an interrupt, gaining 15 temporary HP just before
the attack is rolled. If someone manages to daze or stun him, he can use
<strong>Mental Fortress</strong> as an interrupt to roll an immediate save against the
effect, even if it would not normally allow one. On a success, the triggering
enemy takes 15 psychic damage and the effect never happens.</p>

<p>When bloodied, <strong>Lion of the Desert</strong> automatically triggers with no action
required. This pushes every enemy in a close burst 2 squares, and attacks their
Fortitude to knock them prone on a hit. And then Hamanu turns into the eponymous
beast, which is going to be a nice surprise to any PCs who thought he had spent
all of his tricks already. The Lion has its own stat block, below.</p>

<p>When the Lion form is reduced to 0 HP, Hamanu returns to his human form with the
same HP he had when he transformed into the Lion. When he reaches 0 HP, he uses
Lion of the Desert <em>again</em>, one last time.</p>

<h3 id="lion-of-the-desert">Lion of the Desert</h3>

<p>Hamanu’s beast-form is a big lion-dragon hybrid, probably created by hiding all
of his ugliest draconic mutations in one metaphysical place. It’s a Level 27
Solo Brute with only 125 HP because it’s a stage in the bigger fight against
Hamanu and not something that can appear independently. On the bright side, it
<em>cannot become bloodied</em>, even when reduced below half HP. It has a Speed of 8,
and retains Darkvision.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Claw</strong> that deals heavy physical damage, and
<strong>Double Claw</strong> lets him use it twice against different targets. It can also use
a Reach 2 <strong>Corrosive Bite</strong> that deals a little less damage but inflicts
ongoing 15 acid damage (save ends). <strong>Lion’s Fury</strong> is an encounter power that
lets him pull off an old-school claw/claw/bite attack sequence.</p>

<p>If an enemy misses the Lion with a melee attack, its <strong>Warding Tail</strong> slams them
as a reaction, damaging and pushing them 3 squares on a hit.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>As a character, Hamanu seems to be what you get when you leave most of your
settings at default, the very first picture that comes into your mind when you
read the general description of what a Sorcerer-King is. The surprises only
start when it’s time to actually fight him, because “muscle wizard” is probably
not the very first thing that comes to your mind, and neither is “lion-dragon
monster”.</p>

<p>In a fight, Hamanu will likely want to alpha strike as soon as possible, using
Hamanu’s Whisper and Sulfuric Bolts as soon as enough targets are in range and
then wading in to catch people in his aura and let them catch his hands. He will
sustain the zone from Hamanu’s Whisper and then use Invasive Glare on the PCs
that are inside it, too. Cerulean Shield and Mental Fortress give him plenty of
extra durability for these tactics. As he approaches his bloodied value, make
him look like he’s on the ropes and out of tricks, and then spring the Lion on
the PCs.</p>

<p>The book doesn’t specify whether the uses of Hamanu’s many encounter powers
should be tracked across his transformations. I’m guessing that the human form’s
spells <em>should</em> be, but Lion’s Fury should <em>not</em>, meaning it will be ready for a
second use when he transforms again.</p>

<p>In our narrative present, everyone in Athas believes the Dragon of Tyr is the
only dragon on the planet. Even the Dragon himself.</p>

<p>But there is one other.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Every Sorcerer-King wants to ascend in the same way their buddy Borys did, but
for some of them that feels more like a side project. They all have other things
going on, lands to rule, vices to indulge. Dregoth, on the other hand, made “I
shall become a god!” his whole personality. While they partied, he studied
defiling magic.</p>

<p>Dregoth completed his draconic transformation ahead of everyone else except
Borys (who had help!). He created a whole new species in his image (the dray),
and was in the process of perfecting their design and teaching them to worship
him when Abalach-Re decided to see what he was up to and became terrified.</p>

<p>She warned the others, and they banded together to eliminate the threat because
the community of Sorcerer-Kings works exactly like a bucket of crabs. The
ensuing battle was titanic. Dregoth was slain, and his city of Giustenal was
shattered, scattering the survivors and flooding the spirit world with the souls
of the dead (many of whom haunt the ruins).</p>

<p>And then Dregoth got better. He returned in secret as an <em>undead</em> dragon,
setting up in a giant cavern far beneath the surface and calling his surviving
loyalists there. Every inhabitant of this New Giustenal is required to undergo
transformation into a dray, if they weren’t one already.</p>

<p>The plan remains the same: gather enough worshippers to undergo apotheosis and
become a real god. By now, centuries after his death, Dregoth has a sizable army
of dray, undead, and other creatures under his command. Real Soon Now (TM), he’s
going to invade the surface to get revenge on his former “buddies” and gather
all the worship he needs to finally complete his unlife’s work.</p>

<p>Dregoth’s undeath works like that of a lich. His soul is hidden in an artifact
somewhere in New Giustenal, and if he’s killed he will reform next to that
artifact within three days. The only other person who knows this is Absalom, his
high priest. Absalom used to be human, and was one of the first of Dregoth’s
subjects to be transformed into a dray after Giustenal’s fall. Dregoth then
killed him and raised him as a unique undead being, which explains why he’s
still around.</p>

<p>Absalom is a competent high priest, but his true loyalty is to the dragonborn of
New Giustenal. Should he ever have to choose, that’s whom he’ll pick. Canny
epic-tier PCs might be able to discover this.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As usual, let’s see them in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="absalom">Absalom</h3>

<p>The high priest is a Medium Natural Humanoid with then Shapechanger, Undead, and
Dragonborn tags. He’s a Level 22 Elite Soldier with 414 HP, Speed 8, and
Darkvision. Like many undead, he’s immune to disease and poison, and has 15
Resistance to both fire and necrotic damage.</p>

<p>His main weapon is an ancient <strong>Bastard Sword</strong> that’s probably made of
metal. Its blows do light damage for his level but inflict ongoing 10 damage
(save ends). <strong>Slicing Maneuvers</strong> lets him attack twice and make his move
action between these attacks. At range he can use <strong>Spirit Siphon</strong> (range 20,
recharge 4+) to inflict <em>45</em> ongoing cold+necrotic damage (save ends both). Each
time an enemy takes damage from the power, Absalom or a nearby ally gain 10
temporary HP.</p>

<p>Instead of running like a pleb, Absalom can use <strong>Dread Wings</strong> as a move action
to teleport 8 squares and gain a flight speed equal to his speed for a
turn. This is at-will, so it can be the movement he does between Slicing
Maneuvers.</p>

<p>His soldierly skills live in his minor and triggered actions. <strong>Overshadowing
Oath</strong> marks a visible enemy within 20 squares for a turn, and can be used
multiple times per round. If a marked enemy ends their turn in a square that’s
not adjacent to Absalom, they take 20 damage as a reaction and grant combat
advantage for a turn. This means the high priest wants to stay away from marked
enemies, generally.</p>

<p>Other minor actions include <strong>Swirling Breath</strong> (recharge 6+), which does a
blend of necrotic and fire damage, and slides 3 squares on a hit; and <strong>Change
Shape</strong>, which lets him shift between his natural undead form, a disguise as a
living dragonborn, or a specific individual he’s seen. Equipment and clothes
don’t change. The DC to pierce the disguises is 41, though I imagine it would be
lower if he turns into a specific individual without changing out of his robes.</p>

<p>Absalom is a strong melee combatant, but he’s much better as a ranged
nuisance. Mark someone at the limit of his Oath’s range and then stay away from
them while attacking with Soul Siphon. When someone gets close, use Slicing
Maneuvers to stab them, and teleport to a distant squishy to stab <em>them</em> too.</p>

<h3 id="dregoth-sorcerer-king">Dregoth, Sorcerer-King</h3>

<p>The scale of that illustration is a bit misleading: Dregoth is a Huge Natural
Magical Beast with the Undead and Shapechanger tags. Interestingly enough he
doesn’t have the Dragon tag, so maybe he isn’t quite done with his
transformation yet. It could also be an oversight, as he has pretty much
everything he’d need to be a dragon in his stat block.</p>

<p>Dregoth is a Level 30 Solo Controller with 1072 HP. His ground speed is 8, his
flight speed is 10, he’s immune to disease and poison and has 20 resistance to
both fire and necrotic damage. His special senses include darkvision and
Blindsight 5.</p>

<p>He projects a <strong>Soul Defiler</strong> aura with a radius of 3, which is a lot given
he’s Huge. Whenever an enemy starts their turn inside, they take 10 damage and
Dregoth gets to roll a save if he needs one.</p>

<p>He has a reach 2 <strong>bite</strong> that damages and inflicts ongoing 10 necrotic (save
ends), and a reach 3 <strong>claw</strong> that does the same and also slows. He can attack
at range 20 with a <strong>Defiling Gaze</strong> that deals necrotic damage and dazes (save
ends). <strong>Dread King’s Wrath</strong> lets him do a bite/claw or claw/claw combo, though
the fact that it has both “ranged” and “melee” icons next to it seems to
indicate he could replace one of those attacks with a Gaze too. I wonder which
version (melee only or melee and ranged) is the right one.</p>

<p>Anyway, his <strong>Breath Weapon</strong> (encounter) is a close blast 5 that deals a blend
of cold and necrotic damage, immobilizes, and inflicts a -4 penalty to AC and
Fortitude (save ends both). <strong>Supreme Defiling</strong> (encounter) covers a Close
Burst 3, deals heavy untyped damage, and crits on a 17-20.</p>

<p>As a move action, he can use <strong>Nightmare Travel</strong> (encounter) to become
insubstantial and phasing, and shift 8 squares. If he passes through a
creature’s space during this movement, the creature takes 15 psychic damage and
is knocked prone.</p>

<p>So many encounter powers, that means he becomes a lot less dangerous once
they’re all used up, right? No, because he can use <strong>Spellmaster</strong> (recharge 5+)
as a minor action to recover any of them. He can also <strong>Change Shape</strong> to appear
as a Medium dragonborn, or as a specific individual he’s seen before. The DC for
seeing through such a disguise is 47.</p>

<p>When Dregoth is hit by an attacker within 4 squares he can use a <strong>Tail
Riposte</strong> as a reaction. This does some damage, inflicts 15 fire+necrotic
damage, and slides the target 5 squares.</p>

<p>Being in melee with Dregoth is <em>extremely dangerous</em>, because it puts you within
easy reach of nearly all of his attacks. Plus the more PCs are inside his aura,
the better he is at shrugging off negative conditions. Trying to snipe him from
a distance works better, but he’s very mobile and his gaze attack can make it
hard to maintain that distance. And if he has any idea at all that the PCs are
coming for him, he’ll be smart enough to pick a battlefield that forces them to
stay close.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like that Absalom is a unique undead being that you can’t easily slot into any
classification. Dregoth is technically one too, though the individual components
of his schtick are more familiar. He is a dragon who is a lich, but he’s not a
dracolich. Savvy?</p>

<p>In any case, he feels to me like better villain material than the Dragon of
Tyr. The Dragon and the other Sorcerer-Kings mostly want to maintain the status
quo, while Dregoth has an intrinsinc motivation to shake things up. At least, he
would make much better villainous speeches about how he’s going to Show Them
All than any of the others.</p>

<p>Any campaign with Dregoth as an active antagonist will have the PCs meet his
troops much earlier. They’re mostly dray, both alive and undead, who tend to be
evil assholes and consider themselves superior to those who have ties to the old
Giustenal. They often have the Psionic Adept monster theme (more on Monster
Themes later).</p>

<p>Absalom is dangerous, but his level is so much lower than Dregoth’s you’re not
likely to meet both of them at once. He’s either the guy you convince to ally
with you against Dregoth, or the guy you defeat on the way to enlisting
Dregoth’s aid to fight the Dragon of Tyr.</p>
