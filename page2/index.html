        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>We’re done with monsters for now, and we’re getting into a section about
terrain.</p>

<p>Terrain is as important a building block for a fun encounters as the monsters
that make it up, and this section has some uniquely Dark and Sunny examples for
you to add to your battlemaps.</p>

<h2 id="barbed-cacti">Barbed Cacti</h2>

<p>Even when they don’t uproot themselves to hunt you down, Athasian cacti can
still be dangerous. These specimens have sharp spines that break off and stay
stuck to you. Lines of barbed cactus squares can be used to cordon off some
areas of the battlefield, and provide an excellent barrier for artillery
monsters to hide behind.</p>

<p>Entering a square of barbed cacti deals 3 damage and inflices -2 to attack rolls
(save ends).</p>

<h2 id="brambleweed">Brambleweed</h2>

<p>Like barbed cacti, but worse. Brambleweed grows in sprawling thickets that can
thrive even in defiled areas, because they can use the blood or corpses of
captured creatures as nourishment. Some defilers plant them intentionally as
defensive measures in their lairs.</p>

<p>A creature that ends their turn in a brambleweed square is restrained until the
end of their next turn. A creature that <em>starts</em> their turn there (which they
will if they were restrained) takes 5/tier damage.</p>

<h2 id="defiled-terrain">Defiled Terrain</h2>

<p>This is a more varied category describing several possibilities for what might
remain behind after a major act of defiling. It can be used as pre-existing
terrain in an area what was subject to defiling in the past, or you can place it
in the middle of the fight after someone uses Arcane Defiling or an equivalent
power.</p>

<h3 id="ash-field">Ash Field</h3>

<p>These are the remains of plant life caught in a defiling field. Sometimes the
wind causes them to pool in terrain depressions to form areas of Settled Ash,
which can act as a terrain feature.</p>

<p>Someone who’s adjacent to a square of settled ash can make an Athletics test to
raise a cloud of it, which functions as a blast attack vs. Fortitude that blinds
for a turn on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="black-sand">Black Sand</h3>

<p>The residue of defiling mixed in with the local soil. People standing on black
sand only regain half the normal amount of HP from healing effects. Wasn’t there
an entire geographical region covered in the stuff?</p>

<h3 id="dead-magic">Dead Magic</h3>

<p>Areas that have lost so much to defiling that they have nothing left to
give. Anyone standing on dead magic squares takes a -5 penalty to attack with
arcane or primal powers, and is barred from using Arcane Defiling.</p>

<p>The book recommends being careful with dead magic areas, particularly if there
are a lot of arcane and primal PCs in the party. Usually only very powerful
defilers are capable of creating them.</p>

<h3 id="sickening-heat">Sickening Heat</h3>

<p>This is either a mystical side effect of defiling, or it could just be a natural
consequence of killing all that plant cover. Creatures ending their turn on
these squares are weakened for a turn.</p>

<p>This terrain can do a number on your party’s strikers, and monsters who have the
ability to inflict forced movement simply love it.</p>

<h2 id="glimmering-mirage">Glimmering Mirage</h2>

<p>Mundane mirages are the effect of heat haze in the distance. These ones are more
than that: they’re illusions crafted by malicious primal spirits. In addition to
luring travelers, they persist once they get closer, and can conceal all kinds
of danger behinds their alluring façades.</p>

<p>Glimmering mirages form walls 4 or more squares long. They block line of sight,
and give concealment against ranged attacks to anyone standing adjacent to
them. At the end of every turn, you roll a d6 for each mirage. A 1 means it’s
gone, a 6 means it moves 5 squares, and other results mean it stays put.</p>

<h2 id="lightning-pillar">Lightning Pillar</h2>

<p>Literally a pillar of congealed lightning, probably created due to the area’s
proximity to an “electric” region of the Elemental Chaos. PCs and enemies might
be able to use their Arcana, Nature, or Religion skills to “hack” such a pillar
and make it deliver a lightning strike to a chosen target.</p>

<h2 id="mudflats">Mudflats</h2>

<p>These are natural areas where underground water surfaces a bit and mixes with
the soil, creating an area that is both dusty and sludgy at the same
time. Inland mudflats are the next best thing to oases, and draw many animals
and people who learn to extract water from them.</p>

<p>Particularly thick mud flats are difficult terrain, and can contain <strong>mud sink</strong>
squares representing deeper areas. Creatures standing adjacent to those can be
pushed into them, which will immobilize them (save ends), with a slow
after-effect due to the clinging mud (also save ends). Voluntarily or
accidentally stepping into one would have the same effect.</p>

<h2 id="psychic-reservoirs">Psychic Reservoirs</h2>

<p>Fragile purple crystals that grow in psychically charged areas sheltered from
the winds, these can be tapped by psionic characters to boost their attacks. It
takes a minor action to tap into an adjacent crystal, which makes it crumble to
dust. If the character uses power points, they gain 1 bonus point that lasts
until the end of the encounter. Otherwise they gain +5 to their next damage roll
from a psionic power.</p>

<h2 id="rocky-badlands">Rocky Badlands</h2>

<p>These regions are too rough to support permanent settlements, so they’ll mostly
feature as ambush sites. They’re filled with <strong>teetering stone pillars</strong> that
can be pushed onto enemies.</p>

<h2 id="salt-flats">Salt Flats</h2>

<p>These bone-dry regions are a hassle to fight in, as salt will inevitably get in
the wounds and make them sting like hell. They’re also filled with loose <strong>salt
piles</strong> that work a lot like the Settled Ash hazard above, except that they also
slow the target if it was bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="sandy-wastes">Sandy Wastes</h2>

<p>What most people think of when they hear “desert”. They can contain 3x3-square
<strong>Small Dunes</strong> that anyone might use as a hiding or ambush spot, even if they
can’t normally burrow.</p>

<h2 id="silt-pools">Silt Pools</h2>

<p>They work a lot like mud flats, except there’s no water, just very fine
dust. Usually filled with difficult terrain, and with <strong>deep silt spots</strong> that
restrain (save ends) anyone who falls or gets pushed into them.</p>

<h2 id="slipsand">Slipsand</h2>

<p>Sandy areas where some magical or psionic effect caused a significant amount of
tiny glass crystals to be mixed in with the sand. They’re slippery <em>and</em> sharp,
requiring an Athletics check from any who enters them to avoid falling prone and
taking damage.</p>

<h2 id="tree-of-life">Tree of Life</h2>

<p>These extremely rare plants are imbued with a much greater than usual amount of
vital energy, which enables them to resist and even recover from defiling
attempts given enough time. Ironically, this makes them extremely valued by
sorcerer-kings and other powerful and rich defilers, which cultivate them for
use as batteries.</p>

<p>I think earlier editions kept a more or less precise list of the remaining trees
of life in Athas - they were <em>that</em> rare. In this edition, I believe their
number is less restricted, but the most likely place you’re going to find one is
still in the “boss room” for these defilers.</p>

<p>Trees of life emit a 5-square aura. Creatures within always regain the maximum
possible HP from variable healing effects, and have a +5 to perform divination
rituals.</p>

<p>Whenever someone performs Arcane Defiling inside the aura, or use some other
necrotic power that damages one of their allies, the tree takes the damage
instead. Trees have 500 HP and Vulnerable 10 Necrotic, and die when they
hit 0. They regenerate 5 HP per hour.</p>

<h2 id="ztal-horde">Z’Tal Horde</h2>

<p>A much funnier and more mundane piece of terrain! Z’tals are tiny, slimy, stinky
lizard-bug-things that gather in very large swarms. They’re relatively harmless,
but still a bother.</p>

<p>A z’tall horde fills one or more squares, which are difficult terrain. Someone
who ends their movement in such a square takes 5/tier poison damage from the
stink. Someone who starts their turn in a horde square must roll a save before
taking any other actions. A failure means they fall prone because of the
slippery slime. A close or area attack that deals at least 1 point of damage
will automatically disperse a horde square with no roll required.</p>

<p>They’re sometimes bred as living security measures, but a horde of these
annoying scavengers might naturally form around the corpse of any large
creature.</p>

<h2 id="next-up">Next Up</h2>

<p>Hazards! What, you thought these were the hazards?</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2026/01/28/wir-dscc-sunwarped-monster.html">Let&#39;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Sunwarped Monster</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This is your one stop shop for generating horribly mutated varieties of standard
monsters. The name “Sunwarped” comes from the belief that these mutations are
caused by Athas’ scorching sun, but there are many different causes. These
creatures might have been exposed to concentrated psionic energy, lived for too
long in defiled areas, or been victims of terrible experiments.</p>

<p>The Pristine Tower is also a prime source of mutated monstrosities, altering any
who linger near it for too long. To hear people talk about it, it was the <em>only</em>
such source in previous editions, but now it’s just one more among many.</p>

<p>Sunwarped creatures are obviously misshapen when compared to typical
specimens. They might be exceedingly assymetrical, have extra limbs or eyes, and
so on. These descriptors give me a kind of “science fantasy” vibe, because they
match what you would expect radiation to do in 50s-style atomic horror tales.</p>

<p>Anyway, sunwarped creatures get a +2 to Endurance, and might also get one or two
<strong>Sunwarped Traits</strong> in addition to their extra theme powers. These traits
usually give it an extra bonus in one area and a small penalty in another. There
is a table here with some examples, but the GM is free to come up with others.</p>

<p>So a creature might get digging claws that give it climb and burrow speeds equal
to its base speed, but also reduce that base speed by 1. Or uneven eyes that
give it all-around vision but inflict a -3 penalty to ranged and area
attacks. Or something that gives +1 to one defense and -1 to another.</p>

<p>All of these changes are situational, and their effectiveness depends entirely
on the monster they get applied to. A Brute with no ranged attacks will find
those uneven eyes to be a pure bonus, while an extra limb that aids in grappling
would be wasted on an artillery monster. While you can min-max and only give
monsters traits that increase their power, you can also do the opposite to show
how random these mutations can be.</p>

<h2 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h2>

<p>The split is pretty clear in this theme - attack powers either deal damage or
apply debuffs to others.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Breath of the Blazing Sun</strong> probably has this name because almost no one in
Athas would know what radiation is. It’s a Close Blast 4 vs. Fortitude that
blinds its targets and makes them vulnerable to radiant and fire damage (save
ends both).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Burning Blood</strong> will make xenomorph fans happy, as it represents a
high-pressure jet of hazardous blood spraying out when the creature is
hit. This is a reaction that makes a Close Blast 3 attack vs. Reflex, and
inflicts ongoing acid + fire damage (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ravaging Fury</strong> is a free action encounter power, meaning it can be used in
the creature’s own turn without spending actions. Once this is used, if the
creature hits with its next attack it will immediately gain an action point
that it can use before the end of its next turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sticky Hide</strong> makes the monster be constantly covered in goo. Any enemy that
hits the creature with a melee attack is subject to an attack vs. their
Reflex, and if that hits the weapon used on the attack gets yanked out of
their hands and and sticks to the monster’s slimy coating. Recovery is
automatic but requires staying adjacent to the monster and spending a standard
action.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>These heal of buff the creature itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enraged Growth</strong> makes the monster grow one size category when first
bloodied! It pushes anyone adjacent to make room, and gains 10 temporary
HP/tier. This gets more awesome when you apply it to a monster that is already
big.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Feast on Flesh</strong> causes the creature’s melee basic attack to give it 5/tier
temporary HP on a hit as it consumes some of the target’s flesh. The book
itself says that while you’d expect to see this only for bite attacks, you can
add it to any attack and come up with a suitably freaky explanation for why it
works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Misshapen Body</strong> means the creature’s important anatomical bits are not
where you’d expect them to be, so it can roll a d20 when it takes a critical
hit, downgrading it to a normal hit on a result of 10+. These are the same
mechanics of a normal save, but since they’re written out in full I guess it
means it doesn’t <em>count</em> as a save, so wouldn’t get general save bonuses such
as those of an elite or solo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can also make such misshapen creatures <strong>Steady-Footed</strong>, letting them
also roll actual saves against falling prone because their weird shape ends up
being more stable.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I get a very strong “atomic horror” vibe from this theme, except it’s happening
in a setting where people don’t know about radiation, and so the mutations get
blamed on other causes.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As we all know by now, psychic powers are very common in Athas. Anyone might
have some, even if that’s not their main specialty. For PCs, this is implemented
as a couple of character themes (Noble Adept and Wilder).</p>

<p>For NPCs and monsters, we have the Psionic Adept theme presented here. You can
add this to a non-psionic monster to make it more controller-ish.</p>

<p>Psionic Adepts gain a +2 to either either Diplomacy and Intimidate (force of
personality!) or to Insight and Perception (sixth sense!).</p>

<h2 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h2>

<p>Following the usual design strategy of adding new abilities that work “around”
established attacks, we get a collection of powers that hinder and debuff
enemies. All of the ones that require attack rolls target Will.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blind the Mind’s Eye</strong> (recharge 5+) is a ranged attack that makes the
creature invisible to the target (save ends). This ends when the creature
attacks the target. Lurkers can use this to enable their big attacks, while
others can use it as a way to ease pressure on themselves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Empathic Wall</strong> (recharge 6+) creates a 12-square wall that lasts a turn. It
blocks line of sight. People can cross it, but its squares are difficult
terrain, and anyone inside them is lightly obscured.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mantle of the Mind</strong> (encounter) is a close burst 4 that attacks will and
prevents affected targets from targeting the creature with their attacks (save
ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mental Marionette</strong> (encounter) is a sustainable domination power. It
dominates for a turn on a hit, but can be sustained with standard actions to
let the creature repeat the attack against the same target, potentially
prolonging the domination. On a miss, it dazes for a turn. It’s a little
weaker than a fire-and-forget (save ends) power, because it eats up standard
actions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Three variants of <strong>Psionic Augmentation</strong> that add a little extra something
when the creature hits with a melee basic attack. One deals extra psychic
damage, the other dazes for a turn, and the third one inflicts ongoing psychic
damage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>These are a lot more clearly “utilities” than the ones for elemental
creatures. They’re all encounter powers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mental Bastion</strong> is an interrupt that gives a +4 to Will, potentially
turning a hit into a miss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Open the Mind’s Eye</strong> gives blindsight 5 and all-around vision for a
turn. The latter means the creature cannot be flanked.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Oracular Empathy</strong> is a weird one. When an nearby ally of the creature is
hit by an attack, the creature can use a reaction to switch its initiative
order to be just after the attacker’s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Psionic Flight</strong> automatically pushes each adjacent enemy 1 square and lets
the creature fly its speed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Pretty cool! It seems more thematically tight to me than Elementally
Infused. Adding these powers to someone like an ogre would be a nice/nasty
surprise.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2026/01/20/wir-dscc-themes-elemental.html">Let&#39;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Elementally-Infused Monster</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Athas is a world particularly close to the Elemental Chaos, and so there are
lots of places in it that are soaked in elemental energies of some kind. The
creatures that inhabit these areas often end up elementally-infused.</p>

<p>The book suggests changing the creature’s origin to elemental if its mutations
end up being inheritable, though that just affects the lore and so it’s just
necessary if it will affect the game’s stories in some way.</p>

<p>The main mechanical thing you must decided about an elementally-infused creature
is its element. All of its powers that deal damage have it written as “[damage
type]” in the book, and you’re meant to replace that lacuna with a type
corresponding to the creature’s associated elements: one of fire, acid, cold,
thunder, or lightning (very very frightening!).</p>

<p>Not all of its attacks need to do the same type of damage. Multi-element
elementals are a thing now, after all. And you might decide to make one or more
of these attacks untyped, which would be common for an earth elemental whose
rock-based attacks deal physical damage for example.</p>

<p>Elementally-infused creatures get +2 to Intimidate and Athletics.</p>

<h2 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h2>

<p>All of these powers deal damage of the type you chose above.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There are two <strong>Elemental Auras</strong>, one that triggers when the monster is
bloodied and damages enemies inside, and one that is always active and makes
enemies vulnerable to your chosen element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Eruption</strong> causes an explosion when the monster is first bloodied,
a close burst 2 that targets Reflex and deals elemental damage equal to the
monster’s best basic attack.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Manifestation</strong> converts the damage of all of the monster’s
attacks to your chosen element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Persistence</strong> is recharge 5+ and inflicts 5/tier ongoing damage of
the chosen type when the monster hits with a melee attack. It’s said to
increase “damage output and entertainment value”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h2>

<p>The most obvious here is <strong>Elemental Damage Resistance</strong>, which should be high
enough for the monster to resist its own attacks (or I guess 5/tier if you don’t
want to do math). If a monster’s attacks are untyped, you could give it
variable resistance instead.</p>

<p>Nearly all of the others deal damage, proving that the “attack”/”utility” split
is more of a guideline here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Dissipation</strong> lets the monster vanish from play for a turn and
reform next to an enemy, dealing a bit of damage and making them grant combat
advantage for another turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Ground</strong> is a third aura variant, this time meant to keep enemies
close. The aura’s radius becomes difficult terrain and enemies take damage
when they leave it, instead of when they enter it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Step</strong> deals elemental damage to anyone who hits the monster with
an opportunity attack while it moves.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Elemental Transport</strong> lets the monster teleport between patches of hazardous
terrain that deal damage of the chosen type. Clever!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mutable Body</strong> is appropriate for water-based or otherwise gooey monsters,
and lets the creature count as one size smaller when squeezing through narrow
openings.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>You want elemental damage? We got elemental damage! I like the design strategy
of additional attack powers that modify and work around the monster’s usual
attacks, and it works particularly well here.</p>

            <p>What’s a Monster Theme? The concept was first introduced in Dungeon Master’s
Guide 2, and it’s a way to give a set of monsters a shared look and feel. This
involves changes to their mechanics and lore, but unlike monster <em>templates</em>
from the DMG 1, it doesn’t change their “quality”. Regulars remain regulars,
elites remain elites, and so on.</p>

<p>Monster themes end up being more flexible than templates, since the monster
creation rules are good enough to handle any level or quality changes by
themselves.</p>

<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-monster-theme">Anatomy of a Monster Theme</h2>

<p>Each theme has a fairly involved presentation. You get some explanation for the
lore attached to that theme and how it might modify a monster. Then a line about
skill changes that might apply, and finally a big list of powers.</p>

<p>Those powers are divided between Attack Powers and Utility Powers - you pick one
of each category to add to the monster’s stat block. Nothing else about its
basic stats changes, unlike with a template. If you want those to change, you
can use the standard monster creation and “editing” rules to change the
monster’s level or quality.</p>

<h2 id="our-first-theme-arena-bred-monster">Our First Theme: Arena Bred Monster</h2>

<p>Blood sport arenas are the most popular entertainment in all city states, and
monster fighting is one of its most popular modalities. It’s common to throw
recently captured wild animals into the ring, but a monster that was
specifically prepared for the spectacle is a much bigger draw. Animals are
specifically bred for the role; people receive special training. And both might
be further modified by magic or psionics, all in the service of providing a more
brutal and spectacular fight.</p>

<p>Monsters with this theme get a +2 to Intimidate and a +2 to either Athletics or
Acrobatics.</p>

<h3 id="attack-powers">Attack Powers</h3>

<p>Despite the name of this category, the powers here tend to avoid having specific
attack or damage figures, to better enable them to apply to monsters of any
level.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Berserk Passage</strong> (recharge 5+) lets a monster make two basic attacks and
shift half its speed at any moment in this sequence, passing through enemy
spaces. It usually goes on monsters that have been made mad with hunger and
pain before being dropped into the arena, though I supposed it could also be
used to represent an agile duelist humanoid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bleeding Attack</strong> is a triggered power that inficst 5/tier ongoing damage
(save ends) when the monster bloodies a target. It might represent serrated
weapons or claws. The book recommends making it (recharge 5+) for elites or
solos; by default, it’s at-will.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Brutal Flourish</strong> lets the monster make a free melee basic attack whenever
it bloodies or defeats an enemy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Death Burst</strong> means the monster has been rigged to explode! This is visible
to the PCs and should be described appropriately. This power is common for
monsters that have received some sort of combat implant, but could be applied
even without that. By default this happens when the monster hits 0 HP, but for
elites and solos it could also happen when the monster is first bloodied,
where it might be combined with some other change in its stats as those
implanted bits fall off. The explosion is a Close Burst 2 with attack and
damage figures appropriate to the monster’s level.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Retaliating Stride</strong> (recharge 5+) is a move action that lets the monster
move its speed and deal damage to any creature that hits it with an
opportunity attack during this move. It can represent showy counterstrikes, or
maybe something like implanted spikes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Attached Weapons</strong> are not written up like a power, but discussed in general
terms inside a text box. Many arena monster handlers like to implant extra
weapons on their charges through magic. This is an excuse for your to add
extra attack powers that monsters of that type don’t normally have. For
example, an artillery monster could receive implanted melee weapons that give
it a stronger than usual melee attack, or a brute could get an unusually
accurate ranged weapon. It’s common for these weapons to break or fall off
when the monster is bloodied - and this can also be combined with Death Burst
variants.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="utility-powers">Utility Powers</h3>

<p>These are generally the fruit of long experience in the arena, representing
cunning, resilience, and luck.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Intervening Armor</strong> represents an ability to leverage the normally useless
piecemeal armor that covers gladiators by shifting so enemy attacks hit the
tiny plates. It’s an Interrupt that gives +2 to AC or Reflex when the monster
is hit by an attack targetting one of these defenses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Necessary Betrayal</strong> is for treacherous gits who developed the habit of
abusing their teammates’ trust. If the monster is hit by a melee or ranged
attack while adjacent to an ally, it can swap places with the ally as an
interrupt, and have the ally take damage from the attack instead. You don’t
compare the attack roll against the ally’s defenses - just apply the damage
directly. This power cannot be nice even by accident.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Shake it Off</strong> represents the ability to quickly recover one’s wits in a
bout. Whenever subject to an effect that a save could possibly end, the
monster can roll a save to end it as a reaction, even if this specific
application cannot be ended with a save. (So it works against “dazed until the
end of the next turn”, but not against “dead”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Turn the Tables</strong> is a defense against forced movement. If pushed, pulled,
slid, or knocked prone, the creature can trigger this reaction to stand up (if
prone) and shift 2 squares.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think it’s interesting how many of the powers here can be either applied to a
berserk beast of a flashy humanoid fighter that uses finesse and agility, with
the final mechanical result being the same.</p>
