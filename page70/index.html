<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Githyanki are another one of those D&amp;D monsters who surpass the “classic” and
hit the “iconic”. They originally appeared in the AD&amp;D 1st Edition Fiend Folio,
and were the creation of Charles Stross, who today is an award-winning science
fiction author. Here, they’re present in both books.</p>

<p>Judging by the other RPG.net Let’s Reads that are running at the same time as
this one, it seems like 3.x would spill a lot of ink creating other weird
extraplanar people in an attempt to make the “next githyanki”, mostly without
success. 5e would instead attempt to add new lore to them, with what I feel are
mixed results.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A very long time ago, or possibly a very long time in the future, the mind
flayers had a huge empire. This empire was built on the back of slaves. More
specifically, it was built on the back of the gith, a species broadly similar to
humanity.</p>

<p>The gith eventually rose up and gained their freedom by using the tools of their
tentacly oppressors: psychic powers! Once they didn’t have a common enemy to
unite against, the internal tensions of the gith began building up and
eventually exploded. The resulting conflict divided the gith into two people
with radically different philosophies: the xenophobic and militaristic
githyanki, and the contemplative and isolationist githzerai. We’ll focus on the
first here.</p>

<p>The githyanki migrated en masse to the Astral Sea and built their capital city
of Tu’narath on the corpse of a dead god. From there their astral ships sail on
piratical voyages, to juicy targets in the Astral Sea, the world, and perhaps
beyond.</p>

<p>Each ship captain has full discretion on which targets to pick and on how to run
their ship, but all ultimately answer to their lich queen Vlaakith, the supreme
ruler of the githyanki. A githyanki attack might be a simple raid, but it might
also be part of a more complex plan of their queen.</p>

<p>Aside from piracy, those astral ships also seek to find more of those gigantic
astral entity corpses and other such debris on which to build more cities and
expand their empire.</p>

<p>The preferred combat style of the githyanki mixes swordplay and psychic
powers. They wield psionically enchanted silver blades and use telekinesis to
perform impossible leaps and to attack at range with energy blasts. Their
initial publication back in the 1st Edition days probably did a lot to
popularize this “sword &amp; spell warrior” archetype, which is often nicknamed
“gish” in reference to them and is represented by the swordmage class in 4e.</p>

<p>Githyanki sometimes associate with red dragons, likely because both respect
martial prowess and have a hankerin’ for plundered treasure.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Despite living in the Astral Sea, githyanki are Medium Natural Humanoids since
they originated in the world. Their usual speed is 6 but armor may reduce that,
as for PCs.</p>

<p>All githyanki combatants wield a silver sword of some sort, which usually does
psychic damage. They can also perform a <strong>Telekinetic Leap</strong> as a move action
once per encounter, allowing themselves or an ally within 10 squares to fly 5
squares.</p>

<p>Their other psychic powers vary with each individual stat block. The MM versions
also have a +2 to saves against charm effects (meaning “powers with the Charm
keyword”), which is absent from the MV version.</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-warrior-both">Githyanki Warrior (Both)</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 12 Soldier with 118 HP, who wears plate and wields a
silver greatsword. Warriors likely make up the bulk of the crew on those pirate
ships, which would explain why they’re such a terror. The MV version is the best
of the two, so we’ĺl start with that and note the differences later.</p>

<p>That <strong>silver greatsword</strong> does psychic damage on a hit, and does bonus damage
against immobilized targets. As an effect, these basic attacks apply a
double-strenght mark against the target for a turn. This means the target gets a
-4 penalty to attack enemies other than the marking warrior instead of the usual
-2. I believe these are the only monsters to do so.</p>

<p>Warriors can also use a <strong>Telekinetic Grasp</strong> (Ranged 5 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6)
against Medium or smaller targets, doing no damage but immobilizing them (save
ends). Multiple warriors will know to split the tasks of immobilizing the PCs
and hitting them with the sword for that damage bonus.</p>

<p>The MV version is similar, but doesn’t mark with its attacks and the sword does
physical damage (the bonus damage is still psychic).</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-mindslicer-both">Githyanki Mindslicer (Both)</h3>

<p>This one focuses more on its powers than on its sword. It’s level 13 Artillery
with 98 HP. Again we start with the better MV version and note the differences
later.</p>

<p>The mindslicer’s weapon of choice is a <strong>silver longsword</strong>, which does psychic
damage as usual. It has two ranged options. <strong>Mindslice</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will)
does psychic damage at range. The <strong>Psychic Barrage</strong> (Area Burst 1 within 20
vs. Will; Recharge 6) spreads that over a wider area and adds a couple of nasty
riders: ongoing psychic damage and an inability to use daily or encounter powers
(save ends both).</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-raider-mv">Githyanki Raider (MV)</h3>

<p>This lightly-armored combatant is a Level 13 Skirmisher with 126 HP. Its
<strong>silver longsword</strong> deals psychic damage as usual, and it can shift 2 squares
as an effect when it attacks with the blade.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the raider can <strong>Slash and Dash</strong>, making an attack against
one creature, shifting up to its speed, and attacking another target. Each of
those does double the damage of a basic attack, half on a miss. As a move
action, it can shift up to 2 squares.</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-legionnaire-mv">Githyanki Legionnaire (MV)</h3>

<p>A Level 13 Minion Soldier which makes me thing I was wrong when I said the
Warrior above made up the bulk of their crews. This is basically a Minion
version of the warrior, down to its power selection and bonus damage against
immobilized targets.</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-gish-mm">Githyanki Gish (MM)</h3>

<p>This amusingly named fellow is a Level 15 Elite Skirmisher that might represent
a ship captain or officer. It has 226 HP, wears mail and wields a <strong>silver
longsword</strong>.</p>

<p>The basic attack is nothing special, dealing psychic damage with no riders. The
gish can make two of those per action. It can also shoot <strong>Force Bolts</strong> (Ranged
10 vs. Reflex; recharge 6) for a bit of ranged force damage. Once per encounter
it can fire off a <strong>Storm of Stars</strong>, performing four attacks (Ranged 5 vs. AC)
and dealing fire damage on those it hits.</p>

<p>The usual Telekinetic Leap is replaced by Astral Stride, an at-will move action
that allows the gish to teleport 6 squares and gain both insubstantial and
phasing for a turn. Yikes, I can see why this one didn’t make it into the
MV. It’s a bit too annoyingly hard to pin down.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The MM gives us three:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: 3 githyanki warriors and 2 redspawn firebelchers. Add them to the
list of people who do dragonspawn ranching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 4 warriors and 2 mindslicers. Your standard pirate squad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 3 warriors, 1 mindslicer, 1 gish and 1 nightmare. A captain and
their bodyguards plus a mount.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Replacing the nightmare in that third one with an adult red dragon turns it into
a level 19 encounter. Using a reskinned chimera instead makes it
level 17. Y’know, just in case you want to have some fun with your players.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Githyanki are pirates who fight like Jedi, which makes them awesome in my book!
A campaign centered on planar travel is well-served by their addition. Even if
that’s not a major theme, a sudden githyanki raid can make a nice random
encounter, or an unwelcome complication for an otherwise unrelated crisis.</p>

<p>Gibbering beasts used to be several different monster entries that originally
appeared throughout AD&amp;D and 3.x in different places. Here they were quite
sensibly collected together. They appear only on the Monster Manual, but
received an MV-style update in Dungeon #192, so we’ll look at them there too.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A gibbering beast is a slimy, amorphous, oozelike creature covered in eyes and
mouths. And eyes with mouths. And mouths with eyes. And eyes inside mouths. And
is that a bunch of teeth just kinda sprouting from that quivering protuberance?</p>

<p>They crawl or float around, looking every which way with their eyes and
constantly spouting nonsense from their mouths, which they also use to attack
and eat other creatures. The nonsense can be just as dangerous as the bites, as
it warps the minds of those who hear it and makes them easy prey for the
beast.</p>

<p>The lesser varieties of gibbering beast spontaneously generate when something
dies in places touched by the influence of the Far Realm, which causes the
corpse’s face to detach and become a newborn beast. Over time they can grow and
become both smarter and more powerful. Sometimes the strongest varieties travel
directly from the Far Realm to the world, bent on enacting some insane scheme of
their own.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gibbering beasts are Aberrant Magical Beasts, and they all have All-Around
Vision and Darkvision. Creatures with All-Around Vision can’t be flanked, which
makes it a lot harder to get combat advantage against them.</p>

<p>Their other signature trait is their incessant <strong>Gibbering</strong>, a free action that
happens at the start of their turns: Close Burst 5 vs. Will, a hit dazes the
targets for a turn. Deafened creatures are immune to this.</p>

<p>All Gibbering Beasts are Unaligned, which is very appropriate for truly alien
aberrant entities.</p>

<h3 id="gibbering-mouther">Gibbering Mouther</h3>

<figure class="left">

  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>The weakest and most classic among these entries, the gibbering mouther is
Medium and a Level 10 Controller with 110 HP. It moves at speed 5 on land, and
can swim at the same speed. Its mere presence warps the space around it, which
works as an Aura 3 that acts as difficult terrain against enemies.</p>

<p>The mouther’s basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> that deals physical damage and ongoing
5 acid damage (save ends). Its <strong>Gibbering</strong> works as described above, and opens
the way for <strong>Gibbering Feast</strong> (Close Burst 5), a power which causes unnatural
mouths to appear on any dazed creatures in the area and perform a basic bite
attack against them. Now <em>that’s</em> an aberrant creature! “Your left hand grows a
mouth and tries to eat your face” is top-notch horror imagery.</p>

<p>Gibbering mouthers have Int 4, and are sapient enough to work with other
aberrant or even non-aberrant creatures if they see advantage in doing so. The
Dungeon update is identical aside from the fixed damage numbers and the lack of
the Gibbering Feast’s colorful description.</p>

<h3 id="gibbering-abomination">Gibbering Abomination</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-gibbering-abomination.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A bigger mouther. It’s still Medium, but it’s a Level 18 Controller with 168
HP. It’s faster and trades some buoyancy for flight, with a land speed of 6 and
a flight speed of 4 (hover, maximum altitude 1).</p>

<p>Its <strong>Unnatural Utterances</strong> work as an Aura 5 that inflicts a -2 attack penalty
on any enemies caught within. They periodically increase in intensity to perform
the standard <strong>Gibbering</strong> attack.</p>

<p>The abomination’s basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Tentacle</strong> that does immediate
physical and ongoing psychic damage (save ends). It can also stare at you really
hard with the <strong>Eye of Despair</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will; Recharge 3-6), which does
psychic damage and immobilizes (save ends).</p>

<p>The gibbering abomination does extra “sneak attack” damage against creatures it
has combat advantage against, but it sadly lacks an extra-creepy ability like
Gibbering Feast. It does have Int 11, meaning it will make more complex (though
no less insane) plans than the mouther. The Dungeon update simply fixes its
damage totals.</p>

<h3 id="gibbering-orb">Gibbering Orb</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-gibbering-orb.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2008 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This Huge Level 27 Solo Controller has 1230 HP and has arrived directly from the
Far Realm to do Cthulhu-knows-what. With its Int 17, it’s capable of hatching
elaborate schemes. Given that it has a whole suite of <em>eye rays</em>, it might give
you an idea of what beholders were like before migrating to the world and being
mutated by the trip. It flies at speed 8 (hover).</p>

<p>The orb’s <strong>Merciless Eyes</strong> work like an Aura 5; anyone who starts their turn
inside and visible gets targetted by a random eye ray.</p>

<p>The orb’s basic bite attack does damage and causes the mouth that made it to
detach and automatically attack the target again at the start of the orb’s
subsequent turns! This lasts until the mouth misses with an attack, at which
point it falls off and rots.</p>

<p>The Gibbering works as for the other monsters, but is a Close Burst 10.</p>

<p>The orb can also spend its standard action to make two different eye ray attacks
in addition to any automatic ones from Merciless Eyes. The orb can choose which
rays it uses when it does this, from the following selection:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Mindcarving</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Will; psychic damage and daze (save ends).</li>
  <li><strong>Fleshtearing</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Fort; necrotic damage and ongoing
necrotic damage (save ends).</li>
  <li><strong>Bonewarping</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Fort; physical damage and weakness (save
ends).</li>
  <li><strong>Bloodfeasting</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Reflex; physical damage and ongoing physical
damave (save ends).</li>
  <li><strong>Farsending</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Reflex; transported to the Far Realm for a turn; on
return, takes psychic damage and suffers a -5 penalty to attacks until the
end of the encounter.</li>
  <li><strong>Souleating</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Will; slows (save ends); worsens to immobilization
on first failed save; target dies on second failed save.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s a pretty fearsome selection, and the names do a lot to evoke that body
horror feeling. It’s less varied than the rays available to a Beholder Eye
Tyrant, but every ray does damage, there’s two different ongoing damage effects
that can stack with each other and a daze to catch people the <strong>Gibbering</strong>
misses.</p>

<p>The farsending ray is also pretty brutal, since it instantly removes a character
from play for the whole next turn and saddles then with a long-lasting attack
penalty. Not <em>quite</em> as bad as death, but worse than a stun effect. And of
course there’s a gradual death effect.</p>

<p>Gibbering Orbs are boss battle material for a level 23 or 24 party, and with a
bit of leveling could be promoted to the “campaign end boss” role as one of
those Outer Gods that orbit Azathoth or the equivalent.</p>

<p>The Dungeon update reduces their HP to 984, and the radius of its Gibbering to
the standard 5 squares. It also fixes its damage, increasing it considerably.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>Gibbering beasts go well with any other aberrant or aberrant-adjacent creature
(like cultists and such). Even the gibbering mouther knows the value of
cooperation, and they certainly might be bullied into service by more powerful
monsters.</p>

<p>Unlike the other, lesser beasts, gibbering orbs prefer to work alone and don’t
seek out alliances. However, their presence generates spontaneous phenomena and
attracts creatures that end up effectively acting as its heralds and harbingers.</p>

<p>The sample encounters in the book are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 2 gibbering mouthers, 1 foulspawn seer, 2 foulspawn berserkers, and
1 chuul.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: 1 gibbering abomination, 2 nabassu gargoyles, 1 aboleth lasher and 2
kuo-toa guards.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>One constant theme in the comments I’ve been getting in these entries are that
few of the aberrant monsters seen so far seem worthy of that origin, being far
less alien than what someone would expect from the Far Realm.</p>

<p>I feel that if there’s one family of monsters worthy of the “Aberrant” title,
it’s the gibbering beasts. The Gibbering Orb is awesome in that role, and the
“basic” Gibbering Mouther is actually better at evoking horror than the
abomination, with its “your body grows mouths and tries to eat itself” attack.</p>

<p>Storm giants are another classic giant type, present since at least the days of
AD&amp;D. In Fourth Edition they seem to have been merged with cloud giants, which
used to be quite close in power to them and differed mostly on alignment. Both
seem to have been inspired by the giant from Jack and the Beanstalk. They’re
present only in the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Back at the dawn of time, storm titans and giants were the favored servants of
the primordials, and were given command over the rest of their kind. In the
present day there’s no unified giant society for them to rule, but storm giants
are still closer to what they were at the height of their power than the other
giants. They’re as much at home underwater or flying through the sky as they are
on land.</p>

<p>I imagine that, unlike the other classic giants, these don’t usually raid or
invade nearby mortal settlements. The domains of a storm giant would already be
well-established and be located very far away from any “mundane”
locations. That’s not to say they’re <em>pleasant</em> places for anyone but the giants
themselves, at least not necessarily.</p>

<p>Storm giants build (or command their servants to build) marvelous castles in
places mortals can’t usually reach, like the bottom of the sea or islands
floating above the clouds. They might settle for the top of a tall mountain if
they want to slum it. In these lordly palaces they keep all sorts of fantastical
treasures.</p>

<p>When storm giants feel a need to make war, they summon enormous storms upon
which their armies ride to battle. These are known as Harbinger Storms, and are
likely one of the most sure omens that whoever they rain upon is fucked.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Storm giants and titans are Large and Huge Elemental Humanoids,
respectively. They have the Aquatic and Giant keywords. They have resistance to
lightning and thunder, along with both swim and fly speeds. They also have
command of lightning and storms, being surrounded by mini-storms in combat.</p>

<p>These giants are quite sophisticated and intelligent, having a typical Int
of 14. The ones presented here are Evil as befits the beanstalk giant, though
you could certainly make a case for less nasty individuals in your stories.</p>

<p>This is a Level 24 Controller with 228 HP. Its elemental resistances are set to
15; it runs and swims at speed 8, and flies at speed 10. In combat it surrounds
itself with a small storm that acts as an Aura 2, inflicting 10 lightning and
thunder damage to anyone caught inside, and preventing them from flying unless
they’re other storm giants/titans.</p>

<p>The storm giant wields a Crackling Greatsword in combat (Reach 2 vs. AC) which
does a mix of physical and lightning damage. The giant can sweep the sword in a
wide arc (Close Burst 2 vs. AC; Recharge 6), damaging everyone it hits. It can
also hurl thunderbolts (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex) for lightning and thunder
damage. In addition to doing damage, they also push the target 3 squares and
daze them (save ends) on a hit.</p>

<p>Finally, it can temporarily intensify its storm aura into a burst of Howling
Winds (Close Burst 4 vs. Fortidude; Recharge 5-6) which does thunder damage,
pushes 4 squares, and knocks prone on a hit. On a miss, this still does half
damage and pushes 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="storm-titan">Storm Titan</h3>

<p>The Storm Titan is a Level 27 Elite Controller with 506 HP, and is basically a
beefed-up storm giant in all respects. Its Huge in size, with the same movement
speeds and modes. Its resistances are doubled to 30 as is the radius of its
storm aura.</p>

<p>The titan has exact the same attacks as the giant, with melee Reach 3 where
appropriate and increased accuracy and damage based on level. As an elite
monster it can also perform two greatsword attacks per action.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The MM gives us one sample encounter: Level 27, 1 storm titan, 1 thunderblast
cyclone elemental, 2 storm gorgons. You can likely expect similarly themed
elementals and blue dragons to make up the retinues of other storm giants and
titans.</p>

<p>I like them, particularly due to the Jack and the Beanstalk associations. I
don’t mind losing cloud giants in the conversion to 4e. It seems fitting that
the giant you find atop the cloud is the one that wants to grind your bones for
seasoning, not invite you to dinner. And if you really want to you could bring
the good sky giants back using these same stats.</p>

<p>I also don’t mind that the storm giant and titan share similar abilities -
conceptually, their set is fairly solid. The main problem here is that both
suffer from the fairly severe form of the damage bug that afflicts epic-level
creatures. You should definitely fix that before using them in your adventures.</p>

<p>Death Giants are a 3.x creation, first appearing in one of that edition’s
Monster Manual 2 or 3. For 4e, they get a new backstory. They appear only on the
Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Back at the dawn of creation when the titans were exploring the world, some of
them found their way to the Shadowfell and liked the place so much they moved
there permanently along with their giant children and allowed the energies of
the place to permeate their beings. And that’s how the first death titans and
giants came to be.</p>

<p>These giants have entirely abandoned their elemental nature and their allegiance
to the primordials, and are now fully creatures of the Shadowfell. They’re
probably also the world’s biggest fans of death metal. Though they stick mostly
to their native plane, they will sometimes live in the world in places like
graveyards and necropoli where the wall between the two planes is thin.</p>

<p>Death giants derive their power and sustenance from the souls of living
creatures. They don’t need to consume souls very often, but they still enjoy
hunting for sport and most of them are surrounded by a shroud of trapped,
wailing spirits waiting their turn to be lunch.</p>

<p>They’re fairly intelligent, but my impression is they’re not too fond of banding
together in large groups. They frequently associate with undead or with
necromantic cults that like performing sacrifices. The latter provide a steady
source of nutrition, since a death giant doesn’t need to personally kill someone
to trap their soul - the victim just has to die near the giant.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Death giants and titans are Large and Huge Shadow Humanoids with the Giant
keyword. They have Darkvision, resistance to necrotic damage, and an Aura 5 that
captures the soul of anyone who dies in range. They can spend these captured
souls to power some of their abilities. Their typical Int score is 12, making
them the smartest giants we’ve seen so far, and their alignment is Evil.</p>

<p>We get two stat blocks here, one for the giant and one for the titan, but you
can use the guidelines above to make your own.</p>

<h3 id="death-giant">Death Giant</h3>

<p>This is a Level 22 Brute with 255 HP. It has Resist 15 Necrotic and a speed
of 7. It wears mail and wields a greataxe.</p>

<p>The greataxe is Reach 2 and does physical damage with he High Crit property,
suffering from the damage bug. The giant’s most distinctive powers come from its
soul shroud.</p>

<p>Anyone who dies within 5 squares of a death giant adds one soul shard to its
shroud. No detail on whether this “shard” is a whole soul or a literal shard of
one. If it’s the latter, then a single death might add shards to multiple giants
if their auras overlap.</p>

<p>In any case, you can assume a death giant starts the fight with 4 shards in its
shroud unless your story demands otherwise. It can consume one shard to heal 20
HP, or spend it to power a Soulfire Burst (Close Burst 1 vs. Reflex) that does
necrotic damage and could <em>really</em> use a damage fix. If the giant’s shroud ever
runs out of shards, it takes a -2 penalty to its attacks until it can add more.</p>

<p>Since a being has to <em>die</em> to add a shard to the giant’s shroud, I think it’s
one of those monsters that has an incentive to finish off downed PCs. It also
pairs really well with minions, and you might also want to add some minion-like
innocent victims in your battlefield that the PCs would have an extra incentive
to protect.</p>

<h3 id="death-titan">Death Titan</h3>

<p>This is a Level 25 Elite Brute with 574 HP. Its aura works the same as that of
the death giant, and also inflicts a -2 penalty to the attacks of any enemies
within. Its necrotic resistance is 30, and its speed is 8.</p>

<p>Death titans wear plate and fight with Huge greataxes, which are Reach 3 and
have the High Crit property. They can attack twice per action with these axes.</p>

<p>The death titan’s soul shroud works the same way as that of the giant, but the
titan doesn’t need to wait for people to die around it! It has an ability called
Soul Devourer (Ranged 5 vs. Fortitude), which takes a bite off the soul of an
enemy, causing it to lose a healing surge and adding one soul shard to the
titan’s shroud. An excellent power to use from a distance while the titan’s
buddies engage in melee.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter in the MM is level 24: 1 death titan, 2 death giants, 1
voidsoul specter and 1 deathpriest hierophant.</p>

<p>IIRC, the deathpriest hierophant is tied to Orcus, the demon lord of undeath
(we’ll get to him in time). So perhaps you could say that in your campaign,
death giants were originally created by the primordial who became Orcus, and
that their transformation happened at the same time as that of their master.</p>

<p>Fire giants make up the final members of the “Against the Giants” trio. Like
their frosty cousins they’re inspired by Norse mythology, but their D&amp;D
incarnation is a lot less viking-ish. They’re present on both books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Fire giants have legendary reputations as builders and metalworkers, which makes
sense since every object usable by a fire giant has to be made of heat-resistant
metal or stone. They live in castles and fortified cities build around (and
atop, and under) active volcanoes or other sources of heat and magma.</p>

<p>These giants pine more strongly for their ancient glory days than most of their
kin, and engage in active empire-building instead of settling for simple
raiding. They make ample use of slaves, chief among which are the azer descended
from dwarves that didn’t manage to break free from them. They’ll enslave other
peoples just as readily though.</p>

<p>While still members of Team Primordial fire giants are typically Evil, probably
reflecting their more organized approach to life.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Fire giants are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Giant keyword, and their
titan bosses are Huge. They have 15 resistance resistance to fire, with titans
being more resistant. Like other giants their land speed is 8. Both fire giants
and titans have a typical Int score of 10.</p>

<p>They’re stronger than frost giants, but not by much. You can consider both types
to be evenly matched.</p>

<h3 id="fire-giant-flamecrusher-mv">Fire Giant Flamecrusher (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 17 Brute with 204 HP and all common traits outlined above. It
fights with a Searing Maul (Melee 2 vs. AC) that does a big chunk of fire
damage, and which can also be used in an Overhead Smash (Melee 2 vs. AC) that
does about the same damage and knocks the target prone.</p>

<p>Once bloodied, the flamecrusher gains the ability to flip out and deal a series
of Battering Blows to everyone around him (Close Burst 2 vs. AC), which do more
damage than the basic attack and push targets 2 squares. This is an encounter
power, but it recharges if the giant misses every target with it.</p>

<h3 id="fire-giant-both">Fire Giant (Both)</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 18 Soldier with 174 HP and all fire giant traits. It
wears giant-sized mail and fights with a Searing Greatsword that does fire
damage and marks for a turn on a hit. It can also sweep it in a wide arc (Close
Blast 2 vs. AC), dealing the same damage as the basic attack and marking anyone
it hits for a turn.</p>

<p>The MM version is nearly identical. Aside from suffering from the damage bug, it
can also throw Iron Javelins (Ranged 15/30 vs. AC), which do physical damage and
slow for a turn when they hit. Apparently fire giants are too sophisticated to
throw mere rocks. Personally, I’d add this attack to the MV version too.</p>

<h3 id="fire-giant-forgecaller-both">Fire Giant Forgecaller (Both)</h3>

<p>The spellcaster of the family, it’s Level 18 Artillery with 136 HP and training
in Perception. The Forgecaller fights in melee with a Smoldering Mace (Melee 2
vs. AC) that does fire damage, and uses All The Fire to fight at range.</p>

<p>This can take the form of a single-target Pillar of Flame (Ranged 20 vs. Reflex)
that does more fire damage than the mace, or an area-effect Flame Burst (Area 2
within 10 vs. Reflex; Recharge 6) which does both immediate and ongoing fire
damage (save ends), half of both on a miss.</p>

<h3 id="fire-titan-both">Fire Titan (Both)</h3>

<p>The fire titan is a Level 21 Elite Soldier with 398 HP. The MM version has 30
Fire Resistance, and the MV version upgrades that to complete immunity. Its
speed is 8. Like other titans, it’s mostly made up of its totemic element, with
magma skin and bonfire hair.</p>

<p>The titan fights with a Fiery Greatsword (Melee 3 vs. AC) which does a big glob
of fire damage, pushes 2 squares on a hit, and marks for a turn. It can make two
of these basic attacks per action.</p>

<p>It can also attack at range by hurling gobs of lava (Ranged 20 vs. Reflex;
recharge 5-6), which do fire damage, immobilize for a turn, and cause flying
targets to fall. On a miss they still do half damage and immobilize for a
turn. The MM version explicitly states this requires a source of lava, something
which the MV version omits. Considering the places where you’re likely to find a
fire titan, a source of lava should always be available! If it’s not, I suppose
it can just spit on its hand and throw that.</p>

<p>Finally the titan can project a Burning Wave (Close Burst 5 vs. Reflex),
presumably by flexing. This does immediate and ongoing fire damage to everyone
it hits. The MM version does half the immediate damage on a miss.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>We have two on the MM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 2 fire giants, 1 forgecaller, 1 azer beastlord, and 2 firebred hell
hounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 1 fire titan, 2 fire giants, 2 fire archon ash disciples, and 1
phoenix.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other creatures you’re likely to find in encounter group with fire giants would
include elementals with at least some fire in their composition, and red
dragons.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Fire giants are mechanically simpler than I expected, which I guess is a theme
for all the classic giants. They deal fire damage almost exclusively, so you
might want to change that if the party has very strong fire protection. I’d
probably give the basic fire giant a way to punish people who ignore its marks,
as I feel the -2 penalty for attacking other enemies isn’t enough deterrence at
these levels.</p>
