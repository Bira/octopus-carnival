<p>Monstrous centipedes have been in the game since the beginning, and are based on
real-world animals. Let’s see what 4e makes of them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>I only recently realized D&amp;D centipedes aren’t as fantastical as I always
thought. There are thousands of real-world centipede species, and the ones I was
familiar with were pretty small and generally not dangerous to people. However,
some species can reach up to 30cm (a foot!) in length, and have a poisonous bite
that might cause fever and chills in people. It’s possible for someone to be
allergic to centipede venom, and in that case their bite can cause anaphylatic
shock.</p>

<p>So the only fantastical thing about the D&amp;D centipede in early editions of the
game was the fact that its venom was always save-or-die. Its size was realistic,
and so was its venom in later editions when it became less deadly. Of course,
the game also had truly giant centipedes which were entirely fantastical, and
this remains true here.</p>

<p>Centipedes can be found in woodlands, caves, and lots of other
environments. They’re ferocious predators and aggressive enough to attack much
larger creatures if they feel threatened. The larger specimens are of a scale
large enough to see humanoids as potential prey, too.</p>

<p>Despite all this aggressiveness, it seems lots of sapient creatures are able to
keep them as pets and guard animals. I suspect magic might be
involved. Centipedes are particularly popular pets for Torog worshippers, who
consider them sacred.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Centipedes are Natural Beasts of varying size. The game gives them Darkvision,
though it might be more accurate to give them blindsight instead. The authors
didn’t consider a single foot-long centipede to be a worthy threat, so we get
stats for a swarm of them and for a giant specimen.</p>

<h3 id="centipede-swarm">Centipede Swarm</h3>

<p>This Medium swarm is a Level 2 Brute with 44 HP. It has ground and climb speeds
of 6, with Spider Climb (which allows them to cling to ceilings). It has all
standard swarm traits, taking half damage from melee and ranged attacks, and 10
extra damage from close and area attacks.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura (1) deals 3 automatic damage to each enemy caught
inside, +2 per centipede swarm adjacent to the enemy. This is deceptively
dangerous, particularly if you assume multiple swarm auras stack! An enemy
adjacent to a single swarm will take 5 damage at the start of their turn. An
enemy adjacent to 2 of them would take 14, or 7 if the auras don’t stack.</p>

<p>The swarm’s basic attack is a <strong>Swarm of Mandibles</strong> (vs. Reflex), which deals a
little bit of physical damage, which increases by 1 with each adjacent centipede
swarm. A hit also deals ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends). If the enemy is
already taking ongoing poison damage, they’re weakened (save ends).</p>

<p>If the swarm is hit by an area or close attack, their <strong>Survival Instinct</strong>
causes them to shift 3 squares as a reaction.</p>

<p>An interesting monster: despite being a brute, its attack is kinda weak. Most of
the damage comes from the swarm aura, particularly if you assume multiple
centipede swarm auras stack. You’ll never encounter just one swarm either -
there should be at least two in the group to enjoy those cool exponential
bonuses. More than two might be pushing a bit, though.</p>

<h3 id="centipede-scuttler">Centipede Scuttler</h3>

<p>A proper giant, this is a single Medium individual. It’s a Level 4 Skirmisher
with 51 HP and both ground and climb speeds of 8. Can’t run away from it.</p>

<p>Its <strong>bite</strong> targets AC and does a little more damage than the swarm’s, but has
the same riders. Against a weakened creature (which likely got that way from its
venom) it can <strong>Feed</strong>, dealing roughly triple the damage of a basic bite.</p>

<p>As an at-will move action, the Scuttler can, well, <strong>Scuttle</strong>, which allows it
to shift 4 squares. When it shifts into an ally’s space while scuttling, that
space doesn’t count as one of the 4 squares. Be sure to give it lots of
buddies when building the encounter.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get two encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 1 ankheg, 2 bloodthorn vines, and 2 centipede swarms. What rotten
luck that all of them would be hanging out next to each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 2 scuttlers, 1 gnoll huntmaster, 2 gnoll marauders. So they keep more
than hyenas as pets.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I liked the old save-or-die centipedes and these feel properly scary as well,
while also being distinct from all the other giant creepy crawlies.</p>

<p>Centaurs are inspired by Greek myth, in which they were The Worst (with rare
exceptions). They’ve been in D&amp;D since at least the days of BECMI, which even
had a supplement that made them playable.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Fourth Edition centaurs are a good deal nicer than their mythological
counterparts. Their culture venerates nature in its wilder aspects, and they
have an extensive martial tradition. In other words: they’re quite rowdy and
love a good fight. Kord and Melora are a lot more popular with them than
Corellon, who is otherwise the go-to fey deity. I don’t know if the lore of the
primal spirits had been finalized at this point, but centaurs also work great as
primal spirit worshippers.</p>

<p>Centaurs like to live in areas that contain vast plains or steppes, but they
like to build their settlements on hills or inside caves. The combination gives
them a defensible position surrounded by clear sight lines all around, and also
gives them the large space they need to run around and to grow their food.</p>

<p>Centaurs are not typically evil, but they’re territorial, mistrustful of
strangers, and hate people who despoil nature. Dealing with them peacefully
requires careful diplomacy that begins beyond arrow range. The prospective
ambassador should spend great effort making their approach both obvious and
obviously non-threatening. Once the centaurs recognize you for a friend, though,
they can become steadfast allies.</p>

<p>Most centaur settlements are located in the Feywild, though there are some in
the world bordering elven forests. Centaur law is simple, and most crimes carry
banishment and exile as their punishment. Exiled centaur criminals could easily
end up working with other villains.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Centaurs are Large Fey Humanoids, with low-light vision and a ground speed
of 8. They have two signature abilities. The first is that their basic attacks
do an extra die of damage when used in a charge. The other is a reaction called
<strong>Quick Kick</strong>, which allows them to make a free kick attack against an enemy
who moves into a position that flanks the centaur.</p>

<h3 id="centaur-hunter">Centaur Hunter</h3>

<p>If this was a PC, it would be a Twin Strike-spamming ranger. Hunters are Level
12 Artillery with 96 HP and all standard centaur traits.</p>

<p>They fight with classic horse archer tactics, using their superior mobility to
keep away and fire on the move. Their main ranged attack is <strong>Lightning-Fast
Arrows</strong> (range 25/50 vs. AC), a standard action that allows them to shoot
twice. Though each individual arrow has low damage, the two combined almost line
up with MM3 math.</p>

<p>Alternatively, they can use a <strong>Charge Arrow</strong> (ranged 25/50 vs. Fortitude) to
do a bit more single-arrow damage, push the target 3 squares, and knock it
prone. I’d say it’s not worth it unless the target is near a cliff or the hunter
has melee buddies that would benefit from a prone enemy.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the hunter can speed up even more and deliver a <strong>Triple
Shot</strong> (ranged 25/50 vs. AC), making three attacks whose individual damage is
a bit higher.</p>

<p>If someone does manage to engage the hunter in melee, it can defend itself with
a <strong>bastard sword</strong>… but it doesn’t really need to, since the <strong>Close-Combat
Archer</strong> trait makes it not provoke opportunity attacks from the targets of its
shots.</p>

<h3 id="centaur-ravager">Centaur Ravager</h3>

<p>The most likely melee buddy for the hunter, this is a barbarian-type. Ravagers
are Level 12 Brutes with 150 HP and all standard centaur traits. They fight in
melee with their <strong>bastard swords</strong>, and they can use a <strong>Berserk Rush</strong> (melee
1 vs. Fortitude; recharges when first bloodied) to do even more damage on a
charge, push the target 2 squares, and knock them prone. When first bloodied,
they also use <strong>Brash Retaliation</strong>, a free action attack that does high damage
and pushes the targets 2 squares.</p>

<p>All of this suggests shock cavalry tactics: charge, fight in place for a bit,
then move away and charge again. Though I guess ravagers have no problem staying
in the thick of it either.</p>

<h3 id="centaur-mystic">Centaur Mystic</h3>

<p>A wise primal or divine spellcaster, the mystic takes a priestly role in centaur
culture and advises the community on its duties towards nature and the
spirits. In combat they use plant- and earth-themed magic.</p>

<p>Mystics are Level 13 Controllers with 132 HP and all standard centaur
traits. They wield Reach 2 <strong>quarterstaffs</strong> which also acts as implements for
their magic. The mainstay here is <strong>Rootwhip Staff</strong>, a melee spell that targets
Reflex and does the same damage as a basic staff attack, but also slides the
target 3 squares and slows it (save ends).</p>

<p>The mystic’s ranged options are big guns with limited ammo:</p>

<p><strong>Ancestral Chargers</strong> is a Close Blast 5 that presumably summons ancestors
spirits and has funky mechanics. It targets both Fortitude and Will: you make a
single attack roll against both defenses. If the attack beats the target’s Will,
they take high psychic damage; if it beats the target’s Fortitude they’re
knocked prone and pushed 2 squares. This spell recharges when a friendly centaur
within 10 squares drops to 0 hit points, which implies the recharge comes from
summoning their recently departed spirit for one last strike.</p>

<p><strong>Biting Earth</strong> (Area Burst 2 within 10; recharges when first bloodied) creates
a zone that lasts for a turn and can be sustained with standard actions. The
biting earth zone immobilizes all enemies within. These enemies can choose to
take 3d8 damage to save against the effect as a free action. There’s no regular
save, so if the enemy doesn’t want to take damage they’re stuck in place while
the zone lasts. When the zone is sustained, the mystic can choose to move it up
to 3 squares.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can also use <strong>Mystic Resonance</strong> (minor action), which
affects all allies within 10 squares. It heals them for 10 HP and allows them to
roll a save.</p>

<p>Looks like you want to open with Ancestral Chargers here, and then use Biting
Earth to try and hold the PCs in place for the ravagers and hunters to do their
stuff.</p>

<h3 id="centaur-fey-charger">Centaur Fey Charger</h3>

<p>Fey chargers are significantly more powerful than the other centaurs we saw up
until now, being better fighters and having a host of storm-themed powers. This
would fit a warden or a paladin of Kord.</p>

<p>They’re level 18 Soldiers with 172 HP and all standard centaur traits. They wear
mail and carry a shield in addition to the traditional centaur bastard sword,
none of which slows them down.</p>

<p>They can fire <strong>Stabs of Lightning</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Reflex) do to lighthning
damage at range while closing in, but the main event is the melee. Once an
opening presents itself they close in with a <strong>Thunder Charge</strong>, a strong attack
that does a mix of physical and lightning damage and carries a secondary Close
Burst 2 attack that targets Fortitude, does thunder damage, knocks prone and
marks for a turn.</p>

<p>Once engaged, their <strong>sword</strong> attacks mark for a turn, and they can use
<strong>Thunder Hooves</strong> (melee 1 vs. Fortitude) as a reaction to attack anyone who
ignores the mark and do thunder damage to them.</p>

<h3 id="centaur-campaigner">Centaur Campaigner</h3>

<p>A legendary commander and champion of the centaur people with decades of
military experience. The campaigner is a Level 25 Soldier (Leader) with all
standard centaur traits and a good deal of supernatural wind- and storm-themed
abilities. It wears plate, and carries a shield and a longsword.</p>

<p>The bonus charge damage of the <strong>longsword</strong> attack is thunder, and the
Campaigner is all about that glorious impossible charge. Its <strong>Light Hoof</strong>
trait allows it to ignore all difficult terrain, and <strong>Sky Bound</strong> (at-will free
action) allows it to fly for the duration of its next move, though it must land
at the end. If that isn’t possible the centaur will gently float down to the
floor, so it doesn’t take fall damage but you might say its momentum gets kinda
ruined.</p>

<p>When the campaigner’s charge hits it can use <strong>Three Thunder Assault</strong> to allow
two allies within 10 squares of itself to charge as a free action. These charges
deal a bit of bonus thunder damage as well. Combine this with other centaurs
(maybe even other campaigners), and you have an instant massive cavalry charge!</p>

<p>Once engaged, <strong>Shock Trooper</strong> gives the campaigner a small bonus to damage
while it’s adjacent to more than one foe. It can also use a maneuver called
<strong>Hoofed Tornado</strong> to perform strong attacks on all enemies in a Close Burst 1,
knocking them prone on a hit and marking them for a turn as an effect. This
recharges when it’s first bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Centaurs might be found as members of most fey-themed encounter groups, working
alongside elves, eladrin, satyrs, and so on. I imagine the nastier sort of
centaur might also work alongside shady customers such as banshrae, hags, or
fomorians. For some of those you might want to do some level adjustment either
of the centaurs themselves or their associates.</p>

<p>If you want your party to meet centaurs early, knocking 10 levels from the
centaur hunter, ravager and mystic would be a good start, making them
early-heroic NPCs/enemies.</p>

<p>The sample encounter we get is Level 23: a centaur campaigner plus two eladrin
ghaeles of winter mounted on fell wyverns.</p>

<p>I like these centaurs! They can be either friend or foe depending on how they’re
treated, and in any case the PCs might find a way to talk to them instead of
fighting right away. They’re exactly what I look for in a NPC humanoid
species. Their stat blocks also work well at giving the impression of a people
for whom infantry tactics and cavalry tactics are the same thing.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/05/27/masterful-combat.html">Streamlined Melee Mastery for GURPS</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In GURPS, the Trained by a Master advantage allows a character to perform
martial feats on par with those seen in kung fu movies and other similar
stories. The Weapon Master advantage does basically the same in a slightly
different way. They overlap so much that I’m not sure if they were meant to
exist in the same campaign!</p>

<p>I think both advantages are fairly priced on their own, but I don’t think both
of them combined are worth 75 points. Choosing to only allow one of them in your
campaign is a fairly simple matter, but what if you want to allow both,
potentially on the same character?</p>

<p>Most of the differences between the two traits are fiddly matters of skill
coverage. Sweeping those aside leaves us with the remaining elephant in the
room, the Weapon Master damage bonus.</p>

<h2 id="elephant-examination-the-damage-bonus">Elephant Examination: The Damage Bonus</h2>

<p>In my experience, the damage bonus is the biggest game changer in the entire WM
package. Even if a Weapon Master never learns a supernatural skill and never
attacks or parries more than once per turn, they’re still going to feel like an
entirely different character from someone who has the exact same stats but lacks
the advantage. It feels a bit unfair to me that this bonus is not available to
characters that focus on unarmed strikes.</p>

<p>GURPS uses realistic assumptions as a base for its rules, and under those
assumptions a combatant with a weapon always has a big advantage over one
without. The unarmed fighter risks limb injury on every parry and strike. The
armed one has greater reach and much better damage from using swing attacks or
simply from doing a better damage type than crushing.</p>

<p>An unarmed fighter with Trained By a Master can approach that by taking other
traits… But then they’ve spent 60 points and bought a Hard combat skill to be
on par with someone who bought an Average skill and took Weapon Master (single
weapon) for 20 points.</p>

<p>I don’t feel a need to keep this “effectiveness gap” between armed and unarmed
skills when we’re dealing with a campaign that allows “mastery” advantages in
the first place.</p>

<h2 id="new-traits">New Traits</h2>

<p>My solution to the above situation is to rejigger the existing traits. The new
and altered traits below are available in any campaign that also allows both
Trained by a Master and Weapon Master.</p>

<h3 id="true-master-50-points">True Master (50 points)</h3>

<p>Through either decades of dedication or being some sort of war god, you have
mastered all forms of “archaic” combat. You gain <em>all</em> the benefits from having
both Trained by a Master and the full version of Weapon Master. Your unarmed
strikes enjoy the same damage bonus described under Weapon Master. This bonus
<em>does</em> stack with other bonuses from high striking skills and from traits like
Claws.</p>

<p>Those two advantages still exist, and represent a slightly less comprehensive
form of mastery. You can upgrade from any of them to True Master by spending the
difference between their point value and 50.</p>

<h3 id="iron-limbs-10-points">Iron Limbs (10 points)</h3>

<p>Your limbs are immune to incidental injury during unarmed combat. Enemies can’t
damage your limbs when they parry your unarmed attacks with a weapon, nor can
they switch targets and damage your limbs when you fail to parry their
attacks. You also don’t hurt yourself when hitting armored opponents with
unarmed strikes. Your limbs can still be deliberately targeted by enemy attacks,
however.</p>

<p>This trait replaces Unarmed Master, as it is basically Unarmed Master without
the damage bonus.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I like those two traits, though as of this writing I still need to actually
field-test them.</p>

<p>In campaigns that use these two new advantages, an unarmed specialist <em>can’t</em>
turn their limbs into Strikers. That’s what Unarmed Master did, and we did away
with it. IF the specialist in question happens to belong to a non-human species
that has natural Strikers, though, <em>those</em> would stack with True Master. Beware
of boxing crab-people!</p>

<p>Iron Limbs doesn’t have any prerequisites: you could buy it without having any
of the “mastery” advantages. This allows it to be used to represent an extremely
focused blessing, or a creature whose limbs are naturally hard to hurt or even
naturally made of metal.</p>

<p>Finally, if you feel 10 points for Iron Limbs is too expensive for someone who
is already a True Master, you could try rolling it into True Master at no extra
cost, and eliminating the separate Iron Limbs advantage.</p>

<p>Bullywugs first appeared in the AD&amp;D 1st Edition Fiend Folio, and featured
heavily in the D&amp;D cartoon of the 80’s.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Bullywugs are frog-people who claim they were created by the original
primordials, not by the gods, and that by living lives of cruelty and violence
they can reincarnate as slaads. They also believe the world itself hates them,
which they sense as a constant paranoid feeling that everyone is out to get
them. And indeed, nature itself seems to breathe in relief when a bullywug is
slain in combat.</p>

<p>Bullywug culture places no value in conservation: they move into an area
(preferrably a swampy one) and exhaust its resources as quickly as
possible. Anything they can’t use they might very well end up destroying. When
there’s nothing left, they might resort to cannibalism. Because of this
behavior, and possibly because of the divine curse alluded to above, bullywug
territory eventually becomes a barren and dismal echo of what it once was. By
the book, they’re typically Chaotic Evil with an Int score of 6 and speak
Primordial.</p>

<p>As I mentioned several times in the past, I’m not really a fan of Universally
Evil Humanoids, so I’d say it’s possible for there to be bullywugs who aren’t
Captain Planet villains and who can coexist more peacefully with their
neighbors. Who knows, maybe they could be the diplomatic bridge between the
humans over in the fields and the lizardfolk deeper in the swamp.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Bullywugs are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Aquatic keyword, which allows
them to breathe underwater and gives them combat bonuses while submerged. They
have ground speeds of 6 with Swamp Walk, ignoring swamp-flavored difficult
terrain. They also have Swim speeds of 4.</p>

<p>The bullywug signature abilities all come from that divine curse. <strong>Rancid Air</strong>
is an aura (2) which causes enemies to become weakened until the end of their
next turn if they spend a healing surge while inside. <strong>Nature’s Release</strong>
triggers when the bullywug is killed by a critical hit, and restores a handful
of HP to their slayer. Our theoretical non-evil froggy people would lack either
of these traits.</p>

<h3 id="bullywug-mucker">Bullywug Mucker</h3>

<p>This Level 1 Brute with 34 HP likely makes up the rank-and-file of a bullywug
force. It wields a <strong>spear</strong> in combat, and has a <strong>Bully</strong> trait that makes it
cause extra damage to prone targets.</p>

<p>It can make targets prone with <strong>Bullywug Rush</strong> (melee 1 vs. Fortitude;
recharge 5-6), a charge attack that deals more damage and knocks the target
prone. A miss here deals 3 damage to the Mucker and knocks <em>it</em> prone. I’m
starting to feel sorry for it.</p>

<h3 id="bullywug-twitcher">Bullywug Twitcher</h3>

<p>This is a Level 2 Skirmisher with 34 HP, who fights with a <strong>Javelin</strong> either in
melee or at range. Once per encounter the twitching intensifies and it can
perform a <strong>Spasmodic Hop</strong>, ending any marks on it, shifting 4 squares, and
making an enhanced javelin attack at the end that also inflicts a -4 attack
penalty on the target for a turn.</p>

<p>This power is Reliable, which means it’s not spent if the attack misses. On the
other hand, the Twitcher has no other special movement powers. So ironically, it
becomes less mobile once it lands its special attack.</p>

<h3 id="bullywug-croaker">Bullywug Croaker</h3>

<p>A weak and flabby specimen that uses its remarkably bad breath to make up for
its lack of strength. It’s a Level 3 Minion Brute that attacks with <strong>claws</strong>
and with a <strong>Foul Croak</strong> (Close Blast 2 vs. Fortitude) that does poison damage.</p>

<h3 id="bullywug-mud-lord">Bullywug Mud Lord</h3>

<p>A spellcaster that makes me think that whole business about emulating slaads
being a path to power might have some truth to it. Much smarter than the average
bullywug, mud lords often end up in leadership positions, and they have
absolutely no qualms about sacrificing their pathetic underlings to ensure their
own survival.</p>

<p>They’re Level 3 Artillery with 39 HP. Their ranged spells all cover an area, and
appear to be more vomited than cast. <strong>Fiery Croak</strong> (area burst 1 within 20
vs. Reflex) does fire and thunder damage, and <strong>Electric Reflux</strong> (close blast 3
vs. Reflex; recharge 6) does cold and lightning damage, half on a miss.</p>

<p>Neither of these attacks are selective. In fact, if they include at least one
ally in their area, <strong>Necessary Sacrifices</strong> grants the mud lord a +2 attack
bonus. Okay, this dude isn’t pathetic, he’s despicable.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>We have two here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 1: 1 bloodthorn vine, 2 croakers, 2 muckers, and a twitcher.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: A mud lord, 3 twitchers, 3 ettercap fang guards and 1 ettercap
webspinner.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s unclear whether the vine or the ettercaps are working with the bullywugs or
not. Their lore doesn’t make me think they’d work well with anyone. In fact,
they’d probably be in conflict with any other sapients who live in the same
swamp as them. If you want to set up a good old-fashioned swamp crawl where the
PC can meddle with several factions, a bullywug-goblin-kobold-lizardfolk
four-way conflict is an excellent starting point.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Beholders appeared in the first Monster Manual, and I covered them
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/27/beholder.html">here</a>. The Monster Manual 2 brings us a few more varieties, including some
that also made it into the Monster Vault.</p>

<p>Each of the three beholder varieties here gets its own bit of lore, so let’s
combine that with their numbers below.</p>

<p>As before, beholders are Aberrant Magical Beasts. They have All-Around Vision
and Darkvision, and a variable fly speed with hover capability. In general their
attacks consist of a very weak bite and a whole bunch of thematic ranged attacks
from their eye stalks and central eye. Beholder eye rays are Ranged, but don’t
provoke opportunity attacks.</p>

<h3 id="beholder-gauth">Beholder Gauth</h3>

<p>This one appeared in the Monster Vault, and so we discussed them a bit
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/27/beholder.html">here</a>. Gauths are the least of their kind, but they’re still as unpleasant
and power-hungry as any beholder. Their relative weakness means they often don’t
end up on the top of whatever evil org chart they join, and so they are
constantly scheming to rise in its ranks. They’re the most Starscream-like of
beholders.</p>

<p>Gauths also like to capitalize on the fearsome reputation of their larger
relatives, so people who don’t know better might confuse them for the more
dangerous varieties.</p>

<p>I already covered the Monster Vault version of gauths in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/27/beholder.html">post on MM1
beholders</a>. The Monster Manual 2 is pretty much identical, except it suffers
from the damage bug and has a remarkably weak bite. Just use the MV stats for
this one.</p>

<h3 id="beholder-eye-of-frost">Beholder Eye of Frost</h3>

<p>A counterpart to the MM1’s <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/27/beholder.html">Eye of Flame</a>, this is a beholder with a great
affinity for elemental ice. It prefers to dwell in very cold climates in the
world and Elemental Chaos, where it keeps company such as ice archons, frost
giants, and oni. Since eyes of frost aren’t that much stronger than these other
ice monsters, they often end up in the same narrative position as gauths,
scheming to gain the power and respect they feel is due to them.</p>

<p>Eyes of Frost are Large and have a fly speed of 6. They’re Level 14 Elite
Artillery with 222 HP. When first bloodied they coat themselves in <strong>Ice
Armor</strong>, increasing their AC and Fortitude by 2 for the remainder of the fight.</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> is super weak: 2d6 damage. You’d need to triple this to get it in
line with the new math.</p>

<p>Much more interesting are the eye beams. The <strong>Central Eye</strong> (Ranged 8
vs. Reflex; minor action 1/round) weakens on a hit (save ends). If a target
weakened by this power would become slowed, they become immobilized instead, and
this lasts until they’re no longer weakened!</p>

<p>The Eye of Frost has access to 3 <strong>Eye Rays</strong>, and <strong>Eyes of the Beholder</strong>
allows it to use one of them as a free action against any enemy that starts its
turn within 5 squares of the beholder. That enemy also gains Vulnerable 5 Cold
until the end of the beholder’s next turn. A ray attack can also be done with a
standard action, of course, further increasing the beholder’s rate of fire.</p>

<p>The rays have Range 10, and have the following effects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Freeze Ray</strong>: vs. Fortitude, deals cold damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Telekinesis</strong>: vs. Fortitude, slides 6 squares.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ice Ray</strong>: vs. Fortitude, deals less cold damage than the freeze ray but
also deals ongoing cold damage and immobilizes (save ends both).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Cold resistance on the PCs will go a long way towards making the eye of frost
less dangerous, though its control effects will still be a problem.</p>

<h3 id="beholder-eye-of-chaos">Beholder Eye of Chaos</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a beholder <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/27/beholder.html">Eye Tyrant</a> who dove into the Abyss
in search of the Shard of Ultimate Evil wielded by Tharizdun. Though the
creature never found the shard, it nevertheless emerged from the experience
infused with all sorts of demonic energies, which increased its power and warped
its body and mind. This stat block could represent that individual or one of its
descendants, or perhaps another beholder who thought he could do it better.</p>

<p>Eyes of Chaos are still quite capable of concocting complex schemes and
directing armies of underlings… only now those underlings tend to be demons
more often than not, and those schemes end up having widespread destruction and
bloodshed as either their main goals or as desirable side effects.</p>

<p>This twisted thing is Large, and Level 25 Elite Artillery. It has a pretty
impressive fly speed of 8, which makes it a lot zoomier than your average
beholder.</p>

<p>The <strong>bite</strong> is once again nothing to write home about, despite all those lovely
teeth. The <strong>Central Eye</strong> (Ranged 20 vs. Fortitude) has the traditional
antimagic/enervation effect that forbits the target from using encounter or
daily powers until the end of the beholder’s next turn.</p>

<p>After that we get the six <strong>eye rays</strong>, all Ranged 10:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Telekinesis</strong>: vs. Fortitude, does physical damage and slides 6 squares.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blinding</strong>: vs. Reflex, does physical damage and blinds (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Confounding</strong>: vs. Will, does psychic damage, slides 6 squares, and dazes
(save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Maddening</strong>: vs. Will, does psychic damage and dominates until the end of
the beholder’s next turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fear</strong>: vs. Will, does psychic damage and forces the target to move its
speed away from the beholder by the safest route possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Teleporting</strong>: vs. Reflex, does physical damage and teleports 10 squares.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The usual <strong>Eyes of the Beholder</strong> trait means anyone starting their turn within
5 squares of the beholder gets hit with a random eye ray. When the monster is
first bloodied it releases a <strong>Ripple of Chaos</strong> that allows it to target every
enemy within 5 squares with a random eye ray and then teleport 6 squares.</p>

<p>I kinda want to make a random roll even for the standard-action eye rays with
this critter. For all the randomness, though, it seems the eye ray effects are
actually a bit less exciting than those of a “normal” beholder, since there are
no sudden death effects here.</p>

<h3 id="beholder-ultimate-tyrant">Beholder Ultimate Tyrant</h3>

<figure class="right">

<p>If you manage to talk to the Ultimate Tyrant, it will tell you that it has the
most valid of reasons for hating all other beholders: they’re a bunch of
posers. They were born in the world or otherwise went native, but the Ultimate
Tyrant is part of the original generation that came directly from the Far Realm
and still keeps its connection to that place.</p>

<p>Depending on the particulars of your campaign it might even be <em>the</em> original
beholder. If not, it’s at least among the first to arrive in the world. Perhaps
the only creature that might dispute its claims of OG-ness is the Gibbering Orb.</p>

<p>The Ultimate Tyrant is Huge, and a Level 29 Solo Artillary menace with 1080
HP. This can even make it suitable as a final boss for a campaign that ends in
the mid-epic levels. Its fly speed is 8, again making it a lot faster than the
MM1 beholders. The damage for all of this beholder’s attacks is quite low, and
should likely be at least doubled.</p>

<p>There’s the basic <strong>bite</strong>, and there’s the stuff you’ll actually be using. The
<strong>Central Eye</strong> (Ranged 30 vs. Fortitude; minor action 1/round) does no damage
but dazes and slows on a hit (save ends both). This worsens to a full Stun on
the first failed save. A miss still slows the target (save ends).</p>

<p><strong>Eyes of the Beholder</strong> works as usual, and <strong>Spasmodic Rays</strong> makes it so the
beholder attacks every enemy within 10 squares with an eye ray when it’s first
bloodied and again when it dies.</p>

<p>The <strong>eye rays</strong> themselves are quite scary. Instead of simple ranged attacks,
all of them are Area Burst 1 Within 10, and they still don’t provoke opportunity
attacks. If the standard Eye Tyrant is a slow-moving battleship, the Ultimate
Tyrant is a hyper-mobile orbital laser cannon.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Madness</strong>: vs. Will; does psychic damage and forces the target to make a
basic attack against its nearest ally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Unraveling</strong>: vs. Fortitude; does physical damage and 10 ongoing damage
(save ends). The first failed save causes an additional 1d10 damage; the
second an additional 2d10; the third causes an additional 3d10 and
automatically ends the effect. So if you fail all of your saves, you’ll be
taking a total of 6d10+30 damage over those three turns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Withering</strong>: vs. Fortitude. Does immediate and ongoing necrotic damage
(save ends), with the first failed save also weakening the target. There’s a
(save ends) after the weakening effect, so I’m guessing that’s a separate
save from the ongoing damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Burning</strong>: vs. Reflex. Does immediate and ongoing fire damage, and also
inflicts a -2 attack penalty (save ends both).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Telekinesis</strong>: vs. Fortitude. Slides the target 8 squares and knocks it
prone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Frost</strong>: vs. Reflex. Cold damage, and a -2 penalty to saves until the end
of the beholder’s next turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Petrifying</strong>: vs. Fortitude. Causes slowness (save ends), which worsens to
immobilization (save ends) with the first failed save and with petrification
with the second. Petrification is permanent until cured.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Disintegrate</strong>: vs. Fortitude. Physical damage, and ongoing 15 physical
damage (save ends). There’s also an ongoing 10 damage after-effect, so in
practice passing that first save only reduces the ongoing damage a bit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Attraction</strong>: vs. Reflex; -5 penalty to all defenses, and at the start of
the target’s turn the beholder pulls it 2 squares (save ends). There’s also a
-2 penalty to defenses as an after-effect (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Repulsion</strong>: vs. Reflex. -2 penalty to Reflex, and at the start of the
target’s turn the beholder pushes it 6 squares (save ends). As an after
effect, the target gets pushed 3 squares in the same way (save
ends).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Though the Ultimate Tyrant only has one outright deadly effect among its ray
selection, it has a few other very interesting effects: the increasing ongoing
damage from the Unraveling Ray, the extra-sticky ongoing damage from
Disintegrate, and the first instances I’ve seen of ongoing forced movement!</p>

<p>It bears repeating that <em>all of these are area attacks</em>. Yes, even the
free-action ones from Eye of the Beholder and Spasmodic Ray. This thing is an
army-killer.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get a total of four sample encounters here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: A gauth, 2 barghest savagers, and a goblin underboss. The gauth is
likely the leader here, making the goblins think it’s a fully powered
beholder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: An Eye of Frost, an oni mage and two wyverns. What haunts the cold
mountain at night.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 24: An Eye of Chaos and a Chaos Hydra. That enough chaos for you?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 29: The Ultimate Tyrant and 2 Slaughterstone Hammerers. What if the
kaiju teamed up with the giant robots?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I love beholders and it’s always good to have more. The Eye of Frost feels
weirdly limited in what it can do, like is fiery counterpart in the first MM,
but the Ultimate Tyrant is an absolute unit.</p>
