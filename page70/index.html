<p>As I mentioned back in the post about my <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/02/08/x-com-setup.html">campaign setup</a> on this game, I
can’t post adaptations of the Dreams of Ruin creatures here without violating
the book’s license. What I <em>can</em> do, however, is post stats for their gear in
this campaign, since it’s different from what’s in the original book. Today,
we’ll focus on the Puppets of Ruin, which are the only alien the group met in
their first operation that actually uses gear.</p>

<p>Original-flavor Puppets of Ruin carry magic swords, bolt-action rifles,
concussion hand grenades, and ocasionally a RPG launcher. That’s a terrifying
loadout for anyone in the medieval fantasy worlds they’re meant to attack! With
this equipment, and at 3 Hit Dice, they’re supposed to be superior to any
conventional force of 1 HD soldiers or even 2 HD humanoids. That would be even
truer in a GURPS campaign, where they’re taking TL 7 weapons into a TL 3
world. Even powerful adventurers wouldn’t be able to face them head-on!</p>

<p>However, in <em>this</em> campaign they’re attacking a late TL8 world, which means
their original equipment would actually be <em>less advanced</em> than what’s typically
available to an outfit like X-COM! That feels wrong to me - it’s not a proper
X-COM game unless even the “weakest” alien has a technological edge over your
soldiers. Therefore, I decided they needed an upgrade. And now, for the first
time, I’m publishing stats for their weapons:</p>

<h2 id="puppet-gear">Puppet Gear</h2>

<p>These weapons and their corresponding ammunition are <em>grown</em> by the Body Trees
rather than manufactured. Their construction and functionality is equivalent to
Tech Level 9. They tend to have a curvy, organic look, with no unecessary
seams. Each individual item is slightly different from all others, though
ammunition for a specific weapon will always fit another weapon of the same
type.</p>

<p>Weapon stats are all as described in the <strong>Basic Set</strong>, with two exceptions.
Weight is in <em>kilograms</em>, not pounds, because I like the metric system more; and
monetary cost is not listed, because I didn’t use it in the campaign
itself. Filling a cost in shouldn’t be too hard for those GMs that want it, and
to figure out an item’s weight in pounds just multiply the listed numbers by 2.</p>

<p>These days, I prefer to use the alternate Guns specialties presented in
<strong>Pyramid #3/65: Alternate GURPS III</strong>. I did so in the campaign itself, and I
do so in this article, though I also note what <strong>Basic Set</strong> skills the weapons
require.</p>

<h3 id="puppet-sword">Puppet Sword</h3>

<p>Around 1 meter long, this sword has a straight double-edged blade made of a
ceramic/metal composite material and a substantial handguard similar to that of
a cavalry saber. As puppets are more proficient in melee combat than just about
any typical modern soldier, this is probably their most dangerous weapon if they
happen to be within easy reach of their targets.</p>

<p>Treat this as a Superfine (p. UT163) backsword (p. MA227 or LT66). It’s used
with the Broadsword skill. All puppets have one.</p>

<h3 id="puppet-rifle">Puppet Rifle</h3>

<p>This is a short, semi-automatic carbine firing caseless 7.77mm rounds with an
Electrothermal-Chemical (ETC) action. It contains no targetting electronics, but
the puppets’ own senses and link with the forest more than compensate for
this. It’s made from the same materials as the sword and self-cleaning,
requiring no regular maintenance. It’s extremely reliable and won’t malfunction
unless some external factor lowers its Malf.</p>

<p>The Puppet Rifle is fired with Guns (Longarm), or Guns (Rifle) if using the
Basic Set skills. All puppets have a fully loaded rifle plus 3 or 4 extra
magazines. The Trees of Woe bear extra reloads as fruit, so they can resupply if
they have access to a thicket.</p>

<h3 id="puppet-grenade">Puppet Grenade</h3>

<p>This is a concussion grenade with an advanced plastic explosive filling and a
soft outer shell that limits fragmentation. It’s used with Throwing, and every
puppet carries from 1 to 3. These also grow from the Trees of Woe, so puppets
near a thicket will be profiligate in their use.</p>

<p>The Puppet Grenade is essentially a TL 9 HEC hand grenade (p. UT146 and UT154).</p>

<h3 id="puppet-rpg">Puppet RPG</h3>

<p>This weapon is a thin launch tube with handles and iron sights, firing a 77mm
over-caliber warhead which vaguely resembles a RPG-7 round. It takes 3 seconds
to set up. While launchers and their ammo are also provided by the forest, they
appear at a slower rate, and only where the Trees of Woe are at their
densest. Only about 1 in 7 puppets has a launcher, and will typically carry from
1 to 3 rounds for it. Its squad mates might carry extra rounds as well.</p>

<p>The launcher has a hazardous backblast that causes 2d burning damage. It uses
Guns (LAW), which has the same name in both skill systems.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-arsenal-of-ruin">Using the Arsenal of Ruin</h2>

<p>These weapons have other campaign roles aside from equipping the Puppets of
Ruin! They occupy the same niche as lasers in the original X-COM or magnetic
weapons in the 2015 XCOM 2, using technology that’s a step up from what’s
initially available to human soldiers but not as good as what the alien
masterminds have at their disposal.</p>

<p>Unlike the alien weapons from the X-COM computer games, they can be easily
operated by humans and contain no biometric locks, self-destruct failsafes or
anything of the sort. Someone who came across one of them lying on the floor
could just pick it up and use it, assuming they had the appropriate
skills.</p>

<p>This is by design! The Forest <em>wants</em> people to commit violence within its
borders, and is only too happy to provide them with the tools to do so. Any
local Servants of Ruin drawn to its borders will soon find themselves
well-supplied with these weapons, and possibly in command of a puppet
posse. Even people who aren’t quite as evil might be gifted with weapons as a
temptation. They are also chock-full of spores, so taking them beyond the
forest’s borders aids the spread of the Dreams.</p>

<p>A chimera is nightmarish three-headed beast whose appearance in Gransys heralds
the coming of the Dragon. It resembles a huge lion with a giant goat’s head
growing out of its back and a monstrous snake in place of its tail. All three
heads are extremely dangerous! Both the lion and the snake have very strong
bites and have large enough jaws to grapple human-sized targets, with the snake
being venomous as well. And while the goat doesn’t have a large range of motion,
it can <em>cast spells</em>. This last fact is very often the last surprise any who
dare face the chimera have in their lives, and is a sign that the monster is a
lot more intelligent than its animalistic appearance would indicate. In addition
to all of this, all three heads can act independently at the same time.</p>

<p>As heralds to the Dragon, chimerae guard the path to it, making their lairs in
places one must cross to arrive at the Dragon’s chosen nest. They can also
sometimes be found near lesser dragons as well.</p>

<p>GMs who use chimerae in their games are also encouraged to
include <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/24/snake-maned-lion.html">Snake-Maned Lions</a> as either a variant chimera or a related
monster. You can never have too many freakish mutant lions in your game!</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Immune to Animal spells, but susceptible to Mind Control spells. The
Chimera may attack with all three natural weapons <em>and</em> cast a spell during each
of its turns.</p>

<h2 id="fighting-the-chimera">Fighting the Chimera</h2>

<p>Chimerae like to incapacitate targets either by grappling them with one of their
biting heads, or by magically dazing them or putting them to sleep. They will
then proceed to tear the helpless victim apart with their teeth and
claws. Despite its size, the monster is fairly mobile and smart enough to try
and avoid being surrounded. It’s most vulnerable to long-ranged attacks, but
it’s also smart enough to be aware of this! When faced with a large group of
opponents, a chimera might try to drag them away one at a time.</p>

<p>A chimera’s lion and goat heads can be incapacitaded by a single attack doing
over 12 HP of injury (as if they were limbs). They each have all the hit
locations you’d expect of a head: neck, face, eyes, brain. These can be targeted
at the usual penalties. Killing a head prevents the chimera from performing the
actions associated with that head. The lion head is the beast’s main head - it
dies when the whole creature dies.</p>

<h2 id="chimera-variants">Chimera Variants:</h2>

<p>The same variants described in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/24/snake-maned-lion.html">Snake-Maned Lion</a> article are appropriate
here, with the exception of <em>Intelligent</em> (which already applies to all
chimerae).  <em>Gorechimerae</em> are not only both <em>Armored</em> and <em>Demonic</em>, they also
know more spells and have higher combat skills! No one has seen one of these in
Gransys - the laws of nature would need to be completly broken for such a beast
to cross the Rift.</p>

<p>Looks like my <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017-03-28-psi-wars-golko.md">nascent Psi Wars campaign</a> has gathered attention from the
highest of circles, by which I
mean <a href="https://mailanka.blogspot.com.br/2017/03/a-psi-wars-round-up.html">Mailanka himself is following the game</a>. So hey, no pressure.</p>

<p>I only noticed the above post today, since I was a bit behind on my RSS
reading. It contains a very detailed summary of my recruitment/character
creation thread, with links to relevant posts and an analysis of some of my
campaign decisions. That’s a better summary than I could have written myself, so
go read it! I’ll use this post to provide some additional context on my
decisions.</p>

<p>First of all, a small nitpick: It’s “Bira’s Octopus Carnival” :). Bliss
Authority was indeed the one who had the idea for a Psi Wars game on the RPG.net
forums, but the blog is mine. It’s all good, though! Let’s move on to the good
stuff:</p>

<h2 id="on-communion">On Communion</h2>

<p>Mailanka comments about my stated view that True Communion is good, and Broken
and Dark Communion are bad. Indeed, I know that things were meant to be more
ambiguous than that in the Psi Wars text, but this is my first time actually
<em>using</em> the material! I wanted to keep things simple both for myself and for any
players who weren’t familiar with Psi Wars as its own thing.</p>

<p>So, for this specific campaign, I adopted a stance more closely aligned with
that of Star Wars itself. A game more focused on exploring Communion would
certainly benefit from the more neutral view.</p>

<p>There was also the more practical reason that it looked like we were headed
towards a party which included followers of conflicting Paths, and I wanted to
avoid that in the first game. This ended up not happening, as no one spent
points in Communion to start. Jatuu the former gladiator might still end up
going either True or Dark in the future, if the game lasts long enough.</p>

<h2 id="robots-and-cyborgs">Robots and Cyborgs</h2>

<p>I denied lordmcdeath’s wish to play “a robot who pretends he’s a cyborg” for a
couple of reasons, the main one being that I wanted to limit the amount of
template surgery in this particular game. There are no ready-made racial
templates for PC-level robots, and while something could be arranged by taking
the base Android template and tweaking it into a usable racial template, the
ensuing discussion would have added more time to the already lengthy
play-by-forum character creation process. Reality Glitch’s character had already
gone through an extensive round of such discussion, and they ended up leaving
the game.</p>

<p>Mailanka’s discussion on whether it’s thematically appropriate to have robots
pass themselves off as organic is another reason why I disallowed it for this
game - it’s not a theme I wanted to focus on.</p>

<p>That said, I might end up working on a “playable robot” racial template to post
here in Octopus Carnival, possibly even with an “organic disguise” lens. Just
because I’m not focusing on that in my current campaign doesn’t mean I don’t
like the concept!</p>

<h2 id="in-closing">In Closing…</h2>

<p>I’m very happy to see this game has been noticed by the setting’s author and I
hope I don’t disappoint in my execution :). If you’re interested in following
the game as it happens, the out-of-character thread is <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?800200-GURPS-Psi-Wars-Golko-Wants-You-Dead!">here</a> and the
in-character thread is <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?800803-Psi-Wars-Golko-Wants-You-Dead!">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next up: Golko himself!</p>

<p>Welcome to another installment on
my <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">GURPS X-COM: Noises in the Dark campaign report</a>! This is the final
installment of Operation BRUTAL ADVENT, our group’s inaugural mission. The
following PCs participated in it:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kendall Fairbarn</strong>: A paranoid hacker from the UK. Was completely convinced
human society had been heavily infiltrated by shape-changing aliens… and it
turned out he wasn’t entirely wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Minette Duvall</strong>: A bomb-disposal expert from Southern France, Minette is
also quite handy with a rifle. She’s devoutly Catholic and swears a lot when
faced with danger, which is all the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Niu Yulan (AKA Julia Yulan)</strong>: A former hostage negotiatior from China.
Julia is pretty handy with a rifle but her medical training and innate
kindness are equally important parts of her arsenal.</li>
  <li><strong>Jack Choi</strong>: A former police detective from Hong Kong, and a staunch
adherent of the “kick down the door” school of policing despite his light
frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following NPCs also had important roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Valenkov</strong> and <strong>Gutierrez</strong>: A pair of shooters from Russia and Argentina,
respectively, both members of the squad who lost their players just before the
start of the mission.</li>
  <li><strong>Yevgeny Korsakov</strong>: The pilot of the squad’s Skyranger transport.</li>
  <li><strong>Jan Wiest</strong>: A cop stuck in the anomaly zone. Together with his unit, he’s
been fighting the aliens for months.</li>
  <li><strong>Gisela Vahlen and company</strong>: Seven civilians inhabiting a building inside
the anomaly zone. Three of them are relatives of Dr. Vahlen, one of X-COM’s
top scientists.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="recovery-and-planning">Recovery and Planning</h2>

<p>The party had just survived their first <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/03/05/brutal-advent-part-2.html">encounter with a Bakegumo</a>, and was
still reeling a bit from the experience. Choi, in particular, had been hit quite
hard by the hand-like alien, whom they decided to call “Rosie”. At least
Korsakov was recovered from whatever mind control he was under, and quickly
loaded the civilians up into the Skyranger, taking off to safety once that was
done.</p>

<p>Julia stepped up to apply first aid to Choi’s wound, which probably included at
least one broken rib. She opened up her crash kit and noticed with much
consternation that any drug it contained that was more advanced than rubbing
alcohol had turned into some sort of foul black sludge. Pills, liquids, even
the stuff applied to hemostatic bandages, all gone bad. The kit had been
effectively reduced to TL 6 in terms of effectiveness! She was still able to
restore some of Choi’s lost HP, but it took longer than it otherwise would.</p>

<p>After this is done, they get to planning. From everything they know so far, the
“distortion field” is preventing German authorities from noticing what’s going
on in the affected zone. The squad decides taking this field out is their best
bet. Judging from the shape of the effect, they figure the source is in a
building just south of the hospital’s parking lot. There’s no telling on which
floor it is, though.</p>

<p>Jan Wiest, the cop, tells them his buddies have been working on a reckless plan
to assault the hospital. They’ve managed to get an old Toyota Hilux truck
working, and have loaded it up with anything even remotely incendiary or
explosive they could get their hands on. The plan is to send the vehicle
careening towards the northwest corner of the hospital as the opening move of an
all-in assault. They’ve clearly given this some thought, and this is the first
real opportunity to put the plan into action - the flashy assault should provide
the PCs with the distraction they need to go in through the opposite corner.</p>

<h2 id="infiltration-and-engagement">Infiltration and Engagement</h2>

<p>The PCs agree with the plan, with Valenkov and Gutierrez choosing to lend their
firepower to the distraction assault. Everyone gets into position, and as the
squad hears the distant explosions begin, they move in on the building from the
southwest corner. That section of the hospital is walled off, but the wall
happens to have a convenient, sturdy fuse box that can serve as a stepping
stone, and provides easy access to a second-floor window.</p>

<p>The hospital looks even more dilapidated than the other buildings in the
neighborhood, as it has been shot at more often. All the windows above the
ground floor are broken. Every bit of the outer walls that hasn’t yet been
covered in bullet holes is instead covered in runic-looking graffiti. As they
enter through the window, the party notices the interior of the hospital doesn’t
look much better. Paint has peeled or been torn off from the walls in places,
and the same graffiti is everywhere. All the lights are out, most of them
broken. The air feels dusty, and smells faintly of rot.</p>

<p>Choi rolls an unprimed grenade down the hallway, but nothing unusual
happens. Kendall has a harder time getting accurate readings from his sensors in
here - his chemsniffers, for example, report the air as being composed of 100%
hydrochloric acid. Still, he manages to pinpoint the source of the anomaly. It’s
somewhere below them in the hospital’s Geriatrics ward, which they can reach by
proceeding down this hallway. They cautiously move on.</p>

<p>In a minute they reach the stairwell and elevator. The sounds of fighting
outside are beginning to die down. Since the source is below them, they figure
the best place to put it would be all the way down in the hospital’s extensive
basement.</p>

<p>Minette looks at the elevator and at the stairs, and has an idea: set up a bomb
inside the elevator and send it down to the basement, and then assault the place
through the stairs once the explosive goes off. This would turn any possible
ambush the aliens are preparing against them. The elevator comes from a higher
floor when called. Its light panels have been torn off and its walls covered in
graffiti. Minette sets up a proximity mine built from one of Choi’s grenades and
an optical sensor Kendall got from a nearby automatic door.</p>

<p>They send the elevator down… and it blow up too early, with a much stronger
force than they anticipated. The blast climbs up the shaft with enough force to
buckle the doors on their floor. Looks like the aliens had prepared a little
surprise of their own at the basement! The squad quickly recovers from the
surprise and proceeds with their original plan, running down the stairs.</p>

<p>As soon as they emerge in a dark basement room, they begin trading shots with
the aliens down there. There are four of them, firing from rooms adjacent to the
box-filled space the party emerged into, wearing black military uniforms and
eyeless gas masks. Despite the lack of eyeholes, they can apparently see pretty
well in the eerie blue-green light suffusing the basement.</p>

<p>The fight is short but intense. Minette shoots two of the enemies early, while
Choi tries to flush another out of cover with more frag grenades. Instead of
running away, the alien draws a sword and rushes Choi! He and Kendall spend a
few tense seconds in melee combat before while Minette deals with the remaining
shooter, and are finally able to back away and shoot the last enemy.</p>

<p>With the fight over, they can assess their surroundings in more detail. They’re
in a storage area filled with boxes containing medication and assorted medical
equipment. Every box that was hit by a stray bullet or sword blow is leaking the
same black sludge found in Julia’s medkit. The green-blue light comes from some
sort of fluorescent mold that clings to the walls. The air feels musty and
heavy, and everything is covered in a thin layer of red dust.</p>

<p>As for the aliens, once unmasked, they look like faceless wooden puppets. Their
“skin” feels like some kind of dark wood, though the blood from their wounds
hints at fleshier interiors. Their weapons are single-shot rifles with a
strange, curvy design and no ejection ports. They did sound like they fired
solid ammo, though. The party decides to move on rather than speculating about
the alien bodies. Leave that to the scientists.</p>

<h2 id="the-anomaly">The Anomaly</h2>

<p>The eastern door out of the room opens into a wide corridor extending from south
to north. Kendall’s sensors indicate the anomaly’s epicenter is north, so they
go that way. The way is littered with scattered furniture and with larger and
larger alien fungal growths, some of which quiver when the soldiers pass near
them. The dust thickens as well.</p>

<p>They <em>almost</em> miss the minefield, but Minette notices it at the last
instant. The devices seem to be made of a white material similar to fiberglass,
but their form factor simply screams mine. There were six, all placed in such a
way that the hallway’s clutter would block line of sight to them. Now that they
know where the mines are, the squad can carefully walk past them. Running
through this area would still pose a hazard, though. After some deliberation,
they decide to push some of the hallway’s furniture into the adjoining empty
rooms before proceeding, to make a future retreat through this area easier.</p>

<p>When they finish, they can hear shuffling and crashing sounds coming from a door
at the northern end of the corridor. Sounds like someone is getting ready to
flee in a hurry. They quickly move up, checking the adjoining rooms for
hostiles, and finally arrive at the source of the noise - and of the anomaly.</p>

<p>This is a large room where all of the hospital’s remaining lab equipment and
computers were moved and set up atop a ring of heavy metal desks in the room’s
center. Most of it is wrecked when the PCs arrive. Two of the soldier aliens and
a Bakegumo seem to be busy destroying everything, supervised by something that
looks like a pillar of black smoke with embers for eyes. Something lashes out of
the smoke, causing the PCs to feel as if the ve/</p>

<p>/ry ai/</p>

<p>/r was cut. It steps into the resulting rent in space, and it closes behind it,
returning the world to normal. Time for another firefight!</p>

<p>The Bakegumo turns to Minette, and begins doing a strange “dance”. She begins to
hear the distant sounds of drums and brass cymbals, and the edges of her vision
begins to crawl. Minette gets off a long burst, but the alien seems to ignore it
as she begins to feel her own sins crawling on her back. A bullet from one of
the puppets hits her vest, and the pain snaps her out of it, allowing her to
finish the “Rosie” off.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kendall triggers another feedback look, trying to flood the alien
communications channel with an amplified version of the eerie chatter he
recorded earlier. It’s enough to confuse them for a second, hurting their
accuracy enough that Choi and Julia are able to deal with the pair. With that,
there are no more hostiles in the room.</p>

<p>Julia takes the time to apply first aid to Minette, and just as she finishes
everyone notices the <em>trees</em>. A clump of five or so, all together at the center
of the ring of desks. Black trunks, black leaves, black branches heavy with fat
white fruit the squad recognizes as the <em>mines</em> from earlier in the
hallway. They reach to the ceiling. This is the first time they are noticed, but
upon looking at them the squad knows they’ve been there the whole time.</p>

<p>Spooked, the PCs decide to blow the trees up using the hallway mines and their
last grenade, thrown from outside the room. The resulting blast is devastating,
and as soon as the trees are gone the whole distortion field clears. A pressure
they didn’t know they were under lifts from their minds. With the interference
gone, Wiest is able to reach them by radio and inform that the assault force
managed to take out all the remaining alien soldiers, but they lost a few men
and Valenkov and Gutierrez were gravely wounded.</p>

<h2 id="denouement">Denouement</h2>

<p>Later on, the squad manages to reach HQ and discover that a second Skyranger is
on the way, called in by Korsakov, with a full cleanup crew. Over the next few
days, they direct the local authorities and collect everything from the area
that even looks alien. The civilians still living there are relocated by the
German government, with the exception of Gisela’s family who, at Dr. Vahlen’s
insistence, was moved to Mother Base. Hans, Gisela’s father, joins X-COM as an
engineer.</p>

<p>Despite casualties, the mission was a success, reassuring the Council of X-COM’s
effectiveness.</p>

<p>The new enemy they fought here were the Puppets of Ruin, depicted above. Named
“Pinocchios” by the group, these are the main front line troops of the
Dreams. They combine excellent military training (both modern and archaic) with
a total lack of compassion and a willingness to serve anyone who displays the
right mix of cruelty and strength. The ones you see above are in their “natural”
state - for this campaign, I decided that anyone who enlisted puppet units would
give them their own uniforms, hence the black fatigues with eyeless gas masks.</p>

<p>The originals are meant to terrorize medieval fantasy worlds, and carry the
equivalent of TL 7 military gear. Mine carry TL 9 equipment, which I will detail
in a future post.</p>

<p>The “pillar of smoke” alien was an addition of my own. It was meant to replace
the Night Hags from the Dreams of Ruin sourcebook, though at the time I didn’t
know what was going to be behind the smokescreen.</p>

<p>While the puppets are good shooters and would be unholy terrors when pitted
against 150-point soldiers, the more powerful X-COM squad was rather better at
dealing with them. The hardest part for them was dealing with the puppets’
<em>melee</em> proficiency, as none of the PCs put many points in close combat and none
of them had a weapon that could really stand up to the alien swords. No one
suffered damage from them, but it was more due to luck than skill or sound
tactics.</p>

<p>The same can’t be said of the elevator trap or the minefield, though - success
there was entirely due to character skill and player ingenuity. Had the party
blithely taken the elevator down, it would have resulted in a TPK, as the bottom
of the shaft was lined with mines.</p>

<p>I’ve been following the creation of the Psi-Wars setting
on <a href="https://mailanka.blogspot.com">Mailanka’s Musings</a> with great interest, and it’s no secret that this
project was one of the inspirations for me to start my own blog. In fact, as I
write this I am also in the process of starting up a short Psi-Wars game on
RPG.net! Someone else proposed the game, and I stepped up to GM it.</p>

<p>The setup is going to be something I saw used long ago for a Star Wars one-shot
using Wushu: there’s this crime lord named Golko, and he wants all the PCs dead
for some reason. Their only hope is to team up and take Golko down. In addition
to creating a character as normal, each player has to both state the reason
Golko wants their PC dead, and tell me one true thing about Golko. In other
words, they collaborate to create the adventure’s antagonist.</p>

<p>Our PCs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Jatuu Harhlohuan</strong>, a Felinoid and former arena slave turned
Psi-Knight. Only time will tell if she will follow the path of True Communion
or fall to the lure of its Dark side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lady Maya Afolayan</strong>, a noble-born Fighter Ace who pretends to run her
family’s shipping concern while looking for wrongs to right in the Galactic
Rim.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Captain Scarlet Crimson</strong> of the Crimson Corsair, a space pirate with a
heart of gold and a quirky robot crew.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Paul “Patch” Patterson</strong>, Scarlet’s chief engineer, who can deal with
technology using both mundane skills and psionic powers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The other important character in this story is <strong>Golko</strong>, of course. Not all
players have posted the required answers, but so far he’s turning out to be a
nasty piece of work. I’ll post his description when I have all the information I
need.</p>
