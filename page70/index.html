<p>In the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/13/characters.html">last post</a> I described how most of the templates from <strong>GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy 1: Adventurers</strong> would fit into the Dragon’s Dogma setting. This
included saying something about its spellcasters, and while the treatment given
to them there is minimally sufficient to help you create such a character I feel
I need to expand a bit on the magic system used in the campaign.</p>

<p>As said in the previous article, the magic system in the original game bears
enough similarities to the Spell Magic system from <strong>GURPS Magic</strong> that we can
use it in this campaign with some but not all of the modifications made to it by
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>.</p>

<p>In this article I describe that system in full. This will lay the necessary
groundwork for us to fill in the missing detail for Part 1’s magic-using
templates, and to discuss the hybrid templates in Part 3 in full.</p>

<h2 id="spells-and-magic-in-gransys">Spells and Magic in Gransys</h2>

<p>All spellcasters in this setting have Magery and use Wizardly spells. Like
Wizards in <strong>DF 1</strong>, they <em>do</em> have to learn prerequisites and <em>don’t</em> have
limited spell lists. Unlike default Wizards, they <em>do</em> have access to Healing,
Animal, Plant and Weather spells, since there are no other sources of magic to
provide them. Magery <em>can</em> be gained through study and ritual, so it can be
acquired and improved with earned character points after character creation.</p>

<p>Enchantment spells are still off-limits to PCs. Here, they are the province of
NPC artisans and armorers, the best of which have very idiosyncratic
personalities and are loathe to share their secrets with anyone.</p>

<p>Teleportation and time manipulation spells also remain off-limits. There are
some magic items that deal with that kind of stuff, however. We’ll get to them
when we cover equipment.</p>

<p>Spells to resurrect or reincarnate the dead are off-limits in this particular
setting! This is still possible with the use of certain rare artifacts, but not
even the most powerful magician can learn how to do it at will.</p>

<p>All other <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> changes to wizardly spells remain in effect.</p>

<h2 id="arcane-powers-and-power-ups">Arcane Powers and Power-Ups</h2>

<p>Something we didn’t specifically address in our discussion of Clerics and Druids
in Part 1 was what to do with the 20 points each has allocated to “Divine” and
“Druidic” abilities. In <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>, those come from an explicit
connection to nature or to a deity, and both the set of available abilities and
their power modifiers reflect that. Since this isn’t true in the Dragon’s Dogma
setting, we have to find an alternate use for those points.</p>

<p>While spells should remain the main expression of magic, there is room for
something more. Little things that are always active, or even consciously
activated abilities that don’t quite follow spell mechanics. This description
applies pretty well to the existing Power-Ups from <strong>DF 11</strong>, so our list of
arcane powers will kinda blur into that. In effect, the following power/list of
power-ups is available to all spellcasting characters in the setting.</p>

<h3 id="archmagic">Archmagic</h3>

<p>Characters who advance their study of magic past a certain point discover a set
of secrets of the profession that manifest differently from traditional
spells. These are known as “Archmagics” (or “Archmagicks” in Gransys’ preferred
spelling) and are represented by the following powers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Energy Reserve (Magical) 1-20 {3/level}.</li>
  <li>Magic Resistance (Improved, +150%) {5/level} with <em>no</em> upper limit.</li>
  <li>The Inextinguishable Power and Magical Bolt power-ups from <strong>DF 11</strong>.</li>
  <li>All the General Caster Power-Ups from <strong>DF 11</strong>, including Familiars (which
are generally elemental beings and known as “Magic Agents”) and Perks.</li>
  <li>The Storms from <strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 26-27, with the addition of the Selective
Area (+20%) enhancement. This increases their cost to 42 points each.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>Cleric</em> and <em>Druid</em> templates have 20 points reserved for magical abilities
that can be used for these or for additional spells. The <em>Wizard</em> template may
use any of its 30 discretionary advantage points for them.</p>

<h2 id="more-magic">More Magic?</h2>

<p>In Part 3 we will get into Hybrid Vocations (and thus, Hybrid Templates), which
have some unique magic tricks in the original game. We’ll cover these there.</p>

            <p><strong>Update</strong>: This is the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy version of the character. If you

<p>Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder’s Iconic Characters to
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>! This is the third post in the series. Previous
entries can be found here:</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Cleric, which means today’s
star is Kyra. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Kyra.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can find her full bio <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Kyra">here</a>, and her original Pathfinder
stats <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/kyra.html">here</a>. From looking at them we can see the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Kyra is from Qadira, her world’s Persia/Arabia equivalent. She’s the sole
survivor from a bandit raid on her farming village.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kyra is a cleric of <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Sarenrae">Sarenrae</a>, the goddess of healing, redemption,
honesty, and the sun. She teaches her devotees to always seek to redeem those
who follow the path of evil, and to destroy them if that proves impossible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wields a scimitar, her deity’s favored weapon. Her cleric spells generally
have a “light, fire and healing” theme, and she possesses the typical D&amp;D
cleric ability to turn undead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Given Sarenrae’s portfolio, we could represent Kyra with the just the base
Cleric template from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 1: Adventurers</strong>… but the Sun
Priest lens from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 7: Clerics</strong> fits her better, so
let’s use that!</p>

<p>Once again we managed to hit all the major points of the original character. Her
mandatory disadvantage is the Vow, which about as inconvenient as Pacifism
(Cannot Harm Innocents) and is priced accordingly. Kyra spends one point in
extra starting cash in order to afford the scimitar (which has the same stats as
a thrusting broadsword). Instead of a sling she uses a bow, because that’s how
sun clerics roll in Dungeon Fantasy.</p>

<p>While all those posts about the setting of Dragon’s Dogma were a blast to write
and gave me an excellent excuse to exercise the <strong>GURPS City Stats</strong> rules, I
have to be honest and admit that they were not the first thing I thought about
when I decided to do a Dragon’s Dogma adaptation. No, the first thing I always
think about converting in these cases are always the <em>characters</em>. Judging from
other efforts I’ve seen elsewhere, and from the fact that my post
about <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/02/pathfinder-df-barbarian.html">Amiri</a> seems to be the most popular individual post in this blog, I’m
not the only one. And now I get to do exactly that!</p>

<p>The process is quite similar to what Mailanka has done in his <a href="https://mailanka.blogspot.com.br/2016/07/a-psi-wars-primer.html">Psi Wars</a>
project, but a bit more accelerated since
I’ve <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/29/dragons-dogma-big-picture.html">already settled on using Dungeon Fantasy as a base</a>. In this article,
I’ll look at the basic concepts behind the class system in Dragon’s Dogma, and
then look at how the templates from Dungeon Fantasy relate to the broad
categories defined by the original game. The focus is on the <strong>DF 1</strong> templates
and their direct derivatives when those exist. Future posts in this sub-series
will deal with the more exotic templates and with racial options specific to the
setting.</p>

<h2 id="dragons-dogma-vocations-and-dungeon-fantasys-templates">Dragon’s Dogma Vocations and Dungeon Fantasy’s Templates</h2>

<p>In the original game, the player character belongs to one of nine different
<em>vocations</em>, each with its own set of special moves. While a lot can be said to
describe each of them and their abilities, most of it is actually irrelevant for
our purposes!</p>

<p>Most of the particulars of how vocations work in Dragon’s Dogma are either too
fiddly for a literal conversion (such as the numerous individual abilities), or
make no sense when removed from its original context and medium (like the fact
that you can switch vocations by going into an inn). Even most of the specific
vocations themselves don’t merit a detailed treatment, as they simply implement
traditional fantasy archetypes in the context of those mechanics we’re not using
anyway.</p>

<p>A better approach is to roll this specific implementation back to its basic
concepts, and look at it from the point of view of a character in the
setting. Never mind how much HP a fighter has or what their list of abilities
is. How would someone witnessing this character fight describe their style?</p>

<p>At its base, Dragon’s Dogma is a class-based game. And the way GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy implements “classes” is through its templates. One thing from the
original games that I’ll keep using in this article is the color-coding of
vocations, because it’s more of a sylistic tool than a pure mechanic, and it
will help organize our discussion of how the DF templates fit into the
setting.</p>

<h2 id="red-templates">Red Templates</h2>

<p>In the original game, red vocations are based on <em>strength</em>. Their practitioners
are heavily armored and carry hefty weapons. Their abilities consist of creative
ways of bringing those weapons into contact with enemy skulls in melee
combat. Though they might achieve superhuman feats, these are the product of
mundane skill and prowess.</p>

<p>The <em>Knight</em> template from Dungeon Fantasy fits this pretty much exactly, and
requires basically no change to fit into Gransys. Most actual knights should use
this template, and so Status 1 {5} or 2 {10} become discretionary advantages for
it in campaigns where that matters. It can also be used to describe common-born
soldiers trained in the fighting styles popular in Gransys.</p>

<p><em>Barbarians</em> also fit into this category, though they would most often be
wilderness-savvy melee combatants rather than enormous foreign savages. To play
such a character, do the following: Remove the discount for ST and HP, and
reduce discretionary advantage points to 22 to compensate. Reduce Basic Move to
6 and SM to 0. <em>Disregard</em> the list of disadvantages and instead choose 40
points in disadvantages from the Scout list. A Barbarian with these
modifications and the more “nautical” outdoors skill picks could represent one
of the toughest fishermen in Cassardis.</p>

<p>A simpler, less angry alternative might be to use the Knight template with the
15-point Wilderness Training lens from <strong>DF 16</strong>, and add Outdoorsman 1-4
{10/level} to its list of discretionary advantages.</p>

<p>A lot of what the original game models as special abilities are standard options
for anyone skilled in melee combat in GURPS. All of the general and
template-specific martial power-ups from <strong>DF 3</strong> and <strong>DF 11</strong> should be
allowed, and liberal use of Extra Effort in Combat should be encouraged.</p>

<h2 id="yellow-templates">Yellow Templates</h2>

<p>Yellow vocations are based on <em>agility</em>. They wear light armor, and carry
weapons such as daggers and bows. Their abilities rely on acrobatic movement,
high-precision strikes or shots, and sometimes on dirty tricks such as flash
bombs or entangling snares. Fantastic though they may be, their feats are also
the product of mundane skill and prowess.</p>

<p><em>Scouts</em> are the best-fitting template in this category, as they play pretty
much exactly like an archery-focused Dragon’s Dogma character, and their
wilderness survival skills are a welcome addition. Such a character might be a
scout for a military unit, a bandit (reformed or not), a solitary hunter, or
even a rural lordling with the addition of some Status and basic social skills.</p>

<p>The description above applies to <em>Swashbucklers</em> as well. Fencing weapons do
exist in this world, but they’re not popular in Gransys where combatants prefer
heavy armor and weapons that can defeat it. Interesting alternatives to them
include paired long knives or shortswords, which would play like a melee focused
strider from the original game. Broadswords and longswords also suit a
non-fencing duelist and provide a bit more damage in exchange for giving up
fencing parries. And there’s always the option to play someone from a region
where fencing weapons and styles are common, like Ser Mercedes. In all cases,
add Status 1 {5} or 2 {10} to the list of discretionary advantages for the
template, like for Knights.</p>

<p>If you have access to the <em>Swords Against Evil</em> article from <strong>Pyramid #3/64</strong>,
then the <em>Aristocrat</em>, <em>Duelist</em> and <em>Rogue</em> templates are also appropriate for
the setting, with the same observations on weapons as the base Swashbuckler. For
the Aristocrat, replace Higher Purpose (Blood Will Tell) {5} with Status 1 {5}
in campaigns where this matters, and add Status 2 {10} to the list of
discretionary advantages. Swashbucklers and Aristocrats could be foreign
dignitaries, or local nobility who spent time abroad and learned a foreign
fighting style. And when trained in local weapons any of the four templates
could represent anyone who relies more on skill and precision than raw strength
when fighting.</p>

<p><em>Thieves</em> certainly exist in Gransys, and though they’re not as adept in a fight
as the other “yellow” templates their movement and, well, thief skills are still
as valuable as ever. They would be particularly likely to make use of those
dirty tricks mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>As is the case for the Red templates, all applicable power-ups from <strong>DF 3</strong> and
<strong>DF 11</strong> are allowed, and the use of Extra Effort in Combat is encouraged.</p>

<h2 id="blue-templates">Blue Templates</h2>

<p>Blue vocations are based on <em>magic</em>. They wear robes or similar clothing, and
wield staffs more as spell-casting implements than as weapons. Their special
abilities are spells!</p>

<p>Normally, adapting the magic described in the original source would involve
careful research in an attempt to match the source’s magic system with one of
the many offered by GURPS. In the case of Dragon’s Dogma, though, most of the
work has already been done for us by a helpful NPC in the game itself.</p>

<p>According to wannabe mage Steffen, to work magic one must draw ambient energy
from their surroundings and channel it into the spell they wish to cast. This is
a difficult task that places great strain on the caster, particularly on their
cardiovascular and nervous systems. Therefore, despite the popular view of mages
as frail sorts, they need as much vigor and stamina as any warrior.</p>

<p>Other facts that can be glimpsed from the original’s story and gameplay are that
casting a spell takes a few seconds at most, and that a magician has potential
access to several dozen spells, some of which are prerequisites for
others. Also, magic is commonly learned from books.</p>

<p>This just happens to be a perfect summary of GURPS’ default Spell Magic
system, as detailed on the <strong>Basic Set</strong> and expanded in <strong>GURPS Magic</strong>. So
that’s what we’ll use!</p>

<p><em>Wizards</em> fit the description in the first paragraph perfectly. In fact, they
are the only type of spellcaster in the setting! This means that they have
access to the Plant, Animal, and Healing colleges of magic. They still have to
follow the prerequisite trees for those colleges.</p>

<p>The <em>Druid</em> template can still be used to represent a wizard trained in
herbalism and wilderness survival. Replace Green Thumb 1 {5} and Power
Investiture (Druidic) 3 {30} with Magery 3 {35}. Green Thumb may still be taken
as a discretionary advantage, but switch the extra levels of Power Investiture
from that list with extra levels of Magery.</p>

<p>The <em>Cleric</em> template can still represent a priest of the Faith who also trained
in magic. Replace Power Investiture 3 {30} with Magery 3 {35}, and reduce the
points dedicated to Divine abilities or spells from 25 to 20. Switch extra
levels of Power Investiture in the discretionary advantages to extra levels of
Magery.</p>

<p>We’ll take a more detailed look at the magic system in the next post in this
series. Among other things, discuss what to do about those Druidic and
Divine abilities.</p>

<h2 id="a-note-on-hybrid-templates">A Note on Hybrid Templates</h2>

<p>Hybrid vocations are those that combine the attributes of two of the previously
listed categories. They’re one of the most distinctive aspects of the Dragon’s
Dogma class system, so I’ll dedicate an article to them right after I’m done
nailing down the last details of the magic system.</p>

<p>In this article we finish our tour of Gransys by examining its capital of Gran
Soren, which is also its only settlement worthy of the name “city”. As there is
only one very specific place to deal with this time, you’ll get more details on
its history and layout, as well as important NPCs and a <strong>GURPS City Stats</strong>
writeup. This is the last post on the setting of Gransys. Next we’ll move on to
characters!</p>

<h2 id="a-tour-of-gran-soren">A Tour of Gran Soren</h2>

<p>Gran Soren became the capital of Gransys around the time Edmun Dragonsbane
became Duke, fifty years ago. Since then the fledgling town has grown into the
beating heart of all Gransys, as the pawns in the original game are fond of
saying whenever you approach its walls.</p>

<p>The city was built at the mouth of a river near the site of an ancient castle
that predates Gransys itself. Some of its walls still stand, and the roads in
the surrounding countryside weave through them. The city’s own walls are much
newer, and as sturdy as their builders could make them. The space inside them is
further divided into quarters.</p>

<h3 id="craftsmans-quarter">Craftsman’s Quarter</h3>

<p>This is where most of the city’s many workshops and guild halls
stand. Blacksmiths, builders, and other artisans work here. There’s even a small
field worked by tenant farmers. This quarter is also where the Pawn Guild is
located. Its leader is a pawn named Barnaby, who is more articulate than most of
his alien brethren. In addition to hiring out as mercenaries, they also guard a
secret in the guild’s basement: the entrance to a mysterious underground ruin
known to them as the Everfall.</p>

<p>Most weapon and item stores likely to cater to adventurers are in the Urban
Quarter (below), but this is where PCs would come to make large orders or to
hire a large workforce to build a manor or a boat. The Pawn Guild would also be
a frequent destination for groups that include Pawn PCs or that make use of NPC
Pawns.</p>

<h3 id="urban-quarter">Urban Quarter</h3>

<p>This is the city’s largest residential and commercial area. Many of the artisans
who work in the Craftsman’s Quarter have homes in this one, and it also hosts a
large permanent market that sees movement at all hours of the day.</p>

<p>This is where all the “adventurer-friendly” establishments are: inns, taverns,
and stores with large and varied inventories. Any non-magical item that doesn’t
need to be custom-made can be found on sale here, and the stuff that does can be
ordered easily. Fine-quality equipment and even minor magic items are often
found on display, too. Basic necessities such as food or clothes are
considerably more expensive in Gran Soren than in smaller towns or villages, but
their quality and variety is often higher than can be found in those smaller
locations.</p>

<h3 id="the-venery">The Venery</h3>

<p>This is technically part of the Urban Quarter, but you’ll definitely notice when
you’ve wandered into it. It’s the bad part of town, comprised of shabbier houses
and shadier businesses. It’s also where the river meets both the sea and the
city’s sewers. A slum has grown on its margins, and the city’s poorest
inhabitants dredge the mud looking for stray valuables.</p>

<p>There are few guards here, and those are the type that can be bribed to look the
other way. This makes the Venery the perfect meeting spot for criminals and
malcontents. Rumor has it that a skilled forger does business from here, and
it’s also the best place to buy illegal tools.</p>

<h3 id="noble-quarter">Noble Quarter</h3>

<p>This is where the other end of society lives. Somewhat smaller than the other
quarters, its area is mostly occupied by large mansions, an ornate cathedral,
the mint, and the Duke’s palace. Politically, the noble quarter is where all the
real action is at. Duke Edmun’s centralizing efforts mean that to gain favor
with him is to gain power, and the nobles and merchants who make their home here
engage in constant intrigue to do just that.</p>

<p>Others take alternate routes, brokering illicit deals right under the nose of
the Duke’s most loyal agents. Either way, the deals made here affect the entire
duchy.</p>

<p>The Duke holds court from his palace, and is always surrounded by a rotating set
of nobles and merchants. Aside from Edmun himself, other fixtures of the court
are his nephew Fedel and his chamberlain Aldous. Fedel holds the title of Count
of Aernst, but that is a mere formality, as Aernst Castle was attacked and razed
decades ago. Though Fedel is wealthy, he lacks the resources (and, some say, the
will) needed to retake and rebuild the castle. He currently lives in a mansion
in the noble quarter, and makes a living from trade.</p>

<p>Aldous also holds an honorary title (Count of Windbluff), and also has no
interest in claiming its associated land. He is the Duke’s Chamberlain, and the
one who actually conducts most of the day-to-day work of running the duchy. Most
who seek audience with Edmun will find themselves dealing with him instead.</p>

<p>The Noble Quarter is also where Fournival Frescobaldi, Gransys’ wealthiest
merchant, makes his home. He owns a lot of real estate in Gransys and smaller
towns, and his organization moves a lot of goods between these settlements. He
also deals in goods imported from foreign lands, both legally and illegally.</p>
