          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/10/05/fey-gnomes-dfrpg.html">Fey Gnomes in Dungeon Fantasy</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Until relatively recently, Gnomes were kinda like the Ugly Ducklings of the
small folk when it comes to games in the dungeon fantasy genre. In my
experience, Halflings have always been the tiny sneak-thieves<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and dwarves
the stocky, bearded axe murderers. Gnomes, on the other hand, just felt like a
somewhat bland blend of dwarven and halfling traits.</p>

<p>Over time, as authors began to cast about for a stronger niche for them, I began
to see a couple of different varieties. One of the most famous is the <em>tinker
gnome</em>, whose shtick is being good at messing with “advanced” technology like
clockwork mechanisms or steam engines. The Dragonlance setting takes this to an
extreme by making them pint-sized mad scientists, and the world of Warcraft
takes a similar tack. The gnome racial template present in both GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy and the DFRPG is a less extreme version of this type, having access to a
Talent that makes them good at dealing with locks, traps and making things like
crossbows.</p>

<p>The other famous gnomish niche is the <em>fey trickster</em>. Gnomes of this type
usually prefer the same type of forest that houses faeries and nymphs, can use a
bit of innate magic, and have other stats conductive to becoming good magic
users. Recent editions of D&amp;D usually go with this type of gnome in most
settings that aren’t Dragonlance, and Pathfinder follows suit.</p>

<p>If you want to play this type of gnome in your Dungeon Fantasy game, this racial
template will help you!</p>

<h2 id="fey-gnome">Fey Gnome</h2>

<p><strong>Racial Cost</strong>: 0 points</p>

<p>Fey Gnomes are about as big as halflings, but no one would confuse the two. With
their slim builds, pointy ears, large eyes and wildly-colored hair they look
more like tiny psychedelic elves. Tough they are mortal, these gnomes still have
a strong connection to the faerie realm, which manifests in their natural talent
for magic and their predilection for whimsy and pranks.</p>

<p>In Golarion (Pathfinder’s setting), these gnomes were native to an otherworldly
faerie realm, and were kicked out of it in the distant past. They never quite
adapted to mortal life, and to this day have some trouble relating to other
peoples or settling down.</p>

<p>In other settings, most Fey Gnomes might still live in those realms, or visit
them regularly! Gnomish communities would be more common here, and would rely
heavily on illusion magic to protect themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Attribute Modifiers</strong>: ST-3 {-30}; IQ+1 {20}; HT+1 {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Characteristic Modifiers</strong>: SM -2; HP+1 {2}; Basic Move -1 {-5}.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Magery 0 {5}; Night Vision 5 {5}; Gnome Magic {3}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Impulsiveness (12) {-10}.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>: Wild, brightly colored hair and/or dark eyes without pupils.</p>

<h3 id="special-gnome-traits">Special Gnome Traits</h3>

<h4 id="gnome-magic">Gnome Magic<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></h4>

<p>You may learn up to three <em>wizardly</em> or <em>druidic</em> spells without regard for
pre-requisites! You must specify which spells those are during character
creation, though you can wait to actually learn them later if you wish. You must
still pay points to learn the spells as normal. If your Magery is 1 or more, it
gives a bonus to these spells (even if they are druidic).</p>

<p>The spells don’t all have to be from the same “power source” - you can choose
one wizardly and two druidic spells, or any other combination. Your choice is
subject to GM approval. Popular spells for gnomes include Apportation, Sound,
Light, Beast Speech, Invisibility or other illusions.</p>

            <p>In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game.  Links to all of them will appear in
the <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">project page</a>, which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions. Also, I wish the names of the two versions were a bit less similar.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Cleric, which means today’s star is Kyra. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Kyra.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Kyra’s character design is among my favorite from the Pathfinder iconics. You
can find her full bio <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Kyra">here</a>, and her original Pathfinder
stats <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/kyra.html">here</a>. From looking at them we can see the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Kyra is from Qadira, her world’s Persia/Arabia equivalent. She’s the sole
survivor from a bandit raid on her farming village.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kyra is a cleric of <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Sarenrae">Sarenrae</a>, the goddess of healing, redemption,
honesty, and the sun. She teaches her devotees to always seek to redeem those
who follow the path of evil, and to destroy them if that proves impossible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wields a scimitar, her deity’s favored weapon. Her cleric spells generally
have a “light, fire and healing” theme, and she possesses the typical D&amp;D
cleric ability to turn undead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/15/pathfinder-df-cleric.html">original</a> version used the modified Sun Cleric template from GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy 7: Clerics, but here we have no choice but to go with the basic
Cleric template from the DFRPG boxed set. That’s not a bad thing, however! It
turns out that the Cleric spell list has been tweaked to include a bit more
righteous burnination, so it ends up being quite close to that of the Sun Cleric.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h2>

<p>Kyra spent 1 point in extra starting cash to afford the scimitar (which has the
same stats as a broadsword). Her mandatory “holy” disadvantage is the Vow, which
means she must always offer enemies a chance to surrender and repent, and only
fight those who refuse. This is about as inconvenient as the Pacifism (Cannot
Harm Innocents) disadvantage from the GURPS Basic Set, and so is worth the same.</p>

<p>She also has the Diplomacy and Riding (Horse) skills, which make sense for her
and are in the rules despite not being on the template.</p>

<h3 id="changes-from-the-first-iteration">Changes from the First Iteration</h3>

<p>The Psychic Guidance perk doesn’t exist in the boxed set, so it was replaced by
1 level of Resist Evil and she had to spend points on Innate Attack for her
Sunbolt spell. And while Kyra was indeed able to keep most of her spell list she
still had to trade Ignite Fire (which is not on the list) and Continual Sunlight
(which is not in the box at all) for Resist Cold and Glow, respectively.</p>

<p>Kyra’s armor loadout also changed significantly, since mail is much more
expensive when using the rules from the boxed set. She also lost the bow and
arrows, relying on Sunbolts for ranged attacks.</p>

<p>Our second subject is Lem the Bard. Here he is:</p>

  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can find his full bio <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Lem">here</a>, and his original Pathfinder stats can
be found <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/lem.html">here</a>. From looking at them we can see the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lem was born a slave in the devil-worshipping nation of Cheliax. He escaped in
a rather fiery fashion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He hates slavery and slavers, and tends to side with the underdog in most
conflicts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lem has a sling and a shortsword, both sized for a halfling, but prefers to
use his magic in a fight. He mostly uses his bard song to bolster his allies,
and targets particularly tough foes with hindering spells to make them easier
to take down.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s what he looks like in the DFRPG rules:</p>

<h2 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h2>

<p>I find that this new iteration of Lem doesn’t match the original d20 stats quite
as closely as the first one, despite still being a very serviceable DFRPG
bard. Let’s take a look at what changed to see why.</p>

<h3 id="changes-from-the-first-iteration">Changes from the First Iteration</h3>

<p>You can see the original version <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/08/pathfinder-df-bard.html">here</a>. As I said above, this iteration is a
bit less faithful to the d20 stats than the first, and the main reason for this
is that the Alarum song is not in the DFRPG. That’s the song that bolsters your
allies in combat, matching the effect of the basic d20 Bard Song power. In its
place, he gets the Song of Terror and the Song of Echoes. This means that his
general tactics stay the same, but now he focuses on scaring away his enemies
rather than strengthening his allies.</p>

<p>There are several other changes, but they’re more beneficial. Lem now has a few
more skills, and his musical skills in particular are higher because the Musical
Ability advantage has been rolled into Bardic Talent. His Terror spell was
removed because the Terror Song already does the same thing a bit better.</p>

<p>The other big change here is in his equipment. GURPS Dungeon Fantasy had
detailed rules for under-sized gear to fit smaller races, and those are absent
from the DFRPG. This means that all of Lem’s gear is human-sized or, in the case
of his clothing, has the same cost and weight as the human sized version.</p>

<p>The good news is that his weapons do the more damage, though since he still has
ST 8 his songs and spells are still a better option. The bad news is that he’s
carrying a lot more weight and is at Light Encumbrance by default. And since
even basic enchantments cost a lot more, he loses the Fortify enchantment in his
clothes.</p>

            <p>As I explained in my <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/20/pathfinder-iconics-take-2.html">previous post</a>, now that the DFRPG has been published
and is nearly available for sale, I’m redoing my set of Pathfinder
Iconics. Since the professional templates names haven’t changed, Amiri the
Barbarian is once again our first subject. We’ll repeat the summary of her bio
with the link to the full d20 stats so you don’t need to read both articles to
understand the character. If you’re curious, you can see a link to the old
article at the end of this one, along with a discussion on what changed from one
to the other.</p>

<p>Amiri’s full official bio and character sheet can be found <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/amiri.html">here</a>. Judging
from those, we can glean a few facts about her:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Amiri is good at outdoor survival in cold climates, since she returned from a
“suicide” scouting mission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amiri is of normal human size, but fights with an oversized sword that used to
belong to a frost giant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She’s fiercely competitive and doesn’t like being outdone at barbarian
heroing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She relies a lot on the d20 Barbarian Rage power when fighting, and might get
angry enought to lose her mind. In other words, the purpose of Amiri is to
flip out and kill people.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s what she looks like in the new rules:</p>

<h2 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h2>

<p>Amiri spent 2 points on extra starting cash to buy the big sword.</p>

<h3 id="changes-from-the-first-iteration">Changes from the First Iteration</h3>

<p>You can see her GURPS Dungeon Fantasy version <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/02/pathfinder-df-barbarian.html">here</a>. Like in the previous
iteration, Amiri is still pretty faithful to her bio and original stats, but
some things had to change to fit the DFRPG ruleset.</p>

<p>The biggest one that the Great Rage powerup does not exist in the boxed set, so
she can’t have it here. The 20 points it cost instead went to buy 2 more points
of ST, which turned out to be a pretty good compromise! The new Amiri might not
be quite as strong as the old one while her Rage was on, but she’s stronger at
all other times and doesn’t need to worry about keeping track of rage-induced
Fatigue.</p>

<p>Another noticeable change is that her giant sword is slightly smaller here, as
there are no rules for oversized weapons in the boxed set. This ends up working
in her favor, as the new weapon is much cheaper and lighter while doing only one
less point of damage (the loss of which is compensated by her higher ST). In the
end, we can just say it was a giant’s shortsword instead of a giant’s broadsword
and call it a day.</p>

<p>And while we’re speaking of equipment, you might notice her armor is
significantly different now. It was built using the <strong>GURPS Low-Tech</strong>-inspired
rules from the boxed set. Torso and head DR are lower, but now her limbs are
covered. This is roughly equivalent to the hide armor listed in the d20 stats,
so I’m happy.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>A while ago I spent quite some time statting up Pathfinder Iconic characters for
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>, one for each template from <strong>DF1</strong>. That project even
has its own page <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">here</a>, where you can see all the completed
characters. Aside from being fun in itself (I like making characters!), the main
motivation was to provide a resource for players just getting into <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy</strong>, and into the as yet unreleased <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying
Game</strong>.</p>

<p>Well, the DFRPG is out to backers now, and will be out to everyone else pretty
soon. Now that I can get a good look at its text, I see that the difference
between it and the GURPS DF line is not unlike that between the first and second
edition of, say, AD&amp;D. A lot of things are the same, but there are enough
differences that you might need to do a little work to use material from one
game in the other.</p>

<p>And so it turned out that my set of converted Pathfinder Iconics doesn’t quite
fit the DFRPG rules, mostly because a lot of them include material from the
GURPS line that didn’t make it into the standalone boxed set. As I still want
them to be useful to players of the latter, it’s time to do a little conversion!</p>

<p>Here’s what’s going to happen: I’m going to redo all of the Iconics that
correspond to the templates present in the DFRPG boxed set, which is everyone
except for Seoni the Sorceress. Each of them is going to go up as a new article
that will be linked alongside the old one in the project page. The new PCs will
be built using <em>only</em> material found in the DFRPG boxed set, with perhaps a bit
of original material tossed in where needed (like for Lini’s racial
template). Each article will also comment on the differences between the
resulting stats.</p>

<p>Like GURPS DF versions, these are inspired by the official published bios and
stats for the iconics. Their capabilities are mostly inspired by the 7th-level
version of the stats, and their gear by the 1st-level version, since that’s
closer to what a character’s starting money can buy. This time around I’ll also
take inspiration from the GURPS DF stats, of course, since my decisions on how
to adapt stuff from d20 to GURPS haven’t really changed. I hope you enjoy the
new versions!</p>
