            <p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Technically, any creature with the “elemental” origin is an elemental, but as we
saw in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/16/elemental.html">Elemental</a> entry from the first monster manual the name is also
used for a particularly wild subset of that plane’s denizens.</p>

<p>As you can see in that earlier post, Elementals proper are some of the “basest”
life forms of the Elemental Chaos, with bodies that share a lot more with their
constituent elements than with any sort of living organism. Unlike demons
they’re not actively malicious, but they’re mercurial and easy to provoke into a
rampage.</p>

<p>As magical beasts, they’re technically sapient, but their intellects tend to be
rather limited. These creatures are also often bound by elementally-inclined
ritual casters such as mortal wizards, efreets, and others.</p>

<p>The MM2 presents us with more elementals ranging from the mid-Heroic to the
early Epic tier.</p>

<h2 id="chillfire-destroyer">Chillfire Destroyer</h2>

</figure>

<p>A Large humanoid made of ice wrapped around a fiery core, which means it has
zero chill. It’s a Level 14 Brute with 173 HP, lumbering about at Speed 5. It
has 10 resistance to cold and fire, and is immune to disease and poison. Its
<strong>fists</strong> do a mix of fire and cold damage, and it can also move its speed and
<strong>trample</strong> anyone it comes into contact with during this movement.</p>

<p>As this elemental gets damaged, its shell begins to crack. Once it’s bloodied,
its <strong>Leaking Firecore</strong> acts as an aura (radius 2) that deals fire damage to
anyone caught inside. Once it reaches 0 HP, a <strong>Firecore Breach</strong> causes it to
explode! This explosion is a Close Burst 3 vs. Reflex, dealing heavy fire
damage.</p>

<h2 id="dust-devil">Dust Devil</h2>

</figure>

<p>A being or air and earth, this capricious living whirlwind has a tendency to
sandblast anyone who makes it angry. It’s Small, and a Level 3 Skirmisher with
47 HP and a ground speed of 8. No, they can’t fly. It’s immune to disease and
poison, and it suffers a -2 penalty to all of its defenses if slowed or
immobilized.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is <strong>Grasping Winds</strong>, which targets Reflex, does some physical
damage and slides the target 3 squares. <strong>Gale Blast</strong> allows it to shift 5
squares by moving really fast, and try to knock anyone in the way prone (attack
vs. Fortitude).</p>

<p>Once per encounter it can do that sandblasting trick with <strong>Stinging Sands</strong>
(close burst 3 vs. Fortitude), which does heavy damage and blinds for a turn.</p>

<h2 id="flamespiker">Flamespiker</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-flamespiker.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These are a triple combination of air, earth, and fire, taking the form of a
Medium stony humanoid who can use high-pressure air to fire red-hot spikes from
its fiery core. They’re more like people than wildlife, and often end up hired
as front-line muscle by other sapient elementals.</p>

<p>Flamespikers are level 5 soldiers with 66 HP and a ground speed of 7. Their
immunities include disease, poison, and petrification, and they also have 10
fire resistance.</p>

<p>The flamespiker fights with its Reach 2 <strong>Stonespikes</strong> in melee, and can also
fire them at out to range 10 as <strong>Spikebolts</strong>. Both attacks do physical damage,
and the melee one also makes the target vulnerable to fire damage until the end
of the spiker’s next turn. So it pairs really well with fire elementals.</p>

<p>If an enemy within reach shifts, the stonespiker can react with a <strong>Thunderfire
Thrust</strong> (recharge 5+), which is a basic melee attack with an extra follow-up
against Fortitude that does 5 thunder damage and stuns (save ends). This makes
slipping past them a difficult proposition.</p>

<h2 id="geonid">Geonid</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-geonid.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This Large creature has more of a metabolism than most elementals, and needs to
hunt. A stony oyster-like creature, the geonid is extremely hard to tell apart
from a boulder when its shell is closed. When it reveals itself, we can see that
it’s yet another tentacular ambush predator that lives in the shallow Underdark.</p>

<p>They were initially created to guard the secret pathways of the world, and the
secret caches of weapons, dormant war-beasts, and treasure hidden there by the
forces of the primordials. Some of those caches are still out there, as are
their guardians.</p>

<p>Geonids are Level 6 Lurkers with 56 HP. They’re immune to disease, petrification
and poison, and cal roll around at speed 4. With its shell closed, potential
victims must pass a DC 28 Perception check to realize it’s not a harmless
boulder. At level 6, this is hard even for the party’s “radar”.</p>

<p>Once the geonid strikes, it fights with <strong>tentacle</strong> slaps that do standard
physical damage. It can also use a <strong>capturing grab</strong> that consists of two
weaker tentacle attacks. If both hit, it grabs the target (escape DC 17).</p>

<p>Once it’s grabbed someone, the geonid will close itself with <strong>Shell Slam</strong>,
which does a lot of things at once. It slides a grabbed victim to the geonid’s
space, and it tries to knock everyone in a close burst 2 prone (vs. Fortitude).</p>

<p>While the shell is closed, the geonid has a ground speed of 0 and a +5 to all of
its defenses, and it can’t target anyone other than the grabbed victim it pulled
inside its shell. The victim can also only target the geonid, but on the bright
side it won’t have to contend with the defense bonus. If the victim escapes, it
gets spit out and appears adjacent to the geonid, who can open its shell with a
minor action.</p>

<h2 id="mudlasher">Mudlasher</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-mudlasher.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another sapient elemental predator, mudlashers are made of well, mud. They slam
and drown their victims, and then sit atop the corpse as a puddle to slowly
digest it. They’re Medium Level 4 Brutes with 63 HP.</p>

<p>Their basic <strong>Slams</strong> do physical damage, and once per fight they can upgrade
that to a <strong>Drowning Slam</strong> that targets Fortitude and adds an ongoing damage
follow-up (save ends).</p>

<p>They can also fling <strong>mud balls</strong> at range (vs. Reflex), which do no damage but
slow their targets. If a target is already slowed, it’s immobilized
instead. This is good because the mudlasher gets a +2 to attacks against slowed
or immobilized targets. A save will end either condition.</p>

<h2 id="rockfist-smasher">Rockfist Smasher</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-rockfist-smasher.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The name says it all: they’re humanoid rocks that like to smash with their
fists. Smashers don’t need to eat, so they do that for fun. People who build
elemental themed dungeons like to gather a bunch of these and lock them in
chambers and at the bottom of pits as living traps.</p>

<p>These hooligans are Large, Level 10 Brutes with 125 HP, the standard suite of
earth-creature immunities, and a speed of 5. Their <strong>Granite Punches</strong> do good
damage and knock bloodied targets prone.</p>

<p>When a smasher gets bloodied itself, its <strong>Internal Avalanche</strong> triggers and
begins accumulating kinetic energy. This gives the smasher 20 temporary HP. If
it still has any temp HP at the start of its next turn, it gains an action point
that must be used in that turn.</p>

<h2 id="shardstorm-vortex">Shardstorm Vortex</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-rockfist-smasher.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These are living blizzards made of stone instead of ice. Despite this impressive
description, they’re just Medium in size and are the scavengers of the Elemental
Chaos. Shardstorms follow in the wake of more impressive beings and feed on what
remains of their battles. In battle they work like slightly stronger dust
devils.</p>

<p>They’re level 7 skirmishers with 80 HP. Their ground speed is 0, but they fly at
speed 8 with hover capability and project a <strong>Sandblast</strong> aura (radius 1) that
inflicts a -2 to all defenses of anyone caught inside.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Abrasive Slam</strong> that targets Fortitude and does
physical damage. They can also perform <strong>Whirling Blasts</strong> (recharge 5+) that
allow them to shift 4 squares and an attack at the end. This does heavy damage
and pushes 1 square on a hit. It does half damage on a miss.</p>

<p>We also get two variant stat blocks for them as minions at levels 13
and 23. They still have the aura and the basic attack, but instead of the Blast
they get a <strong>Vortex Step</strong>, an at-will 4-square shift with no built-in attack.</p>

<h2 id="stormstone-fury">Stormstone Fury</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-stormstone-fury.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a Medium stone humanoid infused with the power of a storm. It can throw
explosive stones, cause shrapnel to fly outward from its body, and meld into the
ground for a quick escape. When fighting as part of a team they don’t really
care about catching allies in their blasts, so if you find yourself on the same
side as one of these, bring some thunder protection.</p>

<p>Furies are Level 14 Artillery with 113 HP and Speed 6. They have the usual
immunity suite, and 10 thunder resistance. Its <strong>Grinding Stones</strong> melee basic
attack is terrible, but its <strong>Hurtling Thunderstones</strong> have Range 20 and do half
damage on a miss. Hit or miss, they also cause a follow-up explosion (burst 2
vs. Fortitude) that does thunder damage.</p>

<p><strong>Shrapnel Burst</strong> is their “keep away from me” power, sending shrapnel that
pushes 2 squares and does physical and thunder damage in a close burst 2
(vs. AC). If that fails, <strong>Meld to Ground</strong> removes them from the map for a
turn, after which they reappear up to 10 squares away.</p>

<h2 id="tempest-wisp">Tempest Wisp</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-tempest-wisp.png"/>
  <figcaption>
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This gaseous creature is a bit smarter than your average elemental, and actively
seeks to either ally with or coerce other creatures to form groups that
cooperate against threats. It uses its wind powers to push enemies around the
battlefield, and hides behind its allies to avoid damage.</p>

<p>Tempest Wisps are Level 13 Controllers with 134 HP. They’re immune to disease
and poison, and are insubstantial while not bloodied (i.e, while at over 50%
HP). They have a flight speed of 7 with hover capability.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is an <strong>Air Slash</strong> (vs. Reflex) that does physical damage,
and they can attack at range with <strong>Whistling Wind</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Reflex) for
about the same damage and a 1-square slide.</p>

<p>Their limited special attack is hilarious! Named <strong>Tumbling Updraft</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Fortitude; recharge 5+), it does no immediate damage but instead lifts the
target 20 feet up on a hit and restrains them (save ends). Each failed save
causes the victim to be tossed up another 20 feet. On a successful save, the
victim falls! That’s a minimum of 2d10 fall damage, plus another 2d10 for every
failed save. It’s all subject to the standard rules for falls, though, so you
might be able to reduce or avoid this damage in the usual ways.</p>

<h2 id="windfiend-fury">Windfiend Fury</h2>

<figure class="left">

<p>Yet another Angry Tornado, this one more purely “stormy” than the others. These
Large beings like to hang around elemental storms, and so tend to get swept away
into other planes. Sometimes archons will capture them and bind them to their
flying ships as a power source and as a means to travel to other planes. You can
also say these are the beings trapped at the core of those Eberron flying ships.</p>

<p>These are Level 12 Controllers with 123 HP and a flight speed of 8. Aside from
the usual immunities to disease and poison they have 15 resistance to lightning
and thunder.</p>

<p>They attack in melee with <strong>Flying Debris</strong>, and toss <strong>Lightning Strikes</strong> at
range that do lightning damage and daze for a turn. Their “keep away!” power is
a <strong>Storm Burst</strong> that does thunder damage and teleports them to just outside
the area of effect.</p>

<h2 id="windstriker">Windstriker</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-elemental-windstriker.png"/>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Our final Angry Tornado is Medium, and a Level 9 Lurker with 56 HP. They have
the usual immunities and full-time insubstantiality, along with a flight speed
of 8. It attacks unpredictably, though apparently not to feed.</p>

<p>All of their attacks do “cold and thunder” damage. They’re probably going to
open up with <strong>Searching Wind</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will), which knocks prone on a
hit and marks the target as the windstriker’s quarry as an effect. Then they’ll
follow that up with <strong>Lethal Windstrike</strong> (melee 2 vs. AC), which hits hard but
only works against the quarry. Their basic <strong>Windstrike</strong> is a lot weaker, so
it’s for emergencies only.</p>

<p>If the windstriker takes damage, it activates <strong>Shifting Wind</strong> as a reaction,
which gives it the ability to ignore opportunity attacks and pass through enemy
spaces during its next turn. So it’s going to be flitting back and forth to
alternate marking someone as a quarry and attempting to assassinate them.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s a whole bunch of sample encounters here, but they’re all easily to
described: assorted elementals of similar level, occasionally with someone who
might be the spellcaster binding them, like a tiefling heretic or a beholder.</p>

<p>I like the lore of elementals in 4e on principle, and we have lots of
mechanically varied stat blocks here… but there’s <em>so many</em> of them that they
all kinda started blurring together by the end. I almost wish we had gotten an
elemental “plug-in” module for the 4e monster design system rather than this
long list full of angry rock giants and angry living tornadoes.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>We already discussed the lore of the Eladrin <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/13/eladrin.html">over here</a>, along with how they
differ from your standard elves and from the celestials of 3e. I recommend
reading that post again for those basics.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual 2 contains three more eladrin stat blocks, along with a bit
of additional lore on their society. I find it very funny that two of them
correspond to very popular elfy classes of editions past, debuting in 4e in the
form of monster entries. It would be some time before playable versions of them
were published, which I imagine must have made their fans quite anxious.</p>

<h2 id="eladrin-arcane-archer">Eladrin Arcane Archer</h2>

<p>Arcane Archers are more than just wizards who can shoot a bow. They practice an
art that’s seamless fusion of the two disciplines, and whose secrets are
jealously kept by certain eladrin societies. The Bow Mage minions we saw in the
MM1 are likely to practice the same style. This entry would represent a more
advanced, experienced, or narratively important practitioner.</p>

<p>I don’t think we ever explicitly got an Arcane Archer class in 4e. The Seeker
tries to implement the concept using primal magic but ends up not being very
effective. I think there’s also a way to build a Bard specializing in magic
ranged attacks with a bow.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Arcane Archers are Level 5 Artillery with 51 HP. Their speed is 6 and they have
low-light vision, along with the standard Fey Step power all eladrin get.</p>

<p>In a fight, they stay at range and repeatedly fire <strong>Scorching Arrows</strong> from
their bows. This ability is kinda like a better version of the PC Ranger’s Twin
Strike, allowing them to make two attacks that target the lower of AC and
Reflex. The arrows have the same range as mundane ones, and individually deal a
low-ish mix of physical and fire damage. This adds up, though: an arcane archer
that consistently hits with both attacks punches a fair bit above its weight
class.</p>

<p>They can also fire an arrow that explodes into an <strong>Eldricht Burst</strong> (area burst
1 within 20 vs Fortitude; recharge 4+). This deals force damage and knocks
enemies prone on a hit.</p>

<h2 id="eladrin-bladesingers">Eladrin Bladesingers</h2>

<p>Ah, bladesingers. I first heard of them in 2e and I can’t remember a more
controversial class from that edition, at least here in the Brazilian fan
community. People either really loved them or really hated them. While I was
eventually convinced that their highly cinematic combat style was cool, I never
liked that they were an elf-only option.</p>

<p>Anyway, 4e bladesingers are eladrin practitioners of an ancient martial art that
joins swordplay and magic. The resulting style resembles something a Jedi knight
or wuxia hero might use, employing lots of empowered sword strikes and
magic-assisted acrobatic maneuvers. Their code of conduct has elegance as an
important principle, so they put real effort into making their combat techniques
both graceful and effective.</p>

<p>The same code also compels them to behave honorably, so they tend to treat
opponents with respect and despise those who slaughter the weak and
defenseless. Despite this, there are many possible reasons for even a party of
good-aligned PCs to come into conflict with bladesingers: they might have
offended the eladrin’s liege, or a given group of bladesingers might have fallen
to the Dark Side of the Force.</p>

<p>You can get pretty close to a playable bladesinger by playing a Swordmage, and
apparently there was also a “bladesinger” class published late in the
edition. More obliquely, a Blade Pact Fey Warlock could also fit the concept.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>The MM2 bladesinger is a Level 11 Skirmisher with 114 HP. They have a very nice
ground speed of 8, in addition to the low-light vision and Fey Step power all
eladrin get.</p>

<p>They wear mail and wield a longsword, both of which are probably magical or at
least very high quality. Their basic attack is a <strong>Brilliant Blade</strong> strike,
which deals radiant damage and gives the target a -3 penalty to attack the
bladesinger during the target’s next turn.</p>

<p><strong>Dance of Brilliance</strong> is an at-will combination that allows them to make an
attack dealing light radiant damage, shift 3 squares, and make a basic Brilliant
Blade attack against another target.</p>

<p>They have two encounter powers. <strong>Crippling Strike</strong> targets Fortitude and deals
no damage, but is guaranteed to slow the target even on a miss. On a hit it also
weakens them. In both cases the conditions are “save ends”.</p>

<p><strong>Wyvern Strike</strong> is much better, allowing the bladesinger to fly 8 squares
without provoking opportunity attacks and perform a strike at any poing along
the movement. This targets Fortitude, deals light physical damage, and 10
ongoing poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Finally there’s <strong>Combat Shift</strong>. This allows them to shift 1 square as a minor
action, ending up adjacent to an enemy against which they have combat advantage.</p>

<h2 id="coure-of-mischief-and-strife">Coure of Mischief and Strife</h2>

<p>Time for more surreal fey nobility! Like “bralani” and “ghaele”, “coure” is a
noble title whose meaning can be a little confusing to mortals. One of the
reasons for this is that while most eladrin societies use the same names for the
titles, the actual rank they confer, and the amount of influence attached to
them, varies from culture to culture. So in this city state ghaeles might be the
rulers, but on that kingdom over there they’re just minor provincial nobles and
it’s the coures who call the shots. Attaining a noble title is rarely a matter
of inheritance - there’s a lot of mystery and mystycism involved.</p>

<p>Whatever their rank, though, these titles always have some natural phenomenon or
abstract concept attached to them, like “autumn winds”, “winter”, or “mischef
and strife” in this entry. The noble in question will always have powers
relating to this area of influence.</p>

<p>So yeah, a coure of mischief and strife is a pointy-eared Loki.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-2">The Numbers</h3>

<p>This coure is a Level 17 Lurker with 129 HP. It has the usual low-light vision
and Fey Step ability, which in this case is completely redundant because the
coure also has a teleport speed of 6 to complement its ground speed of 6. It
wears leathers and fights with a <strong>rapier</strong>.</p>

<p>The coure can become <strong>invisible</strong> at will as a standard action, and this lasts
until it takes damage or <em>misses</em> with an attack. If it attacks and hits, it
stays invisible! If for some reason the eladrin doesn’t already starts the fight
invisible, this is going to be its very first action.</p>

<p>Once the invisible trickster is close to the party, <strong>Winds of Luck’s Mischief</strong>
is a good fight opener: a Close Burst 3 vs. Will that does no damage, but makes
everyone it affects miss all attacks whose attack rolls were odd. This is a
“save ends” condition, so it might stick around for a while! Good luck trying to
damage an invisible enemy when half of your blows veer off course.</p>

<p>While invisible the coure can also use <strong>Spark of Strife</strong>, a Ranged 10 attack
vs. Will that deals psychic damage and is stronger than the rapier. A hit also
forces the target to charge its nearest ally, or make a melee basic attack if
it’s already close. This compelled attack is a free action, so it doesn’t eat
into the PC’s turn. However, if the compelled attack hits, the coure gets to use
Spark of Strife against the ally that was hit by it as a free action as well! A
series of lucky rolls is going to rapidly turn the party’s well-tuned battle
formation into a Three Stooges skit.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter here is level 10: 3 bladesingers, an eladrin twilight
incanter from the first MM, and a will-o’-wisp which I guess might be the
incanter’s familiar.</p>

<p>I love how the different eladrin celestial types from 3e became a bizarre system
of nobility ranks with a lot of that good faerie flavor. As one rises in rank,
one becomes less tied to the mortal world.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Chronologically, the first appearance of Duergar in 4e is in the Monster Manual
2, but they were also in the Monster Vault so we covered their basic lore
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/10/duergar.html">here</a>. In this post, we’ll covered the duergar that appeared in the MM2 but
weren’t updated in the MV.</p>

<h2 id="previously-on-octopus-carnival">Previously on Octopus Carnival…</h2>

<p>For your information, these are the duergar entries we covered <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/10/duergar.html">previously</a>:
Scout, Guard, Thug, Raid Leader, Infernal Consort, and Devil-Bred Duergar.</p>

<p>This still leaves us with a sizable selection of stat blocks that didn’t make it
into the Monster Vault. They include some elite warrior types, and several
Hell-themed spellcasters that resemble either warlocks or clerics.</p>

<p>As we saw in that earlier post, all duergar share two signature traits:
resistance to fire and poison that increases with their level, and the ability
to shoot out their Infernal Quills at someone, once per fight as a minor
action. This has a Range of 3, does light physical damage and a tiny bit of
ongoing poison damage. It also inflicts a -2 penalty to attack rolls. A single
save ends both the ongoing damage and the attack penalty.</p>

<h2 id="duergar-theurge">Duergar Theurge</h2>

<p>The weakest of the spellcasters we’re going to look at here. Theurges wear robes
and wield warhammers in melee. At range they fight with a number of spells
themed around fire, smoke, and despair.</p>

<p>Despite the name they feel a bit more wizardly than the others, who are more
clearly priests of some kind.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Theurges are Level 5 Controllers with 63 HP. They wear robes and fight with
<strong>warhammers</strong> in melee. Their basic ranged attacks are <strong>Hellbolts</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Reflex) that do fire damage.</p>

<p>They also have a few more powerful spells. <strong>Brimstone Hail</strong> (recharge 5-6)
does fire damage over a fireball-sized area and knocks targets prone on a
hit. <strong>Vile Fumes</strong> (recharges when first bloodied) does poison damage over the
same area and blinds for a turn on a hit. And <strong>Wave of Despair</strong> is a daily
blast 5 vs. Will and does psychic damage, slows, and dazes (save ends both).</p>

<h2 id="duergar-shock-trooper">Duergar Shock Trooper</h2>

<p>Shock troopers are somewhat similar to the guards we saw in <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/10/duergar.html">the first
article</a>, but stronger and more suited to open warfare. They wield mauls
instead of puny warhammers and have the ability to grow bigger when the fight
grows more intense!</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Troopers are Level 6 Brutes with 84 HP. Their <strong>mauls</strong> have no special effects
aside from hitting hard, and their <strong>Infernal Quills</strong> attack works as usual.</p>

<p>When first bloodied, they can <strong>Expand</strong> as a free action, growing to size
Large. This makes them take up 4 squares and pushes anyone who was adjacent to
make room for their new bulk. It also gives them a +2 attack bonus and a +5
damage bonus.</p>

<h2 id="duergar-fleshtearer">Duergar Fleshtearer</h2>

<p>With a name “Fleshtearer”, you’d expect this duergar to be a mindless berserker,
but it’s actually a sneaky magical assassin that fights with claws made of smoke
and can become invisible to better slice you with them and make your wounds
bleed faster.</p>

<h3 id="the-number">The Number</h3>

<p>Fleshtearers are Level 11 Lurkers with 89 HP. Their <strong>claws</strong> also do ongoing
damage. If they have combat advantage they can instead attack with a <strong>Quill
Stab</strong> that has the same effect as the signature Infernal Quills power as a
melee attack. This one recharges whenever the duergar hits with the basic claw.</p>

<p><strong>Underdark Sneak</strong> (minor action) requires them to be in dim light or darkness,
or adjacent to some cover. It makes them invisible for a turn or until right
after they attack. <strong>Shadow Scourge</strong> is a passive trait that builds on this by
doubling the ongoing damage the duergar causes if it attacks from invisibility.</p>

<h2 id="duergar-hellcaller">Duergar Hellcaller</h2>

<p>This caster-type has focused their infernal magic on having the most fabulous
set of quills in the Underdark. They can fire quills all day long, unlike their
less well-endowed compatriots. Rounding out their arsenal is a small set of
diabolic curses and summoning spells.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-2">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Hellcallers are Level 12 Artillery with 96 HP. They wield <strong>maces</strong> for
emergency, but as usual for artillery monsters the real interesting bits are the
ranged attacks.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Infernal Quills</strong> are an at-will Ranged 10 attack, and have the same
effects as the encounter version for other duergar. They can momentarily
increase their rate of fire to make this attack as a minor action, and to fire
off a <strong>Quill Storm</strong> (area 2 within 10 vs. Reflex) that covers an area and
deals more ongoing damage than usual. Both of these special uses are encounter
powers.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can also conjure <strong>Asmodeus’s Ruby Curse</strong> (close blast
5 vs. Will; enemies only) that deals psychic damage and slides those hits to the
outside of the affected area. This movement <em>does</em> provoke opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>If someone manages to get close enough to make a melee attack against the
hellcaller, it can use <strong>Devilish Sacrifice</strong> as an interrupt. This causes the
duergar to shift beyond the attack’s reach, and to summon a legion devil
hellguard into its former position. The attack targets the new minion, and if it
misses the devil gets to act right after the hellcaller in the initiative order
from now on.</p>

<h2 id="duergar-blackguard">Duergar Blackguard</h2>

<p>This evil paladin-type uses its martial skills and magic powers to isolate and
pursue individual PCs across the battlefield. It wears plate and wields both a
shield and a warhammer.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-3">The Numbers</h3>

<p>This is a Level 13 Elite Soldier with 260 HP. Its basic attack is a <strong>Blighted
Warhammer</strong> that deals damage as usual and triggers a secondary attack against
Fortitude with similar effects to the standard Infernal Quills power.</p>

<p>The blackguard’s own quills are a bit stronger than usual, replacing the
standard power with a <strong>Quill Burst</strong> that does the same damage in a Close Burst
3 around the duergar.</p>

<p>The “isolate and pursue” part comes from a pair of abilities: <strong>Darkfire Mark</strong>
(minor action 1/round) marks an enemy and compels it to approach and attack the
blackguard - if the enemy fails to do both in its next turn, it takes 10 fire
and necrotic damage. <strong>Infernal Footwork</strong> is a reaction that allows the
blackguard to shift 2 squares in pursuit of an adjacent enemy who tries to get
away from it. If that enemy is marked, the blackguard also gets to make a hammer
attack against it.</p>

<h2 id="duergar-blasphemer">Duergar Blasphemer</h2>

<p>The strongest priest-type we’ll see here, weaker only than the Infernal Consort
from the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/10/duergar.html">Monster Vault article</a>. Like the Hellcaller, the Blasphemer also
has Big Quill Energy, though its other magic is more focused on disruptive mind
control effects.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-4">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Blasphemers are Level 14 Controllers (Leaders) with 140 HP who wield
<strong>greatclubs</strong> in battle. Like Hellcallers, they can fire <strong>Infernal Quills</strong> at
will and use a Quick Quill Strike once per encounter.</p>

<p>Aside from the quills, they have three spells:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Preach Submission</strong> (Close burst 10 vs. Will; minor action 1/round) does no
damage but marks on a hit (save ends). An already-marked target is instead
knocked prone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eyes of Asmodeus</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) also does no damage, but
weakens and marks for a turn on a hit. On a miss, or as an after-effect on a
hit, the target is slowed (save ends). This combos nicely with Preach
Submission to knock someone prone immediately.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sinner’s Slip</strong> is an interrupt that redirects an attack made against the
blasphemer to the attacker’s closest ally. If no allies can be targeted in
this way the attacker is instead knocked prone and takes some psychic damage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s one sample encounter here. It’s Level 4, consisting of 2 guards, 1
scout, 1 theurge, and 4 orc drudges that are probably their slaves.</p>

<p>That sure is a lot of duergar, and it further increases the variety and level
range of the available opposition if you want your PCs to go up against a whole
fortress full of them.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Drakkoths, also known as Dracotaurs, have been around since at least 3e. They
also look like something I’d find in some of the more exotic BECMI supplements.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Like a number of other peoples, drakkoths are distant relatives of
dragons. Their humanoid half looks like a crested dragonborn, and their
quadruped half like a small wingless dragon.</p>

<p>Drakkoths are nomadic, somewhat insular and territorial, and have enough
technology to make steel weapons. Their preferred terrain are forests and
jungles, and the borders of their claimed territory tend to shift slightly over
time.</p>

<p>According to the book some drakkoth communities worship Tiamat, but others
choose to venerate an individual dragon patron instead. This is most often an
elder or ancient green, given their common terrain preference. I imagine you
could have communities of Bahamut-worshipping or good-dragon-venerating
drakkoths as well. Some dragons actively seek to set themselves as the bosses of
a drakkoth community, because as far as potential servants go they’re a lot more
useful than kobolds.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Drakkoths are very strong and tough, and quite smart as well. They mostly fight
with weapons, to which they apply poison. They tend to wear hide and leather
armor, but you could also say their scaly hides are naturally tough if you’re so
inclined. Their superior movement speed means they favor “cavalry” and
skirmishing tactics.</p>

<p>They can also breathe poison in a manner similar to a green dragon, and are
prone to flying into a rage that leaves them immune to pain when bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="common-traits">Common Traits</h3>

<p>Drakkoths are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Reptile keyword. They have
low-light vision, and their four legs give them a respectable speed of 7. Though
all of them have a breath weapon and a rage ability, the exact effects vary with
each stat block.</p>

<h3 id="drakkoth-ambusher">Drakkoth Ambusher</h3>

<p>This is a Level 13 Skirmisher with 131 HP. It fights with a Reach 2 <strong>glaive</strong>
that does a mix of physical and poison damage. It can also employ a <strong>Sudden
Rush</strong> maneuver (move action; recharge 5-6), allowing it to shift its speed and
make attacks vs. the Reflex of every enemy it moves adjacent to. This does no
damage, but knocks prone on a hit. They also do extra “sneak attack” damage
against an enemy granting <strong>combat advantage</strong> to them.</p>

<p>Their breath weapon is a very dragon-like <strong>Venomous Hiss</strong> (close blast 2
vs. Reflex; recharges when first bloodied). It does poison damage, and ongoing
poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>While bloodied the ambusher enters a <strong>Drakkoth Rage</strong>, which makes it tougher
by granting it 10 temporary HP whenever it hits with an attack.</p>

<h3 id="drakkoth-rager">Drakkoth Rager</h3>

<p>A Level 15 Elite Brute with 366 HP, the rager is a lot more direct in its
approach to combat. It wields a <strong>battleaxe</strong> and can perform a <strong>Raging
Cleave</strong> that does the same damage as the basic attack plus a bit of extra
poison damage in a Close Burst 1. It <em>wants</em> to be surrounded.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Venomous Hiss</strong> and its <strong>Drakkoth Rage</strong> have all the same effects as
those of the ambusher, but the rage also gives it a +2 to attacks and +5 to
damage.</p>

<h3 id="drakkoth-venomshot">Drakkoth Venomshot</h3>

<p>This archer is Level 16 Artillery with 125 HP, and carries a <strong>longsword</strong> and a
<strong>longbow</strong> into combat. Its arrows have a rider that gives the target
Vulnerable 10 Poison (save ends), which pairs nicely with the poisoned weapons
of its buddies.</p>

<p>Instead of the standard Venomous Hiss, it can use a <strong>Venomshot Hiss</strong> that does
less damage but can be used more often, recharging at the end of any turn where
the venomshot is bloodied. Its <strong>Rage</strong> is the same as the ambusher’s.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>In addition to palling around with dragons, drakkoths also train creatures
native to their territories to fight alongside them, and they can make
short-term alliances with neighbors to take down powerful threats.</p>

<p>We get two sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: a rager, two venomshots, and a viscera devourer. I bet there’s an
interesting story behind that one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 16: 3 ambushers, 2 venomshots, and a roc!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I didn’t even remember drakkoths existed before I got to this entry, but these
look interesting. I’m sure you could also reskin bog-standard centarus into
drakkoths and vice-versa.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Drakes make their debut on the first 4e Monster Manual, and this entry brings us
a few more of them. They remain a popular choice of animal for domestication but
the intro text mentions they retain a wild side.</p>

<h2 id="bloodseeker-drake">Bloodseeker Drake</h2>

<p>These expert trackers were included in the Monster Vault, so we already looked
at them <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/01/drakes.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="horned-drake">Horned Drake</h2>

<p>In the wild, horned drakes are pack predators who spend most of the day sleeping
and basking in the sun, going out to hunt at night. They have an excellent
instinct for teamwork, and a pack of them is able to take down much larger prey.</p>

<p>I imagine that, when domesticated, they make stronger alternatives to the
bog-standard guard drake, treating their handlers as part of the pack.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Horned Drakes are Medium Natural Beasts and Level 5 Skirmishers with 63 HP. They
have low-light vision and a speed of 6.</p>

<p>This drake’s basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> that does standard physical damage and
allows the creature to shift 2 squares on a hit. The <strong>Pack Movement</strong> reaction
also allows them to shift 2 squares when an enemy adjacent to them is hit by a
melee attack. This makes them great a setting up flanks with their fellow drakes
or with their handlers.</p>

<p>The drake can also make a <strong>Goring Horns</strong> attack, which does high physical
damage and knocks prone on a hit. It also has a +1 attack bonus over the basic
attack, which indicates to me that it’s meant to be a charge.</p>

<p>So, these drakes are set up charge an enemy, then surround and run circles
around it.</p>

<h2 id="scytheclaw-drake">Scytheclaw Drake</h2>

<p>Another species of pack predator, scytheclaws inhabit forests and
grasslands. They are known for their cunning and for their devious tactics. If
you see one scytheclaw, odds are there are two or three others approaching you
from behind.</p>

<p>In other words, they’re Jurassic Park raptors!</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Scytheclaws are Medium Natural Beasts and Level 10 Skirmishers with 105 HP,
which explains why the Jurassic Park protagonists had such trouble with
them. Their ground speed is an amazing 10.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is the titular <strong>Scytheclaw</strong>, which deals physical damage
and knocks the target prone. If used against an already prone target, it hits
harder and inflicts 5 ongoing damage (save ends).</p>

<p>When the drake hits with its basic attack, it can immediately use <strong>Springing
Step</strong> (free action; recharge 4-6), which allows it to jump 8 squares and attack
someone else at the end of the jump. This doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks
from the target of the original attack, making it safe to move away from most
PCs.</p>

<p>If a prone enemy within reach tries to get up, its <strong>Overwhelming Attacker</strong>
trait allows it to make an opportunity attack against that enemy. If this hits,
the target remains prone.</p>

<p>Scytheclaws are therefore set up to bounce between PCs while knocking them
prone, and they will absolutely kick you when you’re down.</p>

<h2 id="fang-titan-drake">Fang Titan Drake</h2>

<p>If you include the Raptors, you almost certainly have to include the T-Rex as
well. And sure enough, here it is. The largest species of drake, few creatures
other than dragons can pose much of a treat to them. Mostly solitary, they claim
large territories and chase away all other big predators, so ironically
creatures beneath the fang titan’s notice end up enjoying a measure of
protection.</p>

<p>In most settings, such a creature would be impossible to domesticate, but in
D&amp;D’s implied setting some sapients such as giants can manage it due to not
being that much smaller than them.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-2">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Fang Titans are Huge Natural Animals and Level 18 Elite Controllers with 348
HP. Their ground speed is 8.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a humongous <strong>bite</strong> that can target one or two creatures,
dealing physical damage and dazing them (save ends). They can also grab one of
the targets on a hit.</p>

<p>They can also attack with a <strong>Tail Sweep</strong> (close burst 2 vs. Reflex; recharge
4-6) that does high physical damage and knocks prone. Their <strong>Furious Roar</strong>
works exactly like a dragon’s Frightful Presence, and when they’re bloodied they
recharge it and use it immediately as a free action.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters And Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Two sample drake encounters in this entry:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 3: A lizardfolk hunting party with a pair of bloodseeker drakes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 19: A quartet of fire giants and their pet fang titan.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As I mentioned during my reading of the MM/MV, I love drakes and more of them
are always welcome. For many of them, it’s also easy to “de-skin” them as
dinosaurs if you’re so inclined, but making them a distinct type of creature
also frees the authors (and you!) from having to adhere to best paleontological
practices.</p>
