            <p>Say you’re a GURPS player who’s inspired to make a dashing pirate, a badass
veteran soldier with a cool eyepatch, or maybe even a cyclops knight. Then you
look up the One Eye disadvantage and notice that it gives you major penalties in
combat.</p>

<p>While this is realistic, the type of story that likely inspired you is quite
cinematic, which makes seeing those penalties a bit disappointing. One-eyed
movie and game protagonists never seem to be inconvenienced by their
disability. In fact, it’s often turned into an asset, as it makes enemies
underestimate them. Here’s a new disadvantage to emulate that.</p>

<h3 id="one-eye-cinematic--5-points">One Eye, Cinematic (-5 points)</h3>

<p>You may have only one eye, but that doesn’t even slow you down! You do not
suffer from the DX and skill penalties from the realistic version of this
advantage, and may generally behave as if you had perfect depth perception and a
full field of view. This is typical of action heroes, and naturally one-eyed
aliens or fantasy creatures.</p>

<p>This is worth points as a disadvantage because you still do have only one eye!
If that eye is crippled, you’re <em>blind</em>. You also suffer any other consequences
that might be attached ot the condition in your setting, such as social
penalties or bonuses for other people to recognize you.</p>

<p>This disadvantage is also still worth points in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong>. Its implied
setting might not attach any social penalties to the condition, but it <em>does</em>
make losing an eye something far more likely to happen than in other settings,
which puts you at an increased risk of going blind.</p>

<p>I’ll begin this review by saying I’m really not the best person to review the
<strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> (DFRPG). It’s not that dislike it: in fact,
I loved it! However, I’m really bad at reading through the text in detail and
spotting all the differences between the game and the GURPS supplements that
originated it. I know these differences exist, and I know they make the game
better, but I’ll probably only internalize them when I reference the text in
play enough times.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it seems I’m late to the party when it comes to reviewing the
<strong>DFRPG</strong>, so I can point you to lots of other reviews by other people who are
better at this than me! Just Roll 3d6 has very detailed reviews of
the <a href="http://justroll3d6.com/dfrpg-review-adventurers/">Adventurers</a> and <a href="http://justroll3d6.com/dfrpg-review-exploits/">Exploits</a> books. <a href="https://pseudoboo.blogspot.com.br/">Let’s GURPS</a> is reviewing all
the recently-released books too. And I’m sure many other reviews will pop up in
time.</p>

<p>What I’ll do in this article is something only I can do: give you my own opinion
on the game. Whether that is of any value is left as an exercise for the
reader.</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

<p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> is my favorite edition of D&amp;D. Go out
and buy it as soon as it comes out.</p>

<h2 id="wait-what">Wait, What?</h2>

<p>Technically, my favorite edition of D&amp;D is 4th, but it occupies that position
for very specific reasons. It allows me to run cool, flashy battles in the style
of turn-based tactical RPGs such as Disgaea, Fire Emblem, or Final Fantasy
Tactics. If I want a campaign that feels like that, I reach for D&amp;D 4.</p>

<p>If I don’t want to run a campaign that feels like that, my tastes get a bit
fiddlier. I will <em>play</em> D&amp;D 5th edition if no other alternative presents itself,
but it doesn’t look very exciting to GM. Earlier editions add to that an
elaborate list of varied complaints that I’m sure anyone familiar with them can
guess, and I’m not one of those enlightened souls who can forget about them for
long enough to enjoy a session.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> has a premise that’s exactly like that
of Basic D&amp;D (one of the most popular OSR darlings), married to a ruleset that
does everything most editions of D&amp;D do in a way I find better. It’s
point-based! It has a unified mechanic! It has a good skill system!
Warrior-types are <em>actually</em> better at combat than spellcasters!</p>

<p>You can of course also run flashy set-piece battles with it, and they’ll tend to
have a feel that’s closer to that of the old-school editions.</p>

<p>It takes all of that from GURPS. Its rules are a specialized version of GURPS
4th Edition, with everything that’s not relevant to dungeon-crawling fantasy
campaigns stripped out and the rest adapted to the purpose. Some parts are
simpler than in the original rules, some are not, but they’re all useful. A lot
of those things which usually lead to heated arguments between players and DMs
are given proper rules and effects here. Want to stab that ogre in the eye?
Perform some unlikely feat of parkour? Check to see if that dead monster has
valuable body parts? The system has you covered.</p>

<p><strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> gives you 11 “professional templates” that are roughly
equivalent to some of the most popular D&amp;D classes, and which can be humans or
one of a selection of 8 racial templates that includes all the usual suspects
plus the Catfolk<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>While the game focuses very heavily on dungeon-delving, it’s certainly possible
to use it for fantasy campaigns that go beyond the dungeon. It has more support
for social interaction than Basic D&amp;D does<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and bringing in more detailed
rules from GURPS is extremely easy, if the GM thinks it’s necessary.</p>

<p>So yes, if I was planning on running a D&amp;D-ish campaign and wasn’t after the
very specific feel of D&amp;D 4 combat, I would use <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> in
preference to any other actual edition of D&amp;D. In fact, I have been doing
just that for years using the previous iteration of these rules, and will gladly
switch to the new one now that I have it in my hands.</p>

<p><strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> isn’t yet available to the public as of this writing, but
the Kickstarter backers have already begun receiving their copies. Both the
printed and PDF versions should appear on <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com">Warehouse 23</a> in October.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/08/08/planet-mercenary-actual-play.html">Skynet&#39;s Avengers: The Damaxuri Deception, Part 1</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Having <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/08/07/planet-mercenary-actual-play.html">finished our characters</a>, we gathered ‘round in the second “gap”
weekend to play through <em>The Damaxuri Deception</em>. We started one hour later than
usual, due to some uncertainty over whether I would be able to make it and due
to one other player having spent the previous night at a party. Everyone else,
including me, was able to make it at the usual time of 9 AM, so we spent that
hour finishing up our fireteams.</p>

<p>Now, the players were well-aware of their company’s financial dire straits, and
from the skills they had chosen it was clear that they expected to get into
fights early and often. So I told then this adventure started in a dangerous and
unfamiliar place fraught with tension and itchy trigger fingers… a mercenary
convention! The quotes below are freely translated from Portuguese, since that
was the language we played in.</p>

<h2 id="scene-1-merccon-713">Scene 1: MercCon 713</h2>

<p>Welcome to the 713th edition of Merc-Con! Taking place in a quaint historical
habitat above scenic Damaxuri, and partly sponsored by the city of
Mellsen-Anlied (located on the surface under the station). And if you believe
the habitat is quaint or the planet is scenic, I’ve got a bridge to sell
you. This flating hunk of junk they call a station was the only place that would
consent to hosting an event for 2000 mercenaries.</p>

<p>Into it go the officers of Skynet’s Avengers, accompanied by a small drone
projecting the unblinking red eye that is the avatar of Skynet herself<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Why
are they going to a conference when the company is in the red? Skynet paid for
it ages ago and the fee is non-refundable, so they might as well make the most
of it. And hey, someone there might be hiring!</p>

<p>The station is quite hot and stinky because its creaky life support systems
can’t keep up with the body heat and body odor of 2000 sweaty mercs and the
assorted vendors who set up shop here for the event. Fortunatly, most of the PCs
are wearing their climate-controlled suits of armor. The sole exception is poor
Orangus, whose armor is a bit too heavy (and illegal!) to be acceptable attire
for anything that’s not a firefight. He’s wearing a respirator for the smell,
but his civvies and thick fur don’t help against the heat. The player’s vivid
description of his suffering earned him the game’s first RiPP.</p>

<p>The PCs linger for a while at the booth of an Unioc named Banjo Tabberlin<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> as
they watch an O’benn customer of his try out a Phubhar Shurikannon<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and cover
every inch of the shooting gallery’s back wall with metal stars, leaving the
paper target at the center untouched. Banjo comments that the Phubhar lot he
received today is quite above-average in quality. Only two weapons exploded so
far!</p>

<p>They talked with Banjo a bit and were interested in the capabilities of the M3
Incapacitator he showed them… but gave up on it whey they heard it cost twice
what they paid for the company APC. They ended up trading comm numbers, and went
to the food court.</p>

<p>There, Leto socialized a bit with Fulda Purrgathor, the medic of all-Ursumari
company Icewall Security. She and some of her buddies were ear-deep into large
bowls of shaved ice. Fulda was a bit insensitive in her comments that working on
any patient smaller than an ursumari was much too fiddly for her tastes, but
Leto assured her it was good practice.</p>

<p>After a while Skynet reminded the group that the keynote would start in 15
minutes. The speaker was Colonel Drake Pranger, the leader of one of the
galaxy’s top mercenary companies. Skynet paid a fortune for her officers to hear
this blowhard speak, and she didn’t want them to waste the money.</p>

<p>Before heading to the keynote the PCs decided to mingle and try to look for
contracts in the con by looking for anyone who seemed to be tied to one of the
galaxy’s major ongoing conflicts. A task at which they failed miserably due to
their lack of relevant skills. The only conflict that came to their minds was
the biggest of them all - the war between the godlike AIs of the Plenipotent
Dominion and the dark matter entities of Andromeda.</p>

<p><strong>Orangus</strong>: Hey, Cap’n, you’re an AI! Can’t you talk to the PD?</p>

<p><strong>Skynet</strong>: No. I do not wish to be assimilated.</p>

<p><strong>Orangus</strong>: Then can’t we work for the other guys?</p>

<p><strong>Skynet</strong>: No. I do not wish to destroy all baryonic life in the galaxy<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Orangus here was the recipient of the game’s first Mayhem card: “Spin
Control”. He now felt extremely driven to make the company look good, and his
efforts would result in a +1 increase in Reputation for every RiPP he had left
at the end of the session.</p>

<p>Rufus decided to appeal to a higher authority and ask Skynet if she knew of
someone who was hiring. The AI reminded him he had just acquired the contact
information of a known arms dealer. Rufus asked her to call him, and she
delegated the duty right back to him.</p>

<p>It turns out Banjo did have a hot tip for them! A big bounty was going to be
posted to the local hypernet during the keynote, so they should keep an ear out
for it. So forewarned, they moved on.</p>

<h2 id="scene-2-the-keynote-and-what-came-after">Scene 2: The Keynote, and What Came After</h2>

<p>The PCs found their seats in the improvised lecture hall. Orangus put his feet
up on a chair in the row ahead of him, only to have the tiny Esspererin seated
there take a perch on his feet instead. “Hey man, thanks for the lift!” Leto has
brought a tub of ice cream and is paying more attention to it than to the hall.</p>

<p>Rufus scans the crowd, trying to spot competing companies. He fails to recognize
any, but deduces that the huge group of Esspererin in the two rows in front of
them probably belong to the same company, as does a group of humanoids further
away wearing matching uniforms.</p>

<p>Pranger enters the stage and swaggers up to his podium like the high-level NPC
he is<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. He takes a deep breath, opens his mouth to speak… and is
interrupted by a deafening chime as every monitor in the hall, and every
handbrain in the room, flashes the alert that a very substantial bounty has been
posted for a human arms dealer named Kostavi, who has been sighted in
Mellsen-Anlied.</p>

<p>The players don’t need to roll to figure out who she is: Kostavi is quite
infamous for selling weapons to the sort of people who should never have them,
and causing lots of civilian casualties in the process. Sooner or later
something like this was bound to happen, and since the bounty is equivalent to 5
Resources, it’s just what the Avengers need to make payroll for the next few
months.</p>

<p>A lot of the keynote audience thinks the same, and <em>everyone</em> begins getting up
and rushing to their ships. At this point all players begin talking, and I begin
to employ the game’s initiative system: whoever speaks first, goes first. This
time, it’s Rufus, who engages his Supersuit’s flight mode and tries to carry Max
with him. He rolls a natural 18 on 3d6, which is a critical success.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: Pick one other PC to carry along with you.</p>

<p><strong>Rufus</strong>: I choose the bear!</p>

<p>So there he goes, carrying Max over one shoulder and Leto by the scruff of the
neck as the bear roars as loud as he can to clear a path. Orangus runs after
them, and meets his powered armor suit on the way so he can fly too.</p>

<p>With Banjo’s forewarning and their impressive die rolls, the party manages to
leave the hangar first, and is almost immediately fired upon by the Esspererin
vessel <em>Neoshka Kree</em>, crewed by an Esspee merc outfit based out of a piratical
cluster. Behind them is a crew of human piratical mercs, and behind <em>them</em> is
the huge, lumbering Icewall Security vessel <em>Advancing Ice</em>.</p>

<p>Time for some starship combat! I tell my players they’re all controlling the
actions of Skynet as she pilots the <em>Star Destroyer</em>. Their PCs are cowering in
their crash seats inside.</p>

<p>Leto’s player is very tempted to fire on the <em>Advancing Ice</em>, but gives up when
I specify how much bigger the other ship is. The group ends up engaging the
<em>Neoshka Kree</em> and firing to disable. The <em>Star Destroyer</em> takes a missile hit,
but it’s not enough to put it out of commision. The other ship is disabled, and
drifts down to the planetary surface. The PCs land on Mellsen-Anlied on their
flying APC.</p>

<h2 id="scene-3-search-and-destroy">Scene 3: Search and Destroy</h2>

<p>I ask for Perception rolls to abstract the initial search for Kostavi. They know
she’s in the city, but not exactly where. Rufus and Leto beat the TN of 15, and
both Rufus and Max draw Mayhem. Rufus gets a good card that allows him to
declare a failed roll by someone else is actually a critical success as long as
he can explain how. Max gets “Friendly Fire”.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: For your information, you can always pay a RiPP to negate a card.</p>

<p><strong>Max</strong>: Screw that, I want to see what happens!</p>

<p>So I narrate that they learn that Kostavi’s hideout is in an abandoned warehouse
in the lower levels of the city. There’s a transit elevator that should bring
them very close to it… but it’s old, rusted, and alarmingly creaky. Due to the
effect of the card, Max assures all of them the elevator is perfectly safe. As
the company engineer, he knows machines, so they all should believe him!</p>

<p>The whole party (which numbers 20 with the fireteams) walks into the
elevator. The thing’s cables snap halfway to their destination, so now every PC
must explain how they avoid taking 2d6 points of armor-ignoring damage when they
hit the bottom of the shaft<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Orangus speaks first: he wants to use his UNS I-CC powered armor to fly through
the elevator’s ceiling and hold the elevator up to slow its fall! I ask him to
make an Aerial Vehicles and an Athlethics roll. Both succeed by lots, and the
Athletics roll draws Mayhem!</p>

<p>The card is simply hilarious given the situation. Orangus is overcome with the
need to stop what he’s doing and tell a story the situation reminded him
of. Since what he’s doing is <em>saving the lives of half the company</em>, the player
wisely decides to spend a RiPP to negate this, as soon as he can stop laughing
for long enough to talk.</p>

<p><strong>Orangus</strong>: But man, was that going to be one heck of a story!</p>

<p>Shaken but mostly intact, the party heads to the warehouse where Kostavi is
hiding. Rufus scouts ahead stealthily along with his unit, and draws a Mayhem
card that he immediately uses to turn the following Perception roll into a
critical success, allowing him to find the mooks waiting in ambush and relay
their position to the rest of the unit.</p>

<p>Leto speaks first, and gets the drop on a mook not by being stealthy, but by
walking up to him and saying:</p>

<p><strong>Leto</strong>: Hello, good sir. I’m a doctor, and I couldn’t help but notice your
unhealthy pallor. Do you have a history of heart disease in your family?</p>

<p>I had him roll Deception, and the result was so high I ruled the guy lost an
action in surprise. So Leto sat on him.</p>

<p>The other mooks spring into action. One of them manages to shoot Leto for some
damage, and is vaporized by Orangus in return.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: You have a BH-209, right? The fusion reactor makes this <em>ominous
hummmmm</em> sound and a jet of plasma shoots forth. Where the enemy stood is now a
little pile of ash and a pair of smoking boots.</p>

<p><strong>Orangus</strong>: I LOVE MY JOB!!!<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>The two remaining guards suffer similar fates at the hands of the PCs’
fireteams, and once the survivor is interrogated he shows them the address of
the <em>real</em> hideout stored in his handbrain.</p>

<p>The group sends a picture of the guy to Skynet. Is he worth anything?</p>

<p><strong>Skynet</strong>: What you see here is a typical specimen of the common thug.</p>

<p>They tie him up and leave him for the police, which Skynet will call as soon as
the party is far enough away no one can pin this on them. They now know Kostavi
is on another warehouse on an even lower level of the city. Time to bag a
bounty!</p>

<h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s All, Folks!</h2>

<p>That’s where we stopped, since it was already noon. It’s fair to say everyone
had a blast. The “shout first, go first” initiative mechanic worked a lot better
than I thought it would, and the timing marks for the adventure were mostly
spot-on.</p>

<p>The Mayhem Deck was fun beyond all my expectations. The group got really lucky
with it too, drawing mostly good cards this time around. The <em>bad</em> cards did a
lot more to reshape the game and make everyone laugh, though. Let’s see how
funny they make the next session.</p>

<p>When will that be? I’m still not sure. We’re back to D&amp;D next week.  We might
alternate the two games, or wait until there’s another “gap”. I do know the
group wants to finish this adventure at some point. Orangus’ player bought the
corebook after this session, and we’ve been discussing the game online.</p>

<p>And yeah, the “Spin Control” effect happened here, giving the company +3
Reputation. We explained it as Orangus’ heroic stunt with the falling elevator
getting caught by various security cameras. Which he posed for.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This last weekend I finally got to GM in real time again! It wasn’t exactly an
in-person game, seeing as it happened over Google Hangouts, but it was the next
best thing.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing a bit of D&amp;D 5th Edition with this particular group every
Sunday morning, also over Hangouts. It so happened that the habitual GM wouldn’t
have the materials handy for a couple of weeks due to a trip, so I proposed a
session of Planet Mercenary to fill the gap and keep our momentum going. I had
just gotten the book (read my review [here][1]) and this would be a perfect
opportunity to try it out.</p>

<h2 id="character-and-company-creation">Character and Company Creation</h2>

<p>Since everyone was new to the system, I decided to set one of our two “gap”
sessions aside for creating characters. I started with a very basic overview of
the setting, and proceeded to use screen sharing to show the possible choices
for Command Package, Background and Sophont Type. The sophont type illustrations
were a big hit, particularly those of the Earth-born species.</p>

<p>I banned AI and Amorph PCs to start with, since those were marked as “Advanced”
and no one had much in the way of system experience. I’m glad I did, because in
my experience with science fiction games is that someone <em>always</em> wants to play
a robot. We ended up with an all-Earthling crew, whom we’ll get to meet shortly.</p>

<p>Point distribution was done simultaneously: I screen-shared the character sheet
for reference and answered questions along the way. Company creation was very
easy to explain: since most of the group was familiar with Ars Magica, I just
had to say it worked more or less like a Covenant. We took the suggested
starting stats to speed things up, because I knew that the next step there was
going to eat up most our time. Yes, I’m talking about <em>shopping</em>.</p>

<p>Starship selection was surprisingly quick, simply because the Dragon-class
Interdiction Cruiser looks like a Star Destroyer. It’s also pretty good for its
class, mechanically, and one of the most versatile designs they could afford. So
I was pretty happy to let them choose it as their ship. The players named it
<em>Star Destroyer</em>, of course. It has the optional gun package and an add-on set
of light shields that I let them buy. When I told them startships were piloted
by powerful AI, they promptly named their ship AI <em>Skynet</em>.</p>

<p>Buying personal equipment was… less than quick, which is something I already
expected. Using Hangouts screen-sharing to show the lists to everyone at the
same time did make it a <em>lot</em> faster than it would have been if I had to keep
passing a physical book or PDF-in-a-device around. The group got an APC so that
all players and their fireteams could ride around on the same vehicle, and spent
all the time I saved with the screen share trying to make their remaining
Supplies buy armor and weapons for all PCs after a couple of them blew mountains
of cash on expensive flying suits.</p>

<p>The finishing touches of character creation actually stretched into some
Whatsapp messaging over the week and the first hour of session 2. Here are our
results.</p>

<h3 id="company-skynets-avengers">Company: Skynet’s Avengers</h3>

<p>No one wanted to be the captain, so I was free to make one. Looking at the
mountain of pop-culture references thrown around both during general chatter and
in naming the ship and its AI, I decided that the <em>AI itself</em> would be the
Captain.</p>

<p>Skynet is a ship-scale AI whose past is a bit of a secret. It’s completely
addicted to old (or, in other words, comtemporary) Earth pop culture. All those
jokes the players made? They’re canon. Skynet named itself after the evil AI
from Terminator, named the ship Star Destroyer because it resembles a star
destroyer, and speaks like GlaDoS because it likes GlaDoS. How it managed to
liberate itself and its ship from the UNS military is still a bit of a mystery,
but it currently runs a small mercenary company (named after the Avengers). Few
other people in the galaxy (aside from the Gavs) get all the jokes.</p>

<p>The company has the default attributes of AI Rating 3, Starting Resources 9, and
Reputation 4. Players spent 10 Resources on their ship, turned the remainder
into 70 supplies, and spent every last penny of that in personal gear, which
means Skynet’s Avengers are desperate to find a job, any job, or else they won’t
be able to make payroll next month. And we all know how bad that is.</p>

<h3 id="player-characters">Player Characters</h3>

<p>Our PCs make up the officer corps for Skynet’s Avengers, and all of them hail
from Earth. I messed up a bit during fireteam creation, and they each ended up
with fireteams made up of 4 grunts. I’m leaving that as it is for now.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Max</strong>, Human/Engineer/Driver. His fireteam is the most diverse, with a
Neophant, a Ursumari, an O’benn and an Oth, all of varying specialties. The
O’benn and the Oth are the two named company members who are not from
Earth. Carries a Strohl G/G 1000 sniper rifle and wears Blue Collar armor
(which is standard for company grunts, too).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Kerchak “Orangus” Strongheart</strong>, Rilla/Quartermaster/Infantry
Grunt. Promoted to officer status when the gorilla in front of him got
blown up. An enthusiastic Heavy Weapons Guy(rilla), he carries around a BH-209
plasma cannon and wears a suit of USMF I-CC power armor. His fireteam is
similarly all-Rillas, all-Heavies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Leto “Master of Puppets”</strong>, Ursumari/Medic/Crime Boss. Like Walter White,
but a polar bear<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Leto is a highly skilled medic and a surprisingly good
liar. He also has a BH-209 plasgun, though his armor is a standard Blue Collar
suit. His fireteam is made up of four identical pink-haired human women from
the same clone family, all Medics, all named Joy. Yes, it’s a Pokemon
reference, but my mind immediately went to the Honokas of Sidonia<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> (which
are also clones, but fightier).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rufuz Leet</strong>, Purp/Ops Commander/Military Officer. Hails from a proud
lineage of decorated soldiers, wields a G/G 511 carbine and wears an EX
Supersuit, the most expensive suit of armor in the entire company. Completely
ignores how much he looks like Master Chef from HALO<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. His fireteam is
composed of three Purp Infantry named after actors from Expendables and one
neophant named Babar who acts as the voice of wisdom in the unit. Fairly
sneaky and skilled with nearly every weapon in the book.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of them are very good at fighting in addition to being skilled at what their
command package implies. None of them have much in the way of social or mental
skills, with the exception of Leto who has Deception 8.</p>

<h2 id="coming-up-next-the-damaxuri-deception">Coming Up Next: The Damaxuri Deception</h2>

<p><em>Damaxuri Deception</em> is the adventure that comes in the corebook, and it’s
intended to be an introduction to both the game’s mechanics and its philosophy
of adventure design. It laid out as a succession of scenes, each accompanied by
an estimate of how long it should take to run. I found that <em>extremely</em> useful,
as it allowed me to direct my efforts somewhat to keep things moving as they
should and to better fit our limited 9:00-12:00 time slots.</p>

<p>We’ll see how Skynet’s Avengers handled this mission in the next post!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/152691/The-Dreams-of-Ruin">Dreams of Ruin</a> aren’t a natural phenomenon - they were created by
someone (or someones) who wanted the multiverse to get a little more Chaotic
Evil. In my <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">X-COM campaign</a> it was all the work of the Ebon Masters,who make
no particular effort to hide that fact as they use the Dreams as a weapon of
conquest and a tool of terraforming. But in the original text the identity of
the people who created the Dreams is supposed to be a mystery.</p>

<p>Geoff C. Grabowski, the book’s author, mentioned in a thread over at the RPG.net
forums that you could find the real culprit from clues present in the book by
looking at the <em>Deities and Demigods</em> supplement for AD&amp;D 1st Edition. He
couldn’t mention that in the book itself because it would violate the OGL, and
was apparently reluctant to point fingers explicitly for the same reason.</p>

<p>Well, I got <em>Deities &amp; Demigods</em> during a recent DTRPG sale, and I have no legal
ties to the Dreams of Ruin, so let’s try to figure out who’s to blame for this
mess!</p>

<h2 id="clues-in-dreams-of-ruin">Clues in <em>Dreams of Ruin</em></h2>

<p>Anyone trying to look into this mystery directly will eventually come across a
vision of the Malediction that opens the book - you know, the bit with Old Woman
Crow and and the Wind. That vision was put in place to hide the true identities
of the perpetrator(s) of the Dreams, but it does make some allegories to the
actual process. Investigating the process itself yields more clues, which are
listed in a section near the end of the book. All of them are stated in AD&amp;D 1st
Edition terms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Creating the Dreams requires the abilities of a 20th-level Magic User, a
20th-level Illusionist, a 14th-level Cleric, and a 14th-level Druid. Those are
<em>minimum</em> levels - the perpetrators either had plenty of time or lots of extra
power. If one of them was a god of some sort they could even fulfill multiple
prerequisites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Illusionist was likely the mastermind, as Illusionist spells are the basis
on which the system was built.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Druid was largely responsible for designing the ecology of the Dreams and
might have used this expertise as a bargaining chip to get included.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The work involved a truly ridiculous amount of <em>wishes</em> and <em>limited wishes</em>,
among many other spell effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Four cards from the Deck of Many Things were involved. One of them was the
Moon, which grants a <em>wish</em>, which means the perpetrators might have found a
way to cheat the Deck and draw as many Moons as they wanted.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The result of the process was a single spore, created by a final <em>limited wish</em>
cast by the illusionist which brought all the other factors together. This spore
then multiplied on its own and brought forth all the other horrors in the book.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-deities-and-demigods">What’s In Deities and Demigods</h2>

<p>Knowing old D&amp;D supplements were “quirky” and actually experiencing it are two
different things. A lot of modern books try to emulate this style, but this
thing here is the genuine article. The layout and typography are readable
enough, but they give me this feeling of being amateurish. It’s not something
the authors were trying to do on purpose either, like in the Dungeon Crawl
Classics line - this really was the best they could do at the time. The
introduction also has Gary Gygax boasting about how writing the book involved
extensive consultations <em>with himself</em>, which is, uh, something.</p>

<p>I’ve heard a lot about how this book was nothing but a jumped-up bestiary, but
the introduction says exactly the opposite! It advises the GM to use the
information as reference for roleplaying and to not treat the deities as just a
collection of stats. I guess the reason they get full stat writeups is that the
concept that you didn’t need to stat everything up hadn’t yet become
popular. Which is kinda ironic considering the complaints about “games these
days” from hardline old-school adepts.</p>

<p>Anyway, the book presents several different pantheons here. Each one begins with
a very brief description of how their mortal religions operate, and follows up
with full stat blocks for what Gygax considered to be their main figures. Each
one has an illustration and a very brief description of the being in question,
usually focusing more on physical appearance and any special abilities than in
mythological information.</p>

<p>The stat blocks are different from your usual monster writeup, unless the entity
in question is an actual monster. This writeup includes ability scores as well
as a list of classes and levels that acts as a shorthand for what sort of
PC-like abilities the being in question possesses. Heroes get a similar writeup
to gods, and monsters get Ye Olde Monster Statblock.</p>

<p>Most pantheons are drawn from real-world mythology as filtered by Gygax in his
extensive consultations with himself, but my copy of the PDF also has the
pantheon of the <em>Farfhd and The Grey Mouser</em> stories and a bunch of original
nonhuman deities that would proceed to become fixtures in every future edition
of D&amp;D, like Moradin, Corellon and Gruumsh. Earlier printings of the book also
had writeups for Melniboné and the Cthulhu Mythos, which were taken out to avoid
copyright troubles.</p>

<h2 id="the-suspect-line-up">The Suspect Line-Up</h2>

<p>We’re looking here for an entity or group of entities who fulfills the following
criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Chaotic Evil alignment, or as close to it as possible. The mastermind is most
likely CE, accomplices might be NE or CN depending on their individual
personalities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is or contains at least a 20th-level Magic User, a 20th-level Illusionist, a
14th-level Cleric and a 14th-level Druid.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m assuming the information on <em>Deities &amp; Demigods</em> is basically correct, which
probably wouldn’t be true in a campaign which cared even a bit about real-world
accuracy. I’ll consider a credible suspect any listed entity that has the
requisite alignment and fulfills at least one of the level requirements. Any
pantheon from the book not mentioned here lacks a listed entity who could be a
credible suspect.</p>

<h3 id="the-native-american-mythos">The Native American Mythos</h3>

<p><strong>Coyote</strong> has the requisite Druid and Cleric levels and is Chaotic Neutral, so
he could theoretically be convinced to aid in the creation of the Dreams… but
that sounds a bit too actively malicious for him.</p>

<h3 id="the-babylonian-mythos">The Babylonian Mythos</h3>

<p>We have two suspects, but they’d need help from outside the pantheon.</p>

<p><strong>Anshar</strong> the god of darkness is CE and can play the role of the Cleric. His
ability to “catch” and store arcane spells is powerful, but I’m not sure it
would allow him to play the MU or Illusionist role, so he would need
co-conspirators.</p>

<p><strong>Nergal</strong> is NE and both a 25th-level Cleric and a 20th-level Magic User. He
sounds like he’d be on board as a helper.</p>

<h3 id="central-american-mythos">Central American Mythos</h3>

<p>Plenty of suspects to go around here!</p>

<p><strong>Quetzalcoatl</strong> seems like an unlikely suspect at first, but power-wise he’s a
single druid level short of being able to do the whole thing himself. That’s a
rounding error when it comes to greater deities. And despite being listed as
Lawful Neutral, even Gygax acknowledges it’s hard to fit him into the alignment
system, as you have several stories where he acts in a Chaotic or Evil
manner. If this was one of those times, then you can see why there would be
unbreakable measures in place to prevent others from figuring out who did it.</p>

<p>If you take inspiration from those bits of real-world Aztec mythology that say
<strong>Tetzcatlipoca</strong> is comparable to Quetzalcoatl in power, he becomes an even
likelier suspect than the Big Q, because his behavior is consistent enough to be
rated as Chaotic Evil in the book. Simply going by the supplement, though, he
lacks the levels.</p>

<p><strong>Camazotz</strong> the bat god is CE and has the necessary MU and Illusionist
levels. He’d need some help to fulfill the other roles.</p>

<p><strong>Tlazolteotl</strong> the goddess of vice is also CE and can <em>almost</em> do the whole
thing herself, lacking only a few levels of Magic User.</p>

<p>This leaves us with a very strong chance of the Dreams being the fault of these
Aztec deities! Maybe Tzazolteotl enlisted Camazotz as an accomplice; maybe it
was one of Quetzalcoatl’s Chaotic Evil moments; or maybe it was just
Tetzcatlipoca being himself. The Dreams certainly look bad enough to be the
thing that ends the Fifth Sun.</p>

<h3 id="chinese-mythos">Chinese Mythos</h3>

<p><strong>Lu Yueh</strong> the god of pestilence is CE, has 20 cleric levels and 19
MU/Illusionist levels. I’m sure he could compensate for the two missing arcane
caster levels by being the <em>god of pestilence</em>, and he could create the Dreams
if he recruited a high-level druid. No likely druid presents himself in the
pantheon, though.</p>

<h3 id="egyptian-mythos">Egyptian Mythos</h3>

<p><strong>Set</strong> might be listed as Lawful Evil, but the Dreams sound right up his
alley. He’s a 30th-level illusionist, which <em>might</em> compensate for his lack of
Magic User levels… Or he could probably recruit a powerful enough wizard and
druid through his infectious alignment change ability. Or you could stick by the
alignment restriction and have him look at the Dreams and go “not even I would
do that”.</p>

<h3 id="finnish-mythos">Finnish Mythos</h3>

<p>The cast of the Kalevala gives us our second group of suspects who could have
done it without help from outside the pantheon.</p>

<p><strong>Tuonetar</strong> the goddess of the underworld looks like a prime suspect, being CE
and only lacking Druid levels. If she did it, then her husband <strong>Tuoni</strong> was
likely involved as the Cleric.</p>

<p><strong>Kiputtyto</strong> the demigoddess of sickness has the necessary Druidic expertise,
so she would complete Team Evil for the Finnish Dreams of Ruin.</p>

<h3 id="greek-mythos">Greek Mythos</h3>

<p>Surprisingly few ideal candidates present themselves here, but a couple of them
make for a really tempting picture.</p>

<p><strong>Hecate</strong> is listed as Lawful Evil… but she has the requisite arcane power
<em>and</em> can cast arcane spells without limit, making her the only deity in the
book who could produce unlimited <em>wishes</em> without cheating the Deck of Many
Things. She’s also powerful enough as a Cleric to fill that role too, and would
need only a Druid helper.</p>

<p><strong>Circe</strong> is labeled as Chaotic Evil and has the requisite Druid levels, so she
would be the ideal henchwoman.</p>

<p>A NE or CE Hecate teaming up with Circe make an awfully evocative Team Evil for
a Greek version of the Dreams.</p>

<h3 id="nehwon-mythos">Nehwon Mythos</h3>

<p>These are the deities of the <em>Farfhd &amp; Grey Mouser</em> stories. Most of them tend
to the Neutral, but if the CE <strong>Gods of Trouble</strong> teamed up with the CE <strong>Nehwon
Earth God</strong> they’d have all they need to unleash the Dreams.</p>

<h3 id="norse-mythos">Norse Mythos</h3>

<p><strong>Loki</strong> certainly has the inclination, but by himself he can only fill the
Illusionist role. <strong>Hel</strong> can fill the Cleric role, but they’d need outside
help for the Druid and MU slots.</p>

<h2 id="and-the-culprit-is">And the Culprit Is…</h2>

<p>Gee, we ended up with quite a big list of suspects there, didn’t we? Who should
we finger in this lineup of cosmic evil?</p>

<p>Personally, I’m disinclined to consider mythological crossovers, so let’s strike
out any pantheon who doesn’t have enough listed suspects to produce the Dreams
without outside help. That leaves only the Aztec, Greek, Finnish and Newhon Gods
as possible culprits. Mr. Grabowski has made use of plenty of Aztec and Sword
and Sorcery influences on his work before, so I think I’m on to something here.</p>

<p>Let us next consider the base traits of the Dreams. They spread like a disease;
and they thin the barriers between the targeted plane and the “evil astral”,
which is to say the underworlds where demons and other horrors come from. They
are as opposed to Law as they are to Good; A Lawful Evil interloper is as likely
to be considered an enemy of the forest as a Chaotic Good one.</p>

<p>With all of that in mind I have to say my choice for culprits goes to the
<strong>Finnish Gods</strong> - more specifically, Tuonetar, Tuoni and Kiputtyto working in
concert. The first two are Greater Gods of an evil underworld. Kiputtyto is a
demigoddess of sickness and has Druid levels, which fits the clue about the
druid being at the start of this article. The Kalevala pantheon also has a
history of being a source of D&amp;D deities, with Loviatar and Mielikki being from
there originally.</p>

<p>The Aztec gods come in at a close second, with the most probable cause there
being a collaboration between Tzazolteotl and Camazotz due to their compatible
alignment and stats. It’s not hard to fit the Dreams as an attempt to end the
Fifth Sun if you read up on Aztec Mythology on Wikipedia, with more reliable
sources likely providing better material, and the imagery of Aztec-influenced
Dreams of Ruin sure does seem evocative. But going from just <em>Deities &amp;
Demigods</em>, the two deities in question seem to lack the “pestilence” portfolio,
which puts a slight dent in their credibility.</p>

<p>The Hecate/Circe team lost out because Hecate is listed as Lawful and the notes
don’t contradict it like they do with the Big Q. And the Nehwon gods lost out
because while the Gods of Trouble seem to be perfect fits the Earth God wants to
return the earth to a molten state, which doesn’t seem to be very much in line
with how the Dreams work. I’m sure someone interested in using that pantheon as
the source could scare up a suitably evil druid from the setting, though.</p>

<p>So did I get close, Mr. Grabowski?</p>
