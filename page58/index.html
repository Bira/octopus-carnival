        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Esta é a versão em português do post <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/28/adapting-video-games.html">Adapting Videogames</a>. Siga o link para
ler a versão em inglês!</p>

<p>Antes de eu começar todo aquele negócio de Dragon’s Dogma, eu gostaria de
discutir o próprio processo de adaptar um video game. Vai me ajudar a explicar
minhas decisões.</p>

<p>O excelente <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/products/gurps-adaptations">GURPS Adaptations</a> contém muitas informações valiosas sobre como
adaptar ficção tradicional para uma campanha de GURPS. Muitas delas são
igualmente aplicáveis à adaptação de um video game, mas eu sinto que há algumas
considerações adicionais igualmente importantes. Elas são relacionadas ao
<em>gameplay</em>.</p>

<p>“Gameplay” é um termo que engloba tudo o que o jogador faz em um video game,
assim como os mecanismos que governam essas ações. Jogos diferentes lhe dão
diferentes níveis de acesso a esses mecanismos. Um jogo de plataforma permite
que você desenvolva uma intuição sobre a distância máxima dos seus saltos, e um
RPG eletrônico te mostra uma quantidade imensa de números.</p>

<p>Ficção não tem “gameplay”. Mesmo o mais longo dos romances de fantasia com a
mais detalhada descrição de seu sistema de magia nunca vai fazer com que seus
leitores façam mais do que ler o texto para descobrir o que acontece a
seguir. Video games são o exato oposto disso. Mesmo o mais imersivo e narrativo
dos video games vai sempre exigir que você preste tanta atenção ao gameplay
quanto à história e ao cenário.</p>

<p>Se você acha que isso lembra muito o processo de conversão de um sistema de RPG
para o outro, está começando a entender!</p>

<p>Essencialmente, o processo de adaptar um video game para uma campanha de RPG de
mesa apresenta todas as dificuldades de adaptar a ficção <em>e também</em> todas as
dificuldades de converter material entre sistemas diferentes!</p>

<p>Quanto mais transparentes as mecânicas originais do jogo são, paradoxalmente,
mais difíceis elas tornam o esforço de adaptação. Ao adaptar mecânicas, quer de
um video game quer de outro RPG, é muito fácil cair na armadilha de tentar
convertê-las tão detalhadamente quanto possível. Isso pode ser um exercício
intelectual interessante, mas raramente gera um resultado simples e prático.</p>

<p>Minha estratégia preferida é confiar nas forças do sistema “de destino” tanto
quanto possível, adaptando a ficção e tentando recriar as mesmas sensações
passadas pelas mecânicas originais sem travar nos detalhes. Sempre que as
mecânicas conflitam, a ficção tem precedência. Com jogos que são parte de uma
franquia, eu escolho um subconjunto das informações do cenário e das mecânicas
que pintam o retrato mais coerente (ou pelo menos o retrato do qual eu gosto
mais).</p>

<p>No final, eu espero ter uma moldura de campanha que é divertida de jogar e que
se encaixa no idioma do GURPS. E espero que condordem comigo sobre o resultado
:).</p>

<p>This is the third and final post in a mini-series about bringing the peoples of
Tamriel to a GURPS fantasy game. This post deals with anyone who’s neither a
human nor an elf.</p>

<p>Scholars from the Empire or the Aldmeri dominion tend to call these people
“Beast-Folk”, both because many of them bear an obvious resemblance to some sort
of animal and because these exalted nations tend to view them as somewhat
less than civilized. Like everyone else, though, they have rich cultures and
long histories. They are also quite well-adapted to their home environments.</p>

<h2 id="argonian-20-points">Argonian (20 Points)</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Argonian_Female_2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Argonians (or Saxhleel, as they call themselves) are a reptilian people native
to the swampy region of Black Marsh. They resemble scaly humans with a tail and
a lizard head, and sometimes have feathers or horns as well. Their scales come
in various shades of dark brown, gray or green, sometimes marked with patterns
unique to the individual.</p>

<p>Well-adapted to their native environment, Argonians are amphibious and highly
resistant to disease. They’re known as experts in guerilla warfare, having had
to defend their homes against foreign invasions many times in Tamriel’s long and
convoluted history.</p>

<p>Argonian adventurers thrive in flooded environments. Those native to Black Marsh
are commonly Scouts, Barbarians, or Thieves with some supplemental wilderness
survival training. An all-Argonian party can go in underwater adventures without
any special magic or equipment!</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Amphibious {10}; Doesn’t Breathe (Gills, -50%) {10}; Resistant
to Disease +3 {5}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Cold-Blooded {-5}.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>: Tail; Body and head armor needs to be adapted to accommodate the
tail and unusual head shape. This usually doesn’t cost extra, but might restrict
their usage of looted armor.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Argonians are the target of prejudice in several provinces of
Tamriel, like Morrowind and Skyrim. In games taking place mostly in those
provinces, they would have Social Stigma (Minority Group).</p>

<h2 id="khajit-25-points">Khajit (25 points)</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Khajiit_Female_1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Khajit require surprisingly little explanation for those who are already
familiar with Dungeon Fantasy. They’re Catfolk! While an individual Khajit’s
appearance is <em>technically</em> influenced by the configuration of Nirn’s two moons
when they are born, that’s mostly an attempt by the franchise’s writers to
“explain” why the design for playable Khajit characters went from “humans with
funny face tattoos” to something that matches the description of DF Catfolk
pretty much exactly.</p>

<p>Khajit hail from the tropical region of Elsweyr (pronounced “Elsewhere”). This
province is about equally split into an inland expanse or arid badlands, and a
lush coastal region criss-crossed by extensive river basins. The former is
inhabited by fierce nomadic warriors, the later by sugar cane plantation owners,
farm workers, and urban merchants. Those plantations produce Moon Sugar, the
region’s chief export. Moon Sugar’s properties vary a lot depending on what
source you’re consulting: they seem to range from “it’s just sugar” to “it’s
crystallized catnip”. In either case it has many more or less legitimate
culinary and alchemical uses. It can also be distilled into Skooma, a drink
that’s definitely closer to the “catnip” end of the spectrum and banned in most
regions of Tamriel.</p>

<p>Khajit adventurers tend to prefer “skirmisher” professions like Scouts,
Swashbucklers and Thieves. Being naturally equipped with claws, they also put
greater emphasis in unarmed combat than most, and so also count many Martial
Artists among their number.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Catfall {10}; Sharp Claws {5}; Sharp Teeth {1}; Fur {1}; Night
Vision 8 {8}.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong>: Tail (not prehensile, and easily tucked into armor).</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: GMs who prefer to use the default Catfolk statistics for
Khajit are free to do so, either in place of these or alongside them (as a
different variety). Addiction to Skooma is a -15 point disadvantage: it’s
incapacitating, highly addictive, and illegal. Addiction to Moon Sugar, if the
GM decides it has drug-like properties at all, is worth -5 points in those
places where it is illegal, and 0 points otherwise. These can apply to <em>anyone</em>,
not just Khajit, no matter what the Altmer try to tell you.</p>

<h2 id="others">Others</h2>

<p>Many allusions are made in Elder Scrolls lore to other “beast-folk” species,
though these have never been playable in the games. A lot of them show up as
enemies, though.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Standard goblins and ogres exist in Tamriel, and are viewed here much as they
are in any other setting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Giants have roamed Skyrim since time immemorial, and maintain a wary
relationship with its human inhabitants. They have a Paleolithic tribal
culture and are known for herding mammoths.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The simian Imga share Valenwood with the Bosmer. The Alessian Order that
eventually created the First Empire based their religion on the teachings of
an Imga prophet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Hist are sapient <em>trees</em>, said to be the oldest form of sapient life in
Tamriel. Most of them are located in Black Marsh, and are at the center of
Argonian culture and society.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And so on, and so forth. Throughout various places and times you can also find
snake-people (Lamias), slug-people (Sloads), fox-people (Lilmothiit), Minotaurs,
and so on. Like elves, feel free to introduce a new variety every time your
players think they got it all figured out.</p>

</figure>

<p>It’s been a while since my last post on the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/">Let’s Read Hell’s Rebels</a> series,
but the good thing about maintaining my own site is that there are no
externally-imposed deadlines and a project is only over when I say it’s over! So
let’s keep going!</p>

<p>“Turn of the Torrent” is the second adventure in the path. It expects Pathfinder
characters to be 4th level when they start it, and 7th when they finish
it. Since I imagine a starting Dungeon Fantasy delver is equal to a 7th level
d20 character, the challenges here should still be well within the capabilities
of any party that went through Adventure One.</p>

<h2 id="a-small-recap">A small recap</h2>

<p>As always, check out the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/">project page</a> for links to the previous
installments, but let’s summarize what happened so far. It has been 18 months,
after all.</p>

<p>The Hell’s Rebels campaign takes place in the city of Kintargo, located in the
devil-worshipping fascist nation of Cheliax. The official line is that they’re
only “taking inspiration” from the extremely organized nature of the Nine
Hells<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but everyone knows the truth. Kintargo in particular has always been
particularly ornery about all this, having only been annexed after a long and
bitter struggle. Leading that struggle were the Silver Ravens, a group of rebels
who have achieved a sort of semi-legendary status in the mind of the citizens of
present-day Kintargo.</p>

<p>Our main villain is a man named Barzilai Thrune, a narcissistic sociopath who
delights in grandstanding, engendering acts of large-scale performative cruelty
against minorities, and surrounding himself with equally despicable
lackeys<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. He found out Kintargo is an auspicious site for a ritual that could
turn him into a minor god, and got himself appointed Lord Mayor of the
city. After having anyone who could oppose him killed, he’s been amusing himself
by making ever more absurd proclamations and otherwise oppressing his
constituency. All of them will die when the ritual is done, so why worry?</p>

<p>The PCs get caught up in all of this and by the end of Adventure One find
themselves leading the group that has the best chance of freeing Kintargo from
Thrune’s grasp: the reborn Silver Ravens. In fact, they’re now big enough that
their current coffee-house-basement hideout is getting a bit cramped.</p>

<h2 id="proclamation-the-ninth">Proclamation The Ninth</h2>

<p>The adventure kicks off with Barzilai’s Ninth proclamation, which targets the
Hellknight Order of the Torrent. All their assets are confiscated and their
members declared outlaws. Anyone caught harboring one of them will be similarly
declared a criminal.</p>

<p>The Hellknight orders are kinda like elite law-enforcement agencies associated
with the government of Cheliax. Most Hellknights are as evil as the name
implies, but until recently there was one notable exception.</p>

<p>The Order of the Torrent was a search-and-rescue unit based out of Kintargo, and
was the only one composed mostly of Lawful Good folks. Predictably, it was also
by far the smallest and less politically influent of the orders, with only 23
members total. Barzilai targets them here because he wants to gift their assets
to his buddies from the Order of the Rack<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. By the time the proclamation is
announced his underlings have pretty much finished the Order of the Torrent off.</p>

<p>After this bit of exposition we get a table of rumors that mostly serves to
foreshadow missions the PCs will undertake later in the adventure, with a false
rumor planted in there that will make them distrust the Order of the Torrent if
they believe in it. There’s also a bit about the toll for Kintargo’s main bridge
being drastically increased, which is not something that would inconvenience the
PCs overmuch but which will cause plenty of unrest among the citizens.</p>

<h2 id="a-cousins-plea">A Cousin’s Plea</h2>

<p>Once the party is done with rumors, they’re contacted by a woman named Setrona
Sabinus, current proprietor of one of Kintargo’s oldest taverns, the Tooth and
Nail. She wants then to find her missing cousin Octavio, who happens to be the
leader of the Torrent. He’s gone missing since the proclamation, and she
imagines he might be laying low in a remote shrine located to the south of the
city.</p>

<p>Optionally, the GM can have Setrona ask them to first look for her cousin in a
sanctioned excruciation that will take place that day, since she doesn’t
actually know if he’s been captured or not. Unlike the unsanctioned variety the
PCs dealt with in the previous adventure, this one is conducted and guarded by
actual dottari guards and Rack Hellknights (four of each).</p>

<p>Octavio isn’t here, but a lower-ranking member of the Torrent is. PCs can try to
rouse the crowd and browbeat the guards into postponing the proceedings, or they
can charge and start a fight.</p>

<p>This section also includes a note on how these frequent excruciations will
actually bolster support for the Ravens. At some point Barzilai will realize
this and stop them.</p>

<h3 id="conversion-notes">Conversion Notes</h3>

<p>The four dottari guards wear mail suits and carry halberds and bows. The Rack
armigers have plate, large shields and broadswords. Building them with the
Squire template plus 25 points or so seems about right: they should be strong
and skilled physical combatants.</p>

<p>None of the two groups will fight to the death - in fact, they’re not all that
united. The dottari will perform a fighting retreat if one of them drops, and
will rout if two of them fall. The knights will retreat as soon as one of them
suffers a major wound. Either group will leave the other to its fate when that
happens. This means even a Pathfinder party can make it out of this CR 9
encounter alive if they are lucky and focus fire on one opponent at a time. DF
delvers should have quite a bit less trouble surviving the encounter, though
it’s no longer the cakewalk their last excruciation was.</p>

<h2 id="shrine-of-saint-senex">Shrine of Saint Senex</h2>

<p>This is the shrine where Octavio is supposed to be hiding out. Most of it is
underground, but there’s a small above-ground area inhabited by two
hippie-looking oracles.</p>

<p>The pair is all of remains of the saint’s cult. They know Octavio is hiding
underground, but the PCs must first gain their thrust. Bringing Setrona along
will make this much easier. Even if the PCs manage to get a friendly reaction
out of the oracles, though, they still insist the party go through the “trials”
awaiting them underground to prove they are worthy.</p>

<p>There are two rooms in the temple’s underground. The first contains a simple
puzzle, with a fight against a rope golem if the party gets it wrong. The second
contains Octavio, hiding out in a crypt full of mummified drowned sailors. He’ll
mistake the party for Thrune agents unless he recognizes them using the
campaign’s notoriety mechanics, or unless Setrona is with them. Yes, this
mini-dungeon can be entirely “solved” without a fight if the party brings
Setrona along.</p>

<p>Octavio Sabinus is a Lawful Good Hellknight<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, and he will be amenable to
joining the Ravens as long as the PCs can prove to him that the group is a)
capable of opposing Thrune without always resorting to violence and b) making
sure his men are safe. To that end he asks the party to rescue those men from
the Old Kintargo Holding House, which is detailed later in the book. He will
remain hiding in the crypt until that is done, and will join the Ravens as a
unique ally when the PCs complete the mission. Completing it in a <em>subtle</em>
manner will make him even more loyal to the cause.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-and-review">Analysis and Review</h2>

<p>The paragraph above is exactly where part 1 of the adventure ends. Yes, it’s
basically 90% background info and exposition. The playable part consists of an
optional combat encounter which the book doesn’t recommend including and what’s
essentially a one-room dungeon bookended by two friendly chats assuming the PCs
do the smart thing and bring Setrona along. It could take less than half a
session, start to finish.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more detail about the rescue mission Octavio wants the PCs to
perform, but even that is only presented in part two. The general verbosity and
somewhat poor organization I’ve seen in official Pathfinder adventures rears its
head again.</p>

<p>The optional brawl against the dottari and armigers is somewhat easier for DF
delvers, and would be a good bit of fun if your group is in the mood to kick
some fascist ass. If they’re anxious to get on with the main story it’s best to
skip the encounter, have Setrona invite herself to go with the party and get to
the talk with Octavio as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We’ll read through Part 2 in the next post in this series.</p>

<p>This is the second post in a series about the bringing peoples of Tamriel to a

<h2 id="elves-in-tamriel">Elves in Tamriel</h2>

<p>As it happens in most fantasy settings, the Elves of Tamriel<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> are a bit
taller than its humans on average, and have large almond-shaped eyes and pointy
ears. They’re also more inherently magical than humans, though that extra magic
tends to conform itself to the environment a given elven people occupies over
time.</p>

<p>Like humans, each elven people is associated with a different region of Tamriel,
briefly described in their template. Each template also includes “typical”
cultural traits and adventuring professions for a native of that region, which
could apply to anyone born there.</p>

<p>Most elven people live much longer than humans, but in a typical Dungeon Fantasy
campaign that’s not worth any points<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="altmer-25-points">Altmer (25 Points)</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-High_Elf_Male_1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>High Elves in all settings tend to have a reputation as snobs, and these guys
are no exception. Altmer are on average taller than humans, with golden skin and
white or golden hair. Their eyes are usually gold, amber or green in color.</p>

<p>Altmer are the <em>original</em> elves, at least according to their own traditions. All
the other elven peoples originated from groups of Altmer dissidents who left
their homeland of Summerset Isle and migrated elsewhere. While individual High
Elves vary a lot in their outlook, the highly stratified society of Summerset
Island is founded on the idea that they’re better than everyone else.</p>

<p>Altmer religion teaches they are the direct descendants of gods who were tricked
into giving up their divinity so the world could be created. They ruled a
continent-spanning empire in Tamriel long before humans arrived on the scene,
and the islands don’t lack for extremists who want to bring the good old days
back at the expense of everyone else. The latest of these are the fascist
Thalmor, who by the events of Skyrim are alarmingly close to conquering Tamriel.</p>

<p>The younger generations tend to be much more egalitarian and open-minded, as do
Altmer of all ages who live outside of Summerset. Their innate facility with
magic and the wide availability of quality training in Summerset means Altmer
adventurers are commonly Wizards or members of other spellcasting professions
(like, say, <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/19/characters-magic-archer.html">Magic Archers</a>). Even High Elves who are nominally knights or
swashbucklers know a few spells.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Magery 1 {15}; Energy Reserve (Magical) 3 {9}; Better Power
Items {1}.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Some level of Intolerance is extremely common among Thalmor
members, and even those Altmer who oppose their ideology might still be prone to
bouts of well-meaning condescension that translate into an Odious Personal
Habit.</p>

<h3 id="bosmer-25-points">Bosmer (25 points)</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Wood_Elf_Male_2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Bosmer or Wood Elves call the temperate, heavily-forested province of Valenwood
their home. Their appearance and behavior are pretty much those of cliche wood
elves from other settings: they’re all about archery and protecting their forest
homes.</p>

<p>Many Valenwood Bosmer go even beyond the cliche by becoming members of the Green
Pact, a religious philosophy that exhorts them to avoid harming plants and
natural environments, never take the shape of beasts, and never kill
wastefully. Green Pact followers are strict carnivores who feel morally
obligated to eat or otherwise make use everything they kill - for the most
extreme among them, that includes <em>people</em>. They can’t make any objects from
plant matter, but can use those made by others just fine.</p>

<p>Scouts and Druids are by far the most popular professions for Bosmer
adventurers.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Animal Empathy {5}; Animal Friend {5}; Forest Guardian 2 {10};
Resistant to Poison +3 {5}.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Disciplines of Faith (Green Pact) is worth -15 points and is
common in Valendood proper. Green Pact extremists also have Odious Personal
Habit (Cannibal) for another -15 points and a -3 to reactions from anyone who is
not similarly inclined. This should probably be restricted to NPCs. Bosmer PCs
might also opt to take plain old Sense of Duty (Nature) instead or not take any
of these disadvantages at all, particularly if they were raised outside of
Valenwood.</p>

<h3 id="dunmer-20-points">Dunmer (20 points)</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Dark_Elf_Male_2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Dunmer, also known as Dark Elves, have ash-colored skin, black, dark brown or
white hair, and red or amber eyes. They hail from the volcanic land of
Morrowind, which they share with giant mushrooms, giant insects, and a whole lot
of ash. They are widely known as fierce warriors and aggressive spellcasters,
shaped by their harsh environment and cutthroat politics.</p>

<p>Morrowind is dominated by four noble houses who divide the important functions
of society among themselves. Needless to say, they constantly scheme against
each other: this is a realm whose premier law enforcement agency is a guild of
assassins. They spent much of their history worshipping a pantheon that was
basically an ascended adventuring party. After the events of <strong>Morrowind</strong> they
mostly revert back to their old gods. In both cases ancestor worship remains an
important component of their religion.</p>

<p>Dunmer adventurers tend to be Knights and Wizards, or professions that combine
both (like the Mystic Knights from Pyramid #3/13). Thieves and Assassins (or
even Ninja!) are also common. Your typical Dunmer wizard tends to prefer
elements other than fire for their damage spells, since they expect to be
slinging those at other Dunmer in the course of their many violent
intrigues. Their tradition of ancestor worship means necromancy is looked upon a
lot more favorably in Morrowind than it is elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Damage Resistance (Limited, Heat/Fire -40%) 5 {15}; Magery 0
{5}.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Getting your PCs tangled in Dunmer House politics is an
excellent way to introduce all sorts of social traits like Enemies, Allies,
Secrets, Patrons and Contacts in a game that didn’t include them previously.</p>

<h3 id="orsimer-21-points">Orsimer (21 points)</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Orc_Male_1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>In Tamriel, Orcs are Elves too! They were almost universally reviled for a long
time, but their loyal service to the Empire over the years earned them
acceptance. They look big, green, and tusky, and unlike other Mer live about as
long as humans.</p>

<p>The orcish homeland isn’t an official province, but rather a series of mountain
ranges that falls within High Rock, Skyrim and Valenwood. Their capital is the
city of Orsinium, which has been sacked and rebuilt multiple times in different
locations throughout the history of Tamriel. Traditional orcish culture makes
Nords seem like peace-loving softies. They basically worship the God of Having A
Chip on Your Shoulder.</p>

<p>Orcish adventurers favor big, brawny professions like Knight and Barbarian,
though orcish Artificers are also surprisingly common and tend to specialize
either in smithing or in alchemy.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Focused Fury {1}; Great Rage 1 {20}.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Both advantages above are from Dungeon Fantasy Denizens:
Barbarians. If the campaign takes place in a time or place where orcs are
particularly reviled, they would also have an appropriate Social Stigma. Like
Nords, though, orcish Barbarians in campaigns taking place in their homeland
aren’t considered a Minority Group. Some level of Berserk is quite common,
though.</p>

<h3 id="other-elves">Other Elves</h3>

<p>The templates above are just for the elves that have been traditionally playable
in Elder Scrolls games. There are many, many more:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In Tamriel, dwarves are elves! The Dwemer vanished way back in the First Age
and left a whole bunch of extensive, steam-powered underground complexes whose
advanced machinery is <em>still</em> pumping after all these millenia.</li>
  <li>The Falmer, or Snow Elves, dominated Skyrim at the dawn of the First Age and
were displaced by the conquering Nords. This led to an ill-fated deal with the
Dwemer that eventually turned most of them into blind cave-dwelling cannibals.</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual for Dungeon Fantasy, every time your PCs think they know all elven
subtypes, feel free to introduce a couple more.</p>

<p>It appears someone finally took me up on my offer to write a more detailed post
on any aspects of my <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2-18/09/03/one-post-skyrim.html">One-Post Skyrim</a> adaptation. The requested topic were
racial templates, so this is what I’m going to write about it here.</p>

<p>Scholars in Tamriel tend to divide its peoples into three main classifications:
“Men”, “Mer” and “Beast Folk”. This pretty much means Humans, Elves, and
Everyone Else, and as usual for this kind of medieval-ish scholarship is as much
a political construct as a biological one. This post deals with humans.</p>

<p>My primary source for this article are the wonderful <a href="http://uesp.net">Unofficial Elder Scrolls
Pages</a>, which have detailed descriptions of the lore and mechanics for all
games in the franchise<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="humans-in-tamriel">Humans in Tamriel</h2>

<p>Humans, being humans, don’t have any “mandatory” traits and as such their
“templates” technically cost 0 points. Each of the human peoples described here
is associated with a specific region of Tamriel where it makes up the majority
of the population, so their descriptions also include a bit of info on those
provinces and a small list of traits considered typical for their culture and
common adventuring professions.</p>

<p>It’s entirely possible for a human character to not have any of their culture’s
“stereotypical” traits, or to have an entirely different set more in line with
the region they actually grew up in. And the list of common adventuring
professions in no way restricts the professions a character may choose from. If
you want to be a Nord Wizard or a Breton Ninja, go for it!</p>

<h3 id="bretons">Bretons</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Breton_Female_2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Bretons are humans native from the province of High Rock, the region of Tamriel
that most resembles your typical Arthurian pastiche. They are commonly
fair-skinned, with hair that ranges from black to blond. Many demonstrate a
remarkable facility with (and resistance to) magic, which is alternatively
attributed to their ancient druidic traditions or to elven blood depending on
who’s doing the attribution.</p>

<p>The most common way for your average High Rock citizen to go up in life is to
impress a noble from its many squabbling fiefs by performing meritorious deeds.
High Rock is a big exporter of questing Knights and Holy Warriors, and of
spellcasters who take on Druidic trappings.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Magery and Magic Resistance (Improved) are extremely common among
the natives of High Rock.</p>

<h3 id="imperials">Imperials</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Imperial_Male_2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Imperials hail from the region of Cyrodiil, right in the middle of Tamriel. They
are called that because in most Elder Scrolls games their homeland is also the
seat of the Empire.</p>

<p>The Empire is the third political entity to bear this name in Tamriel’s
history. It’s a sophisticated, cosmopolitan society whose seat of power is
located in a majestic city and whose hegemony is ensured by a combination of
diplomacy, trade, and the military might of its infantry legions. In other
words, they are basically off-brand Romans.</p>

<p>Imperial adventurers who hail from the ranks of the legions are most often
Knights or battle Wizards. Other popular delver professions are Scholars,
Clerics and Bards. The “visiting wise man from Cyrodiil” looking for a lost
ruin is common enough to have become something of a cliche.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Imperials have a reputation for being well-spoken and
charismatic. They often have Charisma, Born War Leader, Business Acumen or
Smooth Operator, as well as points in the skills boosted by those talents.</p>

<h3 id="nords">Nords</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Nord_Female_1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Nords are our off-brand Vikings, as fond of song as they are of fighting. We
learned plenty about their homeland of Skyrim in my <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2-18/09/03/one-post-skyrim.html">last post</a>.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Skyrim have a greater distrust of magic than those of most
other provinces, and prefer facing their foes head-on. As such, Knight and
Barbarian are some of the most common adventurer professions for them. Bards are
also quite popular, both as entertainers and as keepers of history.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Nord barbarians from Skyrim <em>don’t</em> carry a Social Stigma in
campaigns that take place there, and should replace that with 10 points in other
disadvantages. Intolerance (Magic Users) or Compulsive Carousing fit the
stereotype. Some level of Temperature Tolerance (Cold) isn’t out of place in
even the most “urban” Nord.</p>

<h3 id="redguards">Redguards</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Redguard_Male_1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Redguards are tall, well-built humans with dark skin and curly black or red
hair. They landed in the arid province of Hammerfell, and made if their home
over the centuries. Their culture seems to take inspiration from many different
African sources, but ends up looking mostly Moorish, at least superficially.</p>

<p>Redguards are know as the most talented warriors in Tamriel, which is saying a
lot given the continent also has Orcs and Nords in it. They make better
skirmishers and independent agents than rank and file troops, and during most of
the games have a long history of loyal service to the imperial line of Tiber
Septim.</p>

<p>Redguard adventurers most often belong to the fightier
professions. Swashbucklers and Scouts are the most common, with Martial Artists
and Knights following close behind.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: The most iconic Redguard trait is Combat Reflexes! Redguards also
prize skill with the sword, so even less martial Redguard adventurers are likely
to have some training in that area.</p>

<h3 id="other-humans">Other Humans</h3>

<p>These four human origins are just the ones that are playable in most of the
Elder Scrolls games. Several others are mentioned but not traditionally
playable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Nedes had a large civilization in the time before the First Age of
Tamriel, which entered into decline and was eventually absorbed by several
other of the playable cultures.</li>
  <li>The silver-skinned Kothringi of Black Marsh are said to have died out from the
Khanaten Flu in the middle Second Age.</li>
  <li>The neighboring continent of Akavir is home to a large human civilization who
once successfully invaded and conquered Tamriel, starting its Second Age. In
keeping witht he “swipe from real world cultures” theme, the Akaviri are
off-brand Imperial Japanese.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tabletop games set far enough into the past could certainly allow for Nede or
Kothringi PCs, and Akaviri PCs would be plausible at almost any time.</p>
