            <p>This is our third and final post on drakes, covering the two species that appear
in the Monster Vault but not on the Monster Manual. It’s is part of a series! Go
<a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<h2 id="ambush-drake">Ambush Drake</h2>

<p>This species seem to be a Monster Vault original. At least, it doesn’t seem to
appear on any of the Monster Manuals. According to the MV, Ambush Drakes “roam
the plains” and frequently attack lone travelers or even whole
caravans. No mention seems to be made of domesticated ambush drakes.</p>

<p>These Medium drakes are Level 6 Skirmishers with 71 HP, making them slightly
more dangerous than even rage drakes. They run at speed 6, and fly at speed 4
(clumsy). They’re also trained in Stealth. This tells me they likely use their
flight ability to scout their surroundings or to silently approach unwary prey
from above, but when they fight it’s with feet on the ground.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a claw, which can also be employed in a Shifting Strike
that allows the drake to shift 1 square before or after the attack. When
bloodied, they grow Ravenous and gain the ability to shift 2 squares towards a
bloodied enemy as an at-will minor action.</p>

<h2 id="bloodseeker-drake">Bloodseeker Drake</h2>

<p>These Medium drakes first appear on the Monster Manual 2. As their name implies,
bloodseekers have a keen sense of smell that’s specially attuned to
blood. Domesticated specimens are prized for their tracking ability and used as
hunting and patrol animals, but they get a bit hard to control when in the
presence of too much blood.</p>

<p>Bloodseeker Drakes are Level 4 Soldiers with 53 HP. They run with speed 6, and
are trained in Perception. They attack with a bite that does extra damage
against bloodied targets, and if a bloodied enemy adjacent to the drake shifts,
they can make a bite as an opportunity attack against that enemy. This is useful
because shifts don’t draw such attacks normally.</p>

<p>The MM2 version has a few additional traits that were removed - it was immune to
fear while within 2 squares of an ally, and had an extra +5 to track bloodied
creatures on top of its Perception training. I don’t see any problem in
reinstating these abilities if you want to. Them being gone seems to be more due
to a general hardening of the “only show combat-relevant information in stat
blocks” stance in the MV than due to any balance concerns.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>This ended up being a short article, since only those two species didn’t appear
in the first Monster Manual. I like the bloodseekers, but ambush drakes feel a
bit context-less to me. “Wild creature that attacks on sight” is not exactly
something that stands out in D&amp;D, you know? Giving them a function when tamed by
humanoids would help giving them some more flavor.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>In this post we’ll continue to look at drakes, covering the rest of the ones
present in the MM.</p>

<h2 id="pseudodragon">Pseudodragon</h2>

<p>Ever since Kitty Pride from the X-Men got her pint-sized pet dragon, lots of
people have wanted one for their own characters. D&amp;D 3.x finally granted that
wish by introducing pseudodragons as a familiar option in one of its early
sourcebooks. They return here as a type of drake, being of Small size, and are
present in both books.</p>

<p>While needlefang drakes are just “cat-sized”, pseudodragons pretty much <em>are</em>
cats, at least personality-wise. Also of note is the fact that they’re really
smart! The MM version has Int 6, and the MV equivalent not only has Int 9 but
also has two languages listed in its stat block (Common and Draconic). They’re
both still classed as Natural Beasts, so you could interpret that as meaning
they can understand these languages but aren’t capable of speaking
them. According to the MM, they purr, hiss, chirp and growl in the same
situations a cat would emit each of these noises.</p>

<p>In the wild, they’re predators and scavengers, but usually stick to small prey
and don’t attack animals unless threatened. Their high intelligence makes them
highly valued as pets, as well.</p>

<p>MM pseudodragons are Level 3 Lurkers with 40 HP. They walk with speed 4 and fly
with speed 8 (hover). They attack with a bite, or with a stinger that does the
same amount of damage with some ongoing poison damage on top (save ends) and
recharges on 3-6. Both of these count as basic attacks, allowing the
pseudodragon to use the stinger when it performs a Flyby Attack. This, as usual,
lets them fly their speed without drawing opportunity attacks and make a basic
attack at any point.</p>

<p>They also have the ability to turn invisible when they stand still. This is a
standard action that recharges whenever the critter is damaged, which makes it
useful both for lying in ambush or for escaping an ambush gone wrong.</p>

<p>The MV pseudodragon has the same level, role, HP and speed, but trades Flyby
Attack for a less powerful effect on its bite that allows it to fly 4 squares
without worrying about opportunity attacks. The stinger remains a basic attack
but is also a bit more restricted, as it can only be used on a target that can’t
see the pseudodragon. To make up for this, its Invisibility power now allows it
to move, and only ends when the pseudodragon makes an attack.</p>

<p>All of this adds up to a more lurkerish monster, which will charge its chosen
target with a stinger attack while invisible, then use the bite combined with
its high fly speed to get away.</p>

<h2 id="spitting-drake">Spitting Drake</h2>

<p>Spitting Drakes are Medium, and got their name from their ability to spit gobs
of acid. This is their main weapon when hunting, and they’re also easily
domesticated to serve as (somewhat messy) guard animals. In the wild, they’ll
sometimes join guard drake packs, which I think is an interesting worldbuilding
detail. They’re present in both books but their stat block is the same in both
cases.</p>

<p>These creatures are Level 3 Artillery with 38 HP, and run with speed 7. Their
bite, as standard for artillery, is kinda weak. Their acid spit is a Ranged 10
attack targetting Reflex and doing acid damage.</p>

<h2 id="rage-drake">Rage Drake</h2>

<p>When the books say larger drakes are harder to tame, they’re talking about Rage
Drakes. Our first Large drake, it also has the Mount keyword. It appears in both
the MM and the MV.</p>

<p>Rage Drakes definitly didn’t get this name because they’re gentle! Adult
specimens are outright impossible to tame, but a trainer that starts with a
hatchling can make it into a combat mount better than any warhorse.</p>

<p>Wild rage drakes are highly territorial hunters. Like other drakes, they’re also
social creatures who gather in clutches. In fact, a solitary rage drake will
sometimes invite itself into a clutch or guard drakes or other smaller species
and become its leader. So yes, it’s possible for your PC party to run into a
single drake clutch composed of rage, spitting and guard drakes, all wild and
all hungry.</p>

<p>Rage drakes are Level 5 Brutes with 77 HP. They have a single basic attack in
the form of a bite, but also have a slightly weaker claw attack. Their Raking
Charge ability allows them to charge and make two claw attacks.</p>

<p>When bloodied, Rage Drakes freak out! They become immune to fear, and gain +2 to
hit and +5 to damage on all their attacks. If they’re serving as a mount, the
rider also gains a +2 to hit on all of <em>their</em> attacks.</p>

<p>The MV version is largely identical, save for the facts that its damage math has
been fixed and the damage bonus from being enraged is only a +2. The accuracy
bonus for the drake and its rider remains the same.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The MM gives us three for the entire “Drake” entry:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 2: 2 guard drakes, 2 elf archers, 1 elf scout. A patrol and their guard
animals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 1 pseudodragon, 1 human mage, 2 human guards, and 2 human
bandits. Either a bandit squad of bandit-hunting militia, with the mage having
brought his familiar along.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 1 rage drake and a band of assorted lizardfolk protecting their swamp
home.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I really, really like this version of drakes, mainly because of the lore they
bring along. Domesticated drakes should be a common sight in any society, which
does a lot to make the world feel not only magical but also fresh. I’m actually
a bit disappointed that 5th edition seems to have gone back on this and made
them related to dragons again.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>These beasties seem to be new to Fourth Edition, at least as presented here. If
I remember correctly, the things 3.x called Drakes were related to dragons -
they had the Dragon “monster class” but weren’t technically dragons
themselves. As a GM you would use drakes when you wanted a “lite” dragon
encounter.</p>

<p>Here, the name is basically another bit of Behemoth-like medieval taxonomy
employed by the people people who live in the 4e implied setting. A drake is a
clawed, carnivorous reptile that’s not big enough to be called a Behemoth. There
are several species of drake: some walk on two legs and have limited
manipulation capability, some walk on all fours, some even fly!</p>

<p>I’ve heard that this means they correspond to the smaller varieties of dinosaur,
but I think that’s not quite true. While several of them are similar to certain
species of dinosaurs, they’re less so than behemoths (where you often can draw a
direct visual parallel between a given behemoth and the real-world counterpart).</p>

<p>Drakes in the wild are aggressive and territorial predators, more likely to
attack a group of humans than a wolf or bear. Despite this, they’re rather easy
to tame, and can be frequently encountered not only as guard or attack animals,
but as pets or even mounts!</p>

<p>In short, drakes pretty much fill the same roles as dogs. If you want to make
your particular version of the setting feel more fantastical you could even say
that it has no dogs, since the sapients here never domesticated wolves. It’s all
drakes all the time.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault kinda backs down from this idea a bit, saying that drakes are
more aggressive and “alien” than corresponding domesticated mammals and such
tend to be feared by common people, though they are often encountered in the
service of hostile humanoids. Personally, I would disregard this bit completely
and keep them as a common dog-substitute for all sapient peoples.</p>

<p>Both books agree that the larger varieties of drake are harder to domesticate,
which would mean good old warhorses are still more common than rage drakes.</p>

<p>All Drakes are Natural Beasts with the Reptile keyword. Between the Monster
Manual and the Monster Vault there are quite a few of them, so we’ll split this
single entry into multiple posts. This is part 1.</p>

<h2 id="spiretop-drake">Spiretop Drake</h2>

<p>Present only in the MM, this Small drake is a Level 1 Skirmisher with 29 HP. It
waddles at Speed 4 but flies with speed 8 and hover capability. They’re a social
species that likes to nest in high places, which means clutches of the things
nest in towers and spires in large cities and swoop down to steal shiny things
from unwary passerby.</p>

<p>Unusually, it has two basic attacks: a bite with its toothed beak that works as
usual, and a claw attack that targets Reflex. The claw attack does a measly 1
damage, but a hit also allows the drake to steal a small object from the target,
like a single coin, vial or scroll. The fact that the snatching claw is a basic
attack is important, because it means the drake can use it as part of a Flyby
Attack, where it flies 8 squares while immune to opportunity attacks and
performs a basic attack at any point along the movement.</p>

<p>So yeah, having your small, shiny, plot-critical McGuffin stolen by a pack of
spiretop drakes is a hazard in urban adventures. Ideally they’d nest atop a
crumbling abandoned tower filled with enough bad stuff to count as a dungeon. As
a level 1 monster it’s not really affected by the math bug, so you can use it
as-is.</p>

<h2 id="guard-drake">Guard Drake</h2>

<p>In the wild guard drakes are pack hunters, but they got this name because
they’re very commonly used as guard animals, since it’s very easy to train them
for this role. Basically, if someone in the real world would use rottweilers for
a job, they’ll use guard drakes in D&amp;D. Yes, even as pets.</p>

<p>This Small drake has nearly identical stat blocks in both books. It’s a Level 2
Brute with 48 HP and a single bite attack that does extra damage if the drake is
within two squares of an ally. This makes then pair well with any melee monster.</p>

<p>The only difference between the MM and MV versions is that the MM version is
<em>immune to fear</em>, which is an interesting detail. I’m inclined to keep it, since
it’s flavorful and unlikely to make a PC completely ineffective even at this
level.</p>

<h2 id="needlefang-drake-swarm">Needlefang Drake Swarm</h2>

<p>From what I hear people saying on the Internet, needlefang drake swarms have
been responsible for more PC deaths than most other monsters in this
edition. Let’s see why.</p>

<p>Needlefang drakes are cat-sized bipedal lizards, though I guess they’re more
like angry chihahuas in temperament. A single individual is not really
dangerous, and I imagine some people might want to keep one as a pet. In the
wild, they gather in large packs that can take down much larger prey and “strip
it to the bone in seconds” according to the book, which also implies some people
keep whole swarms of them as “living traps”. Beware needlefang drake hoarders!</p>

<p>A swarm of needlefang drakes is Medium in size and counts as a Level 2 Soldier
with 38 HP and the Swarm keyword. Like all swarms it takes half damage from
melee and ranged attacks, and extra damage from close and area attacks. It’s
immune to fear, and has a Swarm Attack aura 1 that allows it to make a free
basic attack against each enemy that begins its turn inside.</p>

<p>This swarm has two actions: a Swarm of Teeth as a basic attack, which deals
extra damage against prone targets; and Pull Down, which targets Fortitude and
does no damage, but knocks the target prone on a hit.</p>

<p>So why are needlefang drake swarms so dang deadly? Well, as MM1 soldiers, their
accuracy is 2 points higher than it should be (something which would be fixed by
the new monster math). So a swarm has no reason to ever spend its standard
action on anything but Pull Down, which will hit even tough fighters very
reliably and set them up for an increased-damage free attack from the aura
which will hit even <em>more</em> reliably due to combat advantage.</p>

<p>To make things worse, if you have multiple swarms in play they can position
themselves so that anyone they knock down is subject to aura attacks from <em>all</em>
of them. That amount of damage per round can take a level 1-2 PC down to 0 quite
fast. And to top it off, there’s no in-setting reason for needlefang drakes to
follow the sort of combat etiquette that prevents them from attacking downed
PCs, so they can potentially keep making free attacks until those PCs hit their
death threshold.</p>

<p>These tiny terrors are just the thing to spruce up a kobold lair or the hideout
of a sadistic villain, but don’t overuse them. Or at least make sure your wizard
knows Thunderwave before using more than one swarm at a time.</p>

<p>Years ago, Alexa’s father (a minor baron) sent her to the capital to serve as
squire to a somewhat eccentric knight. She returns to her home a knight in her
own right, skilled with sword and spell, to find her ancestral lands at the edge
of ruin. Against the wishes of her ailing father, Alexa sets forth to bring
honor, glory, and wealth back to her family name.</p>

<p>Alexa is made using the spell-based <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/20/characters-mystic-knight.html">Mystic Knight template from this blog</a>,
rather than the Imbuement-based official one. Her Weirdness Magnet is a perfect

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I’ve been looking at some old D&amp;D modules lately and wondering how to convert
them to Dungeon Fantasy. One of the things that gave me some trouble was
movement.</p>

<p>Dungeon movement in AD&amp;D is by default extremely methodical and done with an
almost paranoid level of caution<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. This is why even an entirely unencumbered
party moves only 120ft/40m over ten minutes. They’re moving reeal slow; they’re
trying to maintain stealth; they’re looking for traps and secret passages;
someone is mapping. You move five times faster if you don’t have to map, and ten
times faster if you throw caution to the wind and tromp through the dungeon at
combat speed.</p>

<p>This is important because AD&amp;D wants you to track turns precisely and roll for
wandering monsters every so often. As a delver, you ideally want to get in, get
the treasure, and get out as soon as possible. Every extra turn you spend in
there has a chance of bringing in hostile enemies who don’t have any loot.</p>

<p>Dungeon Fantasy (either version) expects the party to move cautiously but
doesn’t have specific or timing rules for it<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. So, when you convert AD&amp;D
modules to Dungeon Fantasy, how do you handle movement?</p>

<p>The easy solution is to just glom the AD&amp;D turn and movement rules into Dungeon
Fantasy! The resulting amalgamented abomination is actually rather
playable. Check it out:</p>

<h2 id="dungeon-fantasy-movement">Dungeon Fantasy Movement</h2>

<p>Time spent inside a dungeon is measured in ten-minute <em>turns</em>, like in ye olde
days. When exploring a dungeon, delvers are by default assumed to be moving very
cautiously and methodically, keeping their marching order. When moving this way,
they cover a distance per turn equal to ten times the Move of the slowest party
member, measured in yards or meters. For example, a party containing a heavily
armored knight with Move 3 would explore 30 yards/meters in a turn<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Moving this way is slow, and costs the party 1 FP per 5 turns of movement, but
has several benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The party is assumed to be on the lookout for danger. They roll to detect
traps, enemies and other hazards automatically without having to state they
are doing so.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, they can make Stealth rolls to avoid detection by monsters. If
they’re walking together, this is a group Stealth roll as detailed in Exploits
p. 6. All the usual factors for stealth are still at play here, such as light
sources and so on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the pace that allows the PCs to map the dungeon as per Exploits p. 18.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Actively investigating a room for treasure and secret doors also takes a turn
and requires the normal rolls for these procedures. Turns spent searching do
count for tracking FP cost.</p>

<p>The FP cost makes ye olde routine of delving for 5 turns and resting for one an
efficient way to proceed, though the delvers can elect to push forward and take
the FP loss if they’re pressed for time. The party can elect to move at five
times this pace and still retain the first two benefits above, which makes
traversing already-mapped portions of the dungeon a lot faster.</p>

<p>These rules are perfect for playing in converted old-school modules. You can use
the modules’ own rules for random encounters with them, though obviously you’ll
still want to convert the monsters. It’s probably okay to ignore these rules in
modules made specifically for the DFRPG, since they tend to assume a faster
pace.</p>
