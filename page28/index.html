<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure I saw these in a 3e supplement somewhere, but there’s a nifty
bonus stat block here that ties them to the Nentir Vale.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Cadaver Collectors are specialized constructs first built by ancient
necromancers to provide them with a supply of corpses. Their metal-plated bodies
are covered in long spikes that they use to impale collected corpses for
transport and delivery. They were commonly sent to “clear” battlefields after a
battle had ended.</p>

<p>Like many other constructs they’re pretty good at performing the job they were
designed for and at following instructions related to it, but they can’t do
anything else well. This is why no one sent them to fight in those battles. They
only follow the orders of their current master, or those of a person who also
serves that master.</p>

<p>The original recipe for cadaver collectors was repeatedly lost and rediscovered
over the ages. No one in the Nentir Vale knows how to build one in our narrative
present, but there are several old ones still around in the wild. Many of them
are located somewhere within the Witchlight Fens, a swampy region in the
south-central Vale.</p>

<p>When a collector’s master dies it will usually fulfill the last order it was
given and then stand by waiting for more. If someone happens to die in their
assigned area in the meantime, they will dutifully go out to collect the
bodies. If someone manages to convince the collector they work for the
collector’s master, the creature will obey their orders.</p>

<p>After enough time waiting for orders that never come, their programming might
mutate a bit, giving them a bit more initiative. Some collectors decide to go
looking for a new master to serve. Others decide to broaden their mission
parameters and consider living creatures valid targets for collection.</p>

<p>There’s a hobgoblin necromancer named Gokof living in the Witchlight Fens who is
unusually skilled at convincing ancient cadaver collectors to work for him. He’s
nominally a member of the Daggerburg goblin tribe but spends most of his time
away from them and in the company of his collectors and undead servants. He
rarely has more than two collectors working for him at any one time, but never
seems to have trouble finding more to replace them.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>We get two stat blocks here, one for a cadaver collector and one for Gokof.</p>

<h3 id="cadaver-collector">Cadaver Collector</h3>

<p>These constructs are Large Natural Animates and Level 9 Elite Soldiers with 200
HP and a speed of 8. They’re immune to charm, disease, and poison, and have
Resist Lightning 10. They are somewhat weak to thunder damage: whenever they
take thunder damage, they become slowed (save ends).</p>

<p>Collectors attack with <strong>Slams</strong> that deal physical damage and grab on a hit
(escape DC 20). They can grab one Large creature or up to four Small creatures
at once. As an elite it can perform <strong>Double Slams</strong>.</p>

<p>The collector can also spend its action to <strong>Impale</strong> a grabbed creature. This
deals massive damage, pulls them into the collector’s space, restrains them, and
inflicts 10 ongoing damage (save ends all). When the collector moves, the
creature is pulled along, and when the effect ends, the creature reappears in an
adjacent space.</p>

<p>You might have noticed that there’s a limit to how many creatures a collector
can <em>grab</em>, but not to how many it can <em>impale</em>. It’s not going to matter much
in practice, because it’s highly unlikely a collector will impale the whole
party at once. However, if it ever becomes relevant I’m inclined to say their
impaling limit is the same as the one for grabs. A fully loaded collector would
have four Medium cadavers impaled and another four grabbed. And would probably
have more than the two arms depicted in the illustration.</p>

<p>Finally, the collector can <strong>Trample</strong> once per encounter like the big chungus
it is. The rules are as usual: it moves its speed and can cross enemy spaces
while doing so, making an attack that deals heavy physical damage and knocks
prone against every enemy whose space they cross.</p>

<p>Collectors fight by pretty much applying their programming to the PCs. Grab
impale, repeat. When fully loaded, trample to retreat.</p>

<h3 id="gokof-hobgoblin-necromancer">Gokof, Hobgoblin Necromancer</h3>

<p>Gokof is a Level 9 Controller (Leader). He has speed 6 and low-light vision from
being a hobgoblin. He wields a <strong>Staff</strong> as both weapon and implement, and has
an array of necromantic spells at his disposal.</p>

<p>His basic ranged attack is a <strong>Necrotic Ray</strong> that deals necrotic damage on a
hit and slows for a turn as an effect. Anything that happens “as an effect”
always happens, regardless of whether the attack hits or not! Less often
(recharge 5+) he can cast <strong>Sapping Tendrils</strong> as a ranged area attack. This is
not selective, and on a hit it deals necrotic damage, immobilizes, and inflicts
ongoing necrotic damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Instead of casting a spell, Gokof can use <strong>Command Animate</strong> to order an
animate ally to make a melee basic attack as a free action. Cadaver collectors
are animates, of course, and so are a lot of undead.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, when an enemy within 5 squares of Gokof regains HP, the
necromancer can use <strong>Dark Healing</strong> to automatically deal them a chunk of
necrotic damage and recover 24 HP himself.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>If you think about it, the existence of cadaver collectors shows that necromancy
in D&amp;D requires an ideological commitment to the spread of undeath. These
constructs are more powerful and have a less ethically questionable nature than
most “servant” undead. They also take more skill to build, but their original
builders clearly <em>had</em> that skill. And yet chose to task their constructs with
collecting corpses for turning into zombies.</p>

<p>I like the addition of Gokof to this entry. It helps establish a concrete
situation where cadaver collectors appear in the Nentir Vale. It’s also an
example of how a less “ideological” necromancer would come to control these
creatures. This is more than even most other setting-specific monster books
do. Those usually just say “these monsters exist in this setting”.</p>

<p>Boggles have been in the game since 1st Edition, when they appeared on the
Monster Manual II. This is their 4e debut.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Boggles are mischievous humanoid fey. They’ve been around a very long time, and
are actually the common ancestors to both banderhobbs and mundane goblins! They
love playing cruel pranks on others, and move from the Feywild to the world
every time they find a fey crossing. The world’s mortals are so much more easily
fooled than the jaded fey of their home plane!</p>

<p>These creatures are naturally sneaky and have some capacity to bend space. It’s
common for a child to complain to their parents about a “bogeyman” who keeps
lurking just out of sight and disappears when looked at. Parents dismiss that as
a childhood fantasy right up until the boggle strikes. Common pranks include
spoiling milk, tying shoelaces together, setting clothes on fire, and all the
stuff you might have read in old real-world myths about the Fair Folk. At the
most cruel end that does include switching infants for swaddled animals or just
plain snatching children away. There are also some adventurer-specific pranks
like disassembling armor and hiding the pieces, or swapping brand new or magic
weapons for old and rusty replacements.</p>

<p>For all their cruelty, boggles are cowards, preferring to do their spying and
sabotage through those mini-portals they can create. They get nervous and
anxious when near other people, and this causes them to sweat profusely. Boggle
sweat is a very distinctive substance, viscous and slippery like grease. It’s
resistant to fire, though. Traces of it are often confirmation that boggles are
acting in a location.</p>

<p>Sometimes, stronger or smarter creatures manage to coerce boggles into working
for them. Left to their own devices, they associate only with each other.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Boggles are an early-Heroic threat suitable for introducing PCs to the more
fairy-tale side of fey opposition. They’re Small Fey Humanoids with ground and
climb speeds of 6, and darkvision. They also have Fire Resistance 5 from their
weird sweat.</p>

<p>Their signature traits are <strong>Dimensional Window</strong>, which allows them to make
“remote” Thievery checks against creatures up to 10 squares away; and
<strong>Dimension Hop</strong>, a move action that lets them teleport up to 3 squares. Even
tough they’re small, boggles have a long melee reach, because they hit you
through a tiny portal. All of their individual powers are also based around this
ability to create small dimensional windows.</p>

<h3 id="boggle-sight-stealer">Boggle Sight Stealer</h3>

<p>This is a Level 3 Lurker with 37 HP. Its basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>claw</strong>, and
its favorite move is the <strong>Peek-a-Boo Trick</strong> a Range 10 attack that targets
Reflex. It does no damage, but it lets the boggle pull the target to a space
within 2 squares of it and to grab them. The target is blinded until the grab
ends, either by the target beating its escape DC of 13, or by the boggle being
more than 2 squares away from the target.</p>

<p>While the boggle is grabbing a victim, it can use a <strong>Neck Bite</strong> on them. This
attacks Reflex and deals heavy physical damage, half on a miss. If the victim
escapes the grab, the boggle can attack it with <strong>Face Rip</strong> as a reaction,
automatically dealing a bit of physical damage and allowing the boggle to
teleport 3 squares.</p>

<p>Sight Stealers work very well against controllers and ranged strikers,
particularly if they have buddies that can keep the other PCs away from them.</p>

<h3 id="boggle-blink-trickster">Boggle Blink Trickster</h3>

<p>Blink Tricksters are Level 4 Artillery with 43 HP. They’re the only artillery
monster I’ve seen that lacks a ranged attack! Instead, their basic <strong>claw</strong> has
a, well, boggling Reach of <em>10</em>, and enjoys the increased accuracy usually given
to ranged attacks from artillery monsters. This is an interesting implementation
because it means they’re not actually weak in melee and need not fear
opportunity attacks as much.</p>

<p>In addition to the standard traits discussed above, blink tricksters can use a
<strong>Double Diversion Trick</strong> to attack twice in one action. This recharges when
they’re first bloodied. And if they’re damaged by a melee attack, they can
dimension hop as a reaction once per encounter.</p>

<h3 id="boggle-chase-trickster">Boggle Chase Trickster</h3>

<p>Chase tricksters are Level 4 Skirmishers with 53 HP. Their <strong>claws</strong> have a more
typical reach of 2, and they have a couple of interesting movement powers.</p>

<p><strong>Foot-Snare Trick</strong> is a minor action that can target an enemy flanked by the
boggle. It has an automatic effect: if the target moves more than 3 squares on
their next turn, they end that movement prone. This won’t do much good against
defenders, but it can ruin the plans of mobile strikers.</p>

<p><strong>Chase Trick</strong> is a reaction that triggers when the boggle is missed by a melee
attack. It can shift up to 3 squares and pull the attacker along with it. This
represents the creature tricking the attacker into chasing them, so the pull
does provoke opportunity attacks! If the attacker ends this movement without
taking damage, they can make a free attack against the boggle. The power
recharges when the boggle is first bloodied. It’s only worth using if the boggle
has plenty of other buddles hanging out nearby.</p>

<h3 id="boggle-body-snatcher">Boggle Body Snatcher</h3>

<p>This is a Level 5 Controller with 61 HP. It has all standard boggle traits
including a Reach 2 <strong>claw</strong> attack. Its special move is <strong>Body Snatch</strong>
(recharge 4+). It’s a non-damaging attacks that dominates on a hit (save ends)!
Until the target saves against this, the boggle is removed from play, and the
target gains a +2 bonus to hit and damage. When the effect ends the boggle
returns to play within 5 squares of the target.</p>

<p>In other words, this thing works exactly like a Jockey from Left 4 Dead 2,
riding the victim and directing their movement. It’s also extra-sweaty: once per
round as a minor action it can leave a <strong>Boggle Sweat Stain</strong> on the
ground. Each stain occupies a square and lasts until the end of the
encounter. Whenever a non-boggle enters a sweat-stained square, they
automatically fall prone.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like these creatures! Their lore gives them a proper fairy-tale monster feel,
and their mechanics are flavorful and interesting. My favorite is the Reach 10
melee attack from the blink trickster, with the body snatcher’s sweat stains
a close second.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if these are from a specific adventure or if they’re original. This
is the first time I saw them. They are mostly generic monsters, but there’s a
couple of Vale-specific hooks here.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Bloodfire oozes are created by evil rituals which mix the blood of sacrificial
victims with the blood of demons. The resulting creatures emit dangerous levels
of heat and like most oozes are always on the hunt for more organic material to
digest. They are able to recognize and avoid attacking their creator, and if fed
regularly are tame enough to be used as guards. They’re usually placed near
stone and metal traps or paired with other creatures that have a high resistance
to fire.</p>

<p>Bloodfire uses are rumored to prowl the Temple of the Yellow Skull in the
Ogrefist Hills area, and some of them were also found by dwarven miners under
Nenlast in the Old Hills. The latter were stored inside a giant iron statue of a
demon, and spilled out when the miners began dismantling it.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Bloodfire Oozes are Large Elemental Beasts with the Ooze keyword, and level 7
elite brutes with 196 HP. They project a <strong>Bloodfire Aura</strong> (2) that deals 10
fire damage to any creature caught inside, and their <strong>Demonic Fire</strong> fire makes
all of their fire damage ignore the first 10 points of fire resistance possessed
by the target. As oozes, they suffer none of the usual penalties for squeezing
through tiny spaces. They are immune to fire and vulnerable 10 to cold.</p>

<p>The oozes attacks are the traditional <strong>slam</strong> (this time dealing fire damage) and
a <strong>Fiery Eruption</strong> (recharge 5+) that attacks all creatures in a Close Blast 3
to deal light fire damage and ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).</p>

<p>The ooze can also form faces on its surface, usually the faces of the victims
sacrificed to make it. These spew a <strong>Sulphuric Breath</strong> as a minor action once
per round, attacking all creatures in a Close Blast 3 and dealing poison damage.</p>

<p>When the ooze is first bloodied, it immediately recharges Fiery Eruption and
uses it as a reaction.</p>

<p>Many of the monsters we saw through our readings have selective auras and area
attacks. The bloodfire ooze does not, which limits the selection of allied
monsters. Unless you want lots of, er, friendly fire to happen in your encounter
you need something with more than 10 fire resistance, and immunity is
preferred. As mentioned above, the most likely encounter is a pair of oozes plus
a hazard or two in the battlefield.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>One more ooze type. They’re thematic for infernal or abyssal cults, and might be
a nice surprise to spring on players who load up on acid resistance when they
hear the word “ooze”.</p>

<p>For added fun, you should run with the demon statue idea and stick a pair of
these things inside that one statue from the 1e PHB cover, making them jump out
as soon as the PCs pry out its gemstone yes.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>The Blackfang gnolls first appeared as one of the antagonist groups in the
Thunderspire Labyrinth adventure. Here we get stats for Blackfang-specific
variants which combined with the MV could allow you to run that adventure with
updated stats.</p>

<h2 id="region-the-old-hills">Region: The Old Hills</h2>

<p>The Old Hills take up part of the central and northeast regions of the Vale, and
have this name because they were the first area settled by the Nerathi. Its main
“points of light” are the dwarf hold of Hammerfast at its center and the human
settlement of Nenlast way up in the northeast corner. The Fiveleague House inn
near Hammerfast is a popular rest stop for travelers.</p>

<p>Also in this area is Thunderspire, a tall isolated mountain whose peaks are
eternally shrouded in storms. It contains the entrance to a vast series of
underground ruins that used to belong to the ancient minotaur empire of Saruun
Khel. Go through that portal and a little ways into the underground, and you’ll
find the Seven-Pillared Hall, a community run by the Mages of Saruun, a cabal
who’s interested in profiting from trade between the people of the surface and
the Underdark. They enforce diplomatic neutrality within the Hall, but there’s
enough intrigue and backstabbing down here that it doesn’t <em>quite</em> count as a
“point of light”.</p>

<p>The Hall is described in detail in the <strong>Thunderspire Labyrinth</strong>
adventure. This book assumes it hasn’t happened yet.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The Blackfang are a tribe of Yeenoghu-worshipping gnolls who live in the Old
Hills area of the Vale. They get this name from their distinctive fangs, which
are black and much longer than what is typical for gnolls. They frequently
attack travelers going through the area, with the aim of capturing people to
enslave and/or eat.</p>

<p>Even Hammerfast fears them, because it’s already lost too many warriors trying
to hunt them down. The Blackfang lair in complex tunnel warrens under the Old
Hills and avoid traveling overland whenever they can, preferring to use the
ancient tunnels of Saruun Khel to move about and to only emerge just before they
strike.</p>

<p>Recently, Blackfang expeditions into the Saruun Khel ruins uncovered an ancient
temple known as the Well of Demons. The Well was dedicated to Baphomet, but the
Blackfang chieftain Maldrick Scarmaker locked himself inside in order to
rededicate it to Yeennoghu. While he’s in there, the Blackfang are effectively
leaderless and much less organized. However, it seems Scarmaker is close to
finishing his task, as the Well has started spitting forth demonic spirits that
possess certain members of the Blackfang. They call this the Butcher’s Blessing,
and it basically makes them into demons, giving them mutations like wings and
barbed tails. These “blessed” gnolls now seek to consume the souls of their
victims, and not just their flesh.</p>

<p>Stopping the depredations of the Blackfang could be a good hook for the
Thunderspire Labyrinth adventure, which is itself quite sandboxy.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The Blackfang are gnolls, so they’re Medium Natural Humanoids and their
signature ability is <strong>Pack Attack</strong>, giving them a +5 damage bonus against
targets adjacent to two or more of their allies. We see several group-specific
stat blocks below, and they combine well with the more generic gnoll stats
presented in other books.</p>

<h3 id="blackfang-feaster">Blackfang Feaster</h3>

<p>This one bites, and it doesn’t brush its teeth. Feasters are Level 6 Brutes with
89 HP and Speed 7. Their basic attack is a <strong>Ravening Bite</strong> that deals poison
damage and slows (save ends). Against bloodied creatures they can skip straight
to the <strong>Devour</strong> part, dealing heavy physical damage and knocking prone on a
hit.</p>

<p>Simple but effective, particularly if you take Pack Attack into account.</p>

<h3 id="blackfang-gravedigger">Blackfang Gravedigger</h3>

<p>Gravediggers illustrate the Blackfang preference for underground travel and
tactics. They’re Level 5 Lurkers with 48 HP. Their ground speed is 6 with Earth
Walk, and they have a burrow speed of 2.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong>, which they can use as part of a <strong>Snatch From
Below</strong> maneuver. To use this, they must be burrowing and have no creature
grabbed. It lets them burst up from the ground and make a bite attack ignoring
cover and concealment. On a hit, they grab the target (escape DC 15),
restraining it and inflicting 5 ongoing damage until the grab ends.</p>

<p>They pair well with enemies that can keep the other PCs’ attention elsewhere
while they gnaw on a squishy victim.</p>

<h3 id="blackfang-howler">Blackfang Howler</h3>

<p>Howlers fight with whips and can imbue their howls with a bit of fear
magic. They’re Level 7 Skirmishers with 77 HP and speed 7. Instead of moving
normally, they can choose to <strong>Skulk</strong>, shifting up to 4 squares. This makes
them hard to pin down.</p>

<p>The <strong>Whip</strong> is reach 2 and can be used in a <strong>Whip Trip</strong> maneuver, which deals
a bit less damage than a basic attack and knocks the target prone. Their <strong>Howl
of Dread</strong> is a minor action that attacks a Close Burst 3 and immobilizes on a
hit. It recharges when they are first bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="blackfang-render">Blackfang Render</h3>

<p>Renders specialize in fighting with their claws. They’re Level 8 Soldiers with
87 HP and Speed 7. Their <strong>Claws</strong> damage and mark for a turn on a hit. They can
also use their <strong>Feral Grasp</strong> to deal light physical damage and grab a target
(escape DC 16). Once they have grabbed someone, they can use <strong>Blinding Fury</strong>
on the victim as a minor action, an attack dealing light physical damage and
blinding (save ends) on a hit.</p>

<p>They have no specific abilities to punish someone who ignores the mark, so the
default -2 attack penalty against other targets is the only deterrent there.</p>

<h3 id="blackfang-hyena-pack">Blackfang Hyena Pack</h3>

<p>A pack of hyenas! This is a Large Swarm made up of Medium creatures. It’s a
Level 6 Brute with 85 HP. It has all the swarm traits: resistant to melee and
ranged attacks, vulnerable to close and area attacks, can occupy other’s spaces
and counts as difficult terrain for them, can squeeze into any opening wide
enough for a single Medium creature.</p>

<p>The pack’s <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura (1) deals 5 damage to enemies caught inside, or
10 if there are at least two allies adjacent to the enemy. Their basic attack is
a <strong>Bite</strong> that damages and immobilizes (save ends). The condition also ends if
the pack is no longer adjacent to the target.</p>

<p>The leader of the Blackfang, fully enjoying the Butcher’s Blessing. PCs will
likely fight him inside the Well of Demons. If the GM decides to advance time
and say he succeeded in rededicating the temple, he could also be found at the
head of a raiding party alongside his honor guard. The book also suggests using
this stat block for his replacement if the group has already run through
Thunderspire Labyrinth, but personally I’m not a fan of keeping the status quo
the same in this way.</p>

<p>Anyway, Maldrick as presented here is Level 8 Elite Artillery with 148 HP. He’s
more or less equivalent to a warlock, and though his powers have familiar names
they’re all demonic in origin. He wields a <strong>mace</strong> as a weapon and a <strong>rod</strong> as
an implement. The mace can make decent basic attacks, but like any warlock
Maldrick will probably want to stay back and spam <strong>Eldritch Blast</strong>. He can
also cast <strong>Dire Radiance</strong> to deal radiant damage and prevent enemies from
closing (they take 10 extra radiant damage if they move closer to him in their
next turn).</p>

<p>Once per encounter he can cast an <strong>Infernal Moon Curse</strong> at one or two
creatures, dealing heavy poison damage and keeping them immobilized 5 feet off
the ground for a turn. On a miss, this still deals half damage.</p>

<p>Like a PC warlock, Maldrick can use a minor action to place a <strong>Curse</strong> on an
enemy, making all of this implement attacks deal 1d6 extra damage against it for
a turn. This stacks with Pack Attack, obviously. If an enemy enters a square
adjacent to him, he can use his <strong>Spined Tail</strong> to make an opportunity attack
against them.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>My final impression is the usual: a sarcastic “yay, more gnolls”. They are very
useful if you intend to run Thunderspire Labyrinth with updated rules.</p>

<p>If you have already run that adventure, these stats can still work to represent
Blackfang remnants, or gnolls from other tribes when combined with the more
generic stat blocks. I’d probably say that after Maldrick’s death at the hands
of the PCs, the remaining Blackfangs splinter into several mutually hostile
bands led by “blessed” gnolls who used to be his lieutenants.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This our first example of a “concrete” dragon, where they take the generic
information from the Monster Manuals and use it to make a specific atypical
individual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, a young white dragon came to the Nentir Vale. Making her lair
inside the nothern Winterbole forest, she frequently flew out to hunt and to
break things for fun, and eventually came to see the Vale as her own personal
buffet and playground.</p>

<p>This lasted until the Tigerclaw barbarians who also lived in Winterbole decided
to stand up to her. Their chief was the great hero Fangstrike, who dueled the
dragon and manage to bury his war pick in her left eye. Wounded and humiliated,
the dragon flew away and spent the next thirty years sulking.</p>

<p>The experience made her a cautious and vindictive. About nine months after
Fangstrike died of old age, she came back to wreak havoc on the tribe, killing
the chief’s surviving family and threatening the rest of the tribe with
destruction unless they paid her an annual tribute of treasure and a high-status
hostage. This how she came to be known by her current name of Bitterstrike.</p>

<p>Bitterstrike made the same ultimatum to every other group of sapients who made
Winterbole their home: the Frost Witches, the Winterbole Treants, and the satyrs
who made the evergreen forest their home. Pay tribute and send hostages, or die.</p>

<p>These days, Bitterstrike considers herself queen of Winterbole, and those annual
hostages make up her court. She uses them as agents and servants, and has them
keep an ear out for rumors and news from their original communities. If any of
these news sounds like an insult or threat to her, Bitterstrike becomes obsessed
with taking revenge on the offender.</p>

<p>Usually this takes the form of a direct strike by the dragon, but Bitterstrike
is cautious enough to gather a posse of her vassals if she feels a solo attack
doesn’t have good odds. Whether alone or at the head of a posse, Bitterstrike
takes great pleasure in revenge and in the acquisition of more loot.</p>

<p>However, the dragon queen is nowhere near the genius she thinks she is, and her
“vassals” view her more as a pawn than as a queen. Every single faction under
her control manipulates her into advancing their own goals by telling her false
information, and the Satyrs are in the habit of replacing the magic items in her
hoard with cheap mundane copies.</p>

<p>PCs can come into conflict with Bitterstrike by trespassing into her hunting
grounds or offending her directly. It might also happen that they piss off one
of her “vassal” factions and they plant a few convenient rumors to sic her on
the party. Depending on how powerful the party is, she might bring in a few
elite vassals along for support.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We have stats for Bitterstrike herself and for the typical vassals or pets that
might accompany her. A lot of these are based on other existing factions we’ll
look at later, so you get a preview of what they can do right here.</p>

<p>All of the vassals have Resist Cold 5 and Ice Walk, both necessary for survival
when hanging around Bitterstrike. All vassals and the dragon herself also have a
custom encounter power named <strong>Bitter Vengeance</strong>, which triggers when an enemy
within 5 squares hits them with an attack. As a free action, they deal 10
automatic cold damage to the enemy and push them 2 squares. Bitterstrike’s
vengeance is more forceful and yeets the offender 7 squares instead. This makes
them all perfect to fight on maps that include hazardous cold-based terrain like
bodies of icy water or snow-covered pits.</p>

<h3 id="bitterstrike">Bitterstrike</h3>

<p>The White Wyrm of Winterbole is a Level 10 Solo Brute with 520 HP, Resist Cold
10, a ground speed of 6 with Ice Walk, and a flight speed of 6. She’s actually
the first MM3/MV-compatible adult white dragon we ran across in our readings, as
the MV only contained Young and Elder examples. Though she only has one eye,
that doesn’t affect her stats.</p>

<p>As a white dragon, she has an <strong>Action Recovery</strong> trait that automatically ends
any dazing, stunning, or dominating effects on her when her turn ends, and
<strong>Instinctive Rampage</strong> that gives her a free action at her initiative + 10
where she can move her speed, go through enemy spaces, and use a claw attack on
any enemy whose space she moves through. She gains Resist 5 to all damage during
this action, to better tank opportunity attacks. She also has a <strong>Savage Blood</strong>
trait that makes her crit on a roll of 17-20 while bloodied.</p>

<p>Bitterstrike’s Reach 2 <strong>bite</strong> deals cold damage, half on a miss. Her Reach 2
<strong>claws</strong> can attack two different creatures with one action. Her <strong>Breath
Weapon</strong> (recharge 5+) is a Close Blast 5 that deals cold damage and slows (save
ends). On a miss it deals half damage and slows for a turn.</p>

<p>If a flanking enemy hits Bitterstrike she can react with a <strong>Tail Slap</strong> to
damage and push them 5 squares. The first time she’s bloodied, <strong>Bloodied
Breath</strong> allows her to recharge and immediately use her breath weapon.</p>

<p>Bitterstrike has Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 10. Every single one of her vassals listed
below has higher mental stats than her.</p>

<h3 id="treant-vassal">Treant Vassal</h3>

<p>A Winterbole treant, patterned after a coniferous tree, serving as one of
Bitterstrike’s vassals. It’s a Large Fey Magical Beast (plant) and a Level 8
Elite Soldier with 182 HP and a speed of 8 with Forest and Ice walk. It has
Threatening Reach 2, and a <strong>Wooden Body</strong> trait that makes it take ongoing 5
fire damage (save ends) whenever it takes fire damage.</p>

<p>The treant’s basic attack is a <strong>Slam</strong> and it can <strong>Double Attack</strong>. It can
also use a <strong>Bitterwind Blast</strong> that’s like a smaller version of Bitterstrike’s
breath weapon. It recharges when the creature is first bloodied.</p>

<p>As an Essentials-style soldier, the Treant doesn’t mess with marks and can
instead use <strong>Pounding Branches</strong> to attack any enemy in reach that makes an
attack that doesn’t target it.</p>

<h3 id="satyr-vassal">Satyr Vassal</h3>

<p>This satyr is a Medium Fey Humanoid and Level 8 Elite Artillery with 136
HP and a speed of 6 with Ice Walk. As a bard-type, it’s surrounded by an aura
(5) of <strong>Cold Wind Song</strong> that gives it +5 to defenses against attacks
originating from <em>outside</em> the aura.</p>

<p>The satyr wants to stay really far away from its enemies, so it uses a Range 20
<strong>North Wind Bow</strong> to attack. A hit deals cold damage and pushes the target 3
squares. Once per encounter it can pull a Hanzo and fire a <strong>Diving Dragon
Shot</strong> that hits an Area Burst 2 within 20 squares. This deals cold damage, half
on a miss, and creates a zone that deals cold damage to any who end their turn
inside until the end of the encounter. If forced into melee, it can use its
horns to <strong>Gore</strong>, damaging the target and knocking it prone, which should allow
for a quick escape to safer ranges.</p>

<h3 id="tigerclaw-vassal">Tigerclaw Vassal</h3>

<p>This barbarian from the Tigerclaw tribe is a shifter who’s pretty much always in
“shifted” mode. He’s a Level 8 Elite Skirmisher with 178 HP and Speed 6. His
<strong>Charging Pounce</strong> trait gives him a 1d6 damage bonus on charge attacks and
allows him to use its normal actions after charging. Usually a character can
only use free actions after charging on their turn.</p>

<p>The barbarian fights with a <strong>Light Pick</strong> and can use it to make <strong>Double
Attacks</strong>. Once per encounter he can make a special attack named
<strong>Bitterstrike’s Slash</strong> which deals heavy cold damage and ongoing cold damage
(save ends) on a hit. On a miss it slows and still inflicts the ongoing damage
(save ends). If an enemy ends their move flanking the vassal, he can use <strong>Wild
Instinct</strong> to shift 1 square or move its speed.</p>

<h3 id="frost-witch-vassal">Frost Witch Vassal</h3>

<p>This elf sent by the Frost Witches is the smartest vassal in the bunch. She’s a
Level 10 Elite Controller with 204 HP and Speed 6. She emits a <strong>Chill Aura</strong>
(1) that slows enemies caught inside.</p>

<p>The witch fights in melee with a <strong>Frost Touch</strong> that deals cold damage and
slides 2 squares, and at range with an <strong>Icicle Shard</strong> that deals cold damage
and immobilizes for a turn.</p>

<p>Her big finisher is a <strong>Hailstone Hex</strong> that deals cold and psychic damage. It
also forces the target to grant combat advantage and inflicts ongoing cold
damage (save ends both). While this effect persists, enemies of the witch that
start their turn adjacent to the victim suffer 5 cold damage. In other words,
it’s a miniature hailstone cloud following the victim around!  This recharges
when the witch is bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="wild-coldscale-drake">Wild Coldscale Drake</h3>

<p>This is more of a pet than a vassal, as it’s a Medium Natural Beast and not
sapient. You can use these to fill out a vassal encounter. It’s a Level 8 Lurker
with 70 HP and Speed 8.</p>

<p>Coldscale drakes have <strong>Snow Camouflage</strong> that gives them partial concealment in
any icy terrain, and deal an extra 4d6 damage to any target that cannot see
them.</p>

<p>They need that boost because their <strong>bite</strong> is a little weak without
it. Fortunately they can use their <strong>Snow Stalker</strong> ability when on icy terrain
or within 10 squares of a white dragon to become invisible until after they make
their next attack.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Bitterstrike is a dangerous solo boss fight for a level 6 or 7 party. When
facing more powerful PCs she will bring enough elite vassals and coldscale
drakes to keep that level advantage. Most encounters against her should happen
in the Winterbole region, which will give her and her vassals a big terrain
advantage. Anyone level 5 or lower is seriously risking their lives by going too
deep into the Winterbole forest.</p>

<p>Lore-wise, I like the dynamic of a somewhat stupid “queen” constantly
manipulated by her much smarter vassals.</p>
