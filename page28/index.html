<p>Will-O’-Wisps in D&amp;D are inspired by folklore, and their legend is in turn
inspired by the natural phenomena that make swamp gas glow at night. I think
they’ve been in the game since AD&amp;D, though their exact lore might have changed
a bit over the years.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Will-o’-wisps are cruel fey spirits who feed on the fear and despair of other
sapients. They like to hang out in swamps and marshes, whose natural mists and
swamp lights provide them with hiding places. Their bodies are orbs of gauzy
material, and they glow with an otherwordly light that has the power to lure
unwary victims. It can also burn their flesh and drain their spirit.</p>

<p>Their tactics are pretty much iconic - lure victims to an isolated place full of
hindering terrain and kill them in a way that produces maximum horror.</p>

<p>These creatures can communicate in Elven, and when they speak they have that
cool effect where they brighten and dim in compass with their speech. They can
also douse their light for better stealth, but this also prevents them from
using it as a weapon.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Will-o’-Wisps are Small Fey Magical Beasts, and Level 10 Lurkers with 57
HP. They count as Insubstantial, taking only half damage from non-force
attacks. They have low-light vision and a flight speed of 6 with Hover, and an
altitude limit of 2 squares.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, wisps can turn their light on or off using the <strong>Fey Light</strong>
ability (minor action 1/round). A darkened wisp has concealment and can make
Stealth checks to become hidden, but it cannot attack. If a wisp is missed by an
attack, it can <strong>Blink Out</strong> as a reaction. When this happens, the wisp darkens
and teleports 5 squares. I guess it can make that Stealth check as part of this
action too.</p>

<p>The wisp’s attacks are all light-based. The most classic one is of course
<strong>Luring Glow</strong>. This is a Close Burst 20 that targets one non-blinded creature,
which is another way to say it’s a ranged attack that doesn’t draw opportunity
attacks. It targets Will, does no damage, pulls the victim 3 squares, and dazes
it (save ends).</p>

<p>Once the victim is in range and vulnerable, the wisp is going to hit it with its
basic <strong>Glimmer Wisp</strong> attack, which is Reach 2, targets Reflex, and does
radiant damage. Once per encounter it can also use <strong>Spirit Drain</strong> on a
bloodied target. This is a Reach 3 attack that targets Fortitude, deals psychic
damage, weakens (save ends) and heals the wisp for 14 HP.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Wisps are lurkers and have a couple of good stealth powers, but they don’t
seem to have a lot of ability to take advantage of this stealth. Their best
power is the very controller-y Luring Glow. When building wisp fights, you
should pair them with other opportunistic monsters that can bring the hurt to
those dazed characters.</p>

<p>Our sample encounter is level 9: two wisps and a quartet of spriggans (two
powries, 2 thorns). Evil fairies all around.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<p>Warforged were originally introduced with the Eberron setting in 3e, as a
playable option. They made their 4e debut in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/02/07/warforged.html">first Monster Manual</a>,
which a couple of “monster” stat blocks for warforged and some abbreviated rules
for using them as PCs.</p>

<p>Full support for playable warforged in 4e would arrive with the Eberron Player’s
Guide, published in June 2009. However, just before that happened we’d get a few
more NPC stat blocks here in the MM2, which was published in May 2009.</p>

<p>The basic lore for warforged remains the same as in <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/02/07/warforged.html">the Monster Manual</a>. The
Eberron-specific info would only appear on the Eberron Player’s Guide, but I
guess the two books were developed in parallel because the extra stat blocks we
get here seem like a particularly good fit for that setting.</p>

<p>Their signature traits remain the same: the Living Construct keyword, a +2 to
saves against ongoing damage and the <strong>Warforged Resolve</strong> encounter power (see
the link above to read about what this does).</p>

<h2 id="warforged-resounder">Warforged Resounder</h2>

<p>These are warforged spellcasters whose power derives from a retained echo of the
ringing sound of their creation forges. Their spells tend to have themes of
sound and impact, dealing a mix of thunder and force damage. They wear robes and
wield staffs, so I guess they’re meant to come across as “arcane”, but you could
easily use their lore for a more priestly type since it’s so close to that of
the Anvilpriest (below).</p>

<p>Resounders are Level 6 Artillery with 57 HP and the common traits described
above. Their <strong>quarterstaves</strong> are weak melee attacks, so they prefer to stay
away and cast <strong>thunder orbs</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) that do good thunder
damage and push 2 squares.</p>

<p>They also have a couple of encounter spells: <strong>Resounding Sphere</strong> is an area
version of Thunder Orb that knocks prone instead of pushing, making it a good
fight opener; and <strong>Rumble Staff</strong> is a “keep-away” melee power that does
thunder damage, pushes 1 square, and knocks prone.</p>

<p>Their final encounter spell is the amusing <strong>Collision Bolt</strong>, a ranged attack
that targets two enemies and slams them together. It works by dealing force
damage to both targets, and sliding the second one 3 squares towards the
first. If the slide ends with both targets adjacent to each other, they’re both
knocked prone.</p>

<h2 id="warforged-savage">Warforged Savage</h2>

<p>With an unfortunate name and a somewhat unfortunate illustration, this is a
warforged who feels emotions more intensely than most of its kin, and channels
all of that extra intensity into anger. It was likely produced in a forge
belonging to the Lord of Blades, since the Cannith smiths tend to go for
cool-headed discipline instead. It’s a Level 7 Brute with 98 HP.</p>

<p>This warforged has the <strong>Battlefield Tactics</strong> trait that was common in the MM1
entries, gaining a +1 to melee attacks when an ally is adjacent to their
target. It also gains 4 temporary HP whenever it hits with an attack.</p>

<p>The warforged savage uses a <strong>scimitar</strong> to fight. This is a High-Crit weapon,
and when it hits it deals a bit of automatic damage to another enemy adjacent to
its target. It can use the weapon to attack in a Close Burst 1 (recharge 5+),
and to perform a <strong>Wild Charge</strong> that deals heavy damage, and gives it a +3 AC
bonus during the movement part of the charge. This recharges whenever the
warforged hits two or more enemies with the burst attack. All of these maneuvers
benefit from the scimitar’s High-Crit property.</p>

<h2 id="warforged-anvilpriest">Warforged Anvilpriest</h2>

<p>Like the resounder, this spellcaster retains a bit of the power of its creation
forge and uses that as a source of magic. The main difference is that the
anvilpriest focuses on the searing heat of forge-fire. Despite the name, many
anvilpriests aren’t all that religious. Some are real clerics, though, and a
small number of them actually worship the creation forges themselves. I guess
the latter are mostly found amid the Lord of Blades’ forces.</p>

<p>Anvilpriests are Level 8 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 89 HP. They
wield a <strong>fiery warhammer</strong> that does bonus fire damage and inflicts a -2 AC
penalty for a turn. They can use that to perform a <strong>Heat of Battle</strong> maneuver
(recharge 4+), which is like a basic attack but replaces the AC penalty with
ongoing fire damage.</p>

<p>In addition to this they have two encounter spells.</p>

<p>The first is <strong>Blunted Mind</strong>, an area burst that targets Will and inflicts
psychic damage. It also inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks and a -4 penalty to
damage on a hit - the first save improves this to a -2 damage penalty, and only
the second removes it entirely. This only targets enemies, so it’s safe to cast
into a messy melee.</p>

<p>The other is <strong>Mending Flash Fire</strong>, a close burst that deals fire damage to all
enemies inside (vs. Reflex) and gives both the caster and any allies in the
burst 5 temporary HP. If those allies are Warforged, they can also use their
Warforged Resolve power as an immediate reaction to this power.</p>

<h2 id="warforged-titan">Warforged Titan</h2>

<figure class="center">

</figure>

<p>Titans were some of the earliest models of warforged developed by Cannith
engineers. They’re as big and as powerful as their name implies, but they’re
also only barely sapient. In a battle, they fulfill the same role as tanks or
siege engines, but they need to be accompanied by smarter infantry or at least
by a minder who can direct them. They’re loyal to whoever holds or displays a
symbol of the titan’s creator, regardless of whom it may be or how long it’s
been since their creation.</p>

<p>Warforged Titans are Huge Natural Humanoids with the Living Construct
Keyword. They’re also Level 19 Elite Soldiers with 362 HP, which makes them
plausible counters to Slaughterstone Constructs and other near-epic giant
monsters.</p>

<p>These towering creatures fight with their built-in weapons. Their basic attack
is a Reach 3 <strong>Axe</strong> with the same “splash damage” effect as the Savage’
scimitar above, and that also marks on a hit. As a minor action they can also
use a Reach 3 <strong>Hammer</strong> that does more or less the same damage, slides the
target 2 squares, and knocks it prone. It does a bit of damage even on a miss,
likely from the shockwave. Both of these weapons enjoy the benefits of
<strong>Threatening Reach</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, the titan’s <strong>Unstoppable Charger</strong> trait makes it so a charge attack
<em>doesn’t</em> end its turn. It can perform any actions it still has after charging,
such as using a Move to shift or reposition, or a Minor action to perform a
hammer follow-up.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Warforged are people. You can find them fighting for any cause people tend to
fight for. Good, evil, or just plain selfish. They’re relatively recent
creations in Eberron, but other settings might have then as ancient
survivors/relics of a fallen empire. Titans work well as McGuffins in that role,
since they’ll obey anyone who displays the mark of their creator.</p>

<p>We have two sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: A resounder, an anvilpriest, and 3 savages. Lord of Blades patrol?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 19: A cambion hellfire magus, a steel predator, and a warforged
titan. Someone found themselves a few control amulets.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<p>That’s the actual title of the entry, so we have another case of Old School
Titling here. Dangerous plants have been a part of the game since its
beginnings, and I bet a lot of the individual monsters collected in this entry
appeared before in some form or another.</p>

<p>Lore-wise, there isn’t much on these other than “they exist”. They don’t have
strange magical origins like some of the other plant creatures we saw before,
they’re just ambulatory carnivorous plants with enough strength and mobility to
hunt people. D&amp;D worlds are already filled with impossibly lethal predators, so
it’s not such a stretch to say some of those are plants.</p>

<p>All of the monsters in this entry are Beasts, which in rules terms means they
behave like “animals” rather than like people. They also have the Plant keyword
(obviously). Their Int score is 2, so their behaviors are all
instinctive. Everything else varies per stat block.</p>

<h2 id="ambush-vine">Ambush Vine</h2>

<p>The apex predator of the plant kingdom, ambush vines can hunt anywhere: on the
surface, underground, and even in water. Wherever they are, they’re always
hunting, and using the tasty nutrients of their victims to fuel their explosive
growth rate. Ambush vines can form blights so vast they threaten civilization,
and its rumored that this contributed to the fall of the old eladrin empire of
Cendriane.</p>

<p>As their name implies, ambush vines are a lot more cunning than your average
plant. They can burrow just under the surface or blend into the surrounding
normal vegetation to wait for victims, and then launch surprise attacks against
them.</p>

<p>Ambush Vines are Large Fey plants, and Level 16 Elite Controllers with 308
HP. They have tremorsense 20, and nothing in their stat block says they’re blind
so I guess they can see as well even without eyes. Their speed is 6 in almost
any mode of movement other than flight. They can move over the ground with
Forest Walk, climb, burrow and swim.</p>

<p>A vine’s most basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Poison Lash</strong> that targets Reflex,
deals physical damage, and inflicts ongoing poison damage. It can also attack
with <strong>Lashing Vines</strong> in a Close Burst 4 pattern, which does more damage than
the basic attack. It’s also super-effective against immobilized targets, dealing
extra damage and healing the vine for 5 HP. As a minor action, the vine can use
a Reach 4 <strong>Foot Snare</strong> to deal the same damage as the basic attack and knock a
target prone.</p>

<p>Though ambush vines deal extra damage to immobilized foes, they can’t do the
immobilizing themselves, so they must be paired with other monsters capable of
it. Fortunately, they can make their own!</p>

<p>When the vine is first bloodied, it undergoes <strong>Rapid Growth</strong> as an emergency
response, producing two Ambush Vine Shoot minions (see below). It can also make
a minion voluntarily using <strong>Sprout Vine</strong>, a minor action which costs 10 of its
own HP and produces a single minion.</p>

<h2 id="ambush-vine-shoot">Ambush Vine Shoot</h2>

<p>This is the juvenile form of the ambush vine. It’s a Medium Fey plant, and a
Level 15 Minion Controller. Their senses are the same as those of an adult
specimen, though their only special movement mode is burrowing.</p>

<p>These minions have a single attack, <strong>Wrapping Vines</strong>, which deals minion-tier
damage and restrains (save ends). “Restrained” is one step worse than
“immobilized”: it roots the victim in place and inflicts a -2 penalty to
attacks. A restrained target also counts as immobilized, so the shoot’s “parent”
vine can deal extra damage against them.</p>

<p>The shoot also has a passive trait named <strong>Enwrap</strong>, which affects adjacent
enemies and inflicts a -2 penalty to their saves against being immobilized or
restrained.</p>

<h2 id="bloodthorn-vine">Bloodthorn Vine</h2>

<p>This is a vine with pale leaves and one single large thorn. It feeds by impaling
victims on that thorn, which is hollow and capable of draining blood. As it does
so, the vine’s leaves take on a reddish coloration.</p>

<p>Bloodthorn vines are Medium Natural plants, and Level 2 Soldiers with 41 HP. By
the logic I’ve been using, them being low-level means they might occur near the
archetypical Starting Village. This means they’re one more threat common
civilians must be wary of in their daily lives, along with stirges, anhkegs, and
giant ants. Bloodthorns are much less lively than Ambush Vines, having only a
ground speed of 5 with Forest Walk and no special movement modes. They have
Blindsight 10 but again are not blind themselves.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Striking Vine</strong> with no riders on its physical
damage. The real danger here is the <strong>Impaling Thorn</strong>, which does the same
damage and grabs the target. The vine can sustain the grab with a standard
action to deal heavy automatic damage to the victim and heal 5 HP. It can use
<strong>Pulling Vines</strong> as a minor action to shift 1 square and pull a grabbed victim
along with it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the bloodthorn vine can only impale a single victim at a
time… but you <em>can</em> have multiple bloodtorn vines on the same encounter group.</p>

<h2 id="greenvise-vine">Greenvise Vine</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-vine-greenvise.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So named because “Piranha Plant” is already taken. This is a Large Natural
plant, and a Level 7 Soldier with 83 HP. Its speed is only 4, so it relies on
grabbing targets to prevent them from running away.</p>

<p>The greenvise’s basic attack is a <strong>Striking Vine</strong>, and they can also use an
<strong>Ensnaring Vine</strong> vs. Reflex to do the same damage and grab the target. That’s
when the big chomper comes into play: <strong>Vise Bite</strong> targets a grabbed victim’s
Fortitude, deals a bit of initial damage, restrains, and inflicts ongoing
physical damage. A save ends both the restrained condition and the ongoing
damage <em>but does not end the grab</em>. You have to escape from that using the
default rules.</p>

<p>The Greenvise also has the same Pulling Vines trait as the Bloodthorn.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I actually have an easier time distinguishing between killer plants when I see
them all together than when I see them in separate entries over multiple books.</p>

<p>We have three encounters here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 2: 3 bloodthorn vines and 3 stirges. Probably competing to see who can
drain the party dry first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 9: 2 greenvise vines, 1 spectral panther, 3 quickling runners. The
quicklings and the panther can be used to herd the party towards the
slow-moving plants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 1 ambush vine, 1 lingerer fell incanter, 1 lingerer fell
knight. Sinister vestiges of lost Cendriane.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A new group, and a surprise lesson on Nerath’s history!</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>So far we’ve only got the bare minimum of information on the history and
geography of Nerath as a whole. We mostly know that the Vale was part of its
northern frontier, that it did a number on the Vale’s native peoples when it
moved in, and that it fell about a hundred years ago. This entry gives lots of
new information because the history of the Phantom Brigade is intimately tied to
that of the empire of Nerath.</p>

<p>The Empire of Nerath was founded in the distant south around six hundred years
ago, with the establishment its capital city of Nera. It quickly spread in all
directions and became a world power. Its long history starts with an early
period of rapid expansion, goes through the troubled and despotic rule of
Emperor Magroth, and then through a long period of hegemonic peace and
stability. This peace lasted until the empire’s abrupt fall about 100 years ago.</p>

<p>No one knows exactly how the fall of Nerath happened (or, if they do, they’re
keeping it a secret). What is known is that a combination of traumatic events
that might have included both monster attacks and natural disasters left the
entire imperial family unaccounted for. Nerath’s armies were left leaderless and
without direction, and all the simmering conflicts between its noble houses blew
up with no one to keep them in line. Soon the complex infrastructure that united
all regions of the empire stopped being maintained and crumbled, turning its
cities and provinces into the scattered points of light we know today.</p>

<p>Nerath had several knightly orders at the time of its fall, and none where more
prestigious than the Knights of the Empire. Imperial Knights were paladins and
rangers selected for their skill, loyalty, and nobility of character. They
answered directly to the Emperor, acting as his personal bodyguards and
extensions of his will. When everything went to ruin, they were one of the few
groups who remained committed to defending the empire and keeping it
whole. Nearly all of them died in the decade between the initial catastrophe and
the day everyone finally acknowledged Nerath was no more.</p>

<p>This did not stop the Knights, however. The oaths that bound them to the order
were more than just pretty words. They included a mysterious magical effect or
curse that eventually made the dead Knights return as ghosts. This started
happening decades after the fall. Though the Knights know their empire has
fallen, they are still compelled to seek the honor they could not gain in life,
and fulfill their oaths as best they can. They are now known as the Phantom
Brigade.</p>

<p>The first recorded appearance of the ghost knights was right here on the Vale,
when three of them were spotted racing through the Gardbury Downs. In our
narrative present they can be seen anywhere the hand of Nera used to reach.</p>

<p>Knights look much as they did in life, though ghostly and translucent. This
means you have a very important decision to make. Is the Nazgul-looking fellow
in the illustration a typical Knight, or is he Sir Georg Edgelord, who is an
outlier and should not be counted? Your answer will say very interesting things
about Nerath either way.</p>

<p>Their weapons bear the emblem of the Threefold Crown of Nerath, unmistakably
marking their bearers as Knights of the Empire. Those weapons and also serve as
the receptacle for their souls.</p>

<p>Though we saw in previous entries that Nerath did some pretty horrible shit in
the past, the Knights seem genuinely concerned about upholding its highest
ideals and their original oaths, even though they’re ghosts. They will not
attack random travelers unprovoked and will probably be enthusiastic allies
in the fight against threats to the Vale if they can be convinced of the need
for this alliance.</p>

<p>However, they can still come into conflict with the PCs if they try to trespass
upon the areas the Knights still protect (which are full of juicy
treasure-filled Nerathi ruins). In these cases a fight might be avoided if the
PCs can present the Knights with a genuine writ of passage or Nerathi signet
ring.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Phantom Brigade members are Medium Shadow Humanoids with the Undead tag. Most of
them are former humans. They have Darkvision and immunity to disease and poison,
but lack the usual resistances and vulnerabilities. They have ground speeds of
6.</p>

<p>As ghosts, our knights have both Insubstantial and Phasing. Only force damage
will deal full damage to them, and since they don’t have additional
vulnerabilities the trait can’t be temporarily shut down. They do tend to have
less HP than a typical monster of their level, which somewhat compensates for
it.</p>

<p>Their unique signature trait is <strong>Unrelenting Brigade</strong>. Whenever an ally who
also has this trait drops to 0 HP within 5 squares of the knight, they gain a +2
to-hit bonus until the end of their next turn.</p>

<p>Every single stat block in this entry has Lawful Good as its Alignment, a rarity
in monster and NPC stat blocks.</p>

<p>Level-wise, the Phantom Brigade can be a threat from the mid-Heroic to the mid
Paragon-tier, putting them on the same bracket as, say, the Gray Company.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-brigade-squire">Phantom Brigade Squire</h3>

<p>Squires are Level 6 Minion Soldiers. They can attack with their <strong>Soulbound
Short Swords</strong> and their <strong>Spectral Crossbows</strong>, both of which deal psychic
damage. If an enemy hits an ally adjacent to the squire with a melee attack,
they can use <strong>Shielding Martyr</strong> to become the target of that attack instead.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-brigade-armiger">Phantom Brigade Armiger</h3>

<p>Armigers are Level 7 Brutes with 71 HP. They fight with <strong>Soulbound Bardiches</strong>
that deal psychic damage, and their charges use the <strong>Charging Rebuke</strong> special
attack that deals the same amount of damage, push the target 1 square, and knock
it prone. They can also make <strong>Furious Sweeps</strong> to attack everyone in a Close
Blast 2 for slightly less damage.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-brigade-justiciar">Phantom Brigade Justiciar</h3>

<p>These Level 7 Skirmishers have 54 HP and project an aura (1) of <strong>Blind
Justice</strong> that inflicts a -2 to-hit penalty on enemies caught inside. They fight
with <strong>Soulbound Hammers</strong> that can be used in melee or thrown, and they can
<strong>Evade and Strike</strong> at will. This ends any marks on them, lets them shift 4
squares, and then make a basic melee attack.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-brigade-banneret">Phantom Brigade Banneret</h3>

<p>Bannerets are likely minor officers, since their name means “one who carries a
banner”. They’re Level 8 Soldiers with the Leader tag and 60 HP. Their phantom
banner projects a <strong>Gift of Grace</strong> aura (3) that grants a +5 bonus to saves to
allies inside.</p>

<p>The banneret fights with a <strong>Soulbound Tulwar</strong>, which does psychic and radiant
damage. As an effect, it also marks and slows the target for a turn. If a marked
enemy within 5 squares tries to make an attack that doesn’t target the banneret,
they can use <strong>Stalwart Restraint</strong> as a reaction. This always hits! It
immobilizes the target and inflicts 10 ongoing psychic damage on them (save ends</p>

<p>Bannerets are quite danregous. Their attacks always do something and they’re a
lot more dangerous to ignore than your typical soldier monster.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-brigade-templar">Phantom Brigade Templar</h3>

<p>These imposing undead paladins bring the Brigade into the paragon tier. They’re
Level 12 Controllers with 85 HP. They fight with <strong>Soulbound Morningstars</strong> that
deal psychic damage and slide 2 squares on a hit. They can attack at range with
<strong>Righteous Strikes</strong> that deal cold and radiant damage, and also slow on a hit
(save ends). And they can use their <strong>Frightful Majesty</strong> to attack enemies in
a Close Burst 1 and daze them for a turn on a hit. This recharges when they’re
first bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="phantom-brigade-knight-commander">Phantom Brigade Knight-Commander</h3>

<p>Knight-Commanders are high-ranking officers, likely responsible for leading all
Imperial Knights in a given region. They’re Level 14 Soldiers with the Leader
tag and 96 HP.</p>

<p>Their weapon of choice is a <strong>Keening Soulbound Backsword</strong>, which deals psychic
and thunder damage and which marks the target for a turn as an effect. The sword
can be used in a <strong>Soul Strike</strong> maneuver (recharge 5+) that deals more damage
and gives the knight-commander 10 temporary HP. The commander can also attack
enemies in a Close Burst 1 by repeating the <strong>Oath of Nerath</strong>, which targets
Fortitude and deals psychic damage.</p>

<p>If an enemy within 2 squares that’s marked by the commander chooses to ignore
the mark, the commander can use <strong>Call to Arms</strong> to allow an ally within 5
squares to shift 3 spaces and make a free basic attack against the triggering
enemy.</p>

<p>If my assumption back in the first paragraph is correct, there’s a
Knight-Commander in the Vale. The book doesn’t give any information about that
individual, so you’re free to come up with their backstory and description
yourself.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Turns out undead in 4e don’t <em>have</em> to be evil! The magic binding these knights
to the world could still be quite bad, but it has not affected their souls or
personalities. Still, as mentioned, they might end up fighting PCs who insist on
exploring former Nerathi sites the knights consider to be under their
protection.</p>

<p>I’m very interested in what might happen if the Gray Company or one of their
Nerathi revivalist rivals runs into the Phantom Brigade. I imagine that anyone
who meets with the knights’ approval will have the legitimacy of their claims
greatly bolstered… but I also imagine that Halvath Cormarrin would <em>not</em> have
their approval. On the other hand, the Knight-Commander’s sword is likely the
weapon Cormarrin is after, because that’s an easy and fun connection to make.</p>

<p>Things will turn out very differently it Cormarrin does in fact have a way to
compel the Phantom Brigade to be loyal to him. This could be the thing that
catapults the Gray Company into a paragon-tier threat. In that case, making the
Knights turn against him would be a key step in defeating their imperialist
aims.</p>

<p>If you want the Phantom Brigade to be evil after all, you can use their stats
exactly as they are presented and only change their alignment and behavior. You
can also add some Death Knights to their number, since they are also evil undead
knights with their souls bound to their weapons. You might say those are members
of the order who managed to retain their physical bodies after all this time.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<p>In a situation that has been common in this reading, we’re in a halfway place
when it comes to trolls. The Monster Manual marks their debut in this edition,
and the Monster Vault gives us a final selection of updated stat blocks. Here in
the Monster Manual 2, published between those two books, we have a selection of
trolls that expands the options from the MM, but is not yet updated for the MV’s
math.</p>

<h2 id="ice-troll">Ice Troll</h2>

<p>It’s unclear from the text whether ice trolls are a variant troll species or
just a variant culture. They inhabit the Frostfell, one of the world’s coldest
regions, but occasionally make their way to slightly warmer climates. Ice trolls
have a more complex and technically advanced culture than that of “typical”
trolls. They know how to make weapons, and prefer to use them in combat instead
of their claws. They also emanate a cold aura.</p>

<p>If you want to portray your trolls less universally hostile, ice troll
communities could make good trading partners in cold regions, trading their
weapons and crafts for other products they need. Ice troll mercenaries might
also be found among the forces of anyone who sets up shop in the frozen regions
of your campaign world.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Ice trolls are Large Natural Humanoids and Level 10 Soldiers with 109 HP. Their
<strong>Emanating Cold</strong> aura (1) slows any enemies caught inside for a turn. They
have a ground speed of 8.</p>

<p>Ice troll regeneration works exactly like that of standard trolls: Regeneration
10 plus Troll Healing that allows them to keep regaining HP after
hitting 0. Both are shut down for a turn if the troll takes acid or fire damage.</p>

<p>This troll wears scale armor and fights with a <strong>maul</strong>. If their maul attack
bloodies an enemy, <strong>Frenzied Strike</strong> allows them to make another free
attack. This <em>could</em> lead to a big chain combo if the ice troll manages to hit
several near-bloodied PCs, but most likely you’ll be looking at one extra attack
when this triggers.</p>

<p>Weapon use would make ice trolls a lot more dangerous than standard ones in a
“realistic” system like GURPS, but here it’s mostly for color since damage is
entirely level-based. It does allow you to place magic weapons and armor as
treasure by saying the troll was using them.</p>

<h2 id="bladerager-troll">Bladerager Troll</h2>

<p>This troll was updated for the Monster Vault, so we already saw its numbers on
the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/01/09/troll.html">MM/MV reading</a>. A new bit of lore in this entry says that some of the
weapons and armor implanted on a bladerager are magic, which gives GMs an excuse
to place magic items as treasure in bladerager encounters. This makes them the
only monster in the game to have literal loot drops.</p>

<h2 id="troll-vinespeaker">Troll Vinespeaker</h2>

<p>Here’s something you don’t see every day: a troll spellcaster with genius-level
intellect! You go, vinespeaker! Break those stereotypes! Unfortunately the
vinespeaker doesn’t break <em>every</em> troll stereotype, so it’s still Chaotic
Evil. You’ll have to break that one yourself if your campaign calls for it.</p>

<p>Vinespeakers use a style of primal nature magic that involves wrapping
themselves in thorny vines and letting their blood soak the plants to gain
control over them. This would be lethal for any other practitioner, but for a
troll it’s no trouble at all. With their magic power and high intelligence,
vinespeakers tend to become leaders or revered advisors of larger troll
communities.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Vinespeakers are Level 14 Controllers with 142 HP. They have Regeneration 10,
Troll Healing, and the usual vulnerabilities, as well as the usual Speed 8.</p>

<p>They can use their <strong>claws</strong> to fight like a typical troll, but their vines give
them many more options. They have a ranged attack named <strong>Ray of Thorns</strong> that
deals physical damage, and an area burst attack named <strong>Thorny Burst</strong> that
deals light physical damage and immobilizes (save ends). This also creates a
zone of thorny difficult terrain that deals damage to those caught inside, and
lasts until the end of the encounter. If any of these attacks bloodies a target,
the vinespeaker gets to make a free claw attack. No target is specified, so any
PC within reach will do fine.</p>

<p>Note: Thorny Burst is at-will. Vinespeakers can turn the entire battlefield into
a spiky mess in no time at all. A good tactic for the is to spam this attack
until there’s no more ground to cover or until the PCs are all immobilized, then
target the most vulnerable foes with the single-target Ray.</p>

<p>Finally, they have an encounter ability named <strong>Chant of Power</strong>, which gives
allies in within 5 squares 10 temporary HP and a +4 damage bonus while the
temporary HP lasts. This works wonderfully as either a fight opener or a
mid-fight boost.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like these MM2 trolls, they do a good job of subverting the troll stereotype.</p>

<p>We get three encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 2 ice trolls, 2 worgs, and 1 manticore. Lots of raw melee power in
this one, with a maneuverable skirmisher thrown in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: 3 bladeragers, 1 duergar blasphemer, 1 duergar hellcaller. Duergar
diabolists are exactly the sort of person who’d make bladerager trolls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 4 war trolls, 1 destrachan far voice, 1 vinespeaker. The war trolls
can more or less ignore the thorns. They’ll be slowed by the difficult
terrain, but so will everyone else. The destrachan offers some artillery
support and can stay far away from the thorn zones.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
