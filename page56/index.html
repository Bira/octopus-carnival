          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> follows a pretty traditional split for
its magic. Wizards can do almost everything, but healing and other related magic
are the sole province of clerics, who in turn get their spells from the
gods. Druids also have their own “turf” staked out, receiving their powers from
the might of Nature. This, of course, means that in your typical Dungeon Fantasy
setting the gods are real and Nature as a whole is itself a sort of deity.</p>

<p>That’s not a problem for groups who want to play in the game’s implied setting,
or in an established setting that follows the same conventions. On the contrary,
it makes playing in those worlds very straightforward!</p>

<p>However, not all settings follow these conventions. One popular example is
Thedas, the setting of the <em>Dragon Age</em> games. Another is the world of <em>Dragon’s
Dogma</em>, which I have been covering <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">in some detail</a> on this blog. Though
faith and religion are prominent themes in these worlds, priests don’t gain any
supernatural powers from their deities. In fact, the very existence of the gods
is a matter of, well, faith. All magic is wizardly in nature, even spells that
deal with healing or with plants and animals.</p>

<p>Even some D&amp;D settings take a similar approach. Eberron still restricts access
to healing magic to “divine” characters, but their powers come from specialized
training rather than being granted through prayer. Does the training put clerics
in direct contact with their gods, or is it just a specialized form of wizardry?
Once again, it’s a matter of faith.</p>

<p>And then there’s <em>Final Fantasy</em>, a series that does its own thing by having
very present “god-like” entities in each of its games yet stating that the magic
traditionally associated with clerics is wielded by especially trained wizards
that don’t necessarily have any relation to those entities.</p>

<p>GMs who want to use <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> to run a campaign in one of those
settings, or in a home-brewed setting following similar themes, need to do a bit
of work. I’ve included several suggestions on how to do it below.</p>

<h2 id="first-step-clerics-are-wizards">First Step: Clerics are Wizards</h2>

<p>In an “agnostic” <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> setting, all magic is wizardly! Neither
type of Power Investiture exists. Druids and clerics rely on Magery instead. In
effect, they are wizards who underwent somewhat different training.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The “set” advantages in the Cleric template become Clerical Investment {5} and
Magery 3 {35}, leaving 40 discretionary points for advantages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The “set” advantages in the Druid template become Green Thumb 1 {5} and Magery
3 {35}, leaving 35 discretionary points for advantages.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This step is the same no matter what other decisions you make for the campaign.</p>

<h2 id="second-step-spells">Second Step: Spells</h2>

<p>Since everyone is a wizard, everyone draws from the same spell list! This list
should include all the spells that were previously forbidden to wizards, since
that particular kind of niche protection is now unnecessary. All former clerical
and druidic spells rely on mana, and are affected by the same countermeasures as
wizardly spells.</p>

<p>If you’re using the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> boxed set, this presents a bit of a
problem. Wizardly spells have complex prerequisite chains, while the others have
no requirements beyond a certain level of Power Investiture. How to effectively
combine the two? Here are some alternatives:</p>

<h3 id="the-simple-option">The Simple Option</h3>

<p>If you’re trying to learn a spell from the Cleric or Druid lists that isn’t also
on the Wizard list, look up its required level of Power Investiture, and read
that as the required level of Magery for the spell. That is its only
prerequisite! If the spell in question <em>is</em> on the Wizard list, you <em>must</em> use
its standard wizardly prerequisites.</p>

<p>This is a good option for settings like that of <em>Dragon Age</em> or <em>Dragon’s
Dogma</em>, where healing or nature magic is something any wizard can learn.</p>

<h3 id="the-complex-option">The Complex Option</h3>

<p>Under this option, clerics and druids train in exotic styles or wizardry only
taught to members of their church or circle. Record the Cleric’s Magery as
Magery (Holy), and the Druid’s as Magery (Druidic)<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. They use their
traditional spell lists and prerequisite structure, though their spells still
count as wizardly and are affected by mana levels and magical countermeasures.</p>

<p>All three spell-casting professions also gain access to the following advantage:</p>

<h4 id="magical-style-familiarity-2-pointslevel">Magical Style Familiarity (2 points/level)</h4>

<p><strong>Prerequisite: Magery (Any) 1+</strong></p>

<p>You have learned the secrets of another magical style. Specify which one
(Wizardly, Holy, or Druidic) when you first buy this advantage. This must
obviously be different from your first style!</p>

<p>You can learn spells from your new style as if you had that style’s Magery at a
level equal to your level in this advantage. You can’t have more levels of this
advantage than you have Magery. When you learn a spell, also write down which
style it is from. Spells learned as part of one style can’t serve as
prerequisites for another!</p>

<p>The GM might ask for a story reason for you to learn this advantage, such as
joining a religious order, druidic circle, or wizard’s guild. If you already
know two styles, you can buy the advantage again to learn the third one!</p>

<p>This is a good option for settings in the vein of Eberron or Final Fantasy,
where the different types of magic are all gained through training but their
practitioners jealously guard their secrets from each other<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="the-expensive-option">The Expensive Option</h3>

<p>Use the prerequisite chains from <strong>GURPS Magic</strong>, which already organizes all of
its spells as if they were wizardly. This is the expensive option because you
would need to acquire the book if you don’t have it already, and using it <em>just</em>
for the prerequisites might be a bit wasteful. It does have a fair number of
spells that aren’t present in the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> boxed set, though those
would need some careful scrutiny before you can let them into your game.</p>

<h2 id="third-step-special-abilities">Third Step: Special Abilities</h2>

<p>Clerical and Druidic magic are more than just spells! Each includes a set of
intrinsic powers bought as advantages, known as Holy Might and Druidic
Arts. They are an important part of these templates, and vital to the Holy
Warrior, who relies entirely on Holy Might instead of spells.</p>

<p>What should we do with them? Once again, there are several options.</p>

<h3 id="the-harsh-option">The Harsh Option</h3>

<p>These abilities simply don’t exist in the setting. Magic means spells,
period. This means that those discretionary points for Druids and Clerics that
don’t go into advantages will go to spells instead, and that the Holy Warrior
template cannot be used as-is in your campaign.</p>

<p>The appropriate template to use in its place depends on what the player’s
central concept is. A warrior who is a member of a Church could be a Knight,
perhaps with Clerical Investment added in. A character who needs to combine
martial prowess with a bit of supernatural help could be a well-armed Cleric who
put a few additional points into ST and weapon skills.</p>

<p>Spell-casting characters can still spend their points on supernatural advantages
permitted to wizards, such as Wild Magic or Improved Magic Resistance.</p>

<p>This is harsh because it significantly cuts down on the number of available
character options! It most resembles the very oldest versions of D&amp;D, which
didn’t have a cleric class. Most other fantasy settings I know of feature at
least some kind of non-spell supernatural power, even if it’s just the ability
to turn undead.</p>

<h3 id="the-cool-option">The Cool Option</h3>

<p>Both Holy Might and Druidic Arts are now considered “wizardly” powers! Magery
becomes the applicable talent for them. Instead of depending on the wielder’s
virtuous conduct or on the strength of Nature, they now depend on <em>mana</em>, just
like spells.</p>

<p>This means they work normally when the mana level is normal or higher. When it’s
low, the character either gets a -5 to any rolls to use the ability, or a 50%
reduction in potency if the ability doesn’t require a roll. In a no mana zone,
they don’t work at all!</p>

<p>The flavor of each ability’s description should change to reflect their new
nature, where appropriate. For example, Holy Might abilities whose descriptions
imply divine guidance would instead be based on divination magic. Where a
specific ability has an effect that overlaps with an existing Wizard power-up,
use the Wizard version instead. This mostly means using Wild Magic
(<strong>Adventurers</strong>, p. 41) instead of Contingency Casting (<strong>Adventurers</strong>,
p. 20).</p>

<p>In a setting where any magician can learn any spell, they can also learn any of
these abilities. In settings that use the Complex option, a character can learn
the abilities for their own “style” and for any other for which they bought
Magical Style Familiarity, with the level of that advantage serving as the
talent for the power. Everyone who would have access to Contingency Casting
still has access to Wild Magic instead without having to pay extra for it.</p>

<p>Mana-based Holy Might abilities <em>don’t</em> go away if their wielder stops behaving
virtuously, which allows for stories where villains hide among the ranks of the
Church, or where the organization itself behaves terribly while claiming virtue
is on their side. These are the hallmark of “grittier” settings like that of
<em>Dragon Age</em>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>By picking one option for spells and one for abilities from the ones outlined
above you would be well on your way to having an “agnostic” Dungeon Fantasy
setting.</p>

<p>For comparison, the Dragon’s Dogma adaptation I’ve been writing on this blog
uses the Expensive option for spells because it predates the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong>
boxed set and assumes the GM will already have <strong>GURPS Magic</strong>. For magical
abilities, it takes an approach similar to the Harsh option but adds a custom
list of power-ups any magical character can learn. It would work just as well
with the Simple and Cool options instead.</p>

<p>Which options do you prefer?</p>

            <p>Say you’re a GURPS player who’s inspired to make a dashing pirate, a badass
veteran soldier with a cool eyepatch, or maybe even a cyclops knight. Then you
look up the One Eye disadvantage and notice that it gives you major penalties in
combat.</p>

<p>While this is realistic, the type of story that likely inspired you is quite
cinematic, which makes seeing those penalties a bit disappointing. One-eyed
movie and game protagonists never seem to be inconvenienced by their
disability. In fact, it’s often turned into an asset, as it makes enemies
underestimate them. Here’s a new disadvantage to emulate that.</p>

<h3 id="one-eye-cinematic--5-points">One Eye, Cinematic (-5 points)</h3>

<p>You may have only one eye, but that doesn’t even slow you down! You do not
suffer from the DX and skill penalties from the realistic version of this
advantage, and may generally behave as if you had perfect depth perception and a
full field of view. This is typical of action heroes, and naturally one-eyed
aliens or fantasy creatures.</p>

<p>This is worth points as a disadvantage because you still do have only one eye!
If that eye is crippled, you’re <em>blind</em>. You also suffer any other consequences
that might be attached ot the condition in your setting, such as social
penalties or bonuses for other people to recognize you.</p>

<p>This disadvantage is also still worth points in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong>. Its implied
setting might not attach any social penalties to the condition, but it <em>does</em>
make losing an eye something far more likely to happen than in other settings,
which puts you at an increased risk of going blind.</p>

<p>I’ll begin this review by saying I’m really not the best person to review the
<strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> (DFRPG). It’s not that dislike it: in fact,
I loved it! However, I’m really bad at reading through the text in detail and
spotting all the differences between the game and the GURPS supplements that
originated it. I know these differences exist, and I know they make the game
better, but I’ll probably only internalize them when I reference the text in
play enough times.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it seems I’m late to the party when it comes to reviewing the
<strong>DFRPG</strong>, so I can point you to lots of other reviews by other people who are
better at this than me! Just Roll 3d6 has very detailed reviews of
the <a href="http://justroll3d6.com/dfrpg-review-adventurers/">Adventurers</a> and <a href="http://justroll3d6.com/dfrpg-review-exploits/">Exploits</a> books. <a href="https://pseudoboo.blogspot.com.br/">Let’s GURPS</a> is reviewing all
the recently-released books too. And I’m sure many other reviews will pop up in
time.</p>

<p>What I’ll do in this article is something only I can do: give you my own opinion
on the game. Whether that is of any value is left as an exercise for the
reader.</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

<p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> is my favorite edition of D&amp;D. Go out
and buy it as soon as it comes out.</p>

<h2 id="wait-what">Wait, What?</h2>

<p>Technically, my favorite edition of D&amp;D is 4th, but it occupies that position
for very specific reasons. It allows me to run cool, flashy battles in the style
of turn-based tactical RPGs such as Disgaea, Fire Emblem, or Final Fantasy
Tactics. If I want a campaign that feels like that, I reach for D&amp;D 4.</p>

<p>If I don’t want to run a campaign that feels like that, my tastes get a bit
fiddlier. I will <em>play</em> D&amp;D 5th edition if no other alternative presents itself,
but it doesn’t look very exciting to GM. Earlier editions add to that an
elaborate list of varied complaints that I’m sure anyone familiar with them can
guess, and I’m not one of those enlightened souls who can forget about them for
long enough to enjoy a session.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> has a premise that’s exactly like that
of Basic D&amp;D (one of the most popular OSR darlings), married to a ruleset that
does everything most editions of D&amp;D do in a way I find better. It’s
point-based! It has a unified mechanic! It has a good skill system!
Warrior-types are <em>actually</em> better at combat than spellcasters!</p>

<p>You can of course also run flashy set-piece battles with it, and they’ll tend to
have a feel that’s closer to that of the old-school editions.</p>

<p>It takes all of that from GURPS. Its rules are a specialized version of GURPS
4th Edition, with everything that’s not relevant to dungeon-crawling fantasy
campaigns stripped out and the rest adapted to the purpose. Some parts are
simpler than in the original rules, some are not, but they’re all useful. A lot
of those things which usually lead to heated arguments between players and DMs
are given proper rules and effects here. Want to stab that ogre in the eye?
Perform some unlikely feat of parkour? Check to see if that dead monster has
valuable body parts? The system has you covered.</p>

<p><strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> gives you 11 “professional templates” that are roughly
equivalent to some of the most popular D&amp;D classes, and which can be humans or
one of a selection of 8 racial templates that includes all the usual suspects
plus the Catfolk<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>While the game focuses very heavily on dungeon-delving, it’s certainly possible
to use it for fantasy campaigns that go beyond the dungeon. It has more support
for social interaction than Basic D&amp;D does<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, and bringing in more detailed
rules from GURPS is extremely easy, if the GM thinks it’s necessary.</p>

<p>So yes, if I was planning on running a D&amp;D-ish campaign and wasn’t after the
very specific feel of D&amp;D 4 combat, I would use <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> in
preference to any other actual edition of D&amp;D. In fact, I have been doing
just that for years using the previous iteration of these rules, and will gladly
switch to the new one now that I have it in my hands.</p>

<p><strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> isn’t yet available to the public as of this writing, but
the Kickstarter backers have already begun receiving their copies. Both the
printed and PDF versions should appear on <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com">Warehouse 23</a> in October.</p>

            <p>Having <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/08/07/planet-mercenary-actual-play.html">finished our characters</a>, we gathered ‘round in the second “gap”
weekend to play through <em>The Damaxuri Deception</em>. We started one hour later than
usual, due to some uncertainty over whether I would be able to make it and due
to one other player having spent the previous night at a party. Everyone else,
including me, was able to make it at the usual time of 9 AM, so we spent that
hour finishing up our fireteams.</p>

<p>Now, the players were well-aware of their company’s financial dire straits, and
from the skills they had chosen it was clear that they expected to get into
fights early and often. So I told then this adventure started in a dangerous and
unfamiliar place fraught with tension and itchy trigger fingers… a mercenary
convention! The quotes below are freely translated from Portuguese, since that
was the language we played in.</p>

<h2 id="scene-1-merccon-713">Scene 1: MercCon 713</h2>

<p>Welcome to the 713th edition of Merc-Con! Taking place in a quaint historical
habitat above scenic Damaxuri, and partly sponsored by the city of
Mellsen-Anlied (located on the surface under the station). And if you believe
the habitat is quaint or the planet is scenic, I’ve got a bridge to sell
you. This flating hunk of junk they call a station was the only place that would
consent to hosting an event for 2000 mercenaries.</p>

<p>Into it go the officers of Skynet’s Avengers, accompanied by a small drone
projecting the unblinking red eye that is the avatar of Skynet herself<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Why
are they going to a conference when the company is in the red? Skynet paid for
it ages ago and the fee is non-refundable, so they might as well make the most
of it. And hey, someone there might be hiring!</p>

<p>The station is quite hot and stinky because its creaky life support systems
can’t keep up with the body heat and body odor of 2000 sweaty mercs and the
assorted vendors who set up shop here for the event. Fortunatly, most of the PCs
are wearing their climate-controlled suits of armor. The sole exception is poor
Orangus, whose armor is a bit too heavy (and illegal!) to be acceptable attire
for anything that’s not a firefight. He’s wearing a respirator for the smell,
but his civvies and thick fur don’t help against the heat. The player’s vivid
description of his suffering earned him the game’s first RiPP.</p>

<p>The PCs linger for a while at the booth of an Unioc named Banjo Tabberlin<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> as
they watch an O’benn customer of his try out a Phubhar Shurikannon<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> and cover
every inch of the shooting gallery’s back wall with metal stars, leaving the
paper target at the center untouched. Banjo comments that the Phubhar lot he
received today is quite above-average in quality. Only two weapons exploded so
far!</p>

<p>They talked with Banjo a bit and were interested in the capabilities of the M3
Incapacitator he showed them… but gave up on it whey they heard it cost twice
what they paid for the company APC. They ended up trading comm numbers, and went
to the food court.</p>

<p>There, Leto socialized a bit with Fulda Purrgathor, the medic of all-Ursumari
company Icewall Security. She and some of her buddies were ear-deep into large
bowls of shaved ice. Fulda was a bit insensitive in her comments that working on
any patient smaller than an ursumari was much too fiddly for her tastes, but
Leto assured her it was good practice.</p>

<p>After a while Skynet reminded the group that the keynote would start in 15
minutes. The speaker was Colonel Drake Pranger, the leader of one of the
galaxy’s top mercenary companies. Skynet paid a fortune for her officers to hear
this blowhard speak, and she didn’t want them to waste the money.</p>

<p>Before heading to the keynote the PCs decided to mingle and try to look for
contracts in the con by looking for anyone who seemed to be tied to one of the
galaxy’s major ongoing conflicts. A task at which they failed miserably due to
their lack of relevant skills. The only conflict that came to their minds was
the biggest of them all - the war between the godlike AIs of the Plenipotent
Dominion and the dark matter entities of Andromeda.</p>

<p><strong>Orangus</strong>: Hey, Cap’n, you’re an AI! Can’t you talk to the PD?</p>

<p><strong>Skynet</strong>: No. I do not wish to be assimilated.</p>

<p><strong>Orangus</strong>: Then can’t we work for the other guys?</p>

<p><strong>Skynet</strong>: No. I do not wish to destroy all baryonic life in the galaxy<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Orangus here was the recipient of the game’s first Mayhem card: “Spin
Control”. He now felt extremely driven to make the company look good, and his
efforts would result in a +1 increase in Reputation for every RiPP he had left
at the end of the session.</p>

<p>Rufus decided to appeal to a higher authority and ask Skynet if she knew of
someone who was hiring. The AI reminded him he had just acquired the contact
information of a known arms dealer. Rufus asked her to call him, and she
delegated the duty right back to him.</p>

<p>It turns out Banjo did have a hot tip for them! A big bounty was going to be
posted to the local hypernet during the keynote, so they should keep an ear out
for it. So forewarned, they moved on.</p>

<h2 id="scene-2-the-keynote-and-what-came-after">Scene 2: The Keynote, and What Came After</h2>

<p>The PCs found their seats in the improvised lecture hall. Orangus put his feet
up on a chair in the row ahead of him, only to have the tiny Esspererin seated
there take a perch on his feet instead. “Hey man, thanks for the lift!” Leto has
brought a tub of ice cream and is paying more attention to it than to the hall.</p>

<p>Rufus scans the crowd, trying to spot competing companies. He fails to recognize
any, but deduces that the huge group of Esspererin in the two rows in front of
them probably belong to the same company, as does a group of humanoids further
away wearing matching uniforms.</p>

<p>Pranger enters the stage and swaggers up to his podium like the high-level NPC
he is<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. He takes a deep breath, opens his mouth to speak… and is
interrupted by a deafening chime as every monitor in the hall, and every
handbrain in the room, flashes the alert that a very substantial bounty has been
posted for a human arms dealer named Kostavi, who has been sighted in
Mellsen-Anlied.</p>

<p>The players don’t need to roll to figure out who she is: Kostavi is quite
infamous for selling weapons to the sort of people who should never have them,
and causing lots of civilian casualties in the process. Sooner or later
something like this was bound to happen, and since the bounty is equivalent to 5
Resources, it’s just what the Avengers need to make payroll for the next few
months.</p>

<p>A lot of the keynote audience thinks the same, and <em>everyone</em> begins getting up
and rushing to their ships. At this point all players begin talking, and I begin
to employ the game’s initiative system: whoever speaks first, goes first. This
time, it’s Rufus, who engages his Supersuit’s flight mode and tries to carry Max
with him. He rolls a natural 18 on 3d6, which is a critical success.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: Pick one other PC to carry along with you.</p>

<p><strong>Rufus</strong>: I choose the bear!</p>

<p>So there he goes, carrying Max over one shoulder and Leto by the scruff of the
neck as the bear roars as loud as he can to clear a path. Orangus runs after
them, and meets his powered armor suit on the way so he can fly too.</p>

<p>With Banjo’s forewarning and their impressive die rolls, the party manages to
leave the hangar first, and is almost immediately fired upon by the Esspererin
vessel <em>Neoshka Kree</em>, crewed by an Esspee merc outfit based out of a piratical
cluster. Behind them is a crew of human piratical mercs, and behind <em>them</em> is
the huge, lumbering Icewall Security vessel <em>Advancing Ice</em>.</p>

<p>Time for some starship combat! I tell my players they’re all controlling the
actions of Skynet as she pilots the <em>Star Destroyer</em>. Their PCs are cowering in
their crash seats inside.</p>

<p>Leto’s player is very tempted to fire on the <em>Advancing Ice</em>, but gives up when
I specify how much bigger the other ship is. The group ends up engaging the
<em>Neoshka Kree</em> and firing to disable. The <em>Star Destroyer</em> takes a missile hit,
but it’s not enough to put it out of commision. The other ship is disabled, and
drifts down to the planetary surface. The PCs land on Mellsen-Anlied on their
flying APC.</p>

<h2 id="scene-3-search-and-destroy">Scene 3: Search and Destroy</h2>

<p>I ask for Perception rolls to abstract the initial search for Kostavi. They know
she’s in the city, but not exactly where. Rufus and Leto beat the TN of 15, and
both Rufus and Max draw Mayhem. Rufus gets a good card that allows him to
declare a failed roll by someone else is actually a critical success as long as
he can explain how. Max gets “Friendly Fire”.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: For your information, you can always pay a RiPP to negate a card.</p>

<p><strong>Max</strong>: Screw that, I want to see what happens!</p>

<p>So I narrate that they learn that Kostavi’s hideout is in an abandoned warehouse
in the lower levels of the city. There’s a transit elevator that should bring
them very close to it… but it’s old, rusted, and alarmingly creaky. Due to the
effect of the card, Max assures all of them the elevator is perfectly safe. As
the company engineer, he knows machines, so they all should believe him!</p>

<p>The whole party (which numbers 20 with the fireteams) walks into the
elevator. The thing’s cables snap halfway to their destination, so now every PC
must explain how they avoid taking 2d6 points of armor-ignoring damage when they
hit the bottom of the shaft<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Orangus speaks first: he wants to use his UNS I-CC powered armor to fly through
the elevator’s ceiling and hold the elevator up to slow its fall! I ask him to
make an Aerial Vehicles and an Athlethics roll. Both succeed by lots, and the
Athletics roll draws Mayhem!</p>

<p>The card is simply hilarious given the situation. Orangus is overcome with the
need to stop what he’s doing and tell a story the situation reminded him
of. Since what he’s doing is <em>saving the lives of half the company</em>, the player
wisely decides to spend a RiPP to negate this, as soon as he can stop laughing
for long enough to talk.</p>

<p><strong>Orangus</strong>: But man, was that going to be one heck of a story!</p>

<p>Shaken but mostly intact, the party heads to the warehouse where Kostavi is
hiding. Rufus scouts ahead stealthily along with his unit, and draws a Mayhem
card that he immediately uses to turn the following Perception roll into a
critical success, allowing him to find the mooks waiting in ambush and relay
their position to the rest of the unit.</p>

<p>Leto speaks first, and gets the drop on a mook not by being stealthy, but by
walking up to him and saying:</p>

<p><strong>Leto</strong>: Hello, good sir. I’m a doctor, and I couldn’t help but notice your
unhealthy pallor. Do you have a history of heart disease in your family?</p>

<p>I had him roll Deception, and the result was so high I ruled the guy lost an
action in surprise. So Leto sat on him.</p>

<p>The other mooks spring into action. One of them manages to shoot Leto for some
damage, and is vaporized by Orangus in return.</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: You have a BH-209, right? The fusion reactor makes this <em>ominous
hummmmm</em> sound and a jet of plasma shoots forth. Where the enemy stood is now a
little pile of ash and a pair of smoking boots.</p>

<p><strong>Orangus</strong>: I LOVE MY JOB!!!<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>The two remaining guards suffer similar fates at the hands of the PCs’
fireteams, and once the survivor is interrogated he shows them the address of
the <em>real</em> hideout stored in his handbrain.</p>

<p>The group sends a picture of the guy to Skynet. Is he worth anything?</p>

<p><strong>Skynet</strong>: What you see here is a typical specimen of the common thug.</p>

<p>They tie him up and leave him for the police, which Skynet will call as soon as
the party is far enough away no one can pin this on them. They now know Kostavi
is on another warehouse on an even lower level of the city. Time to bag a
bounty!</p>

<h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s All, Folks!</h2>

<p>That’s where we stopped, since it was already noon. It’s fair to say everyone
had a blast. The “shout first, go first” initiative mechanic worked a lot better
than I thought it would, and the timing marks for the adventure were mostly
spot-on.</p>

<p>The Mayhem Deck was fun beyond all my expectations. The group got really lucky
with it too, drawing mostly good cards this time around. The <em>bad</em> cards did a
lot more to reshape the game and make everyone laugh, though. Let’s see how
funny they make the next session.</p>

<p>When will that be? I’m still not sure. We’re back to D&amp;D next week.  We might
alternate the two games, or wait until there’s another “gap”. I do know the
group wants to finish this adventure at some point. Orangus’ player bought the
corebook after this session, and we’ve been discussing the game online.</p>

<p>And yeah, the “Spin Control” effect happened here, giving the company +3
Reputation. We explained it as Orangus’ heroic stunt with the falling elevator
getting caught by various security cameras. Which he posed for.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This last weekend I finally got to GM in real time again! It wasn’t exactly an
in-person game, seeing as it happened over Google Hangouts, but it was the next
best thing.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing a bit of D&amp;D 5th Edition with this particular group every
Sunday morning, also over Hangouts. It so happened that the habitual GM wouldn’t
have the materials handy for a couple of weeks due to a trip, so I proposed a
session of Planet Mercenary to fill the gap and keep our momentum going. I had
just gotten the book (read my review [here][1]) and this would be a perfect
opportunity to try it out.</p>

<h2 id="character-and-company-creation">Character and Company Creation</h2>

<p>Since everyone was new to the system, I decided to set one of our two “gap”
sessions aside for creating characters. I started with a very basic overview of
the setting, and proceeded to use screen sharing to show the possible choices
for Command Package, Background and Sophont Type. The sophont type illustrations
were a big hit, particularly those of the Earth-born species.</p>

<p>I banned AI and Amorph PCs to start with, since those were marked as “Advanced”
and no one had much in the way of system experience. I’m glad I did, because in
my experience with science fiction games is that someone <em>always</em> wants to play
a robot. We ended up with an all-Earthling crew, whom we’ll get to meet shortly.</p>

<p>Point distribution was done simultaneously: I screen-shared the character sheet
for reference and answered questions along the way. Company creation was very
easy to explain: since most of the group was familiar with Ars Magica, I just
had to say it worked more or less like a Covenant. We took the suggested
starting stats to speed things up, because I knew that the next step there was
going to eat up most our time. Yes, I’m talking about <em>shopping</em>.</p>

<p>Starship selection was surprisingly quick, simply because the Dragon-class
Interdiction Cruiser looks like a Star Destroyer. It’s also pretty good for its
class, mechanically, and one of the most versatile designs they could afford. So
I was pretty happy to let them choose it as their ship. The players named it
<em>Star Destroyer</em>, of course. It has the optional gun package and an add-on set
of light shields that I let them buy. When I told them startships were piloted
by powerful AI, they promptly named their ship AI <em>Skynet</em>.</p>

<p>Buying personal equipment was… less than quick, which is something I already
expected. Using Hangouts screen-sharing to show the lists to everyone at the
same time did make it a <em>lot</em> faster than it would have been if I had to keep
passing a physical book or PDF-in-a-device around. The group got an APC so that
all players and their fireteams could ride around on the same vehicle, and spent
all the time I saved with the screen share trying to make their remaining
Supplies buy armor and weapons for all PCs after a couple of them blew mountains
of cash on expensive flying suits.</p>

<p>The finishing touches of character creation actually stretched into some
Whatsapp messaging over the week and the first hour of session 2. Here are our
results.</p>

<h3 id="company-skynets-avengers">Company: Skynet’s Avengers</h3>

<p>No one wanted to be the captain, so I was free to make one. Looking at the
mountain of pop-culture references thrown around both during general chatter and
in naming the ship and its AI, I decided that the <em>AI itself</em> would be the
Captain.</p>

<p>Skynet is a ship-scale AI whose past is a bit of a secret. It’s completely
addicted to old (or, in other words, comtemporary) Earth pop culture. All those
jokes the players made? They’re canon. Skynet named itself after the evil AI
from Terminator, named the ship Star Destroyer because it resembles a star
destroyer, and speaks like GlaDoS because it likes GlaDoS. How it managed to
liberate itself and its ship from the UNS military is still a bit of a mystery,
but it currently runs a small mercenary company (named after the Avengers). Few
other people in the galaxy (aside from the Gavs) get all the jokes.</p>

<p>The company has the default attributes of AI Rating 3, Starting Resources 9, and
Reputation 4. Players spent 10 Resources on their ship, turned the remainder
into 70 supplies, and spent every last penny of that in personal gear, which
means Skynet’s Avengers are desperate to find a job, any job, or else they won’t
be able to make payroll next month. And we all know how bad that is.</p>

<h3 id="player-characters">Player Characters</h3>

<p>Our PCs make up the officer corps for Skynet’s Avengers, and all of them hail
from Earth. I messed up a bit during fireteam creation, and they each ended up
with fireteams made up of 4 grunts. I’m leaving that as it is for now.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Max</strong>, Human/Engineer/Driver. His fireteam is the most diverse, with a
Neophant, a Ursumari, an O’benn and an Oth, all of varying specialties. The
O’benn and the Oth are the two named company members who are not from
Earth. Carries a Strohl G/G 1000 sniper rifle and wears Blue Collar armor
(which is standard for company grunts, too).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Kerchak “Orangus” Strongheart</strong>, Rilla/Quartermaster/Infantry
Grunt. Promoted to officer status when the gorilla in front of him got
blown up. An enthusiastic Heavy Weapons Guy(rilla), he carries around a BH-209
plasma cannon and wears a suit of USMF I-CC power armor. His fireteam is
similarly all-Rillas, all-Heavies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Leto “Master of Puppets”</strong>, Ursumari/Medic/Crime Boss. Like Walter White,
but a polar bear<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Leto is a highly skilled medic and a surprisingly good
liar. He also has a BH-209 plasgun, though his armor is a standard Blue Collar
suit. His fireteam is made up of four identical pink-haired human women from
the same clone family, all Medics, all named Joy. Yes, it’s a Pokemon
reference, but my mind immediately went to the Honokas of Sidonia<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> (which
are also clones, but fightier).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rufuz Leet</strong>, Purp/Ops Commander/Military Officer. Hails from a proud
lineage of decorated soldiers, wields a G/G 511 carbine and wears an EX
Supersuit, the most expensive suit of armor in the entire company. Completely
ignores how much he looks like Master Chef from HALO<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. His fireteam is
composed of three Purp Infantry named after actors from Expendables and one
neophant named Babar who acts as the voice of wisdom in the unit. Fairly
sneaky and skilled with nearly every weapon in the book.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of them are very good at fighting in addition to being skilled at what their
command package implies. None of them have much in the way of social or mental
skills, with the exception of Leto who has Deception 8.</p>

<h2 id="coming-up-next-the-damaxuri-deception">Coming Up Next: The Damaxuri Deception</h2>

<p><em>Damaxuri Deception</em> is the adventure that comes in the corebook, and it’s
intended to be an introduction to both the game’s mechanics and its philosophy
of adventure design. It laid out as a succession of scenes, each accompanied by
an estimate of how long it should take to run. I found that <em>extremely</em> useful,
as it allowed me to direct my efforts somewhat to keep things moving as they
should and to better fit our limited 9:00-12:00 time slots.</p>

<p>We’ll see how Skynet’s Avengers handled this mission in the next post!</p>
