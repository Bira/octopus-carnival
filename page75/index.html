        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/29/dragons-dogma-big-picture.html">previous</a> <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/30/adventuring-in-gransys.html">posts</a> I mentioned that the map of
Gransys is “truncated”. We’ll take a look at why that is today. We’ll
use <a href="http://dragonsdogma.wikia.com/wiki/File:Gransys_map_large_w_labels.jpg">this map</a> as a reference in this article. Be warned that it’s a
fully annotated map, so it contains spoilers for the console game! We’ll also
touch on certain story elements that can be equally spoilery.</p>

<p>As you can see, Gransys looks like somewhat like a capital J. It has coastlines
to the south and east, and is surrounded by nigh-impassable mountains on the
other sides. Its southern reaches are temperate and relatively flat, with the
southeastern coast being warm enough that its inhabitants tend to wear light
clothing. The region north of the capital is noticeably colder and hillier.</p>

<p>Looking at the location labels, we see that signs of civilization
are few and far between. Aside from a few castles, there are only two proper
settlements: the isolated fishing town of Cassardis, and the cosmopolitan
capital of Gran Soren. These are the only two places where you can find normal
civilians going about their daily lives.</p>

<p>The reason for this is simple: there are only so many resources to go around
when developing a video game, both in terms of time and money and in terms of
memory, storage and processing power of the target platform. Thus, every place
in the game fulfills a very specific purpose. They’re either commercial hubs,
dungeons, quest sites, or the bare minimum of “wilderness” necessary to give you
the feeling that you’re traveling in a fantasy world. That last bit is why the
map has no scale, by the way.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we are not quite as constrained here! Our imagination has more than
enough space to let Gransys unfurl to its full size. But what size should that
be? To find that out, I took the <em>totally scientific</em> approach of booting up the
game and walking places while timing how long it took.</p>

<p>If you set out from Cassardis at sunrise, you will arrive at the Shadow Fort
shortly before sunset, roughly 25 minutes later<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. This means that an in-game
hour passes in around 2 minutes of real time. Assuming my lightly encumbered
Mystic Knight has Move 5, she walked for 12 hours at 2.5 miles an
hour<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. That’s a total of 30 miles, or 48km from east to west. The north-south
dimension, from Cassardis to the Blighted Manse, is roughly 1.6 times as long:
48 miles, or 77km.</p>

<p>That’s smaller than I thought! If Gransys was a modern location with good
roads<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, you might be able to drive across it an hour or less. It’s still
quite larger than its in-game layout would indicate, of course, and those
distances are made all the longer by its medieval tech level. If we follow the
advice spread out through the GURPS material on the topic, there should be a
small village every 5km or so in the most hospitable stretches of land, with
the occasional larger market town linking them into a trade network.</p>

<p>“Small” would mean 100-200 people, organized as either a group of houses working
the fields around them, a group of isolated homesteads, or a single large manor
belonging to a local lord (a landed knight or the equivalent). Most houses would
be made of wood with thatch roofs, and most inhabitants would be peasants and
farmers. They might have blacksmiths and other craftspeople, but are just as
likely to have those needs served by wandering peddlers. Settlements of this
size would dot the plains west and north of Gran Soren, and around the
Eradication Site in Southern Gransys. There would also be a few around the
Encampment, though that stretch of land is quite narrow in the game.</p>

<p>Trade towns would have houses made out of stone with shingled roofs. They would
house their share of peasants and farmers (or fishers!) as well, but would also
concentrate more specialized craftspeople that supply a wider area around the
town and might be able to supply an adventuring party with gear. This would also
be the minimum settlement size where one could find inns and merchants with a
fixed address. Cassardis is one such town and there would be more in the South
Gransys plains and north of Gran Soren. In fact, the spots where you can find
those tiny camps with a peddler and a guard doubling as an innkeeper should
probably be trade towns instead.</p>

<p>The next step up from that would be castle towns, whose farms and trades support
a sizable fortification. Part of the town’s buildings would be built inside the
castle’s walls, and the inhabitants would know to run inside in the case of
attack. Finding armorers and such is much easier here than in the smaller
locations. Castles are run by barons or counts, depending on how large the area
they control is. These would obviously be around the castles we see on the map:
the Shadow Fort, Greatwall, and Windbluff Tower.</p>

<p>The only real big city in Gransys is Gran Soren. It’s home to thousands, it’s
well-fortified, and it contains the most well-stocked stores and the best
craftspeople.</p>

<p>Even small villages are pretty much self-sufficient, and most common villagers
would never travel further than about 10 miles (16km) from their home
village. It makes sense that the fishermen of Cassardis wouldn’t know much about
the Arisen! Some people are a fair bit more well-traveled or cosmopolitan than
that, like the nobles who send you on quests all the way across the duchy or the
NPCs who ask to be escorted to those same places. Most news from “outside” are
likely to come from these bold souls, or from similarly bold wandering peddlers.</p>

<p>That gives us a pretty nice canvas to work with! In future posts, we’ll go a bit
deeper into Gransys’ society and notable settlements, with attending GURPS
stats.</p>

            <p><strong>Update</strong>: This is the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy version of the character. If you
want to see a version for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG, click <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/25/pathfinder-dfrpg-barbarian.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>As I write this, I noticed that we’ve had a handful of GURPS posts already and
none of then has included any GURPS stats yet! I’ll try to remedy that
here. Since it might be a while until I have concrete rules to show for the
Dragon’s Dogma project, I’ll go with something completely different for this
post.</p>

<p>As you might know, Steve Jackson games recently completed a very
successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/847271320/dungeon-fantasy-roleplaying-game-powered-by-gurps">Kickstarter campaign</a> to finance the production of a
standalone Dungeon Fantasy boxed set. This gets me in the mood to do something
DF-related. Following the general Octopus Carnival theme of “adaptations”, I
decided to adapt the Pathfinder Iconic characters to GURPS Dungeon Fantasy. From
what I can see, each of the originals is meant to both be a representative of
their character class in the Pathfinder setting and to have a unique gimmick
that helps individualize them. This should be just the right amount of
complexity to illustrate what DF can do, as well. I’m sure a lot of people have
done the same conversions in the past, but these will be <em>mine</em>.</p>

<p>I’ll take each of the DF templates from <em>Adventurers</em> and use them to recreate
the Pathfinder Iconic of the corrresponding class. We’ll pull material from
other books as necessary to cover that character’s distinctive style. This
should limit the complexity of the conversion while still providing an
interesting exercise. The end result might not have the same mechanic “feel” of
the original, but that’s a feature in our case: it will be a Dungeon Fantasy
character, not a Pathfinder character. I’ll try to comment on any notable
differences. Please also note that I’ll be using the current line of GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy PDFs, not the boxed set, which is still a few months away from
publication as of this writing.</p>

<p>The first template listed in the book is Barbarian. Therefore, our first
converted iconic is Amiri:</p>

</figure>

<p>Amiri’s full official bio and character sheet can be
found <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/amiri.html">here</a>. Judging from those, we can glean a few facts about her:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Amiri is good at outdoor survival in cold climates, since she returned from a
“suicide” scouting mission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amiri is of normal human size, but fights with an oversized sword that used to
belong to a frost giant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She’s fiercely competitive and doesn’t like being outdone at barbarian
heroing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She relies a lot on the d20 Barbarian Rage power when fighting, and might get
angry enought to lose her mind. In other words, the purpose of Amiri is to
flip out and kill people.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s how I think she should look like in GURPS:</p>

<h2 id="amiri-248-point-human-barbarian">Amiri, 248-Point Human Barbarian</h2>

<h3 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h3>

<p>Amiri spent 2 points in extra starting cash so she could purchase the big
sword.</p>

<p>Unlike the standard DF 1 Barbarian, Amiri lacks Gigantism, and thus is
SM 0. While I know there’s a “Short Barbarian” option in Dungeon Fantasy
Denizens 1: Barbarians, I don’t own that book and thus simply decided to remove
Gigantism from her character sheet and adjust the point costs accordingly.</p>

<p>Most of her discretionary advantage points went into the Huge Weapons perk that
allows her to wield the sword without penalty, and the Great Rage advantage from
DF 11: Power-Ups. Note that these normally require Gigantism - I waived this
particular prerequisite here.</p>

<p>Taking all of that into account, we have a perfectly playable DF character that
hits all the same points as the original from Pathfinder! In campaign play, good
choices when spending experience would be buying Combat Reflexes, the second
level of Great Rage, ST and weapon skills to make Amiri a better combatant, or
Absolute Direction along with more and higher Survival specialties to make more
skilled in surviving the wilderness.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In this post I continue the discussion of the “high concept” part of this
project. The <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/29/dragons-dogma-big-picture.html">previous post</a> finished with a summary of the pile
of material I’ll have when I’m done. In this one I’ll discuss what it’s good
for. What types of campaign can you play in Gransys?</p>

<h2 id="the-eternal-quest">The Eternal Quest</h2>

<p>One alternative that springs readily to my mind is to steal the plot of the
original game. The dragon comes, and the Arisen must confront it and uncover its
secrets. This has the advantage of providing a solid structure and focus to the
overall campaign, but also has the big drawback of holding no big surprises to
anyone who is familiar with the source.</p>

<p>Even if your players don’t know the original game, it’s better to not slavishly
adhere to its detailed sequence of events. The important story elements in the
original are its <em>revelations</em>, those moments when the player solves one of the
many riddles posed by the game. How you get there can and should vary
considerably.</p>

<p>This kind of divergence is helpful both because it keeps familiar players
guessing, and because it keeps the campaign itself fresh for the GM. It also
makes use of the strengths of the new medium, as a tabletop game will
undoubtedly offer far more possible resolutions to a given scenario than a
computer game can. Players will need little incentive to come up with these
novel solutions, and accepting that it’s OK for them to do so will turn their
creativity into another asset for the campaign.</p>

<p>One PC in this campaign must be the Arisen. The others can be either Pawns, or
human allies. Another interesting variation is to have <em>several</em> PCs be
Arisen. This can either be because the Dragon created more than one this time,
or because older Arisen decided to come out of the woodwork for their own
reasons.</p>

<p>The appropriate power level for a campaign of this kind would be 250 points or
more, the standard Dungeon Fantasy power level. The Arisen is always a very
capable individual, and so should be anyone who can fight by their side.</p>

<h2 id="just-the-dungeon-fantasy-please">Just The Dungeon Fantasy, Please</h2>

<p>You don’t <em>have</em> to bother with all this Arisen business if you don’t want to,
of course! Gransys is a perfectly adequate setting for a standard fantasy (or
Dungeon Fantasy) campaign even without that. Decades or centuries pass between
each draconic invasion, leaving plenty of time for people to get into unrelated
trouble in between.</p>

<p>Your party could be a normal group of adventurers who raid dungeons or take on
dangerous jobs for fun and profit. The expanded map we’ll be working on should
have plenty of space for you to fill with extra places to explore, and if the
original game is any indication the inhabitants of Gransys are always needing
someone to control the bandit and monster population or to go into dangerous and
remote spots looking for relics and rare ingredients.</p>

<p>This is pretty much a standard DF campaign with a more fleshed out map and a
variable amount of Dragon’s Dogma flavor. You could even just use the map and
not bother with any of the setting-specific character options if you are so
inclined. 250-point characters are still appropriate, as are “low-level”
125-point templates if the group wants that specific feel.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-the-dungeon">Beyond the Dungeon</h2>

<p>Gransys is also a good place for less dungeon-y fantasy campaigns. There’s
plenty of urban intrigue to be had in Gran Soren and the Duke’s court. Wandering
merchants and peddlers can lead quite eventful lives trying to make a
buck. Soldiers in a remote fort have to contend with monsters from outside and
morale problems from within. And it could even be interesting to step into the
shoes of a regular citizen in this monster-infested world.</p>

<h2 id="loot-and-pillage">Loot and Pillage</h2>

<p>Even if you decide not to use the setting at all, some of the supporting rules
material could still make its way into a campaign set elsewhere. This includes
character templates, any new items or item-related rules, and the
monsters. Dungeon Fantasy can always use more monsters, no matter what setting
it uses!</p>

<h2 id="so-which-will-it-be">So which will it be?</h2>

<p>Most of my efforts here will prioritize the first two approaches. This means they
will be geared towards a campaign mostly based on the Dungeon Fantasy rules,
with 250-point characters and lots of action. There will be rules to play Arisen
and Pawns, but the rest of the material should work perfectly well for games
without these things. I’ll try to include tips on lower point level games where
appropriate.</p>

<p>I will, however take some more time to detail the possible sources of intrigue
in the setting, so those wishing to to focus there will be well-supported.</p>

            <p>There are many ways in which I could tackle this project. The order of the
chapters in <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/products/gurps-adaptations">GURPS Adaptations</a> is as good as any. Therefore, we’ll
start our Dragon’s Dogma adaptation by looking at the setting’s high concept and
considering our general approach to converting it to GURPS.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-dragons-dogma">What is Dragon’s Dogma?</h2>

<p>Dragon’s Dogma is a video game originally released for the Playstation 3, where
it was shortly followed by a big expansion named “Dragon’s Dogma: Dark
Arisen”. The expansion contains the full original game and adds a several new
areas and features to it. More recently, the game was ported to PC.</p>

<p>This is an action game with RPG elements, set in a fantasy world. Its combat is
quite dynamic and its soundtrack excellent. Its setting contains quite a few
distinctive elements, which we will explore in detail below.</p>

<h2 id="spoiler-alert">Spoiler Alert?</h2>

<p>One thing I must get out of the way immediately is how full of spoilers this
series of articles is going to be. The game’s plot contains several important
twists, and while it does enjoy commercial success, it’s not so famous that I
can simply assume any potential reader has already played it.</p>

<p>This adaptation will mostly depict the setting as it stands before the game
starts, and discuss information that is common knowledge to the characters who
live there. There will be separate posts dealing with its deeper secrets, and
those will both contain spoilers be marked as such.</p>

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>

<h3 id="the-eternal-cycle">The Eternal Cycle</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Land and skies, and seas yearn</p>

  <p>Finish the cycle of eternal return!</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>From the Dragon’s Dogma song “Eternal Return”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This “Eternal Return” is the original game’s main theme. Every once in a great
while (years, decades, sometimes centuries), a huge rift opens in the sky of its
fantasy setting and an enormous dragon comes through. Every time this happens,
the dragon binds a specific human to it by ritually stealing and eating their
heart. This chosen victim is known as the Arisen, for instead of dying they
carry on living without a pulse, and possessed of a strange mental link to the
dragon.</p>

<p>Each Arisen is fated to confront their dragon. Those who are successful are
hailed as heroes, and often become rulers: there are at least two dinasties
started by former Arisen. In fact, the society of the entire world is shaped by
this cycle. This has happened many times in the past, and if there’s one thing
the inhabitants of this world can be sure of, is that it will happen again.</p>

<p>This theme gets a lot of exposure, pretty much constantly. Several of the
setting elements connected to it have existed in the world for so long no one
finds them unusual. Much of the game’s plot involves finding out ancient clues
about these draconic invasions. Plenty of NPCs will never stop reminding you
that the ruler of the nation where the story takes place is a former Arisen
himself. They will also constantly remind you that there’s a fight against the
dragon looming in your future. And the verses quoted above show up in one form
or another in most of the game’s soundtrack.</p>

<h3 id="antiquity">Antiquity</h3>

<p>The land is old, and that doesn’t just mean it’s full of dungeons,
either. Several landmarks you pass by regularly are structures build in ancient
times, and your chatty NPC companions will always remark upon this. Some are so
old no one even remembers who built them, or what they are for. Few people seem
to be curious about this, either, which is another sign that from their point of
view this stuff has just always been there.</p>

<h3 id="danger">Danger</h3>

<p>A small army of monsters enters the world along with the Dragon, and many others
are either native or managed to survive and form stable populations after a
previous invasion. While there are safe spaces for humanity here and there, the
space between them is monster territory. Several of the in-game NPC remarks and
plot points show that keeping even a minimum standard of safety is a thankless
job, and that major incursions are a constant danger.</p>

<p>Every time the player goes into a dungeon or transitions between areas while
inside one, the loading screen displays scary messages emphasizing how dangerous
the place is.</p>

<p>Often, when the player defeats a particularly nasty monster, nearby NPCs will
remark on how unusual and spectacular that feat is. “Normal” people can only
hope to stand against these in great numbers, and expecting losses.</p>

<h2 id="setting">Setting</h2>

<p>The setting of Dragon’s Dogma will be discussed in greater detail in future
posts, I’ll give a brief description here.</p>

<p>The whole game takes place in the independent duchy of Gransys, which shares an
unnamed fantasy world with several other nations from which it is separated by a
mountain range or by the sea. It looks and feels quite medieval, with NPC
clothing often remniscent of 13th and 14th century European attire (PC clothing
and gear tends to be more outlandish). Their speech patterns are distinctive as
well - the characters in this game do a better job of sounding medieval than
those in many others. The landscape is typical of Europe-inspired fantasy
settings, with forests, plains and mountains. The “age” and “danger” themes
discussed above are heavily expressed in the design of this landscape, too.</p>

<p>Other nations are mentioned by name, and some of the NPCs come from them, but
the player never goes there.</p>

<p>There is magic, and its existence is public. It is learned through the study of
arcane principles. Most characters are human, and are racially diverse. The
single nonhuman people (as opposed to monsters) are the Pawns. Pawns look human
but have a different, somewhat alien mentality. They mostly wander the land
working as mercenaries, but all have a special tie to the Arisen.</p>

<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

<p>What do you do as an Arisen in Dragon’s Dogma? You walk the land either
searching for answers to the mystery of the Dragon, or performing tasks for the
Duke to make the kingdom of Gransys a safer place. Both often involve entering
dark underground ruins, fighting a lot of monsters, and plundering their
treasure. The deepest, darkest secrets are buried in the deepest, darkest, most
dangerous dungeons.</p>

<p>The game is single-player, but party-based. You directly control the Arisen and
are accompanied by anywhere from one to three AI-controlled Pawns. One of those
you create with the same level of detail as the Arisen. The others come from
other players.</p>

<p>You belong to one of nine different “vocations”, which are in effect character
classes. Each one uses different equipment and has different abilities, which
you learn as you “rank up” in each vocation. It’s possible to go somewhere and
find a monster that’s vastly more powerful than what you’re prepared to deal
with at the moment.</p>

<p>Combat is real-time and fairly dynamic. Martial characters attack with weapons
and have a varied repertoire of techniques as special powers. Spellcasters use
staves and cast spells. Spells can consist of elemental attacks and buffs,
health and status healing, or debuffs. Matching elemental effects to enemy
weaknesses is an important strategy.</p>

<p>There is limited grappling, too, as it’s possible to restrain human-scale
enemies so an ally can kill them. It’s also possible to <em>climb</em> larger “boss”
monsters in order to reach their weak spots.</p>

<p>Most of the time is spent travelling on foot to important locations and
exploring them. The game’s cities are more than just abstract collections of
shops, but there’s only two of them on the map, with the rest of it being
dungeon/quest sites and the monster-infested hinterlands. There are plenty of
sidequests of the “kill X enemies” or “fetch X items” sort, and you <em>can</em> ignore
the main plot to work on them, but many can be completed as you work on said
main plot.</p>

<p>There is a vast amount of items and equipment available, and you can improve
your equipment by working with an armorer and providing them with payment and
specific materials (many of which are monster parts).</p>

<p>As in all games, there is some conflict between story and gameplay, but it’s not
especially jarring. The biggest element of this would be Gransys’ somewhat
truncated map. It only has two settlements with all its other locations
consisting of dungeon or quest sites, but the story implies the duchy is bigger
than that.</p>

<h2 id="adaptation-stragegy">Adaptation Stragegy</h2>

<p>Given Gransys’s overall look and feel, and what is expected of the player in the
original game, this definitely sounds like a job for Dungeon Fantasy! That line
will provide an excellent starting base, and only a little additional
customization should be required to cover the elements unique to Dragon’s Dogma.</p>

<p>What would these elements be? The first one is that it goes a bit beyond the
default DF assumption that “town” is an abstract place to buy stuff between
dungeon raids. “Town” is a concrete place, what goes on there is important, and
can be an adventure in itself.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it doesn’t to <em>that</em> much beyond the default assumption, as
we’ve seen. There are only two fully-detailed settlements in all of Gransys,
though the story implies there should be more. In our adaptation, we’ll expand
the in-game map to the size it’s supposed to be, and fill some of the extra
space with additional settlements. Or at least provide enough information
for the GM to come up with one when needed. This will also give us the added
benefit of more room to for dungeons and for wilderness adventuring.</p>

<p>Character-wise, some change will be needed to the default DF template set. All
magic in this setting is arcane, and most magicians are of the “staff and robes”
kind. We will also need an extra template or two to exemplify the “hybrid”
martial/magic vocations, which are the most distinctive. We should also come up
with a racial template for pawns, since they are a common sight. And, though not
every game needs to be about the Arisen, an Arisen meta-trait would be a useful
thing to have.</p>

<p>There’s no need to replicate each and every item and piece of equipment from the
original game in GURPS, as GURPS already has a quite serviceable gear list that
does provide some overlap. We might stat up one of two particularly distinctive
items, though. And the equipment enhancement system is distinctive enough that
it needs a tabletop equivalent.</p>

<p>The most work-intensive bit, and the one most likely to yield dividends for
generic Dungeon Fantasy games, are the monsters. There’s a ton of them, and DF
can always use more monsters! We’ll try to link them to already existing GURPS
versions, but some will need their own stats.</p>

<p>Finally, but no less important, we’ll take a look at each of these elements as
we go through them and discuss how they may be used in isolation in more generic
campaigns. This way, you can use this material for your own
“not-quite-Dragon’s-Dogma” setting.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Before I start with the whole Dragon’s Dogma thing, I would like to discuss the
process of adapting a video game itself. It will help explain my decisions.</p>

<p>The excellent <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/products/gurps-adaptations">GURPS Adaptations</a> contains a wealth of detail on
how to adapt traditional fiction into an GURPS campaign, and while a lot of that
is equally applicable to adapting from a video game I feel there are some
important additional considerations. These concern <em>gameplay</em>.</p>

<p>“Gameplay” is a term that encompasses everything you do in the game as a player,
as well as the workings of these actions. Different genres of games give you
different levels of insight into these workings, from the intuitive feel you get
for your jumping distance in a platformer to all the numbers an electronic RPG
shows you.</p>

<p>Fiction has no gameplay. Even the longest fantasy novel with the most lovingly
described magic system will never make its readers do anything other than read
the text to see what happens next. Video games are the exact opposite of
this. Even the most immersive and story-intensive of games will always demand
that you pay as much attention to its gameplay as you do to its story and
setting.</p>

<p>If you think this sounds kinda similar to adapting from one tabletop RPG to
another, you’re getting it!</p>

<p>Essentially, adapting a video game into a tabletop RPG campaign presents us with
all the difficulties of adapting fiction <em>and</em> with all the difficulties of
converting material from a different game system!</p>

<p>The more transparent those mechanics are, paradoxically, the harder they make
the adaptation effort. When adapting mechanics, whether from a video game or
from other tabletop RPG, it’s very easy to fall into the trap of trying to
convert them as closely as possible. While that can be an interesting
intellectual exercise, it rarely generates a simple and practical result.</p>

<p>My preferred approach is to rely on the strengths of the “destination” system as
much as possible, adapting the fiction and trying to recreate the same feel of
the original mechanics without getting hung up on its details. Whenever the two
conflict in the original, the fiction takes precedence. For games that are part
of a franchise, I pick from the bits of setting information and mechanics that
give me the most coherent picture (or at least the picture I like the most).</p>

<p>In the end, I hope to have a campaign framework that is enjoyable to play and
fits GURPS idioms. And I hope you agree with me about the result :).</p>
