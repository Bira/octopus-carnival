<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Dretches are the pond scum of the Abyss. The name “dretch” is likely a
contraction of “demon wretch”, because these things are weak, stupid and
stinky. Everyone bullies them back home, and more powerful demons love throwing
hordes of dretches at new opposition both to gauge their abilities and to enjoy
the sight of dretches dying in droves.</p>

<p>I think dretches used to be the souls of Chaotic Evil sinners in previous
editions, but that is not the case here. Demons in 4e don’t care about souls,
and no one who dies goes to the Abyss. These balls of rage and body odor just
spontaneously generate from the corruption of that plane.</p>

<p>In this edition, Dretches first show up in the Monster Manual 2, so we’re
getting a bit ahead of ourselves here. This is because they’re also present in
the Monster Vault. Since we have the space we’ll cover the MM2 and MV versions
each in their own entry.</p>

<p>In both cases, they’re Small Elemental Humanoids (demons) with Int 5 and
darkvision. They speak Abyssal but have nothing interesting to say.</p>

<h2 id="dretch-mm2">Dretch (MM2)</h2>

<p>Basic dretches are Level 2 Brutes with 44 HP, which very likely makes them the
first demon your PCs will ever encounter in a Heroic campaign. They possess the
usual variable resistance 10 (1/encounter). A Sickening Miasma emanates from
their bodies in an Aura 1 pattern. Each enemy inside the aura takes 1 damage
whenever they take a move or standard action. Multiple miasma auras are
cumulative, increasing that damage to a maximum of 5. Beware dretch mobs!</p>

<p>Their basic attack uses their claws, and they can also make an at-will Claw
Frenzy that allows them to make that attack against up to two creatures. The
Monster Manual 2 still had the damage bug, but these monsters are too low-level
to be much affected by it.</p>

<p>When a dretch dies it spills its stinky insides all over the floor. This Vile
Death creates a zone of poison on a Close Burst 1 pattern centered on the
dretch, which lasts for a turn and does 5 poison damage to any non-demons who
enter it or start their turns inside.</p>

<p>Do note that while the Vile Death deals poison damage, the Sickening Miasma
deals <em>untyped</em> damage. Being resistent to poison will not save you from dretch
funk.</p>

<p>The sample encounter in the MM2 is level 7! 1 level 7 bloodseep demon, 2 level 5
gnaw demons, and <em>eight</em> dretches. Whoever designed this really took that line
about waves of dretches in the lore seriously.</p>

<h2 id="dretch-lackey-mv">Dretch Lackey (MV)</h2>

<p>Monster Vault demons are strictly paragon tier or above, so it gives us the
Dretch Lackey, a Level 12 Minion Brute.</p>

<p>They lack the MM2’s dretch Vile Death and multiattack ability, but the attack
bonus and damage on their claws is appropriate for fighting early Paragon
PCs. They do keep the Sickening Miasma, which now does 2 untyped damage per
dretch up to a maximum of 10.</p>

<p>Having a huge crowd of Dretch Lackeys seems more appropriate than the
medium-large crowd of basic dretches from the MM2’s sample encounter.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>I guess I can kinda see why dretches were left out of the first Monster
Manual. Sure, they’re the classic low-level demons, but they don’t have much
more than tradition going for them. Still, the pull of tradition might be
enough - I did wonder where they were when I first looked at the MM entries.</p>

<p>In fourth edition, the Babau first appears on the Monster Manual 3. We’re
viewing them ahead of time because they also appear on the Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The general thrust of demons in 4e is that they’re not fond of complex schemes,
which are more of a devil thing. Babaus are one of the exceptions to that
rule. You see, there’s this demon lord called Graz’zt who is not a former
primordial like the other demon lords. Instead, he was an archdevil who got it
into his mind to invade the Abyss. Why did he do that? I don’t know. The lore in
the MM3 mentions the Blood War, but I didn’t think that was still a thing in
this edition. Maybe it’s a vestige of his backstory from Planescape, or maybe
the Blood War has a different explanation for its existence here.</p>

<p>Anyway, shortly after getting to the Abyss, Graz’zt was corrupted by the seed of
evil and decided to stay around and become a demon lord. Glasya, another
archdevil and daughter of Asmodeus, was not pleased by that. She went after him
and ran him through with her sword. When the drops of blood from that wound hit
the ground of the Abyss, they became babaus, and their number was so great they
drove Glasya back to the Hells, and their continued presence helped build
Graz’zt’s power base and make his claim to demon lordship stick.</p>

<p>Being the spawn of Graz’zt, babaus are extraordinarily subtle and cunning for
demons. This means they like to kidnap people to torture later instead of
killing them all right away. They can be found working alongside other demons,
even though they’re even less trusted than usual due to their continuing loyalty
to their creator.</p>

<p>They look like skeletally thin humanoids with dark gray skin coated in slime, a
spine-like tail, and a weird horn that looks like a scorpion stinger growing out
of the back of their heads. All of this in addition to the usual demonic claws
and fangs.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Since the babau is from the Monster Manual 3, its stats are identical in that
book and in the Monster Vault. It’s a Medium Elemental Humanoid (demon), and a
Level 13 Skirmisher with 127 HP. They run with Speed 7.</p>

<p>The babau has acid resistance 5, plus variable resistance 20 usable
2/encounter. It’s coated in acidic slime that deals 5 acid damage to anyone who
attacks it with a melee attack.</p>

<p>This demon has two basic attacks, a bite and a claw. It can only use one of them
per standard action, unless the target is granting combat advantage. Then it can
use both. Each attack only does about half the level-appropriate damage for a
skirmisher by itself, so the babau should really strive to gain combat advantage
when fighting. The bite also does 5 ongoing acid damage, or 10 if the demon is
bloodied.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the babau can perform a Murderous Abduction. This teleports
an adjacent creature up to 7 squares and then immediately teleports the babau
next to it. The victim grants combat advantage to the babau for a turn. This
recharges whenever the babau drops someone to 0 HP. I’m guessing it reserves the
power for then a PC is close to dropping.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m gonna have to go with “meh” on this one. Their backstory feels kinda
shoehorned in. They somehow brought back the Blood War and Graz’zt, both of
which I feel are completely unnecessary.</p>

<p>As for the babaus themselves, they seem a bit too hard to use properly, since
they absolutely must gain combat advantage to do level-appropriate damage with
their attacks. The abduction power makes it seem that they’d be best employed in
terrain with obstacles that are hard to overcome without teleportation, but then
they can’t teleport back even if they drop the abducted PC. And if the PC
doesn’t fall on that first turn, then the demon is now stranded far from its own
allies and together with an angry PC.</p>

            <p>The danger of thinking too much about something before putting words to screen
is that someone else might end up publishing a piece first that says what you
wanted to in a better way.</p>

<p>This just happened to me! There’s this blog called “It Came From the Bookshelf”
whose author John Frazer is reading through and reviewing his entire RPG
collection, and he recently published posts about the <a href="http://www.itcamefromthebookshelf.com/2019/10/transhuman-space.html">Transhuman Space
corebook</a>, <a href="http://www.itcamefromthebookshelf.com/2019/10/transhuman-space-broken-dreams.html">Broken Dreams</a> and now <a href="http://www.itcamefromthebookshelf.com/2019/10/transhuman-space-fifth-wave.html">Fifth Wave</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the main thing Mr. Frazer noticed in these posts is exactly the thing I
wanted to write about when I published that post on the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/12/13/on-cyberpunk.html">cyberpunk
genre</a>. Turns out that post started out as a big blob of text that discussed
THS. I decided to split it off into a series, published part 01, and somehow
never got around to polishing the rest of it enough. I gotta get my shit
together right now, or else there will be nothing left for me to say that Frazer
hadn’t said better.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-wanted-to-say">What I Wanted to Say</h2>

<p>Transhuman Space always bothered me at a fundamental level and for the longest
time I lacked the words to precisely explain how. Now those words are out there!</p>

<p>Transhuman Space markets itself as Big Idea Science Fiction inspired by what
were at the time of its writing the very latest Big Ideas. It’s in a way a
conscious rejection of the dystopic and apocalyptic tropes of “90’s RPG
cyberpunk”, and one of the things that bogged me down was an effort to describe
what <em>that</em> genre is all about. I’m still going to do it, but not today.</p>

<p>The game likes to name-drop the authors that inspired it, not just in its
bibliography but in the text itself. There’s Alvin Toffler who came up with the
concept of technological “waves”; there’s Richard Dawkins with his memetics; and
there’s Ray Kurzweil with his idea that we’ll be able to become immortal
software gods Any Day Now.</p>

<p>However, there’s another person whose influence over the setting is possibly
greater than that of the others, whose ideas are so taken for granted that he’s
not acknowledged anywhere in the books. I’m talking about Francis Fukuyama, the
guy who wrote the infamous “The End of History?” essay. This essay kinda
codifies the idea that Western liberal capitalism is the ultimate political and
economic model for humanity. You reach that, you win History, and everyone else
is just playing catch-up to you.</p>

<p>The essay was written in 1989, and it went from “well-received” to “gospel
truth” in the eyes of the developed West when the Soviet Union fell in ‘91. It
was expanded into a book in 1992, and influences a lot of terminology even
today. A “developing country” is just one that’s on the way to becoming a
“developed country” like the US and Western Europe are; if it has trouble making
the transition it’s because it has not embraced the tenets of the Ultimate Model
with enough gusto.</p>

<p>This same view is at the bedrock of Transhuman Space’s worldbuilding. The
nations who were “developed” at the end of the 20th century remain so at the end
of the 21st. Those who were “developing” also mostly remain so - they’re better
off than they were a century ago, perhaps even better off than the US was a
century ago, but they still have some “catching up” to do. The game’s definition
of “better off” is directly correlated to technological development. Better toys
equals better society. The whole “memetics” thing is part of that, since its
main narrative function is to make sociology into a hard science whose
development happens in lockstep with the other hard sciences.</p>

<p>Those who deviate from this model are pretty much the setting’s designated bad
guys, particularly the TSA. See, they follow this ideology called
“nanosocialism”, and you know it’s a dangerous and pernicious mode of thinking
because it has socialism in its name. Its core tenet is a rejection of the
concept of intellectual property, a concept which the core book asserts is vital
to maintaining peace, progress and sanity in a society that doesn’t have to
worry about material scarcity. It’s the only way a honest, hard-working
corporation can make money these days! And if corporations can’t make money,
technological progress stops! That means all progress stops! You don’t want
that, do you?</p>

<p>So the TSA are villains because they want to reach that state of technological
and social bliss enjoyed by the “proper” Fifth Wave nations by pirating their
tech instead of “earning” it. And of course they are all authoritarian
dictatorships who make weapons of mass destruction because if you already stoop
to Internet piracy no other badness is beneath you. The books try to present
some semblance of neutrality and even suggest you could run a campaign where the
PCs are working for the TSA or another info/nanosocialist outfit, but it does
that with the same perfunctory tone of someone suggesting it’s technically
possible to play as stormtroopers in Star Wars D6. Its published example
scenarios always show the TSA as antagonists.</p>

<p>Then there’s the nations in the asteroid belt and outer solar system, whose
anarcho-capitalism tends to be viewed as the next step in the refinement of the
“end of history” model. Everyone knows government regulations are the greatest
impediment to progress, so it makes perfect logical sense to do away with them
entirely. I mean, no wealthy CEO in their right mind would use unfettered
capitalism to exploit their fellow sapients. We’ve won History, that doesn’t
happen anymore!</p>

<p>I remember seeing a lot of forum posts by diehard THS fans that insisted it was
basically a realistic utopia and totally not cyberpunk, and I was silly for
thinking it was or should be. My response to that is simple.</p>

<p>Transhuman Space is absolutely a cyberpunk setting in every detail except for
one: it’s told from the perspective of the sinister corporations. If you took
almost any William Gibson novel and rewrote the story so it was told from the
perspective of its villains, their tone and setting would look a lot like
Transhuman Space’s. The gloomy Cristopher Shy art that peppers every book in the
line is not dissonant with the tone of the setting: it is, and has always been,
<em>spot on</em>.</p>

<p>And now I’m really glad to find out I’m not alone in thinking this.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Abyssal Eviscerators first show up in 4th Edition in the Monster Manual 2, but
since they’re also in the Monster Vault we’re getting to look at them a bit
early.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The name says it all, really. Abyssal Eviscerators come from the Abyss, and they
like to eviscerate. At Int 7, they don’t know how to do much else, but then
again they don’t want to. They frequently find themselves under the command of
stronger demons, or summoned by mortal demonologists of middling skill and
above.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Abyssal Eviscerators are Medium Elemental Humanoids (demons), and Level 14
Brutes with 173 HP. The MM2 and MV versions are identical aside from the fixed
math. They have Speed 5, Variable Resistance 15 (2/encounter), and no special
senses.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a claw, and they can also Grab at-will for slightly less
damage, an attack which obviously starts a grab if it hits. The MV version
specifies the demon can only grab at most two creatures at once, which is
sensible because it only has two large hands.</p>

<p>Abyssal Eviscerators can also bite grabbed targets as a minor action, doing 6
automatic damage to them. They can only do this once per round normally, but can
do it up to 3 times per round while bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>Nothing special here, really. These guys are basically paragon-tier evistros and
should be used in the same way.</p>

<p>Vrocks have been in D&amp;D for a long time now. They look like humanoid buzzards,
covered in dirty feathers and the occasional spike. A pair of functional wings
sprouts from their back, and they have lizard tails. They’re on both the MM and
the MV.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Vrocks have Int 12 but that doesn’t see to do them any good. Vrocks are famously
disloyal even among demons, betraying their current master as soon as someone
they see as stronger comes around. They’ll also frequently plot to overthrow
their superiors, though those schemes rarely amount to anything. In other words,
Vrocks behave just like Starscream! I can totally see a band of them pledging
loyalty to the PCs during an adventure, pinky-swearing they’ll turn good, and
backstabbing them in the worst possible moment. The PCs ḱnow it’s coming, and
the vrocks know the PCs know. How far can the PCs take this alliance before it
falls apart?</p>

<p>Aside from plotting and backstabbing, vrocks like to engage in wholesome demonic
pasttimes such as tearing people to pieces while laughing maniacally.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The MM Vrock is a Large Elemental Humanoid (demon), and a Level 13 Skirmisher
with 132 HP. It has darkvision and variable resistance 10 (2/encounter). It
flies with speed 8 and moves on land at speed 6.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 2 claw, and they can make a Flyby Attack where they
fly their speed and make a claw attack at any point along the way. This doesn’t
provoke opportunity attacks from the target of the claw.</p>

<p>They can also let loose a Stunning Screech that recharges on a 6, targets the
Fortitude of everyone on a Close Burst 3 and stuns affected targets for a
turn. This is not a selective attack, so the vrock’s allies can potentially be
affected by it!</p>

<p>When first bloodied, the vrock emits a cloud of Spores of Madness in a Close
Burst 2. This targets the Will of any non-demons in the area, does poison
damage, and dazes (save ends). So I guess this is what they have instead of
blood?</p>

<p>The MV Vrock loses its Stunning Screech and has fixed damage math, but is
otherwise identical.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I thought I was in for another bland rage machine, but what I got was Vulture
Starscream! They’re nifty. I’m a bit divided on the removal of the Stunning
Screech in the MV update. On the one hand stuns are rough, and non-selective
area attacks are a pain for your teammates. On the other hand it captures the
