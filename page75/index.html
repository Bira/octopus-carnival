            <p><a href="https://lichvanwinkle.blogspot.com">Lich van Winkle’s Return to Gaming</a> is a rather interesting blog I found
through <a href="http://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com/2020/06/new-blog-addition-lich-van-winkle.html">Dungeon Fantastic</a>. Its author started role-playing with D&amp;D basic
back in 1981, stopped around the mid-90’s, and is now coming back to the hobby
after a 25-year hiatus.</p>

<p>I found some of the post titles there interesting enough, and the blog itself is
new enough, that I’m reading it from the beginning. The <a href="https://lichvanwinkle.blogspot.com/2020/02/back-to-table-top-roleplaying-games.html">first post</a> proves
that it’s going to be an interesting ride, because this is someone who played
back when the old school was new and who says that “there is a lot of
myth-making in the OSR”. Me, I started playing shortly before Mr. van Winkle
here stopped, but I think I’ll find plenty to agree with.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/06/28/shadowrun-irony.html">The Great Irony At the Heart of Shadowrun</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>For a very long time Shadowrun was my favorite game system and setting. These
days I still like the setting, but my annoyance at a host of small details in it
is stronger than my wish to play in it as written. Still, it’s useful to think
and talk about these details. It allows me to figure out what I want to do
better in my eventual home-brewed rewrite.</p>

<p>One of these details isn’t small at all, however. In fact, I’d go as far as
calling it the great irony at the heart of the game, as the title of this post
implied. It was developed from some forum posts I made on RPG.net.</p>

<h2 id="but-first-the-good-parts">But First, The Good Parts</h2>

<p>I don’t want to be unfairly critical of Shadowrun<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I know a few people who
write for it, and the last thing I want is to give the impression that I’m
attacking them. I’m not. This entire article is my personal opinion and in no
way meant to disparage any of the fine people who are passionate enough about
Shadowrun to write for it professionally. So let’s begin by talking about
something that this game does <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>One of the best things about the setting design of Shadowrun is that it presents
players with a very clear mission-based structure. The infamous question of “But
what do we <em>do</em> in this world?” is answered very early and very clearly. This is
a game about completing dangerous missions for money, just like D&amp;D is about
killing monsters and looting dungeons. Someone asks you to play Shadowrun, 99
times out of 100 you know the rough overall shape that campaign is going to
take. You see a heist movie and you start thinking about it in the context of
Shadowrun in your head, even if it doesn’t have all the same style elements,
because the premise is strong.</p>

<p>Shadowrun nailed the answer to this important question so well that it kinda
spilled over to other similar games. It became the default playstile for
Cyberpunk 2020 against the wishes of its own authors, and it often gets adopted
as the answer to “what do we do” in Transhuman Space<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which is so adamant
about offering none in its pages.</p>

<p>Like a lot of Shadowrun setting elements, though, this structure has an
excellent <em>premise</em> but its implementation gives rise to a lot of unintentional
oddness. Or, in this case, to a Great Irony.</p>

<p>This irony, I think, emerges when the strong premise above gets combined with
AD&amp;D-style adversarial GMing, which was very popular when Shadowrun was first
written. I believe it to be entirely unintentional, since as far as I can tell
Shadowrun’s design methodology was mostly based on the Rule of Cool with a dash
of “everyone else does this”. If it’s intentional, though, it’s among the
greatest acts of trolling in all of gaming.</p>

<h2 id="isnt-it-ironic">Isn’t it Ironic?</h2>

<p>Okay, so the Sixth World is ruled by megacorporations who control every aspect
of people’s lives. Most of these people live hand-to-mouth and work themselves
to death in order to prop up the decadent lifestyles of a few billionaire
executives. “Wage slave” is pretty much a synonym for “low-level megacorporate
employee” in this setting.</p>

<p>But as the flavor text tells us, player characters are supposed to have managed
to escape this cycle of misery. They live in the shadows cast by those giant
corporate towers, and they have the skills to oppose the megacorps and make
their independent way in the world.</p>

<p><em>Or do they?</em></p>

<p>I’ll admit I don’t know how things are structured in the most recent
editions<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, but I remember that the Shadowrun Companion for Second Edition
contained detailed advice on how much money your PCs should be paid for those
risky missions.  I call it the “rent plus change” model.</p>

<p>According to the book, GMs should pay PCs enough for them to cover their
lifestyle payments (i.e, rent and food) for the next month, with a little bit
left over for resupplying consumables and eventually upgrading a piece of gear
after a while. This was <em>per month</em>, not per run. If you had only one big run
that month, it would pay this amount. If you had several, they would pay
proportionally less so you’d receive the same “rent plus change” amount.</p>

<p>This was perfectly in-keeping with the AD&amp;D school of GMing and design, which
demanded PCs “earn” their power and had cool gear that cost money as a
significant part of that power. If they earn “too much” money, they would get
“too powerful”, and no one wants that! If your players look like they do, it’s
because they’re cheating cheaters who cheat and should be punished for it.</p>

<p>Almost all published adventures started with a scene where the party met with
Mr. Johnson to discuss the job. In the vast majority of these adventures,
Mr. Johnson is a shady corporate exec working for one of the megas. And the GM
text for this scene always included the oh-so-funny “If the players refuse the
job, announce that the adventure ended, pack up your things and go home.” This
is a joke about how the PCs don’t have any choice but to take the job as
presented. In fact, the flavor text for the same scene almost always assumes
they’re hurting for cash just before they get that call from their contact
setting up the meeting.</p>

<p>So yeah, those fiercely independent PC shadowrunners? <strong><em>They’re all wage slaves
too</em></strong>. And the game advises the GM to keep them that way.</p>

<p>Were the original writers oblivious to these implications, or are they still
laughing today about how no one seems to have noticed? I don’t think I have seen
any official discussion about this contradiction in any of the books I’ve
read. It’s just taken as a given, and never questioned.</p>

<p>This central irony gets funnier when you add in two sets of rules that were
published in the same edition.</p>

<h3 id="orichalcum">Orichalcum</h3>

<p>An early SR2 sourcebook called The Grimoire contained rules for making magic
items. It required a lot of skill tests and time, and the materials were still
super-expensive, but the final monetary cost was cheaper than buying the item.</p>

<p>“Do you buy or make your items?” would have been mostly a question of personal
preference… if the book didn’t also have rules for making those materials from
raw natural resources. You could use them for enchanting or sell them for half
list price. You could even make orichalcum, the magical metal used in the
creation of the most powerful magic items.</p>

<p>Orichalcum was so expensive that a single 10-gram “unit” cost the same as a
sports car or as almost nine months of High Lifestyle. The process for making it
was time consuming and laborious, but not really dangerous or illegal. And a
skilled character could end up with multiple units of orichalcum at the end of
that process. Selling even a single unit would more than pay the cost of the
necessary equipment, which was reusable.</p>

<p>With these rules, a team of PCs that includes at least one magician has no
financial reason to run the shadows. They can just set up an orichalcum-making
operation instead, and live like kings.</p>

<h3 id="stolen-cars">Stolen Cars</h3>

<p>The Shadowrun Companion sourcebook includes rules for stealing cars and selling
them on the black market, which theoretically were meant to be used in a
campaign where the characters were gangers instead of Shadowrunners. You could
sell an entire stolen car for a fraction of its market value, or break it down
for parts and sell those over several days and get money equal to the car’s full
list price.</p>

<p>Stealing cars is of course illegal and dangerous, but it was trivial for the
typical PC party in this game. After all they have the skills to routinely break
into top-secret research labs full of intricate and deadly security measures.</p>

<p>The cheapest four-wheeled vehicle in the book was the Ford Americar, your
typical “generic crummy sedan” that filled every street. Stealing and
dismantling one of those every week would pay roughly five times the amount
recommended in the “rent plus change” advice in <em>the very same book</em>. Or perhaps
you could steal one limousine or fancy sports car per quarter. In either case,
it was again much safer and more profitable than running the shadows.</p>

<h2 id="shadowrun--irony--awesome">Shadowrun + Irony = Awesome</h2>

<p>When these two “oopsies” were first discovered, I remember seeing a lot of GMs
go absolutely ballistic over them. The accusations of “munchkinism” flew thick
and fast, but in true those GMs were mad that the PCs were doing something that
wasn’t in the script. They reveled in describing the disproportionate response
law enforcement or competitors would visit upon the PCs, which was just an
excuse to punish the players for veering off the rails.</p>

<p>Personally, I think these two altertane activities are fraggin’ awesome,
precisely because they allow the party to truly break free from the grind. If
your players decide to retire from shadowrunning and make orichalcum or boost
cars for a living, I fully believe that the right response is to play along and
make the campaign be about that! All of those things mentioned as hard blocks by
curmudgeonly controlling GMs are actually excellent adventure hooks. And I’m
pretty sure any decent player group is going to keep finding non-monetary
reasons to return to the shadows. There’s still people to help and megacorps to
destroy, after all.</p>

<p>So I say that the first thing a team of shadowrunners needs to do is to find a
way to leave classic shadowrunning behind for good. It’s a sucker’s game. Stay
independent, take care of your community, tear down the system, make the Sixth
World better.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Manticores are based on Persian myth, and have been in D&amp;D at least since the
days of BECMI. Here they are present in both the Monster Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Manticores are monsters with the body of a very large lion, bat-like wings, and
a vaguely humanlike face. Their tails are long, whip-like, and tipped with iron
spikes.</p>

<p>These creatures are sapient, but deeply stupid and even more deeply <em>mean</em>,
living up to their Chaotic Evil alignment. They claim large hunting territories
around their lairs and are known to extend them even further on a whim. Like,
say, when they discover a tasty village just on the other side of the current
borders. They specifically seek out sapient prey if at all possible. Their
favorites are humans and dwarves.</p>

<p>Tough technically capable of parley, manticores rarely bother listening. Those
who manage to get through to a manticore can sometimes appease them with bribes
of food, a tactic also used by smarter villains who want to hire some manticore
muscle. There’s absolutely no guarantee the manticore will show up for the job,
or stay appeased. Even manticores trained since they were cubs have a tendency
to turn on their handlers. Should the beast actually hold its end of the
bargain, it might end up serving as a mount for the villain commanding it.</p>

<p>Manticores have three rows of teeth that work a bit like a shark’s, often
falling off and being replaced by new ones. Loose teeth and spikes, often stuck
in mangled corpses, are a sure sign that you’re in manticore country. Despite
having all those teeth, they prefer to use their claws in combat.</p>

<p>Heraldry has them as symbols of unpredictable danger, viciousness and
cruelty. Manticore iconography is used in danger signs such as those meant to
keep people away from an unstable abandoned mine or the like. They’re also
adopted as symbols by groups such as evil mercenaries or bandits who want to
seem all edgy and badass.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual only has one manticore stat block, but the Vault has <em>four</em>,
each with a different role. That’s enough for you to make an all-manticore
encounter. They’re Large Natural Magical Beasts.</p>

<p>Manticores run at speed 6 and fly at speed 8. Their keen senses give them
trained Perception, and all of them can shoot those spikes from their
tails. They don’t run out of ammunition either. Perhaps the spikes magically
grow as soon as they’re fired, or perhaps there are so many to begin with they
have Enough(TM) for any given fight.</p>

<h3 id="manticore-mm">Manticore (MM)</h3>

<p>The classic model is a Level 10 Elite Skirmisher with 210 HP and the Mount
keyword.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a claw, and it can launch spikes out to Range 10. The spike
attack allows them to shift 3 squares either before or after firing. <strong>Manticore
Fury</strong> is a standard action that allows the beast to make both a claw and a
spike attack in any order. Every so often (recharge 3-6) the manticore can whip
its tail really hard and fire a <strong>Spike Volley</strong> (Area Burst 1 within 10).</p>

<p>Its mount ability is <strong>Guided Sniper</strong>, representing the fact that it allows its
rider to act as a spotter. This gives both the basic spike throw and Spike
Volley a +2 bonus to hit.</p>

<p>I’m tempted to plop a cheeky goblin atop a manticore, but realistically the
rider would be someone more badass - otherwise they’d just get eaten instead.</p>

<h3 id="manticore-striker-mv">Manticore Striker (MV)</h3>

<p>Essentially a regular version of the MM elite manticore, this one is a Level 10
Skirmisher with 106 HP. None of the MV manticores have the Mount keyword or
abilities.</p>

<p>The striker can shift 2 squares either before or after its <strong>claw</strong> and <strong>tail
spike</strong> attacks, and lacks the ability to make both in the same round. If
someone hits it, though, it can make a <strong>spike counterattack</strong> as a reaction,
shooting a tail spike at the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>

<h3 id="manticoer-impaler-mv">Manticoer Impaler (MV)</h3>

<p>This Level 11 Brute has 138 HP. Its <strong>claw</strong> and <strong>tail spike</strong> attacks do
Brute-level damage, and it also has a <strong>Tail Lance</strong> (melee 2 vs. AC) that can
grab a target by impaling it.</p>

<p>The escape DC on the grab is 19, and while grabbed the target takes ongoing
physical damage. While it has a creature impaled, the manticore’s flight gains
an altitude limit of 6 squares.</p>

<p>While it’s grabbing someone, the manticore can also use <strong>Prepare to Drop</strong>, a
move action that allows it to fly its speed and pull the target along. This
includes pulling them straight up! It’s not stated in the stat block, but I
think the manticore can choose to release someone it’s grabbing on its
turn. Damage from the drop uses standard falling rules (1d10 per 2 squares/10ft,
IIRC).</p>

<h3 id="manticore-spike-hurler-mv">Manticore Spike Hurler (MV)</h3>

<p>As you might have guessed from the name, this is the Artillery manticore. It’s
Level 13 with 100 HP.</p>

<p>It has the usual <strong>claw</strong> and <strong>tail spike</strong> attacks, with the spike being more
accurate and doing more damage. It can also launch a <strong>spike volley</strong> (area
burst 1 within 10) at will.</p>

<h3 id="manticore-sky-hunter">Manticore Sky Hunter</h3>

<p>This one is a Level 13 Soldier (Leader) with 130 HP, and it’s remarkable for
being a manticore that cares about its allies. It has a <strong>Shielding Wings</strong> aura
1 that grants allies inside a +2 bonus to AC and Reflexes.</p>

<p>Its basic attacks are the usual <strong>claw</strong> and <strong>tail spike</strong>, with the claws also
marking for a turn on a hit. As a minor action it can also let out a
<strong>Threatening Roar</strong> that automatically marks everyone in a Close Burst 1 for a
turn.</p>

<p>If any marked enemy within 5 squares makes an attack that doesn’t include the
sky hunter, it can use a tail spike attack on them as a reaction (<strong>Defender’s
Spike</strong>).</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The MM has two encounters featuring its elite manticore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11: 1 manticore, 1 galeb duhr rockcaller, 4 ogre savages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 2 manticores, 2 hill giants, 4 ogre thugs (minions).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the first one I think the manticore is serving as the galeb duhr’s mount,
having finally come across someone it can’t eat. While it’s funny to imagine the
hill giants trying to hide the manticores in the second encounter, I don’t think
that would work out very well for them.</p>

<p>I like manticores, they’re fun to run and fun to fight. The four MV stat blocks
give us a bit more variety in tactics while staying true to the core MM
concept. Perhaps you could take a pair of those and make them into Huge Elites
so that those giants can finally make their dreams of flying come true.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Magma beasts are probably the conceptial descendants of the Magmen of AD&amp;D 1st
Edition, which later turned into Magmin during 3.x. There are likely a few other
monsters that ended up in this entry as well. They appear only on the Monster
Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Magma Beasts are elementals of earth and fire, obviously native to the Elemental
Chaos. They seem to be a little more physical than the creatures that were
listed under the Elemental entry, in that they actually have metabolisms and
thus have goals other than to exuberantly rage for all eternity.</p>

<p>These creatures live in the most fiery patches of the Elemental Chaos, the ones
that contain rivers of flowing magma, active volcanoes, or at least large
amounts of ambient geothermal energy. They can be found in the world or the
shallow Underdark in similarly hot places.</p>

<p>They sustain their mineral bodies by eating various ores and clays found in
these environments, but they’re also quite capable of digesting lesser elemental
creatures and even organic beings!  Organics do have a lot of calcium and iron
in their composition, after all.</p>

<p>Some magma beasts prefer an organic diet, having acquired a taste for the flavor
or burned meat. That doesn’t necessarily make them people-eaters, though I guess
the stupider varieties aren’t going to stop and ask their next prospective meal
if it can talk. The lair of a people-eating magma beast will <em>not</em> be littered
with the valuables of its victims - it eats those too.</p>

<p>Sapient magma beasts (magma brutes and magma hurlers) can be reasoned with and
bribed with offers of food, so that’s one way you can find them working
alongside others. They’re also able to bully their dumber relatives into obeying
them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Magma beasts tend to be lower level than the creatures in the Elemental entry,
so they might be a good way to introduce your Heroic Tier PCs to monsters from
the Elemental Chaos.</p>

<p>The “stupid” kinds of magma beast are Elemental Magical Beasts with Int 2, while
the “smarter” kinds are Elemental Humanoids with Int 5. The lore makes me think
the stupid ones should be Beasts, since they seem to behave more like animals.</p>

<p>All magma beasts are immune to petrification, have 10/tier fire resistance, and
are slowed for a turn when they take cold damage. They have the Earth and Fire
keywords.</p>

<h3 id="magma-claw">Magma Claw</h3>

<p>This Medium beast looks like a stinger-less scorpion. It’s a Level 4 Brute with
64 HP and training in both Endurance and Stealth. It uses the latter to disguise
itself as a rock outcropping until a potential victim wanders into charge
range. It moves at speed 4, but charges at speed 8.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a claw that does a mix of physical and fire damage, and it
can also Spew Lava at-will (vs. Reflex). A hit with this does ongoing 5 fire
damage and immobilizes (save ends). I imagine the lava comes out of where the
stinger would be.</p>

<h3 id="magma-hurler">Magma Hurler</h3>

<p>This Medium humanoid is Level 4 Artillery with 41 HP. It moves at Speed 4.</p>

<p>Magma hurlers fight in melee with slams, and they can also form and hurl balls
of magma. These have a range of 15, target Reflex, and do fire damage; a miss
causes all creatures adjacent to the target to take a bit of automatic fire
damage. Don’t cluster up!</p>

<p>Hurlers are one of the two “smart” magma beasts. If you know Primordial, you
might be able to talk to them.</p>

<h3 id="magma-strider">Magma Strider</h3>

<p>These Large beasts look like those long-legged water strider bugs. They hunt
through the same endurance-based method ancient humans used, pursuing their
intended prey for hours until it becomes exhausted. They’re Level 10 Skirmishers
with 105 HP who move and climb at Speed 6, so they can keep up with most
terrestrial creatures.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 bite that does both immediate and ongoing fire
damage (save ends). They can often <strong>Burn Across the Battlefield</strong> (recharge
3-6), which allows then to immediately charge another target after hitting
someone with a basic bite. Their <strong>Burning Mobility</strong> also causes 5 fire damage
to anyone who hits them with an opportunity attack.</p>

<h3 id="magma-brute">Magma Brute</h3>

<p>This Large humanoid is the other “smart” magma beast. Left alone, they behave as
nomadic scavengers. However, as Level 13 Brutes, they’re right at the point
where they begin to bump into “proper” elementals and other more powerful
denizens of the Chaos, so they often end up bullied into servitude.</p>

<p>Magma Brutes have 156 HP, walk at speed 4, and have a fire resistance of 20 as
Paragon-tier creatures. Their single attack is a Reach 2 Slam that does physical
damage plus ongoing fire damage (save ends) and is in dire need of a damage fix.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 2 magma claws, 2 magma hurlers, and 2 fire bats. Perfect for an early
fire dungeon, and likely to make your tieflings and fire sorcerers feel
powerful.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 3 magma brutes and 1 beholder eye of flame. Oh, so that’s who likes
to bully the brutes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not terribly enthusiastic about magma beasts. However, I think it’s
refreshing to see an entry about what is basically dangerous fantasy wildlife
after so many instances of “kill this thing on sight” courtesy of the Monster
Vault.</p>

<p>Lycanthropes have always been a part of D&amp;D, which apparently took inspiration
from a mix of Holywood horror movies and a bit of traditional folklore. They are
present in both the Monster Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Lycanthropes are creatures who can change their shape to that of a humanoid, an
animal, or a bipedal, animal-headed hybrid. There are different species, each
associated with a specific animal. Contrary to popular myth, lycanthropy cannot
be spread via bites, nor are lycanthropes forced to transform in the full moon.</p>

<p>If I understand it correctly, a lycanthrope is more like an animal who happens
to be able to change into a human than the reverse. Many don’t feel comfortable
living for an extended time in human society, and fear discovery of their true
nature. They can reproduce normally with each other or with their related
animal, unions which always result in new lycanthropes. They can also reproduce
with humans, though in these cases their offspring is more likely to consist of
“shifters” who can’t transform completely (and were introduced as a playable
race in Eberron).</p>

<p>Villainous lycanthropes are the type that treats sapients as prey and who use
their shapeshifting to infiltrate polite society and gnaw at it from within. The
Monster Vault once again tells us <em>all</em> lycanthropes are like that. Guess it was
ghostwritten by that bigot Volo.</p>

<p>The myths about the bite do have a shred of truth to them, as the bite of some
lycanthropes can infect humanoid victims with diseases that might make them
behave in an erratic or “bestial” way.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Both books give us stats for the two types of lycanthrope most likely to fight
adventurers: wererats and werewolves.</p>

<p>In all cases their signature lycanthrope trait is the ability to change shape!
They can use a minor action to switch between their human, animal or hybrid
forms. As humans, they can use weapons. As animals, they can bite (and possibly
spread disease). As hybrids, they can do both!</p>

<p>Lycanthropes also have Regeneration 5, which is disabled for a turn when they
take damage from silver weapons. Due to the way regeneration works in 4e, you
<em>can</em> kill them without silver, it’s just harder.</p>

<h3 id="wererat-mm">Wererat (MM)</h3>

<p>Wererats are likely to be the first lycanthrope your PCs encounter, and also the
ones most comfortable with living in civilization. Wererat thieves’ guilds are a
classic staple of D&amp;D.</p>

<p>Here they’re Medium Natural Humanoids with the Shapechanger keyword, and Level 3
Skirmishers with 48 HP. They also have the common traits listed above. They run
at speed 6 and can climb at speed 4 in their non-human forms.</p>

<p>Wererats fight with short swords and bites. The bites do a little less damage
but also do ongoing damage (save ends) and spread filth fever.</p>

<p>Wererats gain bonus “sneak attack” damage if they attack with combat advantage.</p>

<p>Filth Fever is a level 3 disease. Stage 1 makes you lose a healing surge, Stage
2 also inflicts -2 to all your defenses, and Stage 3 keeps the penalty and takes
away all your healing surges and your ability to regain hit points. 4e disease
rules have you make periodic Endurance checks to see if you worsen, improve or
stay stable. Also I think you cannot recover on your own when you reach Stage 3.</p>

<h3 id="scurrying-wererat-mv">Scurrying Wererat (MV)</h3>

<p>This is much like the MM version, though its attacks are different.</p>

<p>This wererat’s weapon is a dagger, which does extra damage with combat
advantage. Their bite deals ongoing damage with combat advantage (save ends).</p>

<p>The Vault also specifies someone bitten by a wererat must roll at save at the
end of the fight to see if they contracted filth fever or not. The disease’s
effects are the same.</p>

<p>As a move action while in rat form, this wererat can use Rat Scurry to shift its
speed.</p>

<h3 id="frenzied-werewolf-mv">Frenzied Werewolf (MV)</h3>

<p>Werewolves are the most classic lycanthropes and likely the first to be statted
up for D&amp;D.</p>

<p>This one is a Level 6 Brute with 78 HP and all common lycanthrope traits. It
runs at speed 6, or 8 while in wolf form. Its weapon is a club, and both it and
its claws do extra damage against bloodied targets. They can also bite, and
bitten victims contract Moon Frenzy if they fail a save at the end of the fight.</p>

<p>In hybrid form, the werewolf can use Lycanthrope Fury to make both a claw
and a bite attack as a standard action, dealing 5 damage to itself in the
process.</p>

<p>Moon Frenzy is a level 6 disease. It doesn’t turn you into a werewolf, but it
penalizes your Will (Stage 1) and forces you to attack a nearby ally when you
become bloodied (Stage 2) and later on whenever you’re hit by an attack (Stage
3).</p>

<h3 id="werewolf-mm">Werewolf (MM)</h3>

<p>This one is quite similar to its Monster Vault counterpart, but is level 8 with
108 HP, lacks claws and Lycanthrope Fury and transmits a level 8 version of Moon
Frenzy.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that disease DCs are 3-4 points higher in the Monster Manual
versions. I guess they must have been lowered by the time the Vault was
published when the authors realized very few PCs ever trained Endurance.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get two in the Manual:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 2 wererats, 4 dire rats, 6 human rabble. Your typical wererat thief
gang.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 9: 4 werewolves, 4 dire wolves. A pack with extra punch.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The gothic/Holywood werewolf afflicted by a curse that turns then into ravenous
murderers on the full moon is a classic… but that’s not what we get here at
all. These lycanthropes are just another sapient species, and while there’s
nothing preventing some individuals from turning to evil, there’s nothing
compelling them to do so anyway (despite all the stat blocks we’re given being
Evil).</p>

<p>This makes the Monster Vault’s more aggressive stance feel like vile bigotry to
me. If you take it at face value you can say the Church of the Silver Flame was
right to genocide lycanthropes and shifters in Eberron, which to me is a clue to
not take it at face value.</p>
