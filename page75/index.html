<p>Back when I <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics/">statted up the Pathfinder Iconics for both versions of Dungeon
Fantasy</a>, I decided to work under a set of restrictions to make those
characters more “by the book”. The idea was that anyone who had either GURPS DF
or the DFRPG boxed set could pick the appropriate version and start playing.</p>

<p>Were I making those characters solely for my own use, however, I would have done
a few things differently. Like everyone else, I have a particular “house style”
shaped by my personal preferences. And like everyone else who owns both versions
of DF, I have a particular way of picking which version of the rules to use for
any given situation.</p>

<p>I plan to discuss those preferences in this article, for a simple reason: I want
to post more characters in this blog, and I want to make them according to my
own preferences. It’s useful for the reader to understand what those are!</p>

<h2 id="character-templates">Character Templates</h2>

<p>Any professional template from the main GURPS Dungeon Fantasy line or the DFRPG
box set are allowed. Pick whatever version you like best! You can also use any
templates published in Octopus Carnival. Templates from other sources are
subject to my review on a case by case basis, provided I have access to the
source in question.</p>

<p>The same goes for racial templates. In fitting with my stated policy on <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2018/10/18/peoples-of-tamriel.html">this
post</a>, however, I consider attribute adjustments and traits with a “cultural”
origin to be mere suggestions and not part of the template. If you want your
dwarf to be a hard-headed greedy grump, take those as individual disadvantages.</p>

<h2 id="traits-and-powers">Traits and Powers</h2>

<p><em>Most</em> traits and powers that exist in both versions of Dungeon Fantasy are
identical in both, but when that’s not the case I generally go with the cooler
or cheaper version. “Resistant to X” is the one that comes to mind here. I
prefer the DFRPG version because it’s slightly cheaper and more granular than
the default GURPS one.</p>

<p>If a power only exists in one version of the game, you’re obviously still
allowed to get it no matter where you took your template from. DFRPG bards can
learn Alarum, and DFRPG druids can have animal companions.</p>

<h2 id="spells">Spells</h2>

<p>I’ll be honest, my mastery of the GURPS Magic system leaves something to be
desired when compared to my knowledge of its other rules. I’m a fan of fighters,
what can I say? For this reason, DFRPG: Spells is the baseline magic book for
any campaign of mine. The spells in there are already pre-selected and
pre-edited for a Dungeon Fantasy campaign. Spells not present in that book will
be allowed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>The “canonical” weapons list for my campaigns is the one from Low-Tech, though
the one in DFRPG: Adventurers will do as a substitute in a pinch. As far as I
know, it just has less weapons. Weapon modifiers are the ones in DFRPG:
Adventurers. The “canonical” armor list is the one from DFRPG: Adventurers. The
Basic Set one feels outdated, and Low-Tech’s hit location rules are too complex
for me.</p>

<p>I haven’t had to deal with characters of wildly differing sizes yet, but I’m
tempted to use the scaling rules in vanilla DF when that happens. Just for
<em>armor</em>, though. For weapons, just pick an appropriate stat line for a smaller
weapon and wield it with the skill that feels right. For example, a pixie knight
might wield various knives with Broadsword, Two-Handed Sword or Polearm
depending on size.</p>

<p>Other gear should <em>generally</em> be taken from the DFRPG list, though I gather it’s
similar enough to most GURPS sources that you can take something from Low-Tech
or the Basic Set if you really want it.</p>

<p>The Tech Level is 4, when that matters. The availability of guns is decided on a
per-campaign basis.</p>

<h2 id="side-note-iconics-in-the-house-style">Side Note: Iconics in the House Style</h2>

<p>If I were to stat up the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics/">Pathfinder Iconics</a> in my “house” style, they’d
mostly follow the DFRPG templates, but freely borrow from the GURPS DF line for
powers. Kyra would get her fire spells, Lem would get his bard song, Lini her
pet leopard, Sajan his kopesh, and even Valeros his Dual-Weapon Attack. I guess
the exceptions would be Amiri and Merisiel, as I find their DFRPG selves
all-around better than the original.</p>

<p>I’m not going back and statting these bozos up a <em>third</em> time, though. I leave
that as an exercise for the reader.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>There’s this William Gibson short story, from way back at the beginning of his
career, called “The Gernsback Continuum”. You could argue it’s a neat
encapsulation of everything the cyberpunk literary movement was all about.</p>

<p>It’s about a photographer who gets hired to travel through the US and take
pictures for an art book, of buildings built using this very specific sort of
40’s-50’s architecture. You know the one: aerodynamic fins and flanges
everywhere, meant to look “futuristic” in a robots-and-spaceships kind of
way. Of course, the story takes place in the 80s so everyone there knows the
future these buildings were alluding to never came to pass. That’s what the art
book is going to be about, that nostalgic lost future feeling.</p>

  <figcaption>
    Sometimes the fins have flanges.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our protagonist gets so into it that he starts hallucinating that future. Silver
teardrop-shaped cars driving on the highway or flying in the sky above it. A
plane that’s a huge flying wing with twelve propeller engines, two squash courts
and a ballroom.</p>

<p>It culminates in an entire city (Tucson, IIRC) visible on the horizon being
replaced by a version of itself that’s all impossibly tall flanged towers linked
by crystal roads and swarming with those silver cars and with Beautiful People
in Togas. There’s a couple of them right beside our protagonist, though they
don’t see him. They talk to each other with sweeping gestures and bold
statements that can be summarized as “Isn’t the future great? And it’s all
ours!”</p>

<p>At that precise moment, our protagonist freaks the fuck out. I was a dumb
teenager when I first read this story, so I didn’t quite get what was so
horrible about that moment. Now I do. Every one of those Beautiful People in
Togas is white, blond and blue-eyed. <em>What the heck did they do to everyone
else?</em> Perhaps that lost future never coming to pass isn’t a bad thing at
all<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. In the end the protagonist gets rid of the hallucinations through a
steady diet of crappy media and headline news about the oil crisis.</p>

<p>The story’s title refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>, the man responsible for editing
the science fiction magazine <em>Amazing Stories</em> from 1926 to 1936. I’m guessing
everything our poor photographer sees comes from that magazine, too, or from
other publications influenced by its style stretching into the 50s. Gernsback
also lends his name to the Hugos, one of the two top literary prizes in the
field of SF.</p>

<p>The cyberpunk movement, whose writers would end up winning quite a few Hugos
themselves, was in large part a reaction to this style of science fiction. As
the introduction to Guardians of Order’s <em>Ex Machina</em> so aptly puts it,
cyberpunk stories were about outsiders trying to survive and find happiness in
the face of an oppressive society. Cyberpunk protagonists, Gibson’s in
particular, were often criminals, drug addicts, poor, kids, people of color, or
more than one of the above at the same time.</p>

<p>The worlds of classic literary cyberpunk had all sorts of social problems that
were directly inspired by the present in which those stories had been
written. They weren’t exactly extrapolations, but rather commentary on the
present. Since the stories were set in the future, I think they also ended up
presenting us with another message: those issues don’t just go away because
technology advances. If you ignore them today, they’ll still haunt you tomorrow.</p>

<p>By now I’ve read a bunch of online discussions where people say the cyberpunk
genre is dated or outright obsolete. We’re no longer in the Eighties. Things
have changed. The tech looks either retro or absurd to our modern eyes, the USSR
imploded, Japanese companies didn’t take over the world.</p>

<p>I feel this argument is kinda missing the point. The specific technologies and
setting elements that appear in classic cyberpunk stories are indeed a product
of their time, but they’re just props. The themes and motifs behind those props
are timeless. It’s quite possible to write a story with more up-to-date props
that still feels cyberpunk. Heck, Gibson himself never stopped doing exactly
that.</p>

<p>Overly focusing on the props is a mistake a I feel a lot of people
make. These people include a good number of RPG writers and fans,
unfortunately. I clearly remember reading an article that talked about just such
a thing once, but unfortunately I can’t remember where. So when I next talk
about this, I’m going to be writing my own version of that article.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/11/18/castlevania-ravenloft.html">On the Relationship Between Castlevania and Ravenloft</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>There <em>probably</em> isn’t a direct relationship between them. The original
I6 Ravenloft module came out in 1983. The original Castevania game for the NES
came out in 1986. On the one hand this was the 8-bit era, so it’s likely
Castlevania began its development after Ravenloft had come out. On the other
hand pen-and-paper RPGs were a small-scale hobby and no one had casual access to
the Internet back then, so it’s unlikely that Castevania’s Japanese developers
would have heard of the module.</p>

<p>Still, both Ravenloft and Castlevania very clearly get inspiration from the same
sources, and tell remarkably similar stories: one or more intrepid adventurers
enter a gloomy kindgom ruled by an ancient and cruel vampire lord, break into
said lord’s castle, and kill him with a weapon destined for the purpose<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The environments in both are heavily inspired by gothic literature and monster
movies. As games, both have a reputation for being quite hard. Strahd from
Ravenloft is clearly inspired by the literary Dracula, with a different name to
make him more copyrightable. Konami went the other way and named their vampire
Dracula while making him completely different in most other aspects.</p>

<p>I mention the original I6 adventure specifically because I think Ravenloft loses
quite a bit of its Castlevania-ness when it turns into a campaign setting with a
metaplot and that business with the Mists. The original adventures set up
dynamic scenarios: things are bad, and have been for a while, but the PCs are
fully expected to upset the apple cart as soon as they get into the picture. The
Ravenloft campaign setting, on the other hand, is just another static D&amp;D
setting where the only allowed changes are handed down from on high in the form
of metaplot.</p>

<p>Í haven’t really read the new-ish Curse of Strahd sourcebook<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, but I gather
it’s tries to turn I6 into a full campaign starting the characters at level 1
and lavishing praise on Strahd himself at every opportunity. Since I didn’t
really intend to use the rules as printed on either version I went with the
cheaper one.</p>

<p>There’s no deeper insight here. Just something I’ve been thinking off and on for
a while. I’m obviously not the first person to think of this: someone
home-brewed a campaign setting called Barovania back on 2012 or so which mixed a
lot of old-school Nintendo lore with the usual old-school D&amp;D soup. Finding a
link to that now is a challenge, but I remember reading it.</p>

<p>In any case, if you want a Castlevania experience in your tabletop, you can
pretty much run I6 Ravenloft as written and just convert the monster and item
stats to your system of choice. Maybe use the Castlevania soundtrack as mood
music. There are quite a few organ arrangements for it too. You could also forgo
the random placement of the special treasures and make it so one of them is in
a place that’s easy to see but impossible to reach without first finding the
other.</p>

<p>For extra franchise power, after your group beats Strahd, run Ravenloft 2: The
House on Gryphon Hill as a sequel by having it take place 100 years later and
feature the descendants of the PCs in the first adventure. All the thematic
stuff you need is already in there and pretty system-neutral.</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>You can technically kill Strahd without finding the Sun Blade first if

</figure>

<p>Welcome back to Let’s Read Hell’s Rebels! This post will cover Part 2 of the
second adventure, Turn of the Torrent. <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/07/hells-rebels-2-part-1.html">Part 1</a> had the PCs meet with former
Torrent Hellknight Octavio Sabinus, who promised to join the Silver Ravens
should the PCs rescue his knights from the Old Kintargo Holding House.</p>

<p>Part 2 covers that rescue mission and several other events that happen in the
neighborhood of Old Kintargo. According to the book, its inhabitants are both
the most distrustful of outsiders and the most likely to join the rebellion when
properly inspired, since they have a long tradition of defying Chelish rule in
small ways.</p>

<p>Like in the first adventure, the missions are numbered but can be completed in
any order.</p>

<h2 id="but-first-some-setup">But First, Some Setup</h2>

<p>In a remarkable display of slavish adherence to its adventure outline template,
the book literally ends its Part 1 while the party is mid-conversation with
Octavio Sabinus. You then need to go through two pages of background info and
optional events in the Part 2 before returning to the details of what Sabinus
wants the PCs to do. While the scene on Part 1 does include a page reference
to these details, it’s still a bit of an awkward read.</p>

<p>Anyway, Part 2 begins by recommending that the PCs make the Tooth and Nail
tavern a temporary staging area, since all its events happen in the same
neighborhood. It describes some tavern games that are common there, as well as
an NPC they can meet who is actually Part 3’s main villain in disguise.</p>

<p>Then it describes Proclamation the Tenth, where The Barzilai outlaws the works
of several poets and writers whose works mock House Thrune. Three of them are
long dead, but one is “The Poison Pen of Kintargo”, an NPC who will become
relevant in Mission 2. If one of the PCs is also a poet or writer, their name
should also be on this list, which is the bit I found really interesting.</p>

<h2 id="optional-encounter-being-followed">Optional Encounter: Being Followed</h2>

<p>This optional encounter is where Thrune hires a mercenary detective to follow
the PCs around and report on their movements. Tayacet Tiora is the sort who
claims to ignore politics in favor of getting the job done, but the book says
she will slowly come to realize Barzilai is bad business all around in future
adventures. Any encounters the PCs might have with her here are stated to be
mere foreshadowing for her appearance in future adventures, and she could be
left out entirely.</p>

<p>That’s likely for the best, to be honest. Tiora might look cool, but the PCs
won’t take kindly to being followed by an agent of the enemy and will be even
more frustrated when she makes her scripted escape.</p>

<h2 id="mission-1-rescue-at-the-holding-house">Mission 1: Rescue at the Holding House</h2>

<p>And here we are, picking up on the Octavio conversation as if the intervening
pages didn’t exist.</p>

<p>When discussing the details of this mission, Octavio Sabinus will give them his
prized mithral short sword, explaining it belonged to his mother. Showing the
sword to his knights and repeating that bit of info should serve as proof of the
PC’s allegiance, and help secure their cooperation. The sword itself should also
be useful against any devils they run into.</p>

<p>The Holding House is not the most secure prison in the city, but it’s still
locked down pretty tight. While the adventure describes the place in sufficient
detail for the PCs to make a frontal assault or attempt a sneaking mission,
Octavio’s suggestion of showing up with forged prisoner transfer documents is
the plan with the biggest chance of success here.</p>

<p>The book lists the requirements for forging the papers, and details an NPC
forger the group can hire if none of them are very skilled at it. Opposition
here consists of a total of eight dottari guards with the same stats as the one
encountered in Part 1, plus their slightly weird commander Warden Sabo. More
guards will show up at regular intervals if a fight breaks out.</p>

<p>Good forgeries and some fast-talking should get them past all of these people
and into the cells, which contain three of the four knights they’re supposed to
rescue. The fourth is currently being tortured by the scalpel devil.</p>

<p>Oh, I didn’t mention the scalpel devil? It’s like a chain devil, but covered in
scalpels instead and with a host of powers to detect lies. It’s in a soundproof
room deep within the prison, and even if the party tricks the guards they will
still likely end up fighting it to get the last prisoner out. The guards don’t
like this thing a whole lot, and won’t be in a rush to enter the soundproof room
or to ask the PCs how they got its latest victim out alive. Therefore, it’s
entirely possible a particularly convincing party will talk their way into the
devil’s cell, kill it, and talk their way out with all four prisoners in tow.</p>

<p>Getting the knights out without killing a single human guard is worth XP as if
the party had defeated the lot in combat.</p>

<h2 id="mission-2-the-poison-pen-of-kintargo">Mission 2: The Poison Pen of Kintargo</h2>

<p>The quest giver here is Cassius Sargaeta, a captain in the Chelish navy. Not
being a Kintargo native, he’s confined to his ship by Proclamation 8. Sargaeta
hasn’t left town yet because his lover Marquel Aulorian (noble scion and
secretly the Poison Pen of Kintargo) is under house arrest and likely being
sought by Thrune agents for criticizing the government in his writings. Sargaeta
wants the PCs to deliver a letter to Marquel and bring him to the ship.</p>

<p>The PCs learn this on a meeting with the captain, after being invited into the
ship by his first mate, a sassy half-elf gunslinger. Now, it’s quite likely the
PCs will be slow to trust members of the friggin’ Chelish Navy, so a good amount
of this section’s text is dedicated to what happens if they don’t agree to see
him.</p>

<p>The Aulorian estate is defended by human guards who are less beefy than the
dottari, and by a three-headed hellhound. As usual, discretion is advised unless
the PCs want their notoriety increased.</p>

<p>Reuniting the two lovers will net the Silver Ravens a substantial reward: the
captain asks one of the PCs to drop a porcelain teacup on the floor, and
provides the Ravens with favors equal in number to the resulting shards. That’s
a fancy way of saying 1d10, but the book also suggests getting an actual
(cheap!) cup and getting a player to drop it for extra effect.</p>

<p>It seems to me the whole deal is meant to come off as dubious until the very
end. Sargaeta is described as a “Chelish patriot” who is unhappy with Barzilai
specifically but not his government in general. His first mate is cheerfully
unpleasant, and he keeps a halfling slave as a maidservant (the adventure
doesn’t spell that last bit out, but Lem’s backstory is very clear that the
Chelish love enslaving halflings).</p>

<p>Despite all this, getting the Poison Pen to safety is a good thing for the
rebellion, and the 1d10 favors gained as a reward are <em>really</em>
valuable. Sargaeta will agree to anything short of open treason, which means he
will lend his crew for covert actions, provide discreet transport to the Ravens,
deliver a lump sum of money, and so on. If using the scene as written, the best
thing to do would be to play up the gray morality of the situation. GMs who are
uncomfortable with that or who don’t believe their players would take on the
mission as written could replace Sargaeta with a more sympathetic foreign
captain.</p>

<h2 id="mission-3-on-the-slashers-trail">Mission 3: On the Slasher’s Trail</h2>

<p>The text of this mission begins with a brief bout of exposition on the Temple
Hill Slasher, a serial killer who plagued Kintargo a few decades ago and whose
killings are still part of the local folklore. In other words, a fairly obvious
Jack the Ripper expy. The main difference here is that the Slasher was
eventually caught. Only it seems like the killings have started again, using the
exact same MO.</p>

<p>The rumor table at the start of adventure includes some entries dealing with
this new Slasher, and they pay off on Mission 3. The PCs are contacted by a
tiefling tailor named Hetamon Haace, who reveals he’s the leader of the Rose of
Kintargo: a cult of Milani<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> worshippers who’s been laying <em>extremely</em> low as
of late. As is often the case with these NPCs, he’s fully aware of any Silver
Ravens exploits the group hasn’t taken pains to conceal.</p>

<p>Haace feels compelled to ask the Ravens’ help because a member of his own group
has been killed by the new Slasher. He wants their help in tracking the murderer
down and will offer the services of the Rose in return. This will mostly consist
in helping keep the heat off the Ravens’ backs, but they will rise up and help
the fight more directly when the time comes. There’s also a pair of free <em>boots
of levitation</em> in it for the party.</p>

<p>The procedure for tracking down the murderer is laid down in detail: <em>speak with
dead</em> to interrogate the latest victim, and several skill checks to interpret
the provided clues. Getting too many of these wrong is a serious concern here,
since it will mostly shut down the investigation. The book suggests having the
Slasher try to kill a friendly NPC after a few days if this happens, and have
the victim escape to provide any missing details to the group. I suggest simply
providing those details during the initial investigation to avoid killing the
group’s momentum.</p>

<p>From a description of the suspect’s appearance, attire and the smell of a
specific kind of grease that hangs about him, the book says it’s possible to
deduce he’s a tinkerer who rents a shop at a sort of co-working space for
cog-mongers called Vespam Artisans. The place’s owner is fairly sympathetic to
the Ravens and will promptly reveal the suspect’s name (Varl Wex) and where he
lives.</p>

<p>Wex has a room at a tenement house. Depending on how the PCs handled the
investigation up to this point, he will be either away from home when they
arrive or waiting in ambush.</p>

<p>The story here is that Wex came across a sentient magic kukri used by the
original Slasher, and was brainwashed by the weapon into becoming a serial
killer himself. The weapon in question and a whole lot of other incriminating
evidence are hidden in a secret room in the apartment. If Wex is out, he will
arrive during the investigation and either try to bluff his way to the
hidey-hole to retrieve the weapon, or attack at once if the PCs already found
it. If he’s lying in ambush, he will strike from the secret room and try to pick
off the PCs one at a time until he’s found out. Wex will fight to the death,
though he might retreat to set up sneak attacks.</p>

<p>Eliminating Wex is already a service to the city at large and will get the Rose
of Kintargo on the PC’s side. They also have several options on how to dispose
of the body and evidence! The most interesting one is to turn them over to the
authorities, which will immensely bolster the Ravens’ reputation and force
Barzilai to publicly thank the PCs for their service to preserve
appearances. They can also turn them over to a neutral party who will get the
credit for the deed if they don’t want the exposure, but hey, go big or go home!</p>

<p>Similarly, they can hand the evil knife to one of the remaining legal “good”
temples in Kintargo and get a reward equal to its monetary value, or turn it
over to a sensible neutral party like Tiora and get half that value. Either of
these will get the artifact safely destroyed. Any other solutions carry the risk
that the weapon will make its way back to the murder cult who originally created
it, and cause future trouble for the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="conversion-notes">Conversion Notes</h3>

<p>Wex is statted up as a level 10 fighter/rogue, built to stack bleed effects on
his targets, which benefit from the effects of his evil weapon (see below). A
GURPS conversion should probably start from the Assassin or Thief templates,
with around 50-75 extra points spent on making him deadly with a kukri: Weapon
Master (Knives), higher ST, higher skill, and Targeted Attacks to the neck or
femoral arteries if your campaign uses that level of detail.</p>

<p>The evil kukri is named Balgorrah, and contains the soul of a murder cult
priest. It causes greater than normal bleeding and gives the wielder temporary
HP equal to the amount of bleeding it caused. It also tries to compel the
wielder to become a serial killer.</p>

<p>The GURPS version should be Fine, Balanced and Ornate (+1), and enchanted with
Weaken Blood and Steal Vitality. It should also have an IQ score and an Energy
Reserve which it can use to power its own enchantments.</p>

<h2 id="analysis-and-review">Analysis and Review</h2>

<p>Part 2 ends right after describing the three missions above. The only mission
that’s really required for moving the plot forward is Mission 1, but Mission 2
rewards the PCs with such a valuable strategic resource that I would strongly
consider replacing Captain Sargaeta with a more obviously sympathetic NPC if
your group would be disinclined to trust him as written.</p>

<p>Mission 3 seems to be mostly there as filler to give the PCs enough XP to hit
level 6 in time for the adventure’s finale, but it’s interesting enough on its
own merits that I would still keep it in my version of the adventure.</p>

<p>Our next article will look at Part 3, which ends this adventure with a big
dungeon raid.</p>

<p>I’ve recently published a three-post miniseries adapting the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/09/28/elder-scrolls-humans.html">humans</a>,
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/04/elder-scrolls-elves.html">elves</a>, and <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html">other interesting folks</a> from the Elder Scrolls series of
computer games to GURPS. Now I want to talk a bit about how I did it!</p>

<p>These three posts, and the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/09/03/one-post-skyrim.html">One-Post Skyrim</a> adaptation that preceded them,
were the first time in a while where I was able to fully exercise the approach
to adapting video games that I outlined as one of the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/28/adapting-video-games.html">very first articles on
this blog</a>. And the mini-series in particular was where I tried some new
things, and I feel it’s worth talking about these things.</p>

<h2 id="researching-the-source-material">Researching the Source Material</h2>

<p>Everything I said way back when in <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/28/adapting-video-games.html">Adapting Videogames</a> still reflects the
way I think about this process. Fiction takes precedence over original
mechanics, and I get to pick and choose from both in case they contradict
themselves.</p>

<p>For One-Post Skyrim I had just the one game to look at, but for Peoples of
Tamriel I needed to cast a wider net. Elder Scrolls is a sprawling,
decade-spanning franchise, where these contradictions are bound to come up a lot
more often. So how did I deal with it?</p>

<p>My “original sources” here were all the <em>mainline</em> games of the Elder Scrolls
franchise, as described by the <a href="http://uesp.net">Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages</a>
wiki<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. That’s still a huge amount of data, and it’s positively filled with
all those contradictions I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Most of them are mechanics-based. Basically, each game in the series differs as
much from its predecessor as, say, D&amp;D 3.0 is from AD&amp;D, <em>at a minimum</em>. I
decided to narrow the field down a little by looking at what changed and what
remained constant between games. Things that changed every game were obviously
less important to replicating its “feel” than things that stayed the same.</p>

<p>The big invariant here is the core gameplay loop: in every game, you wander and
explore the world. You are given quests by NPCs, or discover them through other
means. You enter dungeons, fight the enemies inside, and loot their
treasure. There is a “main quest”, but you can choose to ignore it in favor of
faffing about doing sidequests or simply raiding dungeons as you come across
them.</p>

<p>You might remember I wrote pretty much the exact same thing during One-Post
Skyrim. That’s because these things remain as true in Skyrim as they were in
Arena<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. All of it is very “high level” stuff, and does not require any
specific tabletop mechanics to replicate, which is awesome for me. But how about
the specific mechanical details? When it comes to playable character origins,
the list of invariants is surprisingly small: you can choose from
several. That’s it! The exact composition of the list and what each origin’s
traits are changes significantly from game to game.</p>

<h2 id="adapting-the-peoples-of-tamriel">Adapting the Peoples of Tamriel</h2>

<p>In the end I opted to use the list from Skyrim, which is both the most complete
and the most popular of the franchise (it’s also used by Oblivion and
Online). And when statting them up, I did two things: I avoided using the word
“race” as much as possible, and I didn’t give them any attribute adjustments or
mandatory mental disadvantages. This has the benefit of making these templates
feel very “Skyrim”-like, since that’s also the way Skyrim does things. But there
were other reasons why I chose this approach.</p>

<p>There’s an article out there that says it much better than I can, but
unfortunately I’ve lost the link to it. Basically, the way racial attribute
adjustment works in systems like D&amp;D reinforces character stereotypes in a way
that could be considered racist if it was applied to real-world people. Calling
these bits of character creation <em>races</em> doesn’t help either, since that word
has a lot of baggage from the real world.</p>

<p>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy doesn’t suffer from this to the same extent with attribute
adjustments, since the cost of a racial template is small compared to the
player’s total point budget. It does however, kinda fall prey to it when it
comes to racial advantages and disadvantages. The bigot who says “all cat-folk
are lazy spazzes”, or “all dwarves are hard-headed greedy bastards” ends up
kinda having a point when those traits are a mandatory part of their templates.</p>

<p>I didn’t really want to play in a setting where bigots have a point, even about
entirely fictional populations. I’m pretty satisfied with the final result: all
the templates felt flavorful, and their traits didn’t force players to pick a
particular profession over another as much. Players who want to hew closer to
the cultural stereotypes about a given people could pick from the list of
optional “Other Traits”, and could even pick optional traits listed under a
different template for extra variety.</p>

<p>This worked out fairly well in my case because all the different people of
Tamriel have roughly the same shape and size. GURPS is a system that places a
lot of value on realism, so I imagine I would still need to keep <em>some</em> physical
attribute adjutments in there if I were to include pixies and half-giants in the
lineup. However, in systems or campaigns where that matters less even those
wouldn’t need adjustments. I plan on keeping this approach with any other such
templates I make.</p>
