<p>This is the second post in a series about the bringing peoples of Tamriel to a
GURPS fantasy game. This post deals with elves, just as <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2018/09/28/elder-scrolls-humans.html">the first one</a> dealt
with humans.</p>

<h2 id="elves-in-tamriel">Elves in Tamriel</h2>

<p>As it happens in most fantasy settings, the Elves of Tamriel<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> are a bit
taller than its humans on average, and have large almond-shaped eyes and pointy
ears. They’re also more inherently magical than humans, though that extra magic
tends to conform itself to the environment a given elven people occupies over
time.</p>

<p>Like humans, each elven people is associated with a different region of Tamriel,
briefly described in their template. Each template also includes “typical”
cultural traits and adventuring professions for a native of that region, which
could apply to anyone born there.</p>

<p>Most elven people live much longer than humans, but in a typical Dungeon Fantasy
campaign that’s not worth any points<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="altmer-25-points">Altmer (25 Points)</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-High_Elf_Male_1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>High Elves in all settings tend to have a reputation as snobs, and these guys
are no exception. Altmer are on average taller than humans, with golden skin and
white or golden hair. Their eyes are usually gold, amber or green in color.</p>

<p>Altmer are the <em>original</em> elves, at least according to their own traditions. All
the other elven peoples originated from groups of Altmer dissidents who left
their homeland of Summerset Isle and migrated elsewhere. While individual High
Elves vary a lot in their outlook, the highly stratified society of Summerset
Island is founded on the idea that they’re better than everyone else.</p>

<p>Altmer religion teaches they are the direct descendants of gods who were tricked
into giving up their divinity so the world could be created. They ruled a
continent-spanning empire in Tamriel long before humans arrived on the scene,
and the islands don’t lack for extremists who want to bring the good old days
back at the expense of everyone else. The latest of these are the fascist
Thalmor, who by the events of Skyrim are alarmingly close to conquering Tamriel.</p>

<p>The younger generations tend to be much more egalitarian and open-minded, as do
Altmer of all ages who live outside of Summerset. Their innate facility with
magic and the wide availability of quality training in Summerset means Altmer
adventurers are commonly Wizards or members of other spellcasting professions
(like, say, <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/19/characters-magic-archer.html">Magic Archers</a>). Even High Elves who are nominally knights or
swashbucklers know a few spells.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Magery 1 {15}; Energy Reserve (Magical) 3 {9}; Better Power
Items {1}.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Some level of Intolerance is extremely common among Thalmor
members, and even those Altmer who oppose their ideology might still be prone to
bouts of well-meaning condescension that translate into an Odious Personal
Habit.</p>

<h3 id="bosmer-25-points">Bosmer (25 points)</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Wood_Elf_Male_2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Bosmer or Wood Elves call the temperate, heavily-forested province of Valenwood
their home. Their appearance and behavior are pretty much those of cliche wood
elves from other settings: they’re all about archery and protecting their forest
homes.</p>

<p>Many Valenwood Bosmer go even beyond the cliche by becoming members of the Green
Pact, a religious philosophy that exhorts them to avoid harming plants and
natural environments, never take the shape of beasts, and never kill
wastefully. Green Pact followers are strict carnivores who feel morally
obligated to eat or otherwise make use everything they kill - for the most
extreme among them, that includes <em>people</em>. They can’t make any objects from
plant matter, but can use those made by others just fine.</p>

<p>Scouts and Druids are by far the most popular professions for Bosmer
adventurers.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Animal Empathy {5}; Animal Friend {5}; Forest Guardian 2 {10};
Resistant to Poison +3 {5}.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Disciplines of Faith (Green Pact) is worth -15 points and is
common in Valendood proper. Green Pact extremists also have Odious Personal
Habit (Cannibal) for another -15 points and a -3 to reactions from anyone who is
not similarly inclined. This should probably be restricted to NPCs. Bosmer PCs
might also opt to take plain old Sense of Duty (Nature) instead or not take any
of these disadvantages at all, particularly if they were raised outside of
Valenwood.</p>

<h3 id="dunmer-20-points">Dunmer (20 points)</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Dark_Elf_Male_2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Dunmer, also known as Dark Elves, have ash-colored skin, black, dark brown or
white hair, and red or amber eyes. They hail from the volcanic land of
Morrowind, which they share with giant mushrooms, giant insects, and a whole lot
of ash. They are widely known as fierce warriors and aggressive spellcasters,
shaped by their harsh environment and cutthroat politics.</p>

<p>Morrowind is dominated by four noble houses who divide the important functions
of society among themselves. Needless to say, they constantly scheme against
each other: this is a realm whose premier law enforcement agency is a guild of
assassins. They spent much of their history worshipping a pantheon that was
basically an ascended adventuring party. After the events of <strong>Morrowind</strong> they
mostly revert back to their old gods. In both cases ancestor worship remains an
important component of their religion.</p>

<p>Dunmer adventurers tend to be Knights and Wizards, or professions that combine
both (like the Mystic Knights from Pyramid #3/13). Thieves and Assassins (or
even Ninja!) are also common. Your typical Dunmer wizard tends to prefer
elements other than fire for their damage spells, since they expect to be
slinging those at other Dunmer in the course of their many violent
intrigues. Their tradition of ancestor worship means necromancy is looked upon a
lot more favorably in Morrowind than it is elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Damage Resistance (Limited, Heat/Fire -40%) 5 {15}; Magery 0
{5}.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Getting your PCs tangled in Dunmer House politics is an
excellent way to introduce all sorts of social traits like Enemies, Allies,
Secrets, Patrons and Contacts in a game that didn’t include them previously.</p>

<h3 id="orsimer-21-points">Orsimer (21 points)</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Orc_Male_1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>In Tamriel, Orcs are Elves too! They were almost universally reviled for a long
time, but their loyal service to the Empire over the years earned them
acceptance. They look big, green, and tusky, and unlike other Mer live about as
long as humans.</p>

<p>The orcish homeland isn’t an official province, but rather a series of mountain
ranges that falls within High Rock, Skyrim and Valenwood. Their capital is the
city of Orsinium, which has been sacked and rebuilt multiple times in different
locations throughout the history of Tamriel. Traditional orcish culture makes
Nords seem like peace-loving softies. They basically worship the God of Having A
Chip on Your Shoulder.</p>

<p>Orcish adventurers favor big, brawny professions like Knight and Barbarian,
though orcish Artificers are also surprisingly common and tend to specialize
either in smithing or in alchemy.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Focused Fury {1}; Great Rage 1 {20}.</p>

<p><strong>Other Traits</strong>: Both advantages above are from Dungeon Fantasy Denizens:
Barbarians. If the campaign takes place in a time or place where orcs are
particularly reviled, they would also have an appropriate Social Stigma. Like
Nords, though, orcish Barbarians in campaigns taking place in their homeland
aren’t considered a Minority Group. Some level of Berserk is quite common,
though.</p>

<h3 id="other-elves">Other Elves</h3>

<p>The templates above are just for the elves that have been traditionally playable
in Elder Scrolls games. There are many, many more:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In Tamriel, dwarves are elves! The Dwemer vanished way back in the First Age
and left a whole bunch of extensive, steam-powered underground complexes whose
advanced machinery is <em>still</em> pumping after all these millenia.</li>
  <li>The Falmer, or Snow Elves, dominated Skyrim at the dawn of the First Age and
were displaced by the conquering Nords. This led to an ill-fated deal with the
Dwemer that eventually turned most of them into blind cave-dwelling cannibals.</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual for Dungeon Fantasy, every time your PCs think they know all elven
subtypes, feel free to introduce a couple more.</p>

<p>It appears someone finally took me up on my offer to write a more detailed post
on any aspects of my <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2-18/09/03/one-post-skyrim.html">One-Post Skyrim</a> adaptation. The requested topic were
racial templates, so this is what I’m going to write about it here.</p>

<p>Scholars in Tamriel tend to divide its peoples into three main classifications:
“Men”, “Mer” and “Beast Folk”. This pretty much means Humans, Elves, and
Everyone Else, and as usual for this kind of medieval-ish scholarship is as much
a political construct as a biological one. This post deals with humans.</p>

<p>My primary source for this article are the wonderful <a href="http://uesp.net">Unofficial Elder Scrolls
Pages</a>, which have detailed descriptions of the lore and mechanics for all
games in the franchise<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="humans-in-tamriel">Humans in Tamriel</h2>

<p>Humans, being humans, don’t have any “mandatory” traits and as such their
“templates” technically cost 0 points. Each of the human peoples described here
is associated with a specific region of Tamriel where it makes up the majority
of the population, so their descriptions also include a bit of info on those
provinces and a small list of traits considered typical for their culture and
common adventuring professions.</p>

<p>It’s entirely possible for a human character to not have any of their culture’s
“stereotypical” traits, or to have an entirely different set more in line with
the region they actually grew up in. And the list of common adventuring
professions in no way restricts the professions a character may choose from. If
you want to be a Nord Wizard or a Breton Ninja, go for it!</p>

<h3 id="bretons">Bretons</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Breton_Female_2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Bretons are humans native from the province of High Rock, the region of Tamriel
that most resembles your typical Arthurian pastiche. They are commonly
fair-skinned, with hair that ranges from black to blond. Many demonstrate a
remarkable facility with (and resistance to) magic, which is alternatively
attributed to their ancient druidic traditions or to elven blood depending on
who’s doing the attribution.</p>

<p>The most common way for your average High Rock citizen to go up in life is to
impress a noble from its many squabbling fiefs by performing meritorious deeds.
High Rock is a big exporter of questing Knights and Holy Warriors, and of
spellcasters who take on Druidic trappings.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Magery and Magic Resistance (Improved) are extremely common among
the natives of High Rock.</p>

<h3 id="imperials">Imperials</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Imperial_Male_2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Imperials hail from the region of Cyrodiil, right in the middle of Tamriel. They
are called that because in most Elder Scrolls games their homeland is also the
seat of the Empire.</p>

<p>The Empire is the third political entity to bear this name in Tamriel’s
history. It’s a sophisticated, cosmopolitan society whose seat of power is
located in a majestic city and whose hegemony is ensured by a combination of
diplomacy, trade, and the military might of its infantry legions. In other
words, they are basically off-brand Romans.</p>

<p>Imperial adventurers who hail from the ranks of the legions are most often
Knights or battle Wizards. Other popular delver professions are Scholars,
Clerics and Bards. The “visiting wise man from Cyrodiil” looking for a lost
ruin is common enough to have become something of a cliche.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Imperials have a reputation for being well-spoken and
charismatic. They often have Charisma, Born War Leader, Business Acumen or
Smooth Operator, as well as points in the skills boosted by those talents.</p>

<h3 id="nords">Nords</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Nord_Female_1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Nords are our off-brand Vikings, as fond of song as they are of fighting. We
learned plenty about their homeland of Skyrim in my <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2-18/09/03/one-post-skyrim.html">last post</a>.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Skyrim have a greater distrust of magic than those of most
other provinces, and prefer facing their foes head-on. As such, Knight and
Barbarian are some of the most common adventurer professions for them. Bards are
also quite popular, both as entertainers and as keepers of history.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Nord barbarians from Skyrim <em>don’t</em> carry a Social Stigma in
campaigns that take place there, and should replace that with 10 points in other
disadvantages. Intolerance (Magic Users) or Compulsive Carousing fit the
stereotype. Some level of Temperature Tolerance (Cold) isn’t out of place in
even the most “urban” Nord.</p>

<h3 id="redguards">Redguards</h3>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="/octopus-carnival/assets/LG-avatar-Redguard_Male_1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Redguards are tall, well-built humans with dark skin and curly black or red
hair. They landed in the arid province of Hammerfell, and made if their home
over the centuries. Their culture seems to take inspiration from many different
African sources, but ends up looking mostly Moorish, at least superficially.</p>

<p>Redguards are know as the most talented warriors in Tamriel, which is saying a
lot given the continent also has Orcs and Nords in it. They make better
skirmishers and independent agents than rank and file troops, and during most of
the games have a long history of loyal service to the imperial line of Tiber
Septim.</p>

<p>Redguard adventurers most often belong to the fightier
professions. Swashbucklers and Scouts are the most common, with Martial Artists
and Knights following close behind.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: The most iconic Redguard trait is Combat Reflexes! Redguards also
prize skill with the sword, so even less martial Redguard adventurers are likely
to have some training in that area.</p>

<h3 id="other-humans">Other Humans</h3>

<p>These four human origins are just the ones that are playable in most of the
Elder Scrolls games. Several others are mentioned but not traditionally
playable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Nedes had a large civilization in the time before the First Age of
Tamriel, which entered into decline and was eventually absorbed by several
other of the playable cultures.</li>
  <li>The silver-skinned Kothringi of Black Marsh are said to have died out from the
Khanaten Flu in the middle Second Age.</li>
  <li>The neighboring continent of Akavir is home to a large human civilization who
once successfully invaded and conquered Tamriel, starting its Second Age. In
keeping witht he “swipe from real world cultures” theme, the Akaviri are
off-brand Imperial Japanese.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tabletop games set far enough into the past could certainly allow for Nede or
Kothringi PCs, and Akaviri PCs would be plausible at almost any time.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing a lot of Skyrim lately, and it occurred to me that adapting
that to GURPS could be a fun project. So I’m going to do that in this post.</p>

<p>And when I say “in this post”, I mean that literally! I do not intend to spend
the next three years writing about this like I did with my Dragon’s Dogma
project. This means I’m going to cheat like a cheating cheater and take
shortcuts. Whenever I can get away with giving page references to published
books or links to other articles, I will do so. The result should still resemble
the thing I’m trying to adapt, and those who disagree with that can still use
the post as “Iteration One” in their own more elaborate efforts.</p>

<h2 id="themes-and-gameplay">Themes and Gameplay</h2>

<p>Before we can start messing about with rules we have to take a look at our
source material, which in this case is the <strong>Skyrim</strong> computer game (written in
bold from now on to differentiate it from the Skyrim region). <strong>Skyrim</strong> is
just one part of the extensive Elder Scrolls franchise, but I’m going to
restrict myself to just the one game as source material. Consider it my first
cheat.</p>

<p>If I were to describe <strong>Skyrim</strong> in one sentence, I’d call it the video-game
version of a sandbox campaign with a heavy power fantasy element.</p>

<p>How <strong>Skyrim</strong> a sandbox campaign? It has pretty much the exact same core
gameplay loop. You create a character to your liking and wander around a large
region peppered with dungeons and other interesting places to visit. You add to
your to-do list by talking to NPCs and receiving quests from them, or by
overhearing and reading rumors which point you to particular dungeons. While
wandering around the map you also periodically run into random
encounters. There’s technically a “main quest”, but the game doesn’t pressure
you into completing it any more than it does any other quest, and completing it
doesn’t end the game.</p>

<p>How does <strong>Skyrim</strong> give you a power fantasy? Through the rules, by using a
skill-based system that gives every player character access to every skill in
the game. And through the story, by allowing PCs to play through multiple
quest-lines that would usually <em>each</em> take up a whole character’s career. Not
only can you become a legendary fighter, mage <em>and</em> thief, you can also become
the head honcho of the Fighters’, Mages’, <em>and</em> Thieves’ Guilds. It also doesn’t
make you wait until you’re “powerful enough” to give you access to its more
“epic” storylines: you kill your first dragon quite early in the main quest,
interact with several deities starting not long after, take on (or <em>join</em>) a
cabal of millenia-old vampires who want to blot out the sun, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="choice-of-system">Choice of System</h3>

<p>So how are we going to adapt this for the tabletop? We want something whose
“feel” approaches the one I described above for the original game. I’m going to
use GURPS Dungeon Fantasy because of course I will, but there are good reasons
for choosing it aside from my fanboyism.</p>

<p>I believe GURPS is particularly well-suited here because it allows for
considerable flexibility in character creation. Dungeon Fantasy with its
insistence in sticking to templates is a little less flexible, but that
restriction is easy to relax and we’ll be doing so here.</p>

<p>Other advantages of Dungeon Fantasy: its 250-point starting heroes allow players
to feel powerful and take on “epic” challenges right away, and it has ready-made
mechanics for most of the situations routinely encountered by <strong>Skyrim</strong>
players.</p>

<p>Also of note are the things that will be different from the computer game: it
will be aimed at a whole party of PCs instead of a lone hero and it will use the
standard pace of DF character advancement.</p>

<p>The place we’re concerned about is Skyrim! This is the “frozen north” of the
continent of Tamriel, a roughly rectangular region bounded by mountain chains to
the south, east and west and by the Sea of Ghosts to the north.</p>

<p>In-game Skyrim is around 40 square kilometers in size, but that’s obviously
because it’s highly “truncated” as is usual for this type of game. There’s no
published official size, though it appears someone has managed to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/ui64h/tamriels_size_in_square_miles/">extract a
halfway plausible measurement</a> over on Reddit that indicates Skyrim would be
about the size of Poland. That means its linear measurements would need to be in
the order of <em>100 times</em> larger than their in-game size: about 500km tall and
600km wide<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. That’s quite large! It would take weeks to hike from one end of
Skyrim to the other, and that’s ignoring things like monster or bandit attacks.</p>

<p>The climate near the southern border is on the cold end of temperate. As you go
north, both elevation and average temperature drop. Grasslands and temperate
forests give way to conifers and frozen marshes, then tundra and fjords on the
northern coast. The topography is quite “wrinkly”, with several minor mountain
ranges dotting the interior of the province. There are two river systems, one to
the southeast and another to the northwest, both flowing north to the sea.</p>

<p>Politically, the region is divided into nine holds, which you can see in the
above map. Skyrim is officially a province of the Cyrodillic Empire, having
joined it in the distant past through alliance rather than conquest. The
Imperials are basically off-brand Romans, and you could explain any significant
departures from the Viking cultural baseline through this centuries-long
association.</p>

<p>Settlement distribution follows the same model as the one I described for
<a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/03/how-big-is-this-place.html">Gransys</a>, and since the in-game map isn’t as aggressively minimalist as that
of Dragon’s Dogma you can have a better idea of where they would be. Hold
capitals are usually major cities, and the other settlements that appear in the
game would mostly count as “towns”. Villages, as usual, are everywhere, though I
guess Whiterun with its fertile plains has a lot more of them than The
Pale. Towns and cities are linked by a fairly good, though winding, road
network.</p>

<h2 id="people">People</h2>

<p>Though Skyrim is the home of the Nords, all of Tamriel’s peoples find themselves
represented here one way or the other. Players should be able to create
characters belonging to any of them. Since all of them will live in Skyrim and
be part of its society, that’s where we will focus our attention.</p>

<p>Nords are basically off-brand Vikings. Hall of Judgment and Dragon Heresy
contain great descriptions of a fantasy Viking culture that would be an
excellent starting base for Skyrim’s Nords. The main differences are that there
are no thralls in Skyrim, and the Nords follow the setting-specific Nine Divines
instead of the Aesir. Jarls and Karls work as in HoJ/DH, but Thane is a formal
position granted by a Jarl to people who have done a great service to the
kingdom, roughly equivalent to a knighthood in importance. Thanes are expected
to continue performing the services that gained them the title in the first
place, but don’t much else in the way of formal obligations.</p>

<p>Law and order is a bit more formal in Skyrim than in the other settings I
mentioned, possibly because of Imperial influence. Each hold keeps a permanent
contingent of guards responsible both for repelling external attacks and for
keeping the peace internally. Criminals must still pay a bounty commensurate
with their crimes, but that bounty is paid to the <em>hold</em>, which presumably then
sees that the wronged party is properly compensated. Those who can’t pay their
own bounty usually end up rotting in jail for a commensurate amount of time. A
Thane who gets caught committing a crime might be able to use their station to
escape punishment, but this too has its limits. Commit enough crimes and the
Jarl declare you an outlaw and start offering a bounty on your head: that’s how
bandit gangs are born.</p>

<h3 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h3>

<p>Starting characters are built on 250 points, and are assumed to be somewhat
experienced adventurers already. Players may use any DF professional template
they wish, but are explicitly <em>not</em> restricted to only the traits in their
chosen template during character creation or advancement. Completely freeform
character creation is also allowed. I’m aware this might open up some
unexpectedly powerful combinations - adjudicating those is left as an exercise
to the GM.</p>

<p>Racial templates are easy:</p>

<p><strong>Nords</strong>, <strong>Bretons</strong>, <strong>Imperials</strong> and <strong>Redguards</strong> are all human.</p>

<p><strong>Skyrim</strong> also has a whole lot of elves, but so does DF, and they map almost
directly to one another! <strong>Altmer</strong> are High Elves, <strong>Bosmer</strong> are Wood Elves,
<strong>Dunmer</strong> are Shadow Elves. <strong>Orcs</strong> are technically elves in Tamriel, and are
best represented by the Half-Orc template. Even <strong>Dwarves</strong> are a kind of elf in
this setting, but there are none left alive.</p>

<p><strong>Khajit</strong> are obviously Catfolk, and Dragon-blooded make passable <strong>Argonians</strong>
if you replace the fiery breath and Reputation with Doesn’t Breathe (Gills,
-50%).</p>

<p>Further tweaking of all of these is not only possible but advisable, and is left
as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>Magic works differently than standard Dungeon Fantasy. Skyrim is effectively an
<a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2017/08/30/agnostic-dungeon-fantasy.html">agnostic Dungeon Fantasy</a> setting that takes the Simple Option for spells
and the Cool Option for non-spell powers. Even characters who start off without
any Magery may buy it with earned character points. Any enemy group with more
than a handful of members is likely to contain one or more spellcasters, and
many people know a useful spell or two even if they don’t call themselves
wizards.</p>

<h3 id="the-voice">The Voice</h3>

<p>The Voice should be modeled as a form of Sorcery, should a GM with to include
it. Each Shout is a separate power that comes in three levels, corresponding to
the number of words known or utilized. Students of the Voice rarely learn more
than one or two Shouts, buying them directly and paying the full cost. Knowing
even one makes you quite a bit more dangerous than you would be in the computer
game, since there are no cooldowns in the default Sorcery rules!</p>

<p>And since I know you’re going to ask: no amount of Unusual Background can make
someone Dragonborn. This is a trait best assigned by a GM who wishes to make it
the focus of the campaign. The in-game effect is that you get a chunk of points
to spend on the Voice every time you kill a dragon, and can use them to buy
Talent or Sorcerous Empowerment for Voice powers.</p>

<p>Creating specific Shouts is left as an exercise for the GM, but here’s an
example:</p>

<h4 id="unrelenting-force-fus-ro-dah">Unrelenting Force (Fus-Ro-Dah)</h4>

<ul>
  <li><em>Keywords</em>: Obvious</li>
  <li><em>Full Cost</em>: 15/30/45</li>
  <li><em>Casting Roll</em>: None. Use Innate Attack (Breath) to hit.</li>
  <li><em>Range</em>: 20m</li>
  <li><em>Duration</em> Instantaneous.</li>
</ul>

<p>Projects a cone of force in front of the user that pushes everything in its path
away. The force doesn’t damage its targets directly, but can throw them great
distances and will definitely hurt if it knocks someone into a wall or over a
ledge.</p>

<p>Does 2d, 4d or 6d crushing damage with the No Wounding and Double Knockback
modifiers, out to a range of 20 meters. The cone is 3m wide at maximum
range. Diffuse targets take full damage!</p>

<p><em>Traits</em>: Crushing Attack 2, 4 or 6 with (Cone, 3m, +80%; Double Knockback +20%;
Variable + 5%; Blockable -5%; Reduced Max 1/5, -10%; No Wounding except versus
Diffuse targets -25%; Sorcery -15%;)</p>

<h2 id="stuff">Stuff</h2>

<p>For the most part, you should be fine using the default equipment list for
either version of Dungeon Fantasy. Applying the modifiers described in Hall of
Judgment on top of that will get you something that’s a lot more Nord-flavored.</p>

<p>The computer game made a big deal of organizing weapons and armor in tiers that
used different materials, but those can be replaced with the special DF
materials and modifiers without losing much of anything - particularly if you
have DF 8: Treasure Tables or DF Treasures 1: Glittering Prizes, which have a
list of “impossible materials” that work as supernatural embelishments to
weapons and include several familiar names (glass, ebony…).</p>

<h2 id="adventures">Adventures</h2>

<p>Skyrim is lousy with ancient Nord burial mounds and tomb-complexes, each filled
with traps, treasure, and lots of draugr who will be very angry when they see
you taking their stuff. If grave-robbing is not your thing, you can hunt down
bandits or murderous fauna for bounties, enter the service of an organization
such as the Companions or the College of Winterhold<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, or try to talk a
Daedric lord or twelve into revealing where their pet artifacts are located.</p>

<p><strong>Skyrim</strong>’s story takes place during a time when the Empire is in decline due
to a prolonged conflict with the Aldmeri Dominion and the fascist Thalmor that
govern it. Most of its other provinces have either been conquered by the
Dominion or seceded when the Empire signed a peace treaty with the Thalmor that
made several heavy concessions. There’s an ugly civil war going on in Skyrim
between the Imperial legions and a rebel faction who call themselves the
Stormcloaks and seek to secede from the Empire as well. The Thalmor play one
against the other from the shadows. Taking part in the civil war could make for
an interesting campaign, but it’s also perfectly possible to play during a more
peaceful time either before or after the game’s story.</p>

<p>No matter where you wish to go, simply getting there is an adventure in
itself. Using the wilderness survival rules from DF 16 or Hall of Judgment is
strongly encouraged. If you’re playing in the same time frame as the computer
game, make sure to include dragons in your wandering monster tables<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Hall of Judgment</strong> is a particularly notable adventure for the <strong>Dungeon
Fantasy RPG</strong>, because it’s published not by Steve Jackson Games but by Gaming
Ballistic LLC. It’s not only the first licensed DFRPG book, it’s also the first
licensed GURPS book I’ve ever heard of.</p>

<p>It was published fairly recently as of this writing, after a successful
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2101297466/hall-of-judgment-a-dungeon-fantasy-rpg-supplement">kickstarter campaign</a>. I backed it pretty early on, and now I have a copy of
the final <strong>Hall of Judgment</strong> PDF in my screen. So let’s review it!</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

<p>If you already have the DFRPG boxed set and are looking for supplements to add
to your game, this should be at the very top of your shopping list. It contains
a Viking-flavored mini-setting with plenty of cultural notes; four separate
dungeons; a set of rules for wilderness travel; the GURPS version of the Dungeon
Grappling rules; approximately 30 new monsters; and 16 setting-appropriate
pre-made player characters.</p>

<p>If you also have the Dragon Heresy intro set and wanted to play in that setting
using GURPS rules, then this book should get you most of the way there.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-book-itself">On the Book Itself</h2>

<p><strong>Hall of Judgment</strong> is a 132-page book describing all of the stuff I mentioned
in the TL; DR section. I backed this at the PDF level, so this is what I
have. The physical book will be softcover and produced via Print-on-Demand - it
seems the campaign didn’t quite reach the stretch goal for fancier printing
options.</p>

<p>The layout is a bit similar to that of the Dragon Heresy intro-set, but it feels
“GURPSier”, as it should. The font is a bit different, the columns are closer
together and the ornamentation around the edges of the pages is different. It
all still feels pretty Vigking-ish. <strong>Hall of Judgement</strong> also reuses several
pieces of art from the DH intro set, which is fine by me as they also fit well
here.</p>

<p>The writing is reminiscent of plenty of other Dungeon Fantasy products, a style
I personally like. The setting descriptions are written in a way that makes it
more amenable to a full reading than quick reference, but the dungeons have a
clearly labeled section for each room, with labeled paragraphs describing the
challenges, rewards, alternative ways of dealing with the challenges, and
anything that might be initially concealed from the PCs. I’m sure the Ten Foot
Pole guy would think they’re still a little too verbose, though.</p>

<p>Along with the PDF I also got two zip files containing full-sized versions of
the encounter and dungeon maps present in the book. The encounter maps have no
grid, which means they’re suitable for use in a virtual table-top program.</p>

<p>And once again, this book has a table of contents and index comparable to those
of a GURPS book, which is awesome.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-setting">On the Setting</h2>

<p>The mini-setting contained in this book consists of the city of Isfjall and its
surrounding region, which includes Lake Odin, a few other
named-but-not-described villages, and a large and dangerous wilderness
containing four separate dungeons. One of those is the titular Hall.</p>

<p>This is a <em>significant</em> expansion over this adventure’s initial incarnation as
<em>Lost Hall of Tyr</em> for D&amp;D 5th Edition, which from what I gather started with
the PCs arriving near the Hall already. The whole setting is really a slice of
Torengar, the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2018/06/18/dragon-heresy-review.html">Dragon Heresy</a> world, but in the KS campaign’s words it has
been “mildly de-Norsed” so as to be dropped into any Dungeon Fantasy campaign as
the generic “Frozen North” from which barbarian characters frequently hail.</p>

<p>Isfjall is described in great detail for a Dungeon Fantasy work, in which “Town”
is usually entirely abstract. You get a rundown of the town’s economy, a little
primer on local culture, social hiearchies, religion and law, and a list of
almost-weekly festivals covering the whole year. Reading this you get a real
sense of why people built a town <em>here</em>, where the money and food comes from,
and what their daily lives are like. You can set your adventure at any given day
in a year and know what the town will look like on that day, from the
information given here.</p>

<p>This plus a table of rumors and the hook for the main dungeon take up a little
under 20 pages.</p>

<p>I liked this section quite a lot. It’s a nice departure from the “village of
dirt farmers plagued by mysterious disappearances” that features in so many
D&amp;D-ish modules, and it’s easy enough to modify. You can add the serial numbers
back on by replacing a few names, if you want to play in Torengar or stop
pretending the local pantheon aren’t the Aesir. You can also take it in the
other direction and, say, turn this into the basis for a Skyrim adaptation.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-adventure">On the Adventure</h2>

<p>Right after the chapter on Isfjall is a chapter on “The Journey”, which has a
neat little set of wilderness travel rules. They won’t be news to people who
already own GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 16, but they’re an awesome addition for anyone
who only owns the boxed set. Each of the three sub-regions the PCs will need to
traverse to reach the Hall are given their own encounter table, which contains a
good mix of natural obstacles and non-hostile encounters in addition to hostile
monsters. There is also a weather table covering the whole year. If you want to
really challenge your party, have them set out to find the Hall in the middle of
winter.</p>

<p>All this wilderness traveling can lead to one of four different
dungeons. There’s a ruined fortress built atop a barrow that contains the
spirits of all its inhabitants, two different fae lairs and the Hall of Judgment
itself. At no point are your players forced to go to any of them - there’s a
strong hook pointing them towards the Hall, but the adventure doesn’t impose any
punishment on the PCs if they want to do something else first, or instead. There
are also other minor hook suggestions here for GMs who want to make up their own
adventures in the setting.</p>

<p>The ruined fortress and the Hall of Judgment feel suitably Nordic, and the PCs
are likely to visit the first in their search for the second. The two faerie
warrens are entirely optional deathraps that should be a blast to GM.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-new-material">On the New Material</h2>

<p>Aside from the town setting and dungeons, this book contains plenty of new
material that should be useful for other campaigns. I already mentioned the
wilderness travel rules - the generic portion of them takes up about two pages,
and the specific portion provides a good worked example of how to stat up a
region’s weather.</p>

<p>Then you have Fantastic Dungeon Grappling, which is basically the GURPS version
of Dungeon Grappling rules Mr. Cole wrote for several editions of D&amp;D, which in
turn are a simplified version of the Technical Grappling rules he originally
wrote as a GURPS. I posted <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2018/04/06/quick-and-dirty-technical-grappling.html">my own take</a> on a simplified Technical Grappling
a few months ago, but the rules from this book are better and I recommend using
them if you can. I’ve already used them to great effect in a game I’m GMing.</p>

<p>If grappling rules don’t ring your bell, the 30+ new monsters statted up here
should make up for that. Each gets a page, with description, DFRPG stats, and an
illustration. All of them show up somewhere in the adventure, though your PCs
aren’t expected to fight every last one. You get a mix of wild and domestic
animals, some humans, a few undead and demons, and a whole lot of faeries from
Norse mythology. Even the weakest of <em>those</em> are quite a bit scarier than you’d
expect from their appearance.</p>

<p>After the bestiary there’s a group of 16 ready-to-play PCs, most of which are
local to the region. Since the adventure is written for a group of 4 to 6, this
is more than enough to assemble a number of possible parties, which would make
this adventure a lot easier to pick up and play provided the GM knows the book.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I got this book by backing the Kickstarter campaign at the US$10 tier. It’s now
available on <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/products/dungeon-fantasy-hall-of-judgment">Warehouse 23</a> or <a href="https://gamingballistic.com/product/hall-of-judgment-dfrpg-pdf/">Gaming Ballistic</a> for US$12.50. In its 132
pages it contains an adventure, a setting, new rules, a bestiary and a pre-made
PC portfolio. Given that your typical Dungeon Fantasy supplement only does one
of these things, costs $8, and likely contains some of the same material that
was put into the DFRPG boxed set, this book should probably be at the top of
your shopping list if all you have is that boxed set.</p>

<p>Even if you’re a GURPS Dungeon Fantasy player, this is still excellent value for
the money, as the only redundant bit here would be the 2 pages of wilderness
travel rules, and that only if you already have DF 16.</p>

<p>The theme for this month in the secretive cabal of GURPS bloggers is “fire or
heat”, so I figured I would do something a bit different from my usual
dungeonnesque fare and adapt Melta weapons from Warhammer 40K to GURPS.</p>

<p>Hasn’t that been done already? Yep! Many times, often for the whole of 40K
rather than just one weapon, with results of varying quality. A quick search for
“gurps meltagun” brings in this <a href="http://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?t=67296">this thread in the SJ Games forums</a> as the
top result, and there are a whole lotta others below that. My only excuse for
doing this is the Full Metal Jacket adage: “There are many like it, but this one
is mine.”</p>

<h2 id="meltaguns">Meltaguns</h2>

<p>These bulky weapons fire short-ranged beams of concentrated heat with an effect
similar to the blast of a shaped charge. They use canisters of highly compressed
exotic gasses as ammo, which account for about a third of their considerable
weight. There is pretty much no reason to use one of these instead of a good
anti-vehicle missile, but the Imperium of Man never cared for reason.</p>

<p>A meltagun can punch through most personal and vehicular armor and cause
grievous harm to the soft bits behind it. If you miss, though, your target will
be in a prime position to shoot back or charge at you<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Melta weapons come in several varieties:</p>

<p><strong>Inferno Pistols</strong> can (barely) be fired with one hand, using Beam Weapons
(Pistol). Their effective range is a bit shorter than that of your typical video
game shotgun, which is quite a feat.</p>

<p>Standard <strong>Meltaguns</strong> are fired using Beam Weapons (Rifle). They do the same
damage as inferno pistols, but have greater range and more shots per
canister.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-meltas</strong>, as the name implies, basically consist of several meltagun
assemblies bolted together. The resulting weapon is huge and heavy, with a heat
so intense it produces a 3d burn “backblast” that affects the shooter
and anyone standing up to 2 meters behind them. For these reasons it’s usually
either carried by large people in powered armor, mounted on vehicles, or
attached to shielded tripods. In the first case it’s fired with Beam Weapons
(Rifle); in the others with Gunner (Beams).</p>

<p>All melta weapons halve their armor divisor past 1/2D, and are affected by
spaced, laminated or electromagnetic armor as if they were shaped charges.</p>

<h2 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h2>

<p>Like Perfect Organism did over on <a href="http://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?t=67296">his forum thread</a>, I started by looking
through Ultra-Tech in search of already existing weapons that would be similar
to Warhammer 40K’s melta weapons. The plasma flamers on page 127 of that book
looked almost promising, but look both too weak and too slim to fit the bill.
The root of the problem is GURPS Ultra-Tech assumes a universe that makes sense,
even when describing superscience. But this is Warhammer 40K! Nothing makes
sense!</p>

<p>So in the end I took inspiration both from the plasma flamer stats in Ultra-Tech
and from the melta weapon stats in the Only War corebook. Then I pulled the
final numbers of out the Warp. The end result is even more insane and less
realistic than UT’s plasma flamers, but that’s what the superscience tag is for.</p>

<p><em>Pricing</em> these monstrosities is left as an exercise for the reader. If you’re
playing in the 40K setting or somewhere similar, cost doesn’t really matter,
since the people most likely to use these weapons will have them issued by their
bosses. In other settings they’re perfect as the inventions of a pyromaniac
mad scientist or the like. If they are available commercially, they should be
expensive, and in all of these cases their Legality Class is no better than 1.</p>
