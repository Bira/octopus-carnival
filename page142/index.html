            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this post I describe Gransys as a GURPS setting, as it is just before the
start of Dragon’s Dogma. Aside from
the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/03/how-big-is-this-place.html"><em>totally scientific</em> research</a> on its physical size, my
sources are the images and story from the original game, and the many scattered
bits of GURPS material on what a medieval fantasy setting should look
like. These include GURPS Fantasy, the various Low-Tech supplements, and a
couple of Pyramid articles. GURPS Adaptations provides the methodology.</p>

<p>As before, refer to <a href="http://dragonsdogma.wikia.com/wiki/File:Gransys_map_large_w_labels.jpg">the map</a> over at the Dragon’s Dogma Wikia when
necessary. Please note that I made up several of the details below for this
article, so if you find something from the original game or a secondary source
that seems to contradict this description, that’s why.</p>

<h2 id="physical-geography">Physical Geography</h2>

<p>Gransys is a sovereign duchy in an unnamed fantasy world. It’s located in a
peninsula and bordered by several other nations, from which it is separated by
imposing mountain ranges and thick forests. These natural barriers and the sea
define its shape, which bears a vague resemblance to a capital J.</p>

<p>Its southern reaches are warm and relatively flat, with an almost Mediterranean
climate near the coast. They are separated from Central and North Gransys by a
mountain range. As we go north, we see a rise in elevation and a drop in
temperature: Central Gransys is hilly and temperate, with grassy plains and
deciduous forests. North Gransys starts as a large plateau and ends as a series
of windy mountain passes.</p>

<p>The duchy’s largest stretch of forest is the Witchwood in South Gransys. It’s
dense enough that little sunlight reaches its floor, and does contain a swamp in
its furthest depths, but it’s not wet enough to be considered a jungle. Other
notable forests include the Verda Woodlands also in South Gransys, and the
deciduous Cursewood in Central Gransys.</p>

<p>Despite having quite a bit of coastline, Gransys has few sandy beaches. Most of
those are in South Gransys, with the rest of the coasts being made up of
imposing cliffs.</p>

<p>Gransys’ non-monstrous fauna is similar to our Europe’s, including rabbits,
deer, boars, ravens and seagulls. Its <em>monstrous</em> fauna will be discussed in
future posts. Its river and sea waters have plenty of edible fish of all sizes,
though those sailing too far from the coast risk running afoul of sea monsters.</p>

<p>Appropriate Survival specialties for outdoorsy characters would be Plains,
Woodland and Mountains. Those who spend a lot of time in the deep Witchwood
would benefit from Survival (Swamp) as well.</p>

<p>Gransys has normal mana over the vast majority of its territory, as does the
rest of the world. Places where the local mana level varies, if they exist, are
small and isolated.</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p>Gransys’ average Tech Level is what you would expect from a Dungeon Fantasy
game, which means it’s 4 with a few important exceptions. There are no cannon or
firearms, though black powder <em>is</em> known and used in the making of grenades and
other explosives. There is no movable type: written knowledge is disseminated
using the TL 3 method of hand-copying. Literacy is common in Gran Soren and
among priests and nobles, less so among peasants.</p>

<p>The best armor available are elaborate plate harnesses. Shields are also common
even for heavily armored fighters. Though fencing weapons are known, they are
not popular in Gransys.</p>

<p>Unlike standard Dungeon Fantasy, medicine is at TL 4, and is further boosted by
the abundance of potent medical herbs in the duchy. Some of those have innate
magical properties.</p>

<p>Transportation is still at TL 3, with <em>naval</em> transporation barely reaching even
that. Land-based trade routes are preferred over sea-based ones, due to the
large risk posed by sea monsters.</p>

<p>Agriculture is also at TL 3. Gransys farmers grow wheat and harspud, a peculiar
redish tuber rich in nutrients. They also raise cattle. Coastal communities
trawl nearby waters for fish. In both cases, meat is often preserved by
drying. Other crops include fruit like grapes and apples, often used for making
wine and cider.</p>

<h2 id="government-and-society">Government and Society</h2>

<p>As a sovereign duchy, Gransys is ruled by a Duke who answers to no higher
political authority. He is surrounded by a court made up of nobles responsible
for smaller holdings within the duchy and by wealthy merchants who gain
influence from their commercial dealings with the nobles and the Duke himself.</p>

<p>The current ruler is Duke Edmun Dragonsbane, who was crowned fifty years ago
after defeating the Dragon. His legitimacy is entirely predicated on this feat,
as he was a common-born soldier at the time. Despite being at least 70 years
old, he’s still in excellent physical shape. He has Status 7.</p>

<p>There are two <em>counties</em> within Gransys, but they currently exist only on
paper. One covers much of South Gransys and used to be centered on Aernst
Castle, and the other covered the region around where Windbluff Tower now
sits. Their titles are held by Fedel, the Duke’s nephew, and Aldous, the Duke’s
chamberlain, and in practice serve to give them the authority to conduct the
Duke’s business on his behalf. They are status 5. Someone who received the title
of Count and managed to claim the corresponding land would be Status 6.</p>

<p>Those knights given a direct ducal mandate receive the title of <em>margrave</em>, and
this includes those in charge of the three <em>border marches</em> centered around the
Greatwall, Shadow Fort, and Windbluff Tower. These castles are meant to defend
Gransys from monster attack and foreign invasion, and by ducal decree are
supplied from the capital rather than from the surrounding lands. This serves
purposes both practical (the surrounding lands are inospitable) and political
(ensuring the soldier’s loyalty is to the Duke directly), but in practice causes
serious logistics and morale problems. They are Status 4.</p>

<p>There are many smaller <em>baronies</em> scattered throughout the kingdom and
administered from manor houses - most farming villages are technically part of
one such barony. The most influent among these barons usually spend their time
in the Duke’s court and leave a chamberlain to tend to their day-to-day
business. The Duke doesn’t usually concern himself with the affairs of barons as
long as they’re punctual with the tribute. They are Status 3.</p>

<p>Below them are <em>landless knights</em>, who usually serve as part of someone else’s
armed forces. Both male and female knights are called by the honorific
“Ser”. They are Status 2.</p>

<p>Skilled artisans and well-off citizens are Status 1, average urban denizens are
Status 0, and peasant farmers are Status -1. The completely destitute are Status
-2, looked down on by everyone else.</p>

<p>Status is conferred by title or social convention. You are supposed to be
wealthy enought to maintain a lifestyle appropriate to your Status, or to
somehow fake it.</p>

<p>Those who wish to explore Gransys’ stratified society in more detail or make
extensive use of GURPS Social Engineering should give the Status 2+ nobles
Feudal Rank equal to their Status. This Rank would symbolize their official
authority, while Status would be a measure of their social position and
political influence. This would make it possible to have a wealthy merchant like
Fournival from the original game, who doesn’t hold formal Rank in the feudal
hierarchy but has Status 3 or 4. In this model, Fedel and Aldous would have
Courtesy Rank instead of the full version, but would still have the same Status.</p>

<p>If you’re just interested in using Gransys as a backdrop for a Dungeon Fantasy
campaign, then Status and Rank don’t really come into play as advantages.</p>

<h2 id="religion">Religion</h2>

<p>The vast majority of Gransys’ inhabitants follow the monotheistic religion known
as the Faith. Its trappings are quite similar to those of real world
Catholicism, and the god it venerates is called the Maker. It has existed for
centuries, and every village has at least a small shrine or chapel manned by one
or more priests. Gran Soren has a huge cathedral in its noble quarter. There is
also an Abbey in Northern Gransys, home to an order of nuns dedicated to a
humble life of quiet contemplation. The spiritual and administrative center of
the Faith lies outside Gransys, in the mainland.</p>

<p>Ordained members of the Faith go through intense training that ensures they are
quite the adept scholars. Aside from theology, they are well-versed in history,
ancient languages, and other disciplines. Monks and nuns of the Faith seem to
fill a role similar to that of academic researchers in our world.</p>

<p>In addition to the Faith, there are numerous signs throughout Gransys of an
ancient religion practiced in times past. It venerated entities now known simply
as “The Old Gods”, associated with the four elements. Its ruined temples are
buried under the ground waiting for those bold enough to find them. The Faith
regards the religion of the Old Gods with scholarly curiosity, but frowns on
anyone who would consider it more than myth.</p>

<p>Religious Rank in the Faith goes from 0 all the way to 8, but no one in Gransys
has a Rank higher than 4 (the head of the Gran Soren Cathedral). Being an
ordained priest or priestess confers Clerical Investment in addition to Rank,
but brings no supernatural powers. Of course, nothing stops a priest from also
studying magic.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In this Dragon’s Dogma adaptation, I’ve been mostly working from my impressions
of the game itself so far. Recently, though I’ve come accross a video
of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3G5o3KhXv6w">this talk</a> by the game’s creator Hideaki Itsuno that sheds some
light into the thought processes behind its gameplay. It does contain some
spoilers, so beware!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://dragonsdogma.wikia.com">Dragon’s Dogma Wikia</a> site also has some setting information that’s
very interesting to me, and even more spoilery than the video. I’ll be using
that as appropriate.</p>

<p>One interesting tidbit from these two sources is that in-game Gransys is
supposed to be around 3 miles across. So, if my experiment from the previous
post is correct, then the in-game map is compressed by a factor of 10. I’ve
always wondered about that.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/29/dragons-dogma-big-picture.html">previous</a> <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/30/adventuring-in-gransys.html">posts</a> I mentioned that the map of
Gransys is “truncated”. We’ll take a look at why that is today. We’ll
use <a href="http://dragonsdogma.wikia.com/wiki/File:Gransys_map_large_w_labels.jpg">this map</a> as a reference in this article. Be warned that it’s a
fully annotated map, so it contains spoilers for the console game! We’ll also
touch on certain story elements that can be equally spoilery.</p>

<p>As you can see, Gransys looks like somewhat like a capital J. It has coastlines
to the south and east, and is surrounded by nigh-impassable mountains on the
other sides. Its southern reaches are temperate and relatively flat, with the
southeastern coast being warm enough that its inhabitants tend to wear light
clothing. The region north of the capital is noticeably colder and hillier.</p>

<p>Looking at the location labels, we see that signs of civilization
are few and far between. Aside from a few castles, there are only two proper
settlements: the isolated fishing town of Cassardis, and the cosmopolitan
capital of Gran Soren. These are the only two places where you can find normal
civilians going about their daily lives.</p>

<p>The reason for this is simple: there are only so many resources to go around
when developing a video game, both in terms of time and money and in terms of
memory, storage and processing power of the target platform. Thus, every place
in the game fulfills a very specific purpose. They’re either commercial hubs,
dungeons, quest sites, or the bare minimum of “wilderness” necessary to give you
the feeling that you’re traveling in a fantasy world. That last bit is why the
map has no scale, by the way.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we are not quite as constrained here! Our imagination has more than
enough space to let Gransys unfurl to its full size. But what size should that
be? To find that out, I took the <em>totally scientific</em> approach of booting up the
game and walking places while timing how long it took.</p>

<p>If you set out from Cassardis at sunrise, you will arrive at the Shadow Fort
shortly before sunset, roughly 25 minutes later<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. This means that an in-game
hour passes in around 2 minutes of real time. Assuming my lightly encumbered
Mystic Knight has Move 5, she walked for 12 hours at 2.5 miles an
hour<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. That’s a total of 30 miles, or 48km from east to west. The north-south
dimension, from Cassardis to the Blighted Manse, is roughly 1.6 times as long:
48 miles, or 77km.</p>

<p>That’s smaller than I thought! If Gransys was a modern location with good
roads<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, you might be able to drive across it an hour or less. It’s still
quite larger than its in-game layout would indicate, of course, and those
distances are made all the longer by its medieval tech level. If we follow the
advice spread out through the GURPS material on the topic, there should be a
small village every 5km or so in the most hospitable stretches of land, with
the occasional larger market town linking them into a trade network.</p>

<p>“Small” would mean 100-200 people, organized as either a group of houses working
the fields around them, a group of isolated homesteads, or a single large manor
belonging to a local lord (a landed knight or the equivalent). Most houses would
be made of wood with thatch roofs, and most inhabitants would be peasants and
farmers. They might have blacksmiths and other craftspeople, but are just as
likely to have those needs served by wandering peddlers. Settlements of this
size would dot the plains west and north of Gran Soren, and around the
Eradication Site in Southern Gransys. There would also be a few around the
Encampment, though that stretch of land is quite narrow in the game.</p>

<p>Trade towns would have houses made out of stone with shingled roofs. They would
house their share of peasants and farmers (or fishers!) as well, but would also
concentrate more specialized craftspeople that supply a wider area around the
town and might be able to supply an adventuring party with gear. This would also
be the minimum settlement size where one could find inns and merchants with a
fixed address. Cassardis is one such town and there would be more in the South
Gransys plains and north of Gran Soren. In fact, the spots where you can find
those tiny camps with a peddler and a guard doubling as an innkeeper should
probably be trade towns instead.</p>

<p>The next step up from that would be castle towns, whose farms and trades support
a sizable fortification. Part of the town’s buildings would be built inside the
castle’s walls, and the inhabitants would know to run inside in the case of
attack. Finding armorers and such is much easier here than in the smaller
locations. Castles are run by barons or counts, depending on how large the area
they control is. These would obviously be around the castles we see on the map:
the Shadow Fort, Greatwall, and Windbluff Tower.</p>

<p>The only real big city in Gransys is Gran Soren. It’s home to thousands, it’s
well-fortified, and it contains the most well-stocked stores and the best
craftspeople.</p>

<p>Even small villages are pretty much self-sufficient, and most common villagers
would never travel further than about 10 miles (16km) from their home
village. It makes sense that the fishermen of Cassardis wouldn’t know much about
the Arisen! Some people are a fair bit more well-traveled or cosmopolitan than
that, like the nobles who send you on quests all the way across the duchy or the
NPCs who ask to be escorted to those same places. Most news from “outside” are
likely to come from these bold souls, or from similarly bold wandering peddlers.</p>

<p>That gives us a pretty nice canvas to work with! In future posts, we’ll go a bit
deeper into Gransys’ society and notable settlements, with attending GURPS
stats.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><strong>Update</strong>: This is the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy version of the character. If you
want to see a version for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG, click <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/25/pathfinder-dfrpg-barbarian.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>As I write this, I noticed that we’ve had a handful of GURPS posts already and
none of then has included any GURPS stats yet! I’ll try to remedy that
here. Since it might be a while until I have concrete rules to show for the
Dragon’s Dogma project, I’ll go with something completely different for this
post.</p>

<p>As you might know, Steve Jackson games recently completed a very
successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/847271320/dungeon-fantasy-roleplaying-game-powered-by-gurps">Kickstarter campaign</a> to finance the production of a
standalone Dungeon Fantasy boxed set. This gets me in the mood to do something
DF-related. Following the general Octopus Carnival theme of “adaptations”, I
decided to adapt the Pathfinder Iconic characters to GURPS Dungeon Fantasy. From
what I can see, each of the originals is meant to both be a representative of
their character class in the Pathfinder setting and to have a unique gimmick
that helps individualize them. This should be just the right amount of
complexity to illustrate what DF can do, as well. I’m sure a lot of people have
done the same conversions in the past, but these will be <em>mine</em>.</p>

<p>I’ll take each of the DF templates from <em>Adventurers</em> and use them to recreate
the Pathfinder Iconic of the corrresponding class. We’ll pull material from
other books as necessary to cover that character’s distinctive style. This
should limit the complexity of the conversion while still providing an
interesting exercise. The end result might not have the same mechanic “feel” of
the original, but that’s a feature in our case: it will be a Dungeon Fantasy
character, not a Pathfinder character. I’ll try to comment on any notable
differences. Please also note that I’ll be using the current line of GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy PDFs, not the boxed set, which is still a few months away from
publication as of this writing.</p>

<p>The first template listed in the book is Barbarian. Therefore, our first
converted iconic is Amiri:</p>

</figure>

<p>Amiri’s full official bio and character sheet can be
found <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/amiri.html">here</a>. Judging from those, we can glean a few facts about her:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Amiri is good at outdoor survival in cold climates, since she returned from a
“suicide” scouting mission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amiri is of normal human size, but fights with an oversized sword that used to
belong to a frost giant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She’s fiercely competitive and doesn’t like being outdone at barbarian
heroing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She relies a lot on the d20 Barbarian Rage power when fighting, and might get
angry enought to lose her mind. In other words, the purpose of Amiri is to
flip out and kill people.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s how I think she should look like in GURPS:</p>

<h2 id="amiri-248-point-human-barbarian">Amiri, 248-Point Human Barbarian</h2>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 17 {70}; <strong>DX</strong> 13 {60}; <strong>IQ</strong> 10 {0}; <strong>HT</strong> 13 {30}.</p>

<h3 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h3>

<p>Amiri spent 2 points in extra starting cash so she could purchase the big
sword.</p>

<p>Unlike the standard DF 1 Barbarian, Amiri lacks Gigantism, and thus is
SM 0. While I know there’s a “Short Barbarian” option in Dungeon Fantasy
Denizens 1: Barbarians, I don’t own that book and thus simply decided to remove
Gigantism from her character sheet and adjust the point costs accordingly.</p>

<p>Most of her discretionary advantage points went into the Huge Weapons perk that
allows her to wield the sword without penalty, and the Great Rage advantage from
DF 11: Power-Ups. Note that these normally require Gigantism - I waived this
particular prerequisite here.</p>

<p>Taking all of that into account, we have a perfectly playable DF character that
hits all the same points as the original from Pathfinder! In campaign play, good
choices when spending experience would be buying Combat Reflexes, the second
level of Great Rage, ST and weapon skills to make Amiri a better combatant, or
Absolute Direction along with more and higher Survival specialties to make more
skilled in surviving the wilderness.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In this post I continue the discussion of the “high concept” part of this
project. The <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/09/29/dragons-dogma-big-picture.html">previous post</a> finished with a summary of the pile
of material I’ll have when I’m done. In this one I’ll discuss what it’s good
for. What types of campaign can you play in Gransys?</p>

<h2 id="the-eternal-quest">The Eternal Quest</h2>

<p>One alternative that springs readily to my mind is to steal the plot of the
original game. The dragon comes, and the Arisen must confront it and uncover its
secrets. This has the advantage of providing a solid structure and focus to the
overall campaign, but also has the big drawback of holding no big surprises to
anyone who is familiar with the source.</p>

<p>Even if your players don’t know the original game, it’s better to not slavishly
adhere to its detailed sequence of events. The important story elements in the
original are its <em>revelations</em>, those moments when the player solves one of the
many riddles posed by the game. How you get there can and should vary
considerably.</p>

<p>This kind of divergence is helpful both because it keeps familiar players
guessing, and because it keeps the campaign itself fresh for the GM. It also
makes use of the strengths of the new medium, as a tabletop game will
undoubtedly offer far more possible resolutions to a given scenario than a
computer game can. Players will need little incentive to come up with these
novel solutions, and accepting that it’s OK for them to do so will turn their
creativity into another asset for the campaign.</p>

<p>One PC in this campaign must be the Arisen. The others can be either Pawns, or
human allies. Another interesting variation is to have <em>several</em> PCs be
Arisen. This can either be because the Dragon created more than one this time,
or because older Arisen decided to come out of the woodwork for their own
reasons.</p>

<p>The appropriate power level for a campaign of this kind would be 250 points or
more, the standard Dungeon Fantasy power level. The Arisen is always a very
capable individual, and so should be anyone who can fight by their side.</p>

<h2 id="just-the-dungeon-fantasy-please">Just The Dungeon Fantasy, Please</h2>

<p>You don’t <em>have</em> to bother with all this Arisen business if you don’t want to,
of course! Gransys is a perfectly adequate setting for a standard fantasy (or
Dungeon Fantasy) campaign even without that. Decades or centuries pass between
each draconic invasion, leaving plenty of time for people to get into unrelated
trouble in between.</p>

<p>Your party could be a normal group of adventurers who raid dungeons or take on
dangerous jobs for fun and profit. The expanded map we’ll be working on should
have plenty of space for you to fill with extra places to explore, and if the
original game is any indication the inhabitants of Gransys are always needing
someone to control the bandit and monster population or to go into dangerous and
remote spots looking for relics and rare ingredients.</p>

<p>This is pretty much a standard DF campaign with a more fleshed out map and a
variable amount of Dragon’s Dogma flavor. You could even just use the map and
not bother with any of the setting-specific character options if you are so
inclined. 250-point characters are still appropriate, as are “low-level”
125-point templates if the group wants that specific feel.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-the-dungeon">Beyond the Dungeon</h2>

<p>Gransys is also a good place for less dungeon-y fantasy campaigns. There’s
plenty of urban intrigue to be had in Gran Soren and the Duke’s court. Wandering
merchants and peddlers can lead quite eventful lives trying to make a
buck. Soldiers in a remote fort have to contend with monsters from outside and
morale problems from within. And it could even be interesting to step into the
shoes of a regular citizen in this monster-infested world.</p>

<h2 id="loot-and-pillage">Loot and Pillage</h2>

<p>Even if you decide not to use the setting at all, some of the supporting rules
material could still make its way into a campaign set elsewhere. This includes
character templates, any new items or item-related rules, and the
monsters. Dungeon Fantasy can always use more monsters, no matter what setting
it uses!</p>

<h2 id="so-which-will-it-be">So which will it be?</h2>

<p>Most of my efforts here will prioritize the first two approaches. This means they
will be geared towards a campaign mostly based on the Dungeon Fantasy rules,
with 250-point characters and lots of action. There will be rules to play Arisen
and Pawns, but the rest of the material should work perfectly well for games
without these things. I’ll try to include tips on lower point level games where
appropriate.</p>

<p>I will, however take some more time to detail the possible sources of intrigue
in the setting, so those wishing to to focus there will be well-supported.</p>
