<p>This article is part of a series! You can find all of them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>One of the most famous D&amp;D “monster ladders” is the one composed of golems:
humanoid constructs built to do the bidding of powerful spellcasters. They’re
generally inspired by mythology, with the name for the category being taken from
the legend of the Golem of Prague.</p>

<p>Due to the vagaries of alphabetical ordering, the first “golem” our reading of
the Monster Manual hits is the one standing on the very top rung of that ladder:
the Colossus.</p>

<p>Obviously inspired by the Colossus of Rhodes, who was said to animate when its
city was threatened by invasion, colossi are enormous animated statues, often
made in the image of a god or another mighty entity. Like their smaller
relatives, they exist to obey their creators. Of course, not just anyone can
create one of these babies - it requires an epic ritual most commonly known to
entities such as demon lords and divine exarchs.</p>

<p>The name of the single stat block given to us by the Monster Manual hammers the
point home: it presents us with the <strong>Godforged Colossus</strong>. There are no colossi
on the Monster Vault.</p>

<p>The Godforged Colossus is a Huge Immortal Animate (construct). That’s smaller
than I thought it would be, but then again so was the Colossus of
Rhodes. Constructs are not affected by effects that specifically target living
creatures. They also don’t sleep, breathe or eat, and are immune to disease and
poison.</p>

<p>This specific construct is a Level 29 Elite Brute with 662 HP. In addition to
the standard construct immunities listed on its stat block, it’s also immune to
fear and has Resist 30 to both psychic and force damage. It strides across the
land at speed 10. As a golem-adjacent creature, it’s Unaligned, doesn’t speak,
and has Int 4.</p>

<p>As its basic attack the Godforged Colossus wields a weapon made of pure
force. It does an amount of force damage that’s surprisingly close to that it
should be even without the math fix. A hit also triggers a relatively inaccurate
secondary attack against Will, doing another bit of psychic damage and stunning
the target for a turn on a hit. I feel this is a bit of unecessary complication;
to fix it, add the damage of the secondary attack into that of the primary and
make the whole lot “force and psychic”. I don’t think anyone who isn’t another
colossus resists those two simultaneously. You could leave the secondary attack
for the stun effect, or replace it with the push from the Defensive Strike
(below).</p>

<p>The monster’s other standard actions are as follows: it can attack at a range of
20 with a Force Missile, which targets Reflex, does force damage, and pushes 5
squares on a hit. Once per encounter it can unleash the Voice of the Demiurge,
which targets the Will of all enemies within a Close Burst 10 (!), doing
respectable psychic damage and stunning for a turn on a hit.</p>

<p>Finally, as a reaction whenever someone moves adjacent to it, it can use a
Defensive Strike that recharges on 5-6. On a hit it does all the damage of the
basic attack (some force, some psychic) and allows a secondary attack against
Fortitude that on a hit pushes the target 5 squares, knocks them prone, and
dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>No specific mention is made of the material used to build this colossus, though
judging by the resistances I’d say it’s actually made of pure force tinted with
the thoughts of the god who built it.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>The book says a colossus might be a city’s greatest guardian, the idol of a god
that animates to punish defilers, or a pair of great sculptures acting as
guardians of another creature’s lair.</p>

<p>The first one is our old buddy Rhodes; the second brings to mind that demon
statue from the cover of the 1e PHB; and the third is surely the sphinxes from
the Neverending Story. The last boss from Shadow of the Colossus (the Tower)
also fits here.</p>

<p>The first example encounter is level 28, a godforged colossus and 4 dragonborn
champions. Tiamat or Bahamut… or maybe both, with equal teams fighting each
other! Does the level 23 party dare to interfere?</p>

<p>The second is level 29, 1 colossus, 3 sorrowsworn reapers, and 2 shadowraven
swarms. Woe be unto those who trespass upon the fane of the Raven Queen.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m a fan of colossi, particularly of those whose shadow you can stand
under. They make me wish D&amp;D in general had more giant-climbing rules.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This is a bonus article in a series! You can find the rest of them <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">here</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of firearms is a bit thorny in D&amp;D and adjacent games. Some people
like the concept, others feel it doesn’t fit the “medieval” idiom for mechanical
or flavor reasons.</p>

<p>Pathfinder tries to address this by moving everything gun-related to its own
class: the Gunslinger, which came out in its <strong>Ultimate Combat</strong> supplement. The
presence or absence of that class in a campaign acts as a proxy for the presence
or absence of guns<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Dungeon Fantasy ended up going along a similar route - while it leaves guns out
of its equipment list entirely in <strong>DF1</strong> and <strong>DF: Adventurers</strong>, it ended up
publishing the Musketeer professional template in <strong>Pyramid #3/36</strong>, along with
a goodly amount of setting-appropriate guns.</p>

<p>With the material from that issue, we have what we need to stat up the star of
this post: Lirianne the Gunslinger! Here she is:</p>

  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2012 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Like all of Wayne Reynold’s Iconics, this design is a bit busy, but I like the
tricorne hat. Looking at her bio <a href="https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Lirianne">here</a> and her stats <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9a64">here</a>, we can learn
the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lirianne comes from the city-state of Alkenstar in the Mana Wastes, a region
whose ambient magic takes the form of deadly storms that produce mutated
abominations. This hostile environment forced its people to innovate,
advancing their technology to the level where black-powder guns are common.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She was the middle child of three, their father a marshal and their mother an
elf who left while they were young (because for a Pathfinder elf, ten years
and three children is a “fling”). She spent much of her childhood devouring
pulpy tales of adventure and dreaming of starring her own.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Growing up to follow in her father’s footsteps, Lirianne got caught in a mana
storm and teleported thousands of miles north to the mostly-medieval continent
of Avistan - where all those pulpy tales took place. Now she travels as a
wandering do-gooder, in no particular hurry to return home.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lirianne wields two single-shot pistols, which she can load quite quickly due
to Pathfinder’s generous rules for such. Her class abilities allow her to
perform quite a few tricks with these guns.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The GURPS version below uses the Musketeer professional template and the guns
from <strong>Pyramid #3/36</strong>, plus some of the perks from <strong>GURPS Gun Fu</strong> referenced in
that article. Her armor is from <strong>DF: Adventurers</strong>. I’m also using the
Alternate Guns Specialties from <strong>Pyramid #3/65</strong>.</p>

<p>While her pistol’s base reload time is 20 seconds, she manages to get it down to
3 by using paper cartridges (which halve reload time) and by having 3 levels of
Quick-Reload (which cut that further by 75% to a minimum of 3). That’s the
fastest she can get by the book, but I wouldn’t be averse to allowing a fourth
level of Quick-Reload to reduce that time to 1 second, and have her follow the
same “quick-firing” rule bow Scouts follow.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could introduce more modern guns (like revolvers or lever
action rifles) that would allow for a higher rate of fire. Those would make for
some fine loot!</p>

  <figcaption>Fine loot indeed! (by Ekaterina Burmak)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>An <em>Expedition to the Barrier Peaks</em>-like mix of fantasy and ultra-tech would be
extra-awesome for her since the full Gunslinger advantage would allow her to
shoot sci-fi rayguns as well as she does black powder pistols.</p>

<p>Other highlights include Lirianne’s relatively high Acrobatics skill (good for
acrobatic dodges and daring movement), and the other perks which allow her to
shoot a gun in each hand without having to drop either for reloading or doing
almost anything else. She <em>is</em> a bit deficient in social skills, so that might
be something to shore up later with earned points. Other good destinations for
earned points are more Guns (Pistol) and Acrobatics, as well as gun perks and
the Behind the Back power-up.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! You can find all of them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Chuuls are large lobster-like beings with yellowish shells, a semi-upright
posture, and a mass of little red tentacles dangling from their faces. They’re a
mainstain of the Underdark in every edition they appear in, including this
one. They didn’t appear on the Monster Vault, but later on they got a Monster
Vault-style update in Dungeon #192, so we’ll be looking at that as well.</p>

<p>Chuuls are Aberrant Magical Beasts (aquatic). We saw the aquatic keyword
already, back when we read about aboleths, but I don’t think I explained
it. Aquatic creatures suffer no penalties for operating underwater and usually
have a swim speed. They also get bonuses when fighting non-aquatic enemies
underwater.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As magical beasts, chuuls are sapient. They’re not very smart, with Int 4, but
they’re conversant in Deep Speech. They lurk in underwater lakes, still pools
and other sufficiently large bodies of stagnant water, and emerge to snatch prey
with their huge claws.  Chuuls don’t care if that prey is sapient, and will eat
every single part of their bodies except for the brain, whose taste the
creatures dislike. Predictably, this makes them good neighbors to mind flayers,
who will use a chuul pool as a dumping ground for brainless bodies.</p>

<p>The Dungeon article adds a bit more lore. Chuuls live in small groups called
pods, in bodies of still water large enough to support them. They’ll happily use
rivers and seas for long-distance travels, but there’s nothing like an
underground lake or still swamp to settle down and raise your kids. These
creatures only have two ambitions in life: to be left alone and to eat
people. When the first one is frustrated, it means they’re about to satisfy the
second.</p>

<p>Chuuls reproduce by laying sacs of slimy yellow eggs, which they protect
fiercely. Sometimes they’ll attach these sacs to the bottom of ships or
riverboats as a way to help the species propagate further.</p>

<p>As chuuls grow older, they grow bigger and sometimes develop psychic
powers. They also <em>mutate</em> very easily, which makes them a preferred subject for
mind flayer experimentation, and might give even wild chuuls a few extra
interesting traits. Finally, they all share a kind of racial memory. An
individual will remember its previous generation very clearly and have a dimmer
recollection of the ones that came before. One memory from the dawn of time
remains very strong, however: hate humans. Kill them. Devour them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>In both the Monster Manual and the Dungeon article, we get the same two
varieties of this monster:</p>

<p>The classic <strong>Chuul</strong> is a Level 10 Soldier with 109 HP. It’s Large, has
darkvision and both a walking and a swimming speed of 6. Its basic attack is a
claw whose damage is exactly half of what it should be for its level, but that’s
surprisingly okay here because the chuul can make 2 claw attacks per turn
despite not being Elite. These do extra damage against immobilized targets.</p>

<p>If both attacks hit the same target, the Chuul will make a attack against the
victim’s Fortitude using its face tentacles. This does no damage, but
immobilizes on a hit. The tentacles also figure in the Tentacle Net ability, a
passive which automatically immobilizes anyone hit by the chuul’s opportunity
attacks.</p>

<p>The chuul’s ambush predator tactics make it seem like a lurker, but I guess it
doesn’t try to hide again after first emerging, though it prefers to stick to
the water. The Dungeon/Monster Vault version has better claw damage, but is
still largely the same.</p>

<p>Next we have the <strong>Chuul Juggernaut</strong>, a Level 23 Elite Soldier with 434 HP
that’s either very old or was experimented on by mind flayers. It’s Huge, has
ground and swim speeds of 7 and also psychic powers! Psychic Lure is a ranged 10
attack against Will that does psychic damage and pulls the target 5 squares on a
hit. The Juggernaut otherwise fights like the classic model, but is much less
shy about leaving the water. We’re back to having to fix its damage: as an elite
it’s supposed to make two full-damage attacks and not two half-damage ones. This
damage fix is exactly what the Dungeon version does, being otherwise identical.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>The first is level 10, 2 chuuls, a feymire crocodile, and a bog hag. Just to
show you these things also live on the surface and associate with people that
are not mind flayers.</p>

<p>The second is level 23, a chuul juggernaut and three blood fiends. I got nothing
on this one.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The chuul lore in the MM didn’t exactly spark joy, y’know? The additions from
the update make them more interesting in that front. Mechanically they’re solid
opposition, as evidenced by the fact that the update didn’t do more than
increase their damage a bit.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/08/05/dnd-to-ravenloft.html">last post on this subject</a>, I talked about how I accidentally
hijacked a D&amp;D 5th Edition game and turned it into a GURPS Dungeon Fantasy game
using the old-school Ravenloft module for AD&amp;D. Today, I’ll tell you about how
Ravenloft claimed yet another party of ill-fated adventurers.</p>

<p>I don’t think the group actually realized how close they were to winning. It was
almost entirely a psychological defeat. The place was scary and unknown, the
random encounters hard, and they spent the first couple of sessions treating it
like a Diablo dungeon (“run in as fast as possible and kill everything that
moves!”). After that, they became overly cautious, retreating to the chapel
every couple of fights to spend the night and let those healing penalties fade.</p>

<p>They’d inevitably wake up to a random encounter. No, undead can’t enter the
chapel, but those two rust monsters I rolled up that one time sure could! They
didn’t wreck any equipment, but they scared the players just the same.</p>

<p>This became the usual pattern of our sessions, and if it kept up the group would
end up allowing the monsters to slowly grind them to death. I told them as much,
and cautioned them to explore the castle in a more directed and organized manner
if they wanted to win.</p>

<p>That led to a rather fruitful session where they moved with purpose and reached
the room where Strahd’s maid lived. She pleaded for help and offered to lead
them to a stash of treasure in exchange for help in escaping the castle. The PCs
agreed.</p>

<p>She led them up the stairs, staying towards the back of the group for
safety. When they reached the “treasure room”, the maid sprouted claws and fangs
and backstabbed the party, because of course she was a vampire and the treasure
was fake.</p>

<p>They managed to defeat the vampire maid without suffering too much damage, and
it turned out that all of this happened right in front of the door to the throne
room, where I6’s tarot reading told me Strahd himself could be found.</p>

<p>So there they were, mostly unhurt, with a cleric and a paladin in the party, in
possession of both the Icon of Ravenloft and the Sunsword, literally at Strahd’s
doorstep. What did the PCs do? They ran away! The rest of the session was them
finding their way to the outside, still at the second floor, levitating over the
walls and making it back to Barovia.</p>

<p>We ended the session there, and we wouldn’t get to play another. One of the
players outright told me Ravenloft was too hard and he wanted something else, so
I offered to switch to Iron Gods the next session with a fresh batch of
characters. No one else complained or offered a dissenting opinion, so I guess
they agreed. Ravenloft had claimed another party, not by killing them but by
breaking their spirits.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure it was Ravenloft, too, as opposed to shitty GMing on my
part. The Iron Gods game is still ongoing and the players look forward to each
session, so I must be doing <em>something</em> right.</p>

<p>When I next write about this, we’ll see how that Iron Gods game started.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! You can find all of them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Chokers are humanoid creatures with somewhat elongated heads and very long
rubbery arms ending in hands whose palms seem lined with sharp barbs. To better
choke you with, obviously. They’re only listed in the Monster Manual, but they
do get an update in Dungeon Magazine issue 196. This update is part of a series
of articles that are considered “missing pages from the Monster Vault”, so I’ll
cover them here as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The MM doesn’t offer much in the way of choker lore, but the Dungeon article
remedies that nicely.</p>

<p>Chokers love the Underdark but may be found in other favorable environments
closer to the surface, particularly near sapient settlements. You see, they
prefer hunting sapient prey, because in addition to being good eatin’ they often
carry the shiny baubles and jewels which these creatures love to collect and
occasionally fondle. Their arms are so flexible because their internal structure
is composed of many knobby cartilage joints.</p>

<p>Chokers typically live and hunt alone, because they’re so antisocial they see
even other chokers as prey. They gots shinies and meat on them just like anybody
else, precious. These creatures are however just smart enough to accept shiny
bribes in exchange for not eating someone, and sometimes drow or other
underground dwellers can hire them on that basis. Drow in particular don’t like
to do it very often, because they find chokers too unpredictable.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We have two varieties of choker statted up here, both Unaligned and possessed of
Int 6. I suppose this could mean not every choker the party meets is a bandit,
but I don’t think I ever saw any published friendly chokers.</p>

<h3 id="cavern-choker-monster-manual">Cavern Choker (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>This is a Small Natural Humanoid and a Level 4 Lurker with 42 HP. It has
darkvision, a ground speed of 6, and a climb speed of 6 with spider climb.</p>

<p>Its basic (and main) attack is the Tentacle Claw. Its Reach 2 is impressive for
a Small creature, and in addition to doing damage it also automatically grabs
the target on a hit. Grabs in 4e prevent the victim from moving, but not from
performing other actions. They can use an action to attempt to escape the
grab. For monsters without a listed escape DC, such as these chokers, the test
is either the victims Acrobatics vs. the monster’s Reflex, or Athletics vs. the
monster’s Fortitude. In this specific case the target takes a -4 penalty to the
roll to escape.</p>

<p>Some monsters have specific things they can do to grabbed victims. For example,
the cavern choker can use its standard action to choke a grabbed victim, an
attack which deals the same damage as the claw but targets Fortitude and has a
better chance of landing. When the choker is targeted by an attack against its
AC or Reflex, it can use an immediate interrupt to interpose the grabbed victim,
causing the attack to target <em>them</em> instead. This doesn’t work if the attack
comes from the victim itself, obviously.</p>

<p>The choker also has a Chameleon Hide, which it can activate as a minor action to
gain concealment for a turn. It can’t use this while grabbing someone, but it’s
useful for it to retreat using its considerable Stealth.</p>

<p>The tactics write themselves - the choker will lurk on a ceiling and grab
someone when they pass by, while its less sneaky buddies distract the rest of
the party.</p>

<h3 id="cavern-choker-dungeon">Cavern Choker (Dungeon)</h3>

<p>The Cavern Choker from Dungeon remains a level 4 lurker with 42 HP. The main
change from the MM is a significant upgrade to its Chameleon Skin, which now
gives <em>full</em> concealment and is always on as long as the choker doesn’t have
anyone grabbed.</p>

<p>The Choke attack is gone - now the Tentacle Claw does 10 ongoing damage to
grabbed targets until they escape. Escape attempts now have an explicit DC of
21, which is about the same as you’d get under the old rules. Body Shield has
had its text changed and clarified. It’s still an interrupt that redirects an
attack by someone else to the grabbed victim, but now it only recharges when the
choker hits with Tentacle Claw. This means that the monster can only use it
<em>once</em> after it grabs a target, making “grab, release on your next turn, grab
again” preferable to holding on until the target dies.</p>

<h3 id="feygrove-choker-monster-manual">Feygrove Choker (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>This Medium Fey Humanoid is a Level 12 Lurker with 91 HP. A different species,
or the platonic ideal of the mundane choker? In any case its abilities are quite
similar. It has Reach 3 and can grab up to 2 targets simultaneously. When it has
2 grabbed creatures it can choke them both at once; it can use either creature
as a shield, but not against attacks made by either grabbed creature.</p>

<p>As an extra surprise, it can use a power named Vine Fetter, which animates
nearby vegetation in an Area Burst 3 within 10 squares. It targets the Reflex of
enemies in the area and restrains them (save ends) on a hit. This recharges on a
6 and will very likely be the opening move in a fight.</p>

<h3 id="feygrove-choker-dungeon">Feygrove Choker (Dungeon)</h3>

<p>The exact same set of changes also applies to the Feygrove Choker, which remains
a Level 12 Lurker with 91 HP. It can still grab two people instead of just one,
so it has more opportunities to use Body Shield. The damage fixes also have much
more of an impact on it, since it’s a higher-level monster.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h3>

<p>The sample encounter is level 4: a pair of cavern chokers employed by a small
hobgoblin war party.</p>

<p>MM Chokers get a “meh” from me. I didn’t find them that exciting. I guess
they’re the sort of gimmicky Gygaxian monster you’d expect to find alongside
cloakers and piercers, but I didn’t find them appealing outside of that.</p>

<p>I like the additional lore from the Dungeon article, though it definitiely makes
it clear that chokers are more <em>monsters</em> than <em>people</em>. The stat updates are
welcome too. I’d normally just apply a damage fix to the MM stat blocks and call
it a day, but these come with some interesting changes like the boost to
Chameleon Skin.</p>
