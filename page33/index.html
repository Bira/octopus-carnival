<p>Flameskulls! Skulls that are on fire! I don’t know if they existed in previous
editions, but the illustration makes me think of old-school demiliches a
bit. They’re present only in the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Flameskulls are intelligent undead created from the skulls of spellcasters. The
book doesn’t specify if they contain the soul and memories of the skull’s
original owner or if they’re new individuals. It’s possible multiple versions of
the ritual exist and each does something different.</p>

<p>One thing that is certain from the information here is that the “intelligent”
part is an understatement - the standard model has Int 22 and the greater one
Int 30! Not only do flameskulls speak at least 2 languages, they’re also
<em>Unaligned</em>, meaning it’s quite possible one of them would appear as a neutral
or allied NPC instead of a simple hostile monster. I think there’s at least one
published 4e module or comic that does exactly that.</p>

<p>Flameskulls are usually created to serve as guardians, and the ritual that
creates them is apparently older than recorded history, so you can find them in
all sorts of forgotten places. “Younger” flameskulls might be found accompanying
their creators as servants or bodyguards.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Flameskulls are Natural Animates with the Undead keyword. As undead they’re
immune to disease and poison.</p>

<h3 id="flameskull">Flameskull</h3>

<p>The standard model is Level 8 Artillery with 70 HP. It’s size is Tiny, and it
flies at speed 10 (hover). It has Resist 10 fire, Resist 5 necrotic, and
Vulnerable 5 radiant. It also has Regeneration 5, which means I have to explain
how that works now.</p>

<p>Regeneration in 4e is actually similar to 3.5’s Fast Healing. Monsters with
regeneration regain the specified amount of HP at the start of their turn as
long as their current HP total is above 0. That’s it! Any other associated bells
and whistles like those of trolls will be listed as separate traits.</p>

<p>Back to the flameskull: it attacks with a weak Fiery Bite in melee or a much
better Flame Ray (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex) at range. Once per encounter it can use
a Fireball which works more or less like the PC version: Area Burst 3 Within 20
vs. Reflex. Does fire damage on a hit, half on a miss, and the flameskull can
exclude two allies from the effect.</p>

<p>The skull can also manipulate objects using Mage Hand, and it sheds bright light
out to 5 squares, though it can reduce that to dim light out to 2 squares if
it’s trying to be stealthy.</p>

<h3 id="great-flameskull">Great Flameskull</h3>

<p>This one is either very old or made using a more powerful version of the
ritual. It’s Level 24 Artillery with 174 HP and size Small. Do flameskulls grow
with age, or is this something like the skull of an oni?</p>

<p>Stat-wise, it’s pretty much a scaled-up flameskull. Its resistances,
vulnerabilities and regeneration are doubled in intensity, and it’s fireball is
now a Fire Storm (Area 4 within 20 vs. Reflex) whose flames last for a turn and
deal 10 damage to anyone starting their turns there in addition to their initial
attack damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s one sample encounter: a flameskull, 2 mummy guardians and an oni night
haunter who probably created the other monsters.</p>

<p>I like them! I cannot help but remembering Murray from the Monkey Island games
when I see the flameskull illustration, which I guess is a factor in this. The
fact that flameskulls are unaligned and not necessarily hostile is my favorite
thing about them. I’d have to fix their damage before using them, of course.</p>

<p>Ettins are two-headed giants who have been a part of the game since at least
AD&amp;D 1st Edition. Capitalization is important here - ettins are giants, not
Giants, in the sense that they’ve never been part of the Giant entry. They’re
present in both books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Fourth Edition maintains the tradition of giving ettins a separate entry from
the other giants, but this time it includes a bit more lore to back that
decision up. Most of that would be published after the Monster Manual, and is
collected in the Monster Vault.</p>

<p>Ettins are kin to giants in that they originate from a primordial, but their
creation myth is a bit different. It happened some time after the Abyss had
formed - the god Amoth (who isn’t around in the present day) fought Demogorgon
and nearly cleft him in twain. The earth primordial Storralk saw that and
decided to attack Demogorgon while he was weakened.</p>

<p>Turns out Demogorgon wasn’t very weakened at all, and defeated Storralk in
combat. Demogorgon buried Storralk beneath is throne in the Abyss, and as he
gazed at the pools of Storralk’s blood with his brand new two heads, the first
ettins emerged from that blood.</p>

<p>The big D cast most ettins out into the world, reasoning that since they sprang
forth from Storralk’s blood, any pain they suffered would be inflicted on the
still-living primordial. The few ettins bright enough to know about this
creation myth prefer to associate themselves with Demogorgon rather than with
Storralk, since Demogorgon was obviously the stronger of the two and whoever is
strongest is bestest. For this reason, demon-worshipping ettin aren’t all that
uncommon, and you can often find ettins and demons hanging out together. One of
Demogorgon’s exarchs is an ettin.</p>

<p>Even if they’re not demon worshippers, however, ettins are still pretty
terrible. Their two heads argue constantly and struggle to take control of the
body from the other, but they both tend to agree that hurting and eating people
is the height of fun. As a result, ettins are typically Chaotic Evil.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Ettins are Large Natural Humanoids with the Giant keyword. The major ettin
signature trait comes from their two heads, and is named Double Actions. Ettins
roll initiative twice, and take full actions on both results. They also get two
immediate actions, but only one between each of their turns. The two sets of
sense organs also mean that all ettins are trained in Perception.</p>

<p>Some of the ettins presented here also have Dual Brain, a trait which allows
them to automatically end any dazing, stunning or charm effect on itself at the
end of one of its turns.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual has two ettin stat blocks, and the Monster Vault has
four. Only one of them is present in both books, so overall you have five unique
creatures here. Let’s look at they in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="ettin-thug-mv">Ettin Thug (MV)</h3>

<p>The classic model, this is a Level 8 Brute with 110 HP. It runs at speed 6. It
has Double Actions but not Dual Brain.</p>

<p>Its Smash basic attack has very low damage for a level 8 brute, but that’s
because the ettin is going to be making that attack twice per round due to
Double Actions. As a move action it can also Kick (Melee 1 vs. Fortitude), which
pushes the target 2 squares and allows the ettin to move half its speed.</p>

<h3 id="ettin-wrath-chanter-mv">Ettin Wrath Chanter (MV)</h3>

<p>This one is likely one of those demon-worshipping spellcasters. A Level 8 Elite
Controller with 184 HP, it has both Double Actions an Dual Brain.</p>

<p>As the name would imply, the wrath chanter constantly sings a Rage Song in
battle, which works as an Aura 5 that makes everyone within angry. This gives
allies a +2 bonus to attack and damage. Enemies get a -2 penalty to attack but a
+2 bonus to damage.</p>

<p>Since it’s an elite, the chanter’s basic Smash attack deals full damage, and
additionally knocks the target prone on a hit. It can also use magic to Invoke
Fury, a Close Burst 5 that targets a single enemy and hits automatically. It
forces the victim to charge or make a melee basic attack against a target of the
ettin’s choice! At least the charge doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>Against parties that include PCs with decent basic attacks (like Fighters) the
war chanter will likely use Invoke Fury most often, sometimes mixing it up with
Smash against a squishy to set up a particularly damaging charge. If that’s not
the case, it will go the other way around, smashing most often and sometimes
using Invoke Fury to screw up the party’s positioning.</p>

<h3 id="ettin-hunter-mv">Ettin Hunter (MV)</h3>

<p>A slightly more sophisticated ettin who knows the value of killing people at
range. It’s level 10 artillery with 86 HP, and it carries a brace of 10 javelins
into combat. It has Double Actions but not Dual Brain.</p>

<p>All of the ettin hunter’s attacks are considered basic. It can use a javelin in
melee (Reach 2) or throw it (Range 20). It can also throw a javelin extra hard
to Pinion an enemy (Range 20 vs. AC, recharge 5-6). This does more damage than
the normal throw and restrains the target until they can un-impale themselves
(DC 18) or teleport away.</p>

<h3 id="ettin-marauder-both">Ettin Marauder (Both)</h3>

<p>A beefier take on the classic Ettin, this is a Level 10 Elite Soldier with 222
HP. It has both Double Actions and Dual Brain.</p>

<p>It attacks with a full damage Smash that also pushes the target 1 square on a
hit and marks them for a turn. It can also Swat anyone who tries to flank it as
a reaction (Melee 2 vs. Fortitude), pushing them back 3 squares on a hit.</p>

<p>The MM version is pretty much identical, save that its basic attack is named
Club and it specifies that the ettin marauder wields a club in each hand. It’s
interesting that none of the MV ettins specify this. Either the authors thought
it’d be obvious and not worth the wasted space, or they’re stating ettins
normally fight unarmed.</p>

<h3 id="ettin-spirit-caller-mm">Ettin Spirit Caller (MM)</h3>

<p>Another demon-powered spellcaster, this one a Level 12 Elite Controller with 252
HP, Dual Brain, and Double Actions. Its basic attack is a club that pushes the
target 1 square. It can instead choose to spend a standard action casting the
Curse of Shattered Bone (Ranged 10 vs. Will), which makes the next club attack
from the spirit-talker against the target an automatic critical with 1d12 damage
added on top of everything else.</p>

<p>The curse isn’t all that impressive - simply attacking twice might be a better
bet. It would be a lot more dangerous if it made the next hit from any enemy (or
even any ettin) a critical.</p>

<p>This ettin can also perform a Spirit Call which fills a Close Burst 5 with
howling demonic apparitions. This targets Fortitude, does necrotic damage, and
slides the targets 3 squares on a hit.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s one sample encounter in the MM: Level 10, 1 ettin marauder, 2 venom-eye
basilisks, and 3 barlgura demons.</p>

<p>I like the way ettins turned out mechanically here. The stat blocks are simple
and have a strong signature gimmick. Their levels make them a good fit for an
adventure that says “welcome to paragon tier! Now you’re going Against the
Giants.” Ettins are weaker than hill giants in this edition, so they’re the
first humanoid of unusual size the PCs are likely to fight.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>My first contact with ettercaps was in Neverwinter Nights, where if you found a
bunch of giant spiders in a lower-level module you could be sure an ettercap
wasn’t far behind. They’ve been around since at least 2nd edition, when they
appear in the Monstrous Manual. It’s likely earlier editions featured them in
a supplement.</p>

<p>In 4e they still fulfill pretty much the same narrative role as before: hostile,
non-drow spider-wranglers. They appear only on the MM.</p>

<h3 id="the-lore">The Lore</h3>

<p>Ettercaps are sapient humanoids, give or take a few extra limbs. They’re not
terribly bright with a typical Int score of 5. The book describes them as
“primitive, instinctual hunters”, which I guess means Stone Age-level
technology. If evolution was a thing in D&amp;D they’d probably be related to
spiders in the same way humans are to apes.</p>

<p>Ettercaps are carnivorous and hunt using both weapons and their copious natural
gifts, which includes a venomous bite, the ability to produce webs, and a
“spiritual kinship” with arachnids that give them a nearly unmatched ability to
tame these beasts.</p>

<p>Despite being Unaligned, ettercaps don’t mind including other sapients in their
menu, such as your PCs.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>The MM gives us two ettercap stat blocks. They’re Medium Natural Humanoids with
the Spider keyword. Their signature traits are Resist 10 Poison, a climb speed
with Spider Climb, and Web Walker, which allows them to ignore difficult terrain
and other movement effects from spider webs and spider swarms.</p>

<p>They also get a spider bite and some sort of web-spinning power, though the
exact forms these take vary in each stat block.</p>

<h3 id="ettercap-fang-guard">Ettercap Fang Guard</h3>

<p>This level 4 Soldier has 56 HP and all the common traits described above. Its
speed is 5 in all movement modes. It wears leather and wields a greataxe in
combat.</p>

<p>The basic greataxe attack has the High Crit property but is otherwise pretty
standard. The fang guard’s spider bite requires combat advantage and does a less
damage than the axe, but triggers a secondary attack against Fortitude that
stuns the victim for a turn and causes ongoing poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>The fang guard gains +2 to attack and damage rolls against a restrained or
immobilized target, and it can try to immobilize them with its Web Tangle
attack, which targets reflex and immobilizes (save ends) without doing damage.</p>

<p>I suspect a MV-style makeover would likely make the spider bite a single
attack against Fortitude.</p>

<h3 id="ettercap-webspinner">Ettercap Webspinner</h3>

<p>I believe this one is the closest to the “classic model” from previous
editions. A Level 5 Controller with 64 HP, the web spinner also possesses the
standard abilities outlined at the start of this section.</p>

<p>It fights with a Reach 2 longspear, and its spider bite doesn’t stun but still
does ongoing damage. As a 1/round minor action, the webspinner can cast a Range
5 Web Net that targets reflex and restrains on a hit (save ends; no
damage). With a bit of effort it can make a bigger net and create a zone of
Webbed Terrain (Area 2 Within 10 vs Reflex), which immobilizes everyone it hits
(save ends) and creates a zone of difficult terrain until the end of the
encounter. This recharges on a 6, so you might end up with quite a lot of
webbing all over the battlefield if you roll well or have multiple webspinners
in an encounter.</p>

<p>Any ettercap can safely ignore the difficult terrain from the webs, and this is
likely true of a lot of other spider monsters, so they’ll want to use this as
often as they can.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 4: 1 webspinner, 2 fang guards, and 2 deathjump
spiders.</p>

<p>One mechanical problem I see with these ettercaps is that they must usually
choose between doing damage and impairing movement on each of their
turns. They’re also built with a more “naturalistic” approach that actually
makes the Level 5 webspinner do less damage in its attacks than the Level 4 Fang
Guard. If neither issue is fixed, they’ll be less of a threat against the PCs
than the numbers might indicate.</p>

<p>In the end I see no reason to include ettercaps in your game unless you’re going
all-in on the spider theme, and I don’t lament their absence from the Monster
Vault.</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned elves plenty of times already, and now it’s time to talk about
them properly. They’ve been available as a playable character option since the
days of Basic (though arguably Basic elves were closer to eladrin).</p>

<p>This entry is for the elves you might meet as enemies or NPC allies. They’re
present in both the MM and the MV.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>We’ve already looked at drow and eladrin, so we know that 4e elves are an
offshoot of an ancient fey people created by Corellon who migrated from the
Feywild to the world and went through some adaptative changes over the
generations.</p>

<p>They look pretty much like what you’d expect a D&amp;D elf to look: slender, sharp
features, pointy ears. They’re about as tall as humans, perhaps a tiny bit
shorter. Their hair has “earthier” colors than those of eladrin, with several
shades of brown being the most common along with tones like moss-green, autumn
orange, and so on. Their eyes can be brown, green, blue or violet, and have a
more familiar “sclera and iris” arrangement than the solid orbs of color found
in eladrin. Elf skin tones are the same as those found in humans, with the
darker tones being more common.</p>

<p>Elves primarily worship Melora and the primal spirits, so their relationship
with nature is more reverent and has a greater conservationist bent than that of
eladrin. Eladrin alter a forest with magic so that it grows harmoniously around
and within their shining cities; elves prefer to adapt their own lifestyle and
settlements to fit the existing natural landscape, which is how you get treetop
villages.</p>

<p>To a human elves usually seem laid-back and flighty, as their lifespans are
still large enough that they take a long view of most things. Still, they’re
less aloof and disinterested than the eladrin, since they do live in the world
and care about what happens here.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We have four elf stat blocks here, two of which are exclusive to the MM and all
of which are early-Heroic. Elves are Medium Fey Humanoids with the same
signature traits they get as PCs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low-light vision</li>
  <li>Speed 7.</li>
  <li>Wild Step, which lets them ignore difficult terrain when shifting.</li>
  <li>Elven Accuracy, which lets them re-roll an attack once per encounter.</li>
</ul>

<p>The MM versions also get Group Awareness, which gives +1 to the Perception tests
of all allies within 5 squares. This is absent from the MV, as it’s more
relevant to PCs than to monsters.</p>

<h3 id="elf-archer">Elf Archer</h3>

<p>Can’t get more typical than this! Present in both books, the archer is Level 2
Artillery with 32 HP and all common elf traits. It also gets Archer’s Mobility,
gaining a +2 bonus to attacks in turns where it moves 4+ squares.</p>

<p>It wields a longbow and has a shortsword for emergencies, neither of which is
affected by the damage bug. It also has a triggered ability called Not So Close,
which allows it to shift 1 square and make a ranged attack against an enemy that
makes a melee attack agains it. This is a reaction, so the enemy attack has to
be resolved before the elf can get away.</p>

<p>Crossbowdwarves fight in close formation; eladrin bow mages spread out a bit
more; elven archers are tree-hopping ninjas that never stay still.</p>

<h3 id="elf-scout">Elf Scout</h3>

<p>Okay, you can get more typical than that. The Elf Scout took the two-weapon path
instead of going with archery. As such, it’s a Level 2 Skirmisher with 39 HP and
all common elf traits. It’s present in both books.</p>

<p>It wields a longsword in one hand and a shortsword in the other, each counting
as a basic attack. It can attack with both in one action using Two-Weapon Rend,
dealing a bit of extra damage if it hits with both blades. It also sneak attacks
for 1d6 extra damage. Yes, the two effects can stack.</p>

<p>No special mobility powers other than the common traits, which already make the
scout pretty mobile.</p>

<h3 id="elf-hunter">Elf Hunter</h3>

<p>A Level 2 Minion Skirmisher, the elf hunter is likely a literal hunter that has
to defend themselves in a pinch. It lacks Elven Accuracy but has all other
common traits. It fights with a shortsword, and its basic attack allows it to
shift 2 squares on a hit or 1 on a miss.</p>

<h3 id="elf-noble-guard">Elf Noble Guard</h3>

<p>Wearing mail and wielding a longsword, the noble guard is a Level 3 Soldier with
46 HP and all common elf traits. It retains its Speed 7 even in mail. As
expected of a soldier, the longsword attack marks for a turn. It can also use a
Hobbling Strike which does more damage and immobilizes for a turn on a hit. On a
miss it does half damage and slows instead. This also counts as a basic attack,
so it can be used in charges and the like, but it recharges on 5-6 so the
simpler longsword blow will still see plenty of use.</p>

<p>If someone ignores the noble guard’s mark, it can attack that enemy as a
reaction, dealing standard longsword damage and immobilizing the target on a
hit.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s one sample encounter in the MM: Level 2, two archers, two scouts, and
two grey wolves. A typical war party made up of typical members.</p>

<p>These stat blocks do a good job of conveying that wood elf flavor. In most
campaigns I think it’s more likely that the PCs will end up having some of them
as NPC allies than as enemies, just as with dwarves. Still, plenty of campaigns
are likely to have at least one enclave of paranoid forest guardians who shoot
strangers on sight.</p>

<p>A little rejiggering of signature traits and the addition of spiders can also
turn the sample encounter into a party of drow scouts for some early-Heroic
foreshadowing of Underdark shenanigans.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Elementals have been part of D&amp;D since its very beginnings. Their basic
definition has remained the same throughout: they’re living aglomerations of
elemental matter who often take roughly humanoid forms and have powers related
to their constituent element. They often get summoned by wizards to fight their
enemies, or can be found either as bound guards or as fantasy wildlife.</p>

<p>In earlier editions, you had your four classic elemental planes: Fire, Air,
Water, Earth. They were pretty much composed entirely of their naming element
and were basically places to summon elementals from, since nothing else could
live there. AD&amp;D and its Great Wheel cosmology added a bunch of “quasi-“ and
“para-“ elemental planes that served as sources of more exotic
elementals. You know how it goes: water and fire equals steam, so there’s a
steam plane that’s home to steam elementals, and so on.</p>

<p>Fourth Edition instead has the Elemental Chaos, which we already looked at when
talking about demons. It contains <em>all</em> elements, whether they’re the classic
four or some of the other mixes. It’s also a lot more interesting in that it’s
possible for PC adventurers to go there and have adventures in fantastic and
varied landscapes without much in the way of magical life support. It has entire
cities and civilizations of creatures with the Elemental origin.</p>

<p>And it also has small-e elementals! Their basic nature remains the same, and
they make up much of the “wildlife” of the Elemental Chaos, but much like their
new home plane they can be made up of multiple elements. In fact, 4e went so
hard for these amalgam beings that traditionalist players began to complain that
they never saw plain old single-substance elementals any more. The classics
would finally appear in the Monster Vault.</p>

<p>Elementals don’t necessarily band together by element type. Many of them follow
orders from more powerful beings from the Elemental Chaos such as efreets and
titans, and will form up in whatever way their orders require. “Wild” elementals
do like to stick together with others who share one or more of their elements
though.</p>

<p>Let’s look first at the Monster Manual elementals, then at the Monster Vault
ones.</p>

<h2 id="monster-manual-elementals">Monster Manual Elementals</h2>

<p>The MM gives us four elementals, all two-element and with levels spanning the
paragon and early epic tier. As usual, the reasoning for these levels is that
the Elemental Chaos is a place you explore when you hit paragon tier, and so
these creatures are a sample of what might oppose you once you’re there. All of
them are Large Elemental Magical Beasts, with keywords corresponding to their
constituent elements. They have Int scores between 6 and 8, so they’re not
mindless but not geniuses either.</p>

<h3 id="firelasher">Firelasher</h3>

<p>Made of Air and Fire, the firelasher looks like a fire whirlwind with long, thin
tentacles for arms. It’s a Level 11 Skirmisher with 108 HP, immune to disease
and poison, and with fire resistance 25. It flies with speed 8 (hover).</p>

<p>Its basic melee attack is the titular fire lash (Melee 2 vs. Reflex, fire
damage). It also has a special attack named Wildfire Cyclone (Close Burst 2
vs. Reflex, recharge 5-6). This does fire damage on a hit, in addition to
pushing the targets and knocking them prone. On a miss, it still does half
damage. And it can also make a Whirlwind Dash, which allows it to fly <em>twice</em>
its speed without provoking opportunity attacks and deal 10 automatic fire
damage against anyone whose squares they fly through. This recharges on a 6 and
will likely be used whenever available.</p>

<p>This one pairs very well with other creatures that are resistant to fire, since
it won’t need to worry about hurting them with its Whirlwind Dash.</p>

<h3 id="rockfire-dreadnought">Rockfire Dreadnought</h3>

<p>Sitting at the other end of Paragon Tier, this Earth and Fire beast is a Level
18 Soldier with 170 HP. It’s immune to disease, petrification and poison, and
has Resist 25 fire. It runs at speed 8.</p>

<p>This one really feels like it should be a Brute, because it has two very simple
attacks: the Fist of Flame (basic, Melee 2 vs. Reflex, fire damage) and a
chucked Brimstone Rock (Ranged 10/20 vs. AC, physical and fire damage). No
marks, no additional riders.</p>

<h3 id="earthwind-ravager">Earthwind Ravager</h3>

<p>A cyclone full of rocks! It’s a Level 23 Controller with 219 HP. It’s immune to
disease, petrification and poison, and flies with speed 8 (hover).</p>

<p>The ravager’s basic attack is a simple Slam (Melee 2 vs. Fortitude, physical
damage). It can also trap a victim in a Wind Devil (Ranged 5
vs. Fortitude). This does some damage on a hit and immobilized the victim for a
turn. It can also be sustained with a minor action, causing the victim to remain
immobilized for another turn and take some automatic damage.</p>

<p>The ravager can also surround itself with a Whirlwind (Close Burst 1
vs. Fortitude) which does damage and pushes targets 2 squares on a hit. And
finally it can use a Buffeting Blast (Close Blast 3 vs. Fortitude, recharge 5-6)
which does damage and stuns for a turn if it hits.</p>

<p>One of your PCs <em>will</em> remain immobilized for the duration of the combat unless
they can stop the ravager from spending that minor action every
round. Immobilized PCs are of course prime targets for the Buffeting Blast.</p>

<h3 id="thunderblast-cyclone">Thunderblast Cyclone</h3>

<p>To close it out we have a living storm made of Air and Water. It’s Level 26
Elite Artillery with 382 HP, and Huge instead of Large. Immune to disease and
poison, it also has Resist 30 to lightning and thunder and a fly speed of 10
(hover).</p>

<p>This elemental has two basic attacks, a Reach 3 Lightning Arc and a Range 10
Lightning Bolt, both of which target Reflex and do lightning damage. It can also
emit Thunderclaps (Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude) that cause thunder damage.</p>

<p>When cornered, it can respond by generating a Charged Mist in a Close Burst 3,
which hits automatically for some lightning damage and turns the creature
insubstantial for a turn. Insubstantial creatures can still be hit by attacks,
but they halve all damage they take (including ongoing damage).</p>

<p>Using Charged Mist also charges up the Lightning Storm power (Area Burst 3
Within 20 vs. Reflex), which does a generous amount of thunder and lightning
damage, half on a miss.</p>

<h2 id="monster-vault-elementals">Monster Vault Elementals</h2>

<p>The Monster Vault tries to address some long-standing criticism from those
traditionalists I mentioned at the start of this post: that the good old
single-element quartet was nowhere to be seen, and that there were few
elementals suitable for low-level adventurers.</p>

<p>It presents us with four entries, the Lesser Elementals of Air, Earth, Fire and
Water. They’re all level 1 or 2, and Small in size. Presumably there’s a
3.x-like progression of increasingly powerful traditional elementals, but those
are left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<h3 id="lesser-air-elemental">Lesser Air Elemental</h3>

<p>This Level 1 Lurker has 23 HP, flies with speed 6 (hover), and has Vulnerable 5
fire for some reason. It has a passive trait named Phantom on the Wind, which
makes it automatically turn invisible whenever it starts its turn without an
enemy adjacent to it. This lasts for a turn or until the elemental makes an
attack.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a relatively weak slam. Its main trick is the Grasp of
Storms (Melee 1 vs. Reflex), which can only target creatures that can’t see the
air elemental. A hit does more damage than the slam and grabs the target (escape
DC 12). Grabbed targets take 5 ongoing damage and absorb half the damage of any
attack directed against the monster while the grab lasts. Only one victim at a
time can be grabbed.</p>

<p>A whole pack of these striking from ambush would be Fun (TM), particularly if
they manage to grab multiple PCs. More powerful versions, in addition to being
bigger and having a higher level, could probably turn Grasp of Storms into a
close burst and be able to maintain more grabs at once.</p>

<h3 id="lesser-earth-elemental">Lesser Earth Elemental</h3>

<p>This Level 2 Soldier has 42 HP. It walks and burrows at speed 5, and has
Tremorsense 5, allowing to sense anyone in that radius as long as they’re in
contact with the ground or a wall.</p>

<p>Its Earth Glide trait allows it to phase through earth and rock at will, and its
Brittle Skin trait means it takes a -2 to its defenses for a turn if it takes
any thunder damage.</p>

<p>Its only attack is a slam, which does damage as usual and prevents hit targets
from shifting for a turn. There’s also the Overwhelming Stone ability, which
triggers when a nearby enemy hits one of the elemental’s allies with a melee
attack. The elemental automatically knocks the attacker prone! This recharges
once the elemental is first bloodied.</p>

<p>More powerful versions can probably use Overwhelming Stone more often, and
likely turn it into an attack that can do damage.</p>

<h3 id="lesser-fire-elemental">Lesser Fire Elemental</h3>

<p>A Level 1 Skirmisher with 27 HP, the lesser file elemental runs at speed 8 and
flies at speed 4 (clumsy). Its passive traits mean it cannot shift for a turn if
it takes cold damage, and causes 3 damage to anyone who misses it with a melee
attack.</p>

<p>Its slam attack targets Reflex is remarkable for not doing any immediate
damage - it only does ongoing fire damage (save ends). Lesser fire elementals
can also shift as a minor action instead of a move one.</p>

<p>More powerful versions should likely add immediate fire damage to their melee
attacks, and more damage on missed attacks.</p>

<h3 id="lesser-water-elemental">Lesser Water Elemental</h3>

<p>A Level 1 Controller with 29 HP, the lesser water elemental walks and swims with
speed 6. It is of course Aquatic, and taking cold damage causes it to take 5
extra damage from the next attack that hits it.</p>

<p>Its slam does relatively little immediate damage, but also does ongoing 5
damage. I guess it fills the target’s lungs with water. It also has an encounter
power called Whelm (Close Blast 3 vs. Fortidude, affects only enemies). On a hit
this does damage, pushes the target 2 squares and knocks it prone.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the elemental can slide each creature taking ongoing damage
from its slam by 1 square as it uses the water in their lungs to push them
around.</p>

<p>More powerful versions likely can use Whelm more often and perhaps have it cause
ongoing damage as well.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The MM has two encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11: A firelasher and a bunch of yuan-ti cultists, placing the elemental
as summoned muscle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: A rockfire dreadnaught, 2 fire giants, and a mind flayer
mastermind. I guess ol’ squidface managed to snag himself some beefy thralls.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As for the MV lessers, I guess it’s actually possible to fight all four of them
at once, as they don’t actually get in each other’s way! I’d likely add a second
air elemental to make it a proper five-monster band. You can also add them to
any band of low-level opponents that include a spellcaster who could plausibly
summon them.</p>
