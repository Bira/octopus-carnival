<p>Half-elves have been a part of D&amp;D since races were first separated from classes
back in AD&amp;D 1st Edition. I guess they might have been inspired by Elrond from
Lord of the Rings, who was said to be a half-elf. They appeared as a playable
option right in the first PHB, but they’re only getting their monster/NPC
entries here.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>I’m happy to report that Fourth Edition half-elves no longer follow the tired
and somewhat problematic “outsiders to both parent cultures” narrative from
previous editions! In fact, everyone likes them!</p>

<p>You see, half-elves aren’t just an “average” of their two parents. Yes, they’re
sturdier than elves and pointier than humans, but they also have a lot of traits
that are uniquely their own. Chief among those is a noticeable facility with
social interaction and cultural adaptability.</p>

<p>Half-elves whose parents are a human and an elf can spend their early years in
either of the two cultures, depending on their specific family
circumstances. Their names and mannerisms tend to be taken from that
culture. You can also have all-half-elf cultures and communities whose
human and elven ancestors are several generations behind them. In all cases it’s
very common for individuals to journey abroad for a while out of a sense of
curiosity and wanderlust, and they tend to fit in well in any place where they
linger for a while.</p>

<p>Of course, “Nice” doesn’t necessarily mean “Good”, and you can also find
villainous half-elves who become bandit leaders or fall in with dark
forces. They’re technically better-suited to be infernal warlocks than
<em>tieflings</em>, given their stat adjustments.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three stat blocks here, more suitable for use as opposition than as
allies, though they could also fill that role in a more morally ambiguous
adventure.</p>

<p>Half-elves are Medium Natural humanoids, with a native speed of 6 and low-light
vision. Everything else about their stat blocks comes from training.</p>

<h3 id="half-elf-bandit-captain">Half-Elf Bandit Captain</h3>

<p>This could be a murderous marauder or a Robin Hood figure. They’re a level 6
Skirmisher with the Leader keyword and 69 HP. They wear light armor, wield a
sword, and carry a bunch of throwing daggers.</p>

<p>The <strong>sword</strong> is a basic melee attack that allows the captain to shift 1 square
on a hit. Their basic ranged attack is a thrown <strong>dagger</strong>. A maneuver named
<strong>Slash and Dash</strong> (recharge 4+) allows them to make a sword attack, shift 2
squares and throw a dagger. Their leaderly move is named <strong>Triggering Slash</strong>
(recharge 5+), a sword attack that on a hit allows an ally to shift 1 square and
make a melee basic attack of their own.</p>

<h3 id="half-elf-con-artist">Half-Elf Con Artist</h3>

<p>This is a Level 7 Controller with 77 HP. Whether they’re a lovable rogue or a
dastardly deceiver depends on which side of the con you’re on. The con artist
goes unarmored and clad in fine clothes, with a dagger hidden somewhere for
protection. They’re trained in all the skills you’d expect them to have:
Stealth, Bluff, Thievery, and Insight.</p>

<p>That <strong>dagger</strong> isn’t anything special, but it deals extra sneak attack damage
if the con artist has combat advantage against the target. Their real weapon is
<em>manipulation</em>, though. This is implemented as a trio of charm powers that
target Will. It’s up to you whether they’re actual magic or just the con artist
being very sly and convincing.</p>

<p><strong>Deceptive Maneuver</strong> is an at-will melee power that causes the target to make
a melee basic attack against an ally of the half-elf’s choice. The classic
“getting between two enemies to make them hit each other”.</p>

<p><strong>Silver Deception</strong> (ranged 10; recharge 5+) does no damage, but dominates the
target until the end of the con artist’s next turn.</p>

<p>And <strong>Pathetic Appeal</strong> is an encounter power that targets every enemy in a
close burst 5 and, on a hit, prevents them from attacking the con artist until
they pass a save. If the con artist makes an attack roll against an affected
target, they get an immediate extra save against this effect. “I’ve seen the
error of my ways, honest!”</p>

<p>To close things out, <strong>Grifter’s Flight</strong> is another encounter power that allows
the con artist to shift 6 squares and make an unpenalized Stealth check at the
end</p>

<h3 id="half-elf-baleful-thaumaturge">Half-Elf Baleful Thaumaturge</h3>

<p>An epic-level evil wizard for all of your epic-level evil wizard needs. The stat
block itself is Unaligned, so you could also use it to represent a wizard that’s
merely edgy. No reason it has to be a half-elf either, the stats could apply to
any Medium sapient. Their magic has a “blood and teeth” theme, which gives you a
hint as to what kind of entity they learned it from.</p>

<p>The thaumaturge is Level 24 Artillery with 169 HP. They go unarmored, and wield
a wand as an implement. Their basic melee attack is an <strong>Infernal Slam</strong> that
targets Will. A hit damages the target, pushes it 3 squares, and allows the
thaumaturge to teleport 3 squares. Their basic ranged attack is a <strong>Soul Bite</strong>
spell (ranged 10 vs. Reflex) that does physical damage and gives the thaumaturge
10 temporary HP on a hit.</p>

<p>The “bitey” theme continues with their two special attacks. <strong>Wall of Shadow
Teeth</strong> (recharge 5+) creates wall 2 squares high and 8 squares long within 10
squares of the caster. This wall bites, attacking anyone adjacent to it. A hit
deals necrotic damage and immobilizes the target (save ends). It lasts for a
turn but can be sustained with minor actions.</p>

<p><strong>Mouths of Hell</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Will; encounter) deals heavy psychic
damage and also gives the thaumaturge 10 temporary HP. This creates a zone of
ghostly maws that lasts until the end of the encounter, deals 15 psychic damage
to anyone caught inside, and gives the caster 5 temporary HP when it damages
someone in this way.</p>

<p>The thaumaturge can also spend 5 temporary HP if it has them to teleport 8
squares as a minor action, with a spell called <strong>Bloody Step</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There isn’t much of a theme to the half-elves in this entry, but I guess that’s
the point. They’re as varied as humanity. Each individual entry has their own
thing going.</p>

<p>The two sample encounters we get are a Level 7 one with a bandit captain leading
a gang of humans and halflings, and a Level 25 one with an epic lich and its
entourage of 2 thaumaturges and 2 slaughterstone hammerers.</p>

<p>Here we see something of a rarity in this series: a monster whose 4e incarnation
I find <em>strictly worse</em> than its previous ones.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Gray Renders first appeared in 3e, where they were these big, clawed,
carnivorous brutes with an oddly endearing trait: they would sometimes imprint
on another creature and basically dedicate their lives to protect it and take
care of it. This creature could be a sapient, or even a PC if the GM was feeling
cute.</p>

<p>Fourth Edition gray renders lose the imprinting, and replace it with a constant
urge to destroy and feed. Some sages theorize they’re somehow tied to the
metaphysical concept of entropy despite being natural beasts, since they seem
particularly fond of targetting sapient settlements.</p>

<p>I don’t like this change because, as you might have surmised by now, I’m not
fond of always-hostile, attacks-on-sight-and-fights-to-the-death monsters. I
literally never saw anyone mention grey renders online without also mentioning
and praising the imprinting. Remove that and you’re left with something that’s
virtually indistinguishable from, say, a goristro demon.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gray Renders are Large Natural Humanoids with a Chaotic Evil alignment and
Int 2. They’re Level 19 Elite Brutes with 452 HP and blindsight, who fight using
claws, bites, and sheer brutality. In other words, almost like slightly smaller,
slightly dumber goristros with blindsight. They have Speed 8.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Claw</strong> that also grabs on a hit. They can make
two claw attacks per action, and if both hit the same target they also inflict
ongoing damage on account of the rending. They can use a grabbed victim as a
club, inflicting more damage than the claw, pushing the target of the attack 4
squares from the impact, and dealing half the rolled damage to the “weapon”. Or
they can bite the grabbed victim for massive damage, with a Daze rider.</p>

<p>While bloodied, their claw attack also knocks a target prone on a hit.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Gray renders are said to be too destructive to cooperate with anyone, but some
predators and scavengers have taken to following them from safe distance to
exploit their rampages. So we get these encounter groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: 1 gray render, 1 bodak skulk, 2 guulvorgs. Opportunistic followers
can be sapient too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 20: 1 dire bullette, 1 gray render, 3 nabassu gargoyles. The gargoyles
are watching the kaiju battle and waiting to feast on the loser’s remains.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The stat block is cool, but the lore is “meh” at best. Reskin this into a demon
and/or add the imprinting back to make it more interesting.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I think Goliaths first appeared in the Races of Stone supplement for 3.5. In
Fourth Edition, their first appearance was as a playable option in the
PHB 2. They get their corresponding “monster” entry here, with a couple of stat
blocks suitable for use as opposition or NPC allies.</p>

<p>They’re one of the many playable peoples designed to give players a “taste” of
being a cool fantasy monster without being unbalanced. Eladrin arguably do it
for Sidhe; dragonborn do it for dragons; tieflings for fiends; deva for
angels. Goliaths do it for giants.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-goliath.png"/>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>The typical goliath is stated to be between 7 and 8 feet tall, so whether
they’re on the large side of Medium or the small side of Large is a matter of
opinion. The book’s opinion is that they’re Medium, since that allows them to be
playable. Their skin is gray or brown, and speckled with coin-sized bony growths
that look like rocks.</p>

<p>Goliaths have existed since shortly after the Primordials created the world,
which might mean they’re a kind of byproduct of the creation of the Giants in
the same way the origin of the Dragonborn is tied to that of dragons. Goliaths
don’t care enough about that to make myths about it, though.</p>

<p>All throughout their history they’ve preferred to keep to a nomadic existence in
the more mountainous areas of the world, so there isn’t much about them in other
people’s records either. While it’s fairly common for individual goliaths to
travel the “lowlands” as adventurers or explorers, they haven’t engaged in any
grand diplomacy or empire-building as a people.</p>

<p>Culturally, goliaths place a lot of value in individual skill and prowess, and
this makes them very competitive. Their communities probably have all sorts of
tournaments and contests in their calendars. Individual goliaths tend to turn
everything into a contest, even if only in the privacy of their own minds - they
keep score and constantly compare themselves both to their companions and to
their own past performance. That battle where Legolas and Gimli compare their
kill counts? That’s every fight where a goliath is involved. This does have the
downside of making them get a bit depressive when they fail to measure up to
their own standards.</p>

<p>I suspect Kord is a very popular deity among goliaths, and they also often
worship the primal spirits.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As far as the rules are concerned, Goliaths are Medium Natural Humanoids. They
have a natural speed of 6, and human-equivalent senses. Their signature ability
is <strong>Stone’s Endurance</strong>, a minor-action encounter power which gives them
some resistance to all damage for a turn. The value of this resistance is 5/tier
(5 at heroic, 10 at paragon, 15 at epic).</p>

<h3 id="goliath-sunspeaker">Goliath Sunspeaker</h3>

<p>This is more of a primal priest of the sun spirits than a cleric of Pelor,
focused on burning people with sun-powered lasers. Sunspeakers are Level 7
Artillery with 64 HP, wearing light armor and using an orb as an implement.</p>

<p>Their melee basic attack is the <strong>Sunspeaker’s Hand</strong>, which targets Reflex and
deals light radiant damage. <strong>Solar Sphere</strong> does the same at Range 20 with
better damage.</p>

<p>Less often, the sunspeaker can use <strong>Solar Rays</strong> (recharge 4+) against up to 2
targets within Range 10. This deals light radiant <em>or</em> fire damage, as well as
ongoing damage of the type chosen (save ends). This allows them to potentially
stack two sources of ongoing damage on someone with the same power.</p>

<p>If cornered, the sunspeaker can use <strong>Flaring Leap</strong> (move action; encounter) to
jump 3 squares and then move its remaining speed. This jet-powered jump causes a
fire in the sunspeaker’s starting space, which deals damage to adjacent enemies
or to those foolish enough to enter the flaming square. The fire lasts for a
turn and can be sustained with minor actions.</p>

<p>Finally, it can use a big area attack named <strong>Call Down The Sun</strong> once per
encounter, which is a bit weaker than Solar Sphere but targets a lot of people
and does half damage on a miss.</p>

<h3 id="goliath-guardian">Goliath Guardian</h3>

<p>A more straightforward but no less powerful martial type. The guardian is a
Level 9 Soldier with 96 HP. It’s heavily armored by still has speed 6, wielding
a bastard sword and a light shield.</p>

<p>Its basic <strong>sword</strong> attack marks for a turn, and if the target is prone it’s
also prevented from getting up for the same amount of time. The guardian knocks
people prone with <strong>Ram’s Charge</strong> (recharge 5+), a maneuver that deals light
physical damage and has a long list of riders: it pushes the target 2 squares,
knocks it prone, and allows the goliath to make a free sword attack against the
target. As the name says, it can be used as part of a charge.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Warrior’s Leap</strong> is a passive that allows the guardian to jump
without provoking opportunity attacks. It still uses the standard jump rules
(and it’s high Athletics score) for that.</p>

<p>Guardians are awesome in moutainous terrain that’s full of cliffs. Even if their
targets aren’t thrown overboard, they’ll still stay on the ground for quite a
while, granting advantage to the guardian and any sneak-attacking skirmisher
buddies.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Goliaths often team up with similarly-inclined mountain-dwellers, which can
include dwarves, galeb duhrs, or goblins. I suppose that might include stone
giants as well, if you level your goliaths up a bit. The sample encounter is
level 9, and includes a galeb duhr rock-caller, 3 goliath guardians, and 1
sunspeaker.</p>

<p>I like goliaths, they fill a very specific “huge person” niche. These two stat
blocks are interesting from a mechanics standpoint as well.</p>

            <p>Golems showed up in the first MM and were iconic enough to later make it to the
Monster Vault. I covered those <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/30/golem.html">here</a>, and you can check that same post to
see their basic lore. The Monster Manual 2 brings us yet more golems, which
share the same basic lore.</p>

<p>As before, golems are Natural Animates with the Construct keyword. They’re
immune to disease, poison, and sleep. They have darkvision, and though their
ground speed tends to be high they cannot shift. Most are Large, but one of the
examples here is Huge.</p>

<h2 id="bone-golem">Bone Golem</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-golem-bone.png"/>

</figure>

<p>Bone golems are made from the skeletons of several creatures, whose bones are
sharpened and fitted together to form the construct’s body. Despite being made
of bones and beloved of necromancers, it’s a construct animated through
elemental magic and not an undead monster. Throw this one into an encounter that
does have undead skeletons in it, and it should be good to surprise your PCs a
bit.</p>

<p>Bone Golems are Level 12 Elite Brutes with 302 HP. It’s so spiky the pointy bits
count as a <strong>Bone Spikes</strong> aura (1) that deals 5 damage to any enemy that enters
it. The pointy bits also justify the <strong>Osseous Retaliation</strong> trait, which deals
a bit of automatic damage to anyone who hits the golem with an opportunity
attack.</p>

<p>This construct fights with Reach 2 <strong>Bone Spurs</strong>, and can attack twice per
action with them. It can also fire a <strong>Bone Volley</strong> (burst 3 vs. Reflex,
recharge 6+) that deals heavy physical damage and dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>When the golem is destroyed <strong>Bone Death</strong> allows it to make one last
attack. If Bone Spurs is charged then it uses that, otherwise it makes a basic
bone spur attack.</p>

<h2 id="chain-golem">Chain Golem</h2>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-golem-chain.png"/>

</figure>

<p>These Huge golems are modeled after chain devils, and are often tasked to guard
prisons and Actual Dungeons instead of the usual tombs or treasure vaults. As
you might have guessed, their fighting style is very grapple-intensive.</p>

<p>Chain Golems are Level 22 Elite Soldiers with 418 HP, a speed of 8, and all
standard golem traits. Their <strong>Entangling Chains</strong> act as an aura (3) that slows
everyone caught inside.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 3 <strong>Chain</strong> that does physical damage and pulls
the target 2 squares. <strong>Chain Smash</strong> is their double attack power, allowing it
to attack two different targets in one action. While they’re bloodied, <strong>Berserk
Attack</strong> allows them to make a chain strike against anyone who damages them as a
reaction.</p>

<p>All that and we didn’t even use the grappling rules yet! We have to do that for
<strong>Chain Grab</strong>, though. This at-will attack is a Close Burst 2 that does the
same damage as the basic strike, pulls targets 1 square, and grabs them. The
escape DC is 32 or 35 depending on the skill you use. The golem can move away
from the grabbed victims without ending the grab because chains. Once it
finishes moving it can either slide the victims next to itself or let them go.</p>

<p>So your typical chain golem will try to keep the whole party grabbed while it
smacks them around with its chains. PCs who aren’t grabbed will still be slowed,
and the golem’s strikes will pull them back if they try to run away. Staying far
away and using ranged attacks is a good tactic against them, but that speed of 8
will make keeping away a real chore.</p>

<p>Clay Golems were one of the original golem types described in the first entries
back in AD&amp;D or in the nebulous times before it. They were originally inspired
by the legend of the golem of Prague, and so were the only golem that required
divine magic to make (all the others were arcane).</p>

<p>In Fourth Edition, <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/12/eidolon.html">eidolons</a> are used to represent divine constructs, so
clay golems have the same arcane/elemental origin as the other types. They have
a somewhat “runny” appearance, but are surprisingly fast and retain a slightly
less harsh version of the ability to inflict unhealing wounds that they had in
previous incarnations.</p>

<p>Stat-wise, they’re Level 15 Elite Brutes with 368 HP, Large size, a speed of 6,
and all common golem traits. Their basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Slam</strong> that does
heavy physical damage and curses the target, making it unable to regain HP. This
is a (save ends) condition, but it’s still quite dangerous, since it makes
wounds inflicted by <em>all</em> enemies unhealing, not just the golem’s. <strong>Clay
Smash</strong> allows it to slam two different targets in one action, and they have the
same Berserk Attack reaction as the chain golem above.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Hasty Reaction</strong> passive trait allows them to roll initiative twice and
take the highest result, and <strong>Unstoppable</strong> is a move-action encounter power
that allows them to move 8 squares and pass through enemy spaces. They draw
opportunity attacks when doing this, but reduce their damage by 10. This isn’t
worded like a resistance, so I guess powers that bypass or reduce resistances
don’t work against it.</p>

<h2 id="iron-golem">Iron Golem</h2>

<p>These made it into the MV, so we already covered them. The MM2 has two versions,
the Level 20 one that we saw, and a Level 26 “Iron Golem Juggernaut” that’s
basically the same aside from being size Huge and having bigger numbers.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Each kind of golem presented here gets a sample encounter. I guess there was
something of an editing snafu here, because most golems have their encounter
listed right after their stats, but the one for chain golems is all by its
lonesome in an “Encounter Groups” section at the end of the overall entry. I
guess it must be there because it has two golem types in it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 1 bone golem, 4 horde ghouls (minions), 1 human wizard lich. So
that’s the kind of caster who makes bone golems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 1 clay golem, 1 shadar-kai gloom lord, 2 shadow snakes. A Zehiri
operation, if you still want to associate clay golems with clerics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 21: 1 chain golem, 1 dark naga, 1 iron golem. Someone <em>really</em> wanted
this place guarded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 24: 1 iron golem juggernaut, 1 storm gorgon, 1 djinn skylord. A noble,
his pet, and his mechanical manservant.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a point past which adding more golem types feels a bit redundant. There
are also so many non-golem constructs out there that I almost think “golem”
should be a singular monster type with very specific characteristics, rather
than a whole family of them. Otherwise it would be best to do away with the term
entirely.</p>

<p>D&amp;D Fourth Edition uses “Goblins” to describe a set of closely related species
of humanoids: actual goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. They’re a very
traditional component of the game and we looked at lots of them in the
MM1/Monster Vault Let’s Read. The post covering their basic lore is <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/22/goblinoids.md">here</a>.</p>

<p>Since the first Manual covered them so well, the second brings us a small number
of more specialized stat blocks for them.</p>

<h2 id="bugbear-wardancer">Bugbear Wardancer</h2>

<p>Wardancers are specialized martial artists. Their weapon of choice is a
two-handed heavy flail, which they swing in wide arcs while moving through enemy
forces in the battlefield. The end result looks something like a dance, thus the
name. There’s a religious element to the art: there are different schools
organized around the worship of different exarchs of Bane, who compete among
each other to see whose war dance is the best.</p>

<p>The wardancer presented here is a Level 6 Skirmisher with 70 HP, low-light
vision, and Speed 7. Its basic attack is a <strong>Flail Dance</strong> that does physical
damage and has a lot of stacked riders: it pushes the target 2 square and knocks
it prone, and also allows the bugbear to shift 1 square. Yes, this is an at-will
basic attack.</p>

<p>The wardancer also has a couple of special attacks. <strong>Flail Barrier</strong> (recharge
5+) does a bit of automatic damage in a burst 2 around the bugbear, and makes it
take half damage from weapon attacks until the end of its next turn. <strong>Flail
Assault</strong> (close burst 2 vs Reflex; encounter) does a bit more damage and knocks
those it hits prone.</p>

<p>All the wardancer’s attacks deal extra damage if it has combat advantage against
the target.</p>

<h2 id="goblin-acolyte-of-maglubyet">Goblin Acolyte of Maglubyet</h2>

<p>Another martial artist, this one a goblin from a sect devoted to Maglubyet. In
previous editions (and again on 5th), Maglubyet is the main goblinoid deity, but
here he’s one of Bane’s Exarchs. His acolytes seek to make themselves in his
image.</p>

<p>The Acolyte is a Level 1 Controller with 29 HP, Speed 6, and low-light
vision. They wield a battleaxe in combat, and back it up with a bit of divine
magic.</p>

<p>Acolytes are surrounded by a <strong>Life Scourge</strong> aura (2) that prevents enemies
inside from recovering hit points. Their basic attack is a <strong>Slashing Shroud</strong>
that consists of an axe strike that also makes the acolyte invisible to the
target until the end if the acolyte’s next turn. A good option against PC
defenders.</p>

<p>They can attack at range with the <strong>Hand of Maglubyet</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Fortitude), a telekinetic attack that deals force damage and either slides
the target 3 squares or immobilizes it for a turn. <strong>Maglubyet’s Fists</strong>
(recharge 5+) allows them to use this attack twice in a single action. So as far
as martial artists go, this is one of those annoying hadouken spammers.</p>

<p>The acolyte also has the standard <strong>Goblin Tactics</strong> power that allows it to
shift 1 square as a reaction when missed by a melee attack. This is what you
would change if you were making acolytes of other species.</p>

<h2 id="lolthbound-goblin">Lolthbound Goblin</h2>

<p>Goblins are generally big on Bane worship, but that’s not universal among
them. This is a goblin whose people have been slaves to the drow for
generations. Their training, and even their physiology, have some important
differences from your usual goblins. They’re clearly meant to be encountered
alongside drow, though for that to work out you’ll need to make those drow lower
level or the goblin higher level.</p>

<p>As written, the Lolthbound Goblin is a Level 3 Soldier with 45 HP. They have
speed 6, and replace the usual low-light vision with full darkvision. They wear
light armor and fight with a war pick.</p>

<p>When Lolthbound Goblins are within 5 squares of a drow, they gain a +2 bonus to
all their attacks and defenses. That <strong>pick</strong> is a high-crit weapon and marks
targets for a turn on a hit. Once per encounter they can use a <strong>Stinging Blow</strong>
that deals poison damage and instead of marking increases any ongoing poison
damage the target is taking by 5. This synergizes with the poisoned weapons drow
so often carry.</p>

<p>Also once per encounter they can use a <strong>Lolthbound Shriek</strong> (close blast 5
vs. Fortitude), which deals light thunder damage to anyone in the area who is
not a drow or spider.</p>

<p>Aside from the usual Goblin Tactics reaction, they also have <strong>Drow Protector</strong>,
an interrupt where the goblin throws himself in front of a drow that’s just been
targetted by an attack, becoming the target instead.</p>

<h2 id="lolthbound-goblin-slave">Lolthbound Goblin Slave</h2>

<p>This is a Level 12 Minion Skirmisher version of the lolthbound goblin above,
which makes it appropriate for use with drow without the need for level
adjustments. They’re also armed with war picks, and add a hand crossbow to their
loadout.</p>

<p>Their basic melee attack is a <strong>Stinging Pick</strong>, which works just like the
Stinging Blow from the regular version. Their basic <strong>crossbow</strong> attack deals a
bit more damage if they’ve moved 3 or more squares before making it.</p>

<p>They also gain the attack and defense bonus from being near drow, and have
Goblin Tactics.</p>

<h2 id="hobgoblin-fleshcarver">Hobgoblin Fleshcarver</h2>

<p>This is the hobgoblin specialized martial artist. Unlike the bugbear and goblin
examples, fleshcarvers don’t seem to have a religious component to their
training. It’s all about hard work and crafting your own custom-fitted
weapons. Their weapons of choice are a polearm and a set of poisoned throwing
darts, whose poison is harvested from serpents they hunt as part of their
training. Fleshcarvers never refuse a challenge to combat, though they’re smart
enough to not let such a challenge distract them in the middle of an ongoing
battle.</p>

<p>Fleshcarvers are Level 6 Elite Controllers with 146 HP. They have Speed 6 and
low-light vision, wear heavy armor, and are armed with the afore-mentioned
specialized weapons.</p>

<p>Their stance and movements act as an aura (2) named <strong>Fleshcarver’s Trap</strong>,
dealing 5 damage to any enemy inside the first time they move during their
turn. Their <strong>glaive</strong> is reach 2 and is used both for basic attacks and for an
at-will <strong>Glaive Flurry</strong> that targets all enemies in a close burst 2, does more
damage than the basic attack, and slides targets 2 squares.</p>

<p>At range they can throw those <strong>Toxic Darts</strong> to do a bit of poison damage and
slow the target (save ends). If the target was already slowed, it’s immobilized
instead. When they’re hit by a melee attack, they can use their reaction to
shift 2 squares and make a dart attack. And finally, fleshcarvers have the same
Hobgoblin Resilience and Phalanx Soldier powers from MM1 hobgoblins.</p>

<p>These hobgoblins are more effective when lots of enemies are in reach, but the
selective targetting on their area attack means they engage all those enemies
while fighting in formation for that sweet defense bonus from Phanlanx Soldier.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>These new goblinoid specialists can be inserted into any goblin encounter, and
being goblins themselves also work well with any of their typically allied
creatures. These are the encounters we get on the book:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 1: 1 goblin acolyte, 3 goblin warriors, 1 Lolthbound Goblin. It’s likely
the whole group are drow slaves, with the LBG being their leader. The level
math works out, but the LBG’s drow-related skills are wasted here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 2 bugbear wardancers, 2 bugbear warriors, 1 barghest battle lord. A
warlord and their bodyguards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 1 fleshcarver, 3 hobgoblin soldiers, 2 dire wolves. A patrol with a
little extra kick to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 4 lolthbound goblin slaves, 1 drow priest, 2 blade spiders, 2 drow
warriors. Lots of poison being thrown around on this one, which makes the
minions more dangerous than their level would indicate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like these new additions, because their stat blocks are interesting and their
associated lore fleshes goblin culture out a bit more. I like that they’re
complex enough to have multiple martial styles.</p>
