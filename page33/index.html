<p>Slaads show up in the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition Monster Manual (though they might have
appeared earlier in a supplement for 1e). In Fourth Edition, they are only on
the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Slaads are froggy-looking monsters who inhabit the Elemental Chaos and whose
psychology can be summed up as “LOL, so random”. Their grip on reality, both
mental and physical, is very tenuous. Your typical Slaad makes the Mad Hatter
look quite centered, and any relationship between what it says to you and what’s
actually happening tends to be coincidental. Not that most people get a chance
to talk to them - most of their interactions with other beings are violent.</p>

<p>The main reason everyone hates them, though, is that they reproduce by sinking
their ovopositor claws into people and injecting them with eggs, which hatch
explosively in a few days to produce a “tadpole” the size of a large dog. That
tadpole, in turn, takes another handful of days to grow into an adult. In true
slaad fashion, the sub-type of the new individual is random and has no relation
to the sub-type of its parent. Having a slaad egg implanted in you is treated as
a disease called Chaos Phage by the rules.</p>

<p>Slaads were Chaotic Neutral in the old alignment system and 3e in particular
made a big deal out of saying they were an expression of “pure chaos untainted
by morality”. The distinction between that and Chaotic Evil turned out to be
largely academic, though, so in 4e’s alignment system all slaads are Chaotic
Evil. They’re not out for omniversal destruction like demons are, but “fuck shit
up for shits and giggles” fits both their usual MO and the description of
Chaotic Evil.</p>

<p>There’s a bit in Secrets of the Plane Below about how slaads used to be both
more protean and mentally stable back in Olden Times, but a couple of
particularly powerful slaads broke their metaphysics to ensure they would remain
at the top of the heap. That’s why they all look like humanoid frogs, and why
they are color-coded for your convenience despite being “the most chaotic”
creatures.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Most Slaads are Medium Elemental Humanoids. They have low-light vision, a land
speed of 6, and a variable teleport speed. They’re also immune to Chaos Phage,
just to underscore that they need to infect non-slaads to reproduce.</p>

<p>Every slaad has a basic <strong>claw</strong> attack that does damage as normal for the
monster and triggers a secondary attack vs. Fortitude on a hit. If the secondary
attack hits, the victim is infected with Chaos Phage. Other attacks and powers
vary with the type of slaad.</p>

<p>Chaos Phage is a nasty level 16 disease, with an Improve DC of 25 and a Maintain
DC of 20. Stage 1 has no visible symptoms, but there’s a slaad egg inside you
now. Stage 2 inflicts a -2 penalty to Will and makes you go berserk while
bloodied, forcing you to always attack the closest living creature (ally or
enemy). Stage 3 is death as a slad tadpole rips you open and crawls out.</p>

<h3 id="slaad-tadpole">Slaad Tadpole</h3>

<p>Tadpoles are Small, which means they’re the size of a large dog or a
halfling. They’re Level 5 Lurkers with 44 HP, and are more interested in running
and growing up than in fighting. They have a weak bite that makes them
insubstantial for a turn when it hits, and they can shift 2 squares as an
interrupt when attacked in melee.</p>

<p>Tadpoles are suitable for use in an heroic-tier adventure where the goal is to
prevent them from growing into adult slaads.</p>

<h3 id="grey-slaad">Grey Slaad</h3>

<p>Also known as Rift Slaads, these used to be among the most powerful in their
ladder, but have been somewhat demoted. They’re Level 13 Skirmishers with 128
HP, a teleport speed of 4, and all common slaad traits.</p>

<p>Rift slaads mostly fight with their claws, and back them up with space-bending
defensive powers. Once per encounter they can <strong>Induce Planar Instability</strong>
(Close Burst 3 vs. Will), which does a little damage, slides the targets 3
squares, and knocks them prone. When they’re hit with an attack that causes a
condition (like slowed, dazed, and so on), they can use <strong>Condition Transfer</strong>
as an interrupt to make the condition affect someone else instead. This counts
as a Ranged 5 attack vs. the Fortitude of the chosen target.</p>

<p>When they’re first bloodied, rift slaads cause a <strong>Planar Flux</strong> that teleports
them 8 squares and turns them insubstantial for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="red-slaad">Red Slaad</h3>

<p>Also know as Blood Slaads, these are straightforward bruiser types. They’re
Level 15 Soldiers with 146 HP and all common slaad traits. Their land speed is
8, and their teleport speed 4. They have a second basic attack in the form of a
<strong>bite</strong> that does a bit more damage than the claws but doesn’t inject any eggs.</p>

<p>Their main special technique is the <strong>Leaping Pounce</strong> (recharge 5-6) which
allows them to shift 4 squares and make two claw attacks against 1 or 2
enemies. If any of them hit, the target is marked for a turn. This is the only
way they have to mark enemies.</p>

<p>Once per encounter a blood slaad can produce a <strong>Horrid Croak</strong> (close blast 5
vs. Fortitude) that does no damage but immobilizes its targets for a turn on a
hit.</p>

<h3 id="blue-slaad">Blue Slaad</h3>

<p>Also known as Talon Slaads, they’re notable for having Wolverine-like bone claws
sprouting from their hands. Talon Slaads are Level 17 Brutes with 200 HP. Their
teleport speed is 2.</p>

<p>Their big talons transmit the Chaos Phage as usual, and can also be used to
<strong>fling</strong> victims willy-nilly. This is a bit weaker than the basic attack but
slides the target 2 squares and knocks it prone on a hit.</p>

<p>Once it’s bloodied, the talon slaad gains access to <strong>Ravager’s Fury</strong> (close
burst 2 vs. AC; encounter), an attack that gives it 20 temporary HP if it hits
anyone.</p>

<h3 id="green-slaad">Green Slaad</h3>

<p>Also known as Curse Slaads, they’re the brains of the family with Int 15 where
the others have 9 or 11. A curse slaad is a Level 18 Controller with 173
HP. It’s teleport speed is 6, equal to its normal movement, so it has no reason
to walk anywhere.</p>

<p>Aside from the usual claws, they can shoot <strong>Chaos Bolts</strong> as a ranged basic
attack vs. Will, which do untyped damage and daze for a turn. Occasionally they
can use <strong>Transpose Target</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex; recharge 6) to do some
damage and teleport a target 10 squares to somewhere it can see. And once per
encounter it can use a <strong>Croak of Chaos</strong> (close burst 4 vs. Fortitude) to do
damage over an area and slide the targets 4 squares, rearranging most of the
battlefield.</p>

<p>Green Slaads were also the most “wizardly” of the bunch, so they could very well
know all sorts of weird rituals and non-combat magic.</p>

<h3 id="black-slaads">Black Slaads</h3>

<p>When your run-of-the-chaotic-mill slaad gets infected by the energies of the
Abyss, you get one of these. Also known as Void Slaads, they lose the ability to
reproduce but gain all sorts of entropy-based powers and a more active
malevolence than that of their lesser kin. A lot of their attacks are
energy-based or infused, but since that energy is pure entropy their damage is
untyped.</p>

<p>Void Slaads are Level 20 Skirmishers with 191 HP. They’re Large, immune to all
disease (not just Chaos Phage) and insubstantial. They run at speed 6 and
teleport at speed 3. They retain their standard low-light vision.</p>

<p>A void slaad’s <strong>Claws</strong> don’t lay eggs. Instead, in addition to their standard
damage they do 10 ongoing damage (save ends). Each failed save eats a healing
surge in addition to prolonging the damage! Perhaps they implant miniature black
holes instead of eggs.</p>

<p>They attack at range with <strong>Rays of Entropy</strong> (ranged 20 vs. Reflex), which
damage and surround the target with an entropic shroud (save ends). While the
shroud is active, the target takes extra damage from all attacks that hit it!</p>

<p>When a void slaad dies, it explodes into a <strong>Zone of Obivion</strong> (close burst 2
vs. Reflex) that damages everything in its area. It persists until the end of
the encounter, blocking line of sight and dealing the same damage as the initial
attack to everything that enters it.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Most slaad encounters are slaad-only, but sometimes they’ll ally themselves with
other creatures for some mysterious reason. The sample MM encounters present two
such situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 2 gray slaads, 2 red slaads, and a destrachan far voice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 19: 1 black slaad, 2 rockfire dreadnoughts, a fire giant forgecaller,
and 2 firebred hellhounds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I kinda like these guys, and I like that they’re Chaotic Evil in 4e. I never
bought that story about how they’re some pure manifestation of Chaotic Neutral
even though most of what they do is kill people and lay eggs in their chest
cavities, not necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>I had never read of skull lords before reading about them here, but they have a
very 3e vibe to them so likely originated there. They are only on the Monster
Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Despite the imposing name and the very Metal illustration, skull lords are made
to be lieutenants. They’re created by powerful necromancers or liches to command
their hordes of lesser undead, so they always answer to some higher power.</p>

<p>The book doesn’t get into much more detail than that, but it seems to me like
skull lords are created undead similar to skeletons. They were never alive and
the bones are just raw materials for their creation. Unlike common skeletons,
they’re sapient and quite intelligent.</p>

<p>The first skull lords in recorded history emerged from the ruins of the Black
Tower of Vumerion. Vumerion was a “legendary human necromancer” who apparently
had his career cut short by a band of intrepid adventurers, and those skull
lords might have been part of his contingency plans. They roam the land looking
for a way to bring their dread master back to the world.</p>

<p>The ritual for making skull lords eventually made its way out of those tower
ruins, too, so you might find these monsters working for anyone with the stomach
to make them.</p>

<p>Each of those three skulls anchors a different set of magic powers, and all
three must be destroyed to destroy the monster itself.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Skull Lords are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead keyword, and Level 10
Artillery with a paltry 40 HP. This is not a typo, and you’ll see why soon. They
have darkvision, a speed of 6, and the standard undead resistances (immunity to
disease and poison, necrotic resistance, radiant vulnerability).</p>

<p>Skull lords project an aura (2) named <strong>Master of The Grave</strong>, which grants
Regeneration 5 and a +2 bonus to saves to any undead allies inside. The aura is
anchored to the Skull of Death’s Command, below, so if that’s destroyed it
stops.</p>

<p>The skull lord’s basic attack is a <strong>Bone Staff</strong> that does a mix of physical
and necrotic damage, but the three skulls are the main event. Each has an attack
power that can be used as a minor action once per round, meaning the skull lord
can use all of them in its turn if it doesn’t move.</p>

<p>The <strong>Skull of Bonechilling Fear</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will) does a bit of cold
damage and pushes 5 squares on a hit as it makes the target run away.</p>

<p>The <strong>Skull of Whithering Flame</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) does fire and
necrotic damage.</p>

<p>And the <strong>Skull of Death’s Command</strong> (Ranged 10) restores a destroyed undead
minion within range. This an instance where I think the word “minion” <em>isn’t</em>
being used as a game term, since the text also mentions the minion has “full
normal hit points” when restored. So yeah, what this does is bring back an
undead creature under the skull lord’s command as long as it’s level is at most
the skull lord’s +2 (12 by default). The creature appears in the square where it
was destroyed and stands up as a free action. It has full HP and can act
normally when its next action rolls around. This is an <em>at-will</em> power, just
like the others.</p>

<p>One additional effect of these <strong>Triple Skulls</strong> is that when the lord hits 0
HP, a random skull is destroyed and it instantly heals back to full. It loses
the powers associated with the destroyed skull but is otherwise able to keep
acting normally. This is why it only has 40 HP - it’s a multi-stage monster
whose HP total is 120.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounters are nothing surprising:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 2 skull lords and 3 skeletal tomb guardians.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: 1 skull lord, 1 vampire lord, 2 zombie hulks, 9 vampire spawn
bloodhunters.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in both cases the skull lords could restore any of the other monsters
in these encounters. If the PCs don’t learn to destroy the skull lords first,
they’re gonna have a bad time.</p>

<p>I like these things! They look badass and can be quite dangerous.</p>

<p>Skeletons have been in the game since the beginning, when they were the first
step on the Undead Power Ladder. In this edition, they’re on both the Monster
Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Skeletons are the true iconic undead of the fantasy genre. Vampires and zombies
get the spotlight in a lot of other media, but from Harryhausen movies to the
Diablo franchise, if it’s a fantasy story about fighting monsters, it has to
have skeletons in it somewhere. D&amp;D took inspiration from the former and went on
to inspire the latter, so it has plenty of skeletons as well.</p>

<p>D&amp;D skeletons are likely to be among the first undead faced by a party of
adventurers. Unlike their more powerful and exotic relatives, they almost never
arise naturally, and their existence as undead is completely disconnected from
who they might have been in life. They’re just bones animated by necrotic
energy.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault goes all-in on the flowery gothic prose when describing them,
discoursing about how even inanimate skeletons are viewed by the living as
symbols of death. You might be able to read something of the person’s life in
the scars of their bones, but that only serves as an even stronger reminder that
they’re gone (“alas Yorick, I knew thee well…”).</p>

<p>Skeletons behave much like stupider golems, going by the MV’s
description. They’re just smart enough to understand their master’s orders,
which they follow tirelessly and to the letter. Their animating force doesn’t
possess much in the way of cunning, so even if it can fight well a skeleton
might still fall for relatively simple ruses, or be unable to identify obvious
signs of danger.</p>

<p>It is much easier to animate a skeleton than to create a golem, which indicates
that all that gothic prose actually has a point. If I’m allowed to speculate
until the end of this paragraph, I’d say necromantic magic leans heavily on that
association to give a skeleton its motion and its rudimentary mind. As a result,
it is by its very nature somewhat transgressive, and the proper mindset to use
it likely includes active disrespect for the boundaries between life and death,
which isn’t something you need to create a construct.</p>

<p>While the most common use for skeletons is as minions of some necromancer bent
on conquest, they can also be ordered to perform simple physical tasks. A noble
who wanted to appear particularly edgy could have his carriage pulled by
skeletal horses. A <em>society</em> who wanted to look edgy could have all sorts of
“automatic” gates, bridges and dungeon traps powered by skeletal labor.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual mentions in passing that skeletons might arise naturally in
an area heavily suffused with necrotic energy. That’s likely a rare exception,
and even then it’s an event that has nothing to do with who the skeletons used
to be or how they died. If a rift to Thanatos opened in a cemetery containing
only good people who died happy and without any unfinished business, their bones
would still rise. Such skeletons simply attack anything living they come across
and stay still otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Skeletons are Medium Natural Animates with the Undead keyword. They have
darkvision, immunity to disease and poison, 10 resistance to necrotic damage and
vulnerable 5 to radiant damage. Their base land speed is 6. Despite being nearly
mindless at Int 3, they usually fight with weapons.</p>

<p>All skeletons we get in both books have levels in the Heroic tier, and are
apparently assumed to be human skeletons. You could easily make more powerful
skeletons with higher resistances if you wanted, of course, as well as skeletons
originating from creatures of different sizes (like a Large giant skeleton or a
swarm of Small goblin bones).</p>

<h3 id="decrepit-skeleton-both">Decrepit Skeleton (Both)</h3>

<p>A skeleton so old it’s begun to crumble, this is a Level 1 Minion Skirmisher. It
fights with a <strong>longsword</strong> in melee and a <strong>shortbow</strong> at range and has no
special attacks at all and no traits aside from the common ones listed above.</p>

<p>They should appear in similar numbers and use similar tactics to all those
fragile archer skeletons from Diablo.</p>

<h3 id="skeleton-mm">Skeleton (MM)</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 3 Soldier with 45 HP, wearing mail and wielding a
sword and shield. Its <strong>longsword</strong> attacks mark for a turn, and it has a
<strong>Speed of the Dead</strong> trait which gives it +2 to attack and +1d6 to damage when
making opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>A pretty straightforward soldier-type, like it probably was in life.</p>

<h3 id="blazing-skeleton-both">Blazing Skeleton (Both)</h3>

<p>A skeleton that is on fire. It’s Level 5 Artillery with 53 HP. It has resist
fire 10 on top of its other resistances, and projects a <strong>Fiery Aura</strong> (1) which
does 5 damage to enemies caught inside. It fights in melee with its <strong>blazing
claws</strong>, and throws <strong>flame orbs</strong> at range. The claws do physical damage and
ongoing fire damage (save ends), while the orbs do both immediate and ongoing
fire damage (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="boneshard-skeleton-mm">Boneshard Skeleton (MM)</h3>

<p>A shattered skeleton held together by magic, it’s a Level 5 Brute with 77 HP. It
wields a <strong>scimitar</strong> in combat, which is a high-crit weapon that does a mix of
physical and necrotic damage. It can attack at range by flinging its shards,
also doing those same types of damage. Once when it’s bloodied, and once when
it’s destroyed, this skeleton detonates a <strong>Boneshard Burst</strong> (close burst 3
vs. Reflex) that does necrotic damage.</p>

<h3 id="skeletal-legionary-mv">Skeletal Legionary (MV)</h3>

<p>A minion version of the basic armored MM skeleton. A Level 7 Minion Soldier, it
uses a <strong>sword</strong> in close combat and throws <strong>javelins</strong> at range, both of which
mark the target for a turn on a hit. It has no other special abilities.</p>

<p>These sound perfect for that undead Roman legion you never knew you wanted to
use.</p>

<h3 id="skeletal-tomb-guardian-both">Skeletal Tomb Guardian (Both)</h3>

<p>This four-armed monster isn’t a random corpse given motion, but something
specifically constructed so it could be animated. It’s a Level 10 Brute with 126
HP, and wields a scimitar in each of its four hands.</p>

<p>Each scimitar is kinda weak on its own, but the guardian’s basic <strong>twin
scimitars</strong> attack allows it to use two of them, and its <strong>Cascade of Steel</strong>
attack allows it to attack with all four. <strong>Sudden Strike</strong> allows to make a
Twin Scimitars attack against an adjacent enemy that shifts, as an interrupt.</p>

<p>All of the scimitars are high-crit weapons, so if the guardian rolls really well
its damage output goes up considerably.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get two encounters in the MM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 3: 1 hobgoblin warcaster, 2 hobgoblin guards, 2 skeletons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 1 tiefling darkblade, 2 blazing skeletons, 2 boneshard skeletons.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As we can see, any enemy group that includes a spellcaster of some sort could
very well include a complement of skeleton auxiliaries. We also have enough
variety in their stat blocks to have plenty of all-skeleton encounters for all
your ancient crypt needs.</p>

<p>I like skeletons, and as I said I think the game wouldn’t feel like a proper
fantasy RPG (let alone D&amp;D) without them.</p>

<p>Shifters first appeared as a playable option in 3e’s Eberron Campaign Setting,
and would return to that role when the 4e version of Eberron was released. Their
first appearance in this edition was as an entry in the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>We already mentioned shifters while looking at lycanthropes: they are the
children of a lycanthrope and a human parent. They usually look like humans with
pointy ears and extra hair, but when threatened can “shift” into a more bestial
mode, growing fangs, claws, and yet more hair. This is not as extensive as a
lycanthrope’s transformation - a shifter in “beast mode” is still recognizable
as the same person. The exact characteristics of that transformation depend
on the type of lycanthrope whose lineage the shifter belongs to.</p>

<p>In the 4e implied setting, shifters can be found living among humans or other
humanoid creatures. Some are wild enough at heart that they prefer to hang out
with lycanthropes and their attending animal packs. Shifters also breed true, so
the child of two shifters will be themselves a shifter.</p>

<p>Like most species who are playable character options, shifters have no
species-wide disposition for good or evil. Some are heroes, some are villains,
and it all depends on the individual.</p>

<p>Shifters are sometimes called “weretouched”, and they tend to be drawn towards
worship of nature gods or primal spirits.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Shifters are Medium Natural Humanoids, with the “shifter” keyword/subtype. They
have low-light vision and a natural speed of 6, and their signature trait is
<strong>Shifting</strong>.</p>

<p>While bloodied, a shifter can use a minor action to shift, becoming more bestial
in appearance and gaining a few bonuses. There are two different types of
shifting in this book, giving different bonuses: <strong>Razorclaw</strong> shifters gain +2
speed and +1 to AC and Reflex; <strong>Longtooth</strong> shifters gain +2 to damage rolls
and regeneration 2 while bloodied.</p>

<p>All other abilities they might have come from training. You could take stat
blocks for humans and other humanoids and make them into shifters by swapping
their original signature traits with either form of Shifting.</p>

<p>Both stat blocks below are Unaligned, and could be used either as foes or
allies.</p>

<h3 id="longtooth-hunter">Longtooth Hunter</h3>

<p>More of a <em>bounty</em> hunter, really. This Level 6 Soldier has 71 HP, wears mail,
and fights with a longsword and shield. It has speed 5 due to the armor.</p>

<p>Its basic <strong>longsword</strong> attacks also mark for a turn. Once per encounter, it can
use a <strong>Hamstring</strong> maneuver, which allows it to make a basic attack and a
secondary attack vs. Reflex on a hit: if <em>that</em> hits, the target is slowed (save
ends).</p>

<p>When an adjacent enemy shifts, the hunter can shift to follow it as a
reaction. Note the small-s: this is the good old one-square move, not a
transformation.</p>

<p>When bloodied, the hunter Shifts with a capital S and gains the Longtooth
bonuses.</p>

<h3 id="razorclaw-stalker">Razorclaw Stalker</h3>

<p>This Level 7 Skirmisher has 79 HP and Speed 6. It wears leather and wields a
short sword.</p>

<p>The <strong>sword</strong> is used for basic attacks and for <strong>ripostes</strong>, which allow the
stalker to make a basic attack as a free action against anyone who hits it with
an opportunity attack. The stalker also has the <strong>Skirmish</strong> trait, which gives
it a damage bonus if it has moved at least 4 squares from its initial position
before attacking.</p>

<p>When bloodied, it can transform and gain the Razorclaw bonuses.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s one sample encounter: Level 6, 2 longtooth hunters, 1 werewolf, and 2
dire wolves. A nice happy family.</p>

<p>While the stat blocks in this entry are nothing spectacular, they
work. Lore-wise I like shifters a lot, particularly on Eberron.</p>

<p>Shambling mounds are one of D&amp;D’s most enduring plant monsters, being present in
every edition since at least BECMI. Here, they are only on the Monster Manual,
but they got an update in Dungeon 196.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Animated piles of vegetable matter who roam the world’s swamps and marshes,
shambling mounds are carnivores that draw prey into themselves using their
ropelike tendrils. Then they feed by boring countless tiny roots into their
trapped victim’s body.</p>

<p>These creatures are nonsapient, but clever enough to pose as piles of mulch
until suitable prey wanders by. They’re not primarily ambush predators, though -
particularly hungry shambling mounds will go on the hunt.</p>

<p>Shambling mounds are not only immune to electricity, but actually healed by
lightning. I imagine this was a pretty big deal in editions past for those
levels where Lightning Bolt was one of the wizard’s premier attack options. It’s
a bit less of a problem now, except maybe for the party’s storm sorcerer.  This
also suggests the creatures like places where lightning storms are common, such
as monsoon-blasted mangroves right next to those temples guarded by nagas. Sages
speculate that the monsters are actually created when lightning hits a mass of
plant matter in such places, though they don’t know what other factors might be
involved in the process.</p>

<p>Some shambling mound varieties have a further affinity to lightning and are able
to store it in their bodies for use in combat.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Shambling mounds are Large Natural Animates with the Plant keyword. They have
Darkvision and Swamp Walk, some level of Regeneration, and are immune to
lightning damage. They also have a <strong>Lightning Affinity</strong> trait that heals them
for 10 HP whenever they’re hit by a lightning attack.</p>

<p>Aside from a damage update, the stat blocks from Dungeon are identical to the
ones in the MM. We get two shambler stat blocks:</p>

<h3 id="shambling-mound">Shambling Mound</h3>

<p>The classic model is a Level 9 Brute with 120 HP and the standard traits
described above. Its land speed is a plodding 4, but due to Swamp Walk it won’t
be hindered by difficult terrain in its native environment. They have
Regeneration 5.</p>

<p>It attacks with its <strong>tendrils</strong>, and can make an <strong>Enveloping Double Attack</strong>
at will. This allows it to make two basic attacks, and if both hit the same
Medium or smaller target, it makes a further attack against their Fortitude.</p>

<p>A hit on that one pulls the target into the shambling mound! While in there, the
victim is restrained and no other creature has line of sight or effect to it. At
the start of the mound’s turns, those tiny boring roots drain the victim’s
blood, dealing 10 damage and restoring 10 HP to the mound. Up to two such
victims can be caught in this way. All of this is (save ends).</p>

<p>A shambler with 2 victims inside heals 25 HP per turn! And since no one has line
of effect to the victim, those cleric powers that allow free saves don’t work on
them - they have to roll a natural save to escape, or have access to those save
powers themselves. The Restrained condition would still allow them to attack at
a penalty, but that same “no line of effect” clause means they can’t attack the
shambler.</p>

<h3 id="stormrage-shambler">Stormrage Shambler</h3>

<p>This is the one with batteries included. Stormrage Shamblers are Level 11 Elite
Controllers with 238 HP and the standard traits listed above. Their land speed
is a brisk 8, still with Swamp Walk. They have Regeneration 10.</p>

<p>These shamblers project a <strong>Lightning Aura</strong> 2 that deal lighning damage to
those enemies caught inside.</p>

<p>Like the basic model, they also fight with their <strong>tendrils</strong> and can make
<strong>Double Attacks</strong>, but don’t have the enveloping mechanics. Instead, the
tendril attacks deal extra lightning damage when they’re bloodied. They can also
fire a <strong>Lightning Blast</strong> once per encounter (Close Blast 3 vs. Reflex), which
obviously do a bunch of lightning damage, half on a miss.</p>

<p>They still have Lighning Affinity, with the added note that they can’t use it to
heal themselves.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s one sample encounter: Level 9, 1 shambling mound, 3 assorted vine
horrors, and 2 dryads. In Soviet Nerath, salad eats you.</p>

<p>I like shambling mounds! Don’t think I ever used one, but I should really remedy
that. The standard model is a bit more dangerous than its level implies, since
there are few ways to grant extra saves to an enveloped victim and the extra
healing they provide can make the fight last longer.</p>
