<p>I think rot harbingers first appeared in 3e as Angels of Decay, in one of its
undead-focused supplements. Here, they are only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In 4e, rot harbingers are still sometimes called angels of decay, though that’s
the less common name for them. Though they resemble angels, the two are not
directly related.</p>

<p>Rot harbingers are one a type of undead that were never alive in the first
place. Once upon a time Orcus decided to travel outside the Abyss for reasons
that have been lost to time. The gods took this opportunity to try and kill him,
and sent a host of angels to do the deed. The angels failed, and all of them
perished at the claws of the demon lord. When Orcus returned to the Abyss, he
made the first rot harbingers from nothing as a kind of “fuck you” to the gods
that tried to kill him.</p>

<p>Most such monsters still serve Orcus, but some have managed to escape his
control and find new employment with other masters. All of them are quite
unpleasant, with their lust for inflicting agony and death being literally the
thing that keeps them animate.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Rot harbingers are Medium Elemental Humanoids with the Undead keyword. They’re
immune to disease and poison, have 10 necrotic resistance, and aren’t specially
vulnerable to radiant energy. They run at speed 6 and fly at speed 8
(clumsy). We get two stat blocks here, and they’re simple enough that I’m not
going to give them their own sub-sections.</p>

<p>The standard <strong>Rot Harbinger</strong> is a level 20 soldier with 193 HP. It fights with
its claws, which mark for a turn and do ongoing necrotic damage (save ends) in
addition to their standard physical damage. That’s their only attack.</p>

<p>There’s also the <strong>Rot Slinger</strong>, which is level 22 Artillery and has 165
HP. Its claws also do ongoing necrotic damage, and it fights at range by
shooting Orbs of Decay (Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) which do necrotic damage,
weaken, and inflict a -2 penalty to saves (save ends both).</p>

<p>They’re best used in groups, with standard harbingers providing a serviceable
front line and the slingers hanging back. They pair well with monsters that
inflict (save ends) effects, due to the penalty they inflict.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h3>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 21: 1 deathpriest hierophant, 3 slaughter wights, and 2 rot harbingers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 2 harbingers, 2 slingers, and a voidsoul specter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, Thanatos is probably crawling with these things, and they make
perfect servants to high level necromancer types even if those necromancers
aren’t part of the Orcus franchise. They’re good candidates for the “regular
foot-soldier” monster in an all-undead epic adventure.</p>

<p>Ropers are D&amp;D originals as far as I know, and have been in the game since at
least AD&amp;D first edition. They’re one of a number of monsters meant to look like
innocuous bits of scenery which Gygax and other authors likely invented as their
players became savvy to their usual opposition. They’re on both the Monster
Manual and the Vault in this edition.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Ropers are ambush predators who live in the Underdark and sometimes in caves
closer to the surface. Their rocky skin and conical shape makes them very
similar to the sort of geological formation you can find in these environments,
and they can slowly crawl and position themselves in either cavern floors or
ceilings. Unlike many Underdark denizens, their distant origins lie in the
Elemental Chaos rather than in the Far Realm. They’re technically earth
elementals!</p>

<p>A roper will sit tight and look like a stalactite/stalagmite until some likely
prey wanders into the reach of its long tentacles, at which point they’ll whip
out, grab the victim, and pull them into the creature’s maw. Aside from their
natural camouflage and weapons, ropers have another thing going for them:
they’re sapient and actually fairly intelligent. While most will eat anything
and anyone, some have specific tastes in prey, such as humans or elves.</p>

<p>In both cases, a roper might make deals with other creatures that live near its
chosen hunting grounds, promising not to eat them in exchange for being allowed
to position itself at a prime spot in their territory. If that territory gets
invaded (either by one of the many hostile Underdark factions or by PCs), the
roper and its allies will generally cooperate in its defense, with the roper
getting to eat the bodies later.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Ropers are Large Elemental Magical Beasts with the Earh keyword. They all have
darkvision and are immune to petrification. They have ground and climb speeds of
only 2, with Spider Climb allowing them to stick to ceilings. This means they’re
not going to be moving much during a fight, but they can position themselves
just fine outside of it.</p>

<p>All ropers can do something grabby with their tentacles and something horrible
to grabbed victims, but the exact mechanics vary per stat block. Tentacles
usually have a fantastic melee reach of 10.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual only has the one roper stat block, but the MV has
three. We’ll look at them in order of level.</p>

<h3 id="impaling-roper-mv">Impaling Roper (MV)</h3>

<p>A relatively simple creature compared to its relatives, the Impaling Roper is a
Level 10 Lurker with 84 HP and the standard traits described above. It’s trained
in Stealth.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Tentacles</strong> (melee 10 vs. Reflex) do very little damage, but also grab on
a hit (escape DC 26). Grabbing a victim grants the roper Resist 20 to all of
that victim’s attacks for a turn. Anyone (including the victim) can attack the
grabbing tentacle, which has the same defenses as the roper. A hit here does no
damage but causes the creature to release the victim.</p>

<p>If the victim is still grabbed when the roper’s next turn comes up, it can
<strong>Impale</strong> them (melee 10 vs. Reflex). A hit pulls the victim adjacent to the
roper, does a ton of physical damage, and ends the grab. A miss does the same
thing, but only half damage.</p>

<p>I’m guessing this roper looks more like a round spiky rock than the usual
conical shape.</p>

<h3 id="cave-roper-mv">Cave Roper (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 12 Elite Controller with 252 HP and all standard roper
traits. It’s pretty much the classic roper.</p>

<p>Cave ropers have a couple of passive traits: <strong>Tentacle Release</strong> is the same
“attack the tentacle to free a victim” mechanic we had as part of the Impaling
Roper’s basic attack. <strong>Stony Body</strong> is what allows the roper to disguise itself
as a rocky formation by closing its eye and retracting its tentacles. The
Perception DC for spotting the ruse is 28.</p>

<p>The roper’s <strong>Tentacles</strong> (melee 10 vs. reflex) do level-appopriate damage and
grab the target with a DC 20 escape DC. While grabbed, the target is also
weakened. With <strong>Double Attack</strong> it can make two tentacle attacks in an action.</p>

<p>They can also <strong>Bite</strong> an adjacent grabbed victim, an attack vs. AC that does a
ton of damage on a hit and half that on a miss. This roper’s bites <em>don’t</em> end
the grab.</p>

<p>To bring those victims within bite range, the roper can use minor actions to
<strong>Reel</strong> them in, an attack vs. Fortitude that pulls the victim 5 squares on a
hit.</p>

<h3 id="roper-mm">Roper (MM)</h3>

<p>The Monster Manual roper is a Level 14 Elite Controller with 284 HP. It’s
functionally identical to the Cave Roper above, with the main differences being
from mechanical adjustments between books. The DC to spot its Sony Body disguise
is 30, and since there’s no listed DC to escape is grabs, you have to use either
its Fortitude of 29 or its Reflex of 21 depending no which skill you choose.</p>

<p>There’s nothing here you can’t get in a better format by leveling up a cave
roper to level 14.</p>

<h3 id="crag-roper-mv">Crag Roper (MV)</h3>

<p>Crag Ropers are Level 15 Elite Soldiers with 304 HP. They have all the standard
traits mentioned above, plus the usual Stony Body (DC 30 to spot). They also get
a <strong>Lashing Tentacles</strong> aura 5 to support their soldierly role: any enemy inside
is considered marked.</p>

<p>I think there might be some mistake in the crag roper’s attacks. Their
<strong>tentacles</strong> skip the grabbing mechanics and just pull the target 5 squares in
addition to doing damage. However, their <strong>bites</strong> can only target grabbed
targets, and they have a <strong>Reel</strong> ability, both of which work like the cave
roper’s. They can also make two tentacle attacks per action.</p>

<p>As written, the crag roper has a hard time using either Reel or its bite, since
it has to resort to a generic, damage-less grab action to grab someone. I would
suggest either replacing the pull effect from the tentacles with a grab, or
removing both Reel and the targetting restriction from the bite, making it into
a Melee 1 attack with the same stats and effects.</p>

<p>The crag roper’s final attack is <strong>Tentacled Retaliation</strong>, a reaction that
triggers when a marked enemy tries to ignore the roper’s mark and attack someone
else. It gives the monster a free tentacle attack against the enemy.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions.</h2>

<p>We have two level 14 encounters in the MM, one with a roper collaborating with a
mind flayer and its two war troll thralls, and one with a drow war party. This
tells us ropers will work with anyone who gives them a good deal, and have no
specific allegiance to any of the big Underdark factions.</p>

<p>Ropers are fine, I suppose, but I never really saw them as the sort of monster
that absolutely must be present in a book. Even though I kinda get the editorial
intention of the Monster Vault, I’m still a bit baffled as to why it dedicates
so much space to the roper as opposed to, say, fomorians, which are not present
here at all.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/10/27/stormtrooper-armor.html">The Stormtrooper Armor Conundrum</a>

            <p>Do you know what is the second hardest thing to convert when adapting Star Wars
to the tabletop? Stormtroopers<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. From an in-character perspective they vastly
outnumber and outgun the scrappy rebel protagonists, with deadly blaster
carbines and that iconic heavy armor. Yet in the actual narrative they almost
never hit a shot and always get taken out in one hit from one of the heroes.</p>

<p>Their poor aim has actually made it into GURPS as an optional cinematic rule
named “Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy”, which reduces the deadliness
of enemy shooters. But the armor thing has tied people’s brain in knots, because
it can’t be explained away with a joke. Why does their armor do nothing?</p>

<p>There are almost as many explanations and solutions to this as there are Star
Wars adaptations. Some say “all armor is bad, actually” and have PCs rely on
plot protection. Some have an armor system but go out of their way to explain
why trooper suits specifically are actually bad. And some have an armor system
that rates trooper armor highly but then go on to state that fun shootouts from
the movies are lies and legends.</p>

<p>Me, I think I hit on a solution that allows me to keep those fun fights while
still having armor be cool.</p>

<h2 id="imperial-stormtrooper-armor-drills">Imperial Stormtrooper Armor Drills</h2>

<p>This is a cinematic rule meant for science fiction settings where highly
effective armor is common, but you want the PCs to have fun battles against
armies of heavily-armored mooks. Star Wars and stormtroopers are the most
obvious examples, but it also works for settings such as Waframe’s with its
Grineer soldiers.</p>

<p>Under this rule, armor worn by “mook” or “fodder” enemies has no protective
value, and is mostly a cosmetic detail! Any solid hit will take them down,
regardless of whether it would have penetrated their DR under standard
rules. Armor worn by PCs and other important characters still uses all the
default rules.</p>

<p>This allows you to frame a particularly badass trooper as a real threat and have
them survive several attacks without giving them different protective gear. It
also allows PCs to loot armor from a fallen mook and have it actually provide
benefit beyond a temporary disguise.</p>

<p>Optionally, you could perhaps take this a bit further and subject certain
stormtroopers to the Inverse Ninja Rule. See a full platoon of troopers gunning
for you? Easy. See <em>one</em> trooper approaching? Danger!</p>

<p>I first heard of Rocs in the Arabian Nights stories (where Sinbad meets one). In
D&amp;D, they’ve been a thing at least since 1st Edition. Here, they are only on the
Monster Manual along with some other familiar monsters.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>“Roc” here refers to a large group of related creatures, all of which are
gigantic birds of prey with ties to the Elemental Chaos. They’re non-sapient
beasts, and behave much like their mundane counterparts but on a larger scale.</p>

<p>Giants love rocs, and often train for use as pets and companions. This is one of
the rare cases where the giant’s pet is larger than the giant itself - all rocs
are Huge, which means their size is about that of a full-grown titan.</p>

<p>The Common Roc is the one you’ve probably read about in the Sinbad story. An
extremely large eagle-like bird that nests in mountains and flies out to hunt
cattle or similar prey. Despite their size they can be trained even by
non-giants, and for this reason their eggs sell on the open market for a
whopping 10,000 gp. Even with such a high price, few people feel it’s worth the
risk to try and steal some roc eggs. You have to find the nest, get to it, and
figure out a way to bring one or more fifty-kilo eggs home intact without momma
roc spotting you.</p>

<p>Common rocs technically have elemental ancestry, but they’ve been in the world
for so long they’ve become a part of it, much like hill giants. Their relatives
are another story.</p>

<p>For starters, 4e phoenixes are a type of roc! Made of solid fire, they have an
inexplicable hatred of undead despite being beasts, and are famous for their
ability to self-immolate and be reborn from their own ashes. When a phoenix dies
it might also leave behind a single scarlet feather (which is not made of
fire). It can be used as a component of the Raise Dead ritual, allowing the
caster to ignore its usual limitations: they can bring back someone who died up
to a year ago, or grant 1 year of life to someone who died from old age.</p>

<p>Yeah, you heard that right, Phoenix Down is a thing. The book implies it’s only
left behind by phoenixes when they die <em>permanently</em>, but if you want them to be
a bit more common you could say it also happens even if they rise from the
ashes.</p>

<p>You also have Thunderhawks, which are storm-themed rocs whose beaks and claws
are infused with lightning, and who have some power over the wind around
them. Storm giants love these things, and train them as a sport much like a
human noble would train standard-sized falcons. Unlike a standard sized falcon,
they’re quite useful in battle as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>All rocs are Huge Beasts, with the common variety being Natural and the others
Elemental. They all hop along at speed 4 on the ground, and fly at
speed 10. They have trained Perception but no special ability to see in the
dark, being daytime hunters. An owl roc with darkvision would be hella cool but
is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>As usual for higher-level MM monsters, their damage is quite lower than it’s
supposed to be and should be fixed if you intend to use them.</p>

<h3 id="common-roc">Common Roc</h3>

<p>Common rocs (or just “Rocs”) are Level 14 Elite Skirmishers with 288 HP and
standard traits. Their flight speed is tagged as clumsy, but that looks like an
error to me given their main attack.</p>

<p>A roc’s basic attack is its Reach 2 <strong>bite</strong>, but what it really likes to do is
a <strong>Claw Snatch</strong>. This maneuver allows the roc to fly its speed and make an
attack vs. Reflex against a Medium or smaller target at any point in the
movement. This does a little less damage than the beak, but a hit also grabs the
target. The roc then flies the rest of its movement and drops the target prone
on a space adjacent to its final position.</p>

<p>Now, with Claw Snatch it’s important to remember that diagonals are free in 4e
movement. A flying roc that has just grabbed a target can climb 1 square for
every square of horizontal movement it makes from that point on. So, when it
drops the target at the end of the movement, they’re going to take falling
damage. And if the fight happens as the party climbs a mountain intent on
stealing some roc eggs, there will be lots and lots of cliffs and precipices
around for Momma to drop the PCs into.</p>

<p>The size limitation being Medium doesn’t quite fit with the information that
rocs hunt horses and cattle (which are Large). It’s an easy thing to change and
shouldn’t impact fights much, since there are no Large PCs. It does mean the
bird could lift a mounted PC with its mount, though.</p>

<h3 id="phoenix">Phoenix</h3>

<p>Phoenixes are Level 19 Elite Brutes with 300 HP. This number is a little low,
particularly when compared to the common roc’s total above, but that’s because a
third of the phoenix’s total HP is hidden behind a gimmick, which we’ll see
soon. They have 20 fire resistance, and <strong>Fiery Body</strong> aura 1 that deals 10 fire
damage to peole who start their turns inside.</p>

<p>The phoenix’s <strong>bite</strong> is reach 2 and does physical damage with some ongoing
fire damage (save ends). It can also use a <strong>Radiant Burst</strong> (close burst 5
vs. Reflex, recharge 6) that does radiant damage and dazes.</p>

<p>When first bloodied, the phoenix triggers its gimmick: <strong>Immolation</strong>. This
causes an explosion (close burst 2 vs. reflex) that does fire damage, and kills
the phoenix. At the end of its next turn, it rises from the ashes at full
HP. This means phoenixes effectively have 450 HP. Immolation is a daily ability,
so if the phoenix continues fighting after this it can be permanently killed in
the usual way.</p>

<h3 id="thunderhawk">Thunderhawk</h3>

<p>Thunderhawks are Level 22 Elite Soldiers with 420 HP. They have 20 resistance to
lightning and thunder, which does indeed make them the ideal storm giant pets.</p>

<p>Their attacks are simple. The usual basic <strong>bite</strong> is reach 2 and does a mix of
physical and lightning damage, with extra bonus thunder damage when used in a
charge. As a minor action, they can cause a <strong>wind rush</strong> (close burst 2
vs. fortitude) that does no damage but knocks prone on a hit.</p>

<p>So after an initial charge, the thunderhawk will keep hovering just above its
enemies, keeping everyone prone so its buddies can move in for the kill and
biting as appopriate.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encoutners-and-final-impressions">Sample Encoutners and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have one sample encounter for each bird. You’re not really expected to fight
them by themselves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: 1 roc, 2 hill giants, 2 galeb durh rockcallers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 19: 1 phoenix, 3 assorted fire archons. It’s only undead they hate -
fire elementals might still tame them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 2 thunderhawks and 2 bralanis of autumn winds. It’s not just storm
giants!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m a little surprised to see all big birbs share the same entry, but it makes
sense. I liked the common roc’s “drag and drop” ability, and thunderhawks are
cooler than I expected from my initial glance at their small stat block.</p>

<p>The phoenix is a bit weirder. I’d expect its immolation-and-resurrection act to
happen when it hit 0 HP, not its bloodied value. I guess they didn’t do that
because it would require a bigger exception (“the phoneix has 225 HP and no
bloodied value”), but it doesn’t stop you from doing it in your home game if you
wish. Not having a bloodied value is itself a kind if minor defensive ability,
since it denies some PC their bonuses against bloodied enemies.</p>

<p>Rats have of course been in the game since its beginnings. They have an entry of
their own in the Monster Manual and are present in the animal appendix in the
Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Rats are real world animals and have been historically reviled both for their
propensity for eating people’s food stores and for carrying disease. That last
one is something of an undeserved reputation, as the worst diseases are actually
carried by fleas and not by the rats themselves.</p>

<p>Calling someone a “rat” is usually an insult implying cowardice, selfishness,
and treachery, and D&amp;D tends to ascribe these traits to rat-like
monsters. Rats themselves are such a classic staple of low-level D&amp;D play that
they’re a bit cliche. “Clearing rats from a basement” was used as the tutorial
quest for so many D&amp;D-like video-games that the phrase has come to mean
“trivial, boring and predictable adventure” on the tabletop.</p>

<p>In 4e, individual mundane rats are pretty much harmless to an adventurer, but
they can be somewhat dangerous in large numbers, forming swarms which are likely
more aggressive than their real-world counterparts. This being D&amp;D, rats also
come in Giant and Dire varieties, and these are indeed a lot bigger and more
dangerous than their real-world counterparts.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Between both books we have no less than 5 rat-related stat blocks! Some of them
are conceptually equivalent, but different enough that I think they’re worth
discussing separately.</p>

<p>All rats are Natural Beasts, possess low-light vision, and have a climb speed.</p>

<h3 id="rat-swarm-mm">Rat Swarm (MM)</h3>

<p>A swarm of mundane rats is a Level 2 Skirmisher with 36 HP. As a swarm it takes
half damage from single-target attacks and 5 extra damage from AoEs. It also has
a Swarm Attack aura 1 that allows it to make a basic against any enemies who
starts their turn inside. The swarm moves at speed 4 and climbs at speed 2.</p>

<p>Their only attack is a <strong>Swarm of Teeth</strong> that deals immediate and ongoing
physical damage (save ends).</p>

<p>Realistically I think a rat swarm would be more interested in running away than
fighting human-sized opponents, but this is D&amp;D! Maybe someone is controlling
them, or maybe they’re just plain mean. A swarm intent on fighting will likely
park itself in a PC’s space and let the aura do most of the work, while using
their standard attacks to put extra pressure on a specific PC.</p>

<p>They’re less dangerous than needlefang drake swarms because they can’t knock
people down, but are otherwise a good example of a basic swarm monster.</p>

<h3 id="scurrying-rat-swarm-mv">Scurrying Rat Swarm (MV)</h3>

<p>While conceptually the same monster than the MM Rat Swarm, this entry has a
completely different stat block.</p>

<p>This rat swarm is a Level 1 Skirmisher with 27 HP and a ground speed of 6 (climb
speed is still 2). It has the standard swarm resistance/vulnerabilities, and a
Swarm trait in its stat block that helpfully summarizes the other rules it
follows.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura 1 does a bit of automatic damage and slides enemies
inside 1 square. The <strong>Swarm of Teeth</strong> basic attack does more base damage, and
does extra damage if the rats moved at least 2 squares this turn.</p>

<p>This results in a rather more skirmisher-y monster that will keep running around
for the damage bonuses rather than parking itself somewhere. Opportunity attacks
are a minor concern for it, because it’s going to take half damage from most of
them.</p>

<h3 id="giant-rat-mm">Giant Rat (MM)</h3>

<p>Big enough to be a threat all by themselves, giant rats are Small in size,
though probably on the smaller side of that. They’re Level 1 Minion Brutes with
a speed of 6 (climb 3) and a basic bite attack that does “minion” damage. That’s
all!</p>

<p>In practice you’ll still want to use a “swarm” of them, only now you’re tracking
each rat individually. They’re about equivalent to the classic giant rats of
editions past, which had like 1/4 HD.</p>

<h3 id="dire-rat-both">Dire Rat (Both)</h3>

<p>Dire Rats are even bigger than giant ones, and have that spiky aesthetic common
to all D&amp;D dire animals. They’re aggressive enough to actively start fights with
the PCs even when they’re not cornered, and unlike their less terrible
counterparts they <em>do</em> spread nasty diseases directly. There’s some disagreement
as to their size category: the MM says Medium, the MV says Small. Either way
we’re well into Rodent of Unusual Size country. Their speed is 6 (climb 2).</p>

<p>These beasts are simple Level 1 Brutes with 38 HP. Their only attack is a basic
<strong>bite</strong> that does physical damage and spreads Level 1 Filth Fever. As usual for
disease-vector monsters, infection is automatic under MM rules, and only happens
if you fail a save after the combat under MV rules.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is level 3: 2 kobold slingers, 2 rat swarms and 3 dire
rats.</p>

<p>So yeah, if you were wondering who would train attack rats, there you have
it. Kobolds do it, and goblins certainly do it too since they’re supposed to be
adept beastmasters. Dire rats also tend to obey wererats.</p>

<p>I was never a rat enthusiast, and these stat blocks don’t sway my opinion. At
the same time, I guess I’d feel like something was missing if the monster book
didn’t have rats. The MV versions are slightly better, though there’s not much
difference in damage for level 1 monsters.</p>
