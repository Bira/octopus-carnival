<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Lizardfolk have been in D&amp;D since its beginnings, when they were known by the
less inclusive name of “lizard men”. As members of the classic humanoid power
ladder, they are present in both books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Lizardfolk are reptilian humanoids who prefer to live in hot, humid environments
like jungles and swamps, where they establish hunter-gatherer societies. They
are naturally adept swimmers and can hold their breaths for up to ten minutes.</p>

<p>Lizardfolk hatch from eggs and reach physical maturity in 2 years. All of a
village’s eggs are buried in a communal pit for incubation, and the hatchlings
are raised by the tribe as a whole. Lizardfolk culture has no concept of
parenthood or nuclear families.</p>

<p>Their society is patriarchal, with the most powerful male acting as chieftain
advised by shamans and mystics. They don’t worship any deities, but a truly
legendary chieftain may be elevated to the status of “Lizard King” and be
treated as a living god. I think the concept of primal spirits wasn’t 100%
developed at this time, but lizard-people should probably be a primary example
of a culture that worships them more than the gods.</p>

<p>Older editions described lizardfolk as murderous cannibals, but the Monster
Manual lore seems to be considerably nicer. Lizardfolk tribes are territorial
and insular, but usually not malicious. They even trade with those outsiders who
manage to win their trust (most often halflings). Some communities on the other
hand <em>are</em> malicious and practice both raiding and cannibalism. Those don’t
trade with anyone.</p>

<p>There are several different lizardfolk “ethnicities”. The most common are known
as “greenscales”, of average build. You also have the stronger and larger
“blackscales”, and the MV also introduces us to the smaller and faster
“poisonscales”. All three can either form their own communities, or live
together in a single village.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault lore has absolutely nothing nice to say about lizardfolk, by
the way. This seems to be a trend in that book when it comes to humanoids. The
MV goes right back to Basic’s line about all lizardfolk being murderous
cannibals who don’t even build their own villages if they can instead slaughter
a “civilized” community and take their houses.</p>

<p>In either case, lizardfolk hunt and fight by employing their superior knowledge
of their territory, and the superior mobility they enjoy therein. They often use
nets or poison darts, and will try to lure invaders into traps or natural
hazards (like quicksand pits or hungry crocodiles).</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Poisonscales and Greenscales are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Reptile
keyword. Blackscales are Large. They all have Speed 6 with Swamp Walk, ignoring
all swamp-like difficult terrain.</p>

<p>MV lizardfolk tend to have an atavistic theme going on, gaining minor-action
“feral” attacks when they become bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="poisonscale-needler-mv">Poisonscale Needler (MV)</h3>

<p>Needlers are Level 3 Minion Artillery with the common traits outlined
above. They fight in melee with claws, and at range with blowguns. The
blowgun darts do poison damage, and on a critical hit cause the target to fall
unconscious (save ends).</p>

<p>They also have the <strong>Sniper</strong> trait, which make a needler that misses a ranged
attack from hiding remain hidden.</p>

<h3 id="poisonscale-brawler-mv">Poisonscale Brawler (MV)</h3>

<p>These are Level 3 Brutes with 55 HP and all common lizardfolk traits.</p>

<p>Their main weapon is a club, and they can perform a Feral Grab as a 1/round
minor action. This targets Reflex, does no damage, and grabs on a hit (escape DC
13). Brawlers can apply a Crushing Grasp to grabbed victims, targetting
Fortitude and doing more damage than the club (half on a miss).</p>

<h3 id="greenscale-raider-mv">Greenscale Raider (MV)</h3>

<p>These are Level 3 Soldiers with 45 HP. Their club attacks mark for a turn, and
they can attack marked targets who shift as a reaction, doing more damage than
the basic attack (half on a miss).</p>

<p>Once bloodied, they can also attack with minor-action tail sweeps (vs. Reflex),
which do no damage but knock the target prone on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="greenscale-trapper-mv">Greenscale Trapper (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 3 Controller with 46 HP, and a rare non-spellcasting controller
at that. It carries a spear and three nets into combat.</p>

<p>Aside from basic spear attacks, the trapper can toss a net (Close Blast 2
vs. Reflex; enemies only) to do a bit of damage and immobilize (save ends). On a
miss, it can still slide the target 1 square to a square not in the blast. You
dodge, but end up right where the trapper wanted you!</p>

<p>As a move action, the trapper can use Net Drag, moving its speed and pulling any
targets immobilized by its net along. Once bloodied, it can perform a Feral Kick
(vs. Reflex) as a minor action, which does no damage but slides the target 1
square on a hit.</p>

<h3 id="greenscale-hunter-mm-and-raider-mv">Greenscale Hunter (MM) and Raider (MV)</h3>

<p>Different versions of the same monster, these are Level 4 Skirmishers with 54
HP. They fight with spears and can shift 1 square before attacking with
them. The Hunter gets a minor-action Feral Tail Lash when bloodied, which on a
hit deals a smidge of damage and allows the hunter to shift 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="greenscale-darter-mm">Greenscale Darter (MM)</h3>

<p>A nonminion version of the Needler. These are Level 5 Lurkers with 50 HP. They
fight with clubs in melee. Their blowgun attacks do a single point of physical
damage and trigger a secondary attack vs. Fortitude. If that one hits, the
target takes 5 ongoing poison damage and is slowed (save ends).</p>

<p>You should probably change the blowgun to do level-appropriate poison damage
instead if you update them.</p>

<p>They also have the Sniper trait.</p>

<h3 id="greenscale-bogmarsh-mystic-both">Greenscale Bog/Marsh Mystic (Both)</h3>

<p>Lizardfolk spellcasters, likely primal. The one in the MV is named the Bog
Mystic, and the one in the MM is the Marsh Mystic. They’re Level 6 Controllers
(Leaders) with 70 HP and all common lizardfolk traits.</p>

<p>The Marsh Mystic has an aura named <strong>Marsh Blessing</strong> with a radius of 5
squares. Allies inside heal 3 HP at the start of their turns. The Bog Mystic
replaces that with <strong>Swamp Tangle</strong>, which has the same radius. Whenever an
enemy inside is hit by an attack, the aura’s squares become difficult terrain
for them for a turn.</p>

<p>Their other attacks are equivalent. They fight with spears in melee, and at
range with a spell named <strong>Bog Cloud</strong> (Area Burst 2 within 10 vs. Fortitude;
recharge 5-6). This does poison damage and dazes for a turn. The MV version
still makes the targets grant combat advantage for a turn on a miss.</p>

<p>The mystic’s ultimate technique is <strong>Swamp’s Grasp</strong>, an encounter power whose
mechanical effects differ between versions. In both it’s an area burst 2 that
targets Reflex and represents swamp vegeration heaving up to entangle
victims. The MM version has a range of 10, does no damage, and immobilizes (save
ends). The MV version is a lot better, doing damage in addition to the
immobilize effect, or half damage and slow (save ends) on a miss. It only has
range 5, though.</p>

<p>In both cases, Swamp’s Grasp creates a zone of difficult terrain until the end
of the encounter, which can be ignored by creatures with swamp walk.</p>

<p>Finally the MV mystic has a Feral Tail Lash that can be used once it’s bloodied,
does a bit of damage, and slows for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="blackscale-bruiser-mm-and-crusher-mv">Blackscale Bruiser (MM) and Crusher (MV)</h3>

<p>This Large lizard-person is a straightforward Level 6 Brute with 86 HP. The
Bruiser fights with a club whose attacks damage and can push targets 1 square,
and with tail slaps that target Reflex, do damage, and knock prone.</p>

<p>The Crusher has the same club attack but its other options are a little
fancier. Its Tail Swipe can be used twice per encounter, recharging when the
creature is bloodied. It’s a Close Blast 2 vs. Reflex that does a goodly bit of
damage and knocks targets prone.</p>

<p>Once bloodied it can also use Feral Bites as a minor action, which do more
damage than the other “feral” attacks we saw but have no riders.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have 2 here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 2 greenscale hunters, 2 visejaw crocodiles, 1 vine horror. A sampler
of the pets lizardfolk keep.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 1 mystic, 2 bruisers, 1 darter, 2 hunters. Either a serious hunting
party or the mystic’s personal guard.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Mechanics-wise the MV stat blocks are almost always better, particularly the
ones for mystics and bruisers. However, I’m 100% behind the MM’s non-xenophobic
lore. Neutral lizardfolk who might trade and talk with you are a much better
addition to a setting than yet another Angry Humanoid.</p>

<p>Lichs are the original horrible undead wizards of D&amp;D, having existed since
the beginning. They’re both in the 4e Monster Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A lich is a spellcaster, usually a wizard or warlock, who has performed an
unspeakably evil ritual to become undead while retaining all of their intellect
and magical power. Several liches have been successful enough that their names
are known throughout existence. There’s Vlaakith, the supreme ruler of the
githyanki; Acecerak, whose disembodied soul wanders the planes; and of course
Vecna, who became a god.</p>

<p>All liches are evil. In life, they were at the very least ambitious individuals
with an insatiable lust for both temporal and magical power. While someone can
technically possess these traits without being evil, the stuff they have to do
as part of the ritual, as well as the process itself, will inevitably warp their
alignment that way.</p>

<p>Most such greedy wizards become liches to cheat death. They start to search the
world and the planes for lore that allows them to piece together the ritual as
soon as they realize they’re not going to live long enough to conquer the entire
universe. Sure, death is not the end in D&amp;D, but it usually means losing your
stuff and for some wizards that’s worse than oblivion. I imagine these
spellcasters make an effort to erase any knowledge of this ritual after they
find it to prevent future competition, but somehow the next lich candidate
always manages to find their own copy.</p>

<p>Liches are a lot more patient about their schemes than they were in life - they
now have the whole of eternity to work them. Their goal remains to accumulate as
much power and knowledge as possible, and now they have absolutely no moral
qualms about the methods used for this (if they ever had any before). Lots of
evil creatures serve liches willingly because they like to bask in their utter
depravity.</p>

<p>Liches tend to be security conscious (read: paranoid), because their immortal
forms can still be destroyed through violence. They’ll rarely leave their
fortified lairs, sending lackeys to further their schemes when possible. A
Lich’s soul is anchored in a phylactery, which is usually a tiny metal box
filled with arcane writings, but can also be any other small item. The
phylactery ensures a destroyed lich will re-materialize in a few days. The
security arrangements around phylacteries are even more elaborate and dangerous
than those around the lich itself, and can tell you a lot about the personality
of the lich in question.</p>

<p>Destroying a lich requires destroying the philactery first, and then the lich
itself. You have to be fast about it, because the lich can build itself another
philactery in a few days. Sometimes, not even this is enough: a powerful entity
associated with undeath such as Orcus or Vecna can call a destroyed lich back
into existence as a vestige. Orcus is the original architect of lichdom, and
nearly all liches are his agents in the end. I imagine this doesn’t apply to
Vecna, and that the demon lord has competition in this area now.</p>

<p>Fifth Edition would add that liches need to regularly consume souls to keep
existing, but this is absent from the text here. Their all-consuming greed and
ambition is enough reason for them to keep inflicting evil upon the world.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>First off, we get stats for the Lich Transformation ritual! It’s level 14,
requires training in Arcana or Religion, takes 1 hour, and costs 100,000gp in
components. A market price of 250,000gp for the formula is also listed because
that’s the standard format for rituals, but this is definitely not something you
can find in most markets. Maybe there’s a kiosk in Orcus’ abyssal layer or
Vecna’s domain that sells it, if you want to be cute about it.</p>

<p>Constructing the philactery is a separate process that takes 10 days - the 1
hour ritual casting time is just the final step that kills you and makes you a
lich. Phylacteries are tough, with 40hp and resist 20 to all damage. The cost
for the first one is included in the ritual’s casting cost. Replacements take
another 10 days to build and cost 50,000gp. Feel free to include any amount of
baby-eating you require to mark this whole process (both building and casting)
as irredeemably evil.</p>

<p>Early in 4e, “Lich” is a monster template presented in the DMG, which the
Monster Manual applies to a “Human Necromancer” and an “Eladrin Wizard” stat
block. By the time the Monster Vault had been written those templates had fallen
out of favor, so its stat blocks are built from scratch while observing the same
themes.</p>

<p>On to the stat blocks!</p>

<h3 id="lich-human-necromancer-mm">Lich (Human Necromancer) (MM)</h3>

<p>This is a Medium Natural Humanoid (undead) and a Level 14 Elite Controller with
218 HP (MM). It has Speed 6, Darkvision, Resist 10 Necrotic, and immunity to
disease and poison. It also has Regeneration 10, which can be turned off for a
turn by radiant damage.</p>

<p>This lich surrounded by a <strong>Necromantic Aura</strong> with a radius of 5 squares, which
deals 5 necrotic damage to anyone caught inside. Against civilians with 1 HP,
this is a weapon of mass destruction all by itself, though few liches would be
murderous enough to use it in that way.</p>

<p>Its active powers are weird in that it entirely lacks a melee basic attack. This
is likely an editorial oversight. Instead it has a ranged basic attack named
<strong>Shadow Ray</strong> (Ranged 20 vs. Reflex) which does necrotic damage.</p>

<p>Every once in a while the lich can use <strong>Frostburn</strong> (Area Burst 2 Within 20
vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6), which does cold and necrotic damage and creates a
zone that deals another 10 cold and necrotic damage to anyone caught
inside. This lasts a turn and can be sustained as a minor action.</p>

<p>A lich reduced to 0 HP will crumble to dust along with its possessions, and both
will reform adjacent to its phylactery in 1d10 days. This can be stopped by
destroying the phylactery.</p>

<p>Finally, it can use the Second Wind action to recover 54 HP and get +2 to
defenses for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="lich-necromancer-mv">Lich Necromancer (MV)</h3>

<p>The updated version of the messy lich above. This one is also a Level 14 Elite
Controller, with 268 HP and no Second Wind. It has the same speed, senses,
immunities, resistances and vulnerabilities but no regeneration.</p>

<p>The <strong>Necromantic Aura</strong> remains and works the same way, as does the
phylactery. Its active abilities are a lot more interesting.</p>

<p>The lich attacks in melee with a <strong>Vampiric Touch</strong> (vs. Fortitude) that deals
necrotic damage and heals the lich for the same amount. Its ranged attack is
<strong>Freezing Claw</strong> (Ranged 5 vs. Reflex; one or two creatures) that deals cold
and necrotic and immobilizes on a hit (save ends); on a miss, it does no damage
and slows (save ends).</p>

<p>Its big attack is <strong>Enervating Tendrils</strong> (Area Burst 1 within 10
vs. Fortitude), a tentacular explosion that deals a bunch of necrotic damage and
weakens on a hit (save ends). It deals half damage on a miss and recharges once
the lich is first bloodied.</p>

<p>As a move action it can use <strong>Shadow Walk</strong> once per encounter, teleporting
twice its speed.</p>

<p>As a minor action, it can use <strong>Lich’s Control</strong> (Close Burst 10; recharge 5-6),
which targets one enemy suffering from a “save ends” effect and automatically
inflicts a -5 penalty on their next save.</p>

<p>If you need a level 14 lich, use this one and forget the one on the MM.</p>

<h3 id="lich-eladrin-wizard-mm">Lich (Eladrin Wizard) (MM)</h3>

<p>This is pretty much a level 24 version of the human necromancer lich. It’s a
Level 24 Elite Controller with 262 HP and exactly the same passive traits,
speed, immunities, resistances, and so on. Even the numbers on the resistances
are the same.</p>

<p>Like its weaker counterpart, this lich lacks a melee attack. It attacks at range
with a <strong>Shadow Ray</strong> that does necrotic damage, and occasionally upgrades it to
a <strong>Necrotic Orb</strong> (recharge 5-6) that doe the same damage and also stuns for a
turn. Every once in a while it will cover an area with an <strong>Entropic Pulse</strong>
(Area Burst 2 vs. Reflex; recharge 5-6) that does necrotic damage.</p>

<p>The eladrin lich has the same phylactery mechanics and Second Wind, too.</p>

<h3 id="lich-soulreaver-mv">Lich Soulreaver (MV)</h3>

<p>This one is a Level 22 Artillery lich with 156 HP. It has all the same senses,
speed, and resistances as the Lich Necromancer, though their numbers have been
increased to reflect an epic tier monster. The same happened with the Aura,
which now does 10 damage.</p>

<p>Soulreavers fight in melee with a <strong>Vampiric Touch</strong> that works like that of the
Necromancer but does more damage. They fight at range with <strong>Dark Bolts</strong>
(Ranged 20 vs. Reflex; 1 or 2 creatures) that do lightning and necrotic damage
and allow an ally adjacent to the target to shift 2 squares.</p>

<p>Twice an encounter they can cast <strong>Black Flames</strong> (Area Burst 2 within 10
vs. Reflex; enemies only) which does both immediate and ongoing fire and
necrotic damage while also making the target grant combat advantage (save ends
all). On a miss it still does half damage and slightly less ongoing damage (save
ends).</p>

<p>And finally, this lich can also Shadow Walk.</p>

<h3 id="lich-remnant-and-lich-vestige-both">Lich Remnant and Lich Vestige (Both)</h3>

<p>These wispy, fragile things are what you get when Orcus or Vecna prevent a lich
from being entirely destroyed. Aside from level they’re mostly
identical. Remnants (from the MV) are Level 16 Minion Artillery, and Vestiges
(from the MM) are level 26.</p>

<p>Remnants and vestiges fight in melee with a <strong>Shadow Touch</strong> and at range with a
<strong>Shadow Ray</strong>. They can also cast a <strong>Orb of Obliteration</strong> (Area Burst 1
within 10 vs. Reflex) at will, or alternatively use <strong>Obliteration Empowerment</strong>
on another remnant/vestige. This causes the orbs the ally uses on their next
turn to cover a larger area (+1) and do more damage (+5). Multiple uses of this
stack, so you could have a bunch of minion liches empower one single ally so it
can nuke the party.</p>

<p>The Vestige’s powers work the same, but they’re worded a bit differently.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The MM has two sample encounters, both Serious Business:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 25: 1 eladrin lich, 2 great flameskulls, 2 soulspike devourers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 26: 6 lich vestiges, friggin’ <em>Dorensain the Ghoul King</em>, 2 dread
wraiths.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, liches surround themselves with all sorts of undead lackeys of
their own making. Constructs are probably very common as well, with summoned
elementals and demons being used as one-off muscle. I imagine devils wouldn’t
appear very often, though. It’s probably not uncommon for a powerful evil wizard
to sell their soul and renege on the deal by turning into a lich, so devils
would dislike liches on principle.</p>

<p>I imagine you could do a whole party of undead villains too: a lich, a death
knight, a vampire and so on.</p>

<p>Mechanically, you should ignore the liches from the Monster Manual and focus on
the ones from the Vault, which are much better designed. If you want to create
your own varieties, base them on the MV liches and their signature traits.</p>

<p>“Larva Mage” is a more generic name for the Spawn of Kyuss, a monster that
as far as I know appeared in the Age of Worms adventure path for 3e. Here, they
are only present in the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A larva mage is what you get when an evil spellcaster dies and their restless
spirit takes over the maggots infesting their corpse. This possessed mass
assembles itself in a roughly humanoid shape to seek revenge or simply to
continue whatever schemes it had in life.</p>

<p>On the surface larva mages seem like a more disgusting variety of lich, and you
could play them that way, but there are some differences. Becoming a larva mage
is a spontaneous process, not an intentional ritual, and it may cause the mage
to lose some of the magic power it had in life.</p>

<p>A particularly powerful specimen might retain much of its power, but it’s not
guaranteed. The first larva mages were created by an elder evil named Kyuss, to
guard vaults of forbidden lore. These are the most powerful among their kind.</p>

<p>Though larva mages are hard to hurt, they can be destroyed through a sufficient
application of violence. When that happens, the worms that comprise their bodies
lose their cohesion and sapience.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get a single stat block, which supposedly represents a “typical” larva mage
whose powers are a mix of spells and being made of worms. You can give them more
combat spells and however many rituals you think are appropriate to represent an
individual that retained more of their magic ability.</p>

<h3 id="larva-mage">Larva Mage</h3>

<p>This is a Medium Natural Magical Beast (undead), and a Level 21 Elite Artillery
monster with 304 HP. As an undead, it has Resist 10 Necrotic and Vulnerable 10
Radiant. As a swarm creature, it takes half damage from melee and ranged
attacks, and has Vulnerable 10 to close and area attacks. A radiant area attack
will really ruin this thing’s day.</p>

<p>Larva Mages have Speed 6, and like the lamias we just covered, they can
disassemble to squeeze through openings as if they were Tiny creatures.</p>

<p>The larva mage’s basic attack is a <strong>Corrupting Touch</strong> that does necrotic
damage, but as an artillery monster it doesn’t want anyone to get close to
it. For that, it will use its <strong>Horrific Visage</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will; minor
action; recharge 5-6) on melee-focused PCs. This dazes them and prevents them
from attacking the mage (save ends).</p>

<p>It will follow that up with <strong>Rays of Cold Death</strong> (Ranged 20 vs. AC), which do
cold and necrotic damage, with a big damage bonus against bloodied
targets. Against groups it will use <strong>Withering Flame</strong> (Area 1 within 20
vs. Reflex) for fire and necrotic damage.</p>

<p>If someone looks like they’re near death or manages to get too close, the mage
will use <strong>Worm’s Feast</strong> (Ranged 5 vs. Will; recharge 6), an illusion that
tricks the victim into believing worms are eating their flesh. This does a big
chunk of untyped damage, but <em>only</em> if that damage would reduce the target to 0
HP. If it wouldn’t, the victim is instead stunned for a turn.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get three sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 21: 1 larva mage, 4 slaughter wrights, 1 sword wraith.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 1 larva mage, 3 rot harbingers, 5 abyssal ghoul myrmidons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 2 larva magi, 2 rockfire dreadnoughts, 8 grimlock followers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>From this we gather that larva mages tend to hang out with other high level
undead, or similarly powerful summoned servants depending on what spells they
knew back in life. They need these servants, too, since they’re pretty much dead
if an epic-level party manages to corner them in melee. If their buddies manage
to keep the PCs far away, though, they can do a lot of damage.</p>

<p>I haven’t actually read Age of Worms or anything else related to Kyuss, so larva
mages don’t stir any strong emotion in me in that regard. Their imagery is nice
and creepy, though.</p>

            <h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>I’ve been sitting on this one for a while now. I’m not gonna lie, writing and
publishing those Monster Manual posts is quite soothing. Particularly the
releasing part, which is just a few mechanical actions now that I have so much
pre-written material for it. Every once in a while I’ll sit and write something
that’s on my mind, and hesitate a bit before posting it. This is one such post,
which I’d say was written somewhere around late April or early May.</p>

<h2 id="the-post">The Post</h2>

<p>One of the outtakes from <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/11/16/on-transhuman-space.html">my last screed against Transhuman Space</a> was a
rebuttal to the bit where it says it’s better and more realistic than cyberpunk
because it doesn’t have any apocalyptic disasters in its Very Serious history of
the future.</p>

<p>I had had whole paragraphs mapped out in my mind about how yes, the insistence
of 90’s cyberpunk RPGs in inserting these catastrophes was kinda silly. About
how they probably had their roots in their authors believing in that “end of
history” bullshit just as hard as the text of Transhuman Space itself did, and
how they couldn’t see the future being a shitty place if there wasn’t a plague,
a nuclear meltdown, or a big war somewhere in there to muck things up.</p>

<p>It was going to end with an assertion that no, you don’t need a big, clear,
forced disaster to head down a bad path. A lot of those cyberpunk tropes (evil
corporations, authoritarian governments disguised as democracies, and so on)
happened all on their own without needing such a push. William Gibson’s concept
of the Jackpot, presented in his novel <em>The Peripheral</em>, encapsulates all of
this a lot better than Transhuman Space’s bright future. Well, he is William
friggin’ Gibson, and he had almost twenty extra years of history to look at, but
still.</p>

<p>That post is all ruined now, of course, because it turns out those
disaster-licious 90’s games were on to something after all. Here we are, amid a
deadly pandemic that’s causing an untold number of tragedies and turning whole
societies upside-down as enforced quarantines and lockdowns push them to change
their habits in a rush. It’s not nearly as bad as a genuine 90’s RPG disaster,
but, in true Jackpot fashion, it doesn’t have to be. It’s not the <em>cause</em> of the
evil corps’ and authoritarian governments’ rise to power, but a <em>consequence</em> of
it. And I don’t think either THS or the 90’s games would ever have predicted
that rich capitalists would, when faced with a plague, suggest that it was OK to
let vast numbers of people die from it as long as it kept the economy
growing. THS has far too much faith in its Very Smart Neoliberals to suggest
such a thing, and it sounds too bleak even for a 90’s-style dystopia.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>In Greek mythology, Lamia was a woman cursed by Hera to become a half-human,
half-snake, child-eating monster. The Greeks themselves would end up using the
name for a whole species of such creatures later on, and a few naughty anime
shows would end up adopting it for their own brand of snake lady.</p>

<p>D&amp;D lamias are a bit different, and have been in the game since at least 1st
Edition. Here, they are only present in the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>It looks like 1e Lamias were a bit closer to the original myth in that they were
creatures with the upper bodies of women and the lower bodies of beasts. In 4e
they’re a type of fey whose true form is that of a swarm of large black scarabs
wrapped around a skeleton, but who can disguise itself as an attractive
humanoid.</p>

<p>D&amp;D lamias are not very nice. They eat people, using their disguise ability to
lure them to their deaths. Some of them also seek to gain arcane power “by any
means necessary”. Every person they eat adds another beetle to the swarm, and
when the swarm grows too large a lamia reproduces by slaying a “worthy fey” such
as a powerful eladrin and injecting half its beetles into the corpse. Once the
bugs finish eating the victim’s flesh, they rise as a new lamia that shares most
of the victim’s memories and knowledge.</p>

<p>In short, they’re fey nightmare monsters.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>There’s a single lamia stat block. It’s a Medium Fey Magical Beast
(shapechanger), and a Level 12 Elite Controller with 244 HP. It has land and
climb speeds of 6 and trained Perception, though no supernatural senses for
seeing in the dark. Their other trained skills are Arcana, Bluff, and Insight.</p>

<p>Lamias are effectively swarms! They take half damage from melee and ranged
attacks, and 10 extra damage from close and area ones. They also have a
<strong>Swarm’s Embrace</strong> aura 1 that deals damage to any enemies that start their
turns inside.</p>

<p>The way a lamia kills you is by using its <strong>Change Shape</strong> ability to look like
a pretty girl/boy/other and lure you into favorable ambush terrain with a
convincing sob story. Once the group is packed nice and tight, it will release a
psychic <strong>Pacifying Burst</strong> (close burst 5 vs. Will; recharge 5-6), which does
no damage and stuns on a hit (save ends).</p>

<p>Once everyone is nice and stunned the lamia will cover one of the victims in
part of its scarab mass in a <strong>Devouring Swarm</strong> attack (Reach 5 vs. Fortitude),
which does physical damage on a hit and allows the monster to sustain the effect
as a minor action to deal the same amount of automatic damage every turn. The
only way to escape is to move beyond the power’s maximum range, which you can’t
do if you’re stunned.</p>

<p>If anyone resists the initial burst, or of they recover early, the lamia can hit
them with its <strong>Cursed Touch</strong>, a basic attack against Fortitude that heals the
monster for the same amount of damage caused on the victim. It also dazes on a
hit (save ends).</p>

<p>If all else fails there’s the <strong>Squeezing Swarm</strong> trait, which allows the lamia
to squeeze through narrow openings as if it was a Tiny creature, likely by
disassembling into a bunch of individual beetles.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The book says lamias often enslave weaker creatures to serve as
bodyguards. Though their stat blocks don’t have powers that allow them to
dominate others in combat, it’s quite possible they know custom rituals that
allow for long-term mind control, or just use good old-fashioned mundane
intimidation and cruelty.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 12: a lamia, 2 mezzodemons, and 4 cyclops
guards. As this shows, they might also just know enough magic to summon some
demons as muscle.</p>

<p>Lamias are mechanically interesting, though if you dislike the “comely
seductress that actually wants to kill you” trope they might not be your cup of
tea. Their knowledge of magic could allow them to fulfill the same dramatic
roles as hags, but as written they seem a bit too overtly hostile for that.</p>
