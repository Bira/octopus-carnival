<p>Retrievers first appeared in the Fiend Folio for AD&amp;D 1st Edition. They make
their 4e debut here in the Monster Manual 2.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<figure class="right">

<p>Retrievers are powerful constructs shaped like giant spiders, built by the
primordials themselves during the Dawn War to carry out kidnappings, thefts, and
assassinations. They’re not smart enough to do anything outside their intended
function, but when it comes to their mission there’s no one better in existence.</p>

<p>Once given a target, a retriever can track it from anywhere in the multiverse
and teleport to its location instantly. If they’re retrieving, they can grab the
target and skedaddle. If they’re assassinating, they can count on their huge
size, bladed legs, and multi-directional eye rays to flatten almost any
opposition.</p>

<p>The primordials can really build things to last when they care to. A significant
number of retrievers survived the War and is still active today, which is very
bad news for the world because some demons have learned how to command
them. Back in the days of AD&amp;D, retrievers were linked to Demogorgon in
particular, but now they could be found in the service of any demon lord or
other entity of similar power. Perhaps some of them still act at the behest of a
primordial, and Lolth is spidery enough to want a bunch of them working for
her. Make any of them angry enough and a few retrievers might show up at your
home.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Retrievers are Huge Elemental Animates, but though they are described as
constructs they lack the Construct keyword. They’re Level 27 Soldiers with 248
HP, immunity to Charm and Fear, and Resist 5 to all damage. They run at speed 8,
but have no climb speed despite looking like spiders. Their special senses
include darkvision and truesight 10.</p>

<p>A retriever has Reach 3 and two basic attacks: a standard <strong>Claw</strong> strike and
<strong>Retrieve</strong>, which targets Fortitude, deals claw damage and grabs the
target. A retriever can move its grabbed victim without needing to make Strength
tests, so they can easily “grab and go”.</p>

<p>It also has access to four different <strong>eye rays</strong>, each pairing a type of
elemental damage with a different rider: acid and blindness, cold and
immobilization, fire and ongoing damage, thunder and stun. The creature can fire
all four in the same action, but must target a different creature with each. At
the start of each turn, a random ray recharges. This means a second full blast
takes a while, but it can fire a partial one if needed.</p>

<p>If the retriever is hard-pressed it can take an action to engage in
<strong>Self-Repair</strong>, recovering 20 HP and gaining a +4 bonus to AC for a turn. This
recharges once it’s first bloodied. Might be a good thing to do when it manages
to run away with its victim.</p>

<p>And finally we have the power that makes it truly fearsome: <strong>Unerring
Accuracy</strong>, which allows it to sense the approximate location of its target and
teleport to within 10 squares of it <em>from anywhere in the
multiverse</em>. Demogorgon is pissed at you, gives your name to a retriever in his
throne room and bam, giant spider mech bursting through your bedroom wall. This
is a daily power, so I guess a retriever on a kidnapping mission needs at least
a few hours before it can return to its master. That’s your window to rescue
them.</p>

<p>The order doesn’t even have to be very specific. “Bring me an elf” will allow it
to teleport to the location of the nearest elf, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Despite being an epic spider mech, the retriever is a Regular, which means it
will usually be found as part of a group. This can mean “multiple retrievers”,
or it can mean other epic assassin-types who hitch a ride on the teleport. Maybe
they’re riding a howdah atop the spider body - it’d be the perfect place for
some epic artillery or controller monsters.</p>

<p>Alternatively, they might be found under the command of a less sophisticated
type of demon who prefers to use them as bodyguards and extra muscle in a more
straightforward combat scenario.</p>

<p>The sample encounter could belong to either type: a marilith with an entourage
composed of an abyssal rotfiend and 2 retrievers (level 26).</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

<p>I first encountered remorhazes in the 3e Monster Manual, though I guess they’ve
been around since AD&amp;D.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Remorhazes are yet another example of the dangerous megafauna that plagues D&amp;D
worlds: gigantic predators with a somewhat centipede-like appearance that
inhabit the colder reaches of the world. They’re also one of those gotcha
monsters, because despite living in cold biomes their powers are heat-based. A
remorhaz can heat its carapace up to an extremely high temperature, which really
ruins the day of the usually-weak-to-fire creatures it feeds on.</p>

<p>A remorhaz is big enough to swallow a frost giant or adult dragon whole, and
while it use that as a combat maneuver it prefers to do it when the prey in
question is no longer fighting back.</p>

<p>Frost giants sometimes risk training these creatures. A few of them even
succeed.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<figure class="left">

</figure>

<p>Remorhazes are Huge Elemental Beasts, and Level 21 Elite Brutes with 480 HP. It
has low-light vision and projects an aura (2) of <strong>Blistering Heat</strong> that does
10 fire damage to any creature caught inside. It runs at speed 6 and burrows at
speed 4 with Tunneling.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Bite</strong> that damages and grabs on a hit. After
grabbing a creature they can spend a minor action to try to <strong>Swallow</strong> it (an
attack vs. Fortitude). The beast’s insides deal 10 physical and 10 fire damage
to swallowed victims at the start of its turn. The victim is considered
restrained, with line of sight and effect only to the remorhaz itself. It can
use only melee or close attacks (with penalties from the Restrained condition),
and if it manages to deal 30 damage the remorhaz will spit them out. Killing the
creature also allows the victim to escape, of course.</p>

<p>There’s an oversight here, I think, because the ability doesn’t list a size
limit for which creatures can be swallowed. I’d say Large or smaller is a good
value for that.</p>

<p>The remorhaz can also <strong>Trample</strong>, moving its speed, crossing enemy spaces, and
making a physical attack that damages and knocks prone against each enemy whose
space it moves through.</p>

<p>That heated carapace can do more than project an aura, too. It can flare up in
an <strong>Immolating Carapace</strong> attack (close burst 1 vs. Reflex; recharge 6) that
deals fire damage and inflicts ongoing fire damage that lasts while the targets
are adjacent to the beast. Yes, this stacks with the aura.</p>

<p>While the remorhaz is bloodied, it can also use <strong>Enraged Heat</strong> to deal
automatic fire damage to someone who hits it in melee.</p>

<p>A good tactic for them seems to be to bite and swallow a PC who can’t put up
much of a fight from the inside, and then run around trampling and roasting the
rest with Immolating Carapace to prevent them from surrounding the remorhaz. An
individual who’s only interested in a quick meal might even try to swallow a PC
and run away to digest them.</p>

<p>Remorhazes being used as attack beasts by giants will be more ready to fight a
battle to the end, and in that case they might wait to swallow a PC who falls to
0 HP. The others would need to kill the creature in order to heal their
buddy. Welcome to epic level!</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h3>

<p>The sample encounter is level 18: A frost giant acting as a beastmaster of
sorts, accompanied by a remorhaz and a rime hound.</p>

<p>I confess that I had a bit of a hard time distinguishing between a remorhaz and
a behir in earlier editions. The distinction is clearer to me now, but only
because I spent some time studying their entries in detail.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see them all.</p>

<p>I seem to remember phoelarches appearing in one of the late Monster Manuals for
3e. I don’t know if they appeared before that. Their 4e debut is here in the
MM2.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A Phoelarch is a fiery humanoid native to the Elemental Chaos. Their orange skin
and fiery hair makes them look kinda like a human-like version of the azer, or a
slightly differerent fire genasi. They’re typically nomadic and adventurous, and
so could be found wandering anywhere in the universe. But when you see a
phoelarch you’re seeing just half the picture.</p>

<p>The soul of every phoelarch is connected to that of a <em>phoera</em>, a fire bird
that’s pretty much a mini-phoenix. Phoeras soar through the skies of the
Elemental Chaos, living their bird lives. Though smaller than phoenixes, they’re
still giant territorial birds of prey and have quite a temper, so they can end
up attacking passing adventurers.</p>

<p>Typically, a phoelarch doesn’t have a lot to do with their phoera and
vice-versa. They have a vague sense of each others’ personality and emotions,
but each lives their own life, and has thoughts and concerns that are utterly
alien to the other. It’s quite possible for them to never meet.</p>

<p>However, when one member of the pair is killed, the connection instantly summons
the other one, which will arrive knowing what happened and will be
understandably very angry at the perpetrators. Since phoelarches are more
widespread, the most common scenario likely has the PCs fighting them first and
then the phoera, but I suppose it could happen the other way around. As long as
one member of the pair survives, the other will eventually return to life.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Phoeras are Medium Elemental Magical Beasts with the Fire keyword. The two
phoelarches we get here are tagged as Medium Natural Humanoids, but I really
think they should be Elemental as well and have the Fire keyword. As sapient
humanoids, a lot of their abilities come from training, so we get two stat
blocks for them. They still tend to use a lot of fire, though.</p>

<p>All the individual stat blocks here are regulars, but they’re really “disguised”
elites when you think about it.</p>

<h3 id="phoelarch-mage">Phoelarch Mage</h3>

<p>Phoelarch mages love fire magic, and travel the world looking for adventuresome
mentors who can teach them using practical lessons instead of classroom
work. Some seek out their linked phoeras in order to gain a deeper understanding
of their link and of fire magic in general.</p>

<p>This Phoelarch Mage is Level 12 Artillery with 93 HP. They have Resist 10 Fire,
Vulnerable 5 Cold, and project an aura (1) of <strong>Phoenix Heat</strong>, which deals 5
damage to any creatures caught inside. That means you should be careful with
their formation if they’re partnering up with flammable allies. Their ground
speed is 6.</p>

<p>The mage’s basic attacks are a <strong>burning dagger</strong> and a Range 20 <strong>phoenix
ray</strong>, both of which deal fire damage. They also know a spell named <strong>Flames of
the Phoenix</strong> (recharge 5+), which is pretty much your typical fireball: area
effect, fire damage, plus ongoing fire damage. Presumably they also know plenty
of non-combat rituals, but those don’t appear in stat blocks.</p>

<p>When the mage drops to 0 HP their <strong>Rise from the Ashes</strong> ability triggers and
they explode. This deals heavy fire damage (vs. Reflex) in a Close Burst 2. It
also creates a zone of fire that lasts until the end of the encounter and
damages anyone caught inside. Finally, when the mage’s next turn comes up, a
phoera appears within the zone and joins the fight.</p>

<h3 id="phoelarch-warrior">Phoelarch Warrior</h3>

<p>Phoelarch warriors are usually wandering mercenaries that seek to get hired as
independent skirmishers and special forces. While their moral outlook is as
varied as that of any sapient, even a dastardly warrior will usually refuse to
work for slavers.</p>

<p>This Warrior is a Level 12 Skirmisher with 114 HP. They have the same
resistances and aura as the mage, and a Speed of 7. Their main attack is a
<strong>burning falchion</strong> that deals fire damage and is a High-Crit weapon. They also
have a <strong>Burning Step</strong> trait that deals automatic fire damage to anyone who
hits them with an opportunity attack.</p>

<p>Like the mage, the warrior also explodes when dead, creating a fiery zone and
being replaced by their phoera in the next turn.</p>

<h3 id="phoera">Phoera</h3>

<p>Phoeras are level 12 Skirmishers with 114 HP. As magical beasts they’re sapient
and can talk, but their toughts are usually a bit alien to your typical humanoid
and even to their linked phoelarch. They have Resist 15 Fire and Vulnerable 5
Cold, and a damaging fire aura (2) similar to that of the phoelarch, but
larger. They run at speed 6 and fly at speed 10.</p>

<p>Phoeras fight with <strong>claws</strong> that do physical and ongoing fire damage, and can
shoot <strong>feathers of flame</strong> in a close blast 4 pattern. They can perform either
of those as part of a <strong>Flyby Attack</strong> as well, flying their speed without
provoking opportunity attacks and making the attack at any point in the move.</p>

<p>When they die, they explode and leave a fiery zone just like a phoelarch. If
their phoelarch is already dead, that’s the end of it. If not, it’d make sense
for the phoelarch to appear in this zone next turn.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is level 12: a phoelarch warrior who fell in with a briar
witch dryad and a few snaketongue cultists. Do mind your positioning on this
one, as all of the phoelarch’s allies are very flammable.</p>

<p>I like the phoelarch/phoera gimmick! Without it, they’d be just another “generic
fire guy” alongside azers, genasi and salamanders.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I’m a bit late to the promotion bandwagon for the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamingballistic/nordlond-bestiary-and-enemies-book">Nordlond Bestiary</a>, since
there’s only a few days left in the project. But I’m still going to say it: go
back the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamingballistic/nordlond-bestiary-and-enemies-book">Nordlond Bestiary</a>.</p>

<p>The book is already funded. If you back the project, you <em>will</em> get your
reward, and you’ll be contributing to possibly making it <em>bigger</em>. There’s a
chance it might make the first stretch goal, which means 16 extra pages full of
undead abominations for use in any GURPS campaign that needs monsters.</p>

<p>One of the classic complaints of many new and veteran GURPS players is the lack
of a “proper monster book” for GURPS 4th Edition. Lots of books include a small
sample selection and tips on making more yourself, but there’s no official
“one-stop-shop” for ready-made critter stat blocks. And of course, this being
GURPS it’s kinda hard to make a truly generic monster book, since whether a
given monster is an impossible challenge or a mere speedbump depends on who your
PCs are.</p>

<p>The Nordlond Bestiary is probably the closest we can get to that mythic book - a
chunky selection of creatures suitable for Dungeon Fantasy campaigns. DF has a
well-known starting point total and a known set of PC templates, you can easily
know how the monsters are callibrated. And it’s also the genre that’s more
likely to need a “monster book” anyway.</p>

<p>The book will be made for use with the DFRPG boxed set, but it’s also perfectly
usable with the GURPS core books if that’s what you have. And since you know
what sort of PC these monsters were made to fight, you can also adjust them for
your specific campaign more easily.</p>

            <p>Oozes have been in the game since the beginning, and as you can see in <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/09/02/ooze.html">this
post</a> the first 4e Monster Manual already featured a bunch of them. As I say
there, far more adventurers lost their lives to an ooze than to one of the
game’s titular dragons.</p>

<p>Here in the MM2 we get a few more oozes, some of which would go on to feature in
the Monster Vault. All of the oozes here have the Blind and Ooze keywords, which
make them immune to gaze attacks and particularly adept at squeezing through
small spaces. They also have BLindsight 10 and Tremorsense 10.</p>

<p>As we saw way back in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/01/04/aboleth.html">Aboleth</a> post, Aboleths can turn mortals into
servitors, a process which turns their skin into a layer of transparent
slime. Sometimes, though, this process goes awry and the victim’s form loses all
physical integrity. The resulting watery blobs full of organs are known as
“skum”.</p>

<p>Abolethic skums are barely sentient, but some memory of what they were remains
with them. This tangles up with residual fear and shame at what they have
become, so they tend to attack anyone who resembles their old form.</p>

<p>Skum are Level 18 Minion Brutes with the Aquatic keyword in addition to the
default ones. They emit a Psychic Dissonance aura (1) that inflicts Vulnerable 5
Psychic to every creature inside. They have Resist 20 Acid and crawl around at
Speed 2, but can swim at Speed 8.</p>

<p>Their <strong>slams</strong> target Fortitude and do a flat 16 acid damage, which is in line
with Monster Vault math. And their <strong>Aqueous Form</strong> trait makes them invisible
while in water.</p>

<p>Despite being described as failed experiments, a skum’s stats make it complement
its aboleth masters very well. If your PCs go into underwater Underdark
adventure (double the under for half the price!) make sure to place a psychic
aboleth in a room packed full of invisible skum. See how long it takes for your
PCs to figure out why they’re taking extra damage from the aboleth <em>and</em>
dissolving.</p>

<p>These also appear in the Monster Vault, so we covered them in <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/09/02/ooze.html">this
post</a>. The MM2 version was their 4e debut, and it’s mostly identical (math
fixes aside). The only difference is that they lack the powerful <strong>melt</strong> attack
and instead have a <strong>Mercurial Body</strong> trait which allows them to ignore
difficult terrain and opportunity attacks when moving.</p>

<h2 id="gray-ooze">Gray Ooze</h2>

<p>Gray Oozes are another D&amp;D classic. They’re about as runny as green slimes, but
more mobile, which means they have always been depicted as active
monsters. Their brand of slime is particularly good at dissolving bones, and
they feed on the resulting bone slurry.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they’re Level 2 Skirmishers with 43 HP. Their <strong>stench</strong> acts as
an aura (2) that inflicts a -2 attack penalty on creatues inside. They have 5
acid resistance, crawl with a Speed of 5, and climb with Speed 3.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is named <strong>Bone Melt</strong>, targetting fortitude and dealing some
acid damage. Each hit also inflicts a cumulative -2 penalty to Fortitude, making
further hits likely. A successful save clears the entire penalty. They can also
shift 2 squares as a minor action, making them quite mobile.</p>

<h2 id="green-slime">Green Slime</h2>

<p>Another monster that appeared in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/09/02/ooze.html">Monster Vault</a>, the two versions are
more or less identical. The MV one is a bit simpler to use, though, so prefer
that one if you have the book.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Oozes aren’t smart enough to understand the concept of alliances, but they’re
everywhere in the world of D&amp;D. You don’t need any complex excuses to add an
ooze or three to any underground encounter.</p>

<p>Our example encounters for these entry are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 2 green slimes and 2 gray oozes lounging around a lone ankheg’s lair.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 2 black puddings and a darkmantle enveloper in accidental
cooperation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 19: An aboleth overseer and two lashers with an entourage of 10
skum. This is that packed room I told you about.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
