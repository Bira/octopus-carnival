<p>I’ve been following the creation of the Psi-Wars setting
on <a href="https://mailanka.blogspot.com">Mailanka’s Musings</a> with great interest, and it’s no secret that this
project was one of the inspirations for me to start my own blog. In fact, as I
write this I am also in the process of starting up a short Psi-Wars game on
RPG.net! Someone else proposed the game, and I stepped up to GM it.</p>

<p>The setup is going to be something I saw used long ago for a Star Wars one-shot
using Wushu: there’s this crime lord named Golko, and he wants all the PCs dead
for some reason. Their only hope is to team up and take Golko down. In addition
to creating a character as normal, each player has to both state the reason
Golko wants their PC dead, and tell me one true thing about Golko. In other
words, they collaborate to create the adventure’s antagonist.</p>

<p>Our PCs are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Jatuu Harhlohuan</strong>, a Felinoid and former arena slave turned
Psi-Knight. Only time will tell if she will follow the path of True Communion
or fall to the lure of its Dark side.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lady Maya Afolayan</strong>, a noble-born Fighter Ace who pretends to run her
family’s shipping concern while looking for wrongs to right in the Galactic
Rim.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Captain Scarlet Crimson</strong> of the Crimson Corsair, a space pirate with a
heart of gold and a quirky robot crew.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Paul “Patch” Patterson</strong>, Scarlet’s chief engineer, who can deal with
technology using both mundane skills and psionic powers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The other important character in this story is <strong>Golko</strong>, of course. Not all
players have posted the required answers, but so far he’s turning out to be a
nasty piece of work. I’ll post his description when I have all the information I
need.</p>

<p>The typical cyclops is a humanoid around 6 meters tall, whose wrinkled, grayish
hide resembles that of an elephant. Also like an elephant, its mouth sports a
pronounced pair of tusks. Unlike elephants, however, cyclopes are carnivorous
and quite stupid. They are commonly spotted slowly shuffling around in the
distance, sluggishly moving towards anything that smells of food. They are a
particular terror to herds of cattle, and cyclops sightings usually prompt armed
response from concerned local lords, who will usually try to drive the beasts
away rather than attempting to slay them and may resort to adventurers or pawns
if their own forces fail.</p>

<p>Scholars can only speculate about the life cycle of these creatures. No one has
ever seen more than two of them together, and the rare slain monster has no
reproductive organs to speak of. They probably originate from beyond the rift,
though no one knows that their native world looks like. What <em>is</em> known from
bitter experience is that cyclopes seem to have an unexplicable fondness for
goblins and their kin. Large goblin invasion forces use them as living siege
engines, equipping them with armor made from enormous, crude iron plates.</p>

<p>Cyclopes like to use whole tree trunks as clubs, and they are not shy about
scooping up pesky humans at their feet and taking a bite out of them. They tend
to prefer Telegraphic Attacks, and are particularly vulnerable to attacks that
target their Will, HT or single eye.</p>

<h2 id="other-cyclopes">Other Cyclopes</h2>

<h3 id="dwarf-cyclops">Dwarf Cyclops</h3>

<p>This smaller variety lacks the tusks, and is “merely” four meters tall. This
means they can fit inside larger caves, and often take shelter there. Other than
being slightly smaller and less strong than its cousin, its stats are pretty
much identical.</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane</p>

<h3 id="gorecyclops">Gorecyclops</h3>

<p>Found only in the deepest, most forsaken pits, the Gorecyclops is larger, faster
and smarter than your average cyclops. Over three stories tall, they
aggressively engage any who dare trespass into their territory, and attack
relentlessly and with surprising skill. They also <em>go berserk</em> when wounded! The
fiercest of these monsters are said to be forever chained beneath the earth for
some transgression committed at the dawn of time.</p>

<p>The one good thing about them is that they hate goblins just as much as they
hate everyone else, so you’ll never find them willingly cooperating with anyone.</p>

<h3 id="armored-cyclops">Armored Cyclops</h3>

<p>Goblins like to encase their pet cyclopes in anything from large plates of
crudely beaten iron to a large pile of stolen pots and pans. This adds 6 DR to
all covered locations (usually the torso and legs). The most sophisticated
warbands will fashion proper helmets for their cyclopes, protecting their eyes
from attack. These add 6 DR to the face and skull, and add an extra -2 penalty
to target their eyes through the slits.</p>

<p>This armor is usually fashioned to make the cyclops harder to climb (see below),
giving an additional -2 penalty to such attempts.</p>

<h2 id="giant-climbing">Giant Climbing</h2>

<p>Cyclopes and other monsters of similar scale can’t really be <em>grappled</em> by
human-sized adventurers, but they can be <em>climbed</em>. Use unmodified <strong>Climbing</strong>
skill for this, as the the folds of a cyclops’ skin are easy to grab hold
of. The monster resists with its DX or best grappling skill as it tries to pry
the adventurer from itself. It’s not a matter of strength for the cyclops, but
of reaching the pest. The monster’s skill may be penalized if the adventurer is
in a particularly difficult spot.</p>

<p>A PC who manages to get to a vulnerable spot in the monster’s body can attack it
at no hit-location penalty using a one-handed weapon. A cyclops who manages to
reach the offending character and pry them loose is now holding a convenient
morsel in its hand, and will usually attempt to take a bite.</p>

<p>I’ve been somewhat lax in following the monthly themes proposed by the GURPS
blogging community. Let’s see if we can change that! This month’s theme is
“Luck”, so let’s see what I can do about it.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-dramatic-editing">What is Dramatic Editing?</h2>

<p>If I’m supposed to write about “Luck”, why did I title this article “Dramatic
Editing”? That’s the name of a rule in the old White Wolf RPG <strong>Adventure!</strong>,
which was about pulp heroes with special powers in the 1920’s. It used a variant
of the Storyteller system, with a “power stat” named Inspiration. In addition to
powers specific to their character types, all PCs in <strong>Adventure!</strong> could pay
points of Inspiration to change the narrative around them. In-character, this
looked like lucky coincidence, but mechanically it was a conscious decision by
the player. The less plausible the change was, the more Inspiration it
cost. This rule was called Dramatic Editing.</p>

<h2 id="hasnt-this-been-done-in-gurps-before">Hasn’t This Been Done in GURPS Before?</h2>

<p>Why, yes! GURPS has several different sets of rules that strongly resemble
<strong>Adventure!’s</strong> Dramatic Editing. Let’s count them.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Basic Set</strong> alone, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>Luck</strong> family of advantages, which allow periodic re-rolling certain
tests and picking the best result. Higher levels increase the frequency in
which this can be done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Super Luck</strong>, which allows the player to outright dictate the result of a
roll, once per real-time hour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Serendipity</strong>, which is very similar to Dramatic Editing but with more GM
control and less guidelines as to what’s possible. Each level of the advantage
gives one “use” per session.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After that we have <strong>GURPS Power-Ups 5: Impulse Buys</strong>, which is a whole
supplement on the different ways you can spend character points to buy immediate
effects. Of particular interest there are the mechanics for <strong>Buying Success</strong>
on p. 16, which at the extreme end can turn a critical failure into a critical
success for 5 CP.</p>

<p>Building on that we have the expanded mechanics for Wildcard Skills that debut
in <strong>GURPS Monster Hunters 1: Champions</strong>: for every 12 points spent in a
wildcard skill, you also gain a “point” that can be used for Buying
Success on rolls of that skill.</p>

<p>These mysterious “points” never had an official name until the Impulse Control
article in <strong>Pyramid #3/100</strong>, which called them Impulse Points and gave us a
rule set for purchasing them as advantages.</p>

<p>With that many alternatives, why I am even writing this post? Most of various
official mechanics don’t really feel unified. If I wanted a game where Dramatic
Editing was central, having several of these mechanics in place would be
confusing, especially for new players. I also don’t like that the default
Impulse Buys rule requires permanent expenditures of character points. The rules
associated with Wildcard skills are nifty, but they require bringing Wildcard
Skills into the campaign and that isn’t always appropriate.</p>

<p>If I was to use a single official rule set for this, it would be the one from
the Pyramid article, but I find even it to be a little too finnicky. You have to
pay for your Impulse Point pool and for its refresh rate separately, which means
your group can have PCs with <em>different refresh rates</em>. The idea of Villain
Points from the article is also pretty good, but making them a fixed
disadvantage that also has an individually adjustable refresh rate makes them
both predictable and difficult to track.</p>

<p>This can only mean one thing: time to come up with my own system!</p>

<h2 id="dramatic-editing-gurps-edition">Dramatic Editing, GURPS Edition</h2>

<p>This system is meant for campaigns where dramatic editing is a major
feature. Its use replaces any other traits meant to represent luck, plot
protection, or lack thereof. It is inspired several of those traits, by the
Dramatic Editing rules in <strong>Adventure!</strong>, and by similar systems found in a few
other games.</p>

<p>Note that these rules use “dramatic” units of time rather than the more
traditional GURPS measurements of sessions or periods of real or game time. I
prefer to use these units because I often play via forum, where real time and
sessions don’t have any meaning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An <em>adventure</em> is a complete story with beginning, middle and end, bookended
by significant periods of downtime. In a face-to-face game, it can take several
sessions to complete!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>scene</em> is a usually series of events taking place in the same location, or
something like a single big fight, chase, or significant social encounter. It
usually ends when the characters have some time to rest or when the context of
their activities changes. A session usually has several scenes, unless the whole
session is just one big fight.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The system is built around the following advantage:</p>

<h3 id="inspiration-15-pointslevel">Inspiration (15 points/level)</h3>

<p>Whether you’re lucky or just that good, you often find things going your
way. Each level of this advantage gives you an Inspiration Point (IP for short),
which you can spend in the ways described in <strong>GURPS Power-Ups 5: Impulse
Buys</strong>, or in <em>Performing Dramatic Editing</em>, below.</p>

<p>The GM defines how many levels of Inspiration you may buy in the campaign. 3 to
5 should be a typical maximum, depending on how cinematic the campaign is. This
advantage is exclusive to PCs, representing the extraordinary luck or “plot
armor” posessed by protagonists in heroic fiction. NPC adversaries use a
slightly different system. Its use in a campaign implies the use of the rules
described below, which apply to all PCs whether they have this advantage or not!</p>

<h3 id="regaining-inspiration">Regaining Inspiration</h3>

<p>Inspiration Points can refresh in several different ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They always fully refresh at the start of every new <em>adventure</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the downtime between <em>scenes</em> of an adventure, you regain 1 or more IP
depending on how long the downtime lasted, at the GM’s discretion. A
five-minute break while running between fight scenes doesn’t refresh anything,
while multiple days of R&amp;R are always worth a full refresh.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You gain an IP for particularly good roleplaying during a scene and for heroic
actions, at the GM’s discretion. Fortune favors the bold!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The GM may give your character 1 or more IP in exchange for inserting negative
events into the narrative. Essentially, this allows the GM to buy success or
use dramatic editing by giving points to the PCs instead of spending them from
a pool.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Points gained through impressive heroics or GM dramatic editing can allow a
character to exceed their Inspiration maximum, and even characters without the
Inspiration advantage can make use of them! These extra points are lost when the
scene ends, so there is extra incentive to use them immediately.</p>

<h3 id="performing-dramatic-editing">Performing Dramatic Editing</h3>

<p>In addition to buying success or improving effect rolls, PCs can use Inspiration
to directly alter the narrative around them. While this is a conscious decision
by the player, and fueled by the PC’s Inspiration, the PC is not aware of this
fact, and perceives this as a stroke of luck or fortunate coincidence. This is
usually done to get the character out of danger, or to improve their odds
against strong opposition. The more extensive and implausible the change, the
more it costs.</p>

<p>Dramatic editing is always initiated by the <em>player</em>, unlike Serendipity, though
the GM still may veto or alter edits that violate basic campaign assumptions,
exceed the scope the player wants to pay for, utterly break suspension of
disbelief, or which simply don’t contribute to making a fun and exciting
session. Players should come up with plausible explanations as to why these
things happened, and GMs are encouraged to ask for clarification if anything is
in doubt.</p>

<p>In any case, using dramatic editing to cause problems for other players is
forbidden!</p>

<p>Below are more detailed descriptions of the possible changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Minor Change</strong>: This change has a minor but not decisive impact on the
character’s situation, improving their odds and perhaps giving them some room
to breathe. It must be plausible given the current situation, and cannot
contradict any established narration. It can do things like bring in plausible
friendly NPCs as reinforcements, insert useful objects into the scenery, or
give the PC an extra bit of equipment they forgot they brought (like the more
specialized Gizmo advantage). The guidelines for standard <strong>Serendipity</strong> are
good here, too.</p>

    <p><em>Examples</em>: There’s a loaded gun in a desk drawer in that penthouse executive
office! These sturdy vines will make crossing that jungle chasm easier!
Friendly police officers show up when they hear you fighting those mobsters
near their station!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Major Change</strong>: This change has a decisive impact on the character’s
situation, turning lost causes into decent fighting chances or perhaps saving
the character’s life entirely from certain death. It can stretch plausibility
somewhat, but it still cannot contradict established narration and must adhere
to the campaign’s base assumptions.</p>

    <p><em>Examples</em>: There’s a <em>parachute</em> in that burning penthouse executive office!
Those cops that showed up and arrested everyone know your PCs from way back
and are willing to release them with a warning… this time. This idling,
unlocked sports car that happens to be here is just what you need to give
chase to the bad guys!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blatant Continuity Violation</strong>: This change <em>can</em> directly contradict a
previously established description, though it still might not violate basic
campaign assumptions.</p>

    <p><em>Examples</em>: Turns out the building’s sprinkler system is working after
all! The lab had a backup generator the bad guys didn’t know about! This
unexplored jungle contains a ruined outpost full of supplies!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Extension</strong>: Allows a player to “hitch a ride” on an edit just performed by
another player, having its effects apply to both PCs. Cost depends on the
scope of the original change (minor extensions cost 1 IP, major ones cost 2).</p>

    <p><em>Examples</em>: That vine is a few inches lower than it seemed, allowing both PCs
to grab it! There’s water enough for two!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Offscreen Change</strong>: The edit affects some place other than the one where the
current scene focuses on. This means that it won’t be of immediate help,
taking anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour of in-game time to have an
effect. This reduces the cost of the edit by 1.</p>

    <p><em>Examples</em>: The cops will be here… eventually. That providential supply
cache is a ways away.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Additional Complication</strong>: This change is a mixed blessing - it makes the
PC’s life easier in one way, but complicates it in another. Doing this reduces
the cost of the change by 1, and it’s equivalent to accepting a bad outcome
from the GM in exchange for a point.</p>

    <p><em>Examples</em>: The cops fight the mobsters, but try to arrest you too! The
life-saving supply drop fell on top of a nest of snakes!</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="dramatic-editing-vs-buying-success">Dramatic Editing vs. Buying Success</h3>

<p>You might notice that even an immediate Blatant Continuity Violation without
complications is cheaper than turning a Critical Failure into a Critical Success
via the Buying Success rules. The downside of that is that Dramatic Editing is
subject to much more GM scrutiny, as described above, whereas a player can
normally just spend the IP on buying success and have the effects happen
immediately. Generally, anything that could be explained by skill rather than
luck should use the Buying Successes rules.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you might also have noticed that the ability to perform an
edit equivalent to a standard use of <strong>Serendipity</strong> per session costs 30 points
instead of 15! This is balanced by the fact that characters can recover IP
mid-adventure via rest, good roleplaying, heroism, and accepting negative events
proposed by the GM, and that this can allow them to temporarily exceed their
maximum. And they could always spend those points in Buying Success instead if
no good opportunities for “lucky breaks” present themselves.</p>

<h2 id="adjusting-the-rules">Adjusting the Rules</h2>

<p>The Dramatic Editing rules are purposefully written to a more “fuzzy”, narrative
standard than what is usual for GURPS material, and rely a lot on GM and player
judgement. GMs who feel that dramatic editing is too powerful as written are
free to increase the costs, or come up with more concrete limits on what’s
possible. One good way to discourage Blatant Continuity Violations is to set the
maximum Inspiration level for the campaign at 3, ensuring that characters can
only resort to that most extreme of edits if they surpass their maximum or
accept extra complications or delays.</p>

<p>The idea here is that players should use Inspiration early and often. If your
players consistently go over their maximums and stay there, you should either
encourage them to use those points more often or reduce the amount of awarded
points.</p>

<h2 id="compatibility-with-other-systems">Compatibility with Other Systems</h2>

<p>If you use Dramatic Editing in a campaign, you should forbid any other Basic Set
traits that deal with luck, plot protection or the lack thereof. This includes
advantages like <strong>Luck</strong> and <strong>Serendipity</strong>, but also disadvantges like
<strong>Unluckiness</strong>, since players get a different sort of reward for allowing bad
stuff to happen to their characters. Both forms of <strong>Destiny</strong> are also
forbidden, since recent interpretations of it overlap with the Inspiration
advantage.</p>

<p>Using this with “Wilcard points” might be possible, though it makes things
harder to keep track of due to characters having several pools of points to
spend. Points from Wilcard Skills cannot be used for Dramatic Editing, but can
still be used as described in the original rules.</p>

<p>Using this with the Impulse Control rules is relatively straighforward! Simply
allow players to spend Impulse Points on Dramatic Editing, using the same cost
table and guidelines! This does replace the <strong>Serendipity</strong> advantage, but all
other rules remain as in the article.</p>

<p>Welcome to another installment on
my <a href="/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">GURPS X-COM: Noises in the Dark campaign report</a>! Today I’ll continue to
tell you about Operation BRUTAL ADVENT, our group’s inaugural mission. The
following PCs participated in it:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kendall Fairbarn</strong>: A paranoid hacker from the UK. Was completely convinced
human society had been heavily infiltrated by shape-changing aliens… and it
turned out he wasn’t entirely wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Minette Duvall</strong>: A bomb-disposal expert from Southern France, Minette is
also quite handy with a rifle. She’s devoutly Catholic and swears a lot when
faced with danger, which is all the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Niu Yulan (AKA Julia Yulan)</strong>: A former hostage negotiatior from China.
Julia is pretty handy with a rifle but her medical training and innate
kindness are equally important parts of her arsenal.</li>
  <li><strong>Jack Choi</strong>: A former police detective from Hong Kong, and a staunch
adherent of the “kick down the door” school of policing despite his light
frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following NPCs also had important roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Valenkov</strong> and <strong>Gutierrez</strong>: A pair of shooters from Russia and Argentina,
respectively, both members of the squad who lost their players just before the
start of the mission.</li>
  <li><strong>Yevgeny Korsakov</strong>: The pilot of the squad’s Skyranger transport.</li>
  <li><strong>Jan Wiest</strong>: A cop stuck in the anomaly zone. Together with his unit, he’s
been fighting the aliens for months.</li>
  <li><strong>Gisela Vahlen and company</strong>: Seven civilians inhabiting a building inside
the anomaly zone. Three of them are relatives of Dr. Vahlen, one of X-COM’s
top scientists.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="evacuation">Evacuation</h2>

<p>After arriving on the scene and <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/02/25/brutal-advent-part-1.html">investigating the anomaly’s effects</a> the
squad managed to pinpoint its source in the St. Marien Hospital. They decided
they will eventually have to get in there to stop all of this, but rescuing the
civilians should come first. Choi is a little disappointed that they can’t just
call in an airstrike and level the place.</p>

<p>Kendall manages to reach Korsakov, who tells them the Skyranger will be fully
refueled in an hour, but that he can leave ealier if they don’t need to fly a
long distance. Getting them heavier weapons would require flying all the way to
HQ and back, though, which would take a whole day. The local military doesn’t
want to share. The squad asks him to fly in ASAP in order to get the civilians
out.</p>

<p>Korsakov says he’ll be there in 30 minutes, and calls again after that exact
amount of time to request specific landing coordinates. He suggests the roof of
a building just behind the one everyone is in, in the middle of the block. It’s
lower than the surrounding structures, which should provide cover from snipers.</p>

<p>The PCs accept his suggestion, and having prepared to move out with the
civilians in the last half-hour, begin to do so immediately. Just before they
leave the apartment building, however, they get a worrying radio message from
the pilot: “I see a weird light nearby. I will investigate.”</p>

<h2 id="ambush">Ambush!</h2>

<p>This is worrying because Korsakov is never supposed to leave the cockpit during
an extraction, and he knows it. Before the party and the civilians have crossed
half the courtyard, they see him exit through the ground floor door of the
center building and head east at a brisk pace, flight helmet still on. In the
direction he’s walking there’s an eerie blue light shining through an open
second-floor window.</p>

<p>Choi and Kendall rush to the pilot’s side, and notice he’s obviously out of it,
as if hypnotized. He doesn’t stop to talk to them, but doesn’t resist when
physically stopped from walking. The others remain with the refugees, herding
them towards the Skyranger, but Vasily shouts out a warning when he notices that
the blue light is rapidly intensifying. In a second, a ball of fire shoots
towards Choi! He dodges it, and it leaves a small frost-rimmed crater in the
ground.</p>

<p>Minette pours suppressing fire into the window the shot came from, as Choi and
Kendall drop smoke grenades for cover. Julia and the NPCs stay by the civilians
as they run into the building. As the smoke grenades go off, a huge alien
<em>thing</em> jumps out from the window to the left of the one Minette was shooting
at, and disappears into the cloud. They only catch a brief glimpse, but it looks
like a giant seven-fingered hand.</p>

<p>Kendall takes Korsakov’s hand and books it back to the Skyranger. The pilot, now
recovered, is only too happy to run the rest of the way towards the safety of
his cockpit as Julia and the NPC soldiers finish loading the civilians into the
craft. Minette stands ready to shoot the alien if it gets close, but it’s hard
to see into the smoke from this distance.</p>

<p>Choi stays near the smoke, intent on fighting the alien. He fires blindly into
the cloud and hits it, but then the creature charges at him and pokes him in the
chest hard enough to break some ribs despite his body armor. He won’t survive
another hit like that!</p>

<p>Kendall runs back to the fray, followed by Valenkov and Gutierrez. The NPCs fire
burst at it and score a few hits, which do a lot less damage than
expected. The creature swipes at them with its fingers, but thankfully
misses. It hits Kendall with another energy blast, but the hacker’s ridiculous
armor loadout pays off, and he gets away with only a slight frost burn.</p>

<p>Valenkov manages to attract the alien’s attention for long enough to
allow Kendall to stick a greande wrapped in duct-tape on its skin. They get
clear, and the grenade finishes it off. This was their first official close
encounter, and it was only one alien. How many more are there?</p>

<p>They would soon find out. With the civilians clear of the danger zone, it was
time to plan the attack on the alien position at the hospital.</p>

<h2 id="spoilers-and-fight-analysis">Spoilers and Fight Analysis</h2>

<p>With the campaign already over, it’s safe to spoil you on the alien’s true
nature. It was a Bakegumo (“goblin-spider”), a creature that’s an integral part
of the ecosystem of the Dreams. They do indeed look like giant hands, though the
seven-fingered part was a personal addition: it both made them weirder and
referenced the “mystical” number seven, which I decided would be a recurring
motif in the alien forces. After this encounter, the PCs named it “Rosie” - I
never revealed any of the creature names in the Dreams of Ruin book, an
encouraged players to come up with their own.</p>

<p>The original stats for Bakegumo gave then five hit dice, so my version of them
is large and has exceptional ST and HP. It’s also Unliving, which explains why
bullets didn’t do much against it. It retains <em>all</em> of the original’s
supernatural abilities, so it’s a good thing no one was grappled by it. This one
was a scout, and approached the building in the half-hour between the call going
out and Korsakov arriving.</p>

<p>The party did an excellent job coming up with a plan to quickly evacuate the
civilians: the longer they waited, the more aliens would converge on their
position. Waiting the whole day for more ordinance would bring an overwhelming
attack force a few hours in. Using the grenade at the end was also inspired, and
worth the two uses of Gizmo it cost Kendall. Without that the fight would have
been a lot longer and more costly for the PCs.</p>

<p>They made some mistakes as well: smoke grenades were a total newbie trap in this
game, as the creatures of the Dreams see through a special psychic sense that
completely ignores things that impair normal sight. There was no way to know
this in the first mission, of course, but they would learn the aliens don’t rely
on normal sight if they had autopsied any of them in the strategic
interludes. Alas, this ended up not happening before the game ended.</p>

<p>This post belongs to a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to
<strong>GURPS</strong>. All other entries, and all other posts adapting the setting can be
found <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Gargoyles in Dragon’s Dogma are pretty much what you’d expect from hearing the
word: humanoid flying monsters with rock-hard skin and a love of clawing out the
eyes of unwary adventurers. The gargoyles of Gransys are living creatures, with
flesh and blood beneath that rock skin, so they add “hunting for food” to their
list of usual reasons for attacking PCs (territoriality, plain cruelty,
etc.). They also have an additional surprise in store: their tails are tipped by
a stinger capable of injecting a petrifying poison into a victim. They can’t eat
the resulting statue, but it’s still a good tactic for finishing off foes who
put up more of a fight than anticipated.</p>

<p>Gargoyles dislike sunlight, and so make their homes in ruins and cave complexes,
particularly those that feature one or more tall chambers full of good nesting
spots. Someone suddenly attacked by a gargoyle in one of these dark places might
confuse them with a harpy at first, only to be surprised at how little effect
their blows have on the creature. Somehow bypassing a gargoyle’s DR is vital to
effectively fighting it.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 17; <strong>DX</strong> 13; <strong>IQ</strong> 6; <strong>HT</strong> 13;</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> 0; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>DR</strong> 9;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 17; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 13</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6.50; <strong>Move</strong> 3 (Ground) / 13 (Air)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Talons (16)</strong>: 2d+2 cut or imp. Reach C. May also <em>grapple</em> at skill 16.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (16)</strong>: 2d+1 cut. Reach C.</li>
  <li><strong>Petrifactor (14)</strong>: 3d imp + <em>Petrifying Venom</em> follow up. Reach C.</li>
  <li><strong>Petrifying Venom (resisted with HT-5)</strong>: Applied via a sting with the
petrifactor, above. Targets who fail the resistance roll are turned to stone
until cured with Stone to Flesh or similar magic.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Claws (Talons); DR 9; Flight (Winged); Night Vision 5; Striker
(Impaling; Clumsy, -2 to hit); Striking ST 4; Teeth (Sharp); Bestial; Bully
(9); Gluttony (9); Social Stigma (Monster);</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: Gargoyles only use the petrifactor as a last resort, as they prefer
to be able to eat the victim after killing it.</p>
