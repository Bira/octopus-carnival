<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Kestrekels are not to be confused with kestrels, which might not even exist in
Athas. They’re basically Darker and Sunnier vultures, with a habit of gathering
around creatures that are about to die in the wastes. They’re a lot more
enthusiastic about hurrying the process along than their mundane counterpart,
and while a single kestrekel isn’t much of a threat a whole flock of them can be
very dangerous.</p>

<p>Those who want to turn the tables and hunt the birds instead might be able to
draw them closer by feigning injury, but this rarely works - they’re a bit too
clever for that tactic.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Kestrekels are Tiny Natural Beasts with a ground speed of 2 and a flight speed
of 6. We get two stat blocks here.</p>

<h3 id="kestrekel-carrion-eater">Kestrekel Carrion Eater</h3>

<p>This one represents a single individual. It’s drawn to movement, so even a
traveller who isn’t wounded or dying might find one or three of these staring at
them from a distance, and following them for a while.</p>

<p>The kestrekel is a Level 1 Minion Skirmisher. Its <strong>claw</strong> attack is stronger
against bloodied targets, and its <strong>Darting Rake</strong> at-will ability lets it shift
3 squares and make a claw attack.</p>

<h3 id="kestrekel-blood-flock">Kestrekel Blood Flock</h3>

<p>You might get a whole flock like this one on battlefields and similar places,
where carrion abounds and its smell carries great distances. This is a Medium
swarm of kestrekels, counting as a Level 2 Controller with 35 HP.</p>

<p>The flock has all standard swarm traits: half damage from melee and ranged
attacks, vulnerable 5 to close and area attacks, can occupy enemy spaces, can
squeeze past any opening large enough for a Tiny creature.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura (1) deals a bit of physical damage to enemies caught
inside, and also slows them for a turn when that happens. Its basic attack is a
swarm of <strong>Scrabbling Claws</strong>, which does standard physical damage with a small
bonus against bloodied targets.</p>

<p>The flock’s sheer bloodlust is also a weapon: the <strong>Loathsome Feast</strong> ability is
a psychic attack that can be used if the flock is adjacent to a bloodied
enemy. It attacks enemy Will in a close burst 3, deals psychic damage, and
pushes each target hit a number of squares equal to their speed.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Whether you’re dealing with a few individuals or a whole flock, kestrekels are
very opportunistic. They’ll stay away and watch until they see their victim is
injured, sick, or dying. Then they dive in. Spilled blood also drives them into
a frenzy, so they’re sure to join in on any fight that they see starting, intent
on eating the combatants.</p>

<p>These things don’t exactly spark joy in me, but it feels like they’re an
interesting addition to any battlefield, where they’d be a constant hazard.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Kanks are giant, beetle-like hive insects. A wild hive will viciously attack
strangers and intruders, but they’re actually relatively easy to domesticate:
just start feeding them. After a while, the kanks will start seeing those who
bring them food as members of the hive.</p>

<p>Each hive has a queen that does little more than continuously lay eggs. The
larvae that hatch from these eggs can specialize in one of two ways:</p>

<p>Kank spitters are the hive’s workers. Their duty is to forage for any sort of
organic matter and process it into a nutritive nectar that is used to feed the
hive (and extracted to feed people). They can store the noxious byproducts of
this processing and spit them at intruders as a form of defense, hence their
name.</p>

<p>Kank soldiers are very straightforward: they’re big, they’re strong, they have
huge mandibles. Their duty is to protect spitters from threats. When properly
trained, they’re also extremely popular war mounts.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Kank queens are too immobile to get combat stats, but we do get stats for the
other two types. Both are Natural Beasts with a ground speed of 8 and Resist 5
Acid and Poison.</p>

<h3 id="kank-spitter">Kank Spitter</h3>

<p>Spitters are Small but not defenseless. They’re Level 2 Artillery with 30
HP. Their <strong>bites</strong> do a mix of untyped and acid damage. Their <strong>Kank Spit</strong> has
range 10. On a hit it does a little bit of physical damage, inflicts ongoing 5
acid damage, and slows (save ends). If the target was already slowed, it is
immobilized instead.</p>

<h3 id="kank-soldier">Kank Soldier</h3>

<p>These Large kanks are Level 4 Soldiers with 54 HP and the Mount tag. Their
<strong>bite</strong> is rather weak to start with, but it grabs on a hit. Once the soldier
has a grabbed victim, it can only bite that victim, but its bite attack gains +2
to attack and +10 to damage.</p>

<p>The soldier can instead choose to inject the victim with <strong>Kank Venom</strong>
(recharge 5+), an attack that targets Fortitude, slows, and deals ongoing 10
poison damage (save ends both). After the first saved throw, this worsens to
immobilized.</p>

<p>If serving as a mount, their benefit is <strong>Grabbed Advantage</strong>: this gives their
rider combat advantage against the kank’s grabbed victim.</p>

<p>Kank soldiers don’t have marking mechanics, but they don’t need them. They’ll
focus on a victim and try to keep it grabbed by their mandibles, using the venom
as a parting shot if they have reason to release the grab.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I keep hearing about kanks in other Dark Sun Let’s Reads, so it’s nice to
finally put a (bug) face to the name, so to speak. They feel more interesting to
me than crodlus, both because they’re beetles and because they have a use other
than “war mount” to their humanoid caretakers.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Described as “small, squat, and pugnacious”, these round boys are reptilian dog
equivalents with keen senses and a vicious streak. On the wild they follow your
standard pack hunter structure, but they’re also frequently “tamed” by people
for use as combat, guard, and tracker animals.</p>

<p>“Tamed” is in quotes here because jhakars don’t form bonds of loyalty with their
handlers. They respect strength and pain, but they also nurse grudges. So the
process of training a jhakar is quite cruel and results in a creature that’s
likely to turn on their handler as soon as it sees a chance. Ironically, because
of this owning a trained jhakar is seen as a sign of strength.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Jhakars are Small Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag. They have a ground speed
of 6 and Low-Light Vision. Their signature ability is <strong>Uncanny Senses</strong>, which
makes their attacks ignore concealment.</p>

<p>Jhakars don’t have supernatural tracking abilities like some of the monsters we
saw before, but you can probably consider them as good at it as a trained
mundane hound.</p>

<h3 id="jhakar-tracker">Jhakar Tracker</h3>

<p>This specimen is a Level 1 Skirmisher with 28 HP and all standard jhakar
traits. As mentioned above, it’s probably as good at tracking as a mundane dog,
but its stat block focuses more on what it does once it finds its prey.</p>

<p>The tracker’s <strong>bite</strong> does standard damage with a sizable bonus against targets
granting combat advantage to it. The attack also lets the tracker shift 1 square
as an effect.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the tracker can use an <strong>Opportunistic Chomp</strong> as a reaction
when an enemy ends its turn within 2 squares. It lets make a free bite attack
with the damage bonus.</p>

<p>Trackers are unlikely to stay in one place for very long. Their free shift with
a bite lets them move in, bite, and then dart away.</p>

<h3 id="jhakar-trapjaw">Jhakar Trapjaw</h3>

<p>This beefier specimen is a Level 3 Soldier with 47 HP. Its <strong>Bite</strong> is a bit
stronger, grabs on a hit, and lets the trapjaw make a secondary attack against
Fortitude. If that one hits, the grabbed victim takes 5 ongoing damage until
the grab ends.</p>

<p>The trapjaw can also <strong>Drag Down</strong> a grabbed victim, attacking their
Fortitude. If they hit, they deal heavy damage and knock the target prone. It
can’t get up until the grab ends either! This recharges when the creature is
first bloodied.</p>

<p>Unlike trackers, jhakar trapjaws are set up to choose a PC and make their day
extremely bad. They’ll do exactly that, positioning themselves as the center of
attention to let their quicker buddies attack the party while they’re
distracted. This works no matter who those allies are, so it’s appropriate for
both wild and domesticated jhakar.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>This entry is short and to the point, just like the creatures it
describes. You’ll never ever need to include normal dogs or wolves in our Dark
Sun Campaigns if this book has anything to say about it.</p>

<p>An encounter group of wild Jhakars will probably include one or two trapjaws
with trackers making up the rest of the numbers. And of course any of the other
doglike creatures in this or other books could be reskinned as a jhakar. They
also work in any mixed encounter as trained beasts, as they are fairly common in
that role.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Unlike most of the Athasian fauna we saw so far, these giant lizards are fairly
docile omnivores. They mostly eat plants and roots, though they’ll also feed on
carrion and small animals. They only attack people if directly
threatened.</p>

<p>Inixes are widely domesticated for use as mounts, draft animals, and
livestock. Some people like to keep juveniles as pets. In the wild, they roam in
small bands. Inix females lay eggs once a year, and are capable of producing
viable eggs even without a male.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Inixes are Natural Beasts, with the Reptile tag. When forced to fight they
attack with bites and with swipes of their large and powerful tails.</p>

<h3 id="inix-juvenile">Inix Juvenile</h3>

<p>Inix juveniles are only about half the size of adults, which means they’re
Medium. This slighter build makes them faster than adults. Juveniles also have
venom in their bites, which they lose as they grow up. They’re Level 4
Skirmishers with 57 HP and a speed of 8.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, their <strong>bite</strong> is venomous, dealing a mix of physical and
poison damage. As a minor action they can attempt a <strong>Tail Trip</strong>, which attacks
Fortitude. On a hit, the inix knocks the target prone and can shift 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="inix-adult">Inix Adult</h3>

<p>Adults are size Large, and Level 9 Brutes with 120 HP and a Speed of 6. They’ll
probably open the fight with a <strong>Tail Slap</strong> that attacks the Fortitude of
enemies in a Close Blast 2. On a hit it deals standard physical damage and
knocks the targets prone.</p>

<p>Next, it’s time for the <strong>bite</strong>, which deals standard physical damage. When it
hits a prone target, the bite deals extra damage and grabs that target. The
victim can only try to stand up after the grab ends, and the inix can keep
making bite attacks against it (but not against others while the victim remains
grabbed).</p>

<p>If the inix is serving as a mount, it can use the <strong>Warding Tail</strong> ability. This
triggers when the rider is hit by an opportunity attack provoked by making a
ranged or area attack, and lets the inix use Tail Slap against the triggering
creature as a free action. This makes them a fine mount for artillery monsters!</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>A short and sweet entry. It’s always good to see another member of the club of
Athasian creatures that are not suicidally aggressive predators.</p>

<p>Encounters with domesticated inixes tend to be much more interesting than those
with wild ones, as they can feature more varied encounter groups. As mentioned
above, adults are awesome mounts for artillery and controller riders. They’re
also fun to have as the draft animal for a “runaway wagon” scenario, as they
tend to be much harder to physically stop than horses.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/">here</a> to see the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Id fiends are big toothy lizards with psionic powers of fear manipulation,
which they use to hunt their preferred prey. Which is, of course, people.</p>

<p>As reasonably smart magical beasts, they are capable of making alliances with
other creatures, though these tend to be strained at best. More often, an id
fiend might craft fearful illusions to manipulate those creatures into helping
it attack others. When that happens, the best tactic is to focus on the id
fiend - when it dies, its control ends.</p>

<p>Id fiends are a major threat to civilians, but a favorite target of seasoned
monster hunters. The House of the Mind in Draj pays generously for live
specimens, whose fresh organs and fluids go into making alchemical potions meant
to awaken someone’s psychic potential. Many of those are dubious at best, but at
least some of them have real effects. The book mentions “terror ichor” by name -
this is a consumable reagent that can be used to enhance fear-based powers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>If Fiends are Large Aberrant Magical Beasts with the Reptile tag. This probably
makes them the most mundane-looking aberrants we saw so far. Just a big lizard,
not a tentacle in sight.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they end up filling the empty niche left by absence of low-level
dragons in Athas. They’re Level 1 Solo Controllers with 120 HP, Darkvision, a
Speed of 6, an immunity to Fear and Resist 5 Psychic.</p>

<p>A fiend can attack with a <strong>quick slash</strong> of its claws, which deals light
physical damage and lets it shift 1 square; with a bite of its <strong>Snapping Jaws</strong>
that deals more damage and slides the target 1 square; or with a <strong>Double
Attack</strong> that uses both.</p>

<p>Instead of a breath weapon, it has the <strong>Manifest Fear</strong> power (recharge 4+),
which affects enemies in a Close Burst 5. Those hit by it are dazed for a turn
as they see a vision of their worst fears becoming reality.</p>

<p>Once the fiend dazes a few enemies, it will use the <strong>Fearful Torment</strong> power, a
minor-action ranged attack that targets one or two tazed creatures. A hit deals
psychic damage, immobilizes, and inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks for a turn. I
guess this means it makes the vision of fear worse.</p>

<p>Once the fiend is first bloodied, Manifest Fear recharges and it can use the
power immediately as a free action.</p>

<p>Looks like id fiends prefer to use their fear powers to kill their victims if
possible, though they’re also perfectly capable of physical fighting as seen
above.</p>

<h2 id="encounters-and-final-impressions">Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>A single id fiend makes a fine boss battle for beginner PCs. Once they gain a
level or two, you can begin to add thralls enraptured by visions of fear, and
fooled into thinking the PCs are monsters to be slain. As the book says, killing
the fiend will likely free the thralls.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting monster, I think. Effectively a low-level dragon that
breathes fear. You can level it up a bit to make it more challenging for
mid-Heroic PCs, but I’d probably set that as the upper bound of their power.</p>
