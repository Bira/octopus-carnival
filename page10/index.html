<p>Shambling mounds are one of D&amp;D’s most enduring plant monsters, being present in
every edition since at least BECMI. Here, they are only on the Monster Manual,
but they got an update in Dungeon 196.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Animated piles of vegetable matter who roam the world’s swamps and marshes,
shambling mounds are carnivores that draw prey into themselves using their
ropelike tendrils. Then they feed by boring countless tiny roots into their
trapped victim’s body.</p>

<p>These creatures are nonsapient, but clever enough to pose as piles of mulch
until suitable prey wanders by. They’re not primarily ambush predators, though -
particularly hungry shambling mounds will go on the hunt.</p>

<p>Shambling mounds are not only immune to electricity, but actually healed by
lightning. I imagine this was a pretty big deal in editions past for those
levels where Lightning Bolt was one of the wizard’s premier attack options. It’s
a bit less of a problem now, except maybe for the party’s storm sorcerer.  This
also suggests the creatures like places where lightning storms are common, such
as monsoon-blasted mangroves right next to those temples guarded by nagas. Sages
speculate that the monsters are actually created when lightning hits a mass of
plant matter in such places, though they don’t know what other factors might be
involved in the process.</p>

<p>Some shambling mound varieties have a further affinity to lightning and are able
to store it in their bodies for use in combat.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Shambling mounds are Large Natural Animates with the Plant keyword. They have
Darkvision and Swamp Walk, some level of Regeneration, and are immune to
lightning damage. They also have a <strong>Lightning Affinity</strong> trait that heals them
for 10 HP whenever they’re hit by a lightning attack.</p>

<p>Aside from a damage update, the stat blocks from Dungeon are identical to the
ones in the MM. We get two shambler stat blocks:</p>

<h3 id="shambling-mound">Shambling Mound</h3>

<p>The classic model is a Level 9 Brute with 120 HP and the standard traits
described above. Its land speed is a plodding 4, but due to Swamp Walk it won’t
be hindered by difficult terrain in its native environment. They have
Regeneration 5.</p>

<p>It attacks with its <strong>tendrils</strong>, and can make an <strong>Enveloping Double Attack</strong>
at will. This allows it to make two basic attacks, and if both hit the same
Medium or smaller target, it makes a further attack against their Fortitude.</p>

<p>A hit on that one pulls the target into the shambling mound! While in there, the
victim is restrained and no other creature has line of sight or effect to it. At
the start of the mound’s turns, those tiny boring roots drain the victim’s
blood, dealing 10 damage and restoring 10 HP to the mound. Up to two such
victims can be caught in this way. All of this is (save ends).</p>

<p>A shambler with 2 victims inside heals 25 HP per turn! And since no one has line
of effect to the victim, those cleric powers that allow free saves don’t work on
them - they have to roll a natural save to escape, or have access to those save
powers themselves. The Restrained condition would still allow them to attack at
a penalty, but that same “no line of effect” clause means they can’t attack the
shambler.</p>

<h3 id="stormrage-shambler">Stormrage Shambler</h3>

<p>This is the one with batteries included. Stormrage Shamblers are Level 11 Elite
Controllers with 238 HP and the standard traits listed above. Their land speed
is a brisk 8, still with Swamp Walk. They have Regeneration 10.</p>

<p>These shamblers project a <strong>Lightning Aura</strong> 2 that deal lighning damage to
those enemies caught inside.</p>

<p>Like the basic model, they also fight with their <strong>tendrils</strong> and can make
<strong>Double Attacks</strong>, but don’t have the enveloping mechanics. Instead, the
tendril attacks deal extra lightning damage when they’re bloodied. They can also
fire a <strong>Lightning Blast</strong> once per encounter (Close Blast 3 vs. Reflex), which
obviously do a bunch of lightning damage, half on a miss.</p>

<p>They still have Lighning Affinity, with the added note that they can’t use it to
heal themselves.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s one sample encounter: Level 9, 1 shambling mound, 3 assorted vine
horrors, and 2 dryads. In Soviet Nerath, salad eats you.</p>

<p>I like shambling mounds! Don’t think I ever used one, but I should really remedy
that. The standard model is a bit more dangerous than its level implies, since
there are few ways to grant extra saves to an enveloped victim and the extra
healing they provide can make the fight last longer.</p>

<p>I believe shadar-kai originated in 3e, though they were completely different
there. Here, they are only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Just as the Feywild contains fantastical reflections of wordly life forms, so
does the Shadowfell present its own menagerie of dark reflections. The
Shadar-kai seem to be the shadowy counterparts of humanity, being similar in
shape and build but with ashen grey skin and black orbs for eyes. They live in
the Shadowfell, venerate the Raven Queen and achieve a level of goth that can’t
be found in the middle world.</p>

<p>Shadar-kai culture and society are described as pitiless and meritocratic, and
merit is measured by the great deeds you have to your name more than by wealth
or personal connections. Note that <em>great</em> doesn’t necessarily mean
<em>good</em>. Causing great chaos and suffering in the world is a great deed. So is
murdering your rivals if they are themselves badass. Acting in the name of the
Raven Queen counts, and isn’t a guarantee the service in question will be
nice. Even a Good shadar-kai is likely to be a very gloomy and humorless
individual. “Perky goth” is not really something they do.</p>

<p>Another significant trait of shadar-kai culture is that they do not fear death,
for they know the Raven Queen will see to their souls when they shuffle off this
mortal coil. This might make them seem more extreme in all they do to someone
from a more standard fantasy culture. Another monster entry ahead will hint that
shadar-kai desire immortality despite not fearing death, so maybe this focus on
great deeds has something to do with that. If you die anyway, at least people
will remember how badass you were.</p>

<p>Other sources would go on to make shadar-kai Dark Eldar-like, justifying the
piercings and body art saying they pursue extreme sensation as a way to stave
off the soul-draining malaise of the Shadowfell. I think this is going a bit
overboard, personally. “They really like percings” should be reason enough for
shadar-kay to have them!</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Shadar-kai are typically Unaligned, which means the ones you meet might be evil,
good, or doing something totally ortoghonal to your goals. Just like humans! I
think they even got a playable writeup in Heroes of Shadow, though I don’t have
that book so I can’t confirm.</p>

<p>Their signature traits are low-light vision (a necessity in the Shadowfell) and
<strong>Shadow Jaunt</strong>, an encounter power which allows them to teleport up to 3
squares and become insubstantial for a turn. All their other abilities derive
from training and vary per stat block.</p>

<h3 id="shadar-kai-chainfighter">Shadar-kai Chainfighter</h3>

<p>This is a Level 6 Skirmisher with 68 HP and speed 6. It wields a Reach 2
<strong>Spiked Chain</strong> in combat and its special attack is the <strong>Dance of Death</strong>
(recharge 6). This allows it to shift 6 squares and make up to three basic chain
attacks against different enemies along the move. These attacks deal a bit of
bonus necrotic damage.</p>

<p>This stat block might also be reskinned into a lower-level khyton devil. Despite
the similar chain theme, khytons and shadar-kai aren’t actually related here.</p>

<h3 id="shadar-kai-gloomblade">Shadar-kai Gloomblade</h3>

<p>A swordsman that uses shadow magic to supplement its techniques. It’s a Level 6
Lurker with 54 HP and Speed 5. It wears chain and wields a <strong>Greatsword</strong>.</p>

<p>As a move action the gloomblade can use <strong>Veil of Shadows</strong> to become invisible
until the end of its turn and move its speed. This can only be used while it’s
unbloodied. This pairs with the <strong>Gloomstrike</strong> passive trait, which adds a
“blinded for a turn” rider to attacks made against targets that can’t see the
gloomblade.</p>

<p>This makes them good at focus fire - use the Veil to get close to the chosen
victim, and keep hitting them with Gloomstrike to keep them blind and
vulnerable. If you miss, use the Veil or Shadow Jaunt to get away and try again.</p>

<h3 id="shadar-kai-witch">Shadar-kai Witch</h3>

<p>This Level 7 Controller has 77 HP and is all about shadow magic. It fights in
melee with a <strong>Blackfire Touch</strong> (vs. Reflex) that does fire and necrotic
damage. At range it uses <strong>Beshadowed Mind</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will; recharge 4-6)
to cause necrotic damage and limit the target’s sight range to 2 squares (save
ends).</p>

<p>Once per encounter it can cast a spell named <strong>Deep Shadow</strong>, animating the
shadows around itself. This works as an aura 2 that provides concealment to
allies, and deals 5 damage to enemies caught inside. It can be sustained with a
minor action, but dissipates if the witch uses Shadow Jaunt or moves more than
half its speed in a turn.</p>

<h3 id="shadar-kai-warrior">Shadar-kai Warrior</h3>

<p>The warrior is a Level 8 Soldier with 86 HP. It wields paired <strong>katars</strong> and can
make a <strong>double attack</strong> in its action. Its main special technique is <strong>Cage of
Gloom</strong> (recharge 5-6), in which it makes a basic katar attack that causes
shadowy tendrils to materialize and envelop the enemy. This is a secondary
attack against Reflex, and a hit restrains the target (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Two encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 2 chain fighters, 2 gloomblades, 1 mad wraith. These are likely not
loyal servants of the Raven Queen, who dislikes undead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 1 witch, 1 warrior, 2 rot scarab swarms and 1 spectral panther. The
panther is likely a pet, and the scarabs either opportunists or controlled by
magic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I kinda like shadar-kai. Their extreme gothness is a very distinctive look, and
I find it less annoyingly edgy than what Pathfinder did with Khytons. I also
like that they’re unaligned, meaning it’s common to find them as either enemies
or allies.</p>

<p>Giant bugs and bug-like things have been a staple of D&amp;D since the beginning,
and those have always included some kind of scorpion. Here, they’re only on the
Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These aren’t your tiny mundane scorpions, but monstrous human-sized or
horse-sized varieties that have dangerous magic running through their claws in
addition to murderously venomous stingers.</p>

<p>They don’t have any elaborate origin, and are just another example of the
patently unfair fantasy wildlife you find in the 4e implied setting.</p>

<p>Like their real-world counterparts, these beasts are predators, and they go for
any appropriately-sized prey that wanders into their hunting grounds. Some
sapients try to use them as guard or attack animals, a process which likely
involves less training and more keeping these things chained and pointing them
in the intended target’s general direction.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<h3 id="stormclaw-scorpion">Stormclaw Scorpion</h3>

<p>A man-sized scorpion with taser claws! It hunts by night and likes to nest in
dark places, which usually means desert tombs and ruins.</p>

<p>This is a Medium Natural Beast, and a Level 1 Soldier with 32 HP. It’s the
Minimum Viable Giant Arthropod, in the same class as a fire beetle. It has
Resist 10 lightning and tremorsense, and moves at speed 6.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Claws</strong> do physical damage and grab on a hit (escape DC 14 or 12), and a
grabbed target takes 5 lightning damage at the start of their turn. The
<strong>sting</strong> targets Fortitude, does physical damage plus ongoing poison damage and
immobilization (save ends both). It can target the grabbed victim but can also
be used against anyone else.</p>

<p>When an enemy grabbed by the scorpion escapes, it can use its sting against them
as a reaction.</p>

<h3 id="hellstinger-scorpion">Hellstinger Scorpion</h3>

<p>A horse-sized scorpion <em>from Hell</em>! It’s native to the third and fourth Hells,
and also found in certain humid and hot regions of the world. Its claws are
red-hot.</p>

<p>This is a Large Immortal Beast and a Level 13 Soldier with 130 HP. It has Resist
Fire 20 and speed 8, as well as tremorsense.</p>

<p>Aside from the bigger numbers and the different element, the hellstinger
scorpion fights exactly like its electrical counterpart. Targets grabbed by the
claws take 10 fire damage at the start of their turns and the ongoing damage
from the stinger is “poison and fire”.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There are two encounters here: 1 stormclaw scorpion and a bunch of kobolds, and
1 hellstinger scorpion and a bunch of devils. That tells you all about who uses
them as weapons.</p>

<p>Scorpions are okay, I guess. Their fighting style is distinctively
scorpion-like, but once you fought one type of monstrous scorpion you know what
to expect from the others.</p>

<p>Satyrs were inspired by Greek myth and have been in the game since at least the
days of BECMI. Here, they are only on the Monster Manual, but they get an update
in Dungeon 196 and become a playable character option in Heroes of the Feywild.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>According to the MM, satyrs are self-centered, greedy and decadent fey who live
to party. They’ll usually behave in a friendly manner to passing strangers and
invite them for a spot of good food and drink. If they’re in a good mood, the
offer will be genuine. If not, the satyrs will rob and maybe kill their guests
once their guard is down. That food and drink doesn’t come cheap,
y’know. Conversely, they’re always on the lookout for danger and trickery even
while partying their hardest, for such is life in the Feywild.</p>

<p>Heroes of the Feywild, which includes satyrs as a PC option, is a bit softer on
them. It says satyrs are by nature both curious and skittish, despite their
hedonistic streak. So they’ll tend to investigate things from a distance and
rely on their charm magic to defend themselves if it comes to that. A lot of
their bad reputation comes from bad encounters between somewhat xenophobic
humans and the first satyrs who crossed over from the Feywild.</p>

<p>Even the MM says satyrs are Unaligned despite its unflattering description of
them, so the stat blocks in this entry could be used as NPC allies as easily as
they could be enemies who <em>do</em> live up to the bad reputation.</p>

<p>A curiosity: all satyrs are male. Their mothers are usually the always-female
nymphs, whose sons are satyrs and whose daughters are other nymphs. The
raunchiness and propensity for sexual harassment of mythological satyrs has been
excised from both depictions, though you could add it back to particularly
villainous individuals.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Satyrs are Medium Fey Humanoids with speed 6 and low-light vision. Everything
else varies per stat block, and we get two.</p>

<h3 id="satyr-rake">Satyr Rake</h3>

<p>This is a mobile rogue-type, wearing leather and carrying a short sword and
short bow. It’s all about running around the party and setting up sneak attacks
with its clever feints.</p>

<p>Rakes are Level 7 Skirmishers with 80 HP. The <strong>sword</strong> and <strong>bow</strong> are its
basic attacks, and it will prefer the former once the PCs get in melee
range. They do extra damage with all attacks if they have combat advantage.</p>

<p>A rake can employ a <strong>Feint</strong> (melee 1 vs. Reflex; minor action) to make a
target grant combat advantage for a turn, so it’s dangerous even without a
flanking buddy. It can also make a <strong>Harrying Attack</strong> (recharge 5-6) which
allows it to make two basic attacks and shift 3 squares between them.</p>

<p>Aside from the updated damage, the only difference between the MM and Dungeon
versions is that the MM Feint is at-will, and the one from Dungeon recharges
when the satyr hits with a basic melee attack. This gives the target a breather
from the constant feinting if the satyr misses.</p>

<h3 id="satyr-piper">Satyr Piper</h3>

<p>A mystically-inclined archer who can produce several mental effects with its
music.</p>

<p>Pipers are Level 8 Controllers with the Leader keyword. Their basic melee attack
is a <strong>gore</strong> with their horns, which does some damage and knocks the victim
prone so the piper can move away. Their main weapon is the <strong>longbow</strong>, but
they’ll switch to playing the pipes when the enemy gets close enough.</p>

<p>These <strong>Wooden Pipes</strong> take a standard action to play and can be sustained with
further standard actions. Their musical magic works in a close burst 5 and can
be either an attack vs. Will that dazes enemies for a turn or one of three
effects that grant allies attack and damage bonuses, free shifts, or free
saves. I think the piper can select a different effect for a given turn without
having to stop the music.</p>

<p>While pipers have to choose between being leaders or combatants, they’re very
effective leaders. The beneficial songs work on every ally in the burst at once!
A piper accompanying a squad of melee bruisers, or a cluster of artillery
monsters, can really increase their threat level.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is level 8 and features a piper, three rakes, and a
displacer beast.</p>

<p>Satyrs fit perfectly as those irresponsible fey who like to “tame” fey beasts
via charm magic instead of doing it the hard way, so you can justify them having
any sort of pet. They also gladly team up with other sapients who have the same
tastes (whether for partying or robbery, depending on the satyr).</p>

<p>Salamanders have been a part of the game since AD&amp;D 1st Edition at least, and
also play a part in Mystara. In 4e, they’re present only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Salamanders are sapient fire elementals who live in the hotter regions of the
Elemental Chaos. As a people they tend to be cruel, greedy and
authoritarian. Their society is feudal, ruled by an European-style hierarchy of
nobles: dukes and duchesses, kings and queens, and so on.</p>

<p>Salamanders will gladly serve more powerful masters such as efreets, giants and
dragons if the pay is right, and they do so with unflinching loyalty. They also
expect the same from their own underlings. Either in the service of these
masters or for their own benefit, salamanders often raid the natural world
through planar rifts in order to plunder it and take slaves.</p>

<p>These slaves from the world make up the bottom ranks of salamander society, and
include not only mortals but also magma beasts and other “weaker” elementals.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Salamanders are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Fire and Reptile
keywords. They have a land speed of 6 and 20 fire resistance, but no special
senses and no special vulnerability to cold.</p>

<p>They use weapons to fight, but can also do something with their powerful snake
tails and employ some sort of fire magic that varies with the specific
salamander. Their weapons have ongoing fire damage riders, and they’re fast
enought to attack twice per action.</p>

<p>More details below:</p>

<h3 id="salamander-lancer">Salamander Lancer</h3>

<p>This Level 14 Brute has 171 HP and fights with a Reach 3 <strong>Longspear</strong> that does
physical damage and ongoing fire damage. It can spin the spear around to form a
<strong>Whirlwind of Fire</strong> that does the same damage in a Close Burst 3 and recharges
on a 6.</p>

<p>It can also attack with a Reach 2 <strong>Tail Lash</strong> that’s a little weaker than the
spear and slides the target 1 square. I suppose it will mostly use that for the
slide, since the spear is better in all other respects.</p>

<h3 id="salamander-firetail">Salamander Firetail</h3>

<p>A Level 14 Skirmisher with 138 HP, this one fights with a Reach 2 <strong>scimitar</strong>
with an ongoing fire damage rider. It can make two such attacks per standard
action, and has the same Tail Lash as the Lancer.</p>

<p>Its special attack is the <strong>Trail of Fire</strong>, which allows the salamander to move
its speed and leave a brief trail of fire behind it. Anyone it passes adjacent
to takes 10 fire damage, but the trail doesn’t persist on the map after that.</p>

<h3 id="salamander-archer">Salamander Archer</h3>

<p>Another straightforward monster, it’s Level 15 Artillery with 114 HP. Its
<strong>longbow</strong> has the usual ongoing fire damage rider and it can attack twice per
standard action.</p>

<p>The archer uses its tail as an emergency melee weapon: it can use it either in a
<strong>Tail Lash</strong> that does fire damage with no special effects or a minor-action
<strong>Tail Thrust</strong> vs. Reflex that does no damage and pushes the target 1
square. That last one is actually the better bet, as it would allow the archer
to immediately follow it up with two arrows to the offender’s face.</p>

<h3 id="salamander-noble">Salamander Noble</h3>

<p>A level 15 controller with 152 HP, the noble is the first salamander whose
primary weapon its its tail.</p>

<p><strong>Tail Crush</strong> is its basic attack, doing fire damage and grabbing the target on
a hit (escape DC 27). The grabbed victim automatically takes this attack’s
damage at the start of its turn.</p>

<p>The noble will use its <strong>Longspear</strong> to attack the other PCs while it has a
victim grabbed, which works pretty much like the Lancer’s spear above. No Double
Attack here, though.</p>

<p>Finally, the noble can cause a <strong>Fire Cage</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Reflex) to sprout
around a target. A hit immobilizes and deals ongoing fire damage (save ends)
without blocking line of sight to the target so the archers can keep shooting
it.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounters have salamanders working alongside fire archons, a
beholder eye of flame, red dragons, and lots of azers. The latter are either
giant envoys, or slaves of the salamanders themselves.</p>

<p>I think salamanders work well as fire elemental opposition that’s okay to beat
up. An azer is probaly fighting you against its will, but a salamander isn’t.</p>
