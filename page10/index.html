<p>MM3 Umber Hulks are in a similar situation to a lot of other monsters in the
book. The Monster Vault would soon be released with an <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/01/20/umber-hulk.html">updated selection of
basic models</a>, and so this one features a trio of more niche variants.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As usual, the basic lore remains the same, but this entry adds some interesting
new details.</p>

<p>The first new bit is that umber hulks are one of the oldest species in the
world! The creatures are already mentioned in certain ancient records from
before the Dawn War, which makes some sages think they emerged from the raw
stuff of the world before the primordials had finished creating it.</p>

<p>The second is that their role as the world builders of the Underdark has a dark
side. Their tunnels may end up linking places that were best left isolated, like
two mutually hostile settlements. This is one of the reasons why underdark
civilizations tend to hunt them down. Some dwarves are also fond of chasing
umber hulks as they tunnel through the earth, for they commonly pass near veins
of precious metals.</p>

<p>Finally, these creatures are not a middle world exclusive! In ages past, small
populations of them found and walked through subterranean planar portals and
spread to places such as the Astral Sea or even the Abyss, and proceeded to
adapt to these new environments.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Umber Hulks are Magical Beasts and have a ground speed of 5 and a burrow speed
of 2 with Tunneling, which means their digging creates stable tunnels. They have
Darkvision and Tremorsense 5 as usual.</p>

<h3 id="umber-ravager">Umber Ravager</h3>

<p>This is a smaller and weaker relative of the basic umber hulk, so named because
it’s Medium and so it’s not technically a “hulk”. They wander closer to the
surface and are likely to be the first variant found by PCs who are not yet
powerful enough to brave the true Underdark.</p>

<p>The ravager is a Level 7 Brute with 95 HP. It can attack with a <strong>claw</strong> that
does light physical damage, and can be used in a <strong>claw flurry</strong> that allows it
to make two attack with a single action. Its most basic psionic power is a
<strong>Crushing Gaze</strong> (close blast 3 vs. Will) that deals light psychic damage and
knocks targets prone. Less often it can use a <strong>Disarming Gaze</strong> (ranged 3
vs. Will, recharge 6+) as a minor action that deals no damage but causes stun
(save ends).</p>

<p>Umber Ravagers hunt in packs, so you might see encounter groups featuring
several of them. Each one will target a different PC with its Disarming Gaze as
an opening move, and then focus its attacks on the stunned target. Yikes!</p>

<h3 id="abyssal-hulk">Abyssal Hulk</h3>

<p>This hulk’s ancestors managed to dig their way to the Abyss, and then suffered
mutations that allowed to survive there. Its bodily secretions became acidic,
and its psionic powers changed to be more madness-themed. It’s also smarter and
more consciously malevolent, with a Chaotic Evil alignment.</p>

<p>Abyssal Hulks are Level 15 Controllers with 152 HP. They fight up close with
Reach 2 <strong>claws</strong>, and with a <strong>Gaze of Chaos</strong> (close blast 3 vs. Will) that
deals light psychic damage and slides the targets 3 squares on a hit. After
sliding, the targets make a melee basic attack against a target of the monster’s
choice. It can also spray forth some <strong>Acidic Spew</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fort) to
inflict 10 ongoing acid damage (save ends) on those it hits.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the abyssal hulk can use a <strong>Gaze of Crushed Will</strong> (close
blast 5 vs. Will) to slide targets 3 squares and inflict a -5 penalty on any
saves they roll during this movement. You know when you roll a save during
forced movement? When someone uses it to push you off a cliff.</p>

<p>So yeah, this cruel mutated almost-demon wants to alternate pushing people off
cliffs with making them stab each other while singing “stop hitting
yourselves!”.</p>

<h3 id="astral-hulk">Astral Hulk</h3>

<p>Despite going to the realm of shiny light, Astral Hulks aren’t any less
unpleasant than their abyssal counterparts. There are signs that they may have
been engineered on purpose by some primordial for use as a weapon, because they
just love to dig into astral domains and tear them up until they become
free-floating debris fields. Several such domains were destroyed by astral
hulks, and the people of the Astral Sea are always on watch against astral hulk
infestations. Their gaze causes a pronounced lethargy on victims, and lures them
closer so the creature can use its natural weapons on them.</p>

<p>Astral Hulks are Level 17 Soldiers with 167 HP. Their <strong>Claws</strong> damage and mark
for a turn on a hit. If a marked enemy shifts, the hulk can use <strong>Entrapping
Mandibles</strong> on them as an interrupt, grabbing them on a hit. Their <strong>Gaze of
Lassitude</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude) deals untyped damage, pulls 4 squares,
and slows (save ends). Their <strong>Gaze of Annihilation</strong> (close blast 5
vs. Fortitude) is an encounter power that does untyped damage, half on a hit,
and marks everyone it hits for a turn.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>If you like umber hulks, you’ll find a use for these. I like that they’re all
very focused in their design intent. There’s one to introduce your players to
the monster earlier, and two to make them despair after they thought they had
left these things behind when they moved out of the middle world.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other.</p>

<p>This is the first time I’m seeing this monster. If they appeared in previous
editions, it was with a different lore.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, during the days of the Dawn War, there was a certain place in
the world that was a major nexus of primal power, connected to a great number of
spirits. This place was annihilated by one of the many cataclysms being thrown
around as weapons during that war. It was not the target - it was collateral
damage. And it was a god who pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The spirits of that sacred site were cast into the world, rootless and
homeless. Spirits of place without a place, their rage against the gods knew no
bounds. In order to survive, they cast part of their spiritual nature aside and
took on material forms made of flesh, becoming the first tulgars. And then they
swore to destroy the gods and their servants in revenge for what was done that
day.</p>

<p>The tulgars would soon find out that attaining their revenge was much harder
than they thought. After the Dawn War ended, the gods retreated to their domains
and no longer stepped into the world. Their followers very quickly grew in
number and built complex societies that were much harder to destroy than the
scattered fleeting villages of the War. Many of the tulgars gave up on their
oath over the ages, and now live as bitter mercenaries. Some of them, though,
still keep that flame of hate going and try to find ways to accomplish their
original goal.</p>

<p>Metaphysically, a tulgar is more or less the primal equivalent of a daeva or
rakshasa. When they die, they are immediately reincarnated elsewhere in the
world in a new adult body, with intact memories of their previous lives. I don’t
think they can reproduce by natural means, but they have been increasing their
numbers. They can sense when a primal spirit loses its home or becomes hateful
of sapient mortals or their gods, and converge to the spirit’s location to
convince it to join their numbers.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Tulgars are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground Speed of 7 and the Forest
Walk trait. Their signature ability is <strong>Unbroken Spirit</strong>, which triggers when
they hit 0 HP and gives their nearest ally a “parting gift” of 10 temporary HP
and a +2 to attacks, defenses, and damage that lasts for a turn.</p>

<p>All the stat blocks here present us with early-epic threats, which is
appropriate for a people who swore vengeance on the gods and has a real shot at
achieving this. It’s possible they would make good allies for the Forsaken,
since they have similar goals.</p>

<h3 id="tulgar-flesh-hunter">Tulgar Flesh Hunter</h3>

<p>A hunter of sapient prey, with centuries of accumulated experience. This is a
Level 22 Skirmisher with 209 HP. It fights with a <strong>Spear</strong> and a <strong>Handaxe</strong> it
uses as a thrown weapon. Its <strong>On the Hunt</strong> trait makes it not provoke
opportunity attacks when it moves for a turn after hitting an enemy.</p>

<p>The flesh hunter can use <strong>Hunter’s Onslaught</strong> to make both a spear and a
handaxe attack against different targets on its turn. The ranged attack doesn’t
provoke opportunity attacks when used as part of this power, and the power can
be used in place of a basic attack during a charge! In other words, no reason to
use a single basic attack when this is available.</p>

<p>Additionally, flesh hunters can use a <strong>Rotting Strike</strong> (recharge 5+) to deal
light damage and inflict ongoing necrotic damage on the target (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="tulgar-savage">Tulgar Savage</h3>

<p>This unfortunately named enemy is a Level 22 Minion Brute. They have a <strong>spear</strong>
and a <strong>handaxe</strong> like the flesh hunter, though it does minion-scale
damage. Their <strong>Critical Threat</strong> ability allows them to crit on a 19-20, and
when they do they grant a free melee basic attack to an ally within 2 squares.</p>

<p>Oh, and they have Unbroken Spirit too, so they make a powerful contribution to
their allies by dying.</p>

<h3 id="tulgar-half-spirit">Tulgar Half-Spirit</h3>

<p>A tulgar that keeps more of its spirit side than most others. It’s a Level 23
Lurker with 116 HP, and it’s Insubstantial.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>Claw</strong> that deals minor necrotic damage and immobilizes
for a turn. It also turns the tulgar invisible for a turn as an effect. If it
hits someone who can’t see it, the half-spirit also dazes the target for a turn,
so there’s your lurker loop right there. It can also throw <strong>handaxes</strong> if no
one is at hand.</p>

<p>When the half-spirit becomes bloodied for the first time, it <strong>Unleashes the
Inner Spirit</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Fortitude), dealing necrotic damage and
stunning those it hits for a turn. The half-spirit then becomes invisible for a
turn and teleports 5 squares.</p>

<h3 id="tulgar-warrior">Tulgar Warrior</h3>

<p>This elite combatant doesn’t care about ranged attacks, and is all about
charging to melee and laying waste to armies. It’s a Level 23 Brute with 265
HP. Its <strong>Inveterate Warrior</strong> trait makes it crit on a 19-20, and deal 3d12
extra damage on a crit. That last bit might just be a codification of its
<strong>greataxe’s</strong> High Crit trait, since it’s not spelled out in this stat block.</p>

<p>The warrior’s basic axe attacks also inflict a -2 AC penalty for a turn. Its
<strong>Whirling Frenzy</strong> maneuver is an encounter power that allows it to attack
everyone in a Close Burst 1, shift 3 squares and repeat the burst attack once
more against anyone who wasn’t hit by the first one.</p>

<h3 id="tulgar-spirit-talker">Tulgar Spirit Talker</h3>

<p>Some tulgars retain a stronger connection to their former spirit nature and can
use that to cast spells. However, the other side of that connection is still
<em>broken</em>, and this slowly erodes their mental stability. Over time, a spirit
talker might become unable to live in its community, and the others consider it
a mercy to kill them so that their minds might be mended by the process of
reincarnation.</p>

<p>Spirit Talkers are Level 24 Controllers with 225 HP. They project a <strong>Primal
Barrier</strong> aura (2) that makes all spaces inside difficult terrain for creatures
without phasing or forest walk. It fights with a <strong>Spear</strong> whose attacks make
the target be marked by one of the tulgar’s allies within 10 squares. Its ranged
basic attack is the <strong>Incite Savagery</strong> spell, which deals psychic damage and
has an interesting rider. If the target doesn’t make a melee attack on its next
turn, it grants combat advantage until the end of its following turn. A great
power to use on primarily <em>ranged</em> attackers!</p>

<p>As a minor action the spirit talker can cast <strong>Dismissal</strong> (recharge 4+), which
targets a conjuration, summoned creature, or zone within 10 squares. It attacks
the Will of its creator, and on a hit it causes the target effect to end! If
there’s nothing to dispel, the spirit talker can use <strong>Call Spirit Warrior</strong> to
summon a tulgar minion to its side, acting right after it in initiative order.</p>

<p>Instead of Unbroken Spirit, the Spirit Talker has <strong>Death’s Embrace</strong>, which
works the same but makes its aura stick around as a zone with the same effects
until the end of the encounter.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like the lore of the tulgars here, because you can see how they might have a
reason for being bitter and angry. I’ll note that the stat blocks here are all
Unaligned, which means the book might agree with me. The only thing I dislike
here is the use of the word “savage” in both the minion’s name and the spirit
talker’s ranged attack.</p>

<p>You can play some tulgar groups as being vengeful against the gods and perhaps
leaning more towards Evil, but you can also portray them as people who gave up
on that vengeance but still can never go back to what they were, which is a very
different story. Maybe some of them might be looking for a way to become full
spirits again, and it might be something that brings them into alliance with the
PCs or with sympathetic NPCs.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Thri-Kreen got famous as one of the playable options for AD&amp;D’s Dark Sun. This
is their 4e debut. They would return as fully-supported playable characters in
the 4e Dark Sun Campaign Setting, about 3 months after the publication of the
MM3.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Thri-Kreen are mostly-humanoid sapient insects, adapted to live in arid
climes. They’re all over the Dark Sun setting, but even in this more generic
version their preferred habitats are deserts and arid wastelands.</p>

<p>Thri-Kreen tradition says they were created by the great primal spirit known to
them as Sand Father, and to other species as Old Grandfather. Sand Father looked
at the deserts of the world and found them too empty for his taste. So he
plucked a species of sand beetle from the world and made them into the first
thri-kreen. Realizing that size and strength would not be enough to guarantee
their survival, Sand Father also gave them the wisdom of the lizard and the
cunning of the desert fox.</p>

<p>In the distant past, the thri-keen managed to form a large empire that spanned
many of the world’s deserts, a nation known as Val-Karri. It lasted for a
hundred years before it was subjugated and assimilated by the dragonborn empire
of Arkhosia. The thri-kreen recovered their freedom when Arkhosia fell, and
returned to a nomadic lifestyle.</p>

<p>Modern-day thri-kreen regard people who live outside the desert as weak, for
only those tested by the sands are worthy of respect. Though they draw no maps
or formal borders of their desert territories, they guard those territories
fiercely and are quite harsh to interlopers who try to pass through without
paying homage to them first.</p>

<p>As long as these protocols are observed, thri-kreen are content to leave other
to their business and to go about their own. They’re very well adapted to their
chosen habitat and don’t need to raid neighbors for resources or anything like
that. Thri-kreen communities tend to be small and nomadic, and might go for
years without meeting other sapients. They display good aptitude for primal
magic and psionic powers, and are often good allies to any druids and wardens
that also make the desert their home. Thri-kreen villains are usually in service
to evil primal spirits, demons, or other groups who corrupt and transform the
land to suit their own foul purposes.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Thri-kreen are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 7 or 8 and
low-light vision. Their signature ability is the <strong>Mantis Jump</strong>, an encounter
power which allows it to jump a number of squares equal to its speed without
provoking opportunity attacks. Most stat blocks here combine martial training
with minor psionic powers.</p>

<h3 id="thri-kreen-ambusher">Thri-Kreen Ambusher</h3>

<p>These are young adults who spent their childhoods learning about the land and,
upon coming of age, are cast out of their tribe to survive alone for a
year. They travel widely to hone their skills, and their extended periods of
solitude also allow them to develop their latent psionic powers.</p>

<p>Ambushers are Level 6 Lurkers with 58 HP and a Speed of 8. They fight with two
<strong>spears</strong> in melee and with a <strong>Mind Stab</strong> power at range. The power deals
light psychic damage and dazes for a turn.</p>

<p>They can also use a <strong>Spinning Spears</strong> maneuver. This deals about half the
damage of a basic attack, but also gives them a +5 bonus to all defenses for a
turn and recharges their <strong>Psionic Boost</strong> ability. This one allows them to add
extra psychic damage to a Spear or Mind Stab attack after it hits.</p>

<p>So yeah, this is a lurker who doesn’t hide. It will alternate boosted Spear/Mind
Stab attacks with Spinning Spear. It’s still pretty good at hiding as well,
which is why it’s called an Ambusher.</p>

<h3 id="thri-kreen-scout">Thri-Kreen Scout</h3>

<p>Scouts keep watch over their territories and can stand still for hours under the
blazing sun while doing so. They warn the rest of the group when they spot an
intruder, and are cautious to engage them, preparing traps in advance. If a
direct fight starts, they’re frenetic combatants.</p>

<p>Scouts are Level 7 Skirmishers with 80 HP and Speed 8. They fight with
<strong>Spears</strong> and <strong>Shuriken</strong>, and can perform <strong>Leaping Attacks</strong> to move their
speed and make a stronger spear attack at any point during the move.</p>

<p>If hit by an attack, they can use <strong>Sudden Recoil</strong> to shift 1 square away as a
reaction. If the attack bloodies them, they can shift 4 squares instead. They
also have a <strong>Psionic Boost</strong> power similar to that of the Ambusher, though this
one recharges automatically on a 5+.</p>

<p>Scouts will alternate boosted basic attacks with Leaping Attacks, and will
probably have traps lying around the battlefield if they were expecting
company.</p>

<h3 id="thri-kreen-desert-talker">Thri-Kreen Desert Talker</h3>

<p>This is a primal spellcaster with powers over the desert sands. They tend to act
as judges in thri-kreen communities, trying those who break their laws and
customs and punishing the guilty. The most severe punishments are execution and
exile to the desert, but I imagine there are smaller ones for lesser offenses.</p>

<p>Sand Talkers fight with their bare <strong>claws</strong> and throw <strong>shurikens</strong>, but they
also have a couple of sand-bending spells for use in combat. <strong>Shifting Dune
Rend</strong> (area 1 within 10 vs. Reflex) deals no damage, but knocks prone on a hit
and slides 2 squares as an effect. <strong>Desert Tempest</strong> (close blast 5) deals
minor physical damage, pushes 2 squares, and blinds (save ends). It recharges
when the thri-kreen is bloodied.</p>

<p>All of this pushing around synergizes with <strong>Sand Trap</strong>, a minor action that
allows it to create three of the things within 10 squares. When an enemy starts
their turn in a sand trap square, they are restrained for a turn, and then the
sand trap disappears. The power recharges when there are no sand traps left in
the field.</p>

<p>Desert talkers are good for breaking up PC formations and setting things up for
their allies, which is exactly what they’ll spend the first few rounds
doing. Their special attacks do very little damage, but their basic ones are
okay and a good choice once all the PCs are good and restrained.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>I love thri-kreen! Whether they’re from Athas or not, I find their look
extremely interesting, and I also liked that this generic version of their
culture does not make them universally hostile.</p>

            <p>I’ve been playing a lot of Wolfenstein games these past few days. There’s
something cathartic about unapologetically fighting Nazis. I first did it to
de-stress, and then to celebrate the results of our most recent election (go
Lula!).</p>

<p>And since I do occasionally want to post something here that’s not Let’s Read
the Monster Manual, I decided to talk a bit about the various guns you use to
kill Nazis in all of these games.</p>

<p>We’re dealing with two separate continuities here: one that starts with Return
to Castle Wolfenstein (2001) and another that starts with Wolfenstein: The New
Order (2014). You could, if you’re so inclined, include both of them in the
GURPS Infinite Worlds framework. I’d call then Wolfenstein-1 and Wolfenstein-2
respectively, though I guess Infinity might call the latter Reich-6 at first.</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll cover the stuff that appears in Return to Castle
Wolfenstein (2001), AKA the Wolfenstein-1 setting.</p>

<h2 id="game-overview">Game Overview</h2>

<p>This is a flashier remake of Wolfenstein 3D, the game that more or less started
the FPS genre back in 1992. It’s the first game in the franchise to have a more
fleshed out story wrapped around its gameplay, with voiced dialogue and
cutscenes elaborating on the simpler “you must escape the castle and kill Nazis”
plot of the 1992 game.</p>

<p>The game takes place in a pulpier version of WWII, where the Nazis are working
on a large variety of scary secret projects and the OSA (a joint Allied spy
agency) is sending agents to stop them from hitting the field. The player
character, as always, is William “B. J.” Blazkowicz. He gets sent along with a
British agent to Castle Wolfenstein to find more about these projects, they get
captured, and the game starts with Blazko’s escape attempt and moves on to
thwarting those projects to the Allies can win the war.</p>

<p>There are two sinister things going on here: an attempt by the Thule society to
resurrect ancient evil undead knights, and a mad science lab working to build
cyborg supersoldiers. The final boss is, of course, a bunch of cyborg
supersoldiers possessed by the spirits of ancient evil undead knights.</p>

<h2 id="historical-weapons">Historical Weapons</h2>

<p>Wolfenstein-1 is mostly a pulpier version of WWII, so a lot of the weapons we
see are historical and present on GURPS High-Tech. Though sometimes you’ll start
a level with some Allied weapons issued by the OSA, the vast majority of the
time you’ll be using captured German hardware.</p>

<p>OSA-issue weapons include the <strong>Colt M1911A1</strong> pistol (p. HT99), the <strong>Thompson
M1</strong> submachine gun (p. HT122), and the <strong>Enfield Sten Mk IIS</strong> submachine gun
(p. HT 125). The integral suppressor of the Sten works according to cinematic
principles here, making it completely silent to enemies.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, one of the “elite guard” units you face in the game also
uses Stens, because they’re meant to be sneaky and the Sten is the only
suppressed SMG in the game. The other OSA weapons are used exclusively by the
player character.</p>

<p>German weapons include the <strong>Luger P08</strong> pistol, (p. HT98), the <strong>ERMA MP40</strong>
SMG (p. HT 124), the <strong>Mauser Kar98K</strong> rifle (p. HT111), the <strong>Rheinmetall
FG42</strong> battle rifle (p. HT 115) and the <strong>Panzerfaust</strong> (p. HT147). The player
also uses these extensively, since every enemy drops ammo for one of them.</p>

<p>The FG42 is the signature weapon of the other “elite guard” unit in the game,
and has the scope described in its High-Tech entry. It’s also possible to find a
suppressor for the Luger and a variable-power scope for the Mauser, which you
can stat up using the generic rules in p. HT 156 and p. HT 158.</p>

<p>You can occasionally also find a few <strong>MG42</strong> machine gun (p. HT 134)
emplacements in the game. There is also a flamethrower similar to the <strong>M2-2</strong>
(p. HT179), though this is probably the German equivalent rather than the
American version in the book.</p>

<p>Grenades also see use, with most of them being the German <strong>Stielhandgranate
24</strong>, and the rest American <strong>AMC Mk II</strong> models. Both are on p. HT190-191.</p>

<h2 id="fictional-weapons">Fictional Weapons</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of pulpy arms research going on here on both sides, so we also get
to see some weapons that don’t exist in reality. We’ll cover these in a bit more
detail.</p>

<h3 id="snooper-rifle">Snooper Rifle</h3>

<p>This is a prototype sniper rifle issued to Blazkowicz by the OSA early in the
second mission of the game. You also find captured rifles later on while
breaking into one of the games’ many secret lab facilities.</p>

<p>The Snooper is the most down-to-earth of the experimental weapons here, being an
exaggerated version of the <strong>M3 Carbine</strong> (p. HT113). Even the fancy infrared
sight is real! The biggest changes are the addition of a cinematic integral
suppressor that makes the gun completely silent, and making the infrared sight
more advanced than it really was. The one in the game has variable magnification
and requires no external batteries.</p>

<h3 id="venom-machine-gun">Venom Machine Gun</h3>

<p>This is the first entirely fictional weapon we encounter in the game, and the
second most unrealistic one. It’s a portable, six-barreled, belt-fed minigun. It
has relatively short barrels, a shoulder stock and rifle-style grips. There’s an
in-game document that describes it as firing 7.92mm saboted armor piercing
rounds, but the ammo for it is labeled as “12.7mm” in game. You first find the
Venom as a prototype in one of the secret labs that make up the game’s levels,
and after that it starts appearing in the hands of some enemy human
soldiers. Most of the cyborg supersoldiers you meet towards the end of the game
also carry one.</p>

<p>We’ll need custom stats for this one! Let’s go with the assumption that it fires
7.92mm ammo, to make it minimally plausible for it to be portable. To make it a
little easier on the user, we can further say it fires the 7.92x33mm Kurz round,
instead of the longer 7.92x57mm Mauser round from the Kar98K.</p>

<p>The in-game Venom takes up to 500 rounds. These would probably be in a
disintegrating belt inside a metal can that can be worn as a backpack. The whole
thing weights around 16kg, more than the weapon itself. More reasonable 200 and
100 round belts with their smaller containers might weight in at 8 and 4kg
respectively.</p>

<p>We’ll actually base the stats for it on the Minigun from page 138 of GURPS
Ultra-Tech, making the Venom a TL 7+2 weapon. The one on the table fires APDS
ammo, which is also TL 7+2 in this caliber, and has a 500-round belt.</p>

<p>The Venom requires Guns (LMG) to operate, or Guns (Longarm) with the Burst-Fire
technique if using the alternate gun skill rules from Pyramid #3/65.</p>

<h3 id="tesla-gun">Tesla Gun</h3>

<p>The weapon used by the advanced cyborg supersoldiers you meet at the very end of
the game. Unlike the Venom this doesn’t bear even the tiniest resemblance to any
real gun. Pull the trigger and it fires a stream of lightning until you release
it or until it runs out of charge.</p>

<p>The Tesla Gun draws power from a superscience backpack battery equivalent to a
TL 9 D cell, but four times heavier. Its damage follows the same rules as the
Lightning spell: metal armor only provides DR 1, and the target must make a HT
roll with a penalty of -1 for every 2 points of injury taken from it. Failure
means they’re stunned, and must attempt an HT roll every turn in order to
recover.</p>

<p>The Tesla Gun requires Gunner (Beam) to operate, even when carried.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-for-these-fancy-guns">How much for these fancy guns?</h2>

<p>You’ll notice that I ommitted any price information for the Venom and the Tesla
Gun above. That’s because in Wolfenstein-1 they’re secret prototypes with very
limited production runs. You don’t buy them, you pry them from the hands of dead
Nazi assholes.</p>

<p>If you want to use them on a different setting where they are available for
purchase, use the following costs:</p>

<table>

      <th style="text-align: center">Name</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Cost</th>

      <td style="text-align: center">Tesla Battery</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">$400</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These are for a setting with a tech level of 7+2. If you’re in a “plain” TL9
setting you might want to use the Minigun and Semi-Portable Electrolaser from
Ultra-tech, which have slightly better stats.</p>

<p>If your setting is like Wolfenstein-1, where the overall TL is a plain 7 and
these are secret superscience prototypes, multiply all prices by 4.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other.</p>

<p>This one feels like an AD&amp;D 2nd Edition creation, as that’s when they renamed
demons as “ta’nari”.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Tannarukk are engineered hybrids of orc and demon DNA, the product of rituals
performed by demon lords or ambitious mortal spellcasters. These rituals are
effectively a mass-production process, as they involve pulsing vats and can
create dozens of the creatures at once. In most cases they’re immediately put to
work as soldiers and weapons of war, though they’re extremely difficult to keep
under control unless they get “enough” opportunity to commit violence. As you
might expect, that’s a tall order.</p>

<p>The few free tannarukk bands that exist tend to seek work as mercenaries. Free or
not, they can most often be found in the Astral Sea or Elemental Chaos, usually
fighting something. They do sometimes show up in the middle world, and they love
it because few warriors there can match their skill and resilience in combat.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Tannarukks are Medium Elemental Humanoids with the Demon and Orc keywords. They
have Darkvision and Speed 6, along with Resist Fire 5. Their signature trait is
<strong>Indomitable Fury</strong>, which kicks in when they drop to 0 HP for the first time
in the fight. It makes them stay at 1 HP instead and gives them +2 to attacks
and +4 to damage until the end of the encounter.</p>

<p>This means the PCs should make sure each Tannarukk in the encounter stays down by
hitting it again before it can get a chance to take more actions. If they don’t,
they’re going to take more damage; if they do, that’s one attack that didn’t go
to a healthier monster.</p>

<h3 id="tannarukk-marauder">Tannarukk Marauder</h3>

<p>Most tannarukks conform to this stat block, which is your basic enthusiastic axe
murderer. Marauders wear hide and wield a <strong>greataxe</strong>, and can also thrown
<strong>handaxes</strong> at those they can’t quite reach.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Nimble Reaction</strong> trait gives them +4 AC against opportunity attacks,
which is good because their signature move relies on fishing for them: <strong>Brutal
Rampage</strong> allows them to move their speed and make a greataxe attack at any
point during the move. This attack gains a +5 damage bonus for each opportunity
attack made against the marauder during the move (but before the attack). The
opportunity attacks don’t need to hit, they just need to happen.</p>

<h3 id="tannarukk-steel-warrior">Tannarukk Steel Warrior</h3>

<p>This is a bigger tannarukk that received better training and had armor riveted to
its hide. It’s a Level 18 Soldier with 177 HP. Its armor counts as plate, and it
wields a shield and a <strong>Longsword</strong>, plus a <strong>Crossbow</strong> for ranged attacks.</p>

<p>The sword marks for a turn, and the warrior can make free attacks against
enemies that ignore the mark. It can also be used in a special attack named
<strong>Burning Cage</strong> (recharge 5+). This melee attack targets Reflex and does heavy
fire damage. The target takes a further 5 fire damage every time it enters a
square during its turn (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="tannarukk-flame-speaker">Tannarukk Flame Speaker</h3>

<p>This is a tannarukk spellcaster whose power relies on a connection to the abyssal
flames that go into their production ritual. It’s level 17 Artillery with 129
HP and resist 10 fire, a bit higher than usual for them.</p>

<p>The flame speaker fights with a <strong>Staff</strong> in melee, and with <strong>fire bolts</strong> at
range. It can also shoot a <strong>fire barrage</strong> (recharge 5+) that targets up to
three creatures but does a bit less damage than the basic bolt.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, the flame speaker can summon <strong>Winds of Fire</strong>, an area
burst attack that deals fire damage and creates a zone that lasts for the rest
of the encounter. Anyone starting their turn inside takes 10 fire damage and is
pulled 1 square towards the zone’s origin square.</p>

<p>In addition to Indomitable Fury, the flame speaker also has <strong>Avenging Fire</strong>,
which triggers when it hits 0 HP for the second time. It deals some automatic
fire damage to the triggering enemy.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>These stat blocks take up a lot of space on the book, but they’re simpler than
they look. Each one has a solid gimmick and appropriate base stats. I guess
tannarukks are meant to be regular enemies for upper paragon PCs - stronger than
minions, but you’ll still meet a lot of them.</p>

<p>Lore-wise, I’m not sure I like them. They’re more or less D&amp;D’s take on the
Uruk-Hai, I guess, but there are a lot more opponents at this level range that
feel cooler and less potentially problematic.</p>
