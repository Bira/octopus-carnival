          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/10/06/neverwinter-hotenow.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: Mount Hotenow</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Mount Hotenow is a huge barely-dormant volcano on the southeast end of the
Crags, in Neverwinter Wood. The heat it produces is the reason the region’s
rivers never freeze, and therefore it’s at the root of Neverwinter’s
prosperity. It was also the cause of its downfall 27 years ago, when a Thayan
ritual caused it to erupt.</p>

<p>Even before the cataclysm Mount Hotenow was already the subject of many rumors
and legends. It’s an opening to Hell; it’s an opening to the Elemental Chaos;
demons live here; giants live here; dragons live here; and so on. The most
recent tale is that anyone who enters one of Hotenow’s many caves is fated to
die within a year, even if they make it out.</p>

<h2 id="fire-cultists">Fire Cultists</h2>

<p>Though the original mountain in the middle world is back to its pre-cataclysm
state, its reflection on the Shadowfell has been spewing a slow and steady
stream of lava since the cataclysm. Some people believe that this shadow
eruption could cause one in the middle world if the barriers between planes wear
thin enough. Such a state of constant eruption would spell doom for Neverwinter.</p>

<p>Chief among these believers are the many elemental fire creatures that do indeed
make Mount Hotenow their home. They’re led by the hunchbacked fire giant
Gommoth, who has lived here since he was banished from his clan. The eruption 27
years ago was a major ecstatic experience to him and to every other fire
creature who lived here, and since then Gommoth started a cult dedicated to
making it happen again.</p>

<p>The ecstatic experience happened because it was Maegera’s near-awakening that
caused the eruption, and her power tugged at the elementals’ primordial
nature. Gommoth doesn’t know this, but the cult’s latest rising star probably
does. This is Qualthus, the shadovar outcast. Remember him? He was banished from
Xinlenal after being blamed for the accidental sabotage of their mythallar. True
to the general disposition of his former buddies, Qualthus has decided that the
best way to remedy this injustice is to cause Mount Hotenow to erupt again and
bury Xinlenal in lava.</p>

<p>He’s confident he can do it. After all he’s an arcanist of the Netherese
tradition (read: a megalomaniacal asshole). His actual chances are incredibly
small, after all it took the full might of the Dread Ring to make it happen the
first time. But he could get lucky, since Maegera’s bonds are weakened.</p>

<p>To represent Gommoth, the book suggests using an ogre mercenary stat block with
added fire resistance, increased Charisma, and with attacks doing fire
damage. You could also level down a standard fire giant stat block to make him
fit with the campaign’s level range.</p>

<h2 id="the-river-of-flame">The River Of Flame</h2>

<p>Deep underground, beneath the territory of the fire cultists, there is a river
of liquid flame. This isn’t poetic language or a metaphor for magma, but a
literal description. The river follows a winding subterranean path, and the
important thing for player characters is that it passes by a tunnel that leads
directly to Gauntlgrym.</p>

<p>PCs who know where to disembark could take some sort of fireproof boat or
submersible through this river, and arrive at the lost city. Their main
challenge here besides the hostile environment is Karrundax, the very
territorial young red dragon who lairs in the area.</p>

<h2 id="seekers-of-the-way">Seekers of the Way</h2>

<p>One thing that happens repeatedly in this book is that a theme description in
Chapter 2 will give us the impression that the PC in question is the only one
doing something, and then a faction or location description further down the
line will give us a whole group of NPCs with the same goal, and that’s going to
be the first time we hear of these NPCs.</p>

<p>This might be a disconnect between different authors, or it might be a sort of
soft “Player’s Guide/Campaign Setting” separation within the same book, since
presumably you want PCs to choose a theme without seeing any spoilers about what
they’ll encounter during the campaign. Whatever the case, we now run into the
group that ties to the Heir of Delzoun, and it’s a genuine Dwarf Fortress
expedition!</p>

<p>The Heir’s description actively lied to the player: they’re not one of the last
dwarves who are still looking for the lost city. In reality there are so many
that after their disparate teams and groups joined together to coordinate their
efforts they had to elect a government to keep them organized. Their newly
elected leader decided that Mount Hotenow was their best bet, since there were
many stories connecting it to Gauntlgrym and a few confirmed Delzoun outposts on
its slopes.</p>

<p>This extremely large expedition set out from Neverwinter before the Heir got
here, and the litany of setbacks and tragedies they experienced along the way is
what gives me that Fun (TM) Dwarf Fortress vibe.</p>

<p>First they bought a letter of safe passage from Neverember in order to pass
through Many-Arrows territory unharmed, but the dwarves and orcs just couldn’t
resist provoking each other until hostilities broke out.</p>

<p>Then they arrived at the Wood and lost yet more dwarves to eladrin arrows and
miscellaneous monsters. Either Shandarar’s guardians were particularly
trigger-happy or it was those old rivalries flaring up again.</p>

<p>Then they got to the volcano and lost a bunch more dwarves to Gommoth’s cult.</p>

<p>And now they’re stuck at the river of flame. Can’t forge ahead because no one
packed a fireproof submersible, can’t retreat because the survivors aren’t sure
they can make it back to Neverwinter alive. To say that morale is low is a
massive understatement.</p>

<p>Morale would be even lower if the expedition’s leader, Vandra Hillborn, revealed
the terrible secret she’s keeping. Many of the dwarves “lost” to the elementals
actually <em>defected</em> to them, and now work together to bring about the volcano’s
next eruption. Hillborn believes they cracked under the strain of the trip and
went insane, but the truth is even worse: they were intentionally driven insane
by the Gauntlgrym mind-flayers through remote telepathy. The flayers believe
that a volcanic eruption is just the thing to permanently block access to
Gauntlgrym and prevent any meddlers from finding it.</p>

<p>As we already know, the mind flayers are themselves being controlled by the
aboleths, so we have a true conspiracy onion here.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>There are several ways to discover Gauntlgrym’s precise location elsewhere, but
the River of Flame under Mount Hotenow appears to be the most viable path to
actually go there. The fate of the dwarven expedition is a good blueprint of
what an overland journey from Neverwinter to here would involve.</p>

<p>It’s possible to have an entire party of PCs who would be more interested in
pursuing this journey than dealing with the other hooks in the setting: not just
one or more Heirs of Delzoun but also perhaps one of Oghma’s Faithful who’s
really into archaeology, a Dead Rat Deserter who’s after the score of the
century, and even a Neverwinter Noble in a campaign where finding Gauntlgrym
will give them the popular acclaim they need to take the throne. If there’s an
extended detour to deal with the eladrin, then perhaps the Iliyanbruen Guardian
can get into the mix too.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This post covers the city itself and several nearby locations related to the
Gray Wolf Uthgardt, who serve the Netherese.</p>

<h2 id="content-warning-brutal-savages-nonsense">Content Warning: “Brutal Savages” nonsense</h2>

<p>There is a lot of Gray Wolf material in this section, and this is where the
mounting inconsistencies in their portrayal start to get in the way. The stuff
about them that I read so far gave me the impression of a people who were mostly
minding their own business before the Netherese turned their leaders into
fascist assholes. Most of the actual tribe members were not happy with the
situation: a significant number of them had defected, and those who hadn’t were
open to persuasion by a PC like the Pack Outcast.</p>

<p>This section drops most of that and goes all in on the “brutal savages who
disdain civilization” cliches, painting the Gray Wolf as being bad guys even
before the Netherese got to them. After being co-opted, they got even worse.
Anyone who’s still a member of the tribe at this point is either on board with
the cruelty or too cowardly to ever stand against it. Even their guardian
spirits are disgusted with them.</p>

<p>I’m going to report what the book says below, but I personally would completely
change it were I to run a Neverwinter campaign.</p>

<h2 id="xinlenal-from-the-outside-in">Xinlenal From the Outside In</h2>

<p>As we saw before, Xinlenal wasn’t just a Netherese flying city, it was the first
ever built. It fell here in the Wood when Netheril’s magic stopped
working. Today, when viewed from the outside, it looks like an out-of-place
60-foot tall plateau jutting up from the ground in an otherwise flat area of the
Wood. The structures atop it are hidden from view by the Wood’s vegetation,
which grew over it in the two millennia since the city crashed. The Shadovar led
by Prince Clariburnus use Xinlenal as their main base of operations in the
region, and are hard at work trying to make it fly again.</p>

<h3 id="the-forest-of-hides">The Forest of Hides</h3>

<p>The Gray Wolf recognize this is the center of Netherese power even though they
don’t know what goes on in here. So when they declared war on the Forsworn, they
started hanging up the skins of their “traitorous kinfolk” in a clearing outside
the plateau. This acts as both a warning to enemies and as a show of support for
their new masters.</p>

<p>Ironically, the sheer brutality of this practice has led many rank-and-file Gray
Wolf to question their leadership, and the horrible smell of dead werewolf
lingering about the place acts as a cover for Forsworn spies and makes it easier
for them to scout the plateau.</p>

<p>The act of building the Forest of Hides outraged and horrified many of the
primal spirits who used to be friends of the Grey Wolf. If the Pack Outcast,
Uthgardt Barbarian, or any other PC who uses primal powers dismantle the Forest
of Hides, those spirits will reward them with a daily power named <strong>Wrath of the
Fallen</strong>, which can be activated after an attack hits and makes the target
vulnerable 5 to all damage (save ends), including that of the triggering
attack. Once the target saves, they take another 10 damage.</p>

<p>Here you see the first instance of what I talked about in the intro paragraphs
above. There’s more below.</p>

<h3 id="the-city-and-the-web-of-stone">The City and the Web of Stone</h3>

<p>The walls of the plateau are a sheer climb, but they look natural after two
millennia of weathering. Some flying monsters even made lairs there. The city at
the top looks completely ruined when viewed from the plateau’s edge.</p>

<p>Those moving towards the center will soon spot a massive suspended “web” made of
stone looming over the skyline. This acts as a gigantic crane and construction
tool used in the Shadovar’s renovation efforts. It can lift whole city blocks
for relocation, or remove an equivalent quantity of soil and vegetation to
reveal the structures buried beneath. Workers both organic and artificial are
constantly swarming all over it.</p>

<p>This web was built by the shadar-kai witch Korvina, who realized she could use
residual energy from the city’s old protection rituals to power it. Later she
would find out she was actually drawing power from the city’s broken mythallar
and delaying its repairs. When her bosses found out about the oopsie, she
managed to pin the blame for it on her colleague Qualthus, whose fate we’ll
learn in a future post.</p>

<h3 id="the-womb-of-stone">The Womb of Stone</h3>

<p>Gee, these Netherese sure have a knack for naming things, don’t they?</p>

<p>This building is an ancient construct factory reactivated by the Shadovar. This
is where they build all the thaalud constructs they’re using as a workforce. The
ones they build today aren’t as powerful as the ones from ancient Netheril
(using the thaalud constructor stat block from earlier in this book), but they
can do their job just fine.</p>

<p>The Womb of Stone is run and operated by a shade named Ulrukan (stats as a human
slaver with shade traits). His left arm and leg are animated prosthetic
constructs, which I think is awesome. Ulrukan discovered the problem with the
Web of Stone before anyone else, decided to keep it to himself until he could
gain something by revealing it, and lost the chance to do so when other people
found the issue and reported it immediately. Now that it’s public he’s trying to
figure out how to extract some advantage from the fact that he knew it before
anyone else did. I don’t think he knows it’s Korvina’s fault, or he’d already be
blackmailing her.</p>

<h3 id="cathedral-of-night">Cathedral of Night</h3>

<p>This is a ancient building repurposed as a temple to the goddess Shar. The
exterior is still ruined and worn, but the interior is very fancy and all done
up in onyx and jet. It’s also protected by enchanted hungry shadows, a very
interesting hazard that can temporarily remove PCs from play and cause ongoing
psychic and necrotic damage to them while they’re gone. This security protects
the usual temple treasures and also a portal to the Shadowfell, which is used by
the Shadovar to access their supply routes.</p>

<p>Orthinos Eln is the priest in charge of both the temple and the restoration
project. He can be found here either meditating or communing with his boss
Prince Clariburnus, who leads the faction as a whole.</p>

<h3 id="xinlenals-heart">Xinlenal’s Heart</h3>

<p>The city’s <em>mythallar</em> is located at its very center. The tower that houses it
was the first building to be completely restored, and a small army of Shadovar
artificers is now busy restoring the artifact itself.</p>

<p>The restoration process is simple to describe but very hard to execute. It
consists of mixing melted glass with large quantities of residuum, carefully
pouring the resulting substance over the <em>mythallar</em>, and molding it so that it
slowly recovers its original spherical shape. Right now it looks like a partial
sphere, already over 100 feet (30 meters!) in diameter.</p>

<p>This is why the Netherese are scouring the region’s many ruins and dungeons for
magic items and other ancient enchanted relics, and also why they’re poised to
begin raiding Neverwinter. All of that loot is going to get destroyed for its
residuum. The Shadovar are burning the legacies of others to rebuild their own.</p>

<p>The central tower is also where their main war room is located, as well as
Clariburnus’ quarters and throne room. He can either be found here coordinating
the faction’s overall strategy, or somewhere out in the world leading another
raid for magic items. He also sometimes brings members of the Gray Wolf
leadership here for briefings.</p>

<h2 id="vellosk">Vellosk</h2>

<p>This is the main “settlement” of the Gray Wolf tribe, located in the Wood away
from Xinlenal. The quotes are there because they are mostly nomadic, and this is
just where a few more permanent structures are built - pack leader’s homes, a
feast hall, and some other communal buildings. You can also find a number of
tents and lean-tos scattered around the area, belonging to other tribe members
who are currently staying there.</p>

<p>The book says the Grey Wolf have the technology to make weapons and tools as
sophisticated as that of Neverwinter, but that they have no real culture to
speak of beyond an obsession with behaving like D&amp;D’s idea of a wolf pack. It
could be that this is what the current leadership thinks, but the way the book
phrases it kinda makes me think this is what they were like even before.</p>

<p>Vellosk’s central feature is a sloped pit whose bottom is coated in dry bones,
and also contains a totem pole decorated with animal skulls. This is their
center of worship, dedicated to Uthgar and the tribe’s guardian spirits. It’s
also where ritual combats and duels happen.</p>

<p>One of the permanent structures here is the home of Ormshas, a dark creeper
necromancer who is here officially as a Netherese ambassador and in reality as a
spy placed to make sure the Grey World remain under control. She has a large
group of wraiths under her control, which she uses to uncover secrets and
silence dissenters.</p>

<h3 id="the-gray-wolf-and-the-pcs">The Gray Wolf and the PCs</h3>

<p>A lot of the rank-and-file Grey Wolf are very unhappy with the direction the
tribe is taking, but they also believe their leaders’ commands are absolute and
those leaders have been completely bought the Netherese party line. Many tribe
members would rather leave than try to challenge their leaders, but these days
those who express a desire to leave are executed on the spot.</p>

<p>PCs such as the Pack Outcast or the Uthgardt Barbarian would have an easier time
convincing the Grey Wolf to reject their leadership, but they would still need
to challenge those leaders to ritual combat and win (or convince/help a friendly
Gray Wolf to do so). Ritual combat is, of course, to the death.</p>

<p>Making a legitimate challenge would also require convincing a majority of the
tribe that their leaders are being bamboozled by the Netherese. Just going for
the leaders at once is a sure way to get the whole tribe to declare war on you
no matter what they think about those leaders, so it’s not a good option for
most groups.</p>

<h2 id="conyberry">Conyberry</h2>

<p>Conyberry is a small village at the edge of the Wood that became quite scenic
during the Spellplague when a populated slice of Abeir was isekaied there. It
gained a new lake, a bunch of floating earthmotes, and a mixed population that
learned to live well together after some initial friction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately you don’t get to see that version of it, because the Grey Wolf
killed everyone long before the Netherese even got to them. According to the
book they believed the people from Abeir to be hostile invaders and the people
of Conyberry to be their co-conspirators.</p>

<p>The Gray Wolf used the now empty village as a storage area for a time. No one
else went there because everyone (rightly) assumed it had been destroyed after
news stopped coming, and when someone did stumble into the place they were
killed.</p>

<p>When the Netherese recruited them they started using the village to, in the
words of the book, “practice civilized behavior” so that they would blend into
the communities they were ordered to infiltrate. Now when outsiders end up there
by accident they’re received by a bunch of Gray Wolf in sheep’s clothing eager
to test their acting skills. Only after the actors are satisfied, or when
they’re found out, do the murder attempts start.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Xinlenal itself seems like a good dungeon location. A final battle against
Caliburnus in the <em>mythallar</em> chamber would look awesome.</p>

<p>But everything about the description of the Gray Wolf kinda ruins it. The text
is filled with the exact set of racist tropes that draw so much criticism to
D&amp;D. I’m left with the distinct impression that the Gray Wolf are described as
being bad <em>because they’re tribal</em>, in contrast to the “civilized” people they
disdain and victimize. Yikes!</p>

<p>That’s definitely something I’d completely rewrite if I ever ran a campaign in
this setting. It actually kinda tainted the good memories I had of this book,
and made me stop writing new Let’s Read material for it for a while.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In the gloomiest and darkest part of the Wood, there’s a perfectly circular
clearing whose ground is ash. None of the Wood’s animals dare enter this
place. This is where the Dread Ring was built. It was both a fortress and a
ritual tool for a grand spell that would have turned Szass Tam into a
god. Though the spell failed, the ruined fortress now serves as the main base
for the Thayans in the region.</p>

<p>The entire area of the Ring, both indoors and outdoors, is <em>super cursed</em>. Check
it out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It counts as both defiled and necrotic ground, the rules for which are found
in the DMG 2. Basically, undead are boosted and HP gains from spending healing
surges are halved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Powers with either the arcane or necrotic keywords crit on 19-20. Powers with
both keywords crit on 18-20. This is one of the only instances of “critical
range” boosting in the entire game, it’s an extremely rare bonus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creatures take -1 to Will against powers or effects with the fear keyword.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Since this is also Lorragauth’s grave, some smaller areas in here might also
count as acid-based fonts of power or elemental spouts, making them even more
hazardous.</p>

<h3 id="the-ring-from-the-outside-in">The Ring from the Outside In</h3>

<p>Frequent clashes between Shadovar and Thayan forces have turned the outer areas
of the clearing into a blood-soaked battlefield littered with corpses.</p>

<p>Inside the ruined outer walls is the <strong>Flesh Factory</strong>, where corpses,
body parts, and sometimes living victims are stored and used as materials for
Thayan necromancy and flesh-shaping projects. The place’s design lets it raise
undead at a much faster pace and a much larger scale than usual, effectively
mass-producing them. This is where most of the Thayan undead are made, and also
the facility in charge of repairing the fortress’ walls. Instead of bothering
with the logistics of procuring and shipping stone, they decided to patch the
walls with slabs of undead flesh. These walls get a stat block as a trap,
because they can sprout grabby hands that deal damage.</p>

<p>Past the Factory are the <strong>halls of the fortress</strong>, which follow no plan a
living mind would consider sane since their main purpose was to act as a ritual
tool.</p>

<p>The center is open, and it’s the current site of the <strong>Thayan excavation</strong>
that’s trying to reach Lorragauth’s resting place. They’ve managed to reach his
bones and partially unearthed them already, but there’s plenty of work to do
before they’re free of the soil. The excavation pit is deep and hazardous, and
the book has rules for navigating it and for operating the many cranes installed
here during combat to either drop rocks on enemies or slam the crane arm into
them.</p>

<p>The undead workforce here doubles as the Dread Ring’s garrison, so they get
depleted to a, er, skeleton crew when the Netherese attack. They’re overseen by
Praddak, an battle wight (stats in DMG 2). Also here as protection is the sacred
totem of the Thunderbeast tribe, which as we saw before was a fossilized
thunderbeast skeleton. It’s been animated by necromancy, with the stats of a
rotclaw (an undead monster from the Draconomicon). This of course is a horrible
blasphemy, particularly to the Uthgardt Barbarian PC.</p>

<p>Somewhere near the pit is the <strong>Dread Spire</strong>, the tallest surviving tower of
the Ring. It houses the Thayan war room, the entrance to Valindra’s sanctum, and
a perpetually dark room that contains a portal to the Shadowfell. It also
contains the Chapel of the Dragon, where Kroskas’ cultists research how to raise
Lorragauth as a dracolich.</p>

<p>The Shadowfell portal is what lets the Thayans bring corpses from Neverdeath
Cemetery for reanimation, and to receive caravans that come from Surcross via
the Shadowfell Road.</p>

<p><strong>Valindra’s Sanctum</strong> houses her library and an arcane observatory that lets
someone scry remote locations and perform astrological divination. It’s operated
by Lurrens, one of her lieutenants, who watches it 24/7. Lurrens is a former
wizard who was turned into an undead Brain in an Armored Jar (from Open Grave).</p>

<p>The observatory’s grinding machinery is hazardous terrain, should a fight break
out here. PCs might find information on Gauntlgrym and other campaign secrets by
either researching Valindra’s library or learning how to operate the
observatory.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Contrary to my earlier expectations the Dread Ring cannot rise as a floating
battlestation or giant undead mech, though the possibility of them raising a
dracolich is a decent substitute. The place is perfectly usable as an endgame
dungeon, though it could also end up being “just” an important stop on the way
to Gauntlgrym depending on the campaign’s focus.</p>

<p>And I have to say “Brain in an Armored Jar” is the best monster name ever.</p>

            <h2 id="historical-errata">Historical Errata</h2>

<p>Before I continue, I feel a correction is in order. This one’s on me, not on the
book, since it was a detail from that long and detailed timeline at the start
that I missed. I’m correcting it here because it will be important later.</p>

<p>As we already know, Shandarar was the former capital of Iliyanbruen, an
elven/eladrin empire that existed in this region thousands of years ago. It
coexisted with the human empire of Netheril, and witnessed its fall when the
flying city of Xinlenal fell on the Neverwinter Wood.</p>

<p>The bit I got wrong was this: the fall of Xinlenal did not also cause the end of
Iliyanbruen. The crash site was far from the city, and though the elves explored
it soon after the event they decided to declare it off-limits after the first
few explosions and carried on with their lives.</p>

<p>Iliyanbruen would last for a few centuries longer. They’d manage to repel a
massive orc invasion that covered the North, but their kingdom would collapse
from the effort it spent to kick those same orcs out of the human city of Illusk
(located where Luskan is today). From here on out things proceed as previously
detailed, with the empire’s population scattering and some of them deciding to
take refuge in the Feywild.</p>

<h2 id="present-day-shandarar">Present-Day Shandarar</h2>

<p>The middle world ruins of Shandarar cover a sizable area in the Wood but were
mostly hidden by the passage of time and the growth of vegetation. Sometimes a
farmer at the edges of the forest would find shards of pottery as they plowed a
field, or some village builders would end up unearthing a ruined
structure. These rumors helped the Netherese find the core of the ruins and
steal a bunch of ancient relics from it, which has the eladrin in a tizzy as we
already learned.</p>

<p>Most of the ruins are still, well, ruins. They’re overgrown and weathered enough
to be hazardous. The oldest part of them, however, is being rebuilt and
renovated by the eladrin, since that’s where they crossed over from the Feywild.</p>

<p>The biggest news here is that there are still several shielded vaults in the
ruins that haven’t been found out by anyone yet. They contain extensive troves
of ancient Iliyanbruen artifacts and works of art, of immense cultural value
even when they aren’t magical, all protected against the ravages of time by
stasis spells. The eladrin themselves don’t remember their locations, and this
is the first time the book itself mentions them.</p>

<p>Here is also where it goes into a little more detail on the Feywild side of the
crossing. That’s where the military outpost of New Shandarar is. It was also
built on top of ruins, after the eladrin force kicked out the evil fey that had
been living in them.</p>

<p>New Shandarar’s fortifications are living vegetation shaped by magic, and the
portal opens into a courtyard kill zone. Aside from all the military defenses
you expect, built of out living and magically reinforced wood, the fort also has
plenty of facilities for long-term habitation. This includes a temple to
Corellon.</p>

<h2 id="the-hidden-serpent">The Hidden Serpent</h2>

<p>As we saw before, Merrisara Winterwhite, the force’s commanding officer, is part
of their moderate faction. She spends most of her time in the middle world
overseeing the restoration of the city. Her second-in-command is an extremist,
and spends all of his time in the Feywild. Addemios Three-Dawn, the secret
Asmodeus worshiper, also spends all his time in the Feywild. He has a hidden
shrine to his god underneath Corellon’s temple. The evil fey who were
supposedly kicked out of the area have a hidden camp not too far from the fort,
and they cooperate with Three-Dawn because their interests align.</p>

<p>A side box here explains that Asmodeus presents himself in the Feywild as a
trickster god of a “better class” than the usual archetypes found there. Instead
of lying and cheating for the lulz, he encourages and teaches his followers to
do so in order to advance their own power and influence.</p>

<h2 id="the-fey-and-the-pcs">The Fey and the PCs</h2>

<p>Another box discusses the possible attitudes of the eladrin towards PCs. As we
already known even the moderates are standoffish and aggressive to outsiders by
default. However, they are likely have a more diplomatic stance towards a party
which includes the Iliyanbruen Guardian.</p>

<p>Which of the two sub-factions wins out depends largely on the actions of the
PCs. The moderates win and might become valuable allies if the PCs can offer
them evidence that the Shadovar are responsible for the relic thefts, or if they
can prove Addemios Three-Dawn is a traitor who is manipulating them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the PCs steal from the ruins, fight the eladrin or attack
Three-Dawn before proving his guilt, the Fey will adopt the extremist stance and
launch a full-scale invasion of the region, likely starting a major open war
with the other factions.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>How important the fey of New Shandarar are depends entirely on what the group
wants for their campaign. They could be anywhere from isolated and irrelevant to
a potential region-wide threat that needs to be defused as soon as
possible. Even groups who aren’t interested in spending a lot of time dealing
with these elves might still get an adventure or two out of a visit to their
camp, perhaps as they’re traveling the Wood on the way to some other location
therein.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The Neverwinter Wood dominates the northern half of our regional map and is much
larger than the city that gives it its name. It’s a classic Creepy Forest, where
the canopies block out all sunlight and even in the safer trails it seems like
someone is always watching you from the shadows. And that’s just the baseline
mood - the Wood is also currently full of ill-intentioned outsiders.</p>

<p>Characters in a Neverwinter campaign might need to trek through this place for
any number of reasons. This section of the chapter covers some of the Wood’s
most notable places, but it’s large enough that you could run a full
hex-crawling campaign on it.</p>

<p>The book actually includes rules for a “Creepy Woods” hazardous terrain type
that can be included in exploration or combat maps. Anyone on this terrain when
a fight starts must roll a save before rolling Initiative - if they fail,
they’re surprised during the first round. They also gain a -2 to Will while on
Creepy spaces and when they fail a Perception check there they always think they
heard something that’s not there.</p>

<p>This first post covers the “smaller” areas and “standard” geographical features
of the Woods. It also contains several faction strongholds that will each get
their own post.</p>

<h2 id="the-crags">The Crags</h2>

<p>This is a large mountain range that splits the Wood in two, running from NE to
SW. Mount Hotenow is the most notable place in the Crags, as it’s where the
Neverwinter River starts and also the source of the eruption that caused the
cataclysm.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more besides the volcano though - this is a typical D&amp;D mountain
range full of monsters, caves, and hidden valleys and is also rumored to contain
paths to lost Gauntlgrym. Whether those exist or not, the range does definitely
contain a lot of old Delzoun outposts.</p>

<p>Those outposts will give the Heir of Delzoun something to marvel at even if they
don’t find a path to the lost city here. They’re also targets for Netherese
plundering in their unceasing quest for magic items to burn.</p>

<h2 id="iceless-waterways">Iceless Waterways</h2>

<p>All of the Wood’s rivers are warmed by Hotenow’s heat, so they never freeze even
during winter, and generally act to keep the forest warm and untouched by the
seasons. They teem with non-monstrous aquatic wildlife but never gave rise to
monsters - except for the River Morgur, the northernmost tributary of the
Neverwinter. It’s still iceless, but also has river monsters.</p>

<h2 id="bones-of-thundertree">Bones of Thundertree</h2>

<p>Thundertree used to be a logging village that produced a lot of quality
timber. It was completely destroyed by the eruption, and all of its surviving
inhabitants fled to never return. The place is now haunted by possessed plant
monsters (take plant monster stat blocks of your choice and give them undead
traits). Aside from them, only the dwarf Favria, leader of the more violent
faction of the Ashmadai, calls this place home. She lives in an underground wine
cellar.</p>

<p>I was given to understand her whole Ashmadai sub-faction used this place as a
base, so it looks like there was a miscommunication between different authors
here. I’d probably add them here if I ran a Neverwinter campaign. Maybe say
those plant monsters are possessed by <em>devils</em> instead of undead. How do you
like evil treants with 20 fire resistance?</p>

<h2 id="the-tower-of-twilight">The Tower of Twilight</h2>

<p>There used to be a wizard’s tower built in the middle of a lake island. It, and
the bridge leading to it, only appeared at night, becoming more solid as the sun
set and fading out again when it rose. During the Spellplague, the tower
vanished entirely and did not return until after the cataclysm. Now, it appears
sporadically with no set schedule, and no one knows what goes on in there
anymore.</p>

<p>One suggestion from the book is that the tower fades out of <em>time</em> when it’s not
visible in the physical world, and the people inside only experience the passage
of time when it appears. This mean that the tower’s wizard and their apprentices
and staff might still be there, either absorbed in their studies as if this was
still 3e or struggling with what is to them a very recent bout of “original
strain” Spellplague.</p>
