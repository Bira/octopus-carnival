            <p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Remember when I told you the MM3 had the very good idea of giving each devil and
demon its own entry rather than lumping them all together? Here’s where they
kinda toss that out the window and make a big entry full of diverse stat blocks
for a single type of devil.</p>

<p>Corruption Devils, or Paeliryons, first appeared in one of the later Monster
Manuals for 3rd Edition. I remember they were not very well-received because
their lore and appearance had some quite unfortunate implications. This book is
still making an effort to make them a big part of the game, so let’s see if the
lore improved in any way.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The book describes these devils as “bloated infernal masterminds of graft,
sleaze, and vice”. They’re better at politics and intrigue than almost anyone
else in Hell, and they put that skill to use in subverting mortal societies to
their benefit, turning them into decadent kleptocracies via a network of agents
and dupes. Most paeliryons work for Dispater, lord of the second layer of Hell,
acting as the civil administration of that wretched city.</p>

<p>A corruption devil’s agent network is somewhat inverted from what you’d
expect. Its most powerful members are kept at a safe remove from the devil,
while those that work directly with it are ignorant sycophants and expendable
muscle.</p>

<p>I see that they kept the Paeliryion illustration from the previous edition, but
if I’m remembering it correctly the lore was changed to something a little less
problematic. With an extra decade of hindsight, I’d probably replace the Ursula
cosplay with a big suit and an orange wig.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<h3 id="corruption-devil">Corruption Devil</h3>

<figure class="center">

<p>The basic model, depicted in the illustration. These are most likely to be found
running the city of Dis, but can also go out into the other planes to perform
specific missions. Though physically imposing, the creatures prefer to avoid
direct conflicts, and will try to negotiate their way out of trouble. If forced
into combat they fight like PC bards, staying away from the melee and hurling
magically-charged insults and mind control spells at their enemies.</p>

<p>They pal around with other manipulative devils such as succubi, vizier devils,
and cambions, though these are almost always pawns rather than full allies. If
things see to be going bad for it, the paeliryion will definitely fly away and
abandon its “friends”.</p>

<p>Corruption Devils are Large Immortal Humanoids (Devils), and Level 22
Controllers (Leaders) with 208 HP. They have Darkvision and a +5 to save against
fear and charm effects. Their ground speed is only 4, but they’re excellent
fliers with speed 6 (hover).</p>

<p>These devils project a <strong>Corruptive Presence</strong> that works as an aura (5) and
inflicts a -2 penalty to saves on all enemies inside its radius. It fights in
melee with <strong>Corrupting Claws</strong> and at range with <strong>Words of Corruption</strong>, both
of which deal no immediate damage and instead inflict ongoing psychic damage
(save ends).</p>

<p>Their mind control magic takes the form of two minor-action spells. <strong>Sway the
Corrupt</strong> (at-will) targets an enemy that’s taking ongoing psychic damage. It
hits automatically, and dominates them for a turn. <strong>Doom the Corrupt</strong>
(recharge 5+) targets an ally or a dominated creature, forcing them to make a
melee basic attack against an enemy of the devil’s choice. If that attack hits,
its target is also immobilized (save ends).</p>

<p>Finally, it can use <strong>Desperate Measures</strong> as a minor action to allow an ally to
make a basic attack that crits on 19-20, in exchange for the ally granting
combat advantage for a turn. This recharges when the devil is first bloodied,
and if used while it’s bloodied it applies to every ally within 5 squares
instead of just one.</p>

<h3 id="sire-of-corruption">Sire of Corruption</h3>

<p>These are the most powerful corruption devils, and among some of the most
powerful devils in Hell. They’re the ones who run long term projects of the
“turn a whole kingdom to evil” variety, and have a particular strong hatred of
“incorruptible” people or institutions, working extra-hard to prove that
assertion wrong or destroy these offenders if they can’t. Sires of Corruption
can make a particular kind of infernal contract that can make the signing mortal
gain power from utterly embracing their vices, thought they still remain pawns
of the devil in the end.</p>

<p>These creatures are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils), and Level 29 Elite
Controllers (leaders) with 530 HP. They have 15 fire resistance and a ground
speed of 6, but no special senses.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Lasting Corruption</strong> aura is actually a bit worse than that of a basic
corruption devil, since the save penalty only applies to charm effects. All of
their non-basic attacks are charm effects, so it doesn’t make a difference to
the sire itself, but it’s less helpful to its allies.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Corrupting Touch</strong> that does a sizable amount of
psychic damage and inflicts a -2 penalty to defenses against charm effects for a
turn, so you want to alternate it with the other attack: <strong>Touch of Vice</strong>
(recharge 4+), which deals the same amount of psychic damage and inflicts one of
<em>six</em> possible effects named after different vices or sins. They’re all (save
ends), and have the following effects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lust</strong> causes the target to be marked by another enemy within 5 squares.</li>
  <li><strong>Excess</strong> dazes.</li>
  <li><strong>Greed</strong> slides the target 5 squares to a space adjacent to one of its
allies, and forces it to make opportunity attacks against allies whose actions
would provoke them.</li>
  <li><strong>Fear</strong> pushes the target 5 squares and forbids it from moving closer to the
sire of corruption.</li>
  <li><strong>Sloth</strong> immobilizes.</li>
  <li><strong>Vengeance</strong> auto-damages the target whenever they use an attack power.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sire chooses which effect happens whenever it hits with Touch of Vice.</p>

<p>But that’s not all! At the start of the fight it can issue a <strong>Call to
Corruption</strong> to summon six Corrupted Followers into the fight, and it can do
that again after it’s bloodied! As a minor action it can use <strong>Spread
Depravity</strong> to give one of these servants a free attack.</p>

<p>And finally, when the sire is reduced to 0 HP, it uses a final attack named
<strong>Lasting Vice</strong>, which targets everyone in a Close Burst 5 with a Touch of
Vice (same damage, same choice of effects).</p>

<p>These things are nasty, and unlike basic corruption devils they want to get
right into the fray while surrounded by their corrupted servants.</p>

<p>These are mortals who were prey to some vice in life, and who were offered a
very specific kind of infernal contract in their moment of greatest despair or
misery. The contract gives them what they desire, and immediately afterwards
turns them into monsters made of the same vice that controlled their mortal
lives.</p>

<p>Followers retain no memory of those lives. Left to their own devices, they
contrive to spread their ruling vice among the surrounding population. Most
often, though, they’re found in the service of their devil master. Usually this
is a Sire of Corruption, but it can also be some other powerful devil, or some
mortal villain to whom the fiend has loaned them.</p>

<p>Corrupted Followers are epic-tier minions, and there’s a different variety for
every vice a Sire of Corruption can generate. It’s entirely appropriate for the
Sire’s Call to Corruption power to summon a full sentai team with the six
varieties, but you can vary its composition to have simpler combats.</p>

<p>Each Follower type has a touch attack that targets Will and does a bit of damage
with a rider, an effect that happens when it dies, and sometimes an aura or
passive trait. All of those will be related to each Follower’s Thematic
Vice. Here they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lust</strong>: Corrupted Lechers are Level 24 Minion Lurkers. They can’t be
targeted unless they’re the closest enemy to the attacker; their attacks can
be melee or ranged, and make the target be marked by another enemy for a turn;
when they die, they make their killer move its speed towards another enemy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Excess</strong>: Corrupted Gluttons are Level 25 Minion Soldiers that attack with
bites that also grab the target. Once they have a target grabbed they can chew
on them for automatic damage. When they die, they curse their killer to take
damage next turn unless the PC recovers HP in the intervening time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Greed</strong>: Corrupted Mongers are Level 26 Minion Artillery. Their melee
attacks slide the target adjacent to one of their allies; their ranged attack
drain daily or encounter powers from magic items until the end of the
encounter! When they die, they cause any daily or encounter powers from the
item that killed them to become spent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sloth</strong>: Corrupted Idlers are Level 27 Minion Soldiers. They have a small
slowing aura, and their attacks prevent the target from taking move actions
for a turn. When they die, they make an attack against the killer’s Will that
will knock the PC unconscious for a turn on a hit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vengeance</strong>: Corrupted Lunatics are Level 28 Minion Brutes. Their attacks
are weak even for a minion, but force the target to make a basic attack
against its nearest ally. If someone misses then with an attack, they can make
a free attack against that PC, with the same rider as above. When they die,
their killer must again make an attack against an ally. They’re walking Three
Stooges skits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fear</strong>: Corrupted Cravens are Level 29 Minion Controllers. When they hit
with an attack, they force the target to move its speed away from them. The
same happens to their killer when they die.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I guess I’m still not entirely sold on the whole “Corruption Devil” lore. It
feels kinda redundant because this sort of thing was already supposed to be one
of the central themes for Hell as a whole. And the stat blocks use the word
“Corruption” so much it kinda starts to lose its meaning. The Sire of Corruption
seems like it was an entirely different monster that got retrofitted into this
entry. It’s obviously inspired by the Seven Deadly Sins, which I feel is kinda
played out. But at least it’s all seven in one monster, and it <em>is</em> in-theme for
Hell.</p>

<p>Mechanics-wise, the Corruption Devil stat block might work quite well for any
bard-type enemies, with a few minor adjustments. The Sire of Corruption is a
scary combatant, but its mechanics are extremely tied to the concept of sin so
it might be harder to reskin. It would make an excellent basis for an Aspect of
Asmodeus, though!</p>

<p>The minions are flavorful, but fiddly. I wouldn’t recommend using the full
spread in the same encounter.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Derro have been in the game since AD&amp;D 1st Edition, where they appeared in the
Monster Manual II. They’re based on the writings of an American author named
Richard Sharpe Shaver, who wrote a lot about a civilization of psychic and
torture-obsessed underground humanoids he named the dero (from “Detrimental
Robots”).</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>D&amp;D Derro have a different origin from Shaver’s dero, though the flavor is quite
similar in 4e. When the world was still young, it gave rise to an advanced and
power-hungry civilization. Its people, the derro, craved power like that of the
primordials, but they wanted to bow to no master. So derro scholars came up with
an alternate solution: open a portal to this unoccupied magic-rich dimension
they found. There would be no one to contest their claim! Free unlimited power!</p>

<p>They succeeded in opening their portals, but found out this new dimension was
far from unoccupied. It was the place known today as the Far Realm. After the
derro beheld what came through to greet them, they suddenly realized they had
finally found a master worth worshiping. In other words, their sanity was
blasted to dust.</p>

<p>Derro civilization became so horrifying in its depravity that the World Serpent,
one of the most powerful primal spirits, coiled around it and dragged the entire
thing underground. This stopped their grand machinations but did not destroy
them. Many centuries later, a drow expedition found the ruins of the derro
empire, and what the derro became in the dark. Only one of their number made it
home… mostly. Her report convinced the drow these maniacs must be
eradicated, but this is harder than it looks.</p>

<p>In our narrative present, derro live in small groups that crawl around the ruins
of their old cities, and worship the energies and beings of the Far
Realm. They’re enthusiastic slavers, going on frequent raids to the surface or
to other Underdark communities to find new captives. They treat these slaves
badly, torturing them for fun and killing them for the smallest of offenses. The
slaves, in turn, will turn on their captors as soon as the smallest chance to
escape presents itself.</p>

<p>Derro are only capable of making true alliances with beings from the Far Realm,
suck as grells, mind flayers, and aboleths (whom they sometimes
worship). They despise everyone else, and everyone else hates them right
back.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Derro are statted up as mid-Paragon threats, suitable for inclusion in encounter
groups that feature their preferred allies listed above. The entry also gives
enough Derro stat blocks to make decent all-Derro encounters.</p>

<p>Derro are Small Aberrant Humanoids. They have Darkvision, and their signature
ability is named <strong>Strength of Madness</strong>. It’s an encounter power that lets them
roll a d6 and add the result to all of their attack rolls until the end of their
next turn, but also makes them grant combat advantage during this time.</p>

<h3 id="derro-warrior">Derro Warrior</h3>

<p>Combatants like these typically make up the patrols that keep derro territory
“secure” by engaging in preemptive attacks against its neighbors. Gotta keep
them guessing, y’know.</p>

<p>Warriors are Level 13 Artillery with 101 HP and all standard Derro traits. Their
speed is 5, and they have a +2 to saves against fear effects. They carry daggers
and a repeating hand crossbows with several magazines.</p>

<p>The <strong>dagger</strong> is their default melee attack, and they can fire the <strong>Repeating
Hand Crossbow</strong> as a minor action, or use a standard action to let loose a
<strong>Bolt Spray</strong> (recharge 5+) that hits a Close Blast 5 for heavy damage and
pushes 1 square on a hit. Any of these will deal extra damage against targets
granting combat advantage.</p>

<p>Bolt Spray is not selective, and most derro warriors don’t particularly care if
their allies are caught in its area of effect. They’ll use it whenever possible.</p>

<h3 id="derro-thug">Derro Thug</h3>

<p>This can be a less capable warrior, or just your average civilian
psychopath. Derro thugs are Level 14 Minion Brutes and they fight with
clubs. Their only special ability is <strong>Mad Sacrifice</strong>: when the thug misses an
attack, it can sacrifice itself to turn the miss into a hit.</p>

<p>Using them in combat is simple: get a whole bunch of them to charge the PCs and
hit whoever’s closest, using Mad Sacrifice liberally.</p>

<h3 id="derro-fanatic">Derro Fanatic</h3>

<p>Warriors that display notable skill and potential are invited by Derro savants
to peer directly into the Far Realm. Those who remain functional after the
experience use this stat block.</p>

<p>Fanatics are Level 14 Skirmishers with 140 HP. They carry battleaxes into
combat. Their basic <strong>axe</strong> attack has an attached effect that allows them to
end any mark on themselves and shift 2 squares before making the attack roll.</p>

<p>If they bloody an enemy, their <strong>Insane Bloodlust</strong> allows them to immediately
make another attack against that same enemy. And while a fanatic is themselves
bloodied, <strong>Unleashed Madness</strong> gives them a -2 attack penalty and 2d6 bonus
damage.</p>

<p>That effect on their basic attack allows them to slip right past the party’s
front line and go for the squishies, and by the time they get there they might
even have turned into mini-brutes. Fanatics always fight to the death.</p>

<h3 id="derro-harvester">Derro Harvester</h3>

<p>This derro is specialized in capturing slaves, a very important function in
derro society. They always need more people to do the labor derro consider
beneath themselves, and to act as experimental subjects.</p>

<p>Harvesters are Level 15 Lurkers with 116 HP. They wield war picks and carry a
set of shackles. Their attacks do bonus damage if the target is granting them
combat advantage.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a strike with the <strong>pick</strong> and has no special effects, but
they have a frightening power named <strong>Harvest</strong>. To use it, the derro must have
started its turn hidden from the target. It’s an attack against Fortitude, which
does no damage but <em>knocks the target unconscious</em> (save ends).</p>

<p>The harvester can them use its <strong>shackles</strong> to bind the helpless victim, which
from that point on is restrained and falls prone whenever it’s hit with a melee
attack. The victim can try to escape by succeeding in an escape action against
the harvester (Athletics vs. Fort 27, or Acrobatics vs. Ref 28).</p>

<p>If Harvest fails or a victim gets loose, the derro can use <strong>Flee to the
Shadows</strong>, which allows it to move its full speed and make a Stealth test to
hide if it has concealment at the end of the movement.</p>

<p>The shackles can only be used once per encounter, but Harvest is at-will. So a
harvester could knock someone out, shackle them, and have its buddies drag the
victim to their base, keeping them unconscious with multiple applications of
Harvest. I guess that once they’re no longer using combat turns, the victim just
stays down until they wake up in a cell.</p>

<h3 id="derro-ironguard">Derro Ironguard</h3>

<p>Ironguards are more disciplined than your typical derro warrior, which
admittedly is not a high bar to clear. They are proficient in the use of hooked
spears, and are often employed to catch runaway slaves or guard them so they
don’t run away in the first place. Paranoid derro bigwigs (i.e, all of them)
also hire ironguards to watch their stuff.</p>

<p>Ironguards are Level 15 Soldiers with 150 HP. Their <strong>hooked spears</strong> deal extra
damage against prone targets, so they love stabbing people when they’re
down. The weapons are also used in <strong>hooking jabs</strong> attacks, which deal damage
and grab on a hit, and on non-damaging <strong>unbalancing thrusts</strong> (minor actions)
which target a grabbed creature and knock them prone on a hit.</p>

<p>Their tactics are obvious from the ability descriptions: Hooking Jab;
Unbalancing Thrust; stabstabstabstab. Send your beefy defenders to fight them,
because Unbalancing Thrust targets Fortitude.</p>

<h3 id="derro-savant">Derro Savant</h3>

<p>Our spellcasters, or more precisely psions. They preserve the old lore that gave
the original derro access to the Far Realm, and spend their time deep inside the
ruins of their empire trying to find ways to reopen the old portals. They wield
scourges in combat, and use orbs as their implements.</p>

<p>Savants are Level 16 Controllers with 154 HP. They have a ground speed of 5 and
a teleport speed of 3. Their <strong>scourges</strong> damage and inflict a -2 attack penalty
for a turn. Their basic ranged attack is <strong>Mind Scourge</strong>, which deals psychic
damage and forces the target to choose between taking 10 ongoing psychic damage
or being dazed. The chosen condition is (save ends) either way.</p>

<p>The savant can also open a mini-portal to the Far Realm with the <strong>Window to
Madness</strong> power. This creates a small zone (area burst 1) centered on an ally
within 10 squares. The zone lasts until the end of the encounter, and any
non-derro that enter the zone or ends their turn there take 10 psychic
damage. The savant can end the zone early with a minor action, in which case the
power recharges. It can also slide every creature inside the zone 2 squares as a
minor action.</p>

<h3 id="warped-slave">Warped Slave</h3>

<p>This is not a derro, but a slave that was subject to their experiments and
warped into a tentacled abomination. The stats could also be used for a generic
Thing From Beyond summoned from a derro portal or other Far Realm opening.</p>

<p>These unfortunates are Large Aberrant Humanoids and Level 16 Brutes with 193
HP. They have Speed 6 but can’t shift, and they have Darkvision.</p>

<p>The warped slave’s <strong>Disintegrating Mind</strong> works as an aura (1), which deals
psychic damage to enemies caught inside. If a derro inside the aura uses its
Strength of Madness ability, the slave gets to make a free tentacle attack.</p>

<p>This thing can <strong>Bite</strong> or use <strong>Tentacles</strong> to fight. The tentacles grab and
pull the target 1 square in addition to dealing damage. When bloodied, it gets
desperate and gains a <strong>Flailing Tentacles</strong> attack that affects all enemies in
a Close Burst 2, damaging and pulling them 1 square on a hit.</p>

<p>Warped Slaves follow the orders of their derro masters, or rampage about the
battlefield trying to attack the nearest enemies. It often amounts to the same
thing.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The whole “Shaver Mysteries” horrific underground humanoid vibe is quite
evocative, and judged on that merit alone I’d rate the derro very highly as RPG
monsters. However, in the context of D&amp;D they end up being just one more species
of evil Underdark dwellers who like slavery and torture, this time in size
Small. If I include derro in a game, I’m probably removing at least one of the
others, and maybe more.</p>

<p>Mechanically they’re okay, and you have enough here to make a whole derro-themed
dungeon. For spice, you could add aboleth leaders and mind flayer allies.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>This creature first appeared as an “Ultrodaemon” in AD&amp;D, as part of the effort
to give every alignment its own brand of outsider. In 4e, daemons lost an “a”
and became demons. We already saw some of them in the readings of earlier books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Ultrodemons are somewhat atypical among demons because they’re more about greed
than about cruelty for cruelty’s sake. They enjoy carnage and torture as much as
the next demon, but their real passion is material wealth. They command armies
of mezzodemons and nycademons, sell their mercenary services for ruinous prices,
and loot as much as they can during these operations.</p>

<p>Ultrodemons and their underlings can be found in a wide variety of places,
either under contract to some other villain, or working independently. They’re
very rarely loyal to their employers, though, and will turn on them as soon it
looks more profitable than fulfilling the contract.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>This entry only has a single stat block, for an <strong>Ultrodemon Schemer</strong>. This is
a manipulative villain who will likely only fight the PCs in a battlefield of
its own choosing and backed up by a large number of demon allies.</p>

<p>It’s a Medium Elemental Humanoid with the Demon tag, and a Level 22 Controller
(Leader) with 205 HP. It has a ground speed of 7 with Phasing, which allows it
to walk through walls. It also has Blindsight with range 5.</p>

<p>The schemer wields a <strong>longsword</strong> whose attacks deal physical damage and daze
for a turn on a hit. It can also use magic to shoot <strong>Fiery Rays</strong> that deal
fire damage. Its command ability is represented by the <strong>Demonic Authority</strong>
power, which allows each ally adjacent to the schemer to make a melee basic
attack with combat advantage as a free action. This recharges when the demon is
first bloodied.</p>

<p>To complement its sword, combat magic, and command ability, the schemer also has
a few nasty mind tricks it can use as minor actions. The first is <strong>Hypnotic
Gaze</strong> (recharge 4+) immobilizes on a hit, and has an effect that prohibits the
target from attacking the schemer for a turn. “Effects” in 4e parlance are
things that happen even on a miss.</p>

<p>The other trick is <strong>Treacherous Gaze</strong> (recharge 6+), which dominates for a
turn.</p>

<p>As its triggered actions, the schemer has a middling version of Variable
Resistance, which gives Resistance 20 but only works once per encounter. It also
has <strong>Self-Preservation</strong>, which triggers when an enemy bloodies it. It causes
the schemer to teleport and swap places with an ally within 10 squares, and
gives the ally a chance to make a free basic attack against the triggering
enemy.</p>

<p>All of this points to a demon who wants to be close to Team Monster’s
skirmishers and assassins, and who will accompany them to try to get around the
party’s front line. It things become too hot, it will bring in a soldier or
brute from its own front line to spice things up while it flees to safety.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I remain a big fan of folding daemons into demons! Mechanically, ultros work
well as “sneaky leaders”, which isn’t a combination you see very often.</p>

<p>This isn’t part of a series or anything, but it’s a random though I’ve been
having and I feel it’s worth turning into a post.</p>

<h2 id="the-thought">The Thought</h2>

<p>If I ever to a Star Wars adaptation, it’s going to be one where everybody is
Force-sensitive. Let’s do away with the absolutist “magic/no-magic” divide
inspired by D&amp;D that all the official RPGs so far have used. If the Force is
described in the source material as being in everyone, then it should <em>be</em> in in
everyone.</p>

<p>Players would not be forced to play Jedi - rather, the badassitude of their PCs
would be explained by their connection to the Force. No more of that nonsense
about how “you can still be cool even though you’re blind to the Force”. No,
you’re cool because you opened yourself to it. It’s everywhere, and getting past
a certain threshold of skill at any endeavor means becoming attuned to the
Force. By definition, any character who is PC material in the sort of heroic
story Star Wars favors is past that threshold.</p>

<p>Like, yeah, you can still be a Jedi who throws stuff around telekinetically and
parries blaster bolts with a lightsaber, but you can also be an amazing
gunfighter from the slums of Coruscant who can <em>dodge</em> blasters, react to stuff
before it happens, and make shots that ricochet from five different surfaces
before hitting some impossibly small target. And maybe both of you can jump
really high because that’s always useful.</p>

<p>There’s a set of Force-based mechanics that all PCs gets access to, even if they
have the least mystical background possible. They can use it to perform
impossible feats of skill and luck. They can have intuitions and
premonitions. Maybe they can study a mystical tradition to do more overtly
supernatural stuff, but that’s not required.</p>

<p>And maybe one of the reasons the Dark Side and the Empire are evil is that
they’re the ones who believe that only a select few elites should be given
access to the Force.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>I believe quasits have been around since AD&amp;D 1st Edition, and they’ve
re-appeared in every edition since. This is where they enter 4e.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Back when they first appeared, quasits were simply the demon equivalent of
Imps: tiny, winged, and tricksy. The only reason they were a different creature
at all is was because of the game’s insistence that demons and devils are
completely different creature types.</p>

<p>In Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fourth Edition, quasits are… the demon equivalent of
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/11/30/imp.html">Imps</a>. Still tiny, still tricksy, they’re extremely easy to summon as
familiars and live to tempt their masters into committing ever more horrible
acts of destruction. When one of these masters die, the quasit captures their
soul and takes it to its <em>true</em> master, usually a demon lord. Demons don’t need
souls, but I guess they’re tasty.</p>

<p>Quasits are usually encountered with whatever dupes they’ve managed to tempt
this time or with other, bigger, demons. Minions might include people of any
sapient species, with or without a spellcaster. They also like
arcanians. Quasits tend to remain invisible for as long as possible and let the
others do most of the work for them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Quasits are Tiny Elemental Humanoids with the Demon tag. They’re a bit stronger
than imps by default, being Level 7 Controllers with 75 HP. They have darkvision
and a fantastic ground speed of 8, though they’re not winged and can’t fly in
this edition.</p>

<p>They’re unusual among demons in that most of their attacks have a trickery and
temptation theme, to an even greater extend than an imp. This starts with their
<strong>Tempter’s Influence</strong> aura (2), which inflicts a -2 penalty to saves on
enemies caught inside. They can also become <strong>Invisible</strong> at will with a minor
action (1/round), and stay in this state until they make an attack roll.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 0 venomous <strong>bite</strong>, which does physical damage
and forces the target to grant combat advantage (save ends). Reach 0 means they
need to enter the target’s square, which they can do because they’re Tiny.</p>

<p>Their other attack is <strong>Evil Temptation</strong>, a mind-affecting spell that targets
Will and affects enemies in a Close Blast 3. This is another at-will minor
action (1/round), and though it does no damage it dazes (save ends). The
“temptation” here is that victims can choose to end the effect early by making
an attack against one of their allies!</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>So I guess quasits aren’t just demonic imps in 4e. They’re also doing some of
the succubus’ job now that she left to become a devil. PCs affected by Evil
Temptation are likely to try to shrug it off with saves at first, but if they
have a streak of unlucky rolls that friendly fire incident is going to start
feeling mighty attractive. Daze is such a serious condition after all…</p>

<p>It’s a genuine temptation mechanic! I think I only saw one other instance of
this, for the MM2’s <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/07/11/devils-02.html">Misfortune Devils</a>. Not even succubi themselves have
temptation mechanics, since their powers and “lore baggage” end up making them
better for <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/12/15/succubus.html">making PCs run away</a>. This is an at-will Blast attack, so you’ll
likely have <em>multiple</em> PCs affected by the power at any one time.</p>

<p>Quasits should fight by alternating Evil Temptation and Invisibility, and should
hang around close to “tempted” PCs while invisible to make their saves
harder. While this is happening, the quasit’s larger allies are going to have a
field day with all those dazed heroes. Brutes and artillery work well here.</p>

<p>PC tactics when fighting a group containing a quasit are very clear: crush it
<em>as soon as possible</em>. Have your party’s scouts use their high Perception to
find the invisible little bugger and smite him with close or area attacks.</p>
