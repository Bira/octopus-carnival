<p>I’ve been wanting to write this entry ever since I started doing the Let’s Read
of the first Monster Manual and Monster Vault, more than four years ago. It’s my
favorite entry in the entire book.</p>

<p>At the dawn of Nerath, a number of knights went a-questing for the fabled
Sunspire, a tower sacred to Pelor that was said to house a beautiful maiden. The
knight who found it would receive the god’s blessings and the maiden’s hand in
marriage. One such knight eventually found the tower, and went inside at the
maiden’s invitation. He was never seen again.</p>

<p>When the armies of evil encircled Gardmore Abbey, they managed to get a
messenger through the siege, carrying a map to the location of their most
precious artifacts to be delivered to the Emperor of Nerath. The messenger ran
until a thunderstorm forced him to seek shelter. He found an inn he didn’t
remember seeing before, whose rotund proprietor promised he’d find all he
desired inside. That night, the messenger laid down on his bed and was never
seen again.</p>

<p>Prince Rande the Lost of Nerath gained his noble title after tracking down and
slaying a foul doppelganger. He found it disguised as a lady of noble bearing
living in a fancy manor house. He slew the creature and took her manor for
himself, moving in with his entire household. Servants and nobles alike began
disappearing one by one, giving rise to rumors that the Prince had usurped an
innocent woman and her ghost was seeking vengenace. Finally, the Prince himself
vanished along with the whole house, leaving an empty plot of land behind and
adding “The Lost” to his titles.</p>

<p>Years after the fall of Nerath a group of dwarven adventures came to the Nentir
Vale seeking the Lost Tower of Fastormel. They found the tower, but their
initial attempts at gaining entry failed. An old dwarven wizard eventually
answered the door, claiming she hadn’t heard the visitors knock. She invited
them inside. The party’s rogue sensed something was wrong and tried to convince
his friends to stay out, but they didn’t listen to him. The last thing the rogue
heard before fleeing were the screams of his companions. When he later returned
there with a well-armed rescue party, the tower was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>Did you know that mimics never die of old age, and never stop growing?</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Yes, the Wandering Tower is a centuries-old mimic. It’s helped along by a group
of mirror mimics who play host in order to lure potential victims inside. It’s
also followed by a swarm of blood ravens who feast on any remains it
leaves. These appear in every one of the more detailed vignettes in the book
itself.</p>

<h3 id="blood-raven-swarm">Blood Raven Swarm</h3>

<p>This is a Large swarm of Tiny creatures, and a Level 14 Skirmisher with 138
HP. Blood Ravens are Natural Beasts, and their main reason for following the
tower is for access to easy meals. Their <strong>Swarm Attack</strong> aura (1) deals 10
damage to enemies caught inside, and if they start their turn on the space of a
bloodied creature they can take move actions as minor actions.</p>

<p>The swarm’s sole attack is <strong>Blood Beaks</strong>, which damages the target and weakens
it for a turn if it’s bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="mirror-mimic">Mirror Mimic</h3>

<p>This is an interesting variant of the Impersonator Mimic from the MM3. It’s
weaker and more suitable as a hench-thing for the tower, but it also has
different psychic tricks.</p>

<p>Mirror Mimics are Level 15 Lurkers with 118 HP. They have a ground Speed of 6
and Phasing, meaning they can move through walls. They attack with <strong>Slams</strong>
that do decent damage, and their main mimic power is <strong>Body Duplication</strong>. This
lets them attack the Will of an enemy. On a hit, they take the target’s form and
teleport up to 3 squares. They also create 3 duplicates of the target within 3
squares of it. The duplicates can be attacked and have the same defenses as the
mimic, but any damage destroys them. Telling them apart from the original mimic
requires a DC 35 Insight check. The mimic can make all of them move its speed
with a single minor action, and can use <strong>Body Transfer</strong> as a minor action to
discreetly switch places with a duplicate. When it does this, its next attack
deals extra damage.</p>

<p>By a strict reading of the ability, the PCs need no rolls to pinpoint their
duplicated friend - they are only required to distinguish between the original
mimic and one of its illusory duplicates. That’s not a problem, however, because
when a duplicate is destroyed, the duplicated PC takes damage as if the mimic
had hit them with an attack!</p>

<p>Body Duplication recharges when the mimic has no active duplicates, so keeping
it active is going to be its main priority. After that, it’s going to constantly
switch places with a copy and focus its attacks on the duplicated PC. It’s going
to be very annoying to fight unless the PCs can consistently make those Insight
rolls. If the party doesn’t have an Insight specialist, this thing is going to
punch above its weight.</p>

<h3 id="core-of-the-tower">Core of the Tower</h3>

<p>The Wandering Tower can replicate any medium-sized building. Once its mimic
servants have lured one or more victims inside, the Tower waits until they are
at rest with their guard down, and then its core will attack them. That’s the
part that actually does the eating and digesting, and houses the being’s vital
organs.</p>

<p>The core is a Huge Aberrant Magical Beast, smaller than the building it’s
mimicking (which will be part of the battle map!). The walls and furnishings of
the building remain part of the mimic and can also attack the PCs. This is
modeled in several different ways in this stat block and the next.</p>

<p>The Core of the Tower is a Level 18 Solo Controller with 716 HP, a ground speed
of 6 with Phasing, Darkvision and Tremorsense 10. It’s immune to domination and
has 15 acid resistance. It’s <strong>One With the Tower</strong>, meaning it can’t move out
of the Tower and is immune to any effects that would transport it
outside. Rounding out its Solo Survival Kit, we have the <strong>Undaunted</strong> trait,
which downgrades any stuns inflicted on it to dazes.</p>

<p>The core fights by extending tendrils from itself and manipulating the
surrounding terrain, which is <em>also</em> itself. Its basic attacks are Reach 3 and
consist of <strong>Slams</strong> that slide the target 3 squares and <strong>Grabs</strong> that do
almost the same amount of damage and have an escape DC of 23. It can also, as a
free action on its turn, target a grabbed PC with the <strong>Maw of Doom</strong>, sliding
it 3 squares to a space adjacent to itself or to a wall and dealing a big chunk
of acid damage. This requires an attack roll against Fortitude, but does not end
the grab.</p>

<p>The most combat-relevant minor action the core can make is use its <strong>Rippling
Architecture</strong> to attack every enemy in a Close Burst 5 and knock them prone on
a hit. It can also create additional doors on the map, which start out jammed
shut (break DC 25), or shapeshift into something suitably large, using the same
rules as an object mimic: can’t attack, has 10 resistance to all damage, DC 32
to notice it’s a mimic. It will likely start the fight this way, and the door
ability will be used to place any doors the PCs see when they enter.</p>

<h3 id="living-wall">Living Wall</h3>

<p>This is a hazard that’s sure to be present on any fight against the Wandering
Tower, since it represents its non-core natural weapons. The book recommends
choosing 8 contiguous squares of wall on the map and designating them as this
hazard. Pseudopods and acidic maws extend from this wall to attack PCs when it
activates.</p>

<p>The Living Wall is a Level 18 Hazard that has slightly lower defenses than the
mimic’s core, and 25 HP per square (200 for those 8 recommended squares). It’s
very tough, being immune to necrotic, poison, psychic and ongoing damage, as
well as to all forced movement and conditions. It has Resist 10 acid.</p>

<p>Its attack is Reach 3 and though it deals only light physical damage it has
cruel riders: hit targets are pulled 1 square, restrained, and take 10 ongoing
acid damage (save ends both). It can attack two targets with one action, and
each attack can originate from any of the wall’s squares.</p>

<p>A square that takes 25 damage is destroyed and can no longer serve as the origin
point for an attack, though I guess it still blocks perception and movement. If
the core is dazed or first bloodied, the wall is disabled for a turn.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I love this! It really stretches the mechanics of the game to give you an
encounter against an actual building who wants to kill you. The most likely
fight against the Wandering Tower will involve every stat block in this entry:
the Core itself on a building interior map with a number of Living Wall squares,
a mirror mimic servant, and the Blood Ravens ready to attack anyone who tries to
get out. That’s a very chaotic Level 20 Encounter for 5 characters, going into
the epic levels if your party is smaller.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>The fourth and final dragon described in this book.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Vestapalk is an adult green dragon who lairs in the Cairngorm Peaks. He’s very
typical of his demographic in that he’s an evil asshole whose favorite food is
the flesh of sapient mammals. Every time he kills an opponent he considers
worthy, he marks another scar on the inside of his right forearm to remember the
occasion. He currently has nine, most of which are ill-fated adventurers who
tried to loot his hoard.</p>

<p>Until recently, Vestapalk used to hunt in the Stonemarch region beyond the vale,
but he’s begun flying into the Vale more and more often, which has the
population of Winterhaven in a fright. One of the reasons for this is that the
dragon has started receiving prophetic visions in his dreams. These showed him
sitting proud as the overlord of a kobold tribe, and he decided to see if there
was any truth to them.</p>

<p>Most kobold tribes Vestapalk encountered ran scared from him, but one did
not. The Greenscale tribe was led by a wyrmpriest named Tiktag, who had been
receiving similar visions, and who welcomed Vestapalk as his awaited ruler. The
dragon’s support turned the Greenscales from just another embattled kobold tribe
to a local power that’s busy securing territory between Winterhaven and Lake
Wintermist.</p>

<p>Tiktag has great ambitions - he wants all others to fear him as his tribe fears
Vestapalk. I’m not sure he believes the dragon is a god, like his followers do,
but he does definitely think there’s something mystical about their partnership,
since Tiktag’s divination rituals have become amazingly accurate when done at
the dragon’s behest. The dragon, meanwhile, believes he might have been chosen
for greatness by the Elder Eye.</p>

<p>Though they would be loathe to admit it, the kobold and the dragon have come to
see each other as friends. They’re almost always together and Vestapalk even
allows Tiktag to ride on his shoulders for safety.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get stats for both Vestapalk and his tiny friend.</p>

<h3 id="tiktag">Tiktag</h3>

<p>The wyrmpriest is much more powerful than is typical, being a Level 6 Artillery
monster with 56 HP. As a kobold, he’s Small, has a Speed of 6, Low-Light Vision,
and the <strong>Shifty</strong> ability that lets him shift as a minor action.</p>

<p>Tiktag will always be found close to his dragon friend, and the <strong>Prophet of the
Elemental Eye</strong> trait gives him 5e-style Advantage on saves when he’s within 10
squares of Vestapalk. He’ll fire <strong>Poison Orbs</strong> that do poison damage from the
safety of his perch, and use his poison <strong>Dragon Breath</strong> (close blast 3) when
they happen to be close and bunched up. If an enemy moves adjacent to him he can
use <strong>Fierce Rebuke</strong> once per encounter to attack their Will. The enemy is
pushed 3 squares as an effect and either immobilized on a hit or slowed on a
miss. When that power is spent, the priest needs to resort to his <strong>spear</strong> to
discourage melee attackers.</p>

<p>Once per encounter he can use <strong>Incite Faith</strong> to give every kobold ally within
10 squares 5 temporary HP and allow them to shift 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="vestapalk">Vestapalk</h3>

<p>Our main event is a Large green dragon, and a Level 13 Solo Skirmisher with 524
HP. Most of his abilities are similar to the green dragon described in the
Monster Vault, but he’s the first Adult example you’re likely to see if that’s
the only other monster book you have (the MV has Young and Elder variants). He
has a speed of 10 with Forest Walk, and a flight speed of 14.</p>

<p>Like a typical green dragon, Vestapalk can use <strong>Action Recovery</strong> to shake off
the Dazed, Stunned, and Dominated conditions at the start of his turn, and the
poison in his veins works as a damaging aura when he’s bloodied. He can also use
an <strong>Instinctive Flyby</strong> at his Initiative count +10, flying his speed with a +4
bonus to defend against opportunity attacks and making a bite or claw attack
along the way. This is a free action - if a condition prevents him from using
free actions, that condition ends instead.</p>

<p>The dragon’s <strong>bite</strong> inflicts ongoing poison damage and his <strong>Claw</strong> attack
lets him shift 2 squares on a hit. His <strong>breath weapon</strong> (recharge 5+) deals
immediate and ongoing poison damage, halving both on a miss. He can use a
<strong>Luring Glare</strong> as a minor action to slide a target 3 squares, and has the
standard <strong>Bloodied Breath</strong> ability.</p>

<p>All of that is standard green dragon stuff. He also has two exclusive abilities:
<strong>Tail Sweep</strong> is a reaction that lets him attack any enemy who ended his turn
next to him without moving, dealing decent physical damage and knocking them
prone on a hit. And instead of an in-turn flyby attack, he can <strong>Share The Mad
Visions</strong> with every creature in a Close Burst 2, which deals psychic damage and
pushes targets a number of squares equal to their speed. This deals half damage
on a miss, and Vestapalk can shift his speed as an effect. This powerful ability
recharges when he’s bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>This sure is an odd pair. The level disparity means it’s a bit hard to fit them
both in an encounter. If you’re at the level where Tiktag would make a good
boss, Vestapalk is going to splat you. If you’re at a level where Vestapalk
makes a good boss fight, you’re going to splat Tiktag.</p>

<p>I would suggest either making them separate encounters at different times in the
PC’s career, or increasing Tiktag’s level. Note that Vestapalk would actually be
kind of reluctant to use Share the Mad Visions if the little kobold is around,
since that ability is not selective.</p>

<p>Vampiric Mists originally appeared back in AD&amp;D 1e, in Dungeon Magazine 17. This
is their 4e debut, with lore appropriate to the Nentir Vale.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Ancient legends tell that the Witchlight Fens mark the spot where a demon lord
was slain at the dawn of time - the region became a swamp when its corpse fell
there.</p>

<p>In slightly-less-ancient times, a lich whose name has been lost to history
established a lair in the Fens with the goal of finding the remains of this
demon lord and reanimating them as a super-powerful undead
creature. Accompanying the lich was a coven of nine vampire lords, its loyal
retainers. These vampires were tasked with hiding and guarding the lich’s soul
vessel.</p>

<p>Some time after that, one of the lich’s enemies, a powerful hag, came to the
fens in search of its soul vessel. She had created a custom ritual to destroy
the vampires, and she enacted it there, but it didn’t have the desired
effect. Her magic succeeded at destroying the bodies of the vampires, but their
essence remained and coalesced to form a new, more dangerous
creature. The hag left without finding the artifact, which remains in the Fens
protected by its gaseous guardian.</p>

<p>There’s a deserted clearing in the Fens that contains a single slab of stone in
its middle. That is the territory of the monster known as the Crimson Deathmist,
who endlessly roams it looking for new victims. It prefers the blood of elves
and other fey, but it will kill anyone it can reach. It has been a very long
time since anyone who encountered it has lived to tell the tale.</p>

<p>The stone slab conceals the entrance to a catacomb complex where the lich’s soul
vessel is hidden. The fate of the lich itself is unknown. Maybe it’s still in
the Fens somewhere, or maybe something peculiar happened to it to take it out of
the picture without destroying its vessel.</p>

<p>Not all vampiric mists have such an epic origin. A more common and less powerful
variety appears when a vampire who is forced into mist form has its resting
place destroyed before it can get there. To avoid permanent destruction, the
vampire will sometimes shed its physical form by an act of will, becoming a
vampiric mist. This causes it to lost most of its intellect and memories, and to
become a creature of hunger and instinct. They’re still smart enough to team up
with other evil or predatory swamp dwellers like hags, vine horrors, and outcast
lizardfolk. There’s always the danger the mist will turn on these allies if they
have blood and victims become scarce.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get several varieties of vampiric mist here, which I guess come from
different types of vampire, or vampires who met different ends. One of those is
the late-Paragon Crimson Deathmist, but others hover hungrily around the late
Heroic and early Paragon tiers.</p>

<p>All of them have Darkvision, immunity to disease, 10 Resistance to necrotic and
poison damage, and 5 vulnerability to radiant damage. Their ground speed is 0,
but their flight speed is a 5 with an altitude limit of 2. That means they never
land, but also can’t fly beyond melee reach.</p>

<p>All of these creatures have the <strong>Mist Form</strong> trait, which lets them move
through openings of any size and occupy the same space as other creatures. They
also count as <strong>Insubstantial</strong>, taking half damage from everything but fire,
force, or radiant damage. Fire or radiant damage additionally makes them lose
this trait for a turn.</p>

<p>Lesser mists have an aura (1) named <strong>Siphoning Presence</strong> that prevent enemies
inside from spending healing surges, and deal 5/tier necrotic damage to enemies
who end their turns inside. When the aura deals damage, the mist recovers 5
HP. Being inside the mist does count as being inside its aura. They are Medium.</p>

<h3 id="vampiric-mist">Vampiric Mist</h3>

<p>Our basic model is a Level 9 Skirmisher with 85 HP and all the standard traits
listed above. It can shift its speed as a move action using the <strong>Shifting
Mists</strong> ability, which ensures it will never move normally. Its basic attack is
a contact <strong>Life Drain</strong> that targets Fortitude, deals necrotic damage, and
makes the target vulnerable to necrotic damage for a turn. It can also spread a
<strong>Wave of Lethargy</strong> (recharge 5+) that attacks a Close Burst 2, deals a bit of
psychic and necrotic damage, and slows for a turn.</p>

<p>This thing is almost impossible to pin down. With multiple mists in the same
encounter, some can “prime” targets by hitting them with Life Drain to make them
take increased damage from a Wave of Lethargy.</p>

<h3 id="vampiric-mist-corruptor">Vampiric Mist Corruptor</h3>

<p>I guess this is what you get from a more traditional D&amp;D vampire who was capable
of using a dominating gaze and really leaned on this ability. Corruptors are
Level 11 Controllers with 100 HP and all standard traits described above.</p>

<p>As soon as the fight starts they’ll try to hit someone with their <strong>Corrupting
Gaze</strong>, which dominates (save ends) on a hit and deals necrotic and psychic
damage as an aftereffect. This recharges whenever the creature doesn’t have a
dominated victim!</p>

<p>After dominating a PC, it will attack the others with its <strong>bite</strong>, which deals
necrotic damage and slides 2 squares on a hit. Perfect for dragging other PCs
closer to the dominated one.</p>

<p>When the mist is first bloodied, it will let loose a <strong>Deathly Howl</strong> that hits
a Close Burst 5, pushes 3 squares on a hit and forbids targets from spending
healing surges (save ends).</p>

<p>Don’t add more than one or two of these to an encounter group. It’s no fun for
anyone if the whole party ends up dominated.</p>

<h3 id="chillborn-vampiric-mist">Chillborn Vampiric Mist</h3>

<p>This is a cold-themed mist. It’s a Level 9 Soldier with 85 HP and all standard
traits described above. All of its attacks do cold and necrotic damage. There’s
a <strong>bite</strong> that slows for a turn and the <strong>Grasp of the Cold Grave</strong> that
immobilizes for a turn.</p>

<p>These mists lack marking capabilities, but their attacks are still very good at
making movement difficult for PCs. It could easily be reskinned into some other
frost-themed ghost without any changes to its stats.</p>

<h3 id="crimson-deathmist">Crimson Deathmist</h3>

<p>The legendary Crimson Deathmist is a Huge entity, and a Level 19 Elite Soldier
with 328 HP. It’s faster with a flight speed of 6 and an altitude limit of 3. It
is however slightly more vulnerable to radiant damage (10 instead of 5).</p>

<p>This monster has all the standard traits, but its Siphoning Presence is renamed
to <strong>Impending Doom</strong> and upgraded. I has a radius of 2 instead of 1, and
restores 10 HP to the mist instead of 5.</p>

<p>The Deathmist can pull enemies 4 squares closer with its <strong>Hypnotic Lure</strong>
(at-will, minor action), and then <strong>Demand Obedience</strong> from them. This is a
melee attack that can target two creatures at the same time. It deals psychic
and necrotic damage, with an additional 10 damage the next turn if the targets
attack anyone other than the Deathmist.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>Deathly Grasp</strong> that deals necrotic and poison damage
and also slows for a turn. It can also release a <strong>Terror Wave</strong> that deals
psychic damage in a Close Burst 2 and immobilizes for a turn. That last one
recharges when it’s bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>The mists’ mechanics are cool, but what really drew my attention was the story
about the lich. A lich whose name is unknown, who lived in ancestral times, who
was interested in undead demon lords, and who is no longer around? That could be
Vecna, whose deeds in this place let him ascend. And instead of a typical soul
vessel you’d find his Eye at the bottom of this catacomb dungeon.</p>

<p>If that doesn’t appeal, you’ll notice that any party capable of defeating the
Crimson Deathmist guarding the entrance is at about the right level to tackle
the Tomb of Horrors… You’d need to change that clearing a bit to include the
three entrances, but otherwise it’s as good a place to put it as any.</p>

<p>D&amp;D Third Edition made many attempts to create new monsters that would grow
popular enough to become iconic, and I think these little critters were one of
their greatest successes even though they weren’t an intentional attempt.</p>

<p>They first appeared as custom opposition in The Sunless Citadel, the very first
official module for Third Edition. They had a very specific origin tied to the
overall story arc of that campaign. That origin is mentioned in version, but we
also see some lore that talks about them in the Vale.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Twig blights look like large woody shrubs or small trees with interlocking
branches. They can change shape somewhat to blend in with the surrounding
vegetation, and they can also uproot and twist themselves into roughly humanoid
shapes in order to hunt or migrate.</p>

<p>Blights need fresh blood to reproduce and grow, using their roots to absorb it
from the soil or directly from corpses. New seedlings sprout from their root
systems, as many as a dozen at a time. They’re very fragile early on, but mature
quickly and after a few days are big enough to start ambushing small creatures.</p>

<p>The first blights originated from the Gulthias Tree, which grew from the stake
used to slay ancient vampire who went by that name. Some people speculate that
repeating the process to create a similar tree could create new varieties of
twig blight, though of course few are unbalanced or evil enough to try.</p>

<p>Our Vale-specific story is about a lonely pig farmer named Fellis, who was the
first to discover these creatures in the Vale. A strange new bush appeared
overnight in his slaughter shed, and soon it began sprouting seedlings. Fellis
loved the little scamps, giving them names and playing them tunes on his
flute. His neighbors were very worried about all of this weirdness, but still
regularly went there to trade for pig meat.</p>

<p>During that winter, however, severe snow storms tore through the region and made
regular travel impossible until the thaw. When Fellis’ neighbors managed to get
to his farm again, they saw that the man, his family, his pigs, and even the cat
had all been killed. All that was left was a number of pulsating bushes
sprouting from their corpses. Several nearby villages banded together to burn
out the infestation, but a few individuals managed to escape into the
surrounding woods. So now we can add “twig blight infestation” to the list of
everyday disasters that can fall upon the people of the Vale.</p>

<p>Twig blights can survive from normal soil nutrients and sunlight like mundane
plants, but they vastly prefer to have access to a blood supply. Their numbers
increase rapidly when they can find a big source like a slaughterhouse or
battlefield, though even a single corpse is enough to let their reproduction
cycle continue. When their current blood supply runs dry, they’ll uproot
themselves to look for more. If can’t find a new victim or supply quickly,
they’ll take root again and wait in ambush.</p>

<p>Twig blights can even be found in dungeons, ruins, caves, and other places never
touched by the sun. Without access to light, they become even more bloodthirsty
than usual.</p>

<p>Some powerful creatures try to make use of twig blights as unguided boundary
guardians by seeding them along that boundary. However, the creatures are fickle
and as likely to follow the wind to nearby settlements as they are to stay in
place.</p>

<p>Twig Blights are monsters. They have some intelligence and can even speak Elven,
but they only use that to set up smarter ambushes. They only see other
creatures, sapient or not, as food sources, and only interact with them through
violence. You might be able to keep them contained for a while if you supply
them with enough blood, like Fellis did, but their reproductive cycle will
ensure their population quickly outstrips the supply, at which point they’ll
begin hunting for live prey (which means <em>you</em>).</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Twig Blights are Small Fey Humanoids with the Plant tag. They have ground and
climb Speeds of 5 with Forest Walk, and Darkvision. They have Resist Poison 5
and the non-minions have Vulnerable to Fire 5. Their signature trait is
<strong>Rooted</strong>, which reduces forced movement from pulls, pushes, or slides by 3
squares.</p>

<p>Like their original 3e incarnation, they’re early Heroic opposition.</p>

<h3 id="twig-blight-seedling">Twig Blight Seedling</h3>

<p>A seedling who just grew big enough to hunt. It’s a Level 1 Minion
Skirmisher. Their <strong>claw</strong> attack lets them shift 2 squares before making the
roll, deals poison damage, and has a small damage bonus when the target is
granting them combat advantage.</p>

<p>Their tactics are simple: surround and kill.</p>

<h3 id="twig-blight">Twig Blight</h3>

<p>The classic model is a Level 2 Lurker with 28 HP. It can turn <strong>invisible</strong> for
a turn with a standard action, and surprise opponents with <strong>Blighted Claw</strong>
attacks that do heavy poison damage and weaken (save ends). Even a miss still
does half damage and weakens for a turn.</p>

<p>If the blight can’t become invisible, it can still attack with basic <strong>claw</strong>
attacks that do a typical amount of poison damage.</p>

<h3 id="twig-blight-swampvine">Twig Blight Swampvine</h3>

<p>This is a new variant! It could be that classic blights adapted themselves to a
swampy environment… or it could be that someone out there did prove the
stake-tree theorem. They’re particularly common in the Witchlight Fens along the
Nentir River.</p>

<p>Swampvines are Level 3 Soldiers with 42 HP. They’ll use their minor actions to
pull targets close using a <strong>Swamp Vine</strong>, which also grabs them (escape DC
13). If a grabbed target attacks someone other than the swampvine, they take an
automatic 5 poison damage. They can also make basic <strong>claw</strong> attacks that do
poison damage.</p>

<h3 id="twig-blight-swarm">Twig Blight Swarm</h3>

<p>A big bunch of classic twig blights that decided to stop being subtle. It’s a
Large Swarm made up of Small creatures, and a Level 5 Brute with 74 HP. It’s
Swarm Attack aura deals 3 damage to those inside, and while it looses its
specific vulnerability to fire it’s still vulnerable to close and area attacks
like any other swarm.</p>

<p>Its version of <strong>Rooted</strong> makes it completely immune to being pushed, pulled, or
slid, and its <strong>Swarm of Claws</strong> basic attack deals poison damage.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’m sure there are lots of people who will be happy to have official 4e stats
for Twig Blights. Their explicitly unnatural origin and their monstrous
disposition tends to make them better “guilt-free” low-level opponents than your
usual selection of humanoids.</p>

<p>This incarnation of them is also quite tricky for low-level PCs to handle, since
a lot of their early powers rely on forced movement for their more interesting
effects.</p>

<p>Treants appear in the MM1 in a generic form. Here we see not one but two
specific treant factions present in the Vale.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Before the hillfolk, before the Tigerclaw, before even the elves, the Nentir
Vale was covered by a single, vast forest. And in this forest, the treants
ruled. They feared no one, not even the mighty dragons, for the entire region
was under the protection of Malorunth the Eternal Ash, a gigantic tree who as
also a powerful archfey.</p>

<p>One spring evening, however, Malorunth died under mysterious circumstances. The
once vigorous tree was now entirely petrified, leaves falling from its brittle
branches in droves. With Malorunth dead, its blessing left the Vale, and the
dragons who coveted it were quick to capitalize on the opportunity, arriving in
large numbers.</p>

<p>The battle that followed between treant and dragon was called the War of Endless
Branches, and it’s because of this war that the Nentir Vale looks like it does
today. Draconic magic and breath weapons cut a swathe of devastation across the
center of the region that created the large open area there, and separated
Winterbole Forest to the north from Harken Forest to the south.</p>

<p>The dragons would go on to win the war and move into the “cleared” area. They
were powerful, but what really brought them victory was the growing distrust and
suspicion among the treants themselves, which caused them to stop working
together and turn on each other.</p>

<p>You see, the deciduous treants began to think their coniferous relatives had
something to do with the death of Malorunth, and this suspicion festered enough
that they began voicing it aloud for everyone to hear. Arguments turned to
fights, and soon the treants were more concerned with their brand new civil war
than with keeping the dragons out.</p>

<p>This civil war caused the conifers to migrate north to Winterbole forest, where
they would eventually begin venerating the archfey of winter known as the Prince
of Frost. The deciduous treants stayed in Harken Forest, paying homage to the
petrified corpse of Malorunth, which still stands today. They believe the
Eternal Ash will be brought back to life if its murder can be avenged.</p>

<p>The war technically still rages, but it does so at a treant’s pace. There’s a
battle every century or two, when one of the group manages to organize a Great
March to attack the other’s territory. The fact that they must cross the entire
Vale to do so makes these marches even harder to organize, and slower to
happen. The last one was two hundred years ago, when Harken attacked
Winterbole. The next one will probably be a Winterbole attack, but sometimes it
happens that the same side will launch two attacks in a row.</p>

<p>Yes, the last battle in this war is older than the fall of Nerath, and there
probably are no surviving Nerathi records of it. Maybe there are a few very old
elves and eladrin who remember it. And maybe the Frost Witches or Harken’s Heart
druids might know, since they live in those forests. But almost no one else has
any idea that a new Great March might be in their future.</p>

<h2 id="winterbole-treants">Winterbole Treants</h2>

<figure class="center">

</figure>

<p>These conifer creatures consider fleshy humanoids to be annoying pests and
parasites, and try to keep their territory free of them. This is made more
difficult by the fact that their slice of Winterbole Forest has a lot of
Arkhosian ruins and Shadowfell crossings in it, so delvers and explorers often
seek those out.</p>

<p>They also have an alliance with Bitterstrike, whom we already met. The dragon
believes the treants to be her vassals, and they put up with this delusion as
long as she holds up her end of the bargain and assists them in the next Great
March.</p>

<p>Like all treants, they are Fey Magical Beasts with the Plant and Treant tags. In
addition to low-light vision, they have both Forest Walk and Ice Walk, ignoring
difficult terrain with either or both of these themes. Needless to say this type
of terrain is plentiful in their home ground. They also have Resist Cold 10 -
even the minion.</p>

<h3 id="winterbole-sapling">Winterbole Sapling</h3>

<p>These Medium saplings are energetic and aggressive, and often team up with
Winterbole-aligned Wood Woads in raids against the Tigerclaw and other
trespassers. They’re Level 11 Minion Soldiers with a Speed of 6. Their <strong>Slams</strong>
deal a bit of damage and immobilize for a turn, and their <strong>Numbing Branches</strong>
aura (1) deals 3 damage to immobilized enemies that start their turns inside.</p>

<p>This makes for enemies who likes to mob and surround a single target. If even
one of them hits, all of their auras will deal damage that round.</p>

<h3 id="winterbole-rimeneedle">Winterbole Rimeneedle</h3>

<p>Rimeneedles are the most intelligent of the “lesser” conifers, and tend to act
as scouts. They’re Large, and Level 12 Skirmishers with 122 HP. It has a Speed
of 8.</p>

<p>Rimeneedles are probably going to start the fight with <strong>Winter’s Step</strong>, a move
action encounter power that lets them teleport 5 squares and make a Close Burst
2 attack on arrival. This deals cold damage, half on a miss. It probably
involves forcefully ejecting those rime needles.</p>

<p>Since this is a move action, the treant can immediately follow it up with a
basic <strong>slam</strong> or with <strong>Tree Stomp</strong>, which lets it shift its speed and move
through enemy spaces while doing so. The rimeneedle can make one slam attack
against an enemy along this path, and will additionally knock the enemy prone if
it hits.</p>

<p>Fortunately as a non-minion treant, it has the <strong>Wooden Body</strong> weakness, which
causes it to ignite and take ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends) from any attack
that deals fire damage.</p>

<h3 id="winterbole-frostbeard">Winterbole Frostbeard</h3>

<p>The leaders of the Winterbole treants are the venerable Frostbeards, who can
command the winter. They’re rare and seldom seen by others, but they’re out
there.</p>

<p>Forstbeards are Level 16 Elite Controllers with the Leader tag and 308 HP. Their
size is Huge, their speed is 8, and they’re immune to being knocked prone. Their
<strong>Deep Roots</strong> reduce any forced movement inflicted on them by 2 (which can
negate the movement entirely), and when they spend their action point every ally
within 10 squares can make a free basic melee attack.</p>

<p>Their opening move is likely a <strong>Howling Blizzard</strong>, an encounter power that
deals heavy cold and thunder damage in an Area Burst 2 within 10 squares, and
knocks prone on a hit. The blizzard lingers as a zone that deals 10 cold damage
to people who end their turns inside. The frostbeard can move the zone up to 5
squares with a move action, and sustain it with a minor action.</p>

<p>Once the zone is in the battlefield, the frostbeard will likely wade inside it
and begin hitting people with <strong>Slams</strong>, which it can make as part of a <strong>Double
Attack</strong>. If things begin to look dicey, it can call upon the <strong>Spirits of the
Forest</strong> (move action, recharge 6+) to teleport itself and up to 3 nearby allies
up to 5 squares, granting them +2 to all defenses for a turn on arrival.</p>

<p>I guess their main weakness, aside from the usual Wooden Body, is that they have
three different things they can do with their move action: move the blizzard,
use Spirits of the Forest, or make normal moves. If they’re doing one of them,
they can’t do the others unless they give up their standard action. Therefore,
it’s possible to play “keep-away” with them to make them fight at less than
optimal strength. If you stay rooted to one spot, though, they’ll fight you with
slams while pulling the blizzard to sit on top of themselves.</p>

<h2 id="harken-treants">Harken Treants</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-treants-harken.png"/>
  <figcaption>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The deciduous treants of the Harken forest are quite standard as far as rules
go. They use the standard stat blocks for the Treant and Bramblewood Treant from
the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/01/06/treant.html">Monster Vault</a>. They do often work alongside wood woads, so we have a
couple of stat blocks for those in addition to the (by now slightly outdated)
basic stats from the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/03/08/wood-woad.html">Monster Manual 2</a>.</p>

<p>Their leader is the most exceptional thing about them: Mysteriphal is the oldest
living creature in the entire Vale. He was there when Malorunth fell, and swore
to forever protect his petrified husk. As mentioned above, Mysteriphal believes
Malorunth will return to life once his murder is avenged. In our narrative
present he’s a huge fire-and-curse scarred thing, any hints of his former
kindness and nobility long gone.</p>

<h3 id="wood-woad-druid">Wood Woad Druid</h3>

<p>I guess the existence of these guys explains why the Harken treants wouldn’t be
allied with the Harken’s Heart druids. They’re Level 14 Skirmishers with the
Leader tag and 145 HP.</p>

<p>The druid only has a speed of 5 and no Forest Walk, but it’s immune to the
Immobilized, Restrained, and Slowed conditions. It will likely try to approach a
squishy PC and use <strong>Polymorph Into Plant</strong> on them. This targets Fortitude, and
does what it says on the tin. It lasts for a turn or until the druid drops to 0
HP, whatever comes first. The polymorphed target is considered stunned, and
gains Vulnerable 15 to fire. This recharges whenever the druid misses with it,
so he can keep trying until it sticks.</p>

<p>If the polymorph attack doesn’t look like an attractive option, the druid can
hit people with his <strong>cudgel</strong>, using either basic attacks or a <strong>darting
strike</strong> that lets him shift 2 squares before or after the attack.</p>

<p>His leaderly options include <strong>Earthen Stride</strong> (at-will, move action), which
lets the druid and an adjacent ally shift 2 squares; and <strong>Nature’s Boon</strong>
(minor, encounter) which gives a plant ally 25 temporary HP.</p>

<h3 id="wood-woad-juggernaut">Wood Woad Juggernaut</h3>

<p>This Level 15 Brute is Large instead of Medium. He has 160 HP and fights mostly
with his powerful <strong>slams</strong>. He will charge if at all possible, since he has
Resist All 15 while charging.</p>

<p>Once his preferred opponent is within his melee reach of 2, the juggernaut will
try to tag them with <strong>Nature’s Reign</strong> (recharge 5+), a more damaging strike
that also inflicts ongoing 10 damage (save ends), and heals the juggernaut for
the same amount whenever the target takes this ongoing damage.</p>

<h3 id="mysteriphal">Mysteriphal</h3>

<p>The leader of the Harken treants is a Huge specimen, and a Level 20 Solo
Controller with 768 HP. This probably makes him the most powerful individual in
the whole Vale. Everything about him hints at his tremendous age, from his
scarred look to his stats. He ponderously drags himself at a speed of 4 without
Forest Walk, but is immune to poison since he has had time to build a tolerance
to all of them.</p>

<p>As an <strong>Ancient Entity</strong>, Mysteriphal automatically downgrades the Dominated and
Stunned conditions to Dazed. His long fighting experience gives him
<strong>Threatening Reach 3</strong>, but he’s even more flammable than a typical treant. He
takes ongoing 10 damage (save ends) when he takes fire damage, but while on fire
his melee attacks also deal an extra 10 fire damage.</p>

<p>Mysteriphal’s powerful Reach 3 <strong>slams</strong> damage and push the target 1 square,
and he can make <em>four</em> of them with a single standard action. If someone in
reach deals fire damage to him, he can make a free slam against the offender as
a reaction (which will already benefit from that bonus fire damage).</p>

<p>He also has several other tricks he can surprise his opponents with. Instead of
slamming he can use a <strong>Reverberating Word</strong> that attacks all nonplants in a
Close Burst 3, deals heavy thunder damage, and dazes for a turn. This is perfect
for use with an action point, since it lets him do <em>this</em> and still punch his
enemies. It also recharges when Mysteriphal is first bloodied, so that second
solo action point also has an easy pre-defined use.</p>

<p>As a minor action he can use a Reach 3 <strong>Root Grab</strong> to grab a target (DC 25)
and pull them up to 2 squares. He can have up to four different creatures
grabbed this way. This doesn’t deal damage… unless Mysteriphal is on fire,
when it benefits from the bonus. And if you think you’re safe by putting some
difficult terrain between Mysteriphal and yourself, the wily old treant can
<strong>Teleport</strong> 4 squares as a move action (recharge 4+) and reach you anyway.</p>

<p>PCs fighting Mysteriphal might want to consider <em>avoiding</em> fire attacks. While
they’re still effective, they also make him much more dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>This is a tragic story all around. Probably only the treants themselves remember
why they’re fighting, and barely anyone else would remember they’re fighting at
all due to the long quiet periods between Great Marches.</p>

<p>The truth about Malorunth’s death is a mystery literally older than mortal
civilization, making it almost impossible to solve. And even if our nearly-Epic
PCs manage it, it’s probably still not enough to get the treants to end their
war. It might have started over this murder mystery, but after millenia of
conflict both sides have plenty of reason to keep hating each other.</p>
