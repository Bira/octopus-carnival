        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Lately it seems “Let’s Read” threads of various D&amp;D books are becoming quite
popular over on RPG.net, so I though I would get in on the action, starting with
the first Monster Manual for Fourth Edition. And after thinking about it for a
while longer, I became convinced that you can’t discuss the first Monster Manual
anymore without also looking at the Monster Vault.</p>

<p>Fourth Edition is one of my favorite editions of D&amp;D<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, even though it doesn’t
get much love from the general public these days. So I’m going to write these
posts assuming that the reader doesn’t have a lot of familiarity with that
edition. This means we’ll start with a basic explanation of Fourth Edition’s
philosophy on monsters.</p>

<p>One of 4e’s design goals, particularly in its early days, was a focus on
gameable content. That means that every monster in the Monster Manual has to be
something you can potentially fight. As a result, there are no harmless “fantasy
wildlife” entries here, and almost no “always Good” monsters. In fact, some
creatures that used to be “Always Good” in previous editions have been made more
morally flexible, to increase the chance that Good-aligned adventurers might
come into conflict with one. Harmless or always-Good creatures still exist, of
course, but the thinking here is that if it’s not something you’re going to
fight, it doesn’t need a full stat block. This is one of the things that got
edition warriors in a tizzy, but I kinda liked it.</p>

<p>The space saved from this is used to present you with several different stat
blocks for each entry. There is no “generic kobold”, for example, but rather a
mix of them built for different purposes so that you can design all-kobold
encounters with interesting tactical situations. They’ll still all feel like
kobolds, though, because all of them are going to have a few “signature” traits
that are common to all kobolds.</p>

<p>This brings up another major “philosophical” difference between this edition and
others, in that you’re pretty much never expected to fight any given monster by
itself. The CR system from Third and Fifth kinda leads you to think that
way<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, but here it’s a little easier to keep in mind that an “encounter” is a
group of monsters with complementary abilities. Combat is a team sport!</p>

<p>Having said all that, I should point out a few bugs in the system that will be
particularly relevant for this Let’s Read. Fourth Edition’s monster design
system<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> was a little miscalibrated up until the release of the Monster
Manual 3. The main issue is that monster damage was too low, particularly for
high-level monsters. Elites and Solos also had defenses that were a bit too
high, which could extend combats past the point where they stopped being
fun. Since we’re reading the very first Monster Manual, every single monster is
going to have this problem, so I’m not going to mention it in each individual
entry.</p>

<p>That’s where the Monster Vault comes in. It was released a couple of years after
the first MM, as part of the D&amp;D Essentials line<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, and it basically updated
all the most popular monsters from the early books to the new
math. Presentation-wise, it featured improved stat-blocks that were easier to
read at a glance along with larger and better-organized lore entries for each
monster. The idea here was that if you were starting out with the Essentials
books, you could get the Vault and skip the older monster books, and if you
already had those you could buy the Vault as an update.</p>

<p>I’m going to read both of them in parallel! Whenever a monster features in both
books, I’ll compare them and talk about the differences. Otherwise, I’m just
going to discuss the monster as presented, but will kinda assume you’re going to
apply the necessary fixes if you use any MM-only monster.</p>

<p>By the way, this is a list of quick fixes you can make to bring early monsters
more or less in line with the “new monster math”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Add +1/2 level to all of their rolled damage (so a level 10 or 11 monster
would get +5 damage to all of its attacks).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add +2 to all attacks for Brutes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reduce all defenses for Elite and Solo monsters by 2.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first fix is courtesy of this <a href="http://blogofholding.com/?p=782">Blog of Holding post</a>, which also presents
another, unofficial fix proposed by players who still think the resulting
combats are too long: reduce base monster HP by 3 times the monster’s level. So
a level 10 regular would have 30 fewer HP, an elite 60 fewer, and a solo 120
fewer.</p>

<p>And that’s all for the introduction. Tune in next time for our first baddie, the
venerable Aboleth!</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/12/27/channel-divinity.html">New-School Turn Undead</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Turn Undead was <em>the</em> iconic ability of old-school D&amp;D clerics, moreso than
spellcasting. They could do it at will right from level one. It started fairly
effective at turning skeletons and rapidly grew in effectiveness, affecting more
powerful types of undead and eventually destroying the less powerful ones
instead of just making them run away.</p>

<p>In Dungeon Fantasy, True Faith with Turning shares most of these traits. It
doesn’t let you destroy undead, but it still makes it a lot easier for the rest
of the party to finish the job. Particularly if they have ranged or high-Reach
melee weapons!</p>

<p>After several editions of evolutionary pressure, D&amp;D Turn Undead became quite
different. In most “modern” editions it was renamed to something like “Channel
Divinity” or “Channel Positive Energy”. It could only be used a few times a day
and had several possible effects. When used for its original purpose, it caused
damage to undead instead of turning them. The effectively turned it into a
secondary ability, taking a backseat to spellcasting.</p>

<p>This “new-school” form of Turn Undead might look something like this in Dungeon
Fantasy:</p>

<h2 id="channel-divinity-182736-points">Channel Divinity (18/27/36 points)</h2>

<p><em>Pre-requisite</em>: Power Investiture (Holy) or Holy Might 1+.</p>

<p>You channel the powers of your deity into a blast of glorious light that
emanates from your body and causes terrible burn to evil undead caught in its
radius!</p>

<p>Using this ability requires a Concentrate maneuver and costs 2 FP. It affects
any foes who would also be vulnerable to standard Turning, out to a distance of
4 meters/yards from you. Roll a Quick Contest of Will with each such target. You
have a bonus to this contest equal to your Power Investiture (plus +1 or +2 for
an exceptional holy symbol) and a penalty equal to the distance between you and
the enemy in meters/yards. A monster’s Resistance to Good applies a bonus to its
Will. Any foe who loses this contest takes 2d, 3d or 4d of burning damage
(depending on the level of this ability). This damage bypasses all DR and
affects insubstantial undead!</p>

<p><em>Statistics</em>: This is Burning Attack 2d, 3d or 4d with the following modifiers:
Area Effect, 4m, +100%; Affects Insubstantial +20%; Malediction 1, +50%;
Affects only Truly Evil Undead, -50%; Costs Fatigue, 2FP, -10%; Emanation, -20%;
PM: Holy -10%.</p>

<h2 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h2>

<p>This power is basically just an area version of the Smite ability from <strong>Monster
Hunters</strong>. The Accessibility limitation that restricts the target it affects is
a <em>little</em> different, but I gave it the same value because it doesn’t change the
size of the affected group all that much.</p>

<p>It makes clerics a lot more dangerous against undead in close combat, and gives
Holy Warriors a good area attack option against such foes. Taking this instead
of traditional Turning sacrifices some tactical flexibility in exchange for
increased damage potential. It suits firebrand clerics of sun deities and the
like. Of course, there’s nothing preventing a suffciently powerful character
from eventually acquiring both!</p>

<p>Channel Divinity does <em>not</em> make [Smite Evil][1] redundant, since the valid
targets for both abilities are slightly different. Smite Evil could affect
demons, for example, but would do nothing against mindless undead. It can’t be
combined with Smite Evil.</p>

<p>Almost all of the classic Paladin abilities from D&amp;D have a clear analogue in
the list of powers available to Holy Warriors in either version of Dungeon
Fantasy.</p>

<p>With one exception.</p>

<h2 id="smite-evil-5-pointslevel">Smite Evil (5 points/level)</h2>

<p><em>Pre-Requisite</em>: Holy Might or Power Investiture (Holy) 1+.</p>

<p>You can empower your blows with the very wrath of the heavens! Channeling raw
Holy Might in this way can be tiring, but it can also be just the thing to bring
down a powerful servant of Evil.</p>

<p>You can buy as many levels in Smite Evil as you have levels in Holy Might. You
can declare you’re using it before you attack an enemy with your fists or with a
weapon. For each FP you pay (up to your level in this ability) your attack will
cause an extra 1d of follow-up burning damage to the enemy if it hits!</p>

<p>This damage is effective against insubstantial targets, even if your normal
weapon attacks aren’t. On the other hand, it only affects Truly Evil
foes. Smiting anyone else just wastes the FP, but at least you’ll know
immediately why it didn’t work. Detect Evil is a very useful companion to this
ability!</p>

<p><strong>Statistics</strong> Each level is Burning Attack 1d (Follow-Up, Universal +50%;
Affects Insubstantial +20%; Variable +5%; Only against Truly Evil targets -50%,
Costs Fatigue, Variable, 1 FP/die, -15%, PM: Holy, -10%) {5}.</p>

<h2 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h2>

<p>Smite Evil is the most popular ability of D&amp;D Paladins. It’s present in all
editions of the game, though its implementation differs substantially from one
to the other.</p>

<p>The ability as presented above is somewhere between the 3.5 and Fifth Edition
versions. Like the one in 3.5, it enhances a single attack and its use is a
waste if the target is not evil or if the attack misses. Like the one in 5th
edition, its use is limited by the same resource you would use to cast
spells. As a Holy Warrior, you have to put some thought on when you use Smite
Evil, but the cost of a missed attack can be recovered with a few minutes’ rest.</p>

<p>The “Only against Truly Evil targets” limitation is inspired by a similar
limitation in the Smite power found on <strong>GURPS Monster Hunters 1:
Champions</strong>. It includes a bunch of undead and demons, as well as a few other
monsters, but also <em>excludes</em> a lot of common opponents, so I feel that’s a fair
value. Damage from Smite Evil counts as holy, so if you have a Truly Evil
monster who is also extra-vulnerable to holy attacks, this will make them dead
very fast.</p>

<p>The variable fatigue cost limitation was calculated according to the guidelines
in <strong>GURPS Power-Ups 8: Limitations</strong>, and Universal Follow-Up is from its
sister volume on <strong>Enhancements</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want your holy warriors to smite evil at will, removing the variable FP
cost would bring the ability’s cost to something like 6 points/level and make it
a lot more devastating against evil monsters, particularly at higher
levels. Allowing it to affect <em>anyone</em> would make it cost around 8 points/level,
but would potentially step on the Knight’s toes. Doing both would bring the cost
up to around 9 points/level.</p>

<h3 id="alternate-smites">Alternate Smites</h3>

<p>Higher Purpose works as a lower-intensity at-will smite in the vein of
some D&amp;D 4 powers, since it gives bonuses to attack and damage against demons
and/or undead. Heroic Feats is a bit like Pathfinder’s version, giving you
bonuses for a limited amount of time instead of affecting one attack.</p>

<p>By the way, the Smite power from <strong>Monster Hunters</strong> would itself be a nice Holy
Might power for those characters who rely more on their strenght of will than on
their muscles. In Dungeon Fantasy it would cost 10 points/level and be similarly
limited by your level of Holy Might or Power investiture, and only affect Truly
Evil monsters.</p>

<p>All of these abilities can coexist peacefully in the same campaign, or even in
the same character with enough points. Smite Evil stacks with both Higher
Purpose and Heroic Feats, but <em>not</em> with Smite from Monster Hunters due to the
way Universal Follow-Up works.</p>

<p>Back when I <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics/">statted up the Pathfinder Iconics for both versions of Dungeon
Fantasy</a>, I decided to work under a set of restrictions to make those
characters more “by the book”. The idea was that anyone who had either GURPS DF
or the DFRPG boxed set could pick the appropriate version and start playing.</p>

<p>Were I making those characters solely for my own use, however, I would have done
a few things differently. Like everyone else, I have a particular “house style”
shaped by my personal preferences. And like everyone else who owns both versions
of DF, I have a particular way of picking which version of the rules to use for
any given situation.</p>

<p>I plan to discuss those preferences in this article, for a simple reason: I want
to post more characters in this blog, and I want to make them according to my
own preferences. It’s useful for the reader to understand what those are!</p>

<h2 id="character-templates">Character Templates</h2>

<p>Any professional template from the main GURPS Dungeon Fantasy line or the DFRPG
box set are allowed. Pick whatever version you like best! You can also use any
templates published in Octopus Carnival. Templates from other sources are
subject to my review on a case by case basis, provided I have access to the
source in question.</p>

<p>The same goes for racial templates. In fitting with my stated policy on <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2018/10/18/peoples-of-tamriel.html">this
post</a>, however, I consider attribute adjustments and traits with a “cultural”
origin to be mere suggestions and not part of the template. If you want your
dwarf to be a hard-headed greedy grump, take those as individual disadvantages.</p>

<h2 id="traits-and-powers">Traits and Powers</h2>

<p><em>Most</em> traits and powers that exist in both versions of Dungeon Fantasy are
identical in both, but when that’s not the case I generally go with the cooler
or cheaper version. “Resistant to X” is the one that comes to mind here. I
prefer the DFRPG version because it’s slightly cheaper and more granular than
the default GURPS one.</p>

<p>If a power only exists in one version of the game, you’re obviously still
allowed to get it no matter where you took your template from. DFRPG bards can
learn Alarum, and DFRPG druids can have animal companions.</p>

<h2 id="spells">Spells</h2>

<p>I’ll be honest, my mastery of the GURPS Magic system leaves something to be
desired when compared to my knowledge of its other rules. I’m a fan of fighters,
what can I say? For this reason, DFRPG: Spells is the baseline magic book for
any campaign of mine. The spells in there are already pre-selected and
pre-edited for a Dungeon Fantasy campaign. Spells not present in that book will
be allowed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>The “canonical” weapons list for my campaigns is the one from Low-Tech, though
the one in DFRPG: Adventurers will do as a substitute in a pinch. As far as I
know, it just has less weapons. Weapon modifiers are the ones in DFRPG:
Adventurers. The “canonical” armor list is the one from DFRPG: Adventurers. The
Basic Set one feels outdated, and Low-Tech’s hit location rules are too complex
for me.</p>

<p>I haven’t had to deal with characters of wildly differing sizes yet, but I’m
tempted to use the scaling rules in vanilla DF when that happens. Just for
<em>armor</em>, though. For weapons, just pick an appropriate stat line for a smaller
weapon and wield it with the skill that feels right. For example, a pixie knight
might wield various knives with Broadsword, Two-Handed Sword or Polearm
depending on size.</p>

<p>Other gear should <em>generally</em> be taken from the DFRPG list, though I gather it’s
similar enough to most GURPS sources that you can take something from Low-Tech
or the Basic Set if you really want it.</p>

<p>The Tech Level is 4, when that matters. The availability of guns is decided on a
per-campaign basis.</p>

<h2 id="side-note-iconics-in-the-house-style">Side Note: Iconics in the House Style</h2>

<p>If I were to stat up the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics/">Pathfinder Iconics</a> in my “house” style, they’d
mostly follow the DFRPG templates, but freely borrow from the GURPS DF line for
powers. Kyra would get her fire spells, Lem would get his bard song, Lini her
pet leopard, Sajan his kopesh, and even Valeros his Dual-Weapon Attack. I guess
the exceptions would be Amiri and Merisiel, as I find their DFRPG selves
all-around better than the original.</p>

<p>I’m not going back and statting these bozos up a <em>third</em> time, though. I leave
that as an exercise for the reader.</p>

            <p>There’s this William Gibson short story, from way back at the beginning of his
career, called “The Gernsback Continuum”. You could argue it’s a neat
encapsulation of everything the cyberpunk literary movement was all about.</p>

<p>It’s about a photographer who gets hired to travel through the US and take
pictures for an art book, of buildings built using this very specific sort of
40’s-50’s architecture. You know the one: aerodynamic fins and flanges
everywhere, meant to look “futuristic” in a robots-and-spaceships kind of
way. Of course, the story takes place in the 80s so everyone there knows the
future these buildings were alluding to never came to pass. That’s what the art
book is going to be about, that nostalgic lost future feeling.</p>

<p>Our protagonist gets so into it that he starts hallucinating that future. Silver
teardrop-shaped cars driving on the highway or flying in the sky above it. A
plane that’s a huge flying wing with twelve propeller engines, two squash courts
and a ballroom.</p>

<p>It culminates in an entire city (Tucson, IIRC) visible on the horizon being
replaced by a version of itself that’s all impossibly tall flanged towers linked
by crystal roads and swarming with those silver cars and with Beautiful People
in Togas. There’s a couple of them right beside our protagonist, though they
don’t see him. They talk to each other with sweeping gestures and bold
statements that can be summarized as “Isn’t the future great? And it’s all
ours!”</p>

<p>At that precise moment, our protagonist freaks the fuck out. I was a dumb
teenager when I first read this story, so I didn’t quite get what was so
horrible about that moment. Now I do. Every one of those Beautiful People in
Togas is white, blond and blue-eyed. <em>What the heck did they do to everyone
else?</em> Perhaps that lost future never coming to pass isn’t a bad thing at
all<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. In the end the protagonist gets rid of the hallucinations through a
steady diet of crappy media and headline news about the oil crisis.</p>

<p>The story’s title refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>, the man responsible for editing
the science fiction magazine <em>Amazing Stories</em> from 1926 to 1936. I’m guessing
everything our poor photographer sees comes from that magazine, too, or from
other publications influenced by its style stretching into the 50s. Gernsback
also lends his name to the Hugos, one of the two top literary prizes in the
field of SF.</p>

<p>The cyberpunk movement, whose writers would end up winning quite a few Hugos
themselves, was in large part a reaction to this style of science fiction. As
the introduction to Guardians of Order’s <em>Ex Machina</em> so aptly puts it,
cyberpunk stories were about outsiders trying to survive and find happiness in
the face of an oppressive society. Cyberpunk protagonists, Gibson’s in
particular, were often criminals, drug addicts, poor, kids, people of color, or
more than one of the above at the same time.</p>

<p>The worlds of classic literary cyberpunk had all sorts of social problems that
were directly inspired by the present in which those stories had been
written. They weren’t exactly extrapolations, but rather commentary on the
present. Since the stories were set in the future, I think they also ended up
presenting us with another message: those issues don’t just go away because
technology advances. If you ignore them today, they’ll still haunt you tomorrow.</p>

<p>By now I’ve read a bunch of online discussions where people say the cyberpunk
genre is dated or outright obsolete. We’re no longer in the Eighties. Things
have changed. The tech looks either retro or absurd to our modern eyes, the USSR
imploded, Japanese companies didn’t take over the world.</p>

<p>I feel this argument is kinda missing the point. The specific technologies and
setting elements that appear in classic cyberpunk stories are indeed a product
of their time, but they’re just props. The themes and motifs behind those props
are timeless. It’s quite possible to write a story with more up-to-date props
that still feels cyberpunk. Heck, Gibson himself never stopped doing exactly
that.</p>

<p>Overly focusing on the props is a mistake a I feel a lot of people
make. These people include a good number of RPG writers and fans,
unfortunately. I clearly remember reading an article that talked about just such
a thing once, but unfortunately I can’t remember where. So when I next talk
about this, I’m going to be writing my own version of that article.</p>
