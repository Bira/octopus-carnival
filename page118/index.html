<p><strong>Hall of Judgment</strong> is a particularly notable adventure for the <strong>Dungeon
Fantasy RPG</strong>, because it’s published not by Steve Jackson Games but by Gaming
Ballistic LLC. It’s not only the first licensed DFRPG book, it’s also the first
licensed GURPS book I’ve ever heard of.</p>

<p>It was published fairly recently as of this writing, after a successful
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2101297466/hall-of-judgment-a-dungeon-fantasy-rpg-supplement">kickstarter campaign</a>. I backed it pretty early on, and now I have a copy of
the final <strong>Hall of Judgment</strong> PDF in my screen. So let’s review it!</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

<p>If you already have the DFRPG boxed set and are looking for supplements to add
to your game, this should be at the very top of your shopping list. It contains
a Viking-flavored mini-setting with plenty of cultural notes; four separate
dungeons; a set of rules for wilderness travel; the GURPS version of the Dungeon
Grappling rules; approximately 30 new monsters; and 16 setting-appropriate
pre-made player characters.</p>

<p>If you also have the Dragon Heresy intro set and wanted to play in that setting
using GURPS rules, then this book should get you most of the way there.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-book-itself">On the Book Itself</h2>

<p><strong>Hall of Judgment</strong> is a 132-page book describing all of the stuff I mentioned
in the TL; DR section. I backed this at the PDF level, so this is what I
have. The physical book will be softcover and produced via Print-on-Demand - it
seems the campaign didn’t quite reach the stretch goal for fancier printing
options.</p>

<p>The layout is a bit similar to that of the Dragon Heresy intro-set, but it feels
“GURPSier”, as it should. The font is a bit different, the columns are closer
together and the ornamentation around the edges of the pages is different. It
all still feels pretty Vigking-ish. <strong>Hall of Judgement</strong> also reuses several
pieces of art from the DH intro set, which is fine by me as they also fit well
here.</p>

<p>The writing is reminiscent of plenty of other Dungeon Fantasy products, a style
I personally like. The setting descriptions are written in a way that makes it
more amenable to a full reading than quick reference, but the dungeons have a
clearly labeled section for each room, with labeled paragraphs describing the
challenges, rewards, alternative ways of dealing with the challenges, and
anything that might be initially concealed from the PCs. I’m sure the Ten Foot
Pole guy would think they’re still a little too verbose, though.</p>

<p>Along with the PDF I also got two zip files containing full-sized versions of
the encounter and dungeon maps present in the book. The encounter maps have no
grid, which means they’re suitable for use in a virtual table-top program.</p>

<p>And once again, this book has a table of contents and index comparable to those
of a GURPS book, which is awesome.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-setting">On the Setting</h2>

<p>The mini-setting contained in this book consists of the city of Isfjall and its
surrounding region, which includes Lake Odin, a few other
named-but-not-described villages, and a large and dangerous wilderness
containing four separate dungeons. One of those is the titular Hall.</p>

<p>This is a <em>significant</em> expansion over this adventure’s initial incarnation as
<em>Lost Hall of Tyr</em> for D&amp;D 5th Edition, which from what I gather started with
the PCs arriving near the Hall already. The whole setting is really a slice of
Torengar, the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2018/06/18/dragon-heresy-review.html">Dragon Heresy</a> world, but in the KS campaign’s words it has
been “mildly de-Norsed” so as to be dropped into any Dungeon Fantasy campaign as
the generic “Frozen North” from which barbarian characters frequently hail.</p>

<p>Isfjall is described in great detail for a Dungeon Fantasy work, in which “Town”
is usually entirely abstract. You get a rundown of the town’s economy, a little
primer on local culture, social hiearchies, religion and law, and a list of
almost-weekly festivals covering the whole year. Reading this you get a real
sense of why people built a town <em>here</em>, where the money and food comes from,
and what their daily lives are like. You can set your adventure at any given day
in a year and know what the town will look like on that day, from the
information given here.</p>

<p>This plus a table of rumors and the hook for the main dungeon take up a little
under 20 pages.</p>

<p>I liked this section quite a lot. It’s a nice departure from the “village of
dirt farmers plagued by mysterious disappearances” that features in so many
D&amp;D-ish modules, and it’s easy enough to modify. You can add the serial numbers
back on by replacing a few names, if you want to play in Torengar or stop
pretending the local pantheon aren’t the Aesir. You can also take it in the
other direction and, say, turn this into the basis for a Skyrim adaptation.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-adventure">On the Adventure</h2>

<p>Right after the chapter on Isfjall is a chapter on “The Journey”, which has a
neat little set of wilderness travel rules. They won’t be news to people who
already own GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 16, but they’re an awesome addition for anyone
who only owns the boxed set. Each of the three sub-regions the PCs will need to
traverse to reach the Hall are given their own encounter table, which contains a
good mix of natural obstacles and non-hostile encounters in addition to hostile
monsters. There is also a weather table covering the whole year. If you want to
really challenge your party, have them set out to find the Hall in the middle of
winter.</p>

<p>All this wilderness traveling can lead to one of four different
dungeons. There’s a ruined fortress built atop a barrow that contains the
spirits of all its inhabitants, two different fae lairs and the Hall of Judgment
itself. At no point are your players forced to go to any of them - there’s a
strong hook pointing them towards the Hall, but the adventure doesn’t impose any
punishment on the PCs if they want to do something else first, or instead. There
are also other minor hook suggestions here for GMs who want to make up their own
adventures in the setting.</p>

<p>The ruined fortress and the Hall of Judgment feel suitably Nordic, and the PCs
are likely to visit the first in their search for the second. The two faerie
warrens are entirely optional deathraps that should be a blast to GM.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-new-material">On the New Material</h2>

<p>Aside from the town setting and dungeons, this book contains plenty of new
material that should be useful for other campaigns. I already mentioned the
wilderness travel rules - the generic portion of them takes up about two pages,
and the specific portion provides a good worked example of how to stat up a
region’s weather.</p>

<p>Then you have Fantastic Dungeon Grappling, which is basically the GURPS version
of Dungeon Grappling rules Mr. Cole wrote for several editions of D&amp;D, which in
turn are a simplified version of the Technical Grappling rules he originally
wrote as a GURPS. I posted <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2018/04/06/quick-and-dirty-technical-grappling.html">my own take</a> on a simplified Technical Grappling
a few months ago, but the rules from this book are better and I recommend using
them if you can. I’ve already used them to great effect in a game I’m GMing.</p>

<p>If grappling rules don’t ring your bell, the 30+ new monsters statted up here
should make up for that. Each gets a page, with description, DFRPG stats, and an
illustration. All of them show up somewhere in the adventure, though your PCs
aren’t expected to fight every last one. You get a mix of wild and domestic
animals, some humans, a few undead and demons, and a whole lot of faeries from
Norse mythology. Even the weakest of <em>those</em> are quite a bit scarier than you’d
expect from their appearance.</p>

<p>After the bestiary there’s a group of 16 ready-to-play PCs, most of which are
local to the region. Since the adventure is written for a group of 4 to 6, this
is more than enough to assemble a number of possible parties, which would make
this adventure a lot easier to pick up and play provided the GM knows the book.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I got this book by backing the Kickstarter campaign at the US$10 tier. It’s now
available on <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/products/dungeon-fantasy-hall-of-judgment">Warehouse 23</a> or <a href="https://gamingballistic.com/product/hall-of-judgment-dfrpg-pdf/">Gaming Ballistic</a> for US$12.50. In its 132
pages it contains an adventure, a setting, new rules, a bestiary and a pre-made
PC portfolio. Given that your typical Dungeon Fantasy supplement only does one
of these things, costs $8, and likely contains some of the same material that
was put into the DFRPG boxed set, this book should probably be at the top of
your shopping list if all you have is that boxed set.</p>

<p>Even if you’re a GURPS Dungeon Fantasy player, this is still excellent value for
the money, as the only redundant bit here would be the 2 pages of wilderness
travel rules, and that only if you already have DF 16.</p>

<p>The theme for this month in the secretive cabal of GURPS bloggers is “fire or
heat”, so I figured I would do something a bit different from my usual
dungeonnesque fare and adapt Melta weapons from Warhammer 40K to GURPS.</p>

<p>Hasn’t that been done already? Yep! Many times, often for the whole of 40K
rather than just one weapon, with results of varying quality. A quick search for
“gurps meltagun” brings in this <a href="http://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?t=67296">this thread in the SJ Games forums</a> as the
top result, and there are a whole lotta others below that. My only excuse for
doing this is the Full Metal Jacket adage: “There are many like it, but this one
is mine.”</p>

<h2 id="meltaguns">Meltaguns</h2>

<p>These bulky weapons fire short-ranged beams of concentrated heat with an effect
similar to the blast of a shaped charge. They use canisters of highly compressed
exotic gasses as ammo, which account for about a third of their considerable
weight. There is pretty much no reason to use one of these instead of a good
anti-vehicle missile, but the Imperium of Man never cared for reason.</p>

<p>A meltagun can punch through most personal and vehicular armor and cause
grievous harm to the soft bits behind it. If you miss, though, your target will
be in a prime position to shoot back or charge at you<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Melta weapons come in several varieties:</p>

<p><strong>Inferno Pistols</strong> can (barely) be fired with one hand, using Beam Weapons
(Pistol). Their effective range is a bit shorter than that of your typical video
game shotgun, which is quite a feat.</p>

<p>Standard <strong>Meltaguns</strong> are fired using Beam Weapons (Rifle). They do the same
damage as inferno pistols, but have greater range and more shots per
canister.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-meltas</strong>, as the name implies, basically consist of several meltagun
assemblies bolted together. The resulting weapon is huge and heavy, with a heat
so intense it produces a 3d burn “backblast” that affects the shooter
and anyone standing up to 2 meters behind them. For these reasons it’s usually
either carried by large people in powered armor, mounted on vehicles, or
attached to shielded tripods. In the first case it’s fired with Beam Weapons
(Rifle); in the others with Gunner (Beams).</p>

<p>All melta weapons halve their armor divisor past 1/2D, and are affected by
spaced, laminated or electromagnetic armor as if they were shaped charges.</p>

<h2 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h2>

<p>Like Perfect Organism did over on <a href="http://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?t=67296">his forum thread</a>, I started by looking
through Ultra-Tech in search of already existing weapons that would be similar
to Warhammer 40K’s melta weapons. The plasma flamers on page 127 of that book
looked almost promising, but look both too weak and too slim to fit the bill.
The root of the problem is GURPS Ultra-Tech assumes a universe that makes sense,
even when describing superscience. But this is Warhammer 40K! Nothing makes
sense!</p>

<p>So in the end I took inspiration both from the plasma flamer stats in Ultra-Tech
and from the melta weapon stats in the Only War corebook. Then I pulled the
final numbers of out the Warp. The end result is even more insane and less
realistic than UT’s plasma flamers, but that’s what the superscience tag is for.</p>

<p><em>Pricing</em> these monstrosities is left as an exercise for the reader. If you’re
playing in the 40K setting or somewhere similar, cost doesn’t really matter,
since the people most likely to use these weapons will have them issued by their
bosses. In other settings they’re perfect as the inventions of a pyromaniac
mad scientist or the like. If they are available commercially, they should be
expensive, and in all of these cases their Legality Class is no better than 1.</p>

<p>This is another entry in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">Dragon’s Dogma bestiary</a>. So, uh, it’s been a
while since I posted one of these hasn’t it? The reason for that is
twofold. First, we’re getting into the final stretch of the game’s main plot
here, and I confess I haven’t played it much past that point.</p>

<p>Second is that the only monsters really left to cover are dragons, and dragons
are kinda hard to stat not only because I feel I have to get them right, but
because the Dungeon Fantasy RPG already did such a good job of it that almost
anything I tried to do would only end up looking like a straight copy from
it. Here is my attempt to do something different.</p>

<h2 id="lesser-dragons">Lesser Dragons</h2>

<p>The path of the Arisen is a long and grueling one, and one of the most shocking
revelations many of them face while walking it is that <em>The</em> Dragon is not the
only such beast. There are others, smaller in size but still quite large and
deadly.</p>

<p>Most people of Gransys ignore the existence of lesser dragons. Not even those
who make it their business to study the cycle know much about them. The secret
of their origin might only be learned from the dragons themselves, or from an
ancient Arisen who survived past encounters with them: every lesser dragon was
once an Arisen. One who was defeated by <em>The</em> Dragon, and as a result was
reincarnated in a draconic body to be sent into the world during further
incursions.</p>

<p>Lesser dragons have the same general body plan as their larger “cousin”. They
fight with their natural weapons (teeth, claws, tail, elemental breath) but
might also have access to some of the powers they posessed in their past
lives. A lesser dragon’s recollection of that life varies from individual to
individual, but all feel a compulsion to test the might of the Arisen in deadly
combat. How they deal with that also varies from individual to individual.</p>

<p>All such creatures are sapient and capable of speech, though only the Arisen and
the Pawns can understand their language.</p>

<p>If you have access to <strong>DFRPG: Monsters</strong>, the stats for SM+3 dragons contained
there are perfectly adequate for representing Dragon’s Dogma lesser
dragons. The stats for western dragons found in <strong>GURPS Dragons</strong> also work
nicely.</p>

<p>If you can’t or don’t want to use those, keep reading!</p>

<h2 id="build-a-dragon">Build-A-Dragon</h2>

<p>Rather than giving you a “canonical” lesser dragon stat block, I’m going to give
you a basic, generic template and instructions on how to customize it. This
reinforces the notion that every lesser dragon is a unique individual.</p>

<h3 id="customizing-your-dragon">Customizing your dragon</h3>

<p>To get a final stat block for your dragon, you’re going to have to decide who
they were in life. Choose the DFRPG professional template that most closely
matches the original person’s capabilities, and quickly select what advantages
and disadvantages that person had. Let’s call that the original
character. Combine it with the dragon stats above in the following way:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ST</strong>: For every point ST the original character has over 10, add 2 to the
dragon’s ST.</li>
  <li><strong>DX</strong>, <strong>IQ</strong>, <strong>HT</strong>: For every point over 10 the character template has in
these attributes, add 1 to the dragon’s corresponding attribute.</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary Characteristics</strong>: Figure the new totals from the dragon’s final
primary attributes, plus any modifying traits from the original
character. <em>Double</em> any levels of Lifting ST, Striking ST or extra HP - all
other such traits apply at the same level.</li>
  <li><strong>Other Advantages and Disadvanatages</strong>: These all transfer directly to the
dragon where applicable, and are modified to apply to the dragon’s natural DR
or weapons where it makes sense. Points spent in things like Armor or Shield
Mastery would convert into increased DR or defenses for the dragon, and a
former Weapon Master might be considered Trained by a Master when fighting
with its natural weapons.</li>
  <li><strong>Skills</strong>: The dragon has a Brawling skill equal to the original character’s
highest melee combat skill, or DX+2, whichever is highest. It also has an
Innate Attack skill equal to the original character’s highest ranged combat
skill or DX+2, whichever is highest. Points spent on Acrobatics or other such
movement skills would transfer to Flight and Aerobatics instead. All other
skills transfer directly.</li>
  <li><strong>Magic</strong>: Magery, spells and any other magic powers transfer directly!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want tougher dragons, the easiest way to get them is to start with a more
powerful original character. You can also increase the dragon’s base DR to a
level you find appropriate before performing the rest of the operations above.</p>

<h2 id="example-dragons">Example Dragons</h2>

<p>These are the three lesser dragons you can find in the original game.</p>

<h3 id="the-drake">The Drake</h3>

<p>This dragon was once a dutiful knight that protected his liege with sword and
shield. Now he feels compelled to test the current Arisen’s resolve to face the
challenges he himself could not.</p>

<p>The Drake prefers to stay on the ground and engage his opponents in melee
combat, making use of Rapid Strikes and Deceptive Attacks. Enemies who try to
keep their distance get hit with his fiery breath weapon, or dominated if
they’re Pawns. All the while, he taunts them and questions their worth.</p>

<p>The Drake will not pursue foes who choose to flee and escape its chosen
territory, unless the Arisen is among them. In that case, or if its opponents
stand their ground, he will fight to the death.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 32; <strong>DX</strong> 16; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 16.</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 32; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 16.</p>

<p><strong>Speed</strong> 8.50; <strong>Move</strong> 8 (Air Move 16); <strong>SM</strong> +3</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bite (20)</strong>: 3d+3 cut; Reach C,1. Can count as a grapple!</li>
  <li><strong>Front Claw (20)</strong>: 3d+3 cut, Reach C-2.</li>
  <li><strong>Hind Claw (20)</strong>: 3d+4 cut, Reach C-2.</li>
  <li><strong>Horns (20)</strong>: 3d+3 cut, Reach C,1. Counts as a weapon for attacking and
parrying.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail (18)</strong>: 3d+4 cr, or double that for knockback only. Reach C-3.</li>
  <li><strong>Wing (20)</strong>: 3d+3 cr, or double that for knockback only. Reach C-3.</li>
  <li><strong>Dominate Pawn (15)</strong>: As the Charm spell. Costs 3 FP and works only on
Pawns.</li>
  <li><strong>Fire Breath (16)</strong>: Costs 2 FP per use. 1m-wide and 10m-long cone of flame;
3d+1 burn.</li>
</ul>

(12); Nictitating Membrane 3; Night Vision 9; Penetrating Voice; Peripheral

(breath)-16; Leadership-12; Strategy-11; Tactics-11;</p>

<h3 id="the-wyrm">The Wyrm</h3>

<p>The Wyrm was once a wizard whose spells failed him when he needed them the
most. As a lesser dragon he remains quite articulate and fully cognizant of his
past life and current situation. He seeks to lair in the ancient ruins of his
city and stay out of the conflict, but will still fight the Arisen should the
two meet.</p>

<p>In an hostile encounter, the Wyrm will try to lead the PCs to an arena of his
choosing before engaging. He will prefer to fight in an enclosed, flooded ruin
chamber where his sound and ice spells are extra effective. In combat the Wyrm
relies on his spells. He might try to incapacitate his opponents with Daze of
Sleep (in single or mass versions), surprise non-Pawns by dominating them with
Charm, or cast Resist Sound on himself and attack with Concussion and
Thunderclap. His physical abilities remain formidable of course, and so does his
breath weapon.</p>

<p>That said, out of all the example lesser dragons here the Wyrm is the most
likely to be friendly if the party doesn’t include any Arisen, and could be
convinced to impart some important piece of lore or teach some of his magic by
sufficiently honey-tongued characters.</p>

<h3 id="the-wyvern">The Wyvern</h3>

<p>The Wyvern was a scout, quick and nimble, who zigged when she should have
zagged. Only recently reincarnated, she is still confused and running on little
more than instinct.</p>

<p>The Wyvern will fight any who approach her by taking to the air and doing
strafing runs with her lightning breath or front claws, which don’t incur any of
the usual penalties for Move and Attack. These can include attempts to grab a
target and drop it from a great height. She will only fight for long enough to
discourage pursuit before flying away to look for a safe place to rest, unless
the party contains an Arisen - then, as usual for lesser dragons, she will be
compelled to fight to the death.</p>

<p>The Wyvern departs from the generic template a bit more by trading the ability
to dominate pawns for a beefier than usual breath weapon and the enhanced
skirmishing ability described above.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>That’s it. I’m done with Kickstarter. It’s just too much of a hassle.</p>

<p>After an excruciating process that involved 2 permanently blocked credit cards,
a 2-week wait for the replacements to arrive, a third (thankfully virtual)
blocked card, a total of 2 hours of trying to convince the nice people at my
bank and/or credit card operator that I was myself and that I did indeed want my
card unblocked and that transaction completed, I’m finally an official backer of
the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2101297466/hall-of-judgment-a-dungeon-fantasy-rpg-supplement">Hall of Judgment campaign</a> and have the preview PDF on hand.</p>

<p>Now, the thing with all the blocked cards was a first for me<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but the rest
has been pretty much par of the course every single time I backed a KS
project. It seems like either my bank (Banco do Brasil) or VISA <em>really</em> hate
the way KS charges Brazilian cards. It always gets flagged as a security
violation and there seems to be no way to let them know beforehand that it’s
really OK. And by now I’m really tired of this whole Kafkaesque nightmare.</p>

<p>So until one or more of these corporations comes up with a better way to take my
money, I won’t back anything else on Kickstarter and will instead wait for the
stuff I’m interested in to be available through normal channels.</p>

            <p>I thought Gaming Ballistic’s Lost Hall of Tyr<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> looked like an interesting
adventure when it came out, but I didn’t buy it because it was for D&amp;D 5th
Edition. I did think at the time that it would be really nifty if it ever came
out for GURPS… and now I’m about to get my wish.</p>

<p>Gaming Ballistic has recently starter another kickstarter campaign for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2101297466/hall-of-judgment-a-dungeon-fantasy-rpg-supplement">Hall of
Judgement</a>, which is a version of the same adventure for the Dungeon Fantasy
Roleplaying Game.</p>

<p>It’s not a direct conversion. The setting part has been made a bit more generic
so it can fit into ongoing DFRPG campaigns, and the adventure itself has been
expanded to be more sandboxy, with more wilderness travel and a few sidequests
added in. It’s also the first ever licensed third-party supplement for the
DFRPG, so I’m backing this not just for the book itself but to send a message to
Steve Jackson games that I want to see more of this type of deal.</p>
