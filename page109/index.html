        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>A while ago I spent quite some time statting up Pathfinder Iconic characters for
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy</strong>, one for each template from <strong>DF1</strong>. That project even
has its own page <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">here</a>, where you can see all the completed
characters. Aside from being fun in itself (I like making characters!), the main
motivation was to provide a resource for players just getting into <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy</strong>, and into the as yet unreleased <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying
Game</strong>.</p>

<p>Well, the DFRPG is out to backers now, and will be out to everyone else pretty
soon. Now that I can get a good look at its text, I see that the difference
between it and the GURPS DF line is not unlike that between the first and second
edition of, say, AD&amp;D. A lot of things are the same, but there are enough
differences that you might need to do a little work to use material from one
game in the other.</p>

<p>And so it turned out that my set of converted Pathfinder Iconics doesn’t quite
fit the DFRPG rules, mostly because a lot of them include material from the
GURPS line that didn’t make it into the standalone boxed set. As I still want
them to be useful to players of the latter, it’s time to do a little conversion!</p>

<p>Here’s what’s going to happen: I’m going to redo all of the Iconics that
correspond to the templates present in the DFRPG boxed set, which is everyone
except for Seoni the Sorceress. Each of them is going to go up as a new article
that will be linked alongside the old one in the project page. The new PCs will
be built using <em>only</em> material found in the DFRPG boxed set, with perhaps a bit
of original material tossed in where needed (like for Lini’s racial
template). Each article will also comment on the differences between the
resulting stats.</p>

<p>Like GURPS DF versions, these are inspired by the official published bios and
stats for the iconics. Their capabilities are mostly inspired by the 7th-level
version of the stats, and their gear by the 1st-level version, since that’s
closer to what a character’s starting money can buy. This time around I’ll also
take inspiration from the GURPS DF stats, of course, since my decisions on how
to adapt stuff from d20 to GURPS haven’t really changed. I hope you enjoy the
new versions!</p>

            <p>The Doppelganger is a particularly unnerving D&amp;D monster, not because of its
direct combat power but because of its ability to look like <em>anyone</em>. Adventures
involving them tend to be the urban, intrigue-filled kind where you never know
who’s on your side and who’s been secretly replaced by a monster.</p>

<p>Eberron was the first setting to give that ability to a playable character race!
As a Changeling, you get to enjoy the ability to look like anyone… and to be
the target of a lot of prejudice from people who assume you’re secretly
replacing innocent victims, even if you’re the most saintly of paladins. With
the racial template in this article, you get to do those things in either
version of the Dungeon Fantasy game.</p>

<h2 id="changelings">Changelings</h2>

<p><strong>Racial Cost: 25 points</strong></p>

<p>Changelings are humanoids capable of altering their appearance at will. The
story of their origin varies depending on who you ask. Some say “Changeling” is
just a more polite way to call a Doppelganger. Some say the Changelings are the
offspring of a human and a <em>true</em> Doppelganger, who is much more dangerous. The
truth depends on which edition of D&amp;D you’re stealing from.</p>

<p>A changeling’s basic appearance is that of a slender, pale-skinned,
androgynous humanoid with large sunken eyes and an almost non-existent
nose. They can quickly change to look like any humanoid of similar size and
mass.</p>

<p>Changelings have no society of their own, and tend to live among humans. Their
abilities tend to give rise to lots of terrible stories about, well,
Doppelgangers, so most assume a “secret identity” in order to live peaceful
lives. Some have several, in order to have a backup in case one of their covers
is blown… and those who get too paranoid end up lending truth to those
terrible stories.</p>

<p>In times of changeling-fueled intrigue, gnomes and halflings are prized as
counter-intelligence agents. Members of both races tend to be quite crafty
themselves, and can’t be replaced by changelings due to their small size.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Changeling Shapeshifting {20}; Charisma 1 {5};
Night Vision 5 {5}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Terrible Secret {-5}.</p>

<h3 id="special-changeling-traits">Special Changeling Traits</h3>

<h4 id="changeling-shapeshifting">Changeling Shapeshifting<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></h4>

<p>By concentrating for 10 seconds, you can assume the form of any humanoid with
the same Size Modifier as you (0). Your weight remains the same and you don’t
gain any abilities with game effects posessed by that type of humanoid (but see
below). You do, however, retain your other racial advantages. Your clothing and
possessions don’t change with you.</p>

<p>The Appearance and Honest Face advantages work differently for you. Instead of
applying to your <em>natural</em> form, they allow you to assume humanoid forms that
possess these advantages. In the case of Appearance, consider the level you pay
for to be the <em>maximum</em> you can transform into. You can also take on less
good-looking forms for no extra cost. You can’t take Appearance as a
disadvantage, but changing into uglier forms doesn’t cost extra (or give you
points!).</p>

<p>This power is of obvious use in <strong>Disguise</strong> attempts. When using this skill,
you never require any tool more elaborate than a change of clothes, and need at
most 5 minutes of preparation instead of the 30 required by others. You also
never suffer penalties for race-crossing or trying to disguise yourself as
someone “very different”. Copying the appearance of a specific person always
requires a <strong>Disguise</strong> roll.</p>

<h4 id="terrible-secret">Terrible Secret<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></h4>

<p>“Civilized” society considers you a monster, but you are usually able to hide
your true nature. The GM rolls 3d every time you go to town or start a session
there. On a 6 or less, your cover is blown and you suffer the effects of Social
Stigma (Savage) - including another immediate 3d roll to see if you’re kicked
out of town! This lasts until you can re-establish your cover. How you can do
that is up to the GM. It could range from a few skill rolls to a full adventure!</p>

<h3 id="optional-traits">Optional Traits</h3>

<p>Changelings can always buy the Disguise and Acting skills even if those aren’t
part of their professional template. Even honest changelings often need these
skills to escape persecution.</p>

</figure>

<p>Changelings often become delvers - it’s the only line of work where they don’t
look much weirder than their colleagues. They do particularly well as Bards and
Thieves! Even on the pure dungeon-crawling campaigns assumed by the default
Dungeon Fantasy setup, their shape-changing ability can eliminate some reaction
penalties from humanoid monsters if the character has time to prepare for the
encounter (“You can trust me, I’m an orc too.”). They could also infiltrate a
group of such monsters and gather precious information about the enemy. In
campaigns with more social interaction or even intrigue, their utility
skyrockets.</p>

<p>Changeling names tend to be short, unisex affairs: Qin, Kell, Tan, and so
on. Most go by a pseudonym when in their cover identities, and some just are
just given names from the society where they grew up from the start. Most
changelings tend to think of themselves as being whatever gender matches their
current form, though some do have a stronger preference for a single identity.</p>

            <p>Eberron is pretty much my favorite published D&amp;D setting, and Warforged are my
favorite Eberron race. What would they look like in Dungeon Fantasy? Let’s find
out!</p>

<p>In the racial template below I’ve tried to follow the same guidelines as the
races in the <strong>DFRPG</strong>: they must alter the character enough for you to feel
like you’re playing a member of that race, and they can’t cost more than about
40 points. This should allow characters following almost any professional
template to be a Warforged if they so wish.</p>

<h2 id="warforged">Warforged</h2>

  by Will-E-H</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Racial Cost: 30 points</strong></p>

<p>Warforged are living constructs. In Eberron, they were created and mass-produced
by a powerful enchanter house, which sold them as ready-made armies to some of
that setting’s warring nations. Once the war was over, most were freed and given
citizenship. In other settings, their origins are usually less industrial: a
warforged delver might be an experiment by a lone wizard, a relic from a lost
civilization who was only activated now, and so on.</p>

<p>Warforged are more or less human-sized and -shaped, but are obviously made of
metal, wood, and stone rather than flesh. Most look nearly identical save for
the mystic sigil in their foreheads, which is different for every individual. A
few have taken the time to customize their bodies and individualize their
appearance.</p>

<p>Warforged are a little stronger than humans, but their real advantage over human
soldiers lies in ther immunity to most weaknesses of the flesh. They don’t need
food, water or even air, and though they must spend some time at rest each day,
they don’t really sleep either. Unlike a “proper” golem, a warforged has a fully
sapient mind and soul, too.</p>

<p>They are still <em>alive</em>, though, and still subject to some of those fleshy
weaknesses. They have and can spend Fatigue Points. They are not considered
Unliving or Homogenous, and still vulnerable to poisons and such that enter
their bodies via means other than breathing or ingestion. They can be affected
by Mind Control spells and other similar magic. And no-mana areas are deadly to
them, which is something most other delvers don’t need to worry about. On the
good side, Healing magic works fine on Warforged.</p>

<p>Even a newly-created Warforged will have the skills of a veteran fighter and an
adult-level intellect, but that individual will also lack most of the social
graces you would expect from someone with an adult-level intellect. Even after
they overcome this initial awkwardness, people still tend to look at then a bit
oddly given their exotic appearance and origin.</p>

<p><strong>Attribute Modifiers</strong>: ST+1 {10}; HT+1 {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong>: Composite Plating 1 {5}; Doesn’t Breathe {20}; Doesn’t Eat or
Drink {10}; Unsleeping Watcher {10}.</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>: Dependency (Mana) {-25}; Social Stigma (Minority Group)
{-10}.</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong> Individuals look very similar to each other.</p>

<h3 id="special-warforged-traits">Special Warforged Traits</h3>

<h4 id="composite-plating">Composite Plating<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></h4>

<p>Your skin is made of metal and wooden plates. This works like one level of the
Barbarian’s Tough Skin (<strong>DRRPG Adventurers</strong>, p. 16), but it’s <em>not</em> flesh! It
does protect against attacks that require a scratch or skin contact but don’t
manage to get past its DR. You can still wear armor normally.</p>

<p>At the GM’s option, a warforged character might be able to buy up to two more
levels of this trait in play. It requires spending some time in a machine shop
along with 5 points and $500 per level.</p>

<h4 id="dependency-mana">Dependency (Mana)</h4>

<p>As the monster trait on <strong>DFRPG: Monsters</strong>, p. 13. You lose 1 HP per minute
you spend in a no mana area.</p>

<h4 id="doesnt-breathedoesnt-eat-or-drink">Doesn’t Breathe/Doesn’t Eat or Drink</h4>

<p>As the monster traits in <strong>DFRPG: Monsters</strong>, p. 10.</p>

<h4 id="unsleeping-watcher">Unsleeping Watcher<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></h4>

<p>Instead of sleeping, you must enter a state of inactivity for at least 4 hours
per day. While in this state, you remain conscious and aware of your
surroundings, so you <em>can</em> keep watch while resting. If you can’t rest like this
on a given day, treat it as a night of missed sleep.</p>

<h3 id="optional-traits">Optional Traits</h3>

<p>Warforged characters may add the following disadvantages to the list of optional
traits for their professional template, if those aren’t already there: Chummy
{-5}; Clueless {-10}; Gregarious {-10}; Gullibility {-10}; Code of Honor
(Soldier’s) {-10}. These represent the social awkwardness or initial programming
of a newly-created warforged. Since they are personal disadvantages, they do
count toward your disadvantage limit.</p>

</figure>

<p>While warforged were made to be members of the fightier professions, they can do
equally well at any of them! That little bit of extra DR will come in handy to
delvers who have to rely on lighter armor. Warforged are an excellent choice for
players who don’t want to bother with buying rations and sleeping bags, or
succumbing to poison gas traps. On the other hand, they have social difficulties
in town, and their fleshbag buddies will always ask them to take the watch when
setting up camp.</p>

<p>Warforged gender is mostly a matter of personal preference, perhaps accompanied
by the use of the Armory skill. Warforged usually choose names from the culture
in which they live, but some prefer simple one-word names that allude to their
vocation or personality. A holy warrior who lives to protect the weak might name
himself Shield, and there’s that one guy who called himself Awesome Bucket.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I’m a little later to this party than I thought I’d be, but here it goes
anyway. <strong>Pyramid #3/106</strong> is the first issue of the magazine to be released
after the completion of the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong>. While the game
itself is still not available to the public at the time of this writing, the
many Kickstarter backers have started receiving their copies. I guess this issue
is meant to both appeal to them and to get other players interested in the
upcoming game.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-it">What’s In It?</h2>

<p>The cover is an illustration from the game itself, depicting an armored knight
and a wizard or druid cautiously advancing through a tunnel whose walls are
covered in glowing sigils. Maybe it’s the style of the knight’s armor, but the
piece gives me a bit of a Dark Souls vibe.</p>

<p>After the usual introductory blurbs about what’s in the issue, we get the first
“real” article: <em>Designer’s Notes</em> for the DFRPG, by Sean Punch himself. It
tells us what it was like to write the game, and gives us an incredibly detailed
account of what’s in each of its books (including the stretch goals and add-ons)
and how that content differs from what’s in the <strong>Basic Set</strong>. If none of the
excellent DFRPG reviews published on the Internet so far have answered all of
your questions about the game, then it might be worth buying this issue for the
six pages of designer’s notes alone - you won’t get a more complete description
without reading the game itself.</p>

<p>Next comes an article on <em>Quick Equipment Kits</em>, by Peter V. Dell’Orto. It has
loadouts in it, which is good because I love loadouts! The article is only four
pages long, so if you <em>don’t</em> love loadouts you can rest assured that this isn’t
reprinting the whole of <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 13</strong> for the new “edition”. This
article leaves weapon and armor selection entirely to players, and instead
focuses on all the <em>other</em> stuff. It has a basic delver package with a minimum
of generally useful gear like ropes and blankets. It then presents a set of
add-ons separated not by character template, but by function within the party:
Cartographer, Door Breaker, Medic, and so on. It also devotes some space to
pre-filled quivers of arrows or bolts, pre-filled bags of sling stones, and bulk
rations of all kinds, which are nifty time-savers all by themselves.</p>

<p>Next comes a whole bunch of <em>Deathtraps</em> by Cristopher R. Rice. While I haven’t
gotten around to reading the <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Traps</strong> PDF, I’m told these are
much more cruel than the ones on that book. This makes this a useful tool for
GMs who want to go Gygaxian on their players with false-door crossbow traps or
the Magical Magnetic Murder Machine.</p>

<p>In the Eidetic Memory column, David Pulver talks about <em>Demi-Human
Dungeons</em>. Contrary to what you’d expect from a David Pulver article, there are
no math-intensive rules here. Rather, this is a nice set of guidelines for
designing dungeons built by dwarves, halflings, elves and gnomes. Why would each
of these peoples build a large underground complex? What would they use it for?
How can it fall into ruin and be infested by monsters, and what treasure would
be left behind? Given that the implied Dungeon Fantasy setting is built on
well-worn cliches, the answers will probably not come as big surprises to
veteran GMs, but the descriptions are clear and filled with interesting
references in their examples. Do you want to know what it would be like to delve
into the shattered ruins of Bag End? Read this.</p>

<p><em>Secrets of the Living Tomb</em> by Steven Marsh details the dungeon from the solo
adventure in Pyramid #3/104 in a GM-friendly format, complete with some
backstory and possible campaign hooks. I only skimmed this one, as I intend to
play the adventure eventually.</p>

<p><em>Undead, Undead Everywhere</em> by Sean Punch gives us six new undead monsters to
play with. You have two new varieties of zombie (drowned and frozen), Swamp
Wisps made of toxic gas, and Mummies which are every bit as dangerous as their
OD&amp;D counterparts. There’s also a couple of more exotic selections in the Herd
Horrors and the Tomb Trees. The Mummies and the two “exotics” were by far the
most interesting ones to me, though I liked all of them because you can never
have enough monsters.</p>

<p><em>The State of the Dungeon</em> is a short update on where in the official release
process the game is. It’s close to the end, but not there yet. It does focus
more on the physical product, which makes me think widely available PDF versions
might take a while longer than that to show up, if they do at all. Personally, I
would like to see them earlier rather than later. I already have mine, but I
want something to link to people who are averse to shipping charges.</p>

<p>We end with a <em>Random Thought Table</em> by Steven Marsh on simplifying things to
ease players into the Dungeon Fantasy RPG. It’s mainly a big old plug for the
<strong>Delvers To Go!</strong> supplement, but some of the suggestions here are also
interesting.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-think-of-it">What Do I Think of It?</h2>

<p>Overall, I quite liked this issue, and found it to be worth the price. My
personal favorites were <em>Quick Equipment Kits</em> and <em>Undead, Undead Everywhere</em>,
with <em>Demi-Human Dungeons</em> coming in close behind.</p>

            <p>Looks like my “real-time” gaming group liked the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/08/08/planet-mercenary-actual-play.html">first session</a> of the
Damaxuri Deception so much that they decided to alternate between D&amp;D 5th
Edition and Planet Mercenary until we’re done with it. This made me quite happy,
because I missed being the GM and the system is quite fun. Descriptions for our
cast of player characters can be found <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/08/07/planet-mercenary-actual-play.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rumble-at-the-warehouse">Rumble at the Warehouse</h2>

<p>When we last left Skynet’s Avengers, they had just defeated a bunch of Kostavi’s
thugs guarding a fake hideout, and interrogated the survivor before leaving the
scene of the fight. The guy told them Kostavi had holed up in <em>another</em>
abandoned warehouse with a small army of henchthings. This other warehouse had a
cargo elevator that led right into the building from the spaceport on the
surface.</p>

<p>The party figured that if they were the ones hiding, they would play to use the
shaft as an escape route. After arguing about it for a while they came up with
the following plan: Rufus and his fireteam would go topside and infiltrate the
warehouse through the elevator shaft, while the rest of the company performed a
frontal assault on the warehouse. This would trap the enemies inside and give
the Avengers an edge in the fight.</p>

<p>There was one small wrinkle in that plan: the elevator door was locked! It had a
big “Out of Order” sign on it, behind which hid a fairly sophisticated lock. The
PCs would need to hack that lock or find another way to open the door.</p>

<p>So Orangus decided he would build a bomb. He didn’t have any boomex, and the
company had no money with which to buy some, so he used household chemicals,
random debris and a large trash can to build a home-brewed monstrosity. He
succeeded by just enough to build <em>something</em>, drew the “Spit, Balling Wire and
Brass Ball Bearings” Mayhem card, and succeeded in the Engineering roll it asked
for despite not having the skill. The effect of that of course went into the
bomb, which I ruled was what allowed it to breach the door when it went off.</p>

<p>With the bomb in place, they split up according to the plan, and begun the
assault. Kostavi’s hideout was protected on the outside by a pair of minigun
drones disguised as trash cans, and once the shooting started someone fired a
rocket through the door from within, nearly missing Orangus.</p>

<p>It’s here that the party was formally introduced to what I call the Powered
Armor Conundrum. Heavy armor in <strong>Planet Mercenary</strong> has 1 Hull Point, making it
equivalent to an armored vehicle. This means it and its wearer can only be hurt
by anti-vehicular weapons. However, even one hit by such a weapon will destroy
the <em>ruinously expensive</em> suit, which means PCs wearing the best armor are the
ones most afraid of being hit in any fight involving heavy weapons. Such as this
one.</p>

<p>Aside from the two drones, Kostavi had four goon squads inside the warehouse,
hiding amongst piles of containers arranged to serve as cover. I ruled one of
these had rocket launchers - they’d still do the damage listed in their basic
stat block, but that damage would have the Anti-Vehicular Payload tag. That
prevented Orangus from running amok without fear of being hit.</p>

<p>Kostavi herself was in a suit of flying powered armor equipped with a rocket
launcher and plasma cannon, in addition to a Goaltender drone. She fought openly
until Orangus managed to tag her with a plasma bolt and destroy her armor. From
that point on, her tactic consisted of hiding and sneaking around the warehouse
while her goons distracted the PCs, taking every opportunity to snipe at the
geatest threats. When Rufus revealed himself, it became obvious that the
greatest threat was <em>him</em>, since he was blocking Kostavi’s retreat.</p>

<p>Kostavi broadcast that she had a bomb tied to a heart monitor, and would
manually detonate it unless the PCs stood down and let her leave. The PCs called
her bluff and kept fighting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I never managed to hit anyone with a heavy weapon - the players
wisely began to use one action each turn to dodge, and kept rolling well on
those attempts. Some of the more lightly armored characters did get hit. I told
them how much damage they would suffer and gave them a chance to spend a RiPP on
Ablative Meat, which meant that the rule got used fairly often. Thus did poor
Jonas from the grunt pool meet his death in battle. Other uses of the rule
caused one Leto’s Joy clones to be named Joy Katislene<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and Rufus to remind
me that he named most of his fireteam after the cast of Avatar: The Last
Airbender.</p>

<p>Rufus was in a particularly bad position here because a lot of enemies were
targetting him, and I ruled that since he on the opposite side of the
battlefield from most of the company he didn’t have access to the Grunt Pool for
Ablative Meat purposes. He also didn’t remember to dodge in the first few
rounds. Fortunately, his grunts were lucky, and would survive to complain about
him another day.</p>

<p>Soon the party began to spend more actions looking for Kostavi in the middle of
the fight than actually fighting! The problem here was that only Orangus and Max
had even middling Perception, and she had a Stealth of 11 and rolled really
well.</p>

<p>Orangus decides he’s going to end this swiftly by finding the best place to
plant a bomb on this building and doing that. He not only found the perfect
spot, but also found that someone had already planted a bomb there. A <em>nuclear</em>
bomb. That bluff wasn’t quite as bluffy as they thought!</p>

<p>Orangus recognizes the device as an Urthreep Industries Dial-a-Yield, which is
currently set to something equivalent to 1 ton of TNT. He decides to disarm it
right then and there, and between his high Demolitions skill, his specialty in
Disarming and generous RiPP expenditure, manages to roll a 23. The bomb is
deactivated!</p>

<p>Kostavi still eludes them for a while longer. Finally I turn to Leto, whose turn
it was at the time:</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: Pay me one RiPP and I’ll let you find Kostavi.</p>

<p>So Leto spots her hiding out aways from the main body of the fight, lining up
another shot, and communicates her location to the company. Rufus leaves his
position to charge hers, and attempts to subdue Kostavi in unarmed combat. She
nimbly dodges away and shoots him point-blank with a plasma cannon.</p>

<p>Now, some time before the fight started, Rufus had drawn the “Oh Captain, My
Captain” Mayhem card. This card can be invoked when the PC in question is about
to take damage and has the effect of applying the damage to the Captain instead,
essentially using them as free Ablative Meat for that attack.</p>

<p>I initially considered voiding the card, since the company Captain is Skynet,
which is also <em>their ship</em>. Then I decided I would come up with something if the
card came into play, and told him to keep it. Since Rufus was more afraid of
losing his extremely pricey EX Supersuit than of losing his captain, he used the
card when Kostavi hit him.</p>

<p>This means that the sound of an explosion was heard over the company comms, and
Skynet cooly ordered them to finish that firefight already and come help her
repel these pesky boarders. So yeah, Rufus was safe but the Captain took a hit.</p>

<p>The fight did end soon after that, when Leto attempted to charge Kostavi and
melee her. He had a Melee of 1, she had a Defense of 18, he rolled a
natural 17. Leto does a fixed 11 damage with his claws, which left Kostavi with
1 hp. I ruled she had been squashed like a bug and was unconscious.</p>

<p>Leto broadcasts to the enemies that he has their boss and that if they don’t
stand down he’ll finish her off and make the bomb explode. The bomb in question
has been very publically disarmed, so I he rolls Bluff to make the threat
stick. It turns out Kostavi is so underhanded her goons are ready to believe she
had another bomb hidden somewhere. They drop their weapons and surrender. The
party lets them leave, since they claim they were just hired muscle and that’s
something they can empathize with. Their stuff stays, of course.</p>

<h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s All, Folks!</h2>

<p>And that’s where we stopped the session, since we were out of time. The party
has to take the unconscious Kostavi to the authorities without getting
implicated in the many shootouts and explosions they engaged in, and now they
also have the matter of the boarders currently trying to enter their ship<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Who are these boarders? I don’t know yet! We are entering uncharted territory
here, since that bit isn’t in the published adventure. I have two weeks to come
up with them.</p>

<p>This session was a little more “rules-intensive” from my point of view, which
left less space for levity. The players, however, told me they found it even
more fun than the first session, so I’m happy. I discovered I was operating
under a slight misconception regarding Mayhem: only <em>players</em> draw Mayhem cards,
and only when the test in question <em>succeeds</em>. Before this, they managed to turn
at least one failure into a success due to a serendipitous Mayhem draw.</p>

<p>For the next session I’ll also refresh my memory on how goon squads work - for
this fight, I ruled that a non-area-effect attack would kill at most one
individual in the squad, so even though the goons only had 2hp apiece it took 3
successful attacks to take the whole squad out. It made them a suitable threat
for the players and their up-gunned fireteams.</p>
