  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we learned about the cosmology of Athas early in the Campaign
Setting reading is that its Shadowfell is locally known as the Gray, and it’s
suspected to block access to the Astral Sea and any other worlds beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This becomes relevant here, because the people known as the Gith are said to
have arrived on Athas long ago, sailing from beyond the Gray in silvery
ships. Once here, however, they found out they couldn’t go back. To make matters
worse, these alien visitors found out that they were particularly susceptible to
the corruptive influences of Athasian arcane magic, which turned them Darker and
Sunnier over the generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present-day gith are more monstrous in appearance than the ones you’re used
to. Their mindset is also more monstrous, which is saying something considering
these were probably githyanki invaders to start with. Despite the mutations
they’ve undergone, they retain their psychic abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gith organize in nomadic hunter communities, wandering through the moutains and
the Tablelands region. They make no particular distinction between standard
animals and sapient outsiders when it comes to chosing their prey, and think
both make fine eating. Some Gith groups are dedicated to gathering the scattered
parts of their original ships, hoping to reassemble them so they can get off
this rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gith are Medium Natural Humanoids with Speed 6. Their signature power is the
same as that of standard githyanki: &lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic Leap&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter power
that lets them fly 5 squares as a move action. Other attacks and abilities vary
with training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gith-savage&quot;&gt;Gith Savage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rank-and-file of any large gith raiding force, the book describes their
lives as nasty, brutish, and short. These Level 4 Minion Skirmishers fight with
obsidian-tipped spears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gith’s basic &lt;strong&gt;Spear&lt;/strong&gt; attack damages and lets it shift 1 square. Once per
encounter they can enhance one attack into a &lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic Pierce&lt;/strong&gt;, which
targets Fortitude, deals the same damage and pushes the target 1 square. I think
this above might be the first psychic power I’ve seen that &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; target
Will. There are a few others in this entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gith-hobbler&quot;&gt;Gith Hobbler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These hunters are level 4 Artillery with 46 HP. They prefer to stay far away
throwing Range 20 &lt;strong&gt;Javelins&lt;/strong&gt;. Once per encounter they can throw a particularly
well-aimed &lt;strong&gt;Pinning Javelin&lt;/strong&gt;, that does a bit more damage and immobilizes
(save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone gets too close, they’re subject to the hobbler’s aura (1) of &lt;strong&gt;Brain
Fog&lt;/strong&gt;, which inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks and damage to enemies inside. I
wonder if there’s one of these near me these days. Someone who insists on
attacking them in melee might force the hobbler to use its &lt;strong&gt;bone dagger&lt;/strong&gt;,
which does light damage and lets them shift 1 square on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gith-spearhead&quot;&gt;Gith Spearhead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A front-line fighter wielding a barbed obsidian-headed spear. It’s a Level 5
Brute with 76 HP. The &lt;strong&gt;Vicious Spear&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty strong, as expected of a
brute, and can be used in a &lt;strong&gt;Focused Stab&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+) that deals more
damage and knocks prone. If the target is bloodied, the attack deals &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt;
damage and dazes (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the spearhead is reduced to 0 HP, it lets out an &lt;strong&gt;Ancestor’s Appeal&lt;/strong&gt;, a
Close Burst 1 that targets Fortitude and deals psychic damage. In addition to
the damage, a hit also inflicts ongoing 5 psychic damage, and a further 5
psychic damage whenever the target uses a daily or encounter power (save ends
both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;git-drone&quot;&gt;Git Drone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drones are gith that show increased psychic aptitude as children, and are
subject to a torturous training regimen to further develop their powers. They’re
Level 5 Controllers with 62 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drones emit a &lt;strong&gt;Brain Fog&lt;/strong&gt; aura that works like the hobbler’s, but is much
wider in radius (3). They fight with &lt;strong&gt;Bone Daggers&lt;/strong&gt; in melee and with
&lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic Thrusts&lt;/strong&gt; at up to range 5. These deal force damage, and slide 2
squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every so often they can use a &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Nova&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+). This is an Area
Burst 1 Within 5 that targets Reflex, deals untyped damage, and makes the target
suffer 5 psychic damage whenever they use a daily or encounter power (save
ends). If the target is bloodied, it instead deals ongoing 5 damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one time I briefly played a Dark Sun game, one of the PCs was a “standard”
gith fighter, so I had thought the gith of Athas were both unchanged from their
astral relatives and playable. Turns out I was wrong! Mechanically they’re still
similar to githyanki, but their look and feel is pretty different than what I
expected, and there are no rules for gith PCs in the Campaign Setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gith are commonly found in all-gith hunting parties, perhaps accompanied by
domesticated baazrags or other trained beasties. They can also be found in mixed
parties of People, whether as willing members or as slaves commanded to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quar and Their Guns in GURPS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I became aware of the Quar. Aren’t they neat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/quar-unit.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These funny anteater people are the stars of a couple of miniature wargames, the
28mm-scale &lt;strong&gt;Clash of Rhyfles&lt;/strong&gt; and the 15mm-scale &lt;strong&gt;This Quar’s War&lt;/strong&gt;. Both of
these have their rulebooks freely available &lt;a href=&quot;https://rhyfler.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which is also where the
image above comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An individual Quar is a funny little person who just wants to chill with a hot
cup of tea and a plate of moth cakes. Quar &lt;em&gt;societies&lt;/em&gt; however are very, er,
quarrelsome, so most of their history is an endless procession of wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was motivated to write this article both because I think the setting is neat,
and because the technical information about Quar weapons in the Clash of Rhyfles
game made me think I can stat them up in GURPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;very-short-setting-summary&quot;&gt;Very Short Setting Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wargames cover a particularly turbulent period in the history of Aldwyn, the
Quar home world. It’s marked by at least twenty years of worldwide trench
warfare between two large multinational coalitions. The tech level is somewhere
between WW1 and WW2, and this is pretty much the war that introduced industrial
warfare to their world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the idea of these adorable creatures being fed into one of the worst
meat-grinders imaginable is horrifying to you, then you get the setting’s main
idea. I’ve heard it described as “grimsical”. It replaces the “dark” vibe from
“grimdark” with “whimsical”, but it’s still grim. The cuter the miniatures for
their soldiers and tanks get, the stronger the dissonance becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Clash or Rhyfles quickstart book centers on the two main factions of the
war. The Crusade is a coalition of former monarchies who successfully toppled
their old regimes and became republics. They’re led by the Republic of Tok, and
made up of many smaller nations that follow the same standards for equipment and
tactics. The rules here could be used for quar from any of those places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, the Kingdom of Coftyr leads an alliance of the world’s
remaining monarchies to stamp out this revolution. Each kingdom here tends to be
visually distinct, as their whole thing is adherence to ancient traditions and
heraldry. Therefore, the book only covers Coftyr itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free add-ons provide details for “sub-factions” allied to either side. These are
Crusader or monarchist nations who do their own thing on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual for wargames, both sides are morally ambiguous. Opposing monarchy is a
good thing in my book, but the Crusade is also the side that introduced
industrial warfare to the world. Coftyr flavor text is all about honor and
chivalry and heroism, but they adopted industrial warfare just as readily and at
the end of the day are still defenders of absolute monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get the impression that the world of Alwyn could settle into a more or less
stable configuration if everyone just stopped and signed a status quo peace
treaty, but they’ve all been fighting for 20 years by now and none of their
leaders show any sign of wanting to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual for wargames, you pick the side you think looks neater, paint them up,
and pit them against other factions in battles that would fit somewhere in those
decades of war. Most of these battles focus on infantry with the occasional
tanks thrown in. There seem to be airships, but I don’t know if they have
airplanes yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quar-in-gurps&quot;&gt;Quar in GURPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical Quar is about 1.5 meters tall and weights around 60kg. They follow a
largely humanoid body plan. Their skins can take on any of a large number of
hues, from yellows and greens to blues and purples and oranges. Often, they’re a
little mottled. Their diet tends to include lots of bugs, though those are often
prepared as ingredients in dishes that we would otherwise recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stat-wise, I’d say they are absolutely identical to humans. If you insist on
being strict, make them about a foot shorter than their ST would indicate, but
do not adjust their stats in any other way. Being a Quar costs 0 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that’s the thing, you see? Quar are just people. The horrors inflicted
on them are horrible because &lt;em&gt;war&lt;/em&gt; is horrible, not because Quar are adorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quar-guns-in-gurps&quot;&gt;Quar Guns in GURPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guns in Clash or Rhyfles don’t actually have damage ratings, just range and
optional traits. The results of a ranged attack roll depend entirely on the
degree of success for your skill roll. They might leave a target unaffected,
Gobsmacked (stunned) or Taken Out, which is different from “dead”: they might
still be rescued during or after the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the skirmish game rules include enough fluff about the infantry weapons
of the Crusade that I kinda want to try statting them up in GURPS. If I ever get
the same information for the Coftyri ones, I’ll stat them up too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book mentiones the muzzle velocity and caliber of a couple of the weapons,
and if I make a guess about the weight of the bullet I can plug those three
things in the simplest possible version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamingballistic.com/2022/04/11/old-ballistics-spreadsheet-a-repost/&quot;&gt;unofficial official GURPS
ballistics equation&lt;/a&gt; to get a damage figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That link also contains a complete spreadsheet that demands things like chamber
pressure, which I have no chance of figuring out. So stuff like Accuracy and
range will be derived by the older method of eyeballing existing guns, as will
bullet weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers in the original material are just there for color, of course. None
of them affect the rules of the miniature wargame itself. But if we take them as
true, we see that Quar are very fond guns with big bullets and powerful
propellant charges, fired out of guns with short barrels and very light
construction. The recoil on those is gonna be ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bogen-rifle&quot;&gt;The Bogen Rifle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signature weapon of the Crusade rhyfler, the Bogen semi-automatic rifle is
said to fire a 12mm bullet at 580m/s. It uses a 5 or 10 round magazine and
weights 2.4kg “fully loaded”. Its effective range is 150-250 meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest real-world bullet to this one in GURPS High-Tech is the
.45-something family of rifle rounds, which are 11.43mm in diameter and weight
31 grams. After some fiddling, I decide to go with a slightly lower 27 grams for
the Quar bullet, which gives us exactly 7d damage. This is pi+ because of the
caliber. Picture them as being broader, shorter and rounder than Earth rifle
cartridges, which is in theme for all things Quar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives us a gun that packs about the same punch as a real-world M1 Garand
rifle while having almost exactly half its weight and about the length of an M16
assault rifle. That’s going to have a significant kick, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bogen&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7d pi+&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;900/3500&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.4kg/0.36kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5(3)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;11†&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rhyshi-r4-heavy-rifle&quot;&gt;The Rhyshi (R4) Heavy Rifle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only slightly longer than the Bogen, the Rhyshi fires a huge 20mm round with a
720m/s muzzle velocity. Its magazine carries seven of those, and it’s said to
require a solid stance and firm support to shoot with any kind of accuracy. A
squad mate’s shoulder will do for support, according to the book, but I’m going
to give this rifle an integral folding bipod because I’m not a monster. A
properly braced R4 has greater range than the Bogen, and can penetrate up to
“medium” vehicular armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest thing to this I can find on High-Tech is the Mauser Tank-Gewehr 18,
the WW1 German anti-tank rifle. Its caliber is “only” 13mm, but it’s the largest
anti-tank rifle in that table that is even removely Quar-portable. Plugging its
bullet mass, caliber and printed velocity in our magic spreadsheet, we get 10d+3
damage, which following High-Tech convention can be rounded and written as
5dx2. Let’s also give it an armor-piercing round, because I see the WW1 tank
examples in the book have DR 45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5dx2 is the same damage as the T-Gew18, but the Rhyshi again weights less than
half of what the real gun does. It’s not that much longer than the Bogen either,
so it’s gonna be a beast to handle unless it’s properly braced. As the book
says, Quar Crusaders frequently attach a bayonet to the Rhyshi because there’s
no way it can be fired in close quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Rhyshi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5dx2(2) pi+&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1100/4400&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7.5kg/1kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7(3)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;18B†&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grifkis-shotgun&quot;&gt;Grifkis Shotgun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a 10-gauge, six-kilo trench gun firing buckshot ammo. The only Crusade
gun to still be largely hand-made, it’s carried by officers as a badge of honor
and a symbol of courage. The illustration shows its barrel is fairly short, but
it still has a shoulder stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need to fiddle with spreadsheets this time, we have a 10G double-barrel
shotgun in High Tech. Let’s borrow its stats and adjust for the shortened
“whippet” barrels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Grifkis&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2d-1 pi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;40/800&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6kg/0.15kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2x13&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2(3i)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;12†&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;1/7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short barrels give this gun a more pronounced muzzle blast (+1 to Hearing
and Vision to locate when fired in the dark). I’m using the listed weight for it
here, which makes it about 50% heavier than the real world example from
High-Tech. Big caliber, two barrels, extra chonky? This is basically the Doom
Super Shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;h-11a-light-machine-gun&quot;&gt;H-11a Light Machine Gun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the book, this LMG fires the same round as the Bogen rifle, and the
Crusade likes to use it as an offensive squad support weapon. It appears longer
than the rifle, and can also be used in vehicular mounts when the force can’t
find heavier MGs to put in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’m just going to crib from High-Tech again, and blend some of the
Bogen’s stats with those of the MG34.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;H-11a&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7d pi+&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;900/3500&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;15kg/2.5kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;50(5)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;12B†&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives us a gun that’s actually heavier than the Rhyshi rifle, and whose
recoil is manageable enough that it’s worth firing more than one bullet per
turn. It fires rounds from a non-disintegrating cloth belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at those things. Just look at them. Their damage values combined with the
light weight and short barrel means they have &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt; powder charges. Quar
like big booms and they cannot lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recoil on these things means the act of firing them is somewhere between
“comical” and “painful for the shooter”. I’m guessing that a Taken Out result in
the wargame very often means the target got spooked and decided to play dead,
instead of actually being hit. This also explains why a quar can take
&lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; out on a bad skill roll.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Giant</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athas has a lot of the same giants we can see in the Monster Manuals and Monster
Vault. Athasian giants are less militarily aggressive than their counterparts in
other worlds, but they still don’t like interacting with the “small folk”. They
prefer to make their homes in isolated islands on the Silt Sea. A giant who
wants to visit the mainland can often just &lt;em&gt;wade through&lt;/em&gt; what to them is
chest-high silt. PCs might be able to negotiate a ride with such a giant, if
they’re diplomatic enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this entry we’ll take a look at two Athas-specific giants, whose descriptions
will help explain why they don’t like the small ones very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beast-giants&quot;&gt;Beast Giants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-giant-beast.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beast Giants are the product of psionic experimentation by ancient masters of
the Way, who have stabilized into their own species. They have bodies similar to
that of hill giants, but the heads of beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each giant’s head is different, and can be similar to that of any Athasian
beast, whether currently living or extinct. So PCs might be faced with something
familiar like a Cilops or Baazrag-headed giant, or with some exotic ancient
cryptid like a lion, tiger or bear. Oh my! Their skill at mind-reading is such
that they can copy most techniques used against them on the fly during a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beast Giants are fairly cosmopolitan sorts and frequently associate with other
types of giant and giant-kin who share their islands: hill giants, firbolgs,
brohgs, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beast-giant&quot;&gt;Beast Giant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical beast giant is Large Natural Humanoid (Giant) and a Level 15 Brute
with 180 HP and a ground speed of 7 and Low-light Vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what their head looks like, it gives them a &lt;strong&gt;Rending Bite&lt;/strong&gt; that
deals heavy immediate damage and ongoing 5 damage (save ends). Once per
encounter they can use the &lt;strong&gt;Red of Tooth&lt;/strong&gt; power to make three bite attacks on
the same action, each against a different target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone attacks a beast giant, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Retention&lt;/strong&gt; as a
reaction. They still suffer the damage and any riders normally, but they also
“retain” that result, so keep a note of it. They can then use this to power
their &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Release&lt;/strong&gt; attack (melee 2 vs. Fortitude). A hit deals the exact
same amount and type of damage, and the exact same riders, as the giant’s
“retained” attack. Psionic Release recharges when the giant uses Psionic
Retention again, so it effectively “spends” the retained attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beast-titan&quot;&gt;Beast Titan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oldest Beast Giants have grown enough in power and size to qualify as Beast
Titans. They’re a lot more aggressive than their younger counterparts and love
displaying the skulls of their enemies as trophies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are Huge instead of Large, and they’re Level 20 Elite Brutes with 466
HP. Their ground speed is an 8, and their &lt;strong&gt;Beast Reflexes&lt;/strong&gt; let them roll a
save to avoid falling prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their Psionic Retention and Release powers work the same as the giant’s, with
the greater range and numbers from their larger size and level. Their &lt;strong&gt;Gnashing
Bite&lt;/strong&gt; is also upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action the titan can use &lt;strong&gt;Titan’s Embrace&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 3 vs. reflex) to
do some light damage and grab on a hit. And once it has a grabbed victim, it can
use &lt;strong&gt;Head Rip&lt;/strong&gt; to deal massive damage, plus the same ongoing damage as the
bite. The giant also throws the victim 10 squares and knocks it prone at the
end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shadow-giant&quot;&gt;Shadow Giant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Death Giants of the monster manual, who are merely death-_themed_,
Shadow Giants are actual undead. They’re vengeful spirits who seek retribution
from an ancient slaughter, likely from the Red Age. They look like shadows cast
on a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tend to be loners, or to ally with those giants that still retain a strong
elemental connection (like fire and stone giants). Sometimes, a brohg renegade
will seek them out to learn the ancient arcane secrets the shadow still
rememebers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow Giants are Large Shadow Humanoids with the Undead and Giant tags, and
Level 18 Soldiers with 185 HP. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 7, and a
flight speed of 3. Like most undead, they are immune to disease and poison and
have 20 necrotic resistance. They’re also insubstantial, but lack Phasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shadow giant projects an aura (5) of &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Malaise&lt;/strong&gt; that halves any
healing that takes place inside. Whenever they take radiant damage, they’re
&lt;strong&gt;Revealed by Radiance&lt;/strong&gt; and become substantial for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Necrotic Touch&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets Reflex, deals necrotic
damage, and marks on a hit (save ends). They also have a non-basic &lt;strong&gt;Death
Touch&lt;/strong&gt; that is similar, but exchanges some of its direct damage for an
additional ongoing 10 necrotic damage rider (save ends both this and the mark).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a marked enemy makes an attack that doesn’t include the giant, they are
&lt;strong&gt;Cast Into Shadow&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction. This is a melee attack that targets
Reflex. A hit does no damage, but removes the target from play for a turn! This
means they’re stunned and removed from the map, reappearing at their previous
position when the effect ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The giant’s ability to possibly mark multiple PCs makes it a very effective
“defender”. Cast Into Shadow is a very potent “save or suck” attack, so PCs will
have an extra incentive to focus on the giant and not on its other buddies. And
if they don’t, the giant has just removed a whole PC from consideration for the
next round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athas is prime giant country and plenty of core giants would be happy as clams
living here, but I guess it makes sense to have some setting-specific ones to
signal that we’re not in Kansas any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beast giants and titans feel a bit redundant, but their appearance is certainly
striking. Shadow Giants have intriguing mechanics, but you probably don’t want
to have more than one of these in play at any given encounter. They can also be
used in other settings without a lot of modification, as “undead giant with a
grudge” is a pretty universal concept.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Ghost, Raaig</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-ghost-raaig.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athas is a world with plenty of horrible death in it, so of course it has plenty
of ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ghosts we’re talking about in this entry are also called “raaigs”, so you
can use that word when nomenclature is important and you want to distinguish
them from wraiths, specters, or the specific D&amp;amp;D monster actually called a
Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are specifically the ghosts of priests and holy warriors that served the
now-dead gods of Athas, and who met their demise while charged with protecting
their holy sites and relics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical encounter with a raaig will happen when the PCs enter the ruins of
such a place. The ghost, still fulfilling its mission, will manifest and
challenge the intruders to check whether they’re devout pilgrims or dastardly
thieves. Since no one alive remembers the proper prayers and passwords to
appease these spirits, they are likely to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raaigs have the full ghost package: ground and flight speeds of 6, Darkvision,
phasing, insubstantial, immune to disease and poison. The book mentions they
become corporeal for a moment when they attack, but this moment doesn’t last
long enough to influence their stat blocks, which considers them to be
insubstantial at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t have any weaknesses that let them become partially corporeal
either, so the only way to deal full damage to a raaig is if you’re using the
rules update that makes force damage fully affect all insubstantial creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raaig-tomb-spirit&quot;&gt;Raaig Tomb Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your common specimen as far as these very specific ghosts go. The Tomb Spirit is
a Level 9 Soldier with 66 HP, which looks like a small number until you remember
it will be taking half damage from everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tomb spirit projects an aura (1) of &lt;strong&gt;Gripping Dread&lt;/strong&gt;, which forbids
enemies inside from shifting and deals 5 cold damage to enemies marked by the
spirit who make an attack that doesn’t target it. This is a spooky version of
the Paladin’s mark mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its main attack is a &lt;strong&gt;chilling blade&lt;/strong&gt; that deals cold damage. As a minor
action once per round it can issue the &lt;strong&gt;Raaig’s Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets
Will, and pulls 2 squares and marks for a turn on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raaig-crypt-lord&quot;&gt;Raaig Crypt Lord&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A higher-ranking guardian in life, the Crypt Lord is a Level 14 Soldier with the
Leader tag and 96 HP. It’s mostly a Tomb Spirit with bigger numbers and improved
abilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;strong&gt;Chilling Blade&lt;/strong&gt; deals more damage and marks on a hit; its &lt;strong&gt;Gripping
Dread&lt;/strong&gt; has a radius of 2; ts &lt;strong&gt;Challenge&lt;/strong&gt; pulls 4 squares instead of 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one new ability here is &lt;strong&gt;Ghostly Command&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 6+) which lets each
undead ally within 5 squares of the lord shift 2 squares and make a basic
attack. As this takes a standard action, it will probably be used to open the
fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raaig-souflame&quot;&gt;Raaig Souflame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the ghost of someone who was so favored by the gods in life that they
retained a small spark of divine power after death. Their hold on this spark is
tenuous, however, and it might leave them if they’re too damaged. In this case,
they will be turned into desperate beasts full of grief and rage. This is a
Level 21 Skirmisher with 138 HP and all raaig traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that they lose the divine spark when bloodied, and so they
effectively have two sets of abilities and movement speeds - one for when they
have the spark, and one for when they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When “healthy”, the soulflame has a ground speed of 8 and a teleport speed
of 3. It attacks with a &lt;strong&gt;Divine Blade&lt;/strong&gt; that deals a mix of untyped and radiant
damage and lets the ghost teleport 3 squares on a hit. It can get fancy with
this and use it to perform a &lt;strong&gt;Flickering Phantom&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver (recharge 5+): the
souflame teleports 4 squares, makes a stronger than usual sword attack, then
teleports another 4 squares and makes another, weaker attack. The teleports are
effects, so they happen even if the attacks miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When bloodied, it loses the ability to teleport and gains a flight speed of 8
instead. Its main attack becomes a &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Blade&lt;/strong&gt; whose added damage is
necrotic instead of radiant, and which makes the target only regain half HP from
healing for a turn. Its Flickering Phantom ability is replaced with &lt;strong&gt;Hollow
Rage&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter power that deals heavy damage and prevents the target from
regaining HP entirely (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book says raaigs are intelligent and strong-willed enough to take command of
most other undead that haunt their temples, such as skeletons, mummies, and
other ghosts, so these will make up their allies in an encounter. It also
reminds us that not all gods were good - protectors of evil temples might still
have command of the devils or demons that also served its patron god. Souflames
in particular are likely to attract surviving angels that served the same deity,
as they are drawn to that faint spark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me think that a non-hostile raaig makes an excellent mentor and
teached for the super-rare divine PCs of Athas. Maybe your cleric or paladin was
trained by the soulflame who is the Last Priest of Pelor and who was aware
enough to take the PC under their wing instead of treating them as an intruder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if angels and devils arrive to serve such ghosts, that’d be a big draw to
someone who is researching a way into the Astral Sea, as I think that plane is
not normally accessible from Athas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ultra-Tech Dungeon Delving in GURPS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started writing this post a few years ago when I was GMing the Iron Gods
adventure path for Pathfinder using the Dungeon Fantasy RPG rules. My approach
to that campaign was pretty slap-dash, and after I stopped I began thinking of a
more structured way to do it. Since a recent comment here on the blog asked for
specifics, I though I’d dust the post off and publish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have a Dungeon Fantasy game where you want your characters to get
into contact with more advanced technology. How would you go about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ultra-tech-delving-a-survey&quot;&gt;Ultra-Tech Delving: A Survey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jackson games did a little foray into this area in Pyramid #3/60, in an
article entitled “High-Tech Dungeon Crawl”, which focused on bringing modern-day
characters with guns into fantasy dungeons to mow down orcs with autofire and
take their stuff. This raises the inherent level of colonalism in the genre from
“concerning” to “yikes!”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to focus on here is in an older variation on the theme: fantasy
characters exploring “dungeons” filled with elements you might be more used to
seeing in science fiction stories. When I say “older”, I mean it’s &lt;em&gt;older than
D&amp;amp;D&lt;/em&gt;: Dave Arneson’s Blackmoor campaign featured a whole ultra-tech city-state
descended from the crew of a crashed spaceship, and it was played for several
years before what became the OD&amp;amp;D rules were finalized and officially
published. D&amp;amp;D proper would explore the same territory with its famous
“Expedition to the Barrier Peaks” module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathfinder dedicates a whole kingdom in its setting to the idea: the land of
Numeria is a barbarian kingdom where a giant spaceship crashed millenia ago,
breaking up during atmospheric entry and scattering its many modules all over
the region. And, of course, in Gamma World and other post-apocalyptic games
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; “dungeons” are ultra-tech because they’re the ruins of the futuristic
civilization that preceded the apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ultra-tech-delving-in-gurps&quot;&gt;Ultra-Tech Delving in GURPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GURPS is of course a uniquely well-suited system for this kind of thing. Its
rules already support a wide range of genres and technology levels from the
corebook onwards. We only need a few adjustments depending on the sort of
campaign we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After The End&lt;/em&gt; already deals with the post-apocalyptic angle and offers a set
of detailed rules. What I want, however, is something simpler and more suited to
a Barrier Peaks/Numeria scenario. The ultra-tech stuff is alien, but characters
can gain an understanding of it with some investment, and the gap between their
usual medievalish milieu and the lofty heights of alien tech isn’t completely
impossible to cross. How would I do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tech-level-or-the-lack-thereof&quot;&gt;Tech Level, or the Lack Thereof.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on one side we have the usual “medievalish” dungeon fantasy setting. In
GURPS, that’s roughtly TL 4, but without gunpowder. On the other side we have a
space-opera intrusion, which corresponds very roughly to a TL9-10 selection with
a few outliers (personal shields are TL11-12, but they fit the flavor). With
these vague numbers in mind, we can ditch the concept of Tech Levels completely
for our treatment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Default GURPS Tech Level rules are only useful for giving us a starting set of
gadgets to work with. In actual play, the only thing that matters is if a given
thing is “low-tech” and thus familiar to everyone, or “high-tech” and thus a
mystery to the uninitiated. How to differentiate both? With the following
advantage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tech-familiarity-10-points&quot;&gt;Tech Familiarity (10 points)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a layman’s knowledge of the basic principles behind the advanced
technology scattered through your otherwise medieval fantasy world. You
understand why it isn’t magic. You know about electricity and how it powers
high-tech devices. You grasp enough of the high-tech design aesthetic to easily
spot a device’s charging port or battery, its control surfaces (be they
switches, triggers, or touchpads), its information displays, and its business
end even if you don’t know what the thing actually &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;. You can identify the
high-tech civilization’s writing even though you can’t read it, and you can
identify its iconography for “danger”. You can also recognize hazards like
exposed live wires, recognize which type of power cell goes into a device, and
plug it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a form of Unusual Background that makes you immune to the sort of
amusing accident which plagues other low-tech explorers confronted with
high-tech devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, Tech Familiarity is a pre-requisite for learning high-tech
skills, and the language of the high-tech civilization (if any). With this
advantage, you can spend points on those things normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is quite similar to High TL from the core book, but much cheaper. The
reason is that paying 30-35 points in High TL to get the same benefits is way
too expensive for a campaign in this mold. This advantage doesn’t give you any
familiarity with deeper aspects of the high-tech civilization, just what’s in
the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tech-skills&quot;&gt;Tech Skills&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills that would require a /TL specialization in standard GURPS rules have only
two versions here: standard (no suffix) and “/Tech”. That way, you don’t need to
change anything about how you write down a standard “medievalish” character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two specialties don’t overlap at all: they don’t default to each other, and
can’t be used at all across the “tech divide”. If you only have standard
Lockpicking, you can’t open a high-tech door with a magnetic lock. If you only
have Lockpicking/Tech, you can’t open low-tech mechanical locks with
old-fashioned picks, tough you might be able to operate a machine that does it
for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-tech weapons are usually firearms of beam weapons - the skills to operate
them properly are always “/Tech” skills. High-Tech &lt;em&gt;melee&lt;/em&gt; weapons are a
possible exception to the “no defaults” rule above, though the GM would need to
rule on each case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons that use the same skill as their low-tech counterparts can be used
normally by anyone if the only difference is in their construction (such as a
superfine or hyperdense blade). If they have some additional feature that
requires power (such as a vibroblade or shock baton) then the character has a -2
penalty to use that feature unless they have Tech Familiarity. If they require
an exclusive skill to operate (like a force sword or monowire whip) then that
skill has the “/Tech” suffix. You might be able to get away with a default to a
low-tech skill here, but the only way to improve on that is to buy Tech
Familiarity and the high-tech skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ultra-tech-gear&quot;&gt;Ultra-Tech Gear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the character stuff out of the way, we can talk about the goodies! As I
mentioned above, one advantage of GURPS is that it has entire books of high- and
ultra-tech gadgets that can be plugged straight into your fantasy
campaigns. Therefore, we don’t need to talk about how to stat this stuff up at
all! What we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need is talk about the effects it’s going to have on your
campaign, which in turn will aid you in selecting which items to include.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-much-is-this-stuff-worth&quot;&gt;How much is this stuff worth?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vital question in the dungeon fantasy genre! Going more or less by the book,
high-tech items should be worth roughly 30 times their list price in a dungeon
fantasy setting. That makes even a relatively innocuous gadget into a major
piece of loot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem a bit too much for a dungeon fantasy setting where magic and
magic items are relatively common, but I think it kinda makes sense. Ultra-tech
items are going to be a lot rarer than magic items, particularly in settings
where they come from that single crashed spaceship. They work regardless of the
local mana and sanctitiy levels. And they can be enchanted! These are exactly
the same reasons why a suit of fine plate armor costs more than a standard suit
enchanted with Lighten 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: A superfine broadword would cost $3600 in its native ultra-tech
society. Recovered from a crashed spaceship in a dungeon fantasy setting, it’s
worth $108,000!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sword gives a +2 bonus to damage and a (2) armor divisor. The closest
“low-tech” equivalent would be a very fine sword with a Penetrating Weapon
enchantment, worth $17,000, almost ten times cheaper. Even if all the bonuses
were from magic, it would still cost only $25,600. However, the superfine blade
will lose none of its functionality in a low- or no-mana zone, and it could be
enchanted with the same magic as the low-tech sword to become even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think that this is too much, you could say that the value of
ultra-tech gear is capped by the value of magic items with similar
properties. The sword from the example would be worth $17,000 then. Gear that
has no magical equivalent might still use the “uncapped” price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;timeworn-gear&quot;&gt;Timeworn Gear&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One concept from Pathfinder that’s useful to borrow is that of timeworn
items. In Barrier Peaks-style setups, most of the high-tech stuff the PCs come
across has been sitting around in derelict ruins for a very long time; even if
it was very well-built, it might not have withstood the passage of the ages
intact. To model that, we introduce the following equipment modifier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeworn&lt;/strong&gt;: This can be applied to any high-tech armor, weapon, or device that
requires power or ammunition to function. These items can’t be recharged. After
whatever reserves they contain when found are used up, they’ll break down and
become useless. They may also have other quirks arising from their almost-broken
state at the GM’s discretion. Divide final price by 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weapons-and-armor&quot;&gt;Weapons and Armor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons and armor deserve special mention because Dungeon Fantasy is a
combat-heavy genre, and this combat has a very specific “feel” to it. Therefore,
high-tech combat gear will have an outsize impact on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baseline Dungeon Fantasy suggests that PCs should have a maximum total DR of
about 15, as anything more than that will make them invulnerable to too many
monster attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PC damage also has some upper bounds. Spellcasters with missile spells and a
spellcasting talent of 6 can do a maximum of 18d damage, though that requires
enough setup to only be possible about once per fight, and not on all
fights. The maximum amount of “at-will” melee and ranged damage a PC can do is
equivalent to about 7d per attack&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing ultra-tech armor into the game almost certainly means you’re going
to exceed the DR cap. Even non-combat safety gear at these tech levels has as
much DR as low-tech plate, while being much lighter. Proper combat armor is much
tougher. Most of the published DF enemies will have trouble getting past the DR
of a PC in full ultra-tech armor with their physical attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, high-tech weapons can change the shape of combat in your
campaign. Dungeon Fantasy usually considers melee to be the main event and
ranged combat to be a specialist niche, but if guns and beam weapons are common
these two are going to swap places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultra-tech melee and ranged weapons can also allow PCs to approach or exceed the
upper damage bounds described above much more easily. Both “boundaries” are
roughly equivalent to rolling 7d of damage per attack. A force sword does 8d; a
laser rifle does 6d, and can can fire many more shots per turn than a bow with
no penalty. Both of those have armor divisors too, which make enemy DR become
much less of an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step when addressing these issues is to carefully consider which items
are available. What do you want your campaign’s new DR cap to be? What is the
highest armor divisor you’re comfortable with? What sort of maximum damage do
you want your PCs to do with a melee or ranged attack they can use every second?
And, to quote Mister Torgue from Borderlands 2: EXPLOSIONS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second step is to consider the same thing from the side of the opposition:
what’s the highest DR and damage you estimate &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; will be able to routunely
bring to the table? The gear available to the PCs should give them a chance to
match those figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then safely remove anything that exceeds your new planned limits. That
will end up giving you a pretty good set of guidelines for what the ultra-tech
culture and their ruins look like. A civilian medical lab infested with
non-sapient monsters and low-tech looters might have plenty of medkits and
wonder drugs, but no weapon heavier than a couple of timeworn electrolasers and
some scalpels the thief can use as superfine daggers. For a military base filled
with killer robots and with a tank at the end as a boss fight, the sky is the
limit, though those anti-tank weapons might all be timeworn if you don’t want
the PCs using them outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The article itself includes a section titled “The Sociological
Ramifications are Appalling”. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A ST 20 Knight with Weapon Master and a halberd can easily attack twice
every turn and do 3d+13 per attack. This is theoretically possible right out
of character creation if your knight is a half-ogre. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A ST 20 Scout with Weapon Master and Strongbow might be able to shoot once
per turn and do about 4d+10 per shot. This particular boundary is hard to
reach, so your highest “at-will” ranged damage will probably be less than
that. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book opens this entry by that the wastelands of Athas “sometimes spawn
monsters so terrible not even the merciful can permit them to live”. Cheery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illustration makes me think a gaj is what you get when you mix a mind flayer
with a beetle. These aberrations have human-level intelligence, strong
telepathic powers, and a taste for the flesh and fear of sapient
creatures. They’re too anti-social to practice infiltration like mind flayers
sometimes do, but there’s still a lot about them that’s familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaj dwell in extensive burrow networks that technically form a community, but
they rarely interact with each other. They’ll band together to defend their
home, but they mostly hunt alone or in mated pairs. They attack their prey with
their claws and mandibles, and with invasive telepathy focused through their
feathery antennae. Once a gaj has a firm grip on a victim, the touch of those
antennae will rapidly disassemble the creature’s mind and use it to fuel further
psychic assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain specimens mutate to assume a sort of leadership role in a gaj
community. Their powers specialize on inflicting pain, and they take upon
themselves the job of keeping victims captive in the burrow as dominated slaves
and/or reserve rations for lean times. These Pain Tyrants are one of the few
things that can get a whole burrow together for a bigger hunt or a raid against
a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; lean times, when gaj cannot find new victims and have already
devoured all of their captives, they’ll turn on each other - even their own
mates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, just as gaj like to hunt other sapients, so are they hunted in
return. They’re very popular in the arena, so those ubuquitous slavers often
mount expeditions to find and capture them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaj are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts with a ground speed of 6, a burrow speed
of 3, Darkvision, and Tremorsense 5. Their signature trait is &lt;strong&gt;Warding Shell&lt;/strong&gt;,
which gives them +2 to defenses against any creature marking them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the stat blocks here are Chaotic Evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gaj-mindhunter&quot;&gt;Gaj Mindhunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the typical specimen, so named to distinguish it from the Pain
Tyrant. Mindhunters are Level 8 Elite Controllers with 172 HP. Their basic
attack is a bite with their &lt;strong&gt;Mandibles&lt;/strong&gt;, which grab on a hit. Once the
mindhunter has a victim in its jaws, it can only use this attack against it, and
not against others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;strong&gt;Invasive Presence&lt;/strong&gt; has no such restrictions. It’s targets one or two
creatures within Range 10, deals psychic damage on a hit, and pushes 1
square. There’s also &lt;strong&gt;Mind Wrench&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), which targets a creature
within a Close Burst 3 and dominates on a hit (save ends). Each time the target
fails the save, the mindhunter’s grabbed victim takes 2d6 psychic damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, once per round, the mindhunter can use its &lt;strong&gt;Feathery Probe&lt;/strong&gt;
on the grabbed victim. On a hit this deals light psychic damage, 5 ongoing
psychic damage, and dazes (save ends). If the target is already taking ongoing
psychic damage, that damage increases by 5. Yes, repeated hits with this attack
will result in more and more ongoing damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this paints us a picture of the mindhunter’s preferred tactics: choose a
victim to bite and grab, get away from the PCs, and keep using Invasive Presence
and Mind Wrench to keep them busy while they nom on the victim with Feathery
Probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gaj-pain-tyrant&quot;&gt;Gaj Pain Tyrant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pain Tyrants are considerably stronger than mindhunters, being Level 13 Elite
Artillery with the Leader tag and 200 HP. Its &lt;strong&gt;Mandibles&lt;/strong&gt; have no special
effects other than damage. Its ranged basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Shriek&lt;/strong&gt; with
range 20, that targets 1-2 creatures, and on a hit deals psychic damage and
dazes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less often they can use &lt;strong&gt;Agonizing Insight&lt;/strong&gt;, an Area Burst 2 Within 20 with a
lot of complicated effects. This weaponized anxiety attack inflicts 20 psychic
damage on a hit (save ends). Whenever the target takes this ongoing damage, each
of its allies within 3 squares also takes 5 psychic damage. So, if it hits 3
PCs, in the next round each of them is going to take a total of 30 psychic
damage if they stay together: 20 from the main effect, 10 from splash damage. It
recharges when the tyrant scores a critical hit with Phrenic Probe (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt; the attack also makes each enemy inside the burst grant combat
advantage for a turn even if they weren’t hit by the main attack. It also lets
allies in the burst use a free action to either shift 1 square or move half
their speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against a dazed target, the Pain Tyrant can use &lt;strong&gt;Phrenic Probe&lt;/strong&gt; as a 1/round
minor action. This is a version of the mindhunter’s Feathery Probe that has
range 20! Finally, &lt;strong&gt;Vicious Goad&lt;/strong&gt; lets an ally within 20 squares move its
speed and make a basic attack against an enemy of the tyrant’s choice as a free
action. The ally is then dazed for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the most common gaj encounter in the wilderness is a pair of
mindhunters. A Pain Tyrant leading a larger group is also possible, but in this
case I’d recommend making the accompanying mindhunters into regulars of a
slightly lower level than their boss. Enslaved humanoids can round out the
group. And you can also find mindhunters being used as arena fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These seem to be very tricky to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    An red floating mantle.
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Silt Sea makes up the eastern border of the known regions of Athas. No one
knows what’s on the other side of it, and they have only the barest idea of
what’s under the dust. Sometimes, weird creatures will drift in from those
far and deep regions. One of these weirdoes is the floating mantle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floating mantles are giant flying jellyfish, though no one in Athas calls them
that because they don’t know what a fish is. Despite their strong psionic
powers, their flight is entirely mundane. Their bodies secrete a lighter than
air gas into internal cavities to keep them aloft, and they expel small
quantities of this gas to propel themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures live in small groups called colonies, which are psychically
linked to form a collective consciousness. They have some fairly obvious sexual
dimorphism: males are a pale red in color, while females are a pale yellow. Both
grow much more vivid in coloration when they feel agitated or threatened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During their reproductive cycle, the female will carry a large litter of
“polyps” to term. This causes her to become larger, bluish in color and much
more irritable, as the pregnancy is highly uncomfortable for her. When in this
state, she’s known as a “bluesting”. When threatened, a bluesting might
prematurely release some of its polyps, which can fight ferociously but don’t
last long. Even when they’re properly birthed at the right time, polyps are
still fragile and only a small fraction of them will grow up to join the colony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book describes floating mantles as “quiet and inoffensive”, which I guess
means they only attack sapients if they feel threatened, or to defend their
young. They probably feed on small animals, and mainly hunt on the Silt
Sea. When they do fight, they use the same natural weapons they use for hunting:
sting-covered tendrils that deliver a paralytic poison, and the ability to drain
the life force of a helpless victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hurt, a floating mantle emits a psychic scream that stuns attackers and
warns their fellows of danger. Finally, the gas that they use is probably
hydrogen, because it gives them an unfortunate tendency to explode when exposed
to fire or electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floating Mantles are Aberrant Magical Beasts with the Blind tag, which makes
them immune to blinding effects and gaze attacks. They perceive their
surroundings with Blindsight 20. Mantles have a flight speed of 6, with an
altitude limit of 3 and the ability to hover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adult mantles are vulnerable 10 to fire and lightning. Polyps have too little
stored hydrogen for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flying mantles are also immune to the effects of their Psychic Scream powers,
whether used by themselves or by another mantle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;floating-mantle&quot;&gt;Floating Mantle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This typical specimen is Small in size, and a Level 13 Controller with 126
HP. Its basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Tentacle Rake&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 2 vs. reflex) that deals
poison damage and slows for a turn. If they have combat advantage against a
target, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Life Leech&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 2 vs. Fortitude) as a minor
action. This deals poison damage, dazes and immobilizes (save ends both) and
gives 10 temporary HP to the mantle. Of course, a target who’s hit by this once
becomes susceptible to it until they save against that daze, since dazed
characters grant CA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also as a minor action, the mantle can squeeze out a &lt;strong&gt;Jet&lt;/strong&gt; to shift its
speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the mantle is first bloodied, a lot of stuff happens. First, &lt;strong&gt;Jet&lt;/strong&gt;
recharges. Then it lets out a &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/strong&gt;! The scream is a free action
attack vs. Will in a Close Burst 2. On a hit, it deals psychic damage, and makes
it so the affected targets take 10 psychic damage whenever they make an attack
against the creature (save ends). As an effect, the floating mantle becomes
invisible until the end of its next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the mantle is reduced to 0 HP by fire or lightning, it &lt;strong&gt;suddenly explodes&lt;/strong&gt;!
This is another Close Burst 2, vs. Reflex this time, dealing high fire damage
and pushing targets 1d4 squares. On a miss, it does half damage. This is
probably the only variable push I ever saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;floating-mantle-bluesting&quot;&gt;Floating Mantle Bluesting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bluestings grow to Medium size. They’re Level 15 Artillery with 111 HP, and a
greater blindsight range of 25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Tentacle Rake&lt;/strong&gt; Attack has reach 3 and does more damage than the common
mantle’s, and they also gain the ability to fling their tiny stingers at distant
targets. This &lt;strong&gt;Flinging Nettles&lt;/strong&gt; attack targets Fortitude and deals poison
damage out to range 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If enemies manage to get close, the bluesting can let out a &lt;strong&gt;Toxic Burst&lt;/strong&gt;,
which targets creatures in a Close Burst 1 and deals poison damage on a hit. If
the bluesting has less than four accompanying polyps, one appears in an adjacent
square, acting right after the bluesting in initiative order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have the same &lt;strong&gt;Jet&lt;/strong&gt; ability as the common specimen, and can also perform
a &lt;strong&gt;Sudden Birth&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+) as a minor when pressed. This is more or less
the same as the secondary effect of the Toxic Burst above: it puts a new polyp
in play within 3 squares if there are less than four accompanying the bluesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Sudden Explosion&lt;/strong&gt; work the same as in the common
specimen, but do more damage since bluestings are higher level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;floating-mantle-polyp&quot;&gt;Floating Mantle Polyp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Tiny youngsters can either be pre-placed in an encounter, or be produced
by bluestings (in which case they’re not worth XP). A previously-placed polyp is
one that reached term and was birthed normally, and adults will fiercely defend
it. One produced during combat is considered premature and will die a few
minutes after the fighting stops. Adults are less attached to those. In either
case it’s not yet hooked up to the hive mind and it’s recklessly hangry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polyps are Level 15 Minion Brutes. Their &lt;strong&gt;Tentacle Rakes&lt;/strong&gt; do poison damage,
and when they die they let loose a &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/strong&gt; in a close burst 2, which
deals psychic damage and dazes for a turn on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are likely the most peaceful and sympathetic aberrant creatures you’re
likely to find anywhere. They’ll most likely be found just chilling and minding
their business, and will only become dangerous if the PCs strike the first
blow. The capybaras of the Far Realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their lore is both disturbingly biological and a breath of fresh air. The first
part is obvious (poor premature polyps!), and the second one is because here we
have an example of powerful Athasian wildlife that &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; so mindlessly
aggressive it thinks armed adventurers are a good meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard flying mantles need to either appear in pairs or have some other
opportunistic flanking buddy that will help them get their initial combat
advantage on a target. Other than that all of them have some interesting ways to
punish PCs that do &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; well against them.&lt;/p&gt;

    An elf running through the desert.

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athasian elves are tall and long-legged, and their culture is almost entirely
nomadic. Elven communities roam the deserts of Athas accompanied by swift beasts
of burden and war, but none of those are mounts. An elf will only accept being
carried by a beast if they’re too sick or wounded to stand. Otherwise, they
prefer to run. And they’re very good at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike some of the other nomads we saw so far, such as brohgs, elves have
frequent interactions with Athasian settled peoples and city states. Their
overall reputation is not very good. They’re known as itinerant traders who
bring a lot of cool stuff to sell in the Elven Markets many towns have, but
they’re also known as swindlers, thieves, raiders, and occasionally
murderers. The cool stuff they sell you was probably stolen from someone else,
according to rumor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of reputation has a number of unplasant parallels with real-world
prejudices, so I find it off-putting that the book spends a lot of effort trying
to convince me it’s true. Even the PCs have “desert raider” and “market thief”
as their new custom background options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d prefer to portray elves as having a lot of solidarity for each other and not
a lot of sympathy for the outsiders who hate them so much. They drive hard
bargains at the Market and skip town en masse if it looks like someone’s going
to accuse one of them of a crime. The accusation is likely to be false most of
the time, as I interpret it. Some individuals might resemble the negative
stereotype, but then again that’s also true of city-dwellers, whose negative
stereotype is “servant to a slaving despot” or “slaver”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elves who are found guilty of crimes in their own communities are cast out, and
will often end up joining groups of actual raiders and bandits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their taller build elves remain Medium Fey Humanoids with a ground speed
of 7. The stat blocks here &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have low-light vision, though I think that’s
still a feature of PC elves. They do all have &lt;strong&gt;Wild Step&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Elven
Accuracy&lt;/strong&gt;, which work like their PC versions too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level range here is roughly comparable to that of standard elves from other
books, so you can mix-and-match a bit. All of the stat blocks here are Unaligned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elf-peddler&quot;&gt;Elf Peddler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical denizen of the Elven Markets. This could both represent a more or less
honest trader who knows how to defend themselves, or a cutthroat who looks for
particularly vulnerable customers to ambush after a sale. It’s a Level 2
Skirmisher with the Leader tag and 34 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical peddler’s goal in a fight will be to live to fight another day, so
they always hang around places with convenient escape routes and obstacles that
might deter pursuers, such as twisty alleys or clustered stalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The peddler is armed with a &lt;strong&gt;bone longsword&lt;/strong&gt;, which does standard damage for
its level. It can use the &lt;strong&gt;Double Dealing&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver at will: this lets it make
a sword attack, shift half their speed, and then make another sword attack
against a different target if they end the shift flanking that target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action they can also use &lt;strong&gt;Peddler’s Command&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets an ally
within 20 squares move half their speed as a free action. If that ally is
another elf, the move is instead a shift. This is useful to set up the flank for
that second Double Dealing attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elf-sniper&quot;&gt;Elf Sniper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another typical denizen of the markets, Snipers work security from shadowy
corners and rooftop perches. If trouble starts, they help cover their allies’
retreat with their thrown weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snipers are Level 3 Minion Lurkers armed with &lt;strong&gt;Bone Daggers&lt;/strong&gt; and a brace of 10
&lt;strong&gt;Chatkchas&lt;/strong&gt;, which are three-pronged sharpened boomerangs. Both of these
attacks deal a bit of extra damage if the sniper is hidden from the target when
they start the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an at-will Move action, the sniper can use &lt;strong&gt;Elven Misdirection&lt;/strong&gt; to move 2
squares and make a free Stealth check to become hidden if they end the movement
with cover or concealment. This check has an automatic result of 25, which means
they “take 15” on the roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combat, they’ll try to pop out from cover, make a ranged attack, and hide
again. If someone tries to get close to them they will run. Like the peddler,
their goal in a “market fight” situation is to delay and distract pursuers
enough for their allies to flee, and then flee themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elf-dune-strider&quot;&gt;Elf Dune Strider&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This nomadic warrior is used to running through the wastes. This stat block can
represent a raider, or someone who’s just protecting their wandering band. It’s
a Level 4 Skirmisher with 52 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dune Strider can &lt;strong&gt;Move Like the Wind&lt;/strong&gt;, gaining +5 to all defenses against
opportunity attacks provoked by movement. They’re armed with a &lt;strong&gt;Bone
Longsword&lt;/strong&gt; that does extra damage on a charge, and a &lt;strong&gt;Obsidian Shortsword&lt;/strong&gt;
that’s slightly better for static attacks. The &lt;strong&gt;Rushing Dervish&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver lets
them move their Speed + 2 and make one attack with each sword against a
different target during the movement. This recharges when they’re bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striders acting as raiders will keep mobile and try to spread out their attacks
in an attempt to intimidate their targets into giving up their possessions. They
will flee if the fight turns against them. Their traits and abilities make it
easy for them to bounce around the battlefield like pinballs, making charge
attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elf-raid-leader&quot;&gt;Elf Raid Leader&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sort of veteran commander you might find leading a larger raid against a
settlement, either as revenge for mistreatment or as a plain old resource
grab. It’s level 6 Artillery with the Leader tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leader has a &lt;strong&gt;obsidian shortsword&lt;/strong&gt; for emergencies, whose strikes let it
shift 1 square on a hit. It will mostly fight with its &lt;strong&gt;Bone Bow&lt;/strong&gt;, which is
both more accurate and more damaging. It can fire &lt;strong&gt;Harrying Shots&lt;/strong&gt; that do the
same damage as a basic ranged attack, but also make the target grant combat
advantage to adjacent allies of the leader for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its leaderly action is a command to &lt;strong&gt;Focus on the Pain&lt;/strong&gt; (minor action,
recharge 6+) which deals 5 damage to an ally within 20 squares and allows that
ally to immediately roll a save with a +2 bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raid leaders obviously lead from the back, providing ranged support to their
skirmisher and lurker allies. It might be good to add a brute or soldier war
beast to help protect them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already mentioned my opinion about the elven stereotypes here: I don’t like
them, and would probably change them a bit were I to run a campaign in this
setting. They would be less true than depicted in the book, and depending on the
tone I was going for might or might not be less prevalent in the setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stat blocks are good, and can make for an extremely mobile encounter group
when used together. As mentioned above, any brutes and soldiers who are part of
an all-elven group will likely be trained war beasts instead of more elves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physically, Athasian eladrin are very similar to those of the core setting, but
the near-total loss of their home plane has done a number on their psychology
and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defiling magic didn’t just destroy Athasian ecosystems - they also dissolved its
Feywild. Now only a few rare pocket dimensions remain, scattered like oases
through the wastes. The fate of the Lands Within the Wind is still tied to that
of Athas, which means they’re slowly dying just like the world is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Athasian Eladrin are a traumatized and dying people. Most of the ones
that remain live in remote castles and settlements in the desert or inside
surviving pockets of Feywild, guarding the entrance to their realms with psychic
illusions and only venturing out when they must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eladrin have the same common stats as always: they’re Medium Fey Humanoids with
a Speed of 6, Low-light vision and a +5 on saves vs. charm effects. They retain
their signature &lt;strong&gt;Fey Step&lt;/strong&gt; power, which lets them teleport 5 squares as a move
action once per encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stat blocks occupies what would be the lower range of eladrin power levels
from the Monster Manuals and Monster Vault. There are no more epic-level ghaeles
and bralanis in Athas… probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eladrin-veiled-warriors&quot;&gt;Eladrin Veiled Warriors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veiled Warriors are spies and scouts that range far away from Eladrin
settlements to gather information and locate resources, thought hey can also be
found as part of their homes’ defense force. This is a great origin for PCs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NPC Veiled Warriors are Level 5 Soldiers with 60 HP. They fight with
Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;Longspears&lt;/strong&gt; that damage and mark for a turn on a hit. Once per
encounter they can use a &lt;strong&gt;Veiling Dart&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5 vs. Will) which deals
psychic damage, blinds for a turn and slows (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eladrin-mirage-adept&quot;&gt;Eladrin Mirage Adept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the psions responsible for hiding Eladrin settlements. They’re Level 7
Controllers with 80 HP and a focus on illusion powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic melee attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Dagger&lt;/strong&gt; that deals psychic damage and slows for
a turn. They can attack at range with &lt;strong&gt;Deluding Whispers&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10
vs. Will), a charm power that deals psychic damage, slides 3 squares and
prevents the target from seeing creatures not adjacent to it for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally they’ll strike with the &lt;strong&gt;Phantom Foes&lt;/strong&gt; power (recharge 6, area 2
within 20 vs. Will), which I guess projects the illusion that many additional
foes are attacking the targets. This “psychic fireball” deals psychic damage and
confuses (save ends). Confused characters roll a d20 whenever they’re about to
make a melee or ranged attack and an ally is also in reach of that attack. On a
10 or higher, they attack the ally instead of the intended target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirage adepts are very effective when combined with veiled warriors, because the
warriors use reach weapons and so don’t need to be adjacent to a target blinded
by Deluding Whispers in order to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eladrin-windwalker&quot;&gt;Eladrin Windwalker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some eladrin indiscriminately blame all people of the natural world for the fate
of their homeland, and feel such overwhelming hatred towards them that they
offer themselves in ritual sacrifice. This causes their life essence to slowly
leak into the Feywild and be replaced with the raw magic of that plane. This
gives them great power for as long as their diminishing life lasts. They use
their remaining time to go out into the world and slay every humanoid they see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windwalkers are Level 8 Lurkers with 69 HP. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;sabers&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;blowguns&lt;/strong&gt; that ignore armor and target Reflex. Their damage is average, but
&lt;strong&gt;Unseen Advantage&lt;/strong&gt; lets the windwalker deal extra damage against targets that
can’t see it, and slow them for a turn on any hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Between the Winds&lt;/strong&gt; trait lets a windwalker become invisible and gain
phasing whenever it either spends a turn without attacking or uses its &lt;em&gt;fey
step&lt;/em&gt;. These conditions last for a turn or until the windwalker attacks. This
does mean they can stay continuously invisible if they don’t attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windwalkers will usually try to attack every other turn like most lurkers to
benefit from Unseen Advantage, but the presence of an ally who can make them
invisible or blind PCs (like a Mirage Adept) can let them strike every turn with
bonus damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eladrin-windwalker-mirage&quot;&gt;Eladrin Windwalker Mirage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windwalkers in the final stages of the process are little more than ghosts. They
become Level 8 Minion Lurkers with a ground speed of &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt;, a flight speed of 6
(hover, altitude limit 2), always-on phasing, and Resist 10 All. Despite
appearances they are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; undead, and are not especially vulnerable to radiant
damage and anti-undead powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Wisp on the Wind&lt;/strong&gt; trait gives them partial concealment vs. enemies that
are 2 or 3 squares away, and total concealment against enemies 4 or more squares
away. Their melee attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Razor Wind&lt;/strong&gt; that does minion-tier damage. When
they hit 0 HP, their &lt;strong&gt;Dispersing Essence&lt;/strong&gt; attacks a Close Burst 3 and does the
same damage as Razor Wind to those it hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mirage’s damage resistance means you can only get it to that point by
dealing 11 or more damage with a single attack - they’ll resist anything
weaker. On the bright side, this means Dispersing Essence cannot provoke a chain
reaction as it only deals 8 damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirages love large battle maps that let them invisibly fly past the party’s
defenders and gang up on isolated squishies. PCs can counter this tactic by
sticking together, but Dispersing Essence makes that decision a bit tougher than
it would seem at first. Cruel GMs can make it even harder by including other
monsters capable of area attacks in the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Windwalker variants are evil, having succumbed to genocidal rage, but
everyone else is unaligned. And they’re all super tragic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think windwalkers would mix with other eladrin, though it’s easy
enough to reskin a standard Mirage Adept as another windwalker variant if you
want to mix them up. As noted above, this makes for a potent combination.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A dune reaper. This image is mirrored from the one in the book.
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of other Athasian fauna, dune reapers are predatory
insectile/reptilian pack hunters. However, they lean a lot more towards the
“insectile” side, and their origins are clearly unnatural even to contemporary
inhabitants of Athas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book says they “came to existence through defiling magic”, though it doesn’t
specify whether they were an artificially engineered species or whether some
side effect of defiling brought them to the world. Their Aberrant origin kinda
hints at the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures have a complex social structure. They organize into large
familial groups known as prides, who build large hives from sand, rocks, and
organic secretions near a water source that becomes the center of their
territory. The pride then splits up into smaller packs, which roam that
territory looking for food. A pack is composed of a large female “warrior”,
accompanied by smaller male “drones” and “shrieks” who are her mates. The
pride’s dominant female is known as its “matron”, and it’s her who makes
decisions that affect the whole pack, like where to build the hive or when to
seek new territory. A matron rules the pride until her death, which is usually
in a duel with an up-and-coming warrior who challenges her for the position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dune reapers are a scourge on the local ecology. Their menu includes just about
everything they can reach: humanoids, animals, plants, wagons, buildings… they
even eat rocks to store in their gizzards and aid in the digestion of tougher
food. A humanoid settlement in dune reaper territory is only safe if they can
provide the creatures with an ample alternate source of food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dune reaper reproduction happens on an annual cycle, and they’re even more
dangerous during mating season. The pride’s females need to lay their eggs
inside the bodies of living creatures, you see. When the eggs hatch, the newborn
reapers eat their host, and then set upon each other. Only the strongest
hatchlings survive this process. After about two months they’re already as
dangerous as a fully grown adult. At this time, they’re driven from their birth
hive and must either join another pride or form a new one with other young
reapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dune Reapers are Aberrant Beasts with Darkvision. Their basic melee attack
always uses their &lt;strong&gt;Arm Blades&lt;/strong&gt;, which do standard damage for their level and
might have other effects depending on the stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dune-reaper-drone&quot;&gt;Dune Reaper Drone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These relatively small males are Medium and make up the dune reaper worker
caste. They build the hive and carry food back to it, but as Level 12
Skirmishers with 120 HP and Speed 8 they’re certainly strong enough to take part
in the hunt as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic &lt;strong&gt;arm blade&lt;/strong&gt; attack also lets them shift 1 square on a hit. They
can perform a &lt;strong&gt;Leaping Slash&lt;/strong&gt; that lets them jump 4 squares without provoking
opportunity attacks and use Arm Blade at the end of the movement. This recharges
when they’re first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an enemy grants Combat Advantage to the drone, it can use a minor action to
&lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;, dealing light physical damage on a hit. If an enemy makes a melee
attack against the drone, it can &lt;strong&gt;Leap Away&lt;/strong&gt;, jumping 4 squares without
drawing OAs, as an immediate reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drones want to leap into melee at the start of the fight, and seek positions
where their chosen target grants them CA. They’ll leap away when attacked and
come back from an unexpected angle. When fighting drones, shoot them or surround
them. Don’t let them surround you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dune-reaper-shriek&quot;&gt;Dune Reaper Shriek&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not a role you usuall find among mundane insects. The book considers them
specialized drones that can leap not just through the air, but through time and
space. When they do this, they emit an ear-splitting scream that gives them
their name. They’re Level 14 Lurkers with 106 HP and Speed 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;arm blades&lt;/strong&gt; are standard attacks with no riders, and are a lot more
dangerous when used in conjunction with the shriek’s freaky powers. A
&lt;strong&gt;Shrieking Reap&lt;/strong&gt; lets them make two arm blade attacks against the same
target. If one hits, it teleports the target 2 squares and inflicts 10 ongoing
damage (save ends). If both hit, the teleport distance increases to 5, and the
ongoing damage to 15. A &lt;strong&gt;Shrieking Warp&lt;/strong&gt; removes the shriek from play until
the start of its next turn, when it appears at a spot within 10 squares of its
previous position and makes a Close Burst 2 attack that deals thunder damage and
pushes 2 squares on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shrieking Warp is an at-will ability, but it’s disabled for a turn when the
shriek takes force damage because of its &lt;strong&gt;Forceful Silence&lt;/strong&gt; trait. Shrieking
Reap recharges whenever the creature uses Shrieking Warp. Our lurker loop here
is Shrieking Reap -&amp;gt; Shrieking Warp -&amp;gt; Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book reminds us that forced movement is always voluntary for the attacker,
so shrieks arriving from a Warp will often choose to push all but one of the
enemies they hit with the attack, to isolate it from its allies. Clever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dune-reaper-warrior&quot;&gt;Dune Reaper Warrior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Large female will lead a pack of drones and shrieks when hunting. She’s a
Level 15 Brute with 180 HP, Speed 7, and the Leader tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She exudes an aura (3) of &lt;strong&gt;Inciting Pheromones&lt;/strong&gt; that grants all dune reapers
inside a +2 bonus to Will, and makes them immune to the Dazed condition. She
also has the &lt;strong&gt;Unhindered&lt;/strong&gt; trait we saw before, which lets her drag grabbed
characters around when she moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her &lt;strong&gt;arm blade&lt;/strong&gt; is Reach 2 and extra-strong. She can perform a &lt;strong&gt;Leaping
Slash&lt;/strong&gt; similar to the drone’s, which also inflicts 10 ongoing damage if either
attack hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her triggered actions make her even more dangerous. &lt;strong&gt;Snapping Mandibles&lt;/strong&gt;
triggers when someone hits the warrior with a melee attack. As a reaction, she
attacks their Fortitude and grabs them on a hit. Grabbed targets take 10 damage
when they fail an escape attempt. Her &lt;strong&gt;Compelling Musk&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) is
triggered when she misses with an Arm Blade attack, and lets another dune reaper
within 3 squares make a melee basic attack as an opportunity action. I’m not
going to make a joke about that power name, it’s too easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dune reaper packs number between 5 and 12 (!) individuals. Only one will be a
warrior, though you could say the PCs found more than one pack together if you
want there to be more of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reapers are impossible to train, but sapient humanoids still capture them for
use as arena beasts, and hunt them as a source of leather, organic armor plates,
and blades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These seem to me like yet another pack-based predator, the third or fourth we
saw in this reading. I do like the ominous aberrant touches in both their lore
and mechanics, though. The shriek in particular reminds me a lot of a Hound of
Tindalos.&lt;/p&gt;
