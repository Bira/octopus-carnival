&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hejkin are abominations created by the “rampant use of arcane magic” according
to the book, though it doesn’t specify whether they the product of accident or
deliberate experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These small and twisted humanoids can see beyond the world and into a “heaving,
squirming space filled with nightmares”. Their powers are tied to this place,
and to the nastier primal spirits of Athas. The easy answer here would be that
they have a direct mental connection to the Far Realm, but maybe this is another
nightmare dimension more appropriate to your game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, hejkin venerate the spirits of earth and stone as cold and callous
masters that nevertheless provide life. Their culture forbids shaping or carving
into the earth. This means that people who do strike the earth are seen as
horrible heretics to be eliminated. They also reserve the same hatred for those
who “misuse” arcane magic, which probably means those who use it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hejkin live in natural caves that contain natural water sources. They don’t
shape these in any way, but they do use magic to lay various sigil-based traps
on the walls. They venture out to find food, or they might be driven to a frenzy
by some astrological event or another that holds special meaning in that Other
Place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hejkin tend to target spellcasters, miners, and anyone working on other similar
occupations that they can reach by traveling from their homes. They gleefully
steal food and supplies from their victims and then finally murder them, turning
them into yet more food. No one is safe from their cookpots, not even other
hejkins. This makes them our fifth humanoid cannibals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hejkins are Small Aberrant Humanoids with ground and burrow speeds of 6, plus
Darkvision, Earth Walk and Resist Lightning 5. They often have access to some
sort of lightning magic, though the specifics vary per stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hejkin-sparker&quot;&gt;Hejkin Sparker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one’s particularly infused with lightning. It’s a Level 1 Soldier with 31
HP. Its &lt;strong&gt;Arcing Defense&lt;/strong&gt; gives it +2 to AC and Will while adjacent to another
hejkin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sparker’s &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; do physical damage and mark for a turn. If the target is
bloodied, they mark even on a miss. Their &lt;strong&gt;Grounded Current&lt;/strong&gt; power (recharge
5+) attacks enemies in a Close Burst 2, deals lightning damage, and pulls 2
squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a marked enemy decides to move away or ignore the mark, the hejkin can use
a &lt;strong&gt;Telluric Arc&lt;/strong&gt; as an interrupt. This attacks the triggering enemy’s Reflex
and deals 10 lightning damage on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hejkin-chanter&quot;&gt;Hejkin Chanter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chanter’s song is mostly unintelligible, but sometimes you can discern a
horrible phrase or two. The song gives it power over earth and lightning, and I
guess shaping the earth doesn’t count as heresy if a chanter does it. They’re
Level 2 Controllers with 37 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; to physical damage and slow for a turn. If the target is
bloodied or already slowed, it’s immobilized for a turn instead. &lt;strong&gt;Earth’s
Voice&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge when first bloodied) is a close blast 5 that targets enemies,
deals thunder damage, pushes 3 squares and knocks prone. &lt;strong&gt;Static Song&lt;/strong&gt;
(encounter) is a close burst 3 that deals lightning damage and dazes (save
ends). On a miss it deals half damage and dazes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally we get a little trick: &lt;strong&gt;Twisted Earth&lt;/strong&gt; is a minor action melee attack
against Fortitude that teleports the target on a hit, making it swap places
either with the chanter or with one of the chanter’s allies that’s within 5
squares. Say, why does Team Monster have a brute in the back line?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hejkin-raver&quot;&gt;Hejkin Raver&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one’s even more feral than usual, and has no thoughts in their head other
than a craving for blood. It’s a Level 2 Brute with 45 HP. Its &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; do
physical damage and heal it for 3 HP if the target is bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood Marker&lt;/strong&gt; lets the raver use Claw against an adjacent enemy as a reaction
when it is first bloodied. &lt;strong&gt;Blood Shakes&lt;/strong&gt; is a minor action that targets an
adjacent bloodied enemy and knocks it prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems like the brute that would be stationed at the back row waiting for a
sparker to teleport it into the PCs’ backline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hejkin being right next to halflings and sharing some common traits (like their
size and ground speed) makes me think that they might be corrupted
halflings. Mechanically, they appear to be what you use instead of goblins and
kobolds to challenge beginning adventurers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hejkin don’t collaborate with other humanoids, but they do train and keep all
sorts of insectoid beasts, with a preference for those who can burrow. Kruthiks
and Ankhegs are favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click [here][1] to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athasian halflings are physically identical to their standard 4e counterparts,
but their culture is very different. If you have ever heard of Dark Sun in any
detail, you’ll likely also have heard that it has cannibal halflings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true, but I feel it’s lost a bit of its impact here, halfway down the
critter list for the book. Halflings are the fourth cannibal humanoids we met so
far, after belgois, braxats, and gith. I’m not even counting all the magical
beasts that eat sapients, or we’d be here all day reciting names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They still have the disctinction of being our first &lt;em&gt;playable&lt;/em&gt; cannibals. Most
Dark Sun halflings belong to the tribal cultures that inhabit the Forest Ridge,
one of the last remaining green regions of Athas. They’re very territorial and
distrustful of other species, violently defending their homes from any
invasion. Their cannibalism is mostly ritualistic, though the book also says
they eat captured intruders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals or small groups often leave the Forest Ridge to explore the Seven
Cities and the deserts between them. Some stick around and find employment as
guides, scouts and trackers. The worst among them might become slavers or
raiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halfling tribes will deal honorably with those that are honorable to them in
turn, but anyone who breaks an oath to a halfling tribe will be declared their
eternal enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other distinction halflings have is that they’re some of the oldest sapient
peoples of Athas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athasian halflings have the exact same stats as standard ones. They’re Small
Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 6 and the &lt;strong&gt;Nimble Reaction&lt;/strong&gt; trait
that gives them +2 to AC against opportunity attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the stat blocks here are enthusiastic users of poison, which is a good
survival strategy in a world where everyone is larger than you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;halfling-forest-runner&quot;&gt;Halfling Forest Runner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your typical sneaky halfling scout-type, this is a Level 2 Skirmisher with 37
HP. They fight with a &lt;strong&gt;poisoned spear&lt;/strong&gt; that does a mix of physical and poison
damage, and have a special technique named &lt;strong&gt;Strike and Slip Away&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge
4+) that lets them make a stronger spear attack that deals ongoing poison damage
(save ends). As an effect they can then shift 5 squares and make a Stealth test
to hide if they have any cover or concealment at the end of this shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;halfling-wilder&quot;&gt;Halfling Wilder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A halfling psion trained in their ancient traditions. This one is Level 3
Artillery with 38 HP. Their main ranged attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Thrust&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10)
that deals psychic damage and makes the target grant combat advantage for a
turn. They have a simple &lt;strong&gt;club&lt;/strong&gt; for melee emergencies. All of their attacks
dels extra damage when the target grants combat advantage, making them good at
focused fire tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;halfling-forest-keeper&quot;&gt;Halfling Forest Keeper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty traditional druid of the sort that loves summoning and
controlling vines and plants… which makes it a very exotic and mysterious
spellcaster by Athasian standards, where everyone else has sand and sun
powers. Forest Keepers are respected leaders of their people, responsible for
preserving their oral traditions and lore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our stat block here is for a Level 6 Controller with the Leader tag and 72
HP. Its melee basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Distracting Staff&lt;/strong&gt; that does standard damage
on a hit and lets an ally of the keeper within 5 squares shift 1 square. At
range if fires &lt;strong&gt;Thorn Darts&lt;/strong&gt; that deal poison damage and make the target
vulnerable 5 to poison for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit Creepers&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) is our “vines” spell, an Area Burst 2 within
10 that affects only enemies, targets Reflex, deals physical damage, and
restrains on a hit (save ends). Allies caught in the burst recover 5 HP instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constricting Creepers&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) is a stronger version that deals physical
damage in a Close Burst 3 around the keeper, and knocks prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;halfling-headhunter&quot;&gt;Halfling Headhunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An elite champion whose mission is to stalk and eliminate the tribe’s worst
enemies… and to bring their heads as proof. It’s a Level 11 Skirmisher with
114 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The headhunter’s attacks all do extra damage when it has &lt;strong&gt;combat
advantage&lt;/strong&gt;. Its main weapon is a &lt;strong&gt;kukri&lt;/strong&gt; that does a blend of physical and
poison damage, and it can also throw equally poisoned &lt;strong&gt;Javelins&lt;/strong&gt; that also
slow on a hit. &lt;strong&gt;Harrying Attack&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) lets the headhunter make a
dagger attack, shift 3 squares, and then make another dagger attack all as part
of the same action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They use these tools to stay at the edges of a fight and harry the
squishies. Add some leveled-up wilders to make them even stronger by making the
PCs vulnerable to poison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their Forest Ridge homes, halflings are very unlikely to be accompanied by
humanoids of other species, but they do domesticate a lot of the local wildlife
for use in battle. In another twist that seems extremely exotic to Athasians and
very familiar to us, most of this wildlife consists of mammals and birds,
instead of reptiles and insects. Panthers, kirres (which we’ll see soon),
griffons, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When met in the general Seven Cities area, they join the pool of species you can
draw from to assemble Mixed Parties of People.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halflings are very skirmisher-y here, and it looks like all stat blocks are
simple enough that you can adjust their level directly without having to make
big changes to their abilities. Monster Manual halfling stats work well in
conjunction with these, though I’d replace any slings with poison darts or the
equivalent to keep the flavor.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Goliath</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dark Sun always had “half-giants” ever since its 2e days. They were very large,
very strong, and had this funky random alignment rule. Here in Fourth Edition,
they’ve been syncretized with goliaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athasian goliaths are also known as half-giants. They’re not a natural species,
but a product of sorcerer-king experimentation blending human and giant
DNA. Nowadays, most goliaths live in the city-states, but there are communities
of them out in the mountains of the Tyr Region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s official: The Dark Sun Creature Catalog has nothing nice to say
about &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;. Here, it says city-dwelling goliaths are brutal enforcers for
the templars and the Sorcerer-Kings, and that mountain-dwelling ones are
“barbaric raiders” who have little use for companions who are not “pets or
slaves”. Some of them dwell among the giants of the Sea of Silt, where they are
treated as menial servants but also permitted to take part in raiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2e lore about half-giants said they were so lolrandom that you actually rolled
on a table every day to see what half your alignment would be. This is gone from
their 4e incarnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-number&quot;&gt;The Number&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, goliaths are Natural Humanoids and occupy the very high end of Medium
size. Their speed is 6, and their signature power is &lt;strong&gt;Stone’s Endurance&lt;/strong&gt;, a
minor action encounter power that gives them some amount of damage resistance
for a turn. Here, the specifics vary per stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;goliath-enforcer&quot;&gt;Goliath Enforcer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Representing your typical goliath thug, raider, or mercenary, this is a Level 8
Brute with 105 HP. It’s armed with a &lt;strong&gt;Greatclub&lt;/strong&gt;, and if surrounded by PCs it
can &lt;strong&gt;Push Through&lt;/strong&gt; as a minor action. This is an attack vs. Fortitude that
deals no damage, pushes 1 square, knocks prone, and lets the goliath shift into
the vacated square. It recharges once it’s first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone’s Endurance here gives Resist All 5 for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the enforcer is reduced to 0 HP, &lt;strong&gt;Vengeful Clout&lt;/strong&gt; lets it make one last
attack with &lt;strong&gt;Vengeful Clout&lt;/strong&gt;, targetting Fortitude, dealing greatclub damage,
and knocking prone on a hit. Despite the name, the enforcer doesn’t have to
target the person who defeated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;goliath-enforcer-legbreaker&quot;&gt;Goliath Enforcer Legbreaker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the same Goliath Enforcer from before as seen by PCs in the mid-Paragon
tier, who have far surpassed it in skill. It’s a Level 16 Minion Brute. It has
the same Greatclub and Vengeful Clout attacks as the regular level 8 version,
but dealing appropriate damage for its level and minion-ness. Its Stone’s
Endurance makes it take no damage from the next attack that hits it before the
end of its next turn, which sounds powerful but is the only version of the
ability that would make any difference on a minion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to note that both the Enforcer and the Legbreaker are worth 350
XP, so XP total ends up being an interesting guideline for when to upgrade or
downgrade a monster’s quality as it goes down or up in level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;goliath-gladiator&quot;&gt;Goliath Gladiator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A better-trained goliath fighter usually met in the arena, with a big bone
greataxe and an arsenal of fancy tricks. It’s a Level 11 Soldier with 114 HP and
the Leader tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attacks of the &lt;strong&gt;Bone Greataxe&lt;/strong&gt; deal standard damage and immediately end
the target’s marks on the gladiator. It can also use the weapon in a &lt;strong&gt;Leg
Strike&lt;/strong&gt; that targets Fortitude, deals the same amount of damage, slows and
prevents the target from shifting for a turn. And finally, it can be used in a
&lt;strong&gt;Skull Cleaver&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver that also targets Fortitude, deals heavy damage,
daze, and impose a -2 penalty to saves (save ends both). This recharges when the
goliath misses with the power, so it will keep trying until it hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks to me like the gladiator really wants to get past the party’s defenders
with the help of its basic attacks, and then use the special maneuvers on the
party’s squishies that are likely to have a worse Fortitide defense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goliath’s leaderly abilities are all Minor Actions: &lt;strong&gt;Get Up!&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge
5+) lets an adjacent ally either stand up as a free action, or make a save
against a dazing, immobilizing or restraining effect. &lt;strong&gt;Offensive Form&lt;/strong&gt; lets it
mark every adjacent enemy for a turn. Its Stone’s Endurance gives Resist 10 All
for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;goliath-kings-guard&quot;&gt;Goliath King’s Guard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you finally go meet that crime boss or petty warlord who has an army of
goliath legbreakers at his service, these are the dudes who will be standing
next to him as his elite bodyguards. They’re Level 16 Soldiers with 154 HP,
wielding halberds and wearing scale armor. Their weapons give them &lt;strong&gt;Threatening
Reach&lt;/strong&gt; 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might also have metal blades, because their basic attack is described as a
&lt;strong&gt;Halberd&lt;/strong&gt; without any material qualifiers as “bone” or “obsidian”. They do
standard damage, slide the target one square and mark it for a turn. The
&lt;strong&gt;Mighty Clout&lt;/strong&gt; technique (recharge 5+) deals heavy damage, slides 1 square,
and knocks prone. Their Stone’s Endurance gives them Resist 10 All for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relatively simple stat block, but it’s good at its job of preventing PCs from
getting close to the boss. As mentioned above, it goes well with a small
army of legbreaker minions in addition to the boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the vitriol heaped upon them by the book, ultimately Goliaths also fit
the category of People, so you might find them in the usual Mixed People
Encounters as well. They can be allies or enemies, free or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stat blocks are pretty simple. Big fighters with big weapons. I thought the
gladiator was the standout here, lots of interesting martial tricks on that one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Golem</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;That’s the title of the entry, but I’ll try to not to use it outside of the
monster names since it’s a bit appropriative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As as far as D&amp;amp;D goes, these are our “top-tier” constructs, usually placed in
guardian roles but sometimes found following their creator around and responding
to direct commands from them. They’re made by binding an elemental into a
physical shell made out of some material, as we saw in the Monster Manual/Vault
reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bone, clay, flesh and stone constructs are as common here as they are in other
settings, but not even the wealthiest and most wasteful of Sorcerer Kings would
make a construct out of iron, let alone other metals. Instead, Athasian wizards
have developed other models made of more commonly available materials. This
doesn’t mean the constructs themselves are common, as most of the rituals to
make them are jealously guarded secrets, and even those who still know them
don’t necessarily know the theory behind the recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind you, metal constructs might still be found in the depths of some Green Age
or Red Age ruins, and they remain exceedingly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our specimens here are Large Natural Animates with the Construct
tag. They’re immune to disease, poison, and sleep. Everything else varies per
stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;salt-golem&quot;&gt;Salt Golem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a construct made out of rock salt, which has some different properties
from common stone. The most relevant here is that it’s surrounded by a haze of
salt particles shed from its main body, which it can control. Salt is highly
toxic at these concentrations and the creature can send it right into your
bloodstream if you have any open wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt constructs are Level 11 Elite Brutes with 278 HP, a ground speed of 5
(cannot shift), and Darkvision. They’re surrounded by a haze of &lt;strong&gt;Toxic Salt&lt;/strong&gt;
that acts as an aura (2), which inflicts -2 to the defenses of any enemy
inside. If the enemy is bloodied, it also takes 5 poison damage when it starts
its turn in the aura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature attacks with the now-traditional &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals heavy damage
and on a hit inflicts 5 ongoing poison damage and -2 to attacks (save ends
both). &lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt; lets it slam twice in one action. Its special attack
controls that salt cloud to cause &lt;strong&gt;Horrid Dehydration&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 3, enemies
only, recharge 4+), which damages then weakens and slows for a turn. If the
target is bloodied it the conditions become (save ends both) instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dune-golem&quot;&gt;Dune Golem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a construct made out of loose sand bound together by air magic. It can
hold a humanoid shape, but it’s diffuse instead of solid, making it particularly
resistant to conventional attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dune construct is a Level 13 Elite Soldier with 184 HP. It has a ground speed
of 5, and a burrow speed of 5 on loose earth. In addition to the standard
immunities to disease, sleep, and poison, it also takes half damage from melee
and ranged attacks. Unlike its solid cousins from this entry, it can shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature is surrounded by an aura (2) of &lt;strong&gt;Gusting Sands&lt;/strong&gt;, which counts as
difficult terrain for enemies inside. Whenever such an enemy tries to stand up
from prone inside the aura, they must roll a save. If they fail, they stay prone
and waste the action they spent trying to get up. We also see the &lt;strong&gt;Unhindered&lt;/strong&gt;
trait here, which lets the construct pull grabbed victims along when it moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The construct’s &lt;strong&gt;Slams&lt;/strong&gt; deal the usual damage, and grab on a hit. It can have
up to two grabbed victims, and can sustain the grabs for free. It has &lt;strong&gt;Double
Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, so it could grab two victims in the same action if it hits with both
slams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grabbed victims are susceptible to &lt;strong&gt;Engulf&lt;/strong&gt;, a minor action attack that deals
light damage but starts inflicting ongoing 15 damage until the grab ends!  And
then you have &lt;strong&gt;Shifting Sands&lt;/strong&gt; a move action power that lets the construct
either shift its speed, or to shift half its speed and gain phasing during this
movement. While shifting, it ignores difficult terrain and can move through
enemy spaces, so this is a good escape hatch in addition to being a way to play
keep-away with the suffocating grabbed victims and their allies. One special
condition with the phasing here is that it only works if the surface in question
has a hole wide enough to let a grain of sand through, which shouldn’t be a
problem in most cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;obsidian-golem&quot;&gt;Obsidian Golem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another construct made from a type of stone with specific properties. In this
case, obsidian is more or less natural volcanic glass. Like the stone they’re
made from, these constructs are very very sharp. They’re also deceptively fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are Level 19 Elite Soldiers with 358 HP. Their speed is merely 4 and they
cannot shift, but they’re &lt;strong&gt;Razor Sharp&lt;/strong&gt;. This property is modeled as an aura
(1). Any enemy inside the aura that moves to another square inside the aura
takes 10 damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of Double Attack, obsidian constructs have &lt;strong&gt;Inexorable Action&lt;/strong&gt;, which
lets them roll initiative twice and take two whole turns per round at those
counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The construct’s &lt;strong&gt;Slams&lt;/strong&gt; deal the usual brute-tier damage, push 1 square, knock
prone, and inflict ongoing 5 damage (save ends) from the bits of obsidian that
break off and get stuck in the wound. It can also use a &lt;strong&gt;Stunning Handclap&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 6+) which attacks all enemies in a Close Burst 5. On a hit it deals
thunder damage and stuns for a turn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rechargeable multi-target stun is a terrifying prospect. A lucky recharge roll
might let the creature use this twice in a round, which is a very bad thing for
the PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re gonna run into some of these things eventually in any D&amp;amp;D campaign that
goes on for long enough, and these ones are reasonably interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If guarding a site, they’ll either be accompanied by more constructs or by other
long-lasting guardians such as undead, devils, or demons. If found as
bodyguards, they’ll be accompanied by their masters and any other goons you care
to add to the group.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-gith.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things we learned about the cosmology of Athas early in the Campaign
Setting reading is that its Shadowfell is locally known as the Gray, and it’s
suspected to block access to the Astral Sea and any other worlds beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This becomes relevant here, because the people known as the Gith are said to
have arrived on Athas long ago, sailing from beyond the Gray in silvery
ships. Once here, however, they found out they couldn’t go back. To make matters
worse, these alien visitors found out that they were particularly susceptible to
the corruptive influences of Athasian arcane magic, which turned them Darker and
Sunnier over the generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present-day gith are more monstrous in appearance than the ones you’re used
to. Their mindset is also more monstrous, which is saying something considering
these were probably githyanki invaders to start with. Despite the mutations
they’ve undergone, they retain their psychic abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gith organize in nomadic hunter communities, wandering through the moutains and
the Tablelands region. They make no particular distinction between standard
animals and sapient outsiders when it comes to chosing their prey, and think
both make fine eating. Some Gith groups are dedicated to gathering the scattered
parts of their original ships, hoping to reassemble them so they can get off
this rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gith are Medium Natural Humanoids with Speed 6. Their signature power is the
same as that of standard githyanki: &lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic Leap&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter power
that lets them fly 5 squares as a move action. Other attacks and abilities vary
with training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gith-savage&quot;&gt;Gith Savage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rank-and-file of any large gith raiding force, the book describes their
lives as nasty, brutish, and short. These Level 4 Minion Skirmishers fight with
obsidian-tipped spears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gith’s basic &lt;strong&gt;Spear&lt;/strong&gt; attack damages and lets it shift 1 square. Once per
encounter they can enhance one attack into a &lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic Pierce&lt;/strong&gt;, which
targets Fortitude, deals the same damage and pushes the target 1 square. I think
this above might be the first psychic power I’ve seen that &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; target
Will. There are a few others in this entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gith-hobbler&quot;&gt;Gith Hobbler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These hunters are level 4 Artillery with 46 HP. They prefer to stay far away
throwing Range 20 &lt;strong&gt;Javelins&lt;/strong&gt;. Once per encounter they can throw a particularly
well-aimed &lt;strong&gt;Pinning Javelin&lt;/strong&gt;, that does a bit more damage and immobilizes
(save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone gets too close, they’re subject to the hobbler’s aura (1) of &lt;strong&gt;Brain
Fog&lt;/strong&gt;, which inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks and damage to enemies inside. I
wonder if there’s one of these near me these days. Someone who insists on
attacking them in melee might force the hobbler to use its &lt;strong&gt;bone dagger&lt;/strong&gt;,
which does light damage and lets them shift 1 square on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gith-spearhead&quot;&gt;Gith Spearhead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A front-line fighter wielding a barbed obsidian-headed spear. It’s a Level 5
Brute with 76 HP. The &lt;strong&gt;Vicious Spear&lt;/strong&gt; is pretty strong, as expected of a
brute, and can be used in a &lt;strong&gt;Focused Stab&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+) that deals more
damage and knocks prone. If the target is bloodied, the attack deals &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt;
damage and dazes (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the spearhead is reduced to 0 HP, it lets out an &lt;strong&gt;Ancestor’s Appeal&lt;/strong&gt;, a
Close Burst 1 that targets Fortitude and deals psychic damage. In addition to
the damage, a hit also inflicts ongoing 5 psychic damage, and a further 5
psychic damage whenever the target uses a daily or encounter power (save ends
both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;git-drone&quot;&gt;Git Drone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drones are gith that show increased psychic aptitude as children, and are
subject to a torturous training regimen to further develop their powers. They’re
Level 5 Controllers with 62 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drones emit a &lt;strong&gt;Brain Fog&lt;/strong&gt; aura that works like the hobbler’s, but is much
wider in radius (3). They fight with &lt;strong&gt;Bone Daggers&lt;/strong&gt; in melee and with
&lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic Thrusts&lt;/strong&gt; at up to range 5. These deal force damage, and slide 2
squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every so often they can use a &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Nova&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+). This is an Area
Burst 1 Within 5 that targets Reflex, deals untyped damage, and makes the target
suffer 5 psychic damage whenever they use a daily or encounter power (save
ends). If the target is bloodied, it instead deals ongoing 5 damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one time I briefly played a Dark Sun game, one of the PCs was a “standard”
gith fighter, so I had thought the gith of Athas were both unchanged from their
astral relatives and playable. Turns out I was wrong! Mechanically they’re still
similar to githyanki, but their look and feel is pretty different than what I
expected, and there are no rules for gith PCs in the Campaign Setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gith are commonly found in all-gith hunting parties, perhaps accompanied by
domesticated baazrags or other trained beasties. They can also be found in mixed
parties of People, whether as willing members or as slaves commanded to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Quar and Their Guns in GURPS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I became aware of the Quar. Aren’t they neat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/quar-unit.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  squirrel handler. Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://rhyfler.com&quot;&gt;https://rhyfler.com&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These funny anteater people are the stars of a couple of miniature wargames, the
28mm-scale &lt;strong&gt;Clash of Rhyfles&lt;/strong&gt; and the 15mm-scale &lt;strong&gt;This Quar’s War&lt;/strong&gt;. Both of
these have their rulebooks freely available &lt;a href=&quot;https://rhyfler.com&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, which is also where the
image above comes from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An individual Quar is a funny little person who just wants to chill with a hot
cup of tea and a plate of moth cakes. Quar &lt;em&gt;societies&lt;/em&gt; however are very, er,
quarrelsome, so most of their history is an endless procession of wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was motivated to write this article both because I think the setting is neat,
and because the technical information about Quar weapons in the Clash of Rhyfles
game made me think I can stat them up in GURPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;very-short-setting-summary&quot;&gt;Very Short Setting Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wargames cover a particularly turbulent period in the history of Aldwyn, the
Quar home world. It’s marked by at least twenty years of worldwide trench
warfare between two large multinational coalitions. The tech level is somewhere
between WW1 and WW2, and this is pretty much the war that introduced industrial
warfare to their world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the idea of these adorable creatures being fed into one of the worst
meat-grinders imaginable is horrifying to you, then you get the setting’s main
idea. I’ve heard it described as “grimsical”. It replaces the “dark” vibe from
“grimdark” with “whimsical”, but it’s still grim. The cuter the miniatures for
their soldiers and tanks get, the stronger the dissonance becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Clash or Rhyfles quickstart book centers on the two main factions of the
war. The Crusade is a coalition of former monarchies who successfully toppled
their old regimes and became republics. They’re led by the Republic of Tok, and
made up of many smaller nations that follow the same standards for equipment and
tactics. The rules here could be used for quar from any of those places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, the Kingdom of Coftyr leads an alliance of the world’s
remaining monarchies to stamp out this revolution. Each kingdom here tends to be
visually distinct, as their whole thing is adherence to ancient traditions and
heraldry. Therefore, the book only covers Coftyr itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free add-ons provide details for “sub-factions” allied to either side. These are
Crusader or monarchist nations who do their own thing on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual for wargames, both sides are morally ambiguous. Opposing monarchy is a
good thing in my book, but the Crusade is also the side that introduced
industrial warfare to the world. Coftyr flavor text is all about honor and
chivalry and heroism, but they adopted industrial warfare just as readily and at
the end of the day are still defenders of absolute monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get the impression that the world of Alwyn could settle into a more or less
stable configuration if everyone just stopped and signed a status quo peace
treaty, but they’ve all been fighting for 20 years by now and none of their
leaders show any sign of wanting to stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual for wargames, you pick the side you think looks neater, paint them up,
and pit them against other factions in battles that would fit somewhere in those
decades of war. Most of these battles focus on infantry with the occasional
tanks thrown in. There seem to be airships, but I don’t know if they have
airplanes yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quar-in-gurps&quot;&gt;Quar in GURPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical Quar is about 1.5 meters tall and weights around 60kg. They follow a
largely humanoid body plan. Their skins can take on any of a large number of
hues, from yellows and greens to blues and purples and oranges. Often, they’re a
little mottled. Their diet tends to include lots of bugs, though those are often
prepared as ingredients in dishes that we would otherwise recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stat-wise, I’d say they are absolutely identical to humans. If you insist on
being strict, make them about a foot shorter than their ST would indicate, but
do not adjust their stats in any other way. Being a Quar costs 0 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that’s the thing, you see? Quar are just people. The horrors inflicted
on them are horrible because &lt;em&gt;war&lt;/em&gt; is horrible, not because Quar are adorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quar-guns-in-gurps&quot;&gt;Quar Guns in GURPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guns in Clash or Rhyfles don’t actually have damage ratings, just range and
optional traits. The results of a ranged attack roll depend entirely on the
degree of success for your skill roll. They might leave a target unaffected,
Gobsmacked (stunned) or Taken Out, which is different from “dead”: they might
still be rescued during or after the battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the skirmish game rules include enough fluff about the infantry weapons
of the Crusade that I kinda want to try statting them up in GURPS. If I ever get
the same information for the Coftyri ones, I’ll stat them up too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book mentiones the muzzle velocity and caliber of a couple of the weapons,
and if I make a guess about the weight of the bullet I can plug those three
things in the simplest possible version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamingballistic.com/2022/04/11/old-ballistics-spreadsheet-a-repost/&quot;&gt;unofficial official GURPS
ballistics equation&lt;/a&gt; to get a damage figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That link also contains a complete spreadsheet that demands things like chamber
pressure, which I have no chance of figuring out. So stuff like Accuracy and
range will be derived by the older method of eyeballing existing guns, as will
bullet weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers in the original material are just there for color, of course. None
of them affect the rules of the miniature wargame itself. But if we take them as
true, we see that Quar are very fond guns with big bullets and powerful
propellant charges, fired out of guns with short barrels and very light
construction. The recoil on those is gonna be ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-bogen-rifle&quot;&gt;The Bogen Rifle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signature weapon of the Crusade rhyfler, the Bogen semi-automatic rifle is
said to fire a 12mm bullet at 580m/s. It uses a 5 or 10 round magazine and
weights 2.4kg “fully loaded”. Its effective range is 150-250 meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest real-world bullet to this one in GURPS High-Tech is the
.45-something family of rifle rounds, which are 11.43mm in diameter and weight
31 grams. After some fiddling, I decide to go with a slightly lower 27 grams for
the Quar bullet, which gives us exactly 7d damage. This is pi+ because of the
caliber. Picture them as being broader, shorter and rounder than Earth rifle
cartridges, which is in theme for all things Quar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives us a gun that packs about the same punch as a real-world M1 Garand
rifle while having almost exactly half its weight and about the length of an M16
assault rifle. That’s going to have a significant kick, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;

      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bogen&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7d pi+&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;900/3500&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2.4kg/0.36kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5(3)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;11†&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-rhyshi-r4-heavy-rifle&quot;&gt;The Rhyshi (R4) Heavy Rifle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only slightly longer than the Bogen, the Rhyshi fires a huge 20mm round with a
720m/s muzzle velocity. Its magazine carries seven of those, and it’s said to
require a solid stance and firm support to shoot with any kind of accuracy. A
squad mate’s shoulder will do for support, according to the book, but I’m going
to give this rifle an integral folding bipod because I’m not a monster. A
properly braced R4 has greater range than the Bogen, and can penetrate up to
“medium” vehicular armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest thing to this I can find on High-Tech is the Mauser Tank-Gewehr 18,
the WW1 German anti-tank rifle. Its caliber is “only” 13mm, but it’s the largest
anti-tank rifle in that table that is even removely Quar-portable. Plugging its
bullet mass, caliber and printed velocity in our magic spreadsheet, we get 10d+3
damage, which following High-Tech convention can be rounded and written as
5dx2. Let’s also give it an armor-piercing round, because I see the WW1 tank
examples in the book have DR 45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5dx2 is the same damage as the T-Gew18, but the Rhyshi again weights less than
half of what the real gun does. It’s not that much longer than the Bogen either,
so it’s gonna be a beast to handle unless it’s properly braced. As the book
says, Quar Crusaders frequently attach a bayonet to the Rhyshi because there’s
no way it can be fired in close quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Rhyshi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5dx2(2) pi+&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1100/4400&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7.5kg/1kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7(3)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;18B†&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grifkis-shotgun&quot;&gt;Grifkis Shotgun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a 10-gauge, six-kilo trench gun firing buckshot ammo. The only Crusade
gun to still be largely hand-made, it’s carried by officers as a badge of honor
and a symbol of courage. The illustration shows its barrel is fairly short, but
it still has a shoulder stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need to fiddle with spreadsheets this time, we have a 10G double-barrel
shotgun in High Tech. Let’s borrow its stats and adjust for the shortened
“whippet” barrels:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Grifkis&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2d-1 pi&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;40/800&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6kg/0.15kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2x13&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;2(3i)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;12†&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;1/7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short barrels give this gun a more pronounced muzzle blast (+1 to Hearing
and Vision to locate when fired in the dark). I’m using the listed weight for it
here, which makes it about 50% heavier than the real world example from
High-Tech. Big caliber, two barrels, extra chonky? This is basically the Doom
Super Shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;h-11a-light-machine-gun&quot;&gt;H-11a Light Machine Gun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the book, this LMG fires the same round as the Bogen rifle, and the
Crusade likes to use it as an offensive squad support weapon. It appears longer
than the rifle, and can also be used in vehicular mounts when the force can’t
find heavier MGs to put in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I’m just going to crib from High-Tech again, and blend some of the
Bogen’s stats with those of the MG34.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;H-11a&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7d pi+&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;900/3500&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;15kg/2.5kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;15&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;50(5)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;12B†&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives us a gun that’s actually heavier than the Rhyshi rifle, and whose
recoil is manageable enough that it’s worth firing more than one bullet per
turn. It fires rounds from a non-disintegrating cloth belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at those things. Just look at them. Their damage values combined with the
light weight and short barrel means they have &lt;em&gt;powerful&lt;/em&gt; powder charges. Quar
like big booms and they cannot lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recoil on these things means the act of firing them is somewhere between
“comical” and “painful for the shooter”. I’m guessing that a Taken Out result in
the wargame very often means the target got spooked and decided to play dead,
instead of actually being hit. This also explains why a quar can take
&lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt; out on a bad skill roll.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Giant</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athas has a lot of the same giants we can see in the Monster Manuals and Monster
Vault. Athasian giants are less militarily aggressive than their counterparts in
other worlds, but they still don’t like interacting with the “small folk”. They
prefer to make their homes in isolated islands on the Silt Sea. A giant who
wants to visit the mainland can often just &lt;em&gt;wade through&lt;/em&gt; what to them is
chest-high silt. PCs might be able to negotiate a ride with such a giant, if
they’re diplomatic enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this entry we’ll take a look at two Athas-specific giants, whose descriptions
will help explain why they don’t like the small ones very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beast-giants&quot;&gt;Beast Giants&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-giant-beast.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beast Giants are the product of psionic experimentation by ancient masters of
the Way, who have stabilized into their own species. They have bodies similar to
that of hill giants, but the heads of beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each giant’s head is different, and can be similar to that of any Athasian
beast, whether currently living or extinct. So PCs might be faced with something
familiar like a Cilops or Baazrag-headed giant, or with some exotic ancient
cryptid like a lion, tiger or bear. Oh my! Their skill at mind-reading is such
that they can copy most techniques used against them on the fly during a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beast Giants are fairly cosmopolitan sorts and frequently associate with other
types of giant and giant-kin who share their islands: hill giants, firbolgs,
brohgs, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beast-giant&quot;&gt;Beast Giant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical beast giant is Large Natural Humanoid (Giant) and a Level 15 Brute
with 180 HP and a ground speed of 7 and Low-light Vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what their head looks like, it gives them a &lt;strong&gt;Rending Bite&lt;/strong&gt; that
deals heavy immediate damage and ongoing 5 damage (save ends). Once per
encounter they can use the &lt;strong&gt;Red of Tooth&lt;/strong&gt; power to make three bite attacks on
the same action, each against a different target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone attacks a beast giant, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Retention&lt;/strong&gt; as a
reaction. They still suffer the damage and any riders normally, but they also
“retain” that result, so keep a note of it. They can then use this to power
their &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Release&lt;/strong&gt; attack (melee 2 vs. Fortitude). A hit deals the exact
same amount and type of damage, and the exact same riders, as the giant’s
“retained” attack. Psionic Release recharges when the giant uses Psionic
Retention again, so it effectively “spends” the retained attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beast-titan&quot;&gt;Beast Titan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oldest Beast Giants have grown enough in power and size to qualify as Beast
Titans. They’re a lot more aggressive than their younger counterparts and love
displaying the skulls of their enemies as trophies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are Huge instead of Large, and they’re Level 20 Elite Brutes with 466
HP. Their ground speed is an 8, and their &lt;strong&gt;Beast Reflexes&lt;/strong&gt; let them roll a
save to avoid falling prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their Psionic Retention and Release powers work the same as the giant’s, with
the greater range and numbers from their larger size and level. Their &lt;strong&gt;Gnashing
Bite&lt;/strong&gt; is also upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action the titan can use &lt;strong&gt;Titan’s Embrace&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 3 vs. reflex) to
do some light damage and grab on a hit. And once it has a grabbed victim, it can
use &lt;strong&gt;Head Rip&lt;/strong&gt; to deal massive damage, plus the same ongoing damage as the
bite. The giant also throws the victim 10 squares and knocks it prone at the
end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shadow-giant&quot;&gt;Shadow Giant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Death Giants of the monster manual, who are merely death-_themed_,
Shadow Giants are actual undead. They’re vengeful spirits who seek retribution
from an ancient slaughter, likely from the Red Age. They look like shadows cast
on a wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They tend to be loners, or to ally with those giants that still retain a strong
elemental connection (like fire and stone giants). Sometimes, a brohg renegade
will seek them out to learn the ancient arcane secrets the shadow still
rememebers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow Giants are Large Shadow Humanoids with the Undead and Giant tags, and
Level 18 Soldiers with 185 HP. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 7, and a
flight speed of 3. Like most undead, they are immune to disease and poison and
have 20 necrotic resistance. They’re also insubstantial, but lack Phasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shadow giant projects an aura (5) of &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Malaise&lt;/strong&gt; that halves any
healing that takes place inside. Whenever they take radiant damage, they’re
&lt;strong&gt;Revealed by Radiance&lt;/strong&gt; and become substantial for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Necrotic Touch&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets Reflex, deals necrotic
damage, and marks on a hit (save ends). They also have a non-basic &lt;strong&gt;Death
Touch&lt;/strong&gt; that is similar, but exchanges some of its direct damage for an
additional ongoing 10 necrotic damage rider (save ends both this and the mark).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a marked enemy makes an attack that doesn’t include the giant, they are
&lt;strong&gt;Cast Into Shadow&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction. This is a melee attack that targets
Reflex. A hit does no damage, but removes the target from play for a turn! This
means they’re stunned and removed from the map, reappearing at their previous
position when the effect ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The giant’s ability to possibly mark multiple PCs makes it a very effective
“defender”. Cast Into Shadow is a very potent “save or suck” attack, so PCs will
have an extra incentive to focus on the giant and not on its other buddies. And
if they don’t, the giant has just removed a whole PC from consideration for the
next round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athas is prime giant country and plenty of core giants would be happy as clams
living here, but I guess it makes sense to have some setting-specific ones to
signal that we’re not in Kansas any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beast giants and titans feel a bit redundant, but their appearance is certainly
striking. Shadow Giants have intriguing mechanics, but you probably don’t want
to have more than one of these in play at any given encounter. They can also be
used in other settings without a lot of modification, as “undead giant with a
grudge” is a pretty universal concept.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Ghost, Raaig</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-ghost-raaig.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athas is a world with plenty of horrible death in it, so of course it has plenty
of ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ghosts we’re talking about in this entry are also called “raaigs”, so you
can use that word when nomenclature is important and you want to distinguish
them from wraiths, specters, or the specific D&amp;amp;D monster actually called a
Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are specifically the ghosts of priests and holy warriors that served the
now-dead gods of Athas, and who met their demise while charged with protecting
their holy sites and relics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical encounter with a raaig will happen when the PCs enter the ruins of
such a place. The ghost, still fulfilling its mission, will manifest and
challenge the intruders to check whether they’re devout pilgrims or dastardly
thieves. Since no one alive remembers the proper prayers and passwords to
appease these spirits, they are likely to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raaigs have the full ghost package: ground and flight speeds of 6, Darkvision,
phasing, insubstantial, immune to disease and poison. The book mentions they
become corporeal for a moment when they attack, but this moment doesn’t last
long enough to influence their stat blocks, which considers them to be
insubstantial at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They don’t have any weaknesses that let them become partially corporeal
either, so the only way to deal full damage to a raaig is if you’re using the
rules update that makes force damage fully affect all insubstantial creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raaig-tomb-spirit&quot;&gt;Raaig Tomb Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your common specimen as far as these very specific ghosts go. The Tomb Spirit is
a Level 9 Soldier with 66 HP, which looks like a small number until you remember
it will be taking half damage from everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tomb spirit projects an aura (1) of &lt;strong&gt;Gripping Dread&lt;/strong&gt;, which forbids
enemies inside from shifting and deals 5 cold damage to enemies marked by the
spirit who make an attack that doesn’t target it. This is a spooky version of
the Paladin’s mark mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its main attack is a &lt;strong&gt;chilling blade&lt;/strong&gt; that deals cold damage. As a minor
action once per round it can issue the &lt;strong&gt;Raaig’s Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets
Will, and pulls 2 squares and marks for a turn on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raaig-crypt-lord&quot;&gt;Raaig Crypt Lord&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A higher-ranking guardian in life, the Crypt Lord is a Level 14 Soldier with the
Leader tag and 96 HP. It’s mostly a Tomb Spirit with bigger numbers and improved
abilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;strong&gt;Chilling Blade&lt;/strong&gt; deals more damage and marks on a hit; its &lt;strong&gt;Gripping
Dread&lt;/strong&gt; has a radius of 2; ts &lt;strong&gt;Challenge&lt;/strong&gt; pulls 4 squares instead of 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one new ability here is &lt;strong&gt;Ghostly Command&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 6+) which lets each
undead ally within 5 squares of the lord shift 2 squares and make a basic
attack. As this takes a standard action, it will probably be used to open the
fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;raaig-souflame&quot;&gt;Raaig Souflame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the ghost of someone who was so favored by the gods in life that they
retained a small spark of divine power after death. Their hold on this spark is
tenuous, however, and it might leave them if they’re too damaged. In this case,
they will be turned into desperate beasts full of grief and rage. This is a
Level 21 Skirmisher with 138 HP and all raaig traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is that they lose the divine spark when bloodied, and so they
effectively have two sets of abilities and movement speeds - one for when they
have the spark, and one for when they don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When “healthy”, the soulflame has a ground speed of 8 and a teleport speed
of 3. It attacks with a &lt;strong&gt;Divine Blade&lt;/strong&gt; that deals a mix of untyped and radiant
damage and lets the ghost teleport 3 squares on a hit. It can get fancy with
this and use it to perform a &lt;strong&gt;Flickering Phantom&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver (recharge 5+): the
souflame teleports 4 squares, makes a stronger than usual sword attack, then
teleports another 4 squares and makes another, weaker attack. The teleports are
effects, so they happen even if the attacks miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When bloodied, it loses the ability to teleport and gains a flight speed of 8
instead. Its main attack becomes a &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Blade&lt;/strong&gt; whose added damage is
necrotic instead of radiant, and which makes the target only regain half HP from
healing for a turn. Its Flickering Phantom ability is replaced with &lt;strong&gt;Hollow
Rage&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter power that deals heavy damage and prevents the target from
regaining HP entirely (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book says raaigs are intelligent and strong-willed enough to take command of
most other undead that haunt their temples, such as skeletons, mummies, and
other ghosts, so these will make up their allies in an encounter. It also
reminds us that not all gods were good - protectors of evil temples might still
have command of the devils or demons that also served its patron god. Souflames
in particular are likely to attract surviving angels that served the same deity,
as they are drawn to that faint spark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me think that a non-hostile raaig makes an excellent mentor and
teached for the super-rare divine PCs of Athas. Maybe your cleric or paladin was
trained by the soulflame who is the Last Priest of Pelor and who was aware
enough to take the PC under their wing instead of treating them as an intruder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if angels and devils arrive to serve such ghosts, that’d be a big draw to
someone who is researching a way into the Astral Sea, as I think that plane is
not normally accessible from Athas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ultra-Tech Dungeon Delving in GURPS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started writing this post a few years ago when I was GMing the Iron Gods
adventure path for Pathfinder using the Dungeon Fantasy RPG rules. My approach
to that campaign was pretty slap-dash, and after I stopped I began thinking of a
more structured way to do it. Since a recent comment here on the blog asked for
specifics, I though I’d dust the post off and publish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have a Dungeon Fantasy game where you want your characters to get
into contact with more advanced technology. How would you go about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ultra-tech-delving-a-survey&quot;&gt;Ultra-Tech Delving: A Survey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Steve Jackson games did a little foray into this area in Pyramid #3/60, in an
article entitled “High-Tech Dungeon Crawl”, which focused on bringing modern-day
characters with guns into fantasy dungeons to mow down orcs with autofire and
take their stuff. This raises the inherent level of colonalism in the genre from
“concerning” to “yikes!”&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I want to focus on here is in an older variation on the theme: fantasy
characters exploring “dungeons” filled with elements you might be more used to
seeing in science fiction stories. When I say “older”, I mean it’s &lt;em&gt;older than
D&amp;amp;D&lt;/em&gt;: Dave Arneson’s Blackmoor campaign featured a whole ultra-tech city-state
descended from the crew of a crashed spaceship, and it was played for several
years before what became the OD&amp;amp;D rules were finalized and officially
published. D&amp;amp;D proper would explore the same territory with its famous
“Expedition to the Barrier Peaks” module.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathfinder dedicates a whole kingdom in its setting to the idea: the land of
Numeria is a barbarian kingdom where a giant spaceship crashed millenia ago,
breaking up during atmospheric entry and scattering its many modules all over
the region. And, of course, in Gamma World and other post-apocalyptic games
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; “dungeons” are ultra-tech because they’re the ruins of the futuristic
civilization that preceded the apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ultra-tech-delving-in-gurps&quot;&gt;Ultra-Tech Delving in GURPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GURPS is of course a uniquely well-suited system for this kind of thing. Its
rules already support a wide range of genres and technology levels from the
corebook onwards. We only need a few adjustments depending on the sort of
campaign we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After The End&lt;/em&gt; already deals with the post-apocalyptic angle and offers a set
of detailed rules. What I want, however, is something simpler and more suited to
a Barrier Peaks/Numeria scenario. The ultra-tech stuff is alien, but characters
can gain an understanding of it with some investment, and the gap between their
usual medievalish milieu and the lofty heights of alien tech isn’t completely
impossible to cross. How would I do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tech-level-or-the-lack-thereof&quot;&gt;Tech Level, or the Lack Thereof.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on one side we have the usual “medievalish” dungeon fantasy setting. In
GURPS, that’s roughtly TL 4, but without gunpowder. On the other side we have a
space-opera intrusion, which corresponds very roughly to a TL9-10 selection with
a few outliers (personal shields are TL11-12, but they fit the flavor). With
these vague numbers in mind, we can ditch the concept of Tech Levels completely
for our treatment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Default GURPS Tech Level rules are only useful for giving us a starting set of
gadgets to work with. In actual play, the only thing that matters is if a given
thing is “low-tech” and thus familiar to everyone, or “high-tech” and thus a
mystery to the uninitiated. How to differentiate both? With the following
advantage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tech-familiarity-10-points&quot;&gt;Tech Familiarity (10 points)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have a layman’s knowledge of the basic principles behind the advanced
technology scattered through your otherwise medieval fantasy world. You
understand why it isn’t magic. You know about electricity and how it powers
high-tech devices. You grasp enough of the high-tech design aesthetic to easily
spot a device’s charging port or battery, its control surfaces (be they
switches, triggers, or touchpads), its information displays, and its business
end even if you don’t know what the thing actually &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt;. You can identify the
high-tech civilization’s writing even though you can’t read it, and you can
identify its iconography for “danger”. You can also recognize hazards like
exposed live wires, recognize which type of power cell goes into a device, and
plug it in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a form of Unusual Background that makes you immune to the sort of
amusing accident which plagues other low-tech explorers confronted with
high-tech devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, Tech Familiarity is a pre-requisite for learning high-tech
skills, and the language of the high-tech civilization (if any). With this
advantage, you can spend points on those things normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is quite similar to High TL from the core book, but much cheaper. The
reason is that paying 30-35 points in High TL to get the same benefits is way
too expensive for a campaign in this mold. This advantage doesn’t give you any
familiarity with deeper aspects of the high-tech civilization, just what’s in
the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tech-skills&quot;&gt;Tech Skills&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skills that would require a /TL specialization in standard GURPS rules have only
two versions here: standard (no suffix) and “/Tech”. That way, you don’t need to
change anything about how you write down a standard “medievalish” character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two specialties don’t overlap at all: they don’t default to each other, and
can’t be used at all across the “tech divide”. If you only have standard
Lockpicking, you can’t open a high-tech door with a magnetic lock. If you only
have Lockpicking/Tech, you can’t open low-tech mechanical locks with
old-fashioned picks, tough you might be able to operate a machine that does it
for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-tech weapons are usually firearms of beam weapons - the skills to operate
them properly are always “/Tech” skills. High-Tech &lt;em&gt;melee&lt;/em&gt; weapons are a
possible exception to the “no defaults” rule above, though the GM would need to
rule on each case:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons that use the same skill as their low-tech counterparts can be used
normally by anyone if the only difference is in their construction (such as a
superfine or hyperdense blade). If they have some additional feature that
requires power (such as a vibroblade or shock baton) then the character has a -2
penalty to use that feature unless they have Tech Familiarity. If they require
an exclusive skill to operate (like a force sword or monowire whip) then that
skill has the “/Tech” suffix. You might be able to get away with a default to a
low-tech skill here, but the only way to improve on that is to buy Tech
Familiarity and the high-tech skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ultra-tech-gear&quot;&gt;Ultra-Tech Gear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the character stuff out of the way, we can talk about the goodies! As I
mentioned above, one advantage of GURPS is that it has entire books of high- and
ultra-tech gadgets that can be plugged straight into your fantasy
campaigns. Therefore, we don’t need to talk about how to stat this stuff up at
all! What we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need is talk about the effects it’s going to have on your
campaign, which in turn will aid you in selecting which items to include.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-much-is-this-stuff-worth&quot;&gt;How much is this stuff worth?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vital question in the dungeon fantasy genre! Going more or less by the book,
high-tech items should be worth roughly 30 times their list price in a dungeon
fantasy setting. That makes even a relatively innocuous gadget into a major
piece of loot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem a bit too much for a dungeon fantasy setting where magic and
magic items are relatively common, but I think it kinda makes sense. Ultra-tech
items are going to be a lot rarer than magic items, particularly in settings
where they come from that single crashed spaceship. They work regardless of the
local mana and sanctitiy levels. And they can be enchanted! These are exactly
the same reasons why a suit of fine plate armor costs more than a standard suit
enchanted with Lighten 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: A superfine broadword would cost $3600 in its native ultra-tech
society. Recovered from a crashed spaceship in a dungeon fantasy setting, it’s
worth $108,000!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sword gives a +2 bonus to damage and a (2) armor divisor. The closest
“low-tech” equivalent would be a very fine sword with a Penetrating Weapon
enchantment, worth $17,000, almost ten times cheaper. Even if all the bonuses
were from magic, it would still cost only $25,600. However, the superfine blade
will lose none of its functionality in a low- or no-mana zone, and it could be
enchanted with the same magic as the low-tech sword to become even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think that this is too much, you could say that the value of
ultra-tech gear is capped by the value of magic items with similar
properties. The sword from the example would be worth $17,000 then. Gear that
has no magical equivalent might still use the “uncapped” price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;timeworn-gear&quot;&gt;Timeworn Gear&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One concept from Pathfinder that’s useful to borrow is that of timeworn
items. In Barrier Peaks-style setups, most of the high-tech stuff the PCs come
across has been sitting around in derelict ruins for a very long time; even if
it was very well-built, it might not have withstood the passage of the ages
intact. To model that, we introduce the following equipment modifier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeworn&lt;/strong&gt;: This can be applied to any high-tech armor, weapon, or device that
requires power or ammunition to function. These items can’t be recharged. After
whatever reserves they contain when found are used up, they’ll break down and
become useless. They may also have other quirks arising from their almost-broken
state at the GM’s discretion. Divide final price by 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;weapons-and-armor&quot;&gt;Weapons and Armor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weapons and armor deserve special mention because Dungeon Fantasy is a
combat-heavy genre, and this combat has a very specific “feel” to it. Therefore,
high-tech combat gear will have an outsize impact on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baseline Dungeon Fantasy suggests that PCs should have a maximum total DR of
about 15, as anything more than that will make them invulnerable to too many
monster attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PC damage also has some upper bounds. Spellcasters with missile spells and a
spellcasting talent of 6 can do a maximum of 18d damage, though that requires
enough setup to only be possible about once per fight, and not on all
fights. The maximum amount of “at-will” melee and ranged damage a PC can do is
equivalent to about 7d per attack&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing ultra-tech armor into the game almost certainly means you’re going
to exceed the DR cap. Even non-combat safety gear at these tech levels has as
much DR as low-tech plate, while being much lighter. Proper combat armor is much
tougher. Most of the published DF enemies will have trouble getting past the DR
of a PC in full ultra-tech armor with their physical attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, high-tech weapons can change the shape of combat in your
campaign. Dungeon Fantasy usually considers melee to be the main event and
ranged combat to be a specialist niche, but if guns and beam weapons are common
these two are going to swap places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultra-tech melee and ranged weapons can also allow PCs to approach or exceed the
upper damage bounds described above much more easily. Both “boundaries” are
roughly equivalent to rolling 7d of damage per attack. A force sword does 8d; a
laser rifle does 6d, and can can fire many more shots per turn than a bow with
no penalty. Both of those have armor divisors too, which make enemy DR become
much less of an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step when addressing these issues is to carefully consider which items
are available. What do you want your campaign’s new DR cap to be? What is the
highest armor divisor you’re comfortable with? What sort of maximum damage do
you want your PCs to do with a melee or ranged attack they can use every second?
And, to quote Mister Torgue from Borderlands 2: EXPLOSIONS?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second step is to consider the same thing from the side of the opposition:
what’s the highest DR and damage you estimate &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; will be able to routunely
bring to the table? The gear available to the PCs should give them a chance to
match those figures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then safely remove anything that exceeds your new planned limits. That
will end up giving you a pretty good set of guidelines for what the ultra-tech
culture and their ruins look like. A civilian medical lab infested with
non-sapient monsters and low-tech looters might have plenty of medkits and
wonder drugs, but no weapon heavier than a couple of timeworn electrolasers and
some scalpels the thief can use as superfine daggers. For a military base filled
with killer robots and with a tank at the end as a boss fight, the sky is the
limit, though those anti-tank weapons might all be timeworn if you don’t want
the PCs using them outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The article itself includes a section titled “The Sociological
Ramifications are Appalling”. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A ST 20 Knight with Weapon Master and a halberd can easily attack twice
every turn and do 3d+13 per attack. This is theoretically possible right out
of character creation if your knight is a half-ogre. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A ST 20 Scout with Weapon Master and Strongbow might be able to shoot once
per turn and do about 4d+10 per shot. This particular boundary is hard to
reach, so your highest “at-will” ranged damage will probably be less than
that. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Gaj</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-gaj.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A gaj perched on a desert rock.

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book opens this entry by that the wastelands of Athas “sometimes spawn
monsters so terrible not even the merciful can permit them to live”. Cheery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illustration makes me think a gaj is what you get when you mix a mind flayer
with a beetle. These aberrations have human-level intelligence, strong
telepathic powers, and a taste for the flesh and fear of sapient
creatures. They’re too anti-social to practice infiltration like mind flayers
sometimes do, but there’s still a lot about them that’s familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaj dwell in extensive burrow networks that technically form a community, but
they rarely interact with each other. They’ll band together to defend their
home, but they mostly hunt alone or in mated pairs. They attack their prey with
their claws and mandibles, and with invasive telepathy focused through their
feathery antennae. Once a gaj has a firm grip on a victim, the touch of those
antennae will rapidly disassemble the creature’s mind and use it to fuel further
psychic assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain specimens mutate to assume a sort of leadership role in a gaj
community. Their powers specialize on inflicting pain, and they take upon
themselves the job of keeping victims captive in the burrow as dominated slaves
and/or reserve rations for lean times. These Pain Tyrants are one of the few
things that can get a whole burrow together for a bigger hunt or a raid against
a settlement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; lean times, when gaj cannot find new victims and have already
devoured all of their captives, they’ll turn on each other - even their own
mates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, just as gaj like to hunt other sapients, so are they hunted in
return. They’re very popular in the arena, so those ubuquitous slavers often
mount expeditions to find and capture them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaj are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts with a ground speed of 6, a burrow speed
of 3, Darkvision, and Tremorsense 5. Their signature trait is &lt;strong&gt;Warding Shell&lt;/strong&gt;,
which gives them +2 to defenses against any creature marking them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the stat blocks here are Chaotic Evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gaj-mindhunter&quot;&gt;Gaj Mindhunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the typical specimen, so named to distinguish it from the Pain
Tyrant. Mindhunters are Level 8 Elite Controllers with 172 HP. Their basic
attack is a bite with their &lt;strong&gt;Mandibles&lt;/strong&gt;, which grab on a hit. Once the
mindhunter has a victim in its jaws, it can only use this attack against it, and
not against others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;strong&gt;Invasive Presence&lt;/strong&gt; has no such restrictions. It’s targets one or two
creatures within Range 10, deals psychic damage on a hit, and pushes 1
square. There’s also &lt;strong&gt;Mind Wrench&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), which targets a creature
within a Close Burst 3 and dominates on a hit (save ends). Each time the target
fails the save, the mindhunter’s grabbed victim takes 2d6 psychic damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, once per round, the mindhunter can use its &lt;strong&gt;Feathery Probe&lt;/strong&gt;
on the grabbed victim. On a hit this deals light psychic damage, 5 ongoing
psychic damage, and dazes (save ends). If the target is already taking ongoing
psychic damage, that damage increases by 5. Yes, repeated hits with this attack
will result in more and more ongoing damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this paints us a picture of the mindhunter’s preferred tactics: choose a
victim to bite and grab, get away from the PCs, and keep using Invasive Presence
and Mind Wrench to keep them busy while they nom on the victim with Feathery
Probe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gaj-pain-tyrant&quot;&gt;Gaj Pain Tyrant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pain Tyrants are considerably stronger than mindhunters, being Level 13 Elite
Artillery with the Leader tag and 200 HP. Its &lt;strong&gt;Mandibles&lt;/strong&gt; have no special
effects other than damage. Its ranged basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Shriek&lt;/strong&gt; with
range 20, that targets 1-2 creatures, and on a hit deals psychic damage and
dazes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less often they can use &lt;strong&gt;Agonizing Insight&lt;/strong&gt;, an Area Burst 2 Within 20 with a
lot of complicated effects. This weaponized anxiety attack inflicts 20 psychic
damage on a hit (save ends). Whenever the target takes this ongoing damage, each
of its allies within 3 squares also takes 5 psychic damage. So, if it hits 3
PCs, in the next round each of them is going to take a total of 30 psychic
damage if they stay together: 20 from the main effect, 10 from splash damage. It
recharges when the tyrant scores a critical hit with Phrenic Probe (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt; the attack also makes each enemy inside the burst grant combat
advantage for a turn even if they weren’t hit by the main attack. It also lets
allies in the burst use a free action to either shift 1 square or move half
their speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against a dazed target, the Pain Tyrant can use &lt;strong&gt;Phrenic Probe&lt;/strong&gt; as a 1/round
minor action. This is a version of the mindhunter’s Feathery Probe that has
range 20! Finally, &lt;strong&gt;Vicious Goad&lt;/strong&gt; lets an ally within 20 squares move its
speed and make a basic attack against an enemy of the tyrant’s choice as a free
action. The ally is then dazed for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the most common gaj encounter in the wilderness is a pair of
mindhunters. A Pain Tyrant leading a larger group is also possible, but in this
case I’d recommend making the accompanying mindhunters into regulars of a
slightly lower level than their boss. Enslaved humanoids can round out the
group. And you can also find mindhunters being used as arena fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These seem to be very tricky to fight.&lt;/p&gt;
