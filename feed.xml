        <title>The Guns of Wolfenstein, Part 01</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing a lot of Wolfenstein games these past few days. There’s
something cathartic about unapologetically fighting Nazis. I first did it to
de-stress, and then to celebrate the results of our most recent election (go
Lula!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since I do occasionally want to post something here that’s not Let’s Read
the Monster Manual, I decided to talk a bit about the various guns you use to
kill Nazis in all of these games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re dealing with two separate continuities here: one that starts with Return
to Castle Wolfenstein (2001) and another that starts with Wolfenstein: The New
Order (2014). You could, if you’re so inclined, include both of them in the
GURPS Infinite Worlds framework. I’d call then Wolfenstein-1 and Wolfenstein-2
respectively, though I guess Infinity might call the latter Reich-6 at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll cover the stuff that appears in Return to Castle
Wolfenstein (2001), AKA the Wolfenstein-1 setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;game-overview&quot;&gt;Game Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a flashier remake of Wolfenstein 3D, the game that more or less started
the FPS genre back in 1992. It’s the first game in the franchise to have a more
fleshed out story wrapped around its gameplay, with voiced dialogue and
cutscenes elaborating on the simpler “you must escape the castle and kill Nazis”
plot of the 1992 game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game takes place in a pulpier version of WWII, where the Nazis are working
on a large variety of scary secret projects and the OSA (a joint Allied spy
agency) is sending agents to stop them from hitting the field. The player
character, as always, is William “B. J.” Blazkowicz. He gets sent along with a
British agent to Castle Wolfenstein to find more about these projects, they get
captured, and the game starts with Blazko’s escape attempt and moves on to
thwarting those projects to the Allies can win the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two sinister things going on here: an attempt by the Thule society to
resurrect ancient evil undead knights, and a mad science lab working to build
cyborg supersoldiers. The final boss is, of course, a bunch of cyborg
supersoldiers possessed by the spirits of ancient evil undead knights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;historical-weapons&quot;&gt;Historical Weapons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolfenstein-1 is mostly a pulpier version of WWII, so a lot of the weapons we
see are historical and present on GURPS High-Tech. Though sometimes you’ll start
a level with some Allied weapons issued by the OSA, the vast majority of the
time you’ll be using captured German hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OSA-issue weapons include the &lt;strong&gt;Colt M1911A1&lt;/strong&gt; pistol (p. HT99), the &lt;strong&gt;Thompson
M1&lt;/strong&gt; submachine gun (p. HT122), and the &lt;strong&gt;Enfield Sten Mk IIS&lt;/strong&gt; submachine gun
(p. HT 125). The integral suppressor of the Sten works according to cinematic
principles here, making it completely silent to enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, one of the “elite guard” units you face in the game also
uses Stens, because they’re meant to be sneaky and the Sten is the only
suppressed SMG in the game. The other OSA weapons are used exclusively by the
player character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German weapons include the &lt;strong&gt;Luger P08&lt;/strong&gt; pistol, (p. HT98), the &lt;strong&gt;ERMA MP40&lt;/strong&gt;
SMG (p. HT 124), the &lt;strong&gt;Mauser Kar98K&lt;/strong&gt; rifle (p. HT111), the &lt;strong&gt;Rheinmetall
FG42&lt;/strong&gt; battle rifle (p. HT 115) and the &lt;strong&gt;Panzerfaust&lt;/strong&gt; (p. HT147). The player
also uses these extensively, since every enemy drops ammo for one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FG42 is the signature weapon of the other “elite guard” unit in the game,
and has the scope described in its High-Tech entry. It’s also possible to find a
suppressor for the Luger and a variable-power scope for the Mauser, which you
can stat up using the generic rules in p. HT 156 and p. HT 158.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can occasionally also find a few &lt;strong&gt;MG42&lt;/strong&gt; machine gun (p. HT 134)
emplacements in the game. There is also a flamethrower similar to the &lt;strong&gt;M2-2&lt;/strong&gt;
(p. HT179), though this is probably the German equivalent rather than the
American version in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grenades also see use, with most of them being the German &lt;strong&gt;Stielhandgranate
24&lt;/strong&gt;, and the rest American &lt;strong&gt;AMC Mk II&lt;/strong&gt; models. Both are on p. HT190-191.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fictional-weapons&quot;&gt;Fictional Weapons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of pulpy arms research going on here on both sides, so we also get
to see some weapons that don’t exist in reality. We’ll cover these in a bit more
detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;snooper-rifle&quot;&gt;Snooper Rifle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a prototype sniper rifle issued to Blazkowicz by the OSA early in the
second mission of the game. You also find captured rifles later on while
breaking into one of the games’ many secret lab facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Snooper is the most down-to-earth of the experimental weapons here, being an
exaggerated version of the &lt;strong&gt;M3 Carbine&lt;/strong&gt; (p. HT113). Even the fancy infrared
sight is real! The biggest changes are the addition of a cinematic integral
suppressor that makes the gun completely silent, and making the infrared sight
more advanced than it really was. The one in the game has variable magnification
and requires no external batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;venom-machine-gun&quot;&gt;Venom Machine Gun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first entirely fictional weapon we encounter in the game, and the
second most unrealistic one. It’s a portable, six-barreled, belt-fed minigun. It
has relatively short barrels, a shoulder stock and rifle-style grips. There’s an
in-game document that describes it as firing 7.92mm saboted armor piercing
rounds, but the ammo for it is labeled as “12.7mm” in game. You first find the
Venom as a prototype in one of the secret labs that make up the game’s levels,
and after that it starts appearing in the hands of some enemy human
soldiers. Most of the cyborg supersoldiers you meet towards the end of the game
also carry one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll need custom stats for this one! Let’s go with the assumption that it fires
7.92mm ammo, to make it minimally plausible for it to be portable. To make it a
little easier on the user, we can further say it fires the 7.92x33mm Kurz round,
instead of the longer 7.92x57mm Mauser round from the Kar98K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-game Venom takes up to 500 rounds. These would probably be in a
disintegrating belt inside a metal can that can be worn as a backpack. The whole
thing weights around 16kg, more than the weapon itself. More reasonable 200 and
100 round belts with their smaller containers might weight in at 8 and 4kg
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll actually base the stats for it on the Minigun from page 138 of GURPS
Ultra-Tech, making the Venom a TL 7+2 weapon. The one on the table fires APDS
ammo, which is also TL 7+2 in this caliber, and has a 500-round belt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7+2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Venom&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6d+2(2) pi-&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1000/4000&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;15kg/16kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;25!&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;500(5)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;15M&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Venom requires Guns (LMG) to operate, or Guns (Longarm) with the Burst-Fire
technique if using the alternate gun skill rules from Pyramid #3/65.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tesla-gun&quot;&gt;Tesla Gun&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weapon used by the advanced cyborg supersoldiers you meet at the very end of
the game. Unlike the Venom this doesn’t bear even the tiniest resemblance to any
real gun. Pull the trigger and it fires a stream of lightning until you release
it or until it runs out of charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tesla Gun draws power from a superscience backpack battery equivalent to a
TL 9 D cell, but four times heavier. Its damage follows the same rules as the
Lightning spell: metal armor only provides DR 1, and the target must make a HT
roll with a penalty of -1 for every 2 points of injury taken from it. Failure
means they’re stunned, and must attempt an HT roll every turn in order to
recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;TL&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weapon&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Damage&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Acc&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Range&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;RoF&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Shots&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;ST&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Bulk&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;Rcl&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;7+2^&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Tesla Gun&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;4d+2 burn sur&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;600/1900&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;35kg/10kg&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;50 (5)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;18M&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;-8&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tesla Gun requires Gunner (Beam) to operate, even when carried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-much-for-these-fancy-guns&quot;&gt;How much for these fancy guns?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that I ommitted any price information for the Venom and the Tesla
Gun above. That’s because in Wolfenstein-1 they’re secret prototypes with very
limited production runs. You don’t buy them, you pry them from the hands of dead
Nazi assholes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use them on a different setting where they are available for
purchase, use the following costs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Cost&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Venom MG&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;$12.500&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Venom Ammo (100-round belt, APDS)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;$180&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Venom Ammo (100-round belt, solid)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;$60&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Tesla Gun&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;$60.000&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Tesla Battery&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;$400&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are for a setting with a tech level of 7+2. If you’re in a “plain” TL9
setting you might want to use the Minigun and Semi-Portable Electrolaser from
Ultra-tech, which have slightly better stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your setting is like Wolfenstein-1, where the overall TL is a plain 7 and
these are secret superscience prototypes, multiply all prices by 4.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Tannarukk</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-tannaruk.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one feels like an AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Edition creation, as that’s when they renamed
demons as “ta’nari”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tannarukk are engineered hybrids of orc and demon DNA, the product of rituals
performed by demon lords or ambitious mortal spellcasters. These rituals are
effectively a mass-production process, as they involve pulsing vats and can
create dozens of the creatures at once. In most cases they’re immediately put to
work as soldiers and weapons of war, though they’re extremely difficult to keep
under control unless they get “enough” opportunity to commit violence. As you
might expect, that’s a tall order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The few free tannarukk bands that exist tend to seek work as mercenaries. Free or
not, they can most often be found in the Astral Sea or Elemental Chaos, usually
fighting something. They do sometimes show up in the middle world, and they love
it because few warriors there can match their skill and resilience in combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tannarukks are Medium Elemental Humanoids with the Demon and Orc keywords. They
have Darkvision and Speed 6, along with Resist Fire 5. Their signature trait is
&lt;strong&gt;Indomitable Fury&lt;/strong&gt;, which kicks in when they drop to 0 HP for the first time
in the fight. It makes them stay at 1 HP instead and gives them +2 to attacks
and +4 to damage until the end of the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means the PCs should make sure each Tannarukk in the encounter stays down by
hitting it again before it can get a chance to take more actions. If they don’t,
they’re going to take more damage; if they do, that’s one attack that didn’t go
to a healthier monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tannarukk-marauder&quot;&gt;Tannarukk Marauder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most tannarukks conform to this stat block, which is your basic enthusiastic axe
murderer. Marauders wear hide and wield a &lt;strong&gt;greataxe&lt;/strong&gt;, and can also thrown
&lt;strong&gt;handaxes&lt;/strong&gt; at those they can’t quite reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Nimble Reaction&lt;/strong&gt; trait gives them +4 AC against opportunity attacks,
which is good because their signature move relies on fishing for them: &lt;strong&gt;Brutal
Rampage&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to move their speed and make a greataxe attack at any
point during the move. This attack gains a +5 damage bonus for each opportunity
attack made against the marauder during the move (but before the attack). The
opportunity attacks don’t need to hit, they just need to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tannarukk-steel-warrior&quot;&gt;Tannarukk Steel Warrior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bigger tannarukk that received better training and had armor riveted to
its hide. It’s a Level 18 Soldier with 177 HP. Its armor counts as plate, and it
wields a shield and a &lt;strong&gt;Longsword&lt;/strong&gt;, plus a &lt;strong&gt;Crossbow&lt;/strong&gt; for ranged attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sword marks for a turn, and the warrior can make free attacks against
enemies that ignore the mark. It can also be used in a special attack named
&lt;strong&gt;Burning Cage&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+). This melee attack targets Reflex and does heavy
fire damage. The target takes a further 5 fire damage every time it enters a
square during its turn (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tannarukk-flame-speaker&quot;&gt;Tannarukk Flame Speaker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tannarukk spellcaster whose power relies on a connection to the abyssal
flames that go into their production ritual. It’s level 17 Artillery with 129
HP and resist 10 fire, a bit higher than usual for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flame speaker fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Staff&lt;/strong&gt; in melee, and with &lt;strong&gt;fire bolts&lt;/strong&gt; at
range. It can also shoot a &lt;strong&gt;fire barrage&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) that targets up to
three creatures but does a bit less damage than the basic bolt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter, the flame speaker can summon &lt;strong&gt;Winds of Fire&lt;/strong&gt;, an area
burst attack that deals fire damage and creates a zone that lasts for the rest
of the encounter. Anyone starting their turn inside takes 10 fire damage and is
pulled 1 square towards the zone’s origin square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Indomitable Fury, the flame speaker also has &lt;strong&gt;Avenging Fire&lt;/strong&gt;,
which triggers when it hits 0 HP for the second time. It deals some automatic
fire damage to the triggering enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stat blocks take up a lot of space on the book, but they’re simpler than
they look. Each one has a solid gimmick and appropriate base stats. I guess
tannarukks are meant to be regular enemies for upper paragon PCs - stronger than
minions, but you’ll still meet a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lore-wise, I’m not sure I like them. They’re more or less D&amp;amp;D’s take on the
Uruk-Hai, I guess, but there are a lot more opponents at this level range that
feel cooler and less potentially problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Su Monster</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-su-monster.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Su Monsters have been around at least since the AD&amp;amp;D Monster Manual. This is
their 4e debut. It’s likely their lore is new to this edition. They didn’t seem
to have any in the AD&amp;amp;D book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Su Monsters are an artificial species created by the wizard Halkith to guard his
tower in the legendary Isle of Dread. In Fourth Edition, the Isle is a wandering
island in the Feywild, and as usual it’s full of very dangerous
creatures. Halkith created the first Su Monsters to guard his tower against the
place’s other inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time after that, a mysterious event caused a worldwide surge of psionic
energy. This affected Halkith’s su monsters deeply and caused them to break from
the wizard’s control. Halkith disappears from history after this - his most
likely fate is that he was eaten by his creations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wizard combined traits from both great apes and fey panthers to make these
creatures. In our narrative present they managed to spread beyond the Isle of
Dread. Their preferred habitat are tropical jungles, particularly those that
contain sources of psionic power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Su Monsters are nonsapient but cunning, and complement their natural weapons
with residual psychic powers received from the Event. Like cats, they hunt as
much for fun as for food, and kill much more prey than they can eat at
once. They bury the excess meat for later consumption, and mark these stashes
with the prey’s inedible bits (such as its carried treasure). If you find
shinies hanging off tree branches in the jungle, take care!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spellcasters and psionicists often use their power to control these creatures,
putting them to work as guard and attack animals. When free, they protect and
hunt in their chosen territories with surprisingly sophisticated tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Su Monsters are Medium Fey Beasts with ground and climb speeds of 7, as well as
the Forest Walk special ability. They have darkvision, and one of both of the
following signature abilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychic Boost&lt;/strong&gt; works like the Star Spawn ability we saw: when a su monster
hits with one of its physical attacks, it can deal bonus psychic damage as a
free action. This recharges when the creature takes psychic damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tribal Fury&lt;/strong&gt; has a very unfortunate name and allows the monster to make a
free claw attack when an ally within 3 squares is first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;su-sentinel&quot;&gt;Su Sentinel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many members of a su monster group use this stat block. Each one keeps watch
over a portion of the group’s territory, and calls the others if they spot any
prey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Su Sentinels are Level 10 Skirmishers with 107 HP. They have a &lt;strong&gt;Skirmish&lt;/strong&gt;
trait that allows them to deal 5 extra damage with their attacks if they moved
4 or more spaces this turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to basic &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; strikes, they can make a &lt;strong&gt;Flashing Talons&lt;/strong&gt;
maneuver that deals a bit less damage and, as an effect, allows them to shift 2
squares. If the targeted enemy moves to a space adjacent to the monster during
their next turn, the creature gets to make this attack against them once more
for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also use a &lt;strong&gt;Mind-Rending Bite&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+), which deals even less
basic damage but inflicts ongoing 10 psychic damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sentinels have both Su Monster signature abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;su-ambusher&quot;&gt;Su Ambusher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Su Ambushers are less physicall imposing but they hunt together, hanging out
near places that see frequent creature traffic and jumping out all at once to
carry prey away. They’re Level 11 Minion Soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a basic &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack that does minion-tier damage, but instead of
using that they’re going to rely on &lt;strong&gt;Seize Prey&lt;/strong&gt;. This lets them move their
speed and make a claw attack at any point along the move. If they hit, they pull
the target alongside them the rest of the move, and do not provoke opportunity
attacks from it. This is excellent for getting defenders out of the way or
briging squishies closer to danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambushers have Fury, but they replace Psychic Boost with &lt;strong&gt;Grasping Claws&lt;/strong&gt;,
which allow them to make one last claw attack when they hit 0 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;su-alpha&quot;&gt;Su Alpha&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Su Alphas are larger and more powerful specimens who gained some status within
their group by repeatedly proving they can beat up their puny relatives. Smaller
groups have only one alpha, but larger ones might have several. They are Level
12 Brutes with 149 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphas fight with &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Backhand Slams&lt;/strong&gt;, the latter of which do less
damage but target Fortitude and push the target 1 square. They can also emit a
&lt;strong&gt;Su Howl&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 3 vs. Will) which deals psychic damage and renders its
targets vulnerable 5 to all damage (save ends). On a miss, the target takes half
damage and is vulnerable for a turn. This recharges wherever the alpha takes
psychic damage. They possess both signature abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s another carnivorous ape monster in a book that already has too many of
them. The lore and mechanics seem to disagree with each other on whether su
monsters are sapient. The stats say they are Int 2 beasts, but the lore keeps
saying they organize in “tribes”, a term I’ve avoided using here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanics themselves are mildly interesting, but I don’t like them enough to
use them paired with this lore.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Star Spawn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Star Spawn made their debut in the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2022/02/03/star-spawn.html&quot;&gt;Monster Manual 2&lt;/a&gt; along with a pretty
awesome chunk of lore that’s also tied to star pact warlocks and the Far
Realm. You can see it all on the link. This entry adds a bit more lore, new star
spawn, and a surprise epic boss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lore in this entry confirms some of the most terrible questions we had in
the MM2. Yes, if you travel far enough in space you do end up in the Far
Realm. Yes, there are things watching across this divide, and some of them are
perceived by the people of the middle world as stars. And yes, some of them have
hostile designs upon the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allabar, the Opener of the Way, is one of these, and it travels across the
universe inciting its fellow stars to send their spawn into the world. Its
wanderings are not random, but filled with terrible purpose. Some warlocks claim
Allabar and its allies are at war with the world itself, and they call this the
Forgotten War because it’s much less noticeable than the Dawn War was but no
less significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The star spawn presented here are all mid-to-high epic tier threats, making them
a lot stronger than the paragon-tier spawn from the MM2. All of them have the
aberrant origin and possess darkvision, but the specifics vary a lot between
individual stat blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spawn-of-ulban&quot;&gt;Spawn of Ulban&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-ulban.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ulban is a blue-white star whose intense glow affects mortal minds, disrupting
their cognition and robbing them of the ability to recognize danger. Ulban’s
influence starts ill-thought rebellions and prevents divinations of any sort
from working. Its spawn fall to the earth as meteors, and their presence makes
mortals unable to distinguish friend from foe. They also break the “no
tentacles” streak for this type of monster, as you can see in the illustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spawn of Ulban are Medium Aberrant Humanoids, and Level 26 Controllers with 241
HP. They have a speed of 8. They’re immune to domination, and every time they’re
iht by a power that would dominate them, they dominate the attacker instead! And
this is a (save ends) condition even if the one from the attack wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spawn’s basic attack is the &lt;strong&gt;Bluefire Strike&lt;/strong&gt; (vs. Reflex), which causes
both cold and fire damage, and dazes for a turn. It can also use a &lt;strong&gt;Touch of
Strife&lt;/strong&gt; (vs. Will) instead, dealing psychic damage and forcing the target to
make a melee or ranged basic attack against a creature of the spawn’s
choice. When it hits with either of these attacks, it can apply a &lt;strong&gt;Psychic
Boost&lt;/strong&gt; as a free action, dealing an extra chunk of psychic damage. This
recharges every time the spawn takes psychic damage, so while it’s not
&lt;em&gt;resistant&lt;/em&gt; to this damage type you still don’t want to use it against the
spawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less often, the spawn can produce a &lt;strong&gt;Ripple of Betrayal&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 1
vs. Will, recharge 5+) which deals psychic damage and dominates those it hits
(save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, the spawn can use &lt;strong&gt;Far Realm Reflection&lt;/strong&gt; to form an
eldritch bond with a creature it can see. Whenever that creature shifts, the
spawn can immediately shift an equal number of squares. This lasts until the end
of the encounter, or until the spawn switches targets by using the power
again. An excellent power to use on an ally that can shift long distances, or
even on a PC that can do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spawn of Ulban wants to get in close and stay there, since its attacks are
all melee or close bursts. It’s extremely effective against parties with lots of
psionic PCs, or against those that have lots of Essentials martial
characters. The best way to fight it is to keep your distance and hit it with
non-psychic, non-dominating attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;emissary-of-caiphon&quot;&gt;Emissary of Caiphon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-caiphon.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caiphon is a purple star that can always be found near the horizon, sometimes
even during the day. It presents itself as a helpful guide star, but will
sometimes betray those who rely on it, leading them down tragic paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emissary of Caiphon is often employed in these betrayals. It’s the most
human-looking of all star spawn, and it mimics the tactics of its patrons by
posing as a guide or a prophet. Its “wise and helpful” advice usually leads to a
lot suffering and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emissary is a Medium Aberrant Humanoid, and a Level 28 Controller with the
Leader tag and 257 HP. It projects an &lt;strong&gt;Aura of Ruin&lt;/strong&gt; (2) that inflicts a -2
penalty to saves, and whenever it’s hit by an attack that would blind it, it
blinds the attacker instead (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the Emissary’s powers mess with the saving throw mechanic, but it
lacks the ability to inflict (save ends) conditions by itself. Be sure to pair
it with plenty of monsters who can do that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Touch of Despair&lt;/strong&gt; that deals light physical damage and
inflicts an extra 20 damage the first time the target fails a save before the
start of the emissary next turn. It’s nifty, but it’s for emercencies only. The
creature prefers to stay far away and use its ranged attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blinded By Greed&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10 vs. Will) deals light psychic damage, slides the
target 2 squares, and forces them to make a melee basic attack against a target
of the emissary’s choice (“Give me that! It’s mine!”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blinded By Need&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10 vs. Will) deals standard psychic damage, and
allows the emissary to choose one of the target’s allies. For the next turn, the
target is marked by that ally, and everyone except the chosen ally is invisible
to the target. This doesn’t &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; the target and the ally to fight each
other, but it makes it hard for either of them to do anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As minor actions, the emissary can use &lt;strong&gt;Deceptive Veil&lt;/strong&gt; to disguise itself as
a Medium or Small humanoid, with a DC 40 for people to see through the
illusion. It can also target someone with an &lt;strong&gt;Invocation of Calamity&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged
5 vs. Will), which on a hit makes the target fail all of their saves during the
next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For triggered actions, it has the same &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Boost&lt;/strong&gt; as the Spawn of Ulban,
this time applying to tis Blinded By Need/Greed powers. And when it dies,
&lt;strong&gt;Foretelling the Doom&lt;/strong&gt; targets an enemy suffering from a (save ends) condition
and inflicts a -5 penalty on all saves against it until one succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serpent-of-nihal&quot;&gt;Serpent of Nihal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-nihal.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nihal, the Serpent Star, is a reddish celestial body that can’t stay still. It
travels a random snaking route around the point it was supposed to occupy in the
sky according to all standard calculations. That’s why it received this
epithet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Serpents of Nihal first came through the world shortly before the fall of
the ancient empire of Az-Kiral, which dedicated itself to the worship of
Zehir. Its leaders grew ever more ambitious and soon they craved more power than
the snake god was willing to offer. So they sought out a new source of Snek
Power, and found it in Nihal. They opened a portal to the star thinking they
would be able to access this power. What happened instead was that countless
Serpents of Nihal poured through, and destroyed the empire in a matter of
days. They still wander the known cosmos today, and I guess sometimes Allabar
opens new rifts to let more through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serpents are Medium Aberrant Beasts, and Level 29 Minion Lurkers with a ground
speed of 7. They’re only partially present in reality, and keep blinking in and
out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that, despite being minions, they have &lt;strong&gt;Resist 20 to all
damage&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, even untyped. You need to deal 21 or more damage with one strike
to take them out. It’s not that hard for late epic PCs, but it’s also not 100%
guaranteed, so they have more staying power than your typical minion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serpents attack with &lt;strong&gt;mindbites&lt;/strong&gt;, which deal psychic damage and can interfere
with concentration and psionic power usage: if 2 or more of the serpent’s allies
are adjacent to the target, the bite deals extra damage and prevents the target
from spending action points or power points (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an enemy misses the serpent, it can &lt;strong&gt;Depart Reality&lt;/strong&gt;, removing itself from
play for a turn an re-appearing in adjacent to an enemy within 20 squares of its
original location. It can also do this exact same thing when it rolls initiative
with the &lt;strong&gt;Sudden Reality Warp&lt;/strong&gt; ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allabar-opener-of-the-way&quot;&gt;Allabar, Opener of the Way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-allabar.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, you read that right. This is not a star spawn, it’s a &lt;em&gt;star&lt;/em&gt;. Allabar is
here to serve as the end boss for a campaign focused on the Forgotten War, which
would likely feature the PCs facing and unraveling the plans of increasingly
powerful aberrant creatures and star spawn until Allabar itself decides to
personally kill them. As the lore implies, Allabar is not the only eldritch star
who wants to mess with the world, but it’s the most consciously malicious one
and it acts as instigator and enabler to the others. Eliminating Allabar would
effectively end the threat posed by its fellows and their respective star spawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting the lore in astronomical terms would make Allabar similar to a rogue
planet, a planet without a star that moves across the universe. The similarity
is only superficial, of course, because pretty much nothing else about the
Opener of the Way is in any way scientific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allabar is presented here as a Gargantuan Aberrant Animate. Those who feel even
Gargantuan is too small for a planetary entity might instead say this is an
avatar of Allabar, the thing it sends through a portal to personally fight the
PCs. When it dies, the star winks out from the sky. Or you can take a page from
Atropus in Elder Evils, and have the actual body of Allabar be the
dungeon/battlefield on which you fight its avatar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Allabar is a Level 30 Solo Soldier with 1100 HP. It has ground and
flight speeds of 6, with Hover. As a planet, it projects a &lt;strong&gt;Gravity Well&lt;/strong&gt; that
acts as a 20-square wide aura. This plus its Gargantuan size pretty much mean it
covers the entire battle map. Anyone who starts their turn inside the field gets
pulled a variable number of squares depending on how much HP Allabar currently
has. It starts at 1 square, and doubles for every 25% of its HP that are missing
(at 25% or less total HP, it’s 8 squares).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being covered with eyes, Allabar has &lt;strong&gt;All-Around Vision&lt;/strong&gt;, and can’t be
flanked. Its &lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Fury&lt;/strong&gt; also gives it an extra standard action per turn
while it’s bloodied, even when it’s dazed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combat, the Opener of the Way projects Reach 4 &lt;strong&gt;Tentacles&lt;/strong&gt; to attack, which
deal light physical damage and restrain for a turn on a hit. It can use them in
a &lt;strong&gt;Triple Attack&lt;/strong&gt; to strike three times in a standard action, and it can
enhance a tentacle attack with a &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Boost&lt;/strong&gt; similar to that of the star
spawn in this entry. Aside from the boost recharging when Allabar takes psychic
damage, it also recharges when the star succeeds with its &lt;strong&gt;Devour Body&lt;/strong&gt;
attack. This Close Burst 1 vs. Fortitude targets creatures who are at 0 HP or
lower. On a hit, it kills the target and pulls it inside Allabar. It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;
target dead allies, but it’s also excellent for making PCs exercise those “when
you die” abilities they surely have by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very interesting attack is &lt;strong&gt;Wrath of the Forsaken World&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast
5 vs. Fortitude, recharge 5+), which deals psychic damage and causes each target
to sprout a hostile tentacle (save ends). While the tentacle is there, it deals
an automatic 20 damage to any target that ends their turn within 2 squares of
the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, you know, no big deal, the Opener can use &lt;strong&gt;Unravel Essence&lt;/strong&gt;
(melee 4 vs. Fortitude), which inflicts 20 ongoing damage on a hit (save
ends). On the first failed save, this increases to 25. On the second, the target
also becomes weakened and insubstantial. On the third, the target drops to 0 HP
if its HP was still positive. A successful save at any point halts the process
and clears all related conditions. This recharges whenever there are no
creatures affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, when someone hits Allabar with an attack, it can cause &lt;strong&gt;Psychic
Feedback&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction, automatically dazing the attacker (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allabar is very intelligent and will work to maximize its advantages, abusing
its flight and superior reach, and focusing fire make them drop to 0 HP quickly
so they can be devoured. And if your level 30 PCs are cocky because this end
boss is “only” level 30, add a few Emissaries of Caiphon to make it impossible
for them to pass the many saves imposed by the Opener of the Way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awesome continues! This entry does return to the old standby of “tentacles”,
but the monsters are still pretty evocative and their mechanics
interesting. Allabar reminds me of Atropus, from Elder Evils, but it’s has more
of an aberrant/psychic theme instead of Atropus’ undead/necrotic leanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Opener of the Way is the fourth and last epic boss to be found in this
book. The previous ones were Imix, Lolth, and Ogrémoch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Spider</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only have monstrous spiders been in the game since the beginning, they’ve
been on every monster book we read so far. The MM3 is no exception in this
case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the Web Walk trait was a &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2021/01/05/spider.html&quot;&gt;Monster Vault&lt;/a&gt; innovation. The spiders
in the MM3 don’t have it, but it would make sense for them to do so. They do
already use fixed math, like the other monsters in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All spiders here have a climb speed equal to their ground speed, with the Spider
Climb keyword to signal that they can also walk on ceilings. They also have
Tremorsense 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ambush-spider&quot;&gt;Ambush Spider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to go back to basics, and you can’t get any more basic than
this. These Medium natural spiders behave much like mundane trapdoor spiders,
using webs to camouflage their hidey-holes and charging out of them to bite and
inject venom into their prey. As Level 2 Lurkers with 28 HP, they’re likely the
first giant spider any group of adventures is going to face. I’m surprised
something like this only showed up in the MM3. Their speed is a breezy 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spider’s &lt;strong&gt;Camouflage&lt;/strong&gt; trait allows it to hide when it has only partial
cover or concealment. Its basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;, but it turns into a
&lt;strong&gt;Venomous Bite&lt;/strong&gt; if made against a creature the spider is hidden from. This
does the same damage and can be used in a charge. It also slows the target and
inflicts 5 ongoing poison damage (save ends). This worsens to immobilized after
the first failed save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spiderling&quot;&gt;Spiderling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spiderlings are immature giant spiders, merely Small in size. This is a generic
stat block that can be used to represent youngsters of any of the spider species
presented here or elsewhere. They’re Level 4 Minion Skirmishers with Speed 6 and
a basic bite attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack deals only 2 poison damage, but it also gives poison vulnerability 5
to the target for a turn. If the target is already vulnerable to poison their
vulnerability increases by 2 instead. This means that multiple spiderling bites
on the same victim add up very fast, particularly if the adults join in at the
end. You can vary their level based on the expected level of the adult
specimens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feyspitter-spider&quot;&gt;Feyspitter Spider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spider native to the Feywild produces a venom laced with psychedelic
fairy-tale qualities. Aside from the usual physiological damage, it also forces
its victims to dance uncontrolably! Over time, feyspitter hunting grounds come
to look like clearings where the vegetation has been stomped flat by all the
dancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feyspitters are Medium Fey Beasts and Level 7 Controllers with 80 HP and a Speed
of 6. Their &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; deals physical damage and inflicts 5 ongoing poison damage
(save ends). Each time the victim fails a save, the spider can slide them 3
squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also use &lt;strong&gt;Poison Spittle&lt;/strong&gt; to spray their venom in a Close
Blast 3. This deams 10 ongoing poison damage on everyone it hits, with the same
sliding effect on each failed save. Finally, if hit in melee, feyspitters can
use a &lt;strong&gt;Fey Leap&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) to teleport 3 squares as an interrupt. Yes,
this means they can jump out of melee range and negate any damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lolths-reaver&quot;&gt;Lolth’s Reaver&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another epic level spider directly associated with Lolth. These spiders don’t
exist in the wild. Instead, they’re bred by Lolth’s worshippers and fed the
blood of elves, eladrin and angels from an early age. Their upbringing makes
them sapient and Chaotic Evil. They commonly serve as mounts for Abyssal Drow,
and can also be found as pets and guardians in Lolth’s mightiest temples
elsewhere in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reavers are Large Elemental Beasts with the Mount and Spider keywords. They’re
Level 25 Brutes with 287 HP. They have a ground speed of 8, but their Climb
speed is only 6. Their mount trait is &lt;strong&gt;Web Saddle&lt;/strong&gt;, which prevents their rider
from being involuntarily dismounted by forced movement. I never even knew this
was a possibility for anyone else, so I find this very interesting. Enough PCs
have easy access to forced movement that staying mounted might very well be a
problem for an enemy rider in most situations. Not here, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reavers fight with their extremely venomous &lt;strong&gt;bites&lt;/strong&gt;, which deal light physical
damage and inflict 20 ongoing poison damage (save ends). They can shoot
&lt;strong&gt;Grasping Threads&lt;/strong&gt; at range, which deal no damage but pull the target 5
squares and restrain them (save ends). Each failed saving throw causes the
reaver to pull the target an additional 5 squares. There is no hard limit on the
number of targets that can be restrained in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter the reaver can perform a &lt;strong&gt;Web Leap&lt;/strong&gt;, jumping 8 squares
without provoking opportunity attacks and spreaying a Close Blast 3 with sticky
webs when they land. This does heavy physical damage, knocks its targets prone,
and prevents them from standing up (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spider-webs&quot;&gt;Spider Webs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a monster, but a side box with example terrain features based on
spider webs. All of the spiders in this entry and most of the ones in previous
books are web-spinners, so these should see heavy usage in arachnid-themed
dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These hazards have variable DCs and attack rolls based on their level, which
should be similar to that of the overall encounter. The more badass the spider,
the more badass its webs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Sheets&lt;/strong&gt; are nearly invisible vertical webs, usually placed across
passages and corridors. Spotting them requires a Perception test against the
hard DC for their level. When someone enters their space, they attack the
victim’s Reflex and immobilize them (save ends). A close or area fire attack
destroys the whole web, a melee fire attack destroys one square of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cobwebs&lt;/strong&gt; are thick and opaque sheets of webbing covering walls, floors, and
ceilings. Spiders use these for concealment, hiding behind them until it’s time
to burst out and strike. They provide total concealment, and spiders can usually
perceive enemies through them using tremorsense. They might also count as
difficult terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re starting to repeat ourselves a bit with all these spiders, but it’s nice
to see a low-level example. I also really liked the Feyspitter for its dancing
venom.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orchard of Time</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting dream recently that gave me what I think is a neat idea for
a dungeon location: The Orchard of Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s started out as your standard divine orchard, a bit like the Garden of the
Hesperides. It was owned and operated by a powerful spirit or minor deity, and
its trees gave fruit that ranged from “mundane but high-quality” to “outright
miraculous” the further in you went. If you got to the very center, you could
harvest the Peaches of Immortality or something equally awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something happened to the Orchard’s original owners and they left, abandoning
the place. Monstrous fauna from the surrounding regions moved in and either
overwhelmed the previous guardians or entered some sort of symbiosis with
them. These new monsters found ample food in the trees of the Orchard, whose
energies mutated them to be larger and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, a powerful arch-wizard found the Orchard’s location and decided to go
for the Peaches. This extremely arrogant individual was sure he would succeed
where all others have failed. After all, the others weren’t him! He armed
himself with his best spells and his best magic items, and teleported to the
Orchard’s entrance (can’t teleport into it from outside). Then he boldly strode
past the gate, and cast his most powerful magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a custom spell that would stop time everywhere in the Orchard except
for an area five meters or so in radius around the wizard himself. The idea was
that, with time stoped, the archmage could just walk up to the really good trees
in the center while dodging the place’s many inhabitants. If he needed to remove
any of them, he could bring them into the “active time” circle and use his other
magic to handle them one individual or small group at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the wizard’s hubris got the better of him at exactly the worst
time. Maybe he had miscalculated when creating the spell, or maybe he made a
critical error when casting it. The fact is that our wizard just
kinda… exploded, leaving behind only his ornate metal staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the spell itself worked exactly as planned. Even better in fact, as
the same error that deleted our wizard made it last forever. It’s centered on
the wizard’s staff, which stands planted on the ground just inside the Orchard’s
entrance gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layout-and-hazards&quot;&gt;Layout and Hazards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orchard is located in a hidden valley and is bordered by tall forested
mountains. The climate can range from temperate to tropical depending on what
kind of fruit you want it to contain. As mentioned above, vestigial divine wards
prevent people from finding it with divination or from teleporting into it from
outside. It can still be found via good old-fashioned research, as its location
is recorded in ancient religious texts and in the unfortunate wizard’s own
notes. The wizard has also helpfully dispelled any magical defenses that
prevented people from just walking through the main gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orchard of Time was a little overgrown from its period of abandonment, but
still retains its characteristic layout. There are many trees but they’re spaced
far apart. Cobbled paths wind their way among them. Grass and other wild plants
reach up to a human’s knees between the trees and paths. This space used to be
taken up by a lawn and flower beds, but these have been overwhelmed by native
plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that despite covering a very large area, the Orchard has excellent
sight lines and a clearly navigable layout. You can see a good deal of its
significant landmarks from the entrance gate and it’s impossible to get lost
inside. These excellent sight lines work against intruders such as the PCs,
because they allow the many, many monsters and guardians that live here to see
them from far away. These creatures are all hostile, territorial, and generally
incapable of dialogue either because they have animal intellect or because
they’re some sort of construct. In the dream I had these monsters definitely
included a variety of Rodents of Unusual Size. There are almost more monsters
than there are fruit, and they all more or less converge on the location of any
intruders they can perceive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or they &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;, if time hadn’t stopped inside. The wizard’s staff is just
inside the entrance, and it projects a field of “normal time” in a 5-meter
radius around itself. Everything outside this bubble and inside the orchard’s
outer walls is frozen in time, and has been for a long time (decades?
centuries?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs who want to succeed where the arrogant wizard failed need to carry the staff
with them. Getting close enough to a monster that it enters the “bubble” will
unfreeze the creature, and it will imediately attack. There might be a route
that allows them to avoid most of the creatures, but not all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the copious monsters, the permanent time stop might have created
hazardous areas inside the Orchard, where space or time itself behave in harmful
ways. These might be almost impossible to detect until they’re inside the active
time bubble, which would make them reveal themselves in a dramatic fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-go-there&quot;&gt;Why go there?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious reason to delve the Orchard of Time is to get its most awesome
fruits from the big trees at the center, like the wizard wanted to do. The
Orchard might also contain buildings of interest (such as libraries or treasure
vaults), along with the bodies of ancient adventurers who tried to delve the
place before the ill-fated wizard. Some of these might be legendary themselves,
and have died carrying their equally legendary gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly alternate Orchard would have been invaded by the wizard while it was
still operational! In this case it’s going to be in pristine condition, with all
of its original guardians and security systems still in place. Even its &lt;em&gt;owners&lt;/em&gt;
will still be around, frozen in time like flies in amber. Freeing them is an
excellent goal for more heroic sorts, or at least for sorts who need the
specific help whose divine entities are able to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since those owners are frozen in time, they’re still going to be under
the impression that they’re being invaded by a cheeky wizard. And look at you,
carrying his staff around like that. Better talk fast!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the Monster Manual 3: Spawn of Kyuss</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spawn of Kyuss were introduced in the Age of Worms adventure path,
originally published in Dungeon Magazine in 2005-2006, when it was run by
Paizo. Some of Kyuss’ most powerful servants were reprinted in the Elder Evils
supplement for 3.5e, and later got conversion stats in an early 4th edition web
enhancement file. This means this is technically not the Spawn’s 4e debut, but
it is the first time we get complete lore and lower-than-epic stats for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ancient times, Kyuss was a mortal magician and a charismatic cult leader, who
led his followers to a remote jungle region in order to establish a base. There,
he found ruins from an even more ancient pre-human civilization. With the
knowledge he learned from those ruins, the cultist sacrificed his followers in a
ritual to become a giant undead demigod whose body was made out of bright green
worms. The Worm that Walks spent a long time imprisoned outside the world, but
the prophecy of the Age of Worms foretells that he will return and devour the
world in what is basically a worm-fueled zombie apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spawn of Kyuss are undead created by infecting corpses with worms plucked
from his own body. They’re easily distinguished by the wriggling mass of green
worms crawling all over them, inside and outside. They’re Kyuss’ agents in the
world and their presence presages his return. Even if the Worm’s return is not
imminent, these creatures might still be found performing some task that
furthers their patron’s interests, whether by themselves or allied with
cultists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Spawn were Kyuss’ original followers, sacrificed in that first
ritual. Making new ones is a matter of performing a simple worm transplant from
a spawn to an available body, living or dead. The ones listed here are not
particularly smart, but it’s worth remembering that &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/06/21/larva-mage.html&quot;&gt;Larva Mages&lt;/a&gt; are also
the spawn of Kyuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get three varieties of Spawn here, all suitable as threats to Paragon-tier
parties. They’re Medium Natural Animates with a Speed of 5 and Darkvision, plus
the usual undead traits: immunity to disease and poison, a resistance to
necrotic damage, and a vulnerability to radiant damage. They’re also vulnerable
to fire - it burns the worms right up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the spawn here can also transmit the Touch of Kyuss, which is basically
an infestation of evil supernatural worms. It’s treated as a Level 16 disease
resisted with Endurance (DC 25 to improve or 20 to maintain). Stage 1 makes the
victim regain only half hit points from spending healing surges, and causes them
to rise as wretches of Kyuss if they die. Stage 2 causes them to lose 2 healing
surges, and if they ever reach 0 surges they die and rise as Sons of
Kyuss. Stage 3 cuts to the chase and kills the victim right away so it can rise
as a Son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;son-of-kyuss&quot;&gt;Son of Kyuss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things look like zombies at a first glance, but they’re sapient and much
stronger. Their goal is to usually spread the “blessing” of Kyuss to as many
living people as they can. Though they’re not exactly geniuses at Int 6, they
can and will coordinate in order to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sons of Kyuss are Level 13 Brutes with 158 HP. They project a &lt;strong&gt;Fear of Worms&lt;/strong&gt;
aura which inflicts a -2 attack penalty to living creatures inside. Their basic
attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and exposes the target to the Touch of
Kyuss. It can also “shoot” &lt;strong&gt;Burrowing Worms&lt;/strong&gt; in a Close Burst 1 (recharge
5+). A hit inflicts 10 ongoing damage, increasing to 15 on the first failed save
and to 20 plus stun on the second. If someone dies from this they immediately
rise as a wretch of Kyuss (see below). The wretch must be destroyed before the
victim can be raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wretch-of-kyuss&quot;&gt;Wretch of Kyuss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An undead creature with a lower worm content than a full Son of Kyuss. It’s less
sturdy but still quite dangerous and quite contagious, being a Level 13 Minion
Brute. Its &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; deals light necrotic damage, and when it dies it bursts,
inflicting necrotic damage in a Close Burst 1 and exposing anyone hit by this
attack to the Touch of Kyuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;herald-of-kyuss&quot;&gt;Herald of Kyuss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These undead abomination were created from the bodies of angels sent by the gods
to stop the Worm that Walks. They’re Medium Immortal Animates (undead), and have
all the same traits as the other spawn. Also, they can fly at speed 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Herald is a Level 16 Artillery monster with 116 HP. They have the same Fear
of Worms aura as the Son, plus a &lt;strong&gt;Writhing Host&lt;/strong&gt; aura of the same size that
deals 10 necrotic damage to enemies caught inside. All of their attacks expose
the target to the Touch of Kyuss on a hit, making them the most contagious spawn
of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic melee attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Rotting Caress&lt;/strong&gt; that deals necrotic
damage. They can attack at range by making &lt;strong&gt;Writhing Pronouncements&lt;/strong&gt; that deal
immediate and ongoing 5 necrotic damage. This worsens to 10 and a daze on the
first failed save, and to 15 and a stun on the second (save ends). People killed
by this turn into wretches of Kyuss, which must be destroyed before the victims
can be raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter they can call an &lt;strong&gt;Eruption of Maggots&lt;/strong&gt; that acts as a
disgusting fireball-sized area attack. It deals immediate and ongoing necrotic
damage, and also creates a damaging zone that lasts for the rest of the
encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ewwww. Kill these with fire as soon as possible. If your GM is re-enacting the
Age of Worms campaign, you can expect to run into these things very often. Their
main gimmick is all about infecting people with the Touch of Kyuss, so PCs can
expect to stop and cast Remove Affliction more or less after every fight unless
they’re under extreme time pressure. Stage 1 is already a major debuff, and
staying at Stage 2 is a serious gamble.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Slaad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaads have appeared in every 4e Monster Manual so far. This one gives us more
exotic varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic slaad lore remains the same: technically sapient frog-like monsters from
the Elemental Chaos with lolrandom minds and a propensity to implant eggs into
other creatures. You can see the lore specific to each new variety in their
descriptions below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, chaos phage is a level 16 disease that represents being implanted
with a slaad egg. Stage 1 has no effect beyond this, stage 2 gives you a Will
penalty and makes you attack randomly while bloodied, stage 3 means the embryo
bursts out of your skull and kills you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other diseases it’s not hard to remove with the right ritual, but the
symptoms are severe enough that you’ll want to do it sooner rather than
later. And as usual the ritual takes time and costs a bunch of healing surges,
so it’s something that might add time pressure to a slaad focused adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;golden-slaad&quot;&gt;Golden Slaad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-slaad-golden.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaads are mostly immune to the chaos storms that often rage through portions of
the Elemental Chaos, which is why they like to follow these storms around. When
one of these storms manages to affect a slaad, it can mutate it into a golden
slaad. Golden Slaads are revered by their chromatic brethren, who follow them
around as if they were a chaos storm themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golden slaads are even more chaos-infused than their relatives, and can inject
that raw chaos in any victims they bite. Their gold-colored forms are unstable,
and if they’re wounded they became unable to sustain those forms, becoming
quivering (but still dangerous!) piles of ooze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures are Huge Elemental Humanoids and Level 20 Controllers with 193
HP. They have a ground speed of 8 and a teleport speed of 6, as well as
low-light vision and an immunity to chaos phage (like all slaads).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; is reach 3 and deals physical damage, with a random rider
depending on the result of the attack roll. If the roll is odd, it slides the
target 3 squares. If it’s even, it dazes them for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also emit &lt;strong&gt;Chaos Croaks&lt;/strong&gt; in a Close Burst 5 (recharge 5+). This
targets Will, does psychic damage, and has a random rider rolled on a d6 table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target is teleported 1d6 squares in a random direction (rolled on a d8).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target makes a melee basic attack against a random creature adjacent to it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target is stunned for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target is slowed (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target takes an extra 10 damage of a random elemental type rolled on a d10.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target is exposed to chaos phage, and if it was dazed by the slad it becomes
stunned instead (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the slaad is first bloodied it suffers an &lt;strong&gt;Amniotic Transformation&lt;/strong&gt; and
becomes an ooze. It becomes unable to teleport and its speed drops to 4, but it
gains a &lt;strong&gt;Corrosive Pseudopodia&lt;/strong&gt; attack that can be used as an opportunity
action against any adjacent enemy who moves or makes an attack. It deals minor
acid damage and grabs the target on a hit. With a minor action, the slaad can
sustian all of its grabs, deal acid damage to the victims, and regain 5 HP per
grabbed victim. So the loss of speed isn’t that crippling, because the slaad now
&lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; people to get adjacent to it. And it still retains the use of its other
attacks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putrid-slaad&quot;&gt;Putrid Slaad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an undead slaad. While it’s most often created on purpose by powerful
necromancers, it can also arise naturally when a slaad dies in the Abyss. These
“natural” putrid slaads have a tendency to obey demon lords, so you bet Orcus
loves them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The putrid slaad loses its ability to spread chaos phage, but it still fights
very similarly to a living one. It will even eat its victims. The remains rot
inside its non-functional guts, and then the monster vomits them when it attacks
its &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putrid Slaads are Large Elemental Animates (Undead), and Level 19 Brutes with
227 HP. Its basic &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack pulls the target 1 square, and &lt;strong&gt;Graping
Claws&lt;/strong&gt; allows it to make 2 of those with a single action. If both attacks hit,
the slaad grabs the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the putrid slaad has grabbed someone, it will hit them with its &lt;strong&gt;Horrific
Spew&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 6), which deals both immediate and ongoing acid and necrotic
damage (save ends). The spew can also be used as a Close Blast 3 attack, but it
has a +2 to-hit bonus when focused on the grabbed victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slaad can also &lt;strong&gt;cast aside&lt;/strong&gt; its grabbed victim, pushing them 5 squares,
dealing some automatic physical damage to the victim, and using it to make an
area attack against anyone adjacent to the victim when it lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-impressions&quot;&gt;Personal Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More slaads. As far as late-edition slaads go, these are pretty cool
mechanically. Golden Slaads finally deliver the promised dose of pure chaos
people expect when they first read the slaad’s basic lore, and putrid slaads
have this cool cycle of grabbing people and tossing them aside, with an
occasional dose of disgusting barf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skulks first appeared on the AD&amp;amp;D Fiend Folio. This is their 4e debut, with
all-new lore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centuries ago, the human empire of Bael Turath fought a dreadful war against the
dragonborn empire of Arkhosia. Bael Turath was never a nice place: its society
was severely stratified, and its ruling nobles were slavers that spared little
thought to those they enslaved. When it found itself losing the war against
Arkhosia, those same ruling nobles did not hesitate to turn to Hell for help,
and forged the diabolic pact that would see them and their descendants
transformed into tieflings. We’ve seen all of this before, and we also know that
the pact didn’t help them in the end. Bael Turath fell just the same, with the
pact’s boon at most allowing them to take Arkhosia with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this entry we see one of the reasons why it fell. The pact for infernal power
excluded Bael Turath’s large enslaved population, even as it lowered the
slavers’ guard. There was a huge rebellion where many of Bael Turath’s noble
caste were murdered in their sleep. Some of the rebels did this to escape their
bonds, but some did it because they were angry at being excluded from the
infernal pact. The Demon Prince Graz’zt was impressed with the latter and
reached out to them to offer his patronage. Those who accepted became the
creatures known as skulks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skulks are sapient humanoids with a supernatural affinity for
stealth. Ironically enough, they are much more indebted to their demon patron
than modern-day tieflings are to whatever devil mutated their ancestors. This
eternal debt is encoded in a document known as the &lt;em&gt;Book of the Blinded Eye&lt;/em&gt;,
and it bids even present-day skulks to follow the orders of Graz’zt’s
servants. They’re often sent out as assassins to eliminate threats to the cult
or their demon master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skulks’ hatred of tieflings is equally eternal, and probably also enforced
by the demonic pact. Skulks live as if Bael Turath never fell, and as if they’re
still infiltrated behind enemy lines. Left to their own devices, they will
pursue their original mission of murdering all tieflings. They spread along with
the tiefling diaspora as the latter fled their fallen empire. Any present-day
settlement that contains a sizable tiefling population is also likely to contain
a skulk population preying on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book paints all skulks with this demonic brush, but it would be simple to
say only a small percentage of them are this horrible, just like only a small
percentage of tieflings are diabolists. As with most other humanoid entries, you
can treat this one describing the form skulk &lt;em&gt;villains&lt;/em&gt; usually take, and not as
a species-wide portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine non-evil skulks would simply be reclusive and wish to be left alone,
either living in their own isolated communities or still “infiltrating” those of
others but without trying to murder anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skulks are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 6 and Low-Light
Vision. Their signature trait is Stealthy Step, which exempts them from the
Stealth penalty for moving more than 2 squares per turn or for running. All of
the individual entries have additional stealth powers beyond that, appropriate
to their role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entries here are appropriate threats for an early-to-mid-Heroic party. More
powerful skulks up to epic tier certainly exist, but are left as an exercise to
the GM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skulk-mesmerist&quot;&gt;Skulk Mesmerist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spellcaster specializing in charm and illusion magic. It’s a Level 3
Controller with 45 HP. Mesmerists fight with a &lt;strong&gt;short sword&lt;/strong&gt; and have a couple
of active attack powers. The first is &lt;strong&gt;Luring Charm&lt;/strong&gt;, a non-damaging ranged
attack that targets Will, slides the target 4 squares, and dazes then for a
turn. The other is &lt;strong&gt;Mesmerize&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) a ranged attack that targets
Will, deals psychic damage, and makes the target unable to see any enemies other
than the mesmerist themselves (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, they can also use &lt;strong&gt;Deceptive Veil&lt;/strong&gt; to look like any Medium
or Small humanoid. Piercing the illusion requires a DC 26 Insight check, which
is very hard even for a dedicated PC at this level. This is actually more
powerful than the Changeling’s disguise ability, since it also allows the
mesmerist to look like a Small humanoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skulk Mesmerists like to kill two birds with one stone by murdering a target
while looking like someone they want to frame for that murder. Their Veil also
makes it possible for the GM to make an adventure where an innocent changeling
is charged for a string of murders perpetrated by a skulk mesmerist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skulk-murderer&quot;&gt;Skulk Murderer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one does what it says on the tin. Over and over and over. It’s a Level 3
Lurker with 37 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the standard Stealthy Step trait, the murderer also has &lt;strong&gt;Peerless
Camouflage&lt;/strong&gt; that allows it to hide while it only has partial cover or
concealment, and to remain hidden if it still has cover or concealment at the
end of a movement. It also has &lt;strong&gt;Unseen Strike&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets it deal extra
damage against targets that couldn’t see at the start of its turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The murderer fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Short sword&lt;/strong&gt; and can thrown a &lt;strong&gt;Shuriken Volley&lt;/strong&gt;
once per encounter. This lets it make three ranged attacks, which deal a bit of
damage and immobilize (save ends) on a hit. All of these can benefit from Unseen
Strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When playing one of these, you want to start the fight hidden and open it with a
Shuriken Volley. Then you alternate between re-establishing stealth and striking
with the sword. A mesmerist in the same team as the murder makes it a lot more
dangerous, because now the murderer doesn’t need to waste time hiding to benefit
from Unseen Strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skulk-hunter&quot;&gt;Skulk Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another stealthy killer, but this one is a Level 5 Soldier with 61 HP. It fights
with a longsword, and even its basic attack is funny: it’s called &lt;strong&gt;Baffling
Blade&lt;/strong&gt;, and it if hits it allows the hunter to stay hidden from the target. Its
special attack is the &lt;strong&gt;Invisible Blade&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), which targets someone
who can’t see the hunter, deals double damage, and inflicts ongoing 5 damage
(save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both attacks mark the target as an effect, and if an enemy marked by the hunter
shifts the hunter gets to use Baffling Blade against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunters also go very well with mesmerists: the mesmerist can make them invisible
to a PC while they set up as the traditional front line preventing the PC from
reaching the mesmerist. They can use Invisible Blade against the afflicted
victim without having to hide, and they can also hide without having to leave
formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the lore entry, I like this entry much better if I read it as
describing the typical skulk &lt;em&gt;villain&lt;/em&gt; instead of describing the typical
&lt;em&gt;skulk&lt;/em&gt;. Mechanically, I like how the three stat blocks synergize - they’re
clearly meant to be used together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied monsters might include Graz’zt cultists and minor demons. Anything that
can make their monster buddies invisible also works really well with skulks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Shardmind</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-shardmind.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shardminds made their debut as a playable option in the Player’s Handbook 3 for
4e. They’re new to this edition and really lean into its background lore for
psionics. They also have the honor of being the second living construct species
presented in the game (after Warforged). This entry presents some shardmind stat
blocks for use as NPCs or enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the dawn of time there was a crystaline entity named the Living Gate. Neither
god nor primordial, the Gate protected the border between the known planes and
the Far Realm. It stood firm even during the Dawn War, but it was eventually
sundered by the combined efforts of mind flayers, beholders and other Far Realm
inhabitants who wanted to enter the world for reasons ranging from the
inscrutable to the foul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Living Gate was shattered and its pieces spread through the cosmos,
its will lived on, gifting the disparate shards with life and purpose. These are
the shardminds, living constructs with a strong affinity for psionic power and
ancestral memories that compel them to rebuild the Living Gate and once again
seal the Far Realm away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that common ancestral memory shardminds as individuals are as varied in
outlook and personality as any other sapient species. Over the ages they have
formed three major schools of thought that propose different ways of continuing
the mission of the Living Gate. The MM3 doesn’t describe all of them, but I will
because they’re cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Thought Builders&lt;/strong&gt; believe the correct solution is to build a new Living
Gate and imbue it with the psionic power necessary to seal the Far Realm. Their
main goal is to acquire the knowledge necessary to do so. They tend to be Good
and worship Ioun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The God Shards&lt;/strong&gt; believe that the Shardminds now form a distributed network
that carries on the duties of the Living Gate. It’s each individual’s duty to
train and nurture their own power so that they can better contribute to this
task. Once this network is strong enough, the Far Realm will be sealed. They
tend to be Unaligned and worship no gods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Shard Slayers&lt;/strong&gt; are the faction most likely to come into conflict with the
PCs. They believe that the original Living Gate can rebuild itself if it’s
psionic energy is allowed to return to its original site. However, this energy
is “trapped” in the shardminds, and must be forcibly “released”. So yeah,
adherents of this philosophy want to kill all other shardminds and then
themselves. They are usually Evil and worship Vecna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stat blocks in this entry represent Shard Slayers suitable as mid-to-late
Heroic opposition. If your group has one or more shardminds, they have a
built-in reason to be hostile. Even if it doesn’t, most non-Evil PCs will be
interested in stopping a bunch of genocidal maniacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shardminds are Immortal Humanoids with the Living Construct keyword. They have
Resist 5 Psychic and a ground speed of 6. Their signature power is the same one
PCs get: &lt;strong&gt;Shardswarm&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter power which allows them to break apart and
reform a short distance away. This causes every adjacent enemy to grant combat
advantage for a turn and lets the shardmind teleport half their speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shardminds speak Common, Deep Speech, and have telepathy with range 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shardmind-warseeker&quot;&gt;Shardmind Warseeker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This psychic warrior disguises its true nature beneath a suit of plate, and
wanders about seeking shardminds to slay. Its outwardly calm demeanor hides a
murderous rage, which reveals itself when it’s wounded in combat or when an
innocent bystander fails to answer its questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warseeker is a Level 6 Soldier with 70 HP. It wears plate and fights with a
broadsword and a heavy crossbow. Heavy armor means its speed is only 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;crossbow&lt;/strong&gt; are basic attacks that damage and mark
for a turn. If a marked enemy within 5 squares of the warseeker targets makes an
attack that doesn’t target it, the warseeker can deal 5 psychic damage to that
enemy. Once the warseeker is bloodied, its &lt;strong&gt;Furious Mind&lt;/strong&gt; grants it 10
temporary HP, a -2 penalty to AC, and a +4 bonus to damage for the rest of the
fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a basic frontline fighter with some tricks borrowed from the paladin and
the barbarian. It’s sticky and a good choice to form a solid “wall” with other
soldiers and brutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shardmind-dominator&quot;&gt;Shardmind Dominator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A psion who is a big fan of mind control. It’s a Level 8 Controller with 86
HP. It wields a &lt;strong&gt;dagger&lt;/strong&gt; as a basic melee attack, but the important bits are
its powers geared towards brute-force mind control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overwhelming Mind&lt;/strong&gt; is an at-will power that only has an “Effect” line,
meaning this always happens: it forces an enemy within 5 squares to make a melee
or ranged basic attack against a target of the dominator’s choice. If the attack
hits, the dominator slides the enemy 3 squares. &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Puppet&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+)
is a non-damaging ranged attck that dominates the target on a hit (save
ends). And &lt;strong&gt;Mind Swarm&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) is an area attack that deals psychic
damage and creates a zone that lasts the rest of the encounter. Enemies who end
their turn inside can be slid 3 squares by the dominator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dominators will be doing little damage on their own, but they’ll cause lots of
friendly fire incidents and will make it very hard for the party to maintain any
sort of coherent formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shardmind-executioner&quot;&gt;Shardmind Executioner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A skilled assassin dispatched to murder shardminds identified by its
buddies. It’s a Level 10 Lurker with 81 HP, wielding a crystal greatsword called
a &lt;strong&gt;Shardblade&lt;/strong&gt;. It does standard damage for its level, which can be increased
by the &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Boost&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+). This is a free-action power that
triggers when the executioner hits with the sword, so it’s never wasted on a
missed attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executioner attacks a range with a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; power, which deals light
psychic damage and blinds the target for a turn. It can also perform a &lt;strong&gt;Psychic
Infiltration&lt;/strong&gt;, a melee attack vs. Will. On a hit this removes the executioner
from play and causes the target to suffer 20 ongoing psychic damage and be dazed
(save ends). When the target saves, the executioner appears adjacent to it. This
is an at-will power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A boosted sword strike actually deals more damage than a round of Infiltration,
but the latter is an excellent move to use while Psychic Boost recharges, as it
shields the shardmind from damage. So this lurker actually hides inside the
enemy’s minds, and deals massive damage while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love all the living constructs, and shardminds are no exception. Their default
appearance is a bit meh, but as you can see by the illustrations I chose here
this can be easily remedied.&lt;/p&gt;
