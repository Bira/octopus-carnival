        <title>Let's Read Hells Rebels 3, Part 2</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series! Go to the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/&quot;&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt; to see all entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s continue our reading of Dance of the Damned! I expect this to be the
second of three posts for this adventure. In the last one, we covered two
chapters of the book. Let’s aim for two more here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-3-the-vyre-accord&quot;&gt;Chapter 3: The Vyre Accord&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vyre is a city located in the same province as Kintargo. There’s a whole
mini-guide on it attached to the book, but the only thing we really need to know
is that it’s pretty much Fucked-Up Fantasy Venice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though technically part of Cheliax, Vyre is almost entirely independent. Cheliax
tolerates this because the city is a prime vacation destination for Chelish
elites. On the other hand, Vyre’s slice of coast makes for a shitty port, so
they’re almost entirely reliant on nearby Kintargo for the sea trade that gets
them most of their food and luxuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vyre’s government is extremely self-interested, but Cheliax has good reasons to
maintain good relations with them, and they have good reasons to maintain good
relations with Kintargo. If Vyre backs the rebellion, they can exert pressure on
those Chelish elites to back off from the province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allies-and-information&quot;&gt;Allies and Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advance information on the city comes from two sources. Captain Sargaeta, whom
the PCs befriended in Adventure 02, can tell them the basics, and give them a
ride there on his ship. Molly Mayapple can provide them with extensive and
invaluable advice on their actual goal in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCs haven’t met Molly yet, but they should have recovered a bunch of
documents belonging to her from the Lucky Bones. These are deeds for a set of
waterfront warehouses, which were stolen by the extinct Gray Spiders decades
ago. Even though Molly has since rebuilt her fortune (she owns a successful
hotel), she’s still going to be extremely grateful when the PCs hand the deeds
back to her, and will provide a lot of insider information and help. They can
track her down from the information on the deeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-basics&quot;&gt;The Basics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vyre is ruled by five monarchs, each tasked with an aspect of government. The
one they want to meet is Manticce Kaleeki, the Queen of Delights, who is in
charge of the city’s economy and foreign relations. Vyre’s laws are simple yet
baroque, creating an environment where non-lethal duels and eternal feuds are
common, all sales are final, but prejudice of any sort is frowned upon. However,
you can get away with anything if you follow the last and most important rule:
don’t get caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Queen of Delights is set to host a banquet in the near future, and that will
be the PCs’ opportunity to talk to her. The GM determines how long the PCs have
until the banquet. Most of this time is probably going to be spent looking for
outfits, gifts, and information, but the GM can also introduce a few Vyre
sidequests to spice things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-banquet&quot;&gt;The Banquet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Banquet might be an entirely non-violent scene, but it’s as difficult to
navigate as any dungeon. Vyre high-society etiquette is weird, and the Queen of
Delights heaps even more weird on top of that because she’s basically Morticia
Addams as a Tiefling in Fucked-Up Fantasy Venice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molly’s help is absolutely vital here. The book doesn’t even mention how the PCs
get invited to the banquet, but I assume she’s instrumental in arranging
invitations for them and for herself. She’s also an excellent source of
information on the complex etiquette surrounding the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This starts with what to wear and what gifts to bring. Molly knows what the
Queen likes, and PCs good at gathering information might learn about Manticce’s
less well-known preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are nine other guests in the banquet aside from Molly and the PCs. We get
personality notes for each one. Most are only sources of roleplaying color, but
one of them will be important in the next adventure: Hei-fen, former
guildmistress of the Gray Spiders. Tough it’s been decades since she escaped the
destruction of that guild, she’s still a spiteful old wererat and is angry at
the PCs for stealing “her home”. She’s here to size them up for future reprisal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other “special” guest, not counted among those nine, is the Queen’s long
dead husband, whose skeleton adorns one of the table’s chairs. The correct move
here is to not acknowledge poor Gomez in any way. To do so is considered crass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While roleplaying should be first and foremost in this scene it also has a
mechanical component. The banquet is effectivelly a long and colorful skill
challenge. PCs get a number of starting “banquet points” depending on how they
dress, what gifts they bring, and whether or not they participate in a standing
ovation when the Queen appears (they should!). After that, each course in the
banquet allows them several opportunities to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is a knowledge skill test to identify the dish in question and how to
eat it (probably &lt;strong&gt;Area Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Current Affairs&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Savoir-Faire&lt;/strong&gt; in
GURPS). Careful PCs can just wait for one of the other guests to start eating
and skip the skill test, but succeeding shows they know what they’re doing and
earns them a point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is a series of tests to actually eat the course, which varies with
each dish. There’s no way to skip this one, though the PCs doesn’t need to
succeed at them all to earn a point. If they do, they earn extra. If they fail
badly enough or just decide to forgo rolling and eat the thing wrong on purpose,
they lose points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is a social skill test to do well in the conversation that accompanies
that dish. This would likely be &lt;strong&gt;Fast-Talk&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/strong&gt; or even &lt;strong&gt;Public
Speaking&lt;/strong&gt; in GURPS, modified by what the players actually say. Success makes
them come off as smooth operators and earns points. Failure loses points and
leaves them embarrassed. Again careful characters can just keep quiet and skip
this part, but it earns them nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dishes range from the merely bizarre to the horrific:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We start with &lt;strong&gt;quicksoup&lt;/strong&gt;, a bowl of boiling hot soup accompanied by a water
bowl containing five small live fish and a set of peculiar utensils. This
requires tests involving manual dexterity to properly poach the fish in the
soup and eat them. Probably plain &lt;strong&gt;DX&lt;/strong&gt; modified by &lt;strong&gt;Manual Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; in
GURPS, though I’d also let a daring PC test &lt;strong&gt;Surgery&lt;/strong&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next is &lt;strong&gt;Galtan Squash&lt;/strong&gt;, which looks like a severed head but is just a
carved pumpkin full of extremely spicy red soup. This is a straight-up
Fortitude save/&lt;strong&gt;HT&lt;/strong&gt; roll to endure the spice. A bad enough failure leaves
your face swollen and penalizes your talky rolls for the rest of the feast!
I’d probably let it be modified by &lt;strong&gt;Resistant to Poison&lt;/strong&gt; and other
advantages that include it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you get the &lt;strong&gt;Unseen Feast&lt;/strong&gt;, meat pies made from the flesh of an
invisible stalker. I’m pretty sure invisible stalkers are sapient, which makes
this the most horrific dish of the lot. It’s quite possible some PCs will
refuse to eat this one on moral grounds. Those who decide to forge ahead need
to be fast and perceptive. They have to eat the invisible meat before it turns
visible and loses its flavor. PCs who can see invisibility can pass this one
automatically, though it’s considered crass to cast a spell for it while on
the table. Others must succeed at a difficult &lt;strong&gt;Perception&lt;/strong&gt; check, which I
guess I would modify for &lt;strong&gt;Acute Smell/Taste&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, you get &lt;strong&gt;Sweefats With Honey Sauce&lt;/strong&gt; for dessert. Sweetfats are
candied spiders - this is an Underdark dish. The most difficult thing here is
opening the honey sauce container, which is a mundane replica of a
Hellraiser-style puzzle box. Time to break out the &lt;strong&gt;Thaumathology&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Lore (Demons)&lt;/strong&gt; skills, though I guess &lt;strong&gt;Traps&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/strong&gt;
might also work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether Vyre allies with the Silver Ravens or not depends entirely on how many
banquet points the characters manage to get. They need at least 20. A party of 5
who arrives properly dressed will start out with 10, and might get a few more
from bringing optimal gifts. Even so, they will still need to take active part
in at least some of the banquet in order to succeed at the mission. I’d probably
give them a sign that they succeeded once they get enough points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the party succeeds, the Queen might invite the individual who gained them the
most points for an intimate night. Ties go to the prettiest or most charismatic
PC, and if they’re still tied she invites all of the tied PCs. If the party has
more than 30 points &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the propositioned PC(s) accept Manticce’s invitation,
she will also offer the group her personal alliance, providing extra mechanical
boosts to the strategic rebellion layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Notes and Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part is very different than what you would expect from a standard dungeon
fantasy adventure. It can be really fun for PCs who like role-playing, so even
in a condensed approach I’d recommend keeping it. If you want to make the Unseen
Feast part less objectionable, you could perhaps say the “meat” is gelatinous
cube jelly, which is almost as hard to see and doesn’t come from something
sapient. And if you don’t want to feature sexual themes at all in the adventure,
you could remove Manticce’s invitation at the end and just say that the party
gets her personal support if they get more than 30 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside when using GURPS is that if your PCs are overly focused on dungeon
delving they might not have the skills necessary to cause a good impression
here. In this case I suggest being generous: if none of the delvers has the most
appropriate skill, ask for a roll on the closest skill one of them does have, or
perhaps even roll against DX or IQ. That said, characters who followed the tips
from the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2017/05/01/hells-rebels-player-guide.html&quot;&gt;Player’s Guide&lt;/a&gt; or who used earned points to become a bit sneakier
and more social shouldn’t have too much trouble covering their bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-4-breaking-the-menador-gap&quot;&gt;Part 4: Breaking the Menador Gap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Menador Gap is a mountain pass in the mountains separating Ravounel from
central Cheliax. It’s the only viable route for marching an army through those
mountains, so it must be closed. The PCs start the adventure at level 7, and the
book says they should be level 8 before tackling this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap is protected by a fortress named Menador Keep. It used to be an old
dwarf fort, but is now occupied by Chelish military. Rexus, who studied those
old Silver Raven documents extensively, can tell the PCs that there’s a dwarven
self-destruct mechanism deep within the bowels of the fort. The PCs’ goal here
is to get to that mechanism, activate it, and get out. This will demolish the
fort in a way that ensures the pass is completely closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s theoretically possible to demolish the fort from a distance using spells
like Earthquake, but a) this might not block the pass completely and b) it will
bury all the sweet loot located inside the fortress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dungeon-menador-gap&quot;&gt;Dungeon: Menador Gap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fortress itself has two above-ground floors and an underground level. Its
ground floor contains a courtyard with two large gates on either side, which
blocks the mountain pass. Inside the building are a large number of guard posts,
utility/storage rooms, and a couple of monster pens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fort is defended by a garrison of 23 soldiers, commanded by Lucien Thrune, a
wyvern-riding cavalier. He also has a bound erinyes devil with him, and a very
unhappy bound jann servant. Another devil acts as a stationary sentry at the
entrance to the treasury. The soldiers are weak individually, but dangerous in
large groups. They wear mail and are armed with halberds and crossbows, favoring
ranged attacks over melee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to handle this might be as a Metal Gear-like stealth mission. The
PCs are very likely to have the necessary magic to turn the whole party
invisible and levitate them for a short time. Clever PCs might find the entrnce
to the wyvern’s stable down on the cliffside and enter through there, bypassing
a lot of the security measures on the surface. The same technique might allow
them to land atop the fort’s battlements and begin from there, bypassing the
courtyard kill box. Even if they immediately go loud and begin a frontal
assault, they’ll begin doing that from a hugely advantageous position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third-best option is for them to disguise themselves as someone authorized
to cross the Gap and ride into the courtyard, from which they can force their
way into the fort. It’s less than ideal because they can be targetted by
crossbow and ballista fire from the battlements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting an overt assault will sound a general alert and have every soldier
converge on the party’s position. It’s easier to deal with them piecemeal,
though that might require magic to prevent the sounds of fighting from spilling
out. Stealth might also allow the party to fight the “elites” (Lucien, his
wyvern, the devils) while they’re alone and isolated. The jann servant, Zorumar,
is a potential ally here. He can’t do anything against his master directly, but
he can give all sorts of information about enemy locations and the layout of the
fort, including all secret doors. Killing Lucien will set Zorumar free, and he
will return in the future to gift the party with magic items in thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a secret door in the fort’s armory leading to the ancient dwarven
mechanism in the “basement” level. The only one of its current inhabitants who
knows about this is Zorumar.  The device, called the Anvil of Unmaking, is
protected by ancient guardians and traps, some of which can be bypassed by
proper prayers to the dwarf god Torag and by diplomacy. Activating the
contraption will cause it to completely destroy the fortress in 10 minutes. The
PCs have that long to run away and get clear. Also the tremors and rumbling will
definitely put every remaining enemy in the place on high alert, if they weren’t
already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loot-wise, the most valuable places to hit here are the treasury (obviously),
the war room, and Lucien Thrune’s person. Lucien has a sweet flaming sword, lots
of bling, and the key to the treasury chest. The treasury has a bunch of magical
gear and the fort’s payroll. And the war room has an extremely valuable dagger
lying around next to a pile of important strategic documents full of classified
Chelish military info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes-and-impressions-1&quot;&gt;Notes and Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good old tactical espionage action romp, with the potential to turn into a
wonderfully chaotic battle if the PCs trip the alarm. It’s likely to be the most
time-consuming scene in the entire adventure, and could conceivably take more
than one session to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest playing the enemies with a modicum of intelligence here, but remember
that raising the alarm is not an automatic action. If a single guard spots the
PCs, the rest of the fortress won’t automatically know they’re there. An alarm
must be raised, which takes time and is susceptible to disruption from the PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Oghma Domain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Oghma is the Forgotten Realms god of knowledge, occupying the same conceptual
slot as Ioun does on the default 4e setting. His purview includes knowledge,
inspiration, and discovery. His followers believe that to serve him is to serve
the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stats for this domain can also be used for priests of the god Gond, which I
think is an artificer god?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics&quot;&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oghma’s powers focus on boosting allies’ skill checks by granting them bonuses
or rerolls, and on penalizing enemy attacks and saves. Its main distinction from
other domains is that its attack powers focus on doing &lt;em&gt;psychic&lt;/em&gt; damage instead
of Radiant, though one of your at-wills still does radiant and thunder damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old character optimization forums rate this domain as pretty good, though
they say it takes until the mid-Paragon tier to really get going: its level 11
feature makes that radiant and thunder at-will immobilize on a hit, and its
level 16 one makes your Healing Word grant the target a free basic attack. You
should still be able to do just fine in a standard Heroic-only Neverwinter
campaign, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, this theme combos well with the Oghma’s Faithful. The
domain’s first-level feature lets you use Wisdom to make Int-based skill checks,
and the skill-boosting abilities from the theme will let you easily become the
party’s encyclopedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have much to say about this domain that hasn’t been said above
already. Oghma isn’t a particularly exciting FR deity to me, though this
campaign does give his clerics some pretty nice hooks. The domain’s powers could
easily be used for priests of Ioun in a campaign in the core setting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Corellon Domain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the default 4e setting, Corellon is the universal god of spring, beauty and
the arts, and also the patron of arcane magic. In Forgotten Realms, his original
setting, he is the head of the elven pantheon. His portfolion includes all of
the above plus nature, war, and most other things elves care about. All of his
worshippers are elves or eladrin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warpriests of Corellon are known as Fey Wardens, and take it as their holy
mission to both protect elves and their culture, and also promote and spread the
greatness of that culture. I don’t think he wants non-elves to worship him, he
just wants non-elves to know elves are better than them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stats for this domain can also be used for priests of other elven gods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics&quot;&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most other Warpriest domains are melee-only, but Corellon’s weapon powers can be
used with either melee or ranged weapons. This means the theme is designed to
take advantage of the racial weapon proficiencies elves and eladrin get, and is
particularly suited to moon or sun elves who replace Eladrin Education with Elf
Weapon Proficiency. They get proficiency with both the long sword and the long
bow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its ranged attack emphasis, the domain’s powers also focus on
granting extra mobility to the cleric’s allies, with a secondary focus on making
enemies easier to hit by either nullifying cover or granting allies combat
advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old character optimization forums say this is the domain that relies on
Constitution the least, so players are free to put those points on Dexterity
instead, particularly if they plan on favoring ranged combat or wearing light
armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to cover all of the powers in detail here, but I think the
domain’s two at-wills are fun. Both are melee or ranged weapon attacks using
Wisdom vs. AC and dealing 1W + Wis mod damage. &lt;strong&gt;Blessing of the Wild&lt;/strong&gt; lets the
cleric or an ally within 5 squares shift 1 square as a free action, and
&lt;strong&gt;Graceful Switch&lt;/strong&gt; lets them stow a weapon and draw another as a free action
before making the attack. The latter also deals force and radiant damage, so the
cleric is never without something that can put the hurt on incorporeal undead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the mechanical aspect of this domain, though I’m not a big fan of
the “elves are better than everyone else” mentality in its lore. It’s quite easy
to remove, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This domain’s powers would be very well suited to a core deity like Avandra,
with their flexibility and focus on mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Warpriest Domains Introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before we launch into talking about domains, let’s talk about
warpriests. “Warpriest” is the official name for the Essentials version of the
Cleric class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classic PHB Clerics (also known as “Templars” post-Essentials) had a set of
Strength-based melee weapon powers and another of Wisdom-based ranged implement
powers. They were generally discouraged from mixing-and-matching, and over time
the community decided that the Wisdom-based “laser cleric” build was the better
of the two, particularly when you only had the core. There were certain levels
that had no Strength powers in them, a situation that would only be remedied in
supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warpriests are another attempt at a melee cleric - all of their attack abilities
are are Wisdom-based &lt;em&gt;weapon&lt;/em&gt; powers. Warpriest Domains are the solution found
by Essential’s designers to reduce the number of decisions a player must make in
order to play a cleric. Your pick one at character creation, and that determines
not only all of your level 1 powers but also most of the encounter powers and
features you get at higher levels all the way to the end of epic tier. They’re
practically ready-made builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, some of these belong to your paragon path, but Warpriests are in
effect limited to a single choice there, which continues to provide powers from
your chosen domain. Someone who is really into character optimization might pick
a path from another source, but you can just stick to the default Devout
Warpriest path and still be pretty effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroes of the Fallen Lands, the book that introduced Warpriests, also
introduced the Sun and Storm domains. Heroes of Shadow added the Death
domain for spooky clerics, and Dragon 392 included the Earth domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Neverwinter campaign setting gives us four more domains, doubling the amount
available in the game at the time of its publication. These are all dedicated to
specific FR gods, but they can be used for similar deities from this or other
settings. Though the Neverwinter campaign focuses on the heroic tier, the
domains presented here include powers for the full 30 levels of a character’s
career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to talk about each domain in very general terms, as it would take an
age to go through every power in detail. We’ll cover one domain per post, and
they should each be fairly short.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Elf and Eladrin Racial Variants</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I introduced eladrin in my readings of the Monster Manual, I wrote that I
loved that 4e decided to make a more obvious split between the “fey magician”
and “woodsy archer” archetypes for elves, because previous attempts were usually
a bit muddled and tended to vary too much between settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Forgotten Realms was one of these previous attempts, since it had sun,
moon, wood, and wild elves. From reading this book, I know now that these elf
types form a spectrum from “more fey” to “more woodsy”, but I didn’t know this
before looking it up. Other settings like Greyhawk and Dragonlance have their
own proprietary classifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of elves in FR as told by this book is similar to the generic version:
they arrived from the Feywild at the dawn of time as a single people and split
into three separate ones over the following centuries: sun elves, moon elves,
and those who would become the drow. After the war that originated the drow,
some of the survivors decided to go back to nature and became wood and wild
elves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes here, Sun and Moon Elves are eladrin racial variants, while
Wood and Wild Elves are elf racial variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moon-elves&quot;&gt;Moon Elves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moon Elves are the friendlier sort of eladrin. Their cultural wanderlust means
they roamed further than their cousins and took longer to build stationary
empires, but also established good relations with most of the other peoples of
the world. While some of them became more isolationist after the Spellplague,
you can still find moon elves living in many “mortal” kingdoms and
communities. They consider themselves citizens of their nation first, and moon
elves second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Feywild in conjunction with the world, many moon elves have also moved
over there to explore the plane anew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical moon elf PCs are curious, open-minded, and bold, believing that magic
can be found anywhere and good deeds should not be hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can choose to replace their skill bonuses to Arcana and History with
Insight and Streetwise, and to replace the Eladrin Education feature with
&lt;strong&gt;Elven Weapon Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (longbow and shortbow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For background picks, they can choose between the Diplomacy and Streetwise
skills, and the Chondathan, Damaran, and Untheric languages. All are different
human languages, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sun-elf&quot;&gt;Sun Elf&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun Elves are assholes. They consider themselves superior to everyone else, even
other elves. To many of them the Spellplague proved that even the non-elven gods
are inferior to the elven ones, since the latter emerged mostly unscathed and
the former very much didn’t. Some of them welcome their renewed connection to
the Feywild, while others view the “core eladrin” newcomers from that plane as
yet another inferior species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun elf characters are typically patient, aloof, and incredibly racist. I think
their lore in previous editions even has them engaging in genocidal plans? Even
if I’m misremembering that bit I would probably still not allow sun elf PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can choose to replace their Arcana/History skill bonuses with
Bluff/Insight, Eladrin Weapon Proficiency with the same Elf Weapon Proficiency
moon elves get, and Eladrin Education with &lt;strong&gt;Wizard Implement
Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt;. This lets them use wands, orbs and staffs with implement powers
from any class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their background picks are the Arcana, Bluff, History and Insight skills, or the
Draconic language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wild-elf&quot;&gt;Wild Elf&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wild Elves are also assholes. They are described as being as xenophobic as sun
elves, and even more isolationist. Their culture is all about living as close to
nature as possible and venerating the primal spirits, which they believe is how
the common ancestors to all elves lived in ancient times. According to them
everyone else is Doing it Wrong, even other elves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wild elf characters are typically respectful of nature and the spirits, nomadic
in honor of the wanderlust Corellon gave their people, and incredibly racist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can replace Elven Accuracy with &lt;strong&gt;Subtle Step&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them shift
their speed once per encounter as a move action. This is very useful considering
elves ignore forest-themed difficult terrain. They can also replace Group
Awareness with &lt;strong&gt;Wild Elf Weapon Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (javelin, spear, longspear).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their associated background skills are Nature, Perception, and Stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wood-elves&quot;&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood Elves are the most similar to core elves. They have friendly relations with
other peoples, and while they also live close to nature they are not nomadic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical wood elves are protective of their forest homes, but also careful and
compassionate. A wood elf might let a trespasser go by if that trespass is not
doing any actual harm, whereas a wild elf would kill them on principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can replace Elven Accuracy with &lt;strong&gt;Sense Threat&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them roll
Perception for initiative and give all allies with a lower initiative than them
a +2 bonus to their own rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let me stop for a moment here. This feels amazingly overpowered. The power
itself is described in “natural language” not much different from the
paraphrased paragraph above, so we don’t know if it’s a power or just a passive
ability. In this case, though, there is no difference - you only ever roll
Initiative once per fight, so an encounter power like this would get used every
fight anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elf rangers, rogues and fey warlocks simply must train Perception and get this
ability. With their ancestry bonuses to Wisdom and Perception, this ensures they
will almost always go first, and give +2 Initiative to the entire rest of the
party too. Clerics care a bit less about going first, but that Initiative bonus
to all allies would still make this power nearly mandatory from a mechanics
perspective. You’re more or less getting an entire warlord class feature for
free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, going back to their other ability: they can replace Group Awareness with
&lt;strong&gt;Reactive Stealth&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them roll Stealth to hide at the same time they
roll Initiative, if they have cover or concealment. Another “mandatory” pick for
stealthy strikers, and better than the equivalent utility power from the Bregan
Spy since you get it at level 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood elf background picks are the Diplomacy, Insight and Nature skills, and the
Chondathan, Damaran, Dwarven, Giant and Goblin languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone among this book’s authors &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; likes wood elves. They’re basically
100% core book elves in outlook and narrative role, but their alternate features
are by far the most powerful in this entry. Making Sense Threat into a Daily
power would bring it to within barely acceptable bounds, though it would still
be quite a bit stronger than the similar ability we saw for Oghma’s Faithful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wild and Sun Elves also have a couple of interesting abilities in Subtle Step
and Wizard Implement Proficiency respectively. The rest of these variant
abilities are more or less equivalent to what they replace. Moon elves are the
only variant here that could become proficient in both longbows and longswords
regardless of class, since they can have the two proficiency traits at the same
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lore-wise, I would again probably not allow players to play Sun or Wild elves as
written, because those two variants are racist assholes. I would still let them
take their replacement features if they so wanted, while being some other type
of elf or eladrin.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Dwarf Racial Variants</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Forgotten Realms has had a list of setting-specific elf and dwarf subraces since
its inception, one which differs from the setup in the 4e Player’s Handbook. The
FR Player’s Guide releases a few years before Neverwinter included a few notes
mapping them to the 4e setup, but those were mostly roleplaying-oriented. Here,
we go deeper and get variant rules for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each variant has a set of benefits that replace standard traits from the
PHB. Players can choose as many of these as they want, so it’s still possible to
choose zero and play a PHB-standard character. Variants also have associated
background skills, which work like those from the themes and might also include
languages. If you pick a language, you’re fluent in it both in speech and
writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you can still only have one background pick - if you choose a skill or
language from these variants, you can’t pick one from your theme or another
source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the rest of this post, we’ll be looking at the variants for dwarves. Next one
is elves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;forgotten-realms-dwarves&quot;&gt;Forgotten Realms Dwarves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DR dwarves were forged by Moradin at the dawn of time, deep underground. They
reached the surface in a moutainous region and built one of its first mortal
empires. Divisions among this empire caused part of the population to migrate
west into the Great Rift, a plains region filled with underground caves. This
was lucky because some ancient cataclysm then wiped out the original
Mountainhome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These plains dwarves split further over the course of history: some journeyed
further into the world, while some stayed on the Rift. Distance changed these
two groupings, though they remain on friendly terms and have a lot of culture in
common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gold-dwarves&quot;&gt;Gold Dwarves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold Dwarves are those who stayed on and under the Great Rift. They proudly
trace their ancestry back to the dawn of time, and as a result are a deeply
traditionalist people that places great value on codes of honor. They believe
each individual has their pre-determined place in society and frown upon those
who would reject their fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the spellplague, gold dwarves had started expanding and migrating out of
the Rift, and this is what saved them as a culture when the plague hit and
destroyed it. A lot of the survivors returned and are attempting to rebuild, and
the disaster also convinced some of them to seek new ways of doing things where
tradition fails them. Other clans have instead doubled down and become actively
xenophobic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical Gold Dwarf PC is expected to place great importance on tradition and
lineage, and to respect their elders. Getting to know someone also means
learning about their family tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can choose to replace Cast-Iron Stomach with &lt;strong&gt;Cast-Iron Mind&lt;/strong&gt;, gaining a
+5 to saves vs. ongoing psychic damage. They can also replace Dwarven Weapon
Proficiency with &lt;strong&gt;Gold Dwarf Weapon Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; to become proficient with the
war pick and the maul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their background skill is Dungeoneering, and their background languages are Deep
Speech and Elven. They deal with drow and other Underdark denizens a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shield-dwarves&quot;&gt;Shield Dwarves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shield Dwarves migrated out of the Great Rift early, spreading through the world
and encountering more foreign people over their history. As a result they’re
more open to seeking out friends and forging alliances. Though they also value
tradition and honor, they do not consider it dishonorable for an individual to
seek to forge their own destiny, even when it takes them away from home. Delzoun
was founded by Shield Dwarves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impermanence seems to be a big thing for your typical shield dwarf PC. They are
open to alliances and friendships because they know tradition can fail them, but
they are also reserved with those allies because they know allies can fail them
too. When facing problems, they’re all about striking first and taking control
of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shield Dwarves can replace their Dwarven Weapon Proficiency with either &lt;strong&gt;Shield
Dwarf Weapon Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (proficient in handaxes and battle axes) or &lt;strong&gt;Shield
Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (proficient with the light shield).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a background pick, they can choose between the Dungeoneering, Endurance and
Nature skills, or the Chondathan and Giant languages (FR has a lot more
languages than core 4e).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FR has been around since the early days of D&amp;amp;D, so I don’t know whether generic
D&amp;amp;D dwarves take they traditionalism from FR ones or if it’s the other way
around. Shield dwarves are the ones most similar to those in the core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Weapon Proficienty replacements seem to be about the same (low) power level,
but Shield Proficiency is more generally useful to any non-martial PC who
normally has a hand free. Wand and orb wizards, dagger sorcerers, many monks,
and so on. An extra point of AC and Reflex always helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cast-Iron Mind is an awesome replacement feature to take when you know you’ll be
facing a lot of psychic enemies, which includes most things with the Aberrant
origin. Spoiler alert: there’s quite a few of these in the Neverwinter campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Bregan D'Aerthe Spy</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-neverwinter-bregan-spy.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I learned about the Bregan D’Aerthe is that WotC’s authors
really like them. This is an organization of mercenary drow led by this dude
named Jarlaxe Baenre, a swashbuckler that’s basically a wittier and more morally
ambiguous Drizz’t. Its members are all some sort of outcast from drow society,
such as members of fallen houses and “houseless males” (in the words of the FR
setting book). They can show up anywhere in the world and are always on the
lookout for an opportunity to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They started out as a ready source of sudden ninja attacks, but by 5e they seem
to appear in every published campaign as one of the factions in play, and even
as a possible patron for PCs. No matter where the story takes place, there’s
always a smirking drow asshole hanging in the background, ready to send your PCs
on cryptic missions and gloating that all went according to plan no matter what
the result of those missions is. Sometimes it’s Jarlaxe himself, sometimes it’s
another character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might have been the book that started the trend, and it did so in a
spectacular fashion: if you pick this theme, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are the smirking drow asshole
with all the secret plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your story is pretty typical. You are a drow who survived the fall of your house
(which as usual for drow involves a massive assassination spree). The Bregan
D’Aerthe took you in and trained you, giving you a new chance to make a life for
yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve worked for them for decades, many of them here in the North’s
surface. You took part in many of the schemes that helped Luskan’s fall along,
and you witnessed the volcanic eruption. After that happened, the bulk of your
Bregan buddies left the area, since the pickings had become slim. Jarlaxe
personally ordered you to stay behind and keep an eye out in case the region
started heating up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that it did, you’re to look into everybody’s business, figure out what all
the factions in the are are up to, and find out how the Bregan D’Aerthe can
profit from their schemes. Jarlaxe is going to swing by some time to hear your
report and give new orders. So yeah, you’re acting as the cryptic smirking drow
“friend” to your fellow PCs while compiling a report for an even bigger cryptic
smirking NPC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be a Bregan D’Aerthe Spy, you must be a drow. You can be any class,
however. Any gender too, despite the “houseless males” bit above. The background
skills for this are Bluff, Dungeoneering, and Stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 1, you gain the &lt;strong&gt;Levitation&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power, which is an innate
magic power few drow manage to master. As a move action, you can fly up to 4
squares up and move 1 square horizontally. You keep hovering up there for a
turn, after which you softly descend to the ground without taking falling
damage. If something else boosts you past an altitude of 4 squares while you’re
levitating, you fall to that altitude without taking damage after resolving the
effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5, you gain &lt;strong&gt;Continuous Levitation&lt;/strong&gt;, a daily power that when used
gives you the ability to sustain Levitation until the end of the encounter. When
you sustain it, you can move an additional 3 squares vertically and 1 square
horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Level 10, when you grant combat advantage, enemies no longer gain the usual
+2 bonus to attack you. They still gain other benefits from having combat
advantage like extra damage or the ability to use specific powers, but their
attacks will be no more accurate than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optional-powers&quot;&gt;Optional Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden Stealth&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 2 encounter power that lets you roll Stealth right
along your Initiative roll if you have any cover or concealment at the start of
combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluid Steps&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 6 daily power that uses a minor action and lets you
shift 3 squares as a move action for the rest of the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spy Sight&lt;/strong&gt; might familiar to players of the Assassin’s Creed or Arkham
games. It’s a level 10 daily power that uses a minor action and gives you +5 to
Perception and Insight for the rest of the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit I’m predisposed to disliking the Bregan D’Aerthe, precisely because all
those places where they appear seem to go out of the way to picture Jarlaxe as
someone you’re supposed to love even when he betrays your party to make a few
extra gold pieces. What a card, amirite?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I have to praise this theme for its willingness to peel back the curtain
a little and put a PC in the role of the sneaky quest giver. Remove Jarlaxe from
consideration somehow and it gets even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, this is going to lend a roguish flair to any PC, making them more
mobile and stealthy. It works well for any mobile melee striker, but even
defenders are going to love the protection from flanking or the ability to get
up close and personal with those annoying fliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple Bregan Spies in a party are possible, but too many mysterious drow in
one place can end up spoiling the mystery. A whole party of them would also end
up sticking out and having a hard time moving around undetected, unless you rule
drow make up a significant part of the general surface population in your
campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Spellscarred Harbinger</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-neverwinter-spellscarred.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spellplague was the big traumatic world event that switched Forgotten Realms
from its Third Edition to its Fourth Edition state. It’s tradition for it to
have one of those every edition change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happened nearly a hundred years before our narrative present in this book,
and it featured entire continents being pulled from a parallel dimension into
this one, fundamental and traumatic changes to the way magic worked, and yes, a
plague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plague was caused by excessive exposure to those chaotically-changing
magical energies, and it caused terrible mutations and curses in its victims. A
lot of them died, some suffered permanent disfigurations, and a rare few got
weird powers to go along with it. These people were known as the
spellscarred. The major changes subsided long ago, but there are still
occasional flareups of the Spellplague even today. Feel free to insert your
favorite COVID mismanaging jokes here, though this was written a decade before
the real-world plague.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, if you take this background, you are one of the Spellplague’s
recent victims. You were lucky enough to be the kind that gains magical powers,
but that’s scant consolation since their initial manifestation blew up your home
and family. You spent a long time wandering alone and hiding your mutation,
because people notice they tend to treat you like, well, a plague
carrier. You’re not contagious, but good luck convincing them of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you were eventually helped by a priest of Ilmater, the FR god of
compassion, who directed you to the city of Helm’s Hold. The god Helm died
during the original Spellplague, but his temple there has been converted into a
hospital and shelter for the spellscarred. You spent most of your journey there
trying to figure out how you contracted the plague in the first place, without
success. Now that you’re getting close to your destination, you started having
nightmares again, about the night when you changed, and about the whole world
being consumed in blue fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(These are similar to the Faithful’s dreams, but there is no divine salvation at
the end).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon there will come a time when you can no longer hide your affliction. How
will you act then? And can Helm’s Hold really help you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no racial or class restrictions for this theme. The plague is pretty
egalitarian that way. The background skills for this theme are Arcana and Heal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 1, you get a spellscar - an obviously unnatural lesion or mutation such
as a glowing blue scar, tentacle fingers, or other such features. This gives you
a -2 penalty to defenses and saves from all Spellplague-related effects,
including attacks from spellchanged and spellscarred creatures. It also lets you
sense these creatures or Spellplague-afflicted areas if they’re within 5
squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this does mean Spellplague monsters can sense &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, but they also get that
defense and save penalty against your attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also pick one of these three abilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dimensional Shift&lt;/strong&gt;: Teleport 2 squares as a minor action once per
encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twist Fate&lt;/strong&gt;: Reroll a failed saving throw once per encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vanish&lt;/strong&gt;: Once per encounter, become invisible for a turn as a minor action.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5, you can draw on your spellscar to boost your attacks, even though it
hurts you. &lt;strong&gt;Spellscar Empowerment&lt;/strong&gt; is a daily power that you can use when you
hit with an attack. It dazes the enemy for a turn, and deals 5 + (half your
level) damage to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. The price seems to be a bit steep even for a guaranteed
daze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Level 10, you get to pick a second power from the Level 1 list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optional-powers&quot;&gt;Optional Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optional utility powers here represent an effort spent at mastering the
chaotic energies contained in your spellscar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plague Disruption&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 2 encounter power that uses a minor action. It
activates an aura 2 that lasts for a turn. Enemies inside have a -2 penalty to
attacks and “disadvantage” on power recharge rolls (i.e, they must roll the d6
twice and take the lowest result).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Torture Reality&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 6 daily power. If you’re targeted by a melee or
ranged attack you can use it as an interrupt to redirect the attack to a
creature adjacent to you. This can be another enemy or even an ally with better
defenses, but it can’t be the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morphic Recovery&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 10 daily power that turns an enemy’s weakness
into your strength. If you hit an enemy granting combat advantage to you and
you have no encounter powers left, you can use this power to recover one of
those spent encounter powers of level 7 or lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level restriction makes this less useful on paragon tier, since you’re going
to start gaining higher-level powers and replacing your lower-level ones. This
makes this power less useful outside of the Neverwinter campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like this more than Devil’s Pawn, as it makes for a more party-friendly edgy
secret. It’s even more FR-specific!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, it’s also useful to a broader variety of characters, though I
guess each one will benefit less from it than an infernal warlock would benefit
from Devil’s Pawn.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The North has always had a reputation as a hotbed for cultist activity,
especially in these dark times, but this reputation is more than a bit
exaggerated. In truth, most of those cults are groups of young nobles from minor
families who get together to appear edgy, intimidate rivals, and have really
wild parties. They start their meetings with some mock evil ceremonies for the
lulz, then proceed to drink themselves into a stupor and leave a mess for their
servants to clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing this theme means you were one of these “cultists” until
recently. Though you come from a noble lineage, your family was never wealthy
or very influential. You saw the cult as an opportunity to make useful
connections and advance your own wealth and power. Also, the parties were really
fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, you were late for a meeting. And when you arrived you found all of your
cult buddies dead, the room painted with their guts. In the center of the
carnage, the brazier you used for your pretend “diabolic rituals” burned with an
intensely hot flame that drew you in as if you were a moth. It lashed out and
etched a brand on your chest, and the pain caused you to pass out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You woke up at home, but your hope that this had been just a nightmare faded
when you noticed that the brand was still there. You somehow recognize it as a
mark of Asmodeus. You fled your native Waterdeep in a confused panic, heading to
a backwater where no one knew you: the ruined city of Neverwinter. You found
allies and protection in the other PCs, though you are reluctant to share your
dark secret with them, and haunted by dreams where you betray them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theme is the best choice for infernal warlocks who want to warlock twice as
hard, but there are no hard class prerequisites. There are no racial
prerequisites either, though since the PC is also from a minor Waterdeep noble
family they are likely to be a human, half-elf, elf, dwarf, or
eladrin. Tieflings with devil ancestors are also an interesting possibility
(guess FR tieflings are more similar to old-school ones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme skills are Bluff and Religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, these features let infernal warlocks go at it twice as hard,
and they also lend an infernal “flair” to non-warlocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 1, the devil’s mark allows you to use the &lt;strong&gt;Hellfire and Brimstone&lt;/strong&gt;
encounter power. This uses up a minor action and creates a zone in a Close Burst
2 around you. Creatures in the zone when it’s created take 5 fire damage (7 at
level 11, 10 at 21). Anyone inside afterwards takes a -2 penalty to all attack
rolls and defenses. The zone lasts for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The damage from Hellfire and Brimstone feels a bit low, but it’s automatic. And
the attack/defense penalty is useful for everyone at all levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5, you gain a +4 to Diplomacy to interact with devils, and people or
creatures devoted to them (like diabolists or duergar). The brand exerts a pull
on them and draws them to you, whether you want to or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 10, you gain 10 Fire Resistance. If you already have fire resistance
from other sources (such as being a tiefling) it increases by 5 instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optional-powers&quot;&gt;Optional Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fiction here is that you trade a bit of your soul to learn these powers (or
to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; the level 10 one), but that doesn’t have any more mechanical impact
than other infernal warlock powers. All of them also grant you additional
benefits if you’re an infernal pact warlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traitor’s Brand&lt;/strong&gt; is a Level 2 daily power that can be used as a reaction when
an enemy within 5 squares hits you. You cause all creatures adjacent to that
enemy to take 1d6 fire damage. Add your Int modifier to this roll if you have
the Infernal Pact feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Int isn’t usually a high attribute for infernal warlocks, so the bonus is likely
to be low. But hey, it’s automatic damage, so every point helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shielding Hellfire&lt;/strong&gt; is a Level 6 daily power that uses a minor action. It’s a
stance that envelops you in dark infernal flames. This gives you a +4 power
bonus to Stealth and Resist 5 Fire. If you already have fire resistance, it
increases that by 5 instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have an Infernal Pact, whenever your Warlock’s Curse is triggered the
stance also gives you a +4 power bonus on damage rolls from fire attacks until
the end of your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pit Fiend Harbinger&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 10 daily power that uses a minor action, and
represents you fully embracing the power of your brand. In other words, you turn
into Devilman: your skin hardens into blackened scales and you grow wings and
horns. This gives you a +2 power bonus to AC, a fly speed equal to your ground
speed, and fire resistance equal to 5 + (your level). As usual, if you already
have fire resistance it gets increased by 5 instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of the transformation is that you can’t spend healing surges and
you must make an attack on your turn each round or take damage equal to your
level at the end of the turn. This damage cannot be prevented or reduced in any
way. Warlocks already want to be attacking every turn anyway, but this could be
a problem if the last enemy falls before they can attack that turn, or if an
enemy prevents them from attacking somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this lasts for a turn but can be sustained with more minor actions. If
you have an Infernal Pact, you gain 10 temporary HP every time you sustain the
power, which neatly remedies or mitigates both downsides of this power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feels like an ironic take on the “edgy but not evil” trope, since a PC with
this theme &lt;em&gt;thought&lt;/em&gt; they were that but then it turned out their pretend cult
drew the attention of actual cosmic evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can still be an involuntary wielder of infernal magics if you stick with
just the features, but by default there’s nothing “involuntary” about the
optional utilities: they represent you willingly trading bits of your soul away
for more power. And both the level 6 and 10 powers seem like a very tempting
choice for an infernal pact warlock, be they full- or multi-class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think multiple PCs with this theme in a party would work out. The
default inciting incident is very specific, which means all of the Pawn PCs
would have been present there. Them being in the same party set ups an
unsustainable tension between “no one must know!” and “this one
knows!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the more Devil’s Pawns you have together, the higher the chance one of
them would succumb to the temptation of embracing these powers, dragging the
others down along with them. An all-Pawn party might start with the best of
intentions, but it would turn into an evil campaign quite soon. I’m not sure I’d
allow it in a group at all. If someone really wanted to play a warlock, I’d try
to convince them to take the Fey Pact instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a bit of lore elsewhere that claims most PC infernal warlocks are
following an esoteric tradition based on &lt;em&gt;stealing&lt;/em&gt; power from Hell, which
allows them to wield infernal powers without imperiling their soul and could
explain why devils generally dislike the character instead of being drawn to
them. Separated from its story bits, this theme could represent a warlock who
gained their powers through the more traditional path of making deals with
devils. They are more powerful than a theme-less warlock, but also more evil.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Scion of Shadow</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-neverwinter-shadow-scion.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned the Netherese several times already, and now it’s time to view
the theme most directly connected to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we know that there was this ancient human empire named Netheril, that
it was ruled by archmages, and that it really liked building flying islands. We
also know that it fell overnight due to Shenanigans that caused its signature
magic to stop working and caused all of those islands to fall from the sky. And
we’ve also seen (spoilers!) that one of these islands fell on the Neverwinter
Wood. This island is named Xinlenal and it happens to be the first one ever
built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I think that either in the 4e FR book or somewhere near the end of third
edition, you had this metaplot event where the survivors of ancient Netheril
started coming back. Turns out another one of their island cities survived the
fall by crossing over into the Shadowfell, much like the eladrin did with the
Feywild. They spent all this time there, and were mutated by the plane’s
energies. Now they’re returning to the world bent on ruling it again, and are
engaged in sinister conspiracies the world over. These people consider
themselves heirs to Netheril and call themselves Shadovar. They’re fascists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, there are Shadovar in the Neverwinter Wood, trying to repair
Xinlenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a PC with this theme, you used to be one of them. Your early education
contained a lot of fascist drivel about how the Netherese were superior to all
other peoples of the world, and how they were going to reclaim their rightful
place at the top of the societal food chain once they returned. You were
assigned a post in the first scouting expeditions into the world, and fell in
love with all the warmth and sunlight you saw there. You also interacted with
plenty of supposedly “inferior” people that quickly dispelled the bullshit put
into your head by the Shadovar leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You volunteered for a post at the location farthest from the center of Shadovar
power - Neverwinter. You managed to vanish shortly after arriving here, and now
live in the city, keeping your past a secret. But lately you’ve been seeing
signs and hearing rumors that tell you the Shadovar presence here is
increasing. The only thing that would get them this riled up is a repairable
flying city. If there really is one here (spoiler: there is) and they manage to
make it fly, then this could become a new major center for the Shadovar, and
you’d never escape them again. You need to stop them, if only to ensure you can
live a peaceful life here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no class restrictions for this theme, but Scions of Shadow can only be
one of human, shadar-kai, or shade. Those last two represent whose bloodlines
were affected by the Shadowfell, or who were mutated directly. I think
Shadar-kai get a full playable treatment in the Gloomwrougth supplement, and
Shades appear in Heroes of Shadow. Even if you’re human, you’re still edgier
than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The associated background skills are Arcana, Bluff, and Stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features here are all about your heritage brings you closer to the shadows,
even though you have chosen the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 1 you gain &lt;strong&gt;Eyes of Night&lt;/strong&gt;. This daily power gives you Blindsight 10
for a turn when used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5, your healing surge value increases by 4 wherever you’re in dim light
or darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 10, you gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff and Stealth checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;utility-powers&quot;&gt;Utility Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More shadow magic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flitting Shadow&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 2 encounter power that can be used when you
reappear at the end of a teleport. The power makes you assume a shadow form for
a turn. This gives you Insubstantial, Phasing and Vulnerable 5 Radiant, and lets
you make checks to hide when you have partial cover or concealment from any
source, including from standing behind your allies. Shadar-kai get a teleport
encounter power, and classes like warlocks and swordmages can often teleport as
well. If you can’t teleport easily, this is worthless to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binding Shade&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 6 encounter power that can be used after you hit
with an attack. After the attack is fully resolved, you gain partial concealment
and combat advantage against its target until the end of your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dancing Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 10 daily power that lets you teleport 6 squares
when used. Until the end of the encounter, you can teleport 3 squares at will
with a move action. In all cases, you must appear in a square of dim light or
darkness. This also makes that level 2 power look a lot more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impression&quot;&gt;Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very edgy. The Level 5 feature and Level 10 power are awesome in a party that
doesn’t need bright light to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shadovar/Netherese are a little less horrible than the Red Wizards, but only
a little. I wonder if you can capture their restored flying island and use it to
fight the finished Thayan fortress in a giant &lt;del&gt;robot&lt;/del&gt; magical structure battle.&lt;/p&gt;
