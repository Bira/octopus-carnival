        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Character Themes Introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 - Character Options is the one players will be most interested in, and
the reason the book strongly recommends creating new characters to play a
Neverwinter campaign. It’s divided into four major sections: Character Themes,
Racial Backgrounds, New Domains, and the Bladesinger class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll introduce the concept of character themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-theme&quot;&gt;What is a Theme?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Character Themes are described here as the “third pillar” that defines your
character alongside race and class. I also describe them as the “thing” you have
in your Heroic Tier, just like Paragon Paths are the “thing” in Paragon and Epic
Destinies are the “thing” in Epic. They were first introduced in Dark Sun, and I
think we also got a few generic ones in Dragon before this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, themes are meant to give each character special knowledge and social ties
that firmly ground them in the Neverwinter campaign. Unlike a character class, a
theme is a thing that always exists and is acknowledged in the setting. People
will never really call you “a fighter”, but they will definitely notice if you
happen to be the lost heir to the throne of Neverwinter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from these narrative hooks, a theme also has several mechanical
widgets. At levels 1, 5 and 10, you gain a &lt;strong&gt;Feature&lt;/strong&gt; specified by your theme,
which gets added on top of everything you already gain from your class. It gives
you access to a few optional &lt;strong&gt;utility powers&lt;/strong&gt; which you can take instead of a
class power at levels 2, 6 and 10. And it also works like the &lt;strong&gt;backgrounds&lt;/strong&gt;
from the Dungeon Master’s Guide 2: each theme lists a handful of skills, and you
pick one. If it’s already a class skill you get a +2 bonus to it. If it’s not
you can make it into a class skill, and become able to choose it during
character creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These features and powers can act to reinforce a character’s mechanical roles,
or to broaden it in ways that weren’t possible before. The narrative bits can
provide excellent reasons for the party to work together beyond the usual “you
all meet in a tavern”. They’re not exclusive either. Several PCs can pick the
same theme, and you could theoretically have a party where everyone does
that. Some of the themes are better for this than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, themes are entirely optional. A heroic-tier character without a
theme would be just as viable. In practice, I’ve never seen anyone refuse to
choose a theme once they became widely available. A hypothethical edition that
refined the concepts of 4e would probably include them right in the PHB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few posts will be dedicated to looking at the Neverwinter Campaign
Setting themes in detail, and we’ll start with the most spectacular one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another introductory chapter that goes into a little more detail about
the setting, but not too much more. It starts with a summary of the relevant
places in the region, then moves on to the obligatory super-long historical
timeline, and ends by offering campaign advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;neverwinter&quot;&gt;Neverwinter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite assuring the reader that no knowledge of the wider Forgotten Realms,
this section kind of assumes you’re familiar with the region already, probably
from reading the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting. Having played the
Neverwinter Nights games was enough for me, but as they’re very much In the Past
at this point I would have preferred if they assumed no prior knowledge and had
a more basic summary of the region. In the following paragraphs I try to
summarize it for people who wouldn’t necessarily have prior FR kwowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neverwinter is a coastal city-state located in a region referred to as “The
North”, with seems to be a typical Frozen North type of deal but with less
vikings. It’s built on the mouth of the Neverwinter River, which is warmed by
underground heat sources and thus never freezes. This makes the city’s port
viable year-round, and brings it great wealth from trade. A series of canny
lords invested this wealth to make a solid industrial base for the city and
strengthen its defenses. It became a beacon of prosperity and stability in a
dangerous region full of monsters and slumbering ancient threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer games end up being mostly about keeping it that way, but in this
book all of this is in the distant past. The Neverwinter in our book is a
destroyed city struggling to get back on its feet and threatened by foreign
interests and evil conspiracies alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Forgotten Realms setting has a tradition of marking edition transitions with
world-shaking metaplot events, which usually try to give in-setting explanations
for why the rules changed. They tend to make lasting changes to the world’s
geography and pantheon, usually involving the death of the current goddess of
magic. The big change that heralded 4e was The Spellplague, which caused a bunch
of horrible mutations and a planar conjunction that brought in a whole continent
from a parallel dimension. That was a hundred years ago, and it actually didn’t
affect Neverwinter all that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What destroyed the city was the eruption of the nearby Mount Hotenow, about
thirty years ago. The eruption caused a river of pyroclastic magma to flow
through the city, killing half its population outright and leveling whole
districts. Over the next decades, the people who fled the city began to return,
along with new waves of opportunists who came to loot and decided to stay, and
together they’ve managed to start rebuilding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still plenty of scars from the eruption, including a huge chasm torn
into the earth, but Neverwinter managed to rebuild enough that it drew the
attention of one Dagult Neverember. This guy is one of the Lords of Waterdeep, a
big metropolis to the south, and he has an expansionist streak a mile wide. He
arrived with a dubious lineage claim and a mercenary army, and then declared
himself the Lord Protector of Neverwinter, clearly intent on adding the city to
his personal domain. The people who live here are divided over whether that’s a
good or a bad thing, and it’s one of the main plots of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-nearby-locations&quot;&gt;Other Nearby Locations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several other places in the region should be familiar to Neverwinter Nights
players, though the combined damage from the Spellplague and the eruption means
they’re generally in a worse situation than they were back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of smaller towns and cities have simply been emptied or abandoned.  Port
Llast became a ghost town after its port was ruined by the appearance of the
nearby continent of Abeir. The mages that ran Luskan were killed off by Drizzt
in some novel, and now the city is just the pirate-riddled cesspool it always
appeared to be. Other towns and locations that were important because they
facilitated regional trade were abandoned after the destruction of Neverwinter
halted that trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mysterious Neverwinter Wood now contains both an eladrin city returned from
the Feywild (Sharandar), an ancient sky island crawling with remnants of its
original owners returned from the Shadowfell (Xinlenal), &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an incomplete
necromantic fortress of unspeakable evil inhabited by people trying to complete
it (the Dread Ring). The Mere of Dead Men has grown bigger and more dangerous,
making it harder for supplies or help to arrive by land from the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are legends of some ancient dwarven city named Gauntlgrym, but no one has
managed to find it yet. And then you have your standard stretches of hills and
mountains infested with ogres and dragons. The general thrust of this section is
that the Frozen North has gotten even more “frontier-ish” and dangerous than it
already was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;regional-history&quot;&gt;Regional History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Neverwinter is extremely focused on the region’s current situation, it
wouldn’t be a FR setting book if it didn’t include a historical timeline
stretching back tens of thousands of years. I’ll try to summarize this whole
thing and focus on the bits that are relevant to today’s adventurers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In very ancient times this region was dominated by an &lt;strong&gt;elven empire&lt;/strong&gt;
(Iliyanbruen), which after thousands of years of hegemony fell after fighting
back an enormous orcish invasion. Most of its inhabitants called it quits and
“traveled West” much like Tolkien’s elves do, but some of them fled into the
Feywild instead. These refugees built a city over there, and this is relevant
because that city has returned to the world and is the region’s main source of
eladrin characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the time of the elven empire, you also had a &lt;strong&gt;dwarven empire&lt;/strong&gt;
(Delzoun), which had several big underground cities in here. Its fabled capital
was Gauntlgrym, which started out as a big mine and got converted into a city
later. The empire collapsed after the big orcish invasion and the underground
mind flayer invasion that followed. This is relevant because it leaves a whole
bunch of lost dwarven ruins underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also had a &lt;strong&gt;human empire&lt;/strong&gt; (Netheril) that was ruled by archmages who loved
to show their power by building flying islands. This one fell quite suddenly due
to Metaplot Shenanigans elsewhere in the world, and one of their flying islands
crashed into the Neverwinter Wood. It’s still there! The survivors from this
empire are the ancestors of most of the present-day humans native to the
region. This includes the Uthgardt barbarians, but also other groups. Some of
these survivors settled the city of Illusk, which would become present-day
Luskan after being sacked and rebuilt a few dozen times. Neverwinter would be
founded much later by other descendants of Netheril who first settled islands to
the west and then sailed here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Modern-day developments” section includes quite a few spoilers, so players
beware! I do find it cute that it made a point to mention the plot of the first
Neverwinter Nights as a significant historical event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after the Spellplague pulled the Realms into Fourth Edition, the
descendants of Netheril survivors who had fled to the Plane of Shadow came back
and started conspiring to take over the region by infiltrating Neverwinter’s
power structure. They got sidetracked when another conspiracy crashed into
theirs, but are still hanging around the ruins of that flying city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That crashing conspiracy is a doozy, by the way: a bunch of evil wizards (the
Red Wizards of Thay) tried to build a necromantic fortress of ultimate evil in
the Neverwinter Wood and &lt;em&gt;caused the volcanic eruption&lt;/em&gt; to destroy Neverwinter
and use the deaths to power the fortress. Their plan was foiled (probably in a
novel), so the fortress was never completed. It’s still there,
half-finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gauntlgrym is lost but still inhabited, and over the last few centuries it
changed hands several times. The current owners are duergar. Its big secret is
that it houses a slumbering primordial (Maegera the Inferno), who in ancient
times was used as a geothermal power source by the dwarves and the mages of old
Illusk, who cooperated on the operation of the power plant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-a-neverwinter-campaign&quot;&gt;Running a Neverwinter Campaign&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section describes how the book works as a tool for running a campaign. It
restates much of what was said in the introduction, and it does so in a way that
makes it clear it’s taking a different tack from your traditional FR supplement
or adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we already know, it focuses on the Neverwinter region; it also only includes
details that are useful sources of inspiration rather than trying to list the
names of every innkeeper in the city. The characters presented in the book are
active and won’t sit around waiting to respond to the PCs. The PCs, in turn,
will have access to character themes that will get them involved in the campaign
right away. The campaign is also open-ended - it doesn’t assume an end state
that the characters must work towards. PCs are free to set their own goals,
confident that their actions will have an actual impact on events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a text box here that should make critics of previous versions of the
setting quite happy: it’s titled “Killable Villains”. It says that while it
might make sense to stat up the main villains of the campaign as epic threats
due to the scope and reach of their machinations, this often results in the
players feeling like they can never truly defeat those villains until they are
themselves epic. Until then, they remain trapped in conflict with an endless
series of underlings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, every opponent here, even the main villains was given stats
that are “within reach” of heroic tier adventurers. While some of those major
villains might make for tough boss fights for 10th-level characters, those
characters still have a chance of defeating them. Of course, GMs who want to
stretch their campaigns beyond the heroic tier are free to level those villains
up or use other appropriate stat blocks for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GM advice for running the campaign centers mostly around being flexible. There
are a lot of plot threads flying around, so it’s okay to remind players of where
things stand (from their PC’s point of view) if they get lost. It’s also okay to
&lt;em&gt;change the facts&lt;/em&gt; of the campaign if your players end up coming to a “wrong”
conclusion during their investigations - particularly if their theories are more
fun than what’s written on the book! And finally, it’s okay to do what feels
right even if it contradicts what’s been written. Don’t sweat it if you forget
some detail and end up changing it in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the book really recommends that players make new characters for this
campaign, so that they can take advantage of the several themes available to
them. It does have some advice for bringing existing characters into the
campaign, but my feeling is that this is a very sub-optimal approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not the biggest knower or enjoyer of the broader Forgotten Realms setting,
but I do have good memories from the games, so a lot of the places mentioned
here were familiar to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved the emphasis the book put, both in its introduction and here, on the
fact that your PCs will get the chance to do important and world-shaking things
on their own, and that even the top villains of the piece have no plot armor and
are defeatable. There’s a reason why I often refer to an excess of invincible
official NPCs as “The Elminster problem”, and I’m happy to know they’ll be
trying to avoid it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The material here does a lot to bring this region closer to the “points of
light” model prevalent in 4e, as a lot of what used to be safe places are just
&lt;em&gt;gone&lt;/em&gt;, and there are a lot more dangerous ones. There’s quite a lot going on in
the Neverwinter Wood, and inside Neverwinter proper as well. I could have done
without that timeline section and its attempts at summarizing novels, but I
suspect we’ll see more details about the region’s present situation soon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I started writing this post, I was convinced the &lt;strong&gt;Neverwinter Campaign
Setting&lt;/strong&gt; was the last setting book for D&amp;amp;D 4th Edition. Turns out there were
two more published in the following year, one for Undermountain and another for
Menzonberranzan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t even remember these books existed, which I guess makes sense since they
seem to have a much narrower potential audience. Neverwinter, in contrast, is
probably the most famous place in the Forgotten Realms, and at the time of this
book’s release in 2011 it was even known to a lot of people who were outside of
the FR fan community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because by that point in time the city had already been the setting for
two successful computer games! Neverwinter Nights came out in 2002. It’s the
game that put Bioware on the map, and it didn’t take long for it to develop a
huge trove of fan-created modules and expansions, in addition to the official
ones it got in the years following its release. The sequel was developed by
Obsidian and came out in 2006, and though it was less open to fan additions it
kept getting expansions up to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there was also the &lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt; big game featuring Neverwinter, the MMORPG of the
same name. It was developed concurrently with the book, something the book
itself makes a point of advertising in a side box in its introduction. I think
the book came out a little earlier than the game, because delays are a fact of
life in video game development, but they’re much more integrated than I thought
at first. The MMO is still active as of this writing, over a decade after its
launch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Neverwinter Campaign Setting is also perfectly capable of
standing on its own merits. It places a much greater emphasis on the “campaign”
part of “campaign setting”, which was a novel approach when it came out and
influenced the presentation of most 5e campaign books too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-books-introduction&quot;&gt;The Book’s Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first thing we see after the table of contents is an Introduction
chapter that explains its approach in a very concise manner. The book cover the
city of Neverwinter and its immediate surroundings, focusing on a small area of
a larger, already-published setting (Forgotten Realms). It’s not a static atlas
or travelogue - it’s a tool for running a campaign. It’s meant to be easy for a
GM to customize, and its player options help build PCs that are deeply involved
with several big plots that can make permanent changes to the setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is geared towards the Heroic tier (levels 1-10), so all threats and
challenges in the area are appropriate for characters of those levels. This
includes the main villains of the piece. Your PCs will not be stuck fighting the
grunts and flunkies of some epic-level villain. They will get to face legendary
threats on their own, without any overpowered NPCs around to bail them out or to
steal the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m paraphrasing the book here, and I like that these assurances are right on
the first page. It’s an important thing to include when dealing with the
Forgotten Realms, which has been traditionally full of untouchable epic villains
and scene-stealing epic NPCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The also emphasizes that the situation presented in its pages is a starting
point - it’s a situation that will quickly begin changing as soon as the actual
game starts. The PCs are not only expected but &lt;em&gt;encouraged&lt;/em&gt; to get in there and
meddle with things. There is plenty of intrigue going on and adventure hooks are
everywhere, but the story itself is not on rails. Just as the PCs are encouraged
to change things, the GM is encouraged to adapt to their actions and not try to
force a pre-determined outcome. This is a very nice sentiment! Let’s see if they
manage to uphold it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules-wise, the book is going to make heavy use of character themes. Themes were
introduced in the Dark Sun Campaign Setting book as a new “thing” to complement
your class in the Heroic tier, just like paragon paths and epic destinies do
later. Dark Sun had several Athas-specific themes, and I think Dragon Magazine
introduced a few other more generic ones later. Neverwinter presents its own set
of themes, which are even more specific than Dark Sun’s - each of them ties into
one of the major plot threads they describe here, and some of them even make the
PC in question the “main character” of that thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for required book, the core set is a given - that can either be the PHB+DMG
duo or the equivalent Essentials set of Rules Compendium and “Heroes of…”
books, though it’s going to place a bit more emphasis on the latter. In both
cases the Monster Vault is recommended over the Monster Manual, and the
Forgotten Realms books (Player’s Guide and Campaign Setting) are nice-to-haves
in order to flesh out the wider setting and give players a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next few posts, we’ll be looking a the book chapter by chapter. Some
chapters my take up more than one post. This should take a lot less time than
the monster books did, but I hope you enjoy it just the same.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fuzzy turns in GURPS Combat</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As you might know from reading here before, I hang out on the RPG.net forums a
lot. Whenever a discussion about GURPS starts there, some people often complain
they feel intimidated or annoyed by the 1-second combat turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other games tend to have a less granular concept of turn duration and of what
exactly constitutes an action, so players used to them usually expect to be able
to do one “complete thing” in each turn without bothering with detailed setup
steps. For example, a ranged attack with a bow in D&amp;amp;D takes a single action that
includes aiming, shooting, drawing a new arrow, and nocking it, all of which are
distinct steps in GURPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually like 1-second turns and will be keeping them in my games, but I
present here a possible way to make them fuzzier for those groups who don’t
enjoy them as much. This is a fairly fundamental change to the base GURPS
system, probably lends itself better to games that used simplified combat rules
instead of things like detailed hex maps and range measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also helps combat feel a bit more like what you might see in action movies
or similar media, which tend to slow down things to make them easier to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fuzzy-combat-in-gurps&quot;&gt;Fuzzy Combat in GURPS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under this rule, a combat round is no longer exactly 1 second long. Now it takes
an unspecified amount of time between 5 and 10 seconds long - enough for
everyone to act once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single-maneuver actions that can be resolved in a 1-second turn under the
original rules still take 1 turn to resolve here. This includes most melee and
ranged attacks, movement, and the Aim and Evaluate maneuvers. Advantages such as
Extra Attack and techniques like Rapid Strike work exactly as written, with the
same limitations, but read “seconds” as “turns”. The RoF stat retains its value
for all weapons that have it, but read it as “shots per turn” instead of “shots
per second”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actions that would take multiple consecutive maneuvers over several turns to
perform now take 1 turn per 10 seconds or fraction thereof they would originally
take. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swapping magazines on a modern gun took 3 seconds, so now it takes 1 turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Reloading a musket took 40 seconds, so it takes 4 turns now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any spell that would require less than 10 seconds to cast can be cast in a
single turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Searching through your pack for an item took 2d seconds. As the average of
that roll is less than 10, it only requires a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Picking a lock takes a minute, which means 6 turns. Accepting a -5 penalty to
do it in 30 seconds means it takes 3 turns. This makes it possible to do
during a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fast-Draw skill now encompasses a series of actions taken to speed up a
given process. It can reduce the time an appropriate action takes by 1 turn, to
a minimum of 0. So you can still use it to draw a weapon and attack on the same
turn, or to reload a pistol and keep firing on the same turn. That musket is
still going to take 3 turns before it can fire again. You might want to make it
Average instead of Easy since a single roll covers a larger set of actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes make characters such as archers and wizards more powerful in
combat, since the number of things they can do over a given amount of turns has
increased, while melee-focused character can still take more or less the same
number of actions. Note that I have &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; tested how these changes interact
with the magic system, so I can’t measure how much of an impact it’s going to
have on spellcasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-we-avoided&quot;&gt;Things we Avoided&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we didn’t attempt to increase the effective number of actions by the
same multiplier as the turn duration. If a character could attack every second
under the standard rules, they don’t get to make 5-10 attacks in a single turn
here. Aiming or Evaluating for multiple seconds gave you extra bonuses, but you
don’t get them automatically here - you must perform those maneuvers for the
same number of turns. Our goal is to remove multi-step complex procedures, not
to keep counting seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is more abstract and perhaps less realistic, and that is the point. If
you want to keep tracking events second-by-second, stick with the standard
rules.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I'm done with Threats to the Nentir Vale! Now what?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Wolf Runners were the last monster entry in the book, and after that there’s
only a glossary index. So we’re done with this book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And not only that, we’re also done with my big project of reading all of the
main D&amp;amp;D 4th monster books. I remember I started it January 1st 2019, with the
first posts going into an RPG.net thread and appearing here shortly
afterwards. So it took us a little over 4 years, 4 months, and 15 days to get it
all done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing all of this was an interesting experience. The idea for the project came
at a time when I was having a bit of a hard time coming up with subjects for
posts to this blog, mainly because I was getting anxious about writing good
articles. I’d think of something, then I’d begin writing, and then I’d get
blocked or mired in an endless round of revisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writting commentary on D&amp;amp;D monsters, in contrast, felt extremely easy. I could
sit down, cover a bunch of entries, and have them ready for a regular release
schedule. Granted, I had a hard time sticking to any sort of schedule for most
of the project’s runtime, but I think I did a pretty good job of it in Threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people who read these entries here in the blog were probably 4e fans
instead of the usual GURPS crowd, unless they happened to follow my RSS feed
directly or something like that. None of those posts had a GURPS tag, so they
didn’t appear in the aggregator I’m a member of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still want to have a ready source of posts for Octopus Carnival, and I also
really like the conversations I had in the RPG.net threads for the project, so
I’m going to begin a new Let’s Read. There’s voting going on in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/lets-read-threats-to-the-nentir-vale.904788/&quot;&gt;RPG.net
thread&lt;/a&gt; for Threats, with the following candidates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neverwinter Campaign Setting&lt;/strong&gt; for 4e. I have it, and I have opinions about
it, so it’s a good subject.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hell’s Rebels&lt;/strong&gt; for Pathfinder, with commentary about converting it to other
systems. Extremely convenient because I’ve already written a lot about it in
this blog. Might also give me more incentive to actually finish the adventure
path too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game&lt;/strong&gt;: A large enough effort that I’d need to
give it serious thought. It would probably not be a page-by-page affair, but
it &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; merit the GURPS tag.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the thread linked above if you want to vote or comment on any of the
entries. Otherwise sit back and enjoy the knowledge that there will soon be a
new thing to occupy your usual Let’s Read slots.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last entry in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the Raven Roost bandits have some competition! The Wolf Runners are
another of the bandit gangs who prey on the Trade Road between Fallcrest and
Hammerfast. They have this name because their leader, Sylish Kreed, has somehow
gained the loyalty of a pack of grey and dire wolves, and has them aid the gang
when they attack caravans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kreed presents himself as the dashing rogue type, and tries to be civil and
good-humored when dealing with his victims. The gang vastly prefers to take its
victims’ valuables without a fight, and to leave them alive and free to go. This
both lessens the heat upon them and gives them the opportunity to rob the same
people again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The counter-balance to this, however, is that Kreed is a terribly sore loser. If
he ends up on the losing end of a battle, he’ll become sullen and obsessed with
taking revenge on whoever beat him. He doesn’t necessarily want to kill the
offender, but he won’t rest until he’s re-established his superiority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sort of alpha-asshole behavior and the wolves might have tipped you off to
the gang’s big secret: Kreed is a werewolf, having caught lycanthropy from a
bite a few years back. He can transform at will most of the time, but for three
days on every full moon he loses control, changes into a wolf, and goes off to
live with his pack until his rational mind returns. Kreed’s condition is not
public knowledge, though I guess his gang-mates know of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His main lieutenant certainly does: that’s Eveni Redblade, a tiefling whom he
rescued from the Dark Drake of the Moon Hills some time ago, and who as a result
is completely loyal to him. Speaking of loyalty, the wolves are also loyal to
Kreed personally, though they tolerate the gang and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolf Runner ambushes tend to consist of a troop of archers hidden in the woods
off to both sides of the road, while Kreed and his wolf pack block the path and
handle the intimidation plus melee fighting that proves necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the unusual nature of their leader and his “understanding” with those
wolves, the Wolf Runners are a typical bandit gang that uses typical bandit stat
blocks. The wolves are also typical, using standard stats for grey and dire
wolves from the Monster Vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, we get stats for Kreed, Eveni, and the Runners’ archers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wolf-runner-swiftarrow&quot;&gt;Wolf Runner Swiftarrow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the wolves acting as melee muscle, many of the Runners focus on archery
instead. Swiftarrows are Level 5 Artillery with 50 HP. They have decent melee
and ranged attacks with a &lt;strong&gt;short swords&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;longbow&lt;/strong&gt;, and their &lt;strong&gt;Close
Shot&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver lets them make a free bow attack whenever an enemy moves
adjacent to them, without provoking attacks of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eveni-redblade&quot;&gt;Eveni Redblade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tiefling lieutenant is a Level 5 Skirmisher with 60 HP. She’s always &lt;strong&gt;On
The Move&lt;/strong&gt;, ending any slowing or immobilization effects on her at the start of
her turns. She also does extra damage against targets granting combat advantage
to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eveni fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Longsword&lt;/strong&gt; whose basic strikes let her shift 1 square
before or after the attack, and she can also use &lt;strong&gt;Dazing Strikes&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge
6+) that as the name implies damage and daze for a turn. Rounding out her
arsenal is the default &lt;strong&gt;Infernal Wrath&lt;/strong&gt; power tieflings get, which lets her do
a bit of automatic fire damage to someone who hits her once per encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a standard mobile combatant package. Eveni works best with plenty of
people to set up flanks and other advantageous situations for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sylish-kreed&quot;&gt;Sylish Kreed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The (wolf)man of the hour is a Level 6 Elite Skirmisher with 144 HP. He has all
the werewolf signature traits, starting with &lt;strong&gt;Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt;, which as usual
shuts down for a turn if he takes damage from silvered weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can also &lt;strong&gt;Change Shape&lt;/strong&gt; to assume human, wolf, or hybrid forms. In human or
hybrid form he can use a &lt;strong&gt;Greatsword&lt;/strong&gt; that provides standard basic attacks. In
wolf or hybrid form, he can &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt;. The claw does more damage to
bloodied targets and lets Kreed shift &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt; squares on a hit. The bite knocks
targets prone and exposes them to werewolf moon frenzy as described in the
Monster Vault. The &lt;strong&gt;Bloodmoon Fury&lt;/strong&gt; ability lets him either attack twice with
the sword or make a claw and a bite attack on the same action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the Wolf Runners a lot more than I like the lizardfolk, that’s for
sure. I also think it’s interesting that the Wolf Runners have a lot of other
factions to worry about even if the PCs never fight them directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they really operate on the Trade Road, they’re in direct competition with the
Raven Roost gang and/or the Blackfang Gnolls, both of which are a lot more
murderous than themselves. If we instead move them to King’s Road, they’re going
to contend with the Iron Circle in Harkenwold and possibly with the Daggerburg
Goblins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the Wolf Runners presented here are Unaligned, so you can easily play
them as rogues with hearts of gold and have them as possible allies against an
unjust lord or against some of the other factions, Robin Hood-style.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Threats to the Nentir Vale: Witchlight Lizardfolk</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-witchlight-lizardfolk.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll get this out of the way first: this entry fully buys into all the tired
racist stereotypes for D&amp;amp;D humanoids. Already in its second sentence, it calls
them “primitive, tribal, cruel” and cannibalistic. I’m going to strip all of
this out and try to present a less bad version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several lizardfolk tribes living in the Witchlight Fens. A good number
of them are under the rule of the dragon Shadowmire, but not all. All of them
are territorial and tend to distrust outsiders, as mentioned in the Monster
Manual 1 version of their writeups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Witchlight Fens got this name because the local fauna includes several
different times of “witchlights”, mundane or magical creatures that are capable
of producing spheres of glowing light visible in the distance. One species,
known as “fastlights”, usually tries to flee from living creatures, but the
lizardfolk of the Fens have learned to trap and tame them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three largest tribes in the area are the &lt;strong&gt;Brackmarsh&lt;/strong&gt;, who
enthusiastically swore loyalty to Shadowmire and as a result have been able to
conquer much of the northern and western portions of the Fens, driving their
rivals out; the &lt;strong&gt;Mistkillers&lt;/strong&gt; who live in the eastern sector and feud with the
Daggerburg goblins, only occasionally obeying the dragon; and the
&lt;strong&gt;Crushwater&lt;/strong&gt;, who live in the fens’ central region and fiercely resist
draconic dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of them are likely to receive PCs who don’t belong to the same tribe with
open arms, but I think it should at least be possible to negotiate with
them. The Brackmarshes or other tribes you add that are more directly controlled
by Shadowmire are even less likely to be friendly to people who don’t also serve
the dragon, and will probably make a good portion of his ground troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the tribes mentioned here have a mix of all three standard lizardfolk
ethnicities, and can contain a mix of the standard stat blocks from the Monster
Vault or other sources. We also get a new batch of stats that apply to them
specifically and can be used elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the lizardfolk here have a speed of 6 and Swamp Walk, and have no
special senses or resistances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lizardfolk-mire-scout&quot;&gt;Lizardfolk Mire Scout&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick but fragile scout with a pet fastlight. It’s a level 3 Minion
Skirmisher. It fights in melee with &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; that let it shift 2 squares as an
effect, but prefers to keep away and harass enemies with &lt;strong&gt;Fastlight Shots&lt;/strong&gt;
that do radiant damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lizardfolk-bog-walker&quot;&gt;Lizardfolk Bog Walker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beefier warrior who’s more at home than usual in the water. This is a Level 3
Soldier with 44 HP and a swim speed of 4 in addition to its normal movement
described above. The bog walker can make basic &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; attacks, but it prefers
to grab its does and drown them with &lt;strong&gt;Drag Down&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can only be done if the bog walker is in water at least 1 square deep, and
doesn’t already have a grabbed victim. It’s a melee attack vs. Reflex, and on a
hit it damages and grabs the target (escape DC 13). Until the grab ends, the
target must make a DC 13 Endurance check at the start of their turns, and take
10 damage if that check fails. Even on a miss with the initial attack, the
target is still immobilized for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 damage per turn is a lot for the early Heroic tier. PCs are at a real risk of
drowning if they have a run of bad luck on their rolls and don’t get help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lizardfolk-fen-spy&quot;&gt;Lizardfolk Fen Spy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Level 4 Lurker is also proficient in the use of fastlights as a weapon.  It
can use its &lt;strong&gt;Witchlight Mists&lt;/strong&gt; ability to become invisible as an at-will
standard action, and from there it can use a ranged &lt;strong&gt;Fastlight Strike&lt;/strong&gt; to deal
heavy radiant damage, inflict ongoing 5 radiant damage, and blind (save ends
both). If it can’t become invisible again due to PC pressure, it will use basic
attacks with its &lt;strong&gt;thorn dagger&lt;/strong&gt;, which deal poison damage and inflict a -2
penalty to AC and Reflex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lizardfolk-shocker&quot;&gt;Lizardfolk Shocker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spellcaster specializing in lightning magic, it’s Level 5 Artillery with 50
HP. The shocker wields a &lt;strong&gt;Greatclub&lt;/strong&gt; in melee, and slings lightning spells at
range. There’s the single-target at will &lt;strong&gt;Witch Lightning&lt;/strong&gt;, and there’s the
encounter &lt;strong&gt;Ball of Lightning&lt;/strong&gt;, which is basically a fireball with a different
element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone hits then with a ranged or area attack, they can react with a
&lt;strong&gt;sudden jolt&lt;/strong&gt; that deals automatic lightning damage to the attacker, which
means you want to close on them fast instead of trading shots from afar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lizardfolk-dreadtail&quot;&gt;Lizardfolk Dreadtail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A warrior who believes you shouldn’t skip tail day at the gym. Dreadtails are
Level 5 Soldiers with 52 HP. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;spears&lt;/strong&gt; that damage and mark for
a turn, but they can also use Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;tail slaps&lt;/strong&gt; that do less damage but
target Reflex and knock prone on a hit. Their &lt;strong&gt;Slap Down&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver (recharge
5+) allows them to use both in a single action. If someone marks the dreadtail,
its &lt;strong&gt;Spirit Interference&lt;/strong&gt; reaction marks the offender right back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreadtails want to mark dangerous PCs, and then keep them prone with repeated
tail slaps. There’s no special ability to punish a PC who ignores the mark, but
it’s hard to fight anyone while prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lizardfolk-dreadnought&quot;&gt;Lizardfolk Dreadnought&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chieftain or lieutenant whose Large size ensures it’s a terrifying sight in
battle. It’s a Level 7 Elite Brute with 190 HP and the Leader tag. The
&lt;strong&gt;Dreadnought’s Wrath&lt;/strong&gt; is a palpable thing that acts as an aura (2) which
gives allies inside a +2 bonus to hit and damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most brutes, dreadnoughts want to be right in the thick of the melee. Their
skills make them excellent at disrupting the enemy front line and opening the
way to the squishies at the back. Their basic &lt;strong&gt;Greatclub&lt;/strong&gt; attacks do heavy
damage, push the target 2 squares, and let the dreadnought shift 2 squares to
chase the enemy. As minor actions, they can distribute &lt;strong&gt;Low Blows&lt;/strong&gt; that target
Fortitude, do the same damage, and knock prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the way is opened, they can the &lt;strong&gt;You Fight Now!&lt;/strong&gt; minor action to let an
ally within 5 squares make a free charge attack. This ally and any others who
make it through will then stick close to their boss to enjoy that attack bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lizardfolk-chief&quot;&gt;Lizardfolk Chief&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more sophisticated leader with a simpler stat block, the chief is a Level 7
Soldier with 156 HP. It fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Battleaxe&lt;/strong&gt; whose blows slow for a turn
on a hit, and can make &lt;strong&gt;Double Attacks&lt;/strong&gt; with it. If an enemy adjacent to the
chief shifts, it can attack them with a &lt;strong&gt;Tail Lash&lt;/strong&gt; that does light physical
damage and knocks prone. Once per encounter it can use &lt;strong&gt;Fighting Spirit&lt;/strong&gt; to
allow every ally in a close burst 2 to make a free basic attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chief works well as the core of the enemy front-line, using its slow and
trip powers to keep PCs from reaching its squishier buddies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lizardfolk-marsh-mystic&quot;&gt;Lizardfolk Marsh Mystic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a variant of the Bog Mystic from the Monster Vault, of a lower level and
with some abilities replaced by Witchlight-specific traits. It’s a Level 4
Controller (Leader) with 53 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its first novel trait is &lt;strong&gt;Marsh Mist&lt;/strong&gt;, a very wide aura (10!) that prevents
allies inside from being surprised and gives them a +5 to Perception and
Stealth. Its &lt;strong&gt;spear&lt;/strong&gt; can damage and slide targets 2 squares on a hit, and its
main ranged attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Fastlight Shock&lt;/strong&gt; that deals lightning and radiant
damage, and immobilizes for a turn. If the target was already immobilized, it’s
dazed instead. On a miss, it slows for a turn with no damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mystic can also cast a &lt;strong&gt;Bog Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter Area Burst 1 that deals
poison damage and dazes (save ends) on a hit. On a miss, it deals half damage
and forces targets to grant combat advantage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are excellent ambush leaders whose presence will all but guarantee the
PCs are surprised, and whose riders on their many attacks will keep them locked
down for Team Monster’s strikers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impression&quot;&gt;Final Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s good mechanical variety here, but I am very unimpressed with the book’s
default portrayal of lizardfolk. This is a big let-down after the Wandering Tower.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Threats to the Nentir Vale: Wandering Tower</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to write this entry ever since I started doing the Let’s Read
of the first Monster Manual and Monster Vault, more than four years ago. It’s my
favorite entry in the entire book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-wandering-tower.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the dawn of Nerath, a number of knights went a-questing for the fabled
Sunspire, a tower sacred to Pelor that was said to house a beautiful maiden. The
knight who found it would receive the god’s blessings and the maiden’s hand in
marriage. One such knight eventually found the tower, and went inside at the
maiden’s invitation. He was never seen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the armies of evil encircled Gardmore Abbey, they managed to get a
messenger through the siege, carrying a map to the location of their most
precious artifacts to be delivered to the Emperor of Nerath. The messenger ran
until a thunderstorm forced him to seek shelter. He found an inn he didn’t
remember seeing before, whose rotund proprietor promised he’d find all he
desired inside. That night, the messenger laid down on his bed and was never
seen again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prince Rande the Lost of Nerath gained his noble title after tracking down and
slaying a foul doppelganger. He found it disguised as a lady of noble bearing
living in a fancy manor house. He slew the creature and took her manor for
himself, moving in with his entire household. Servants and nobles alike began
disappearing one by one, giving rise to rumors that the Prince had usurped an
innocent woman and her ghost was seeking vengenace. Finally, the Prince himself
vanished along with the whole house, leaving an empty plot of land behind and
adding “The Lost” to his titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years after the fall of Nerath a group of dwarven adventures came to the Nentir
Vale seeking the Lost Tower of Fastormel. They found the tower, but their
initial attempts at gaining entry failed. An old dwarven wizard eventually
answered the door, claiming she hadn’t heard the visitors knock. She invited
them inside. The party’s rogue sensed something was wrong and tried to convince
his friends to stay out, but they didn’t listen to him. The last thing the rogue
heard before fleeing were the screams of his companions. When he later returned
there with a well-armed rescue party, the tower was nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that mimics never die of old age, and never stop growing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the Wandering Tower is a centuries-old mimic. It’s helped along by a group
of mirror mimics who play host in order to lure potential victims inside. It’s
also followed by a swarm of blood ravens who feast on any remains it
leaves. These appear in every one of the more detailed vignettes in the book
itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blood-raven-swarm&quot;&gt;Blood Raven Swarm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Large swarm of Tiny creatures, and a Level 14 Skirmisher with 138
HP. Blood Ravens are Natural Beasts, and their main reason for following the
tower is for access to easy meals. Their &lt;strong&gt;Swarm Attack&lt;/strong&gt; aura (1) deals 10
damage to enemies caught inside, and if they start their turn on the space of a
bloodied creature they can take move actions as minor actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swarm’s sole attack is &lt;strong&gt;Blood Beaks&lt;/strong&gt;, which damages the target and weakens
it for a turn if it’s bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mirror-mimic&quot;&gt;Mirror Mimic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting variant of the Impersonator Mimic from the MM3. It’s
weaker and more suitable as a hench-thing for the tower, but it also has
different psychic tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirror Mimics are Level 15 Lurkers with 118 HP. They have a ground Speed of 6
and Phasing, meaning they can move through walls. They attack with &lt;strong&gt;Slams&lt;/strong&gt;
that do decent damage, and their main mimic power is &lt;strong&gt;Body Duplication&lt;/strong&gt;. This
lets them attack the Will of an enemy. On a hit, they take the target’s form and
teleport up to 3 squares. They also create 3 duplicates of the target within 3
squares of it. The duplicates can be attacked and have the same defenses as the
mimic, but any damage destroys them. Telling them apart from the original mimic
requires a DC 35 Insight check. The mimic can make all of them move its speed
with a single minor action, and can use &lt;strong&gt;Body Transfer&lt;/strong&gt; as a minor action to
discreetly switch places with a duplicate. When it does this, its next attack
deals extra damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By a strict reading of the ability, the PCs need no rolls to pinpoint their
duplicated friend - they are only required to distinguish between the original
mimic and one of its illusory duplicates. That’s not a problem, however, because
when a duplicate is destroyed, the duplicated PC takes damage as if the mimic
had hit them with an attack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Body Duplication recharges when the mimic has no active duplicates, so keeping
it active is going to be its main priority. After that, it’s going to constantly
switch places with a copy and focus its attacks on the duplicated PC. It’s going
to be very annoying to fight unless the PCs can consistently make those Insight
rolls. If the party doesn’t have an Insight specialist, this thing is going to
punch above its weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;core-of-the-tower&quot;&gt;Core of the Tower&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wandering Tower can replicate any medium-sized building. Once its mimic
servants have lured one or more victims inside, the Tower waits until they are
at rest with their guard down, and then its core will attack them. That’s the
part that actually does the eating and digesting, and houses the being’s vital
organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core is a Huge Aberrant Magical Beast, smaller than the building it’s
mimicking (which will be part of the battle map!). The walls and furnishings of
the building remain part of the mimic and can also attack the PCs. This is
modeled in several different ways in this stat block and the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Core of the Tower is a Level 18 Solo Controller with 716 HP, a ground speed
of 6 with Phasing, Darkvision and Tremorsense 10. It’s immune to domination and
has 15 acid resistance. It’s &lt;strong&gt;One With the Tower&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning it can’t move out
of the Tower and is immune to any effects that would transport it
outside. Rounding out its Solo Survival Kit, we have the &lt;strong&gt;Undaunted&lt;/strong&gt; trait,
which downgrades any stuns inflicted on it to dazes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core fights by extending tendrils from itself and manipulating the
surrounding terrain, which is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; itself. Its basic attacks are Reach 3 and
consist of &lt;strong&gt;Slams&lt;/strong&gt; that slide the target 3 squares and &lt;strong&gt;Grabs&lt;/strong&gt; that do
almost the same amount of damage and have an escape DC of 23. It can also, as a
free action on its turn, target a grabbed PC with the &lt;strong&gt;Maw of Doom&lt;/strong&gt;, sliding
it 3 squares to a space adjacent to itself or to a wall and dealing a big chunk
of acid damage. This requires an attack roll against Fortitude, but does not end
the grab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most combat-relevant minor action the core can make is use its &lt;strong&gt;Rippling
Architecture&lt;/strong&gt; to attack every enemy in a Close Burst 5 and knock them prone on
a hit. It can also create additional doors on the map, which start out jammed
shut (break DC 25), or shapeshift into something suitably large, using the same
rules as an object mimic: can’t attack, has 10 resistance to all damage, DC 32
to notice it’s a mimic. It will likely start the fight this way, and the door
ability will be used to place any doors the PCs see when they enter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;living-wall&quot;&gt;Living Wall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a hazard that’s sure to be present on any fight against the Wandering
Tower, since it represents its non-core natural weapons. The book recommends
choosing 8 contiguous squares of wall on the map and designating them as this
hazard. Pseudopods and acidic maws extend from this wall to attack PCs when it
activates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Living Wall is a Level 18 Hazard that has slightly lower defenses than the
mimic’s core, and 25 HP per square (200 for those 8 recommended squares). It’s
very tough, being immune to necrotic, poison, psychic and ongoing damage, as
well as to all forced movement and conditions. It has Resist 10 acid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its attack is Reach 3 and though it deals only light physical damage it has
cruel riders: hit targets are pulled 1 square, restrained, and take 10 ongoing
acid damage (save ends both). It can attack two targets with one action, and
each attack can originate from any of the wall’s squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A square that takes 25 damage is destroyed and can no longer serve as the origin
point for an attack, though I guess it still blocks perception and movement. If
the core is dazed or first bloodied, the wall is disabled for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this! It really stretches the mechanics of the game to give you an
encounter against an actual building who wants to kill you. The most likely
fight against the Wandering Tower will involve every stat block in this entry:
the Core itself on a building interior map with a number of Living Wall squares,
a mirror mimic servant, and the Blood Ravens ready to attack anyone who tries to
get out. That’s a very chaotic Level 20 Encounter for 5 characters, going into
the epic levels if your party is smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth and final dragon described in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vestapalk is an adult green dragon who lairs in the Cairngorm Peaks. He’s very
typical of his demographic in that he’s an evil asshole whose favorite food is
the flesh of sapient mammals. Every time he kills an opponent he considers
worthy, he marks another scar on the inside of his right forearm to remember the
occasion. He currently has nine, most of which are ill-fated adventurers who
tried to loot his hoard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, Vestapalk used to hunt in the Stonemarch region beyond the vale,
but he’s begun flying into the Vale more and more often, which has the
population of Winterhaven in a fright. One of the reasons for this is that the
dragon has started receiving prophetic visions in his dreams. These showed him
sitting proud as the overlord of a kobold tribe, and he decided to see if there
was any truth to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most kobold tribes Vestapalk encountered ran scared from him, but one did
not. The Greenscale tribe was led by a wyrmpriest named Tiktag, who had been
receiving similar visions, and who welcomed Vestapalk as his awaited ruler. The
dragon’s support turned the Greenscales from just another embattled kobold tribe
to a local power that’s busy securing territory between Winterhaven and Lake
Wintermist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiktag has great ambitions - he wants all others to fear him as his tribe fears
Vestapalk. I’m not sure he believes the dragon is a god, like his followers do,
but he does definitely think there’s something mystical about their partnership,
since Tiktag’s divination rituals have become amazingly accurate when done at
the dragon’s behest. The dragon, meanwhile, believes he might have been chosen
for greatness by the Elder Eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though they would be loathe to admit it, the kobold and the dragon have come to
see each other as friends. They’re almost always together and Vestapalk even
allows Tiktag to ride on his shoulders for safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get stats for both Vestapalk and his tiny friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tiktag&quot;&gt;Tiktag&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wyrmpriest is much more powerful than is typical, being a Level 6 Artillery
monster with 56 HP. As a kobold, he’s Small, has a Speed of 6, Low-Light Vision,
and the &lt;strong&gt;Shifty&lt;/strong&gt; ability that lets him shift as a minor action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiktag will always be found close to his dragon friend, and the &lt;strong&gt;Prophet of the
Elemental Eye&lt;/strong&gt; trait gives him 5e-style Advantage on saves when he’s within 10
squares of Vestapalk. He’ll fire &lt;strong&gt;Poison Orbs&lt;/strong&gt; that do poison damage from the
safety of his perch, and use his poison &lt;strong&gt;Dragon Breath&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 3) when
they happen to be close and bunched up. If an enemy moves adjacent to him he can
use &lt;strong&gt;Fierce Rebuke&lt;/strong&gt; once per encounter to attack their Will. The enemy is
pushed 3 squares as an effect and either immobilized on a hit or slowed on a
miss. When that power is spent, the priest needs to resort to his &lt;strong&gt;spear&lt;/strong&gt; to
discourage melee attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter he can use &lt;strong&gt;Incite Faith&lt;/strong&gt; to give every kobold ally within
10 squares 5 temporary HP and allow them to shift 1 square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vestapalk&quot;&gt;Vestapalk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main event is a Large green dragon, and a Level 13 Solo Skirmisher with 524
HP. Most of his abilities are similar to the green dragon described in the
Monster Vault, but he’s the first Adult example you’re likely to see if that’s
the only other monster book you have (the MV has Young and Elder variants). He
has a speed of 10 with Forest Walk, and a flight speed of 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a typical green dragon, Vestapalk can use &lt;strong&gt;Action Recovery&lt;/strong&gt; to shake off
the Dazed, Stunned, and Dominated conditions at the start of his turn, and the
poison in his veins works as a damaging aura when he’s bloodied. He can also use
an &lt;strong&gt;Instinctive Flyby&lt;/strong&gt; at his Initiative count +10, flying his speed with a +4
bonus to defend against opportunity attacks and making a bite or claw attack
along the way. This is a free action - if a condition prevents him from using
free actions, that condition ends instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dragon’s &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; inflicts ongoing poison damage and his &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack
lets him shift 2 squares on a hit. His &lt;strong&gt;breath weapon&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) deals
immediate and ongoing poison damage, halving both on a miss. He can use a
&lt;strong&gt;Luring Glare&lt;/strong&gt; as a minor action to slide a target 3 squares, and has the
standard &lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Breath&lt;/strong&gt; ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that is standard green dragon stuff. He also has two exclusive abilities:
&lt;strong&gt;Tail Sweep&lt;/strong&gt; is a reaction that lets him attack any enemy who ended his turn
next to him without moving, dealing decent physical damage and knocking them
prone on a hit. And instead of an in-turn flyby attack, he can &lt;strong&gt;Share The Mad
Visions&lt;/strong&gt; with every creature in a Close Burst 2, which deals psychic damage and
pushes targets a number of squares equal to their speed. This deals half damage
on a miss, and Vestapalk can shift his speed as an effect. This powerful ability
recharges when he’s bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sure is an odd pair. The level disparity means it’s a bit hard to fit them
both in an encounter. If you’re at the level where Tiktag would make a good
boss, Vestapalk is going to splat you. If you’re at a level where Vestapalk
makes a good boss fight, you’re going to splat Tiktag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would suggest either making them separate encounters at different times in the
PC’s career, or increasing Tiktag’s level. Note that Vestapalk would actually be
kind of reluctant to use Share the Mad Visions if the little kobold is around,
since that ability is not selective.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Threats to the Nentir Vale: Vampiric Mist</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-vampiric-mist.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vampiric Mists originally appeared back in AD&amp;amp;D 1e, in Dungeon Magazine 17. This
is their 4e debut, with lore appropriate to the Nentir Vale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient legends tell that the Witchlight Fens mark the spot where a demon lord
was slain at the dawn of time - the region became a swamp when its corpse fell
there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In slightly-less-ancient times, a lich whose name has been lost to history
established a lair in the Fens with the goal of finding the remains of this
demon lord and reanimating them as a super-powerful undead
creature. Accompanying the lich was a coven of nine vampire lords, its loyal
retainers. These vampires were tasked with hiding and guarding the lich’s soul
vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time after that, one of the lich’s enemies, a powerful hag, came to the
fens in search of its soul vessel. She had created a custom ritual to destroy
the vampires, and she enacted it there, but it didn’t have the desired
effect. Her magic succeeded at destroying the bodies of the vampires, but their
essence remained and coalesced to form a new, more dangerous
creature. The hag left without finding the artifact, which remains in the Fens
protected by its gaseous guardian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a deserted clearing in the Fens that contains a single slab of stone in
its middle. That is the territory of the monster known as the Crimson Deathmist,
who endlessly roams it looking for new victims. It prefers the blood of elves
and other fey, but it will kill anyone it can reach. It has been a very long
time since anyone who encountered it has lived to tell the tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stone slab conceals the entrance to a catacomb complex where the lich’s soul
vessel is hidden. The fate of the lich itself is unknown. Maybe it’s still in
the Fens somewhere, or maybe something peculiar happened to it to take it out of
the picture without destroying its vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all vampiric mists have such an epic origin. A more common and less powerful
variety appears when a vampire who is forced into mist form has its resting
place destroyed before it can get there. To avoid permanent destruction, the
vampire will sometimes shed its physical form by an act of will, becoming a
vampiric mist. This causes it to lost most of its intellect and memories, and to
become a creature of hunger and instinct. They’re still smart enough to team up
with other evil or predatory swamp dwellers like hags, vine horrors, and outcast
lizardfolk. There’s always the danger the mist will turn on these allies if they
have blood and victims become scarce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get several varieties of vampiric mist here, which I guess come from
different types of vampire, or vampires who met different ends. One of those is
the late-Paragon Crimson Deathmist, but others hover hungrily around the late
Heroic and early Paragon tiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of them have Darkvision, immunity to disease, 10 Resistance to necrotic and
poison damage, and 5 vulnerability to radiant damage. Their ground speed is 0,
but their flight speed is a 5 with an altitude limit of 2. That means they never
land, but also can’t fly beyond melee reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these creatures have the &lt;strong&gt;Mist Form&lt;/strong&gt; trait, which lets them move
through openings of any size and occupy the same space as other creatures. They
also count as &lt;strong&gt;Insubstantial&lt;/strong&gt;, taking half damage from everything but fire,
force, or radiant damage. Fire or radiant damage additionally makes them lose
this trait for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesser mists have an aura (1) named &lt;strong&gt;Siphoning Presence&lt;/strong&gt; that prevent enemies
inside from spending healing surges, and deal 5/tier necrotic damage to enemies
who end their turns inside. When the aura deals damage, the mist recovers 5
HP. Being inside the mist does count as being inside its aura. They are Medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vampiric-mist&quot;&gt;Vampiric Mist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our basic model is a Level 9 Skirmisher with 85 HP and all the standard traits
listed above. It can shift its speed as a move action using the &lt;strong&gt;Shifting
Mists&lt;/strong&gt; ability, which ensures it will never move normally. Its basic attack is
a contact &lt;strong&gt;Life Drain&lt;/strong&gt; that targets Fortitude, deals necrotic damage, and
makes the target vulnerable to necrotic damage for a turn. It can also spread a
&lt;strong&gt;Wave of Lethargy&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) that attacks a Close Burst 2, deals a bit of
psychic and necrotic damage, and slows for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thing is almost impossible to pin down. With multiple mists in the same
encounter, some can “prime” targets by hitting them with Life Drain to make them
take increased damage from a Wave of Lethargy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vampiric-mist-corruptor&quot;&gt;Vampiric Mist Corruptor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this is what you get from a more traditional D&amp;amp;D vampire who was capable
of using a dominating gaze and really leaned on this ability. Corruptors are
Level 11 Controllers with 100 HP and all standard traits described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the fight starts they’ll try to hit someone with their &lt;strong&gt;Corrupting
Gaze&lt;/strong&gt;, which dominates (save ends) on a hit and deals necrotic and psychic
damage as an aftereffect. This recharges whenever the creature doesn’t have a
dominated victim!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dominating a PC, it will attack the others with its &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals
necrotic damage and slides 2 squares on a hit. Perfect for dragging other PCs
closer to the dominated one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the mist is first bloodied, it will let loose a &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Howl&lt;/strong&gt; that hits
a Close Burst 5, pushes 3 squares on a hit and forbids targets from spending
healing surges (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t add more than one or two of these to an encounter group. It’s no fun for
anyone if the whole party ends up dominated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chillborn-vampiric-mist&quot;&gt;Chillborn Vampiric Mist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a cold-themed mist. It’s a Level 9 Soldier with 85 HP and all standard
traits described above. All of its attacks do cold and necrotic damage. There’s
a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; that slows for a turn and the &lt;strong&gt;Grasp of the Cold Grave&lt;/strong&gt; that
immobilizes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These mists lack marking capabilities, but their attacks are still very good at
making movement difficult for PCs. It could easily be reskinned into some other
frost-themed ghost without any changes to its stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crimson-deathmist&quot;&gt;Crimson Deathmist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legendary Crimson Deathmist is a Huge entity, and a Level 19 Elite Soldier
with 328 HP. It’s faster with a flight speed of 6 and an altitude limit of 3. It
is however slightly more vulnerable to radiant damage (10 instead of 5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This monster has all the standard traits, but its Siphoning Presence is renamed
to &lt;strong&gt;Impending Doom&lt;/strong&gt; and upgraded. I has a radius of 2 instead of 1, and
restores 10 HP to the mist instead of 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deathmist can pull enemies 4 squares closer with its &lt;strong&gt;Hypnotic Lure&lt;/strong&gt;
(at-will, minor action), and then &lt;strong&gt;Demand Obedience&lt;/strong&gt; from them. This is a
melee attack that can target two creatures at the same time. It deals psychic
and necrotic damage, with an additional 10 damage the next turn if the targets
attack anyone other than the Deathmist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Deathly Grasp&lt;/strong&gt; that deals necrotic and poison damage
and also slows for a turn. It can also release a &lt;strong&gt;Terror Wave&lt;/strong&gt; that deals
psychic damage in a Close Burst 2 and immobilizes for a turn. That last one
recharges when it’s bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impression&quot;&gt;Final Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mists’ mechanics are cool, but what really drew my attention was the story
about the lich. A lich whose name is unknown, who lived in ancestral times, who
was interested in undead demon lords, and who is no longer around? That could be
Vecna, whose deeds in this place let him ascend. And instead of a typical soul
vessel you’d find his Eye at the bottom of this catacomb dungeon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that doesn’t appeal, you’ll notice that any party capable of defeating the
Crimson Deathmist guarding the entrance is at about the right level to tackle
the Tomb of Horrors… You’d need to change that clearing a bit to include the
three entrances, but otherwise it’s as good a place to put it as any.&lt;/p&gt;
