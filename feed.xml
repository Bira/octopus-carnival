        <title>Let's Play Hell's Rebels!</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a Let’s Read of Hell’s Rebels way back when it was new, in 2017. I had
gotten the campaign’s first three volumes with alongside a huge pile of other
Pathfinder PDFs in one of Humble Bundle’s offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to publish articles about the first three of those books here, though
I kinda stalled out between volumes 2 and 3. I still want to “Let’s Read” the
rest one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post, and the series it starts, are about something a bit different. You
see, ever since I got those books I also had a desire to &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt; this campaign,
but I didn’t want to do so using Pathfinder 1e’s default system. No, I wanted,
and still want, to use the Dungeon Fantasy RPG for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually did it, too! This was during the thick of the pandemic here in
Brazil, so I ran it on Roll20 with a group of friends. We got through the first
two adventures, but I ended up stopping that campaign because the combined
workload became a bit too heavy for me. I had to convert everything, prepare
battle maps and tokens for Roll20, adjudicate setting developments in response
to PC actions, and do all of that on time for the next session in two weeks
while juggling all the other stress sources those interesting times produced for
me and my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still wanted to go through the whole thing, whether as a GM or as a player. As
a GM, I no longer had any confidence I could prepare everything I needed on
schedule. As a player, I had that peculiar problem where the only person I knew
who wanted to run that adventure in the exact way I wanted to play it was
me. Clearly, there was only one solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-this-thing-as-a-solo-campaign&quot;&gt;Running this thing as a solo campaign&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually decided to run Hell’s Rebels for myself as a solo campaign way back
at the beginning of 2023, but it took until the start of June for me to finally
find the inspiration I was lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This won’t be my first “solo” campaign: I ran through the first two Zeitgeist
adventures that way between 2015 and 2017, give or take a year. That attempt
lost steam due to the issues I’m about to discuss, but it was pretty fun while
it lasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solo campaign attempts don’t have much in common with others I’ve seen
online. Those games tend to be quite minimalistic, with a single protagonist run
by the solo player, a setting sketched in broad strokes, and some sort of
“divination engine” taking the place of the GM. There is no pre-defined plot at
all - it’s entirely decided by asking questions to the engine and interpreting
its answers. The protagonist might have a starting goal, but how hard that is to
reach and what happens on the way are determined randomly. Note-taking seems
pretty minimal, unless the player in question wants to post actual play reports
online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that approach and it is in
fact the one I would recommend to most people who want to do a solo game. All of
the solo game products out there support it, and it is excellent at replicating
the experience of being a player in a game and not knowing what will happen
next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also not the approach I’m going to use for myself. I guess I’m built
different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference between this game and one using the “best practice”
approach outlined above is that I have a pre-defined module I want to run: the
Hell’s Rebels Adventure Path. Not only do I want to play that, I’ve already read
the first four volumes quite closely. While I find it easy to “forget” this
stuff when I’m just a player, here I’m also the GM, which makes separating this
knowledge impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, I have this weird desire to run it in a way that mirrors a
standard party-based campaign with multiple players as closely as possible. I
want a &lt;em&gt;party&lt;/em&gt; of heroes, and I want to be both player and GM at the same
time. I want it to be GURPS, and I want to interact with the mechanical widgets
of that system because I find them fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, I don’t want to just keep a minimal set of notes. I’m not gonna
write things as a novel or anything, but I kinda want to see the game’s events
rendered as a reasonably comprehensive actual play report of the sort I see in
the [Dungeon Fantastic][1] blog. I’d do that even if I &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; intend to post
them publicly - it’s what I did for Zeitgeist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-im-doing-this&quot;&gt;How I’m doing this&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My strange preferences bring two big risks to this endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is the lack of an “information barrier” between player and
GM. This barrier and the dramatic tension it brings do not exist when player and
GM are the same person. The usual strategies for separating in-character
knowledge from out-of-character information do not work here, at least for
me. This gives me the strange simultaneous feeling that I’m “cheating” (as a
player) and “going too easy on the PCs” (as a GM). This is obviously an obstacle
to fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue is with preparing maps and tokens. Sure, this would be much
easier on me if I ran everything in the theater of the mind, but I like moving
figures around on a battle map. The problem on my earlier attempts was that I
would usually leave the &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt; of those battle maps to the very last second,
when I’d be in a rush to get on with the action. This also means I never took
the necessary time to familiarize myself with the software I was using. So I’d
stall, and procrastinate, and take two months to finish something that could
have been done in a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve both of these issues, I’m going to make a resolution to never wear the
GM and player hats at the same time. The GM hat is for preparation. The player
hat is for “actual play”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gm-hat&quot;&gt;The GM Hat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During preparation, I’m going to consider myself a mix of GM and designer and
I’m going to lean on my newly-discovered feelings of Miniature Envy. You see, a
lot of the online friends I’ve made in the past year and a half are very much
into tabletop wargaming. They have extensive miniature collections and extremely
well-organized workspaces for assembling and painting them. They often post the
results of their work online and it always looks awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have neither the space, skill, nor the budget to do the same thing, but I
&lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; look at the process of building battle maps and actor tokens in GCS,
TokenTool and Foundry with the same sort of perspective. Learning how to use the
software and actually building the things, then, becomes a hobby in itself. And
there’s no time or schedule pressure, so there’s no problem if I take a bit
longer in this part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will also be when I actually convert enemy stats, tests, and treasure from
the adventure’s original Pathfinder 1e to GURPS Dungeon Fantasy. I’ll try to
make them useful to others who want to try running the adventure in a more
traditional manner, but I won’t bother converting rules material for those paths
my PCs never take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also perform some significant “condensation” in the campaign. Like all
Pathfinder adventure paths, Hell’s Rebels includes a lot of filler fights
placed to give your PCs enough XP for them to hit the expected character levels
at the right times. It also features lots of elements that get added only on
later books but which could be relevant from the start. Neither of these things
are necessary in a Dungeon Fantasy campaign where the PCs already start out
powerful and advance in a completely different manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I have a large enough chunk of unplayed material, I’m going to take
off my GM hat and become a player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-player-hat&quot;&gt;The Player Hat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve the information barrier issue, I’m going to just learn to stop worrying
and love the cheese. When I’m wearing my player hat, it will be like I’m playing
a computer game with a walkthrough open. Sure, I might know what’s coming, and I
might even have a party custom-tailored to overcome those challenges, but the
&lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; of overcoming those challenges can still be quite fun. It can even
still be surprising, depending on what the dice tell me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helps that this is the campaign whose main goal is punching fantasy
Nazis. Even if I know what’s coming, the actual process of going through it can
still be fun. Let us make awesome heroes tailored to the challenge and
completely stomp those fascist fuckers into the fucking ground! Let’s kick their
asses all the way to the Hell they came from! I want catharsis, dangit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also try to pay special attention to my characters’ disadvantages and
other traits, and obey the dictates of those self-control rolls. And when some
kind of question appears during the “actual play” part, I’m going to use
the Mythic GM Emulator to answer it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-in-this-for-you&quot;&gt;What’s in this for you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort is going to generate a lot of material for this blog! I expect
readers will get some use out of my premade PCs, and out of the enemy stat
blocks I generate. Everything from those stats to the “actual play” reports and
design commentary is going to be published here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Abolethic Sovereignity Encounters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The table of standard monsters that make up the AbSov’s roster includes pretty
much every heroic-tier aberrant creature, from Fell Taints (MM2) to the weaker
varieties of Mooncalf (Threats to the Nentir Vale). It also includes Heroic-Tier
versions of iconic aberrants usually found in Paragon, and non-aberrant
creatures and humanoids that can act as covert agents or as the basis for
mutated monstrosities with the Plaguechanged Monster theme described here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll take a look at the new monsters, NPCs, and at the template here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aboleth-opener&quot;&gt;Aboleth Opener&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an aboleth specializing in brute-force psychic intrusion, “opening the
mind” of its victims using mental attacks and then dominating them for transport
to the underground base, where they will become test subjects. It’s a Large
Aberrant Magical Beast and a Level 7 Controller with 82 HP and the Aquatic
keyword. It has darkvision, a ground speed of 5, and a swim speed of 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Opener projects an &lt;strong&gt;Eroding Mucus Haze&lt;/strong&gt;, an aura (5) that is difficult
terrain for enemies and deals 5 psychic damage to any dazed enemy that starts
their turn inside. It can fight in melee with its &lt;strong&gt;Flaying Tentacles&lt;/strong&gt;, which
do immediate and ongoing damage, but it prefers to stick to mental attacks if
possible in order to avoid damaging the goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature’s title comes from its &lt;strong&gt;Mental Lance&lt;/strong&gt; ranged attack, which deals
psychic damage and dazes for a turn. It can then target dazed targets with
&lt;strong&gt;Enslaved Open Mind&lt;/strong&gt;, a minor action power that dominates the target (save
ends). This recharges whenever the Opener has no dominated victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aboleth-remnant&quot;&gt;Aboleth Remnant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even the aboleths themselves are immune to Spellplague corruption. Exposure
tends to turn them into these Remnants, whose body constantly spawns and sheds
tentacles and other limbs, and whose mind is in tatters. Remnants can fly,
unlike typical aboleths. They’re treated like the rest of the base’s “trash”,
and sent up the chasm to harass Neverwinter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These wretches are Large Aberrant Magical Beasts and Level 5 Brutes with 78 HP
and the Aquatic keyword. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 5, a flight
speed of 7 (hover) and a swim speed of 10. They project an aura (2) of
&lt;strong&gt;Maddening Mucus&lt;/strong&gt;, which acts as difficult terrain for enemies and makes them
grant combat advantage while inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their attacks are a Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;Telescoping Tentacle&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and knocks
prone on a hit, and a &lt;strong&gt;Tentacle Flurry&lt;/strong&gt; that targets enemies in a Close Burst
2, damaging and dazing them on a hit (save ends). A miss here deals half
damage. This recharges when the creature is first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grell-strangler&quot;&gt;Grell Strangler&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This less-venomous variety of Grell is fond of strangling its victims. It’s a
Medium Aberrant Magical Beast with the Blind keyword. It has Blindsight 12, a
ground speed of 1, and a flight speed of 6 (hover).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its basic attack is a Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;Tentacle Lash&lt;/strong&gt; that deals physical damage and
forces the target to grant combat advantage for a turn. That last one seems to
be a poison effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the strangler isn’t grabbing anyone at the moment, it can use &lt;strong&gt;Grasping
Tentacles&lt;/strong&gt; to remedy the situation. This Reach 2 attack does a bit of physical
damage and grabs the target (escape DC 16). The grell can immediately shift 1
square and pull the victim up to 2 squares, and while the grab persists the
victim takes 5 ongoing damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the strangler grabs someone, it will use &lt;strong&gt;Haul Away&lt;/strong&gt; to do exactly
that. This move action lets it shift half its speed and drag a victim along with
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are great for separating the party and messing up their
formations. Defenders and controllers should focus on locking them down to
prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nothic-plagegazer&quot;&gt;Nothic Plagegazer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This monster is entirely made by the chaotic magic of the Spellplague
pocket. Its gaze can inflict a debilitating spell sickness on its victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plaguegazers are Medium Aberrant Humanoids and Level 6 Artillery with 60
HP. They have a speed of 6, darkvision, and truesight 10. They exude an &lt;strong&gt;Oozing
Plague&lt;/strong&gt; from their skin that causes any creature that ends their turn adjacent
to the nothic to take ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nothic prefers to keep away from enemies and attack them with its
&lt;strong&gt;Sickening Gaze&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals necrotic damage, ongoing 5 poison damage, and
slows (save ends both). After the first failed save, the Slowed condition
worsens to Immobilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also use an area attack named &lt;strong&gt;Spread the Infection&lt;/strong&gt;. This targets a
creature taking ongoing poison damage, and affects an Area Burst 1 centered on
them. It deals necrotic damage and inflicts ongoing 10 poison damage (save ends)
on those it hits. On a miss, it still inflicts half its immediate and ongoing
damage. It recharges when the nothic is bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it has no other choices, it will use its &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; in melee. They have no
riders, but Oozing Plague will probably be in effect here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nothic-mindwarp&quot;&gt;Nothic Mindwarp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another nothic produced by the plague pocket. It’s more insane than usual, and
likes to caper and cackle about as it drives others mad with its gaze. It’s a
Level 3 Lurker with 42 HP and a Speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mindwarp will try to affect someone with its &lt;strong&gt;Warping Gaze&lt;/strong&gt;, a ranged
attack that deals psychic damage and forces the target to grant CA (save
ends). While the target is affected by this condition, the nothic becomes
invisible to everyone but the target, and its basic &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack does 1d6
extra damage. On a miss, the nothic still has partial concealment for a
turn. The power recharges when the victim saves against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the tactic here is to use Warping Gaze on someone, and then try to attack
&lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt; with enhanced claw attacks, repeating the procedure when the
gaze’s victim saves against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the nothic gets surrounded, it can use its &lt;strong&gt;Forbidding Glare&lt;/strong&gt; encounter
power to attack enemies in a Close Burst 2, dealing psychic damage and pushing
them 2 squares on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plaguechanged-monster-theme&quot;&gt;Plaguechanged Monster Theme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A monster &lt;em&gt;theme&lt;/em&gt; modifies a monster in a less drastic way than a monster
&lt;em&gt;template&lt;/em&gt;. Templates turn a regular into an elite or an elite into a
solo. Themes add a couple of flavorful powers without changing the monster’s
level or “quality”. They’re a great way to really tie a dungeon together, even
if the base creatures are very disparate otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plaguechanged monsters are affected by the Spellplague. They show the scars or
mutations associated with it, and possess magic abilities that use its
characteristic blue flames and corruptive effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was mistaken before - plaguechanged monsters do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; gain the ability to
sense spellscarred PCs, nor do they suffer defense penalties against these
PCs. To create one, you just add one attack and one utility power to the base
creature from the sets provided here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attack powers include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Fire Burst&lt;/strong&gt;: Encounter, triggers when first bloodied. Close burst 2
vs. Reflex, deals fire and force damage, pushes 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inferno Step&lt;/strong&gt;: Teleport 5 squares and attack a Close Burst 1 on
arrival. This deals fire damage and knocks prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scouring Lash&lt;/strong&gt;: At-will reach 2 melee attack, deals fire and force damage
and slides 1 square on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unraveling Touch&lt;/strong&gt; Encounter reach 1 melee attack, deals necrotic damage and
dazes (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack and damage from all of these are expressed in terms of the base
creature’s level, so they can be applied to any monster from any book - even
minions, as the DMG2 has rules for applying themes to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utility powers include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burning Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; Encounter, minor action. Invisible or otherwise hidden
enemies within 5 squares of the creature glow with blue flame, losing the
benefits from cover and concealment and granting combat advantage until the
end of the creature’s next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devourer of Flame&lt;/strong&gt;: Encounter, triggers in reaction to taking fire
damage. The creature gains temporary HP equal to half the fire damage, and a
+4 bonus do damage rolls until the end of its next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wings of Blue Fire&lt;/strong&gt;: Encounter, move action. The creature flies its speed,
and anyone making opportunity attacks against it during this movement takes
fire damage equal to the creature’s level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rohini-the-prophet-of-helms-hold&quot;&gt;Rohini, The Prophet of Helm’s Hold&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have a surprise NPC big-shot belonging to the AbSov faction. Rohini is
the person in charge of Helm’s Hold, which as we saw before has been converted
into a hospital for Spellplague victims and has a Realms-wide good reputation
for its humanitarian efforts. This is where we learn that the Hold is a front
for the Abolethic Sovereignity, and Rohini is their agent. There was already
some mention of it in the New Neverwinter section, but this one gives us the
full details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prophet of Helm’s Hold presents herself as an attractive and charismatic
female human, but she’s something fair weirder. Not long ago, she was a succubus
summoned by the Ashmadai and tasked with infiltrating the spellscarred treatment
center in Neverwinter’s House of Knowledge. There, a priest corrupted by the
Sovereignity exposed her to an artifact named the Hex Locus, a solidified chunk
of Spellplague magic. This warped the devil and infused her with the same
essence that turns humans into foulspawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohini’s main mission is to safeguard the Locus, which she moved to Helm’s
Hold. Her secondary goal is to collect new Choir candidates from among the
Hold’s patients and send them to the underground base. She is called the Prophet
because she makes statements about future events that tend to come true (due to
AbSov meddling). Her healing blessings are entirely fake, and make patients feel
good just as their condition steadily worsens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohini has stats very similar to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2019/12/15/succubus.html&quot;&gt;standard succubus&lt;/a&gt;, making her a Level 9
Controller. There are some important differences, though. She’s Aberrant instead
of Immortal. Her basic Corrupting Touch is upgraded to a &lt;strong&gt;Maddening Touch&lt;/strong&gt;
that does psychic damage and slides 2 squares. Her Charming Kiss turns into a
&lt;strong&gt;Soul-Wrenching Kiss&lt;/strong&gt; that places more restrictions upon the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As before, the victim of the kiss is unable to attack the succubus, but they
also can’t willingly move away from her, closing the main loophole in the basic
succubus’ power. They also take 10 ongoing fire and psychic damage while under
the effect of the kiss. All of this is a (save ends) package, and it also ends
when Rohini attacks the victim or uses the kiss on someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her Loyal Consort power is upgraded to &lt;strong&gt;Mind-Warped Bodyguard&lt;/strong&gt;. Now it works
as long as the victim of the Kiss is within 5 squares of Rohini, and lets them
teleport to switch places before redirecting attacks to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chartilifax&quot;&gt;Chartilifax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This complicated name belongs to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2020/01/16/green-dragon.html&quot;&gt;young green dragon&lt;/a&gt; who used to inhabit
the Neverwinter Wood, and which Rohini managed to seduce and
subvert. Experiments performed by the AbSov’s foulspawn sorcerers have given him
the ability to transform into a Medium humanoid like his master, and the
Devourer of Flame power from the Plaguechanged theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chartilifax spends most of his days in the shape of a green-skinned elf in the
basements under Helm’s Hold, performing menial tasks. He’s also pretty close to
Rohini’s seat of power, so he’s gonna be there as a nasty surprise when the PCs
manage to corner her.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Abolethic Sovereignity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, one of the things the Spellplague did a century ago was to
bring parts of the world of Abeir into Toril, and vice-versa. These transplanted
chunks of geography also brought whoever happened to be living on them. And one
of these whoevers was the Abolethic Sovereignity, a kingdom ruled by these
aberrant creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after arriving, the Sovereignity built a flying citadel named Xxiphu to
act as their headquarters. Interested in studying the phenomenon that isekaied
them, the aboleths started searching for pockets of the chaotic magic that makes
up the Spellplague and sending in research teams to investigate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the pockets they found was in the Underdark beneath Neverwinter. A branch
of the Sovereignity built a permanent base around it and have been studying it
for the past few decades, occasionally kidnapping people from the surface to
serve as test subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the eruption happened, it opened a chasm on the surface that went all the
way down to the aboleth base, potentially exposing it to curious delvers from
the surface. Moving the base was not an option, so they instead fortified it and
began sending the results of their early experiments up the chasm as a way to
discourage explorers. This worked for a long time, since the city was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Neverember arrived and began rebuilding, the aboleths felt threatened and
began taking more active steps to divert the lord’s attention elsewhere and to
infiltrate his organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a century of research the aboleths have a pretty good handle on the
properties of the Spellplague, and they have a planned use for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, they know where Maegera is. Their entry in the book off-handedly
remarks that it was a brief awakening of the primordial that caused that
city-destroying eruption. The AbSov’s ultimate plan is to expose the primordial
to the Spellplague, using the techniques they developed to then dominate her
mind or control her in some other fashion. With a genuine primordial under their
command, the Sovereignity has a real shot at taking over the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, they’re using that expertise on a steady stream of victims
brought from the surface by their agents. These unfortunates are exposed to the
Spellplague in a controlled manner. Those who fail to display the proper
strength of mind and soul after initial exposure to the Plague become the
monsters regularly released upon the surface. Those who pass this test are then
subject to a very specific series of tortures and procedures that turn them into
near-mindless members of the Choir that sings the Symphony of Madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Symphony can channel the chaotic energies of the Spellplague in ways that
the aboleths can control, and it’s what they use to mutate their kidnapped
victims. They also use it to broadcast nightmares all over the region, which
afflict its more psychically sensitive individuals. The stronger it gets the
more people are affected. This could eventually be the tool they use to tame
Maegera, or could lead to the development of that tool depending on the GM’s
designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;player-tie-ins&quot;&gt;Player Tie-Ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nightmares mentioned in the descriptions of Oghma’s Faithful and the
Spellscarred Harbinger come from the Symphony of Madness. The latter in
particular has very strong thematic ties to the AbSov - their starting hook
sends the PC right into their clutches, as we’ll see soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the GM decides to make the AbSov a major antagonist in the campaign, then the
Symphony’s nightmares will likely begin affecting more and more people. Its
effects are not set in stone, but the book gives various suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They might make victims irritable and violent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They might drain healing surges after a long rest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They might impost long-lasting penalties from lack of sleep or psychological
trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They might provide hints about where to find their source.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepping up the frequency or severity of these effects over the course of the
campaign will provide a very strong incentive for PCs to find the source of
these dreams and shut it down, leading to a big confrontation against the AbSov
in their home base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way the PCs might protect themselves from the nightmares is to buy these
creepy little dolls sold by Helm’s Hold. If you place one of these Dreamthief
Dolls under your pillow at night, you won’t experience the nightmares. Rumor has
it that the dolls send the nightmares they catch to the Hold’s patients, but
Rohini, who runs the hospice at the Hold, says they’re just imbued with minor
protective blessings (she’s lying; the rumors are true).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already know the AbSov is busily infiltrating New Neverwinter. Here we also
learn that they sort of disdain the Ashmadai, because all of the cult’s attempts
to infiltrate them have only fed them more converts (including Rohini). They are
however more circumspect when dealing with the Thayans or the Netherese, because
they fear the powerful magic those factions might be able to bring to bear if
they call on their far-away epic bosses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a comparatively huge entry with an extensive encounters section, as
we’ll see in the next post. This leads me to think the Aboleths are intended to
be one of the campaign’s top antagonists. A campaign where you start opposing
(or even working for) New Neverwinter and uncover the aboleth conspiracy seems
to be an easy one to make with the book’s default setup.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: New Neverwinter Encounters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;New Neverwinter’s hired goons can be represented by a variety of statblocks for
characters or usually-playable ancestries extracted from the Monster Manual 2,
Monster Vault, and Threats to the Nentir Vale. There’s a table here with entries
ranging from level 1 to level 8. It includes a Doppelganger Sneak, every stat
block from the [River Rats][1] entry in Threats plus a smattering of humans,
gnomes, half-elves and dragonborn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also get detailed writeups for Neverember himself and for Soman Galt, and
some information on General Sabine, the faction’s third big shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dagult-neverember&quot;&gt;Dagult Neverember&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As written, Neverember is a somewhat complex villain by D&amp;amp;D standards. He’s
ruthless, greedy, arrogant and imperialistic, but he is not evil-aligned. His
preferred way of lining his own pockets also tends to be beneficial to his trade
partners, and he is sincere in his desire to improve the lives of his subjects
even if it’s only so they’ll crown him king. He also behaves like a typical
mercantilist aristocrat, which includes a dose of sexism. He treats “intelligent
male acquaintances” with respect but “flirts outrageously” with “beautiful
female guests”. I strongly suggests removing these traits from his personality
if you want him to come off as sympathetic to your players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs can stomach his horrible personality, he might end up allied with
them against a greater threat, even if only because that greater threat would be
worse for the region than him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he dies, it will cause a lot of chaos in the city, because like it or not
he’s one of the region’s current stabilizing forces. The Thayans, Netherese, and
the rebels would immediately feel emboldened by the chaos, and the rebels in
particular will immediately turn on anyone who tries to take leadership of the
city for themselves (because &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; want it). If no one else manages to take
over, General Sabine will do it and turn the city into a brutal militarized
police state. So I guess the PCs should make sure the region is set up to remain
stable after his demise before facing the guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neverember is a Level 7 Soldier with 84 HP. Yes, he’s a regular, which means he
will have &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of bodyguards with him. He’s armed with a &lt;strong&gt;Longsword&lt;/strong&gt; whose
basic attacks inflict a -2 penalty to hit for a turn, and if an adjacent enemy
shifts or targets someone other than him with an attack, he can use &lt;strong&gt;Lord’s
Rebuke&lt;/strong&gt; to make a free basic attack against them. He can also &lt;strong&gt;Taunt&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 4+), an attack vs. Will that targets one enemy and on a hit pulls them
4 squares and makes them grant combat advantage for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-sabine&quot;&gt;General Sabine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General Sabine doesn’t get a section of her own, but I’m collecting and
repeating the scattered information we get about her here. She’s the commander
of the mercenary company Lord Neverember hired to act as his army and police
force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason he’s using mercenaries is because using his house troops from
Waterdeep would make the whole situation look too much like an invasion and
occupation by a foreign power. Sabine, however, is perfectly able and willing to
command her army like the foreign invasion and occupation force it is. There’s
not to much nuance to her character - she’s an uncomplicated brutal
authoritarian. She uses the stats for the Human Cavalier from the MM2, making
her a Level 7 Soldier (Leader).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine there are lots of complaints about the police brutality inflicted on
the citizenry of Neverwinter by the mercenaries, though I guess Neverember
manages to keep them at just below the level where he’d care. If Neverember dies
suddenly, General Sabine is the most likely character to replace him in the
internal power struggle that will follow, and she will turn the city into a
violent police state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mordai Vell, one of the leaders of the Ashmadai, is trying to recruit Sabine for
the cult. As of the campaign’s start, he hasn’t succeeded yet - whether he will
or not depends on the wishes of the GM and the events that happen in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;soman-galt&quot;&gt;Soman Galt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acting mayor of Neverwinter gained his position because of his previous
career as a government official. He’s more than a bit scatterbrained but is
capable of taking his job seriously and performing it competently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neverember thinks of Galt as a useful puppet, and he’s right. However, he’s
&lt;em&gt;someone else’s&lt;/em&gt; puppet. Rohini, the Prophet of Helm’s Hold, got a hold of the
dwarf and turned him into an asset of the Abolethic Sovereignity quite some time
ago. As the campaign starts, Galt is under an incredible number of
aboleth-crafted post-hypnotic suggestions, and regularly visits Helm’s Hold to
receive more. This has him looking less and less healthy as time goes by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means the aboleths are effectively in control of the city’s civil and
social policies, and know everything that happens on it. They know which spots
on the city wall are less defended, and send their monsters there. They’re going
to have an incredible edge when they decide to really invade the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galt &lt;em&gt;doesn’t actually know&lt;/em&gt; any of this, and would probably go insane from
trauma and guilt if he learned it. In emergencies, one of the aboleths below can
assume direct control of him, switching his alignment from Unaligned to Chaotic
Evil and giving him access to extra powers. Once he becomes bloodied, that
control becomes stronger and he begins moving as if he was having a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galt is a Level 6 Controller with 74 HP. His typical dwarven speed of 5
increases to 7 when he’s bloodied. Being bloodied also activates his aura (5) of
&lt;strong&gt;Dissonant Gibberish&lt;/strong&gt;, which inflicts Vulnerable 5 Psychic and a -2 penalty to
saves on all enemies inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galt’s basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Whipping Warhammer&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and slides the
target 1 square. He can &lt;strong&gt;Transmute the Unwilling&lt;/strong&gt; as a ranged attack, dealing
psychic damage and slowing (save ends). Even on a miss this still slows for a
turn. Once per encounter he can &lt;strong&gt;Weave Nightmares&lt;/strong&gt; in a Close Burst 2,
targeting all enemies, dealing heavy psychic damage and dazing (save ends). Also
once per encounter he can &lt;strong&gt;Twist Space&lt;/strong&gt; to teleport 3 squares. If he chooses
to appear in an enemy’s space with this, they swap positions and the enemy
grants combat advantage for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Galt is our most pleasant surprise here, in terms of both his lore and
his mechanics. As for the other two, Sabine is more dangerous than Dagult if you
give her a mount and fix the damage on her MM2 stat block. I think this makes
sense, both in-setting and narratively. She’s kind of his Dragon, in TVTropes
parlance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: New Neverwinter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, Lord Dagult Neverember of Waterdeep has recently arrived in
Neverwinter at the head of a mercenary force with the intent of rebuilding the
city and re-establishing order and trade. He claims descent from one of Nasher
Alagondar’s bastard sons, saying this gives him the right to take over the
city. Alagondar was the ruler of Neverwinter at the time depicted in the
computer games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“New Neverwinter” is a concept Neverember’s propaganda machine came up with to
stir nationalistic sentiment among the populace and get them on-side. This, and
the practical results of his rebuilding efforts, have worked on the majority of
the city’s residents, but some of them consider the idea of a “new Neverwinter”
to be an insult to the city’s memory. Chief among these dissenters are the Sons
of Alagondar, militant rebels who oppose Neverember and have been clashing often
with his forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of what we’ve seen so far points to Neverember being a villainous
character, whose claim is fake and whose rule would be selfish and
oppressive. But there’s a text box here that reminds us that not even this is
set in stone. Lord Neverember’s role in a specific campaign is entirely up to
the GM. His claim might be true or false, his intentions might be altruistic or
selfish, and his rule could end up being good or bad for the region, and all of
these “switches” are independent from each other. Also independent from all of
this is the attitude of the PCs towards him - you still have a meaty campaign
whether they want to support or topple the lord, and there are plenty of other
things to occupy them if they’re indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neverember’s main goal is of course to &lt;strong&gt;Claim the Throne&lt;/strong&gt;. He is effectively
in charge of that portion of the city his faction controls, but running the city
and wearing its crown are very different things. Neverember’s current plan is to
make the people love him. He’s going to improve their lives so much that they’ll
beg him to become their lord, claim or no claim. Mwa-ha-ha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Dagult will still have a much easier time of it if he can &lt;strong&gt;Prove his
Disputed Heritage&lt;/strong&gt;. He knows his word is not enough to prove his claim, so he’s
been hiring scholars and explorers to look for documents that support it among
the city’s ruined archives and libraries. He’s also not above hiring those same
scholars to &lt;em&gt;fabricate&lt;/em&gt; such documents, and has burned more than one book that
had a less-than-helpful stance on his ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While seeking the crown, Neverember still has to actually &lt;strong&gt;Run the City&lt;/strong&gt;, to
&lt;strong&gt;Maintain His Position&lt;/strong&gt; as the Open Lord of Waterdeep, and he also never loses
sight of the whole reason he’s doing all of this, which is to &lt;strong&gt;Make Hard
Coin&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to juggle all of this, he delegates heavily. General Sabine,
who commands the mercenary army, is in charge of policing and defending the
territory he controls in the city. He appointed a dwarf named Soman Galt to act
as mayor and oversee tax collection, grants of property, and other paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the same reason, he loves to &lt;strong&gt;Hire Sellswords&lt;/strong&gt; to care care of problems
that require more discreet solutions. This includes looking for proof of his
claims and spying on the opposition as mentioned above, but it also includes
&lt;strong&gt;Finding Gauntlgrym&lt;/strong&gt; because having that as a feather on his cap would
increase his chances of being declared king by popular acclaim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;player-character-tie-ins&quot;&gt;Player Character Tie-Ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PC with the Neverwinter Noble background is Dagult’s greatest nightmare:
someone with a stronger claim to the throne of the city. He will either try to
deal with the obstacle by sending mercenaries to spy on or assassinate the
character, or by trying to publicly discredit them once the discreet approach
becomes impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Harper Agent was also sent here to oppose Neverember, but as the campaign
starts they’ve just realized nothing is as it seems. Are they proceeding with
their original mission, or deviating from it now that the Harpers’ original
intel proved to be woefully incomplete?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs with the Oghma’s Faithful theme would be eager to take part in any genuine
fact-finding expedition about Dagult’s lineage (or that of his
rivals!). However, their devotion is to the truth rather than to any mortal
lord, and the truth they find can end up drawing the ire of either Dagult
himself or his enemies, depending on whether it contradicts or supports his
claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on his exact moral disposition in the campaign, Neverember could be
either a potential sponsor or a rival to the Heir of Delzoun in the search for
Gauntlgrym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs without direct connections to this storyline might still find New
Neverwinter a ready source of miscellaneous mercenary jobs when they need some
extra cash and XP. In addition to being the hired swords for the above plots,
they could also bolster the faction’s efforts to evict the orcish army that has
taken part of the city ruins, or get hired to investigate the numerous
mysterious events in town that point to the other major factions, like
spellplagued monster attacks or mysterious disappearances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;faction-relationships&quot;&gt;Faction Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Neverwinter has no idea the &lt;strong&gt;Abolethic Sovereignity&lt;/strong&gt; is behind those
monster attacks. They’re causing these to keep the surfacers distracted while
they carry on their experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Ashmadai&lt;/strong&gt; managed to secure a tenuous alliance of sorts with New
Neverwinter. Dagult doesn’t know who they are beyond “a shady but influential
cult”. He uses them as an occasional source of deniable muscle, and they’re hard
at work subverting and corrupting his underlings with the goal of eventually
inducting the man himself among their ranks. Their leader, Mordai Veil, is
currently attempting to seduce General Sabine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was received a few reports of &lt;strong&gt;Thayans&lt;/strong&gt; in the region, and has tasked
General Sabine with finding out more. She has yet to deliver her first report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dagult is completely ignorant of &lt;strong&gt;Netherese&lt;/strong&gt; operations in the region and has
unwittingly hired Shadovar agents as assassins before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you decide to make the lord himself something other than a villainous
asshole, there are a lot of events in motion that could lead him and his faction
in that direction. They’re heavily infiltrated by both diabolists and abolethic
agents! PCs seeking to support or co-opt New Neverwinter are going to have a
harder job ahead of them than those who try to destroy it. They’re also in the
dark about the Thayans and Netherese as the campaign starts, and might be
blindsided by either of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still think Dagult and friends work better as villains, either by themselves
or as an eventual tool of someone worse. Making them neutral or sympathetic
would however be a good way to take New Neverwinter out of consideration if the
party is not interested in tangling with it, making it a part of the background
noise.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Factions and Foes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This chapter starts the GM-focused part of the book. The factions presented here
are the “other half” of all the plots hinted at in the character themes -
they’re what the themes are hooking into. This chapter will contain a lot of
information players won’t know at the start of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are five major factions operating in the Neverwinter region during this
campaign:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Neverwinter&lt;/strong&gt;: Dagult Neverember and his mercenary army, who want to
become the legitimate rulers of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abolethic Sovereignity&lt;/strong&gt;: A sect from this aberrant empire is experimenting
with a pocket of the Spellplague beneath the city with the eventual goal of
using it to control the sleeping primordial Maegera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A cult of Asmodeus worshipers, also known as &lt;strong&gt;Ashmadai&lt;/strong&gt;, is plotting to take
over the region for themselves but is in for a whole bunch of nasty surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Thayans&lt;/strong&gt; want to create an undead army and possibly complete their
genocidal plans from thirty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Netherese&lt;/strong&gt; want to repair the flying island of Xinlenal and use it as
the center of their new empire.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from these, there are many other smaller factions centered around either
the city of Neverwinter, like the rebel remnants, or around the Neverwinter
Wood, like the Uthgardt or the angry eladrin of Ilyianbruen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each major faction gets their own section consisting of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A general overview of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A detailed explanation of their goals. This includes text boxes with Theme
Tie-Ins that could lead the faction to interact with the PCs or
vice-versa. Some are obvious, others less so.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A summary of their relationship to other major factions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A discussion of what encounters against them look like, complete with
statistics for their important figures and any new monsters that might make up
their rank-and-file.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the introduction says, everybody’s levels are calibrated to fit in a
Heroic-tier campaign, and none of the plots and goals detailed here are set in
stone. Some of the faction descriptions include text boxes musing about
alternate setups, or what happens if the faction’s plots are seriously derailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minor factions get less space for themselves, but they still get some and
we’ll be looking at all of them in the order they appear on the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each major faction is going to be split into two posts here. The first will look
at their general description, goals, relationships, PC tie-ins and my
impressions of them. The second will deal with the Encounters section of their
writeup, which tends to be pretty long and often includes new monster stat
blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wealth in D&amp;D and Dungeon Fantasy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve done pretty often these past few years is converting D&amp;amp;D and
Pathfinder adventures for use with Dungeon Fantasy (either version). These
conversions didn’t have nowhere near the level of rigor of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/&quot;&gt;Dragon’s
Dogma&lt;/a&gt; adaptation, but that larger project did give me a solid grounding on
the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Converting from one tabletop system to the other is fairly easy, for the most
part, but there are some aspects of it that I found harder to do, especially on
the fly. One of these is converting wealth between the two systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I’ll be comparing the Dungeon Fantasy RPG and Pathfinder 1st
Edition and trying to come up with a way to convert monetary amounts from the
latter to the former. I chose the DFRPG because I use its monetary system in my
games, and I chose Pathfinder 1e because I want to convert Hell’s
Rebels. Pathfinder 1e, of course, shares most of its base assumptions with D&amp;amp;D
3.5, the system from which it is derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-money-looks-like&quot;&gt;What Money Looks Like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dungeon Fantasy purposefully makes its coins have the exact same dimensions as
those of D&amp;amp;D, and therefore Pathfinder. They both use chunky standardized coins
that weight 1/50th of a pound (around 10 grams). These come in copper, silver,
gold, and a few other exotic materials that we don’t need to look at right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dimensions are apparently universal standards, and their value comes from
their precious metal content. If you find a chest of thousand-year-old gold
coins in an ancient dungeon, you can carry them back to town and spend them on
the market right away. Finding “non-standard” coins is usually a rare special
case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, though their physical dimensions are identical, their values seem
to be derived from completely different assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-money-buys&quot;&gt;What Money Buys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all variants of GURPS, Dungeon Fantasy expresses its prices and values in
“GURPS dollars”, or “$”. The exact value of this unit of currency varies with
the setting. Here, $1 is the worth of a copper piece. Silver pieces are worth 20
copper pieces each ($20). Gold pieces are worth 20 silver pieces each
($400). This means GURPS is effectively on a copper standard. The vast majority
of Dungeon Fantasy characters gets $1000 to buy their starting gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Pathfinder we have the classic decimal setup where 1gp == 10sp == 100cp. The
most common coin is the gold piece, and nearly everything in the core book’s
gear chapter has its price expressed in gp. So here we’re on a &lt;em&gt;gold&lt;/em&gt;
standard. Starting money is determined by a random roll that varies per
class. Fighter-types start with an average of 175gp, others start with less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, this starting money is meant to let you buy your main weapon,
perhaps a backup or shield, a suit of armor, and the miscellaneous sundries that
make up your typical adventurer’s kit: a pouch or pack, some camping supplies
and rations, and maybe some tools like the thief’s lockpick set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there on out, things start to diverge quite sharply, and the way I see it
it’s mainly the fault of Pathfinder’s Wealth By Level table. It subjects PCs to
the tyranny of inflation. This plus the difference in base value means that
while a haul of a thousand gold pieces is a fantastic fortune for even veteran
Dungeon Fantasy delvers, it starts out at “pretty nice” for low-level Pathfinder
adventurers and quickly becomes “pocket change” for high-level ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-whats-our-exchange-rate&quot;&gt;So What’s Our Exchange Rate?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can start with the guidelines presented in the Exploits book: an adventure
should pay at least enough for the party to recoup their expenses with
consumables, power item recharge, and the cost of staying in town during
downtime. It’s perfectly OK for it to pay more than that, even &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more than
that, because it’s relatively easy to get rid of “excess” money by giving them
opportunities to spend it. Maybe a weird old man has a treasure map to sell, or
a mystical artifact or something. Magic items don’t count as part of character
wealth for this, as the game’s attitude to them is more similar to early D&amp;amp;D
than modern Pathfinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after all of that I think we can safely say that a Pathfinder 1e gold piece
should be worth around &lt;strong&gt;$5&lt;/strong&gt; in Dungeon Fantasy. This leads to amounts of money
that are sufficient to cover expenses with a little left over in low-level
adventures, and to increasingly bigger hauls in higher-level ones, but as we
established that’s OK. Some of those Pathfinder adventures even helpfully
provide us with domain mini-games of their own that can soak up that extra cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;performing-the-actual-conversion&quot;&gt;Performing the Actual Conversion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that basic exchange rate in mind, we can think about how that affects the
actual treasure our delvers find in the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coins&quot;&gt;Coins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piles of coins change to reflect their new value. The two main approaches you
could take here are to prioritize keeping the same value, or prioritize keeping
the same weight (which means keeping the same number of coins). Getting &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;
value and weight to match is very hard, so I strongly recommend sticking to only
one unless you like solving &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem&quot;&gt;multi-dimensional knapsack problems&lt;/a&gt; in your
spare time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing &lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt; means those coin piles will end up smaller and lighter
than the originals. This will make hauling them off easier. I recommend against
condensing the pile as much as possible, because you don’t want to make
logistics &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; easy. Also, finding a single gold coin can be a bit of a letdown
even if it is worth a lot. This is the easiest approach to take on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing &lt;strong&gt;the number of coins&lt;/strong&gt; means the pile will have exactly the same
size and weight, but it will be made of a smaller denomination coins. Its actual
value will probably be a little higher or lower than that of the original, but
that’s OK as long as the value remains close. This could lead to a situation
where the group only takes the most valuable portions of the pile, but I guess
that’s true to how it was done in Old D&amp;amp;D too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: A chest containing 100gp in Pathfinder should contain $500 in coins
when converted to DF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritizing value might give us a bag containing 25 silvers. That’s a
satisfying number of coins that still has a non-negligible weight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritizing weight might give us a chest containing 80 coppers and 20
silvers, with a total worth of $480.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gems-jewelry-and-art-objects&quot;&gt;Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things tend to have pretty arbitrary values in both systems! The biggest
difference in how they handle selling this stuff in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pathfinder, you can generally exchange them for their full listed value in
cash, making them perfectly efficient forms of portable wealth. PF adventurers
are quite likely to convert their coins into fancy jewelry when they need to
travel long distances, since it’s much lighter for its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Dungeon Fantasy, the only thing that fetches its full value is coin or bulk
precious metals. Everything else, including gems, jewelry, and art objects, is
subject to the rules for appraisal and haggling. This means typical delvers are
likely to get less than full value for this stuff back in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation here is to use a doubled exchange rate: each gp of gems,
jewelry and treasure is worth $10. That’s the treasure’s &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; value, which
means a typical party will get half of that on average when they sell it back in
town. I feel this preserves the “original intention” of the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;magic-items&quot;&gt;Magic Items&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both systems have a lot to say about magic item pricing, so my strategy here is
to not attempt a conversion of the price at all. I convert the &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; of the
item and figure out how much that would cost in Dungeon Fantasy if it was a new
item. Saying it like this makes it sound easy, but this can be complex enough to
warrant its own post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an item can be replicated with the standard enchantments from DF, it has
those enchantments and is priced accordingly. Items with unique functions might
be a bit harder, but I always have the “easy escape” there of just not assigning
a fixed price to these. Like DF Artifacts, they’re either impossible to sell in
the first place, or will be worth some arbitrary amount that matches what I want
the PCs to have at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Hell's Rebels Adventure 3, Part 3</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell's_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we come to the final part of our Let’s Read of the third Hell’s Rebels
adventure, “Dance of the Damned”. With the “regional support” missions complete,
the Rebellion’s stats can grow to their maximum values. We’re almost at the
point where things get real serious in Kintargo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revolution starts with a party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-5-the-ruby-masquerade&quot;&gt;Part 5: The Ruby Masquerade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barzilai Thrune has been organizing a grand masquerade ball to be hosted at the
Opera House ever since the start of this adventure. He advertises it as a way to
reconcile with his critics and to show everything is fine in Kintargo, but of
course it’s a dastardly trap. After the PCs close the Menador Gap he steps up
his time table and announces a date for the event. He might also end up doing it
on his original schedule if the PCs take too long to complete that key mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His plan is to use a troop of dottari and disguised devils to massacre the
ball’s attendants at the party’s climax, and doctor the evidence to blame the
Silver Ravens. This will give him an official excuse to begin hunting them down
in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barzilai sends invitations to every noble or other prominent citizen he knows
does not support him. He’s not stupid enough to believe the PCs would attend if
he invited them directly, so he makes invitations relatively easy to acquire by
other means as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s at this point that the private investigator Tayacet Tiora makes contact
with the PCs. Barzilai had hired her to look into the Silver Ravens, and it’s
even possible they ran into her in previous adventures if the GM decided to use
that scene. This time, she’s found out enough to become convinced the PCs are in
the right, and she comes to warn them that the Masquerade is a trap. Her
recommendation is for the PCs to not attend, but she promises to help if they
insist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply not going is certainly an option. It ensures the safety of the PCs but
lets the trap spring on the innocent guests unopposed. The book also
contemplates the possibility that the PCs will want to break into the Opera
House early, which is actually a good call. The same security forces will be
present and they will be patrolling more aggresively, but there will be no
bystanders. The PCs would miss out on a few extra hob-nobbing opportunities but
would be in a much better tactical position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the adventure assumes the PCs do attend, however. It should be
fairly easy to get invitations for the whole party plus any allies they wish to
take. Tiora will also attend in this case, and be ready to help if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Masquerade starts at 9 PM, and whatever day is most convenient for the
GM. The PCs should have ample time to prepare for this one, growing the
rebellion and aiming their NPC teams at the Opera House to provide
information. It’s even possible to plant an infiltrated saboteur among the
guards. With good rolls they should have a pretty good idea of the security
inside the place, and an extra ally on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;party-mechanics&quot;&gt;Party Mechanics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual ball is a bit of a skill challenge in the same vein as the Vyre
banquet. There’s an official dress code: outfits should include the color red,
everyone must wear a mask, and both should be fancy. Fortunately they can pass
anything up to medium armor and shields as part of the costume, but it’s
definitely worth it to have it adorned and to splurge on extravagant
masks. These give bonuses to social skills during the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like we had Banquet Points in Vyre, here we have Masque Points. PCs start
with an amount between 4 and 16 depending on how fancy their costumes are. NPC
allies they bring with them also affect this total. The ball is split into
half-hour segments, and each PC can perform one of several available actions
during this span of time. Some of these actions cost Masque Points, some can be
used to acquire more with good skill rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless the PCs have been making an effort to ingratiate themselves with the
noble houses during “strategic” play, this is their last real chance to do so
before things heat up. The Kintargo-aligned house heads should all be here, so
the party’s socialites can identify them and chat them up. Having to do this now
does add a layer of complication to the procedures, which is why I like the idea
of introducing this element early in the campaign instead and let players make
their own interaction opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opera-house-layout-and-security&quot;&gt;Opera House Layout and Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Opera House has three floors and an extensive basement. The main seating
areas had all of their seats removed to host the ball. Most guests stay on the
ground floor, but the nobles gravitate towards the second floor balcony because
they like to look down on commoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two floors have a lot of backstage areas off to the sides, and the
third floor and basement are all “backstage”. Many of these areas were converted
in living spaces for Barzilai and his staff. All backstage areas are off-limits
to party guests, so PCs need to be sneaky when exploring them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a total of 22 dottari in the house, half of which attend to the guests
while wearing smiley masks. The other half stands in reserve, waiting for the
trap to spring. The dottari here use the same stats as the Menador soldiers,
with slightly different gear. This means the PCs should be able to handle small
groups of them just fine - the challenge is doing so without raising an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a troop of devils in here: two bone, six bearded, and a single
erinyes. One of the bone devils, Crizmerkis, has a few class levels on him and
is wearing an illusory disguise to look like Barzilai. The real Thrune has
relocated to the temple of Asmodeus, and does not appear in this adventure. The
other bone devil is in the orchestra pit, using his illusion magic to provide
the music for the ball. The remaining monsters are scattered through several
side rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the rooms also contains suspended cages for Barzilai’s pet cockatrices,
which can be released at the press of a switch. Unless the PCs or an ally break
the switch, these creatures will be released when the trap is sprung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are a bunch of secret rooms in a sub-basement that used to belong
to the original Silver Ravens. Barzilai is using them to stash his treasures and
house his “prize” henchthings. Former Mayor Jilia Bailinus sleeps here as a
vampire, and the long-missing singer Shensen is also here as a statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of additional secret chambers Thrune’s lackeys haven’t been
able to find, and which contain valuable Silver Ravens stuff. This includes the
crypts for the original Ravens, which confirm their fates and the fact that
Jackdaw, the last remaining member, might still be alive. And it also includes
the musical score for the Song of Silver, a potent ritual that will greatly help
the PCs in the climax of the rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using rebellion actions the PCs can arm themselves with plenty of information
before going in: a Covert Action can give them the map to the whole building,
even the secret-secret chambers with a good enough roll. And a Sabotage action
can place an infiltrator among the dottari. Once the PCs link up with the
infiltrator during the party, they can learn the composition and location of the
place’s entire security detail, devils included. The saboteur can also break the
cockatrice release switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several rooms that are noted as being rarely visited by both guests
and patrols, which makes them perfect places to hide bodies. So yup, time to
Assassin’s Creed it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delving-the-masquerade&quot;&gt;“Delving” the Masquerade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say those covert actions are so vital that the GM should push for them
to happen if the players have been neglecting that aspect of the game. The PCs
are on the clock here and every little advantage helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party starts at 9PM. At 10PM, they have a special “Dance of the Damned”
event that takes up half an hour. At midnight an unmasking ceremony happens and
Crizmerkis springs the ambush with the aim of killing every single guest in the
house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs should carefully manage their masque points, with some of the party making
an effort to mingle and gain more while the rest spend them on exploration
actions. It’s important that the minglers manage to maintain the point total
above 0, and that the explorers avoid raising a general alarm. Either of these
things will cause Crizmerkis to spring the trap immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participation on the dance is optional, but winning the contest gives a ton of
Masque Points so the minglers will want to participate. This leaves them with 5
other segments on which to decide their actions before the trap is sprung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explorers who refuse to take part in the contest have 6 segments on which to
act. Their priority target here should be taking out the dottari, because
they’re weaker and have less means of raising the alarm (several of the devils
are telepathic and can do so instantly). The less enemies there are at midnight,
the easier the final fight will be. Looting and detailed exploration of the
basement should wait until after the main ambush force is defeated. There are a
few extra monsters down there that will not take part in the ambush, so they can
be safely ignored for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-stroke-of-midnight&quot;&gt;The Stroke of Midnight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At midnight, Crizmerkis (disguised as Barzilai) will stop the music and make an
ominous speech. During the speech, the dottari will split into 11 pairs and
stand guard over every one of the building’s exits, locking those doors in the
process. Attacking them before the speech is done will cost the party a bunch of
Masque Points but will give them a surprise round and a tactical advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist of the speech is that the guests present here have graciously
volunteered themselves to help maintain public order, by being massacred so the
blame can fall on the Silver Ravens and Barzilai can go after them. As soon as
it ends, the devils attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 300 guests in the house, not counting the PCs. The “spare” bone devil
and the erinyes will focus on slaughering them, while the bearded devils and
Crizmerkis will come for the PC directly. Most of them will be disguised as good
outsiders using illusions, but additional summoned devils and such will not have
disguises on. The PCs can draw the attention of the bone devil and erinyes by
engaging them in combat. If cornered, Crizmerkis might summon the vampire Jillia
Bailinus to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why killing the dottari early helps: if there are less of them, they’re
going to leave some of those exits unlocked and unprotected. The PCs &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; open
the exits so guests can leave: 1d6 guests escape every round for every unlocked
exit. With no open exits, 2d6 of them die every round to sheer crushing crowd
pressure. Those two devils kill even more per round if left alone. If you’re
using GURPS, read “every round” as “every six seconds”, otherwise things might
get a little impossible here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results-and-consequences&quot;&gt;Results and Consequences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event will go down in history as the Ruby Massacre. Whether the PCs or
Thrune are blamed for it depends on how well they do in this final fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs win the big fight they should have plenty of time to explore the rest
of the opera house. They’ll get to fight a pack of hellhounds being used as
guard animals in the basement, find Vampire Jilia’s coffing and stake her, and
find Shensen and the Song of Silver. There’s also a lot of other cool loot to be
had, including a scroll of resurrection that can be used to bring the former
Mayor back to life after she’s destroyed as a vampire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs loose, they’ll find themselves waking up inside a cell in Castle
Kintargo. Either way as soon as they leave the opera house we transition
directly to Volume 04, where we go full Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Notes and Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book makes that final battle sound quite difficult, particularly if the PCs
didn’t prepare for it by coming into the party armed and taking out some of the
opposition ahead of time. Even if they did, it’s going to be hard to save all
the bystanders. Dungeon Fantasy delvers should have it a bit easier because
the GURPS version of these opponents won’t have HP in the triple digits, but
it’s going to be tough even for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same emphasis on etiquette from the Vyre banquet is present here, but here
it makes less sense given the surrounding context. The Silver Ravens only get
diplomatic/strategic benefits from thwarting the ambush if they have more than
20 Masque Points by the time the ambush starts. I guess this is supposed to
represent the final impression left on the survivors about who is to blame for
the massacre, but it feels odd to have the party save these people in a very
obvious manner and not be recognized for it. I’d say that saving the heads of
the noble houses at least should be more than enough to get them on-side for the
next adventure, if that hasn’t happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs have been buttering up the nobles on their own initiative prior to
this point, then the best strategic decision they can make is to break into the
opera house days before the ball, preferrably during daylight hours so the
vampire isn’t a factor. All the same enemies will still be there, but the whole
party can focus on exploring the area and taking them out. They’ll completely
forfeit the possible diplomatic rewards from the Masquerade, but not having to
split their focus between delving and socializing or rescuing bystanders is more
than worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Bladesinger</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tl-dr&quot;&gt;TL; DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play a swordmage or hexblade instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard of bladesingers back in the days of 2e, when they were first
introduced as an elf-only character kit that gave a lot of powerful combat
bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a member of a couple Brazilian RPG mailing lists where people either loved
or hated them. Their fans were also elf fans in general, and their haters were
usually GMs who thought it made the character “too anime”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never actually read the original bladesinger writeup, so I didn’t take sides
in that fight. But having read the Bladesinger class as presented in the 4e
Neverwinter Campaign Setting, I have to say I’m not their greatest fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re probably the greatest departure from the design principles established
in the PHB classes, far more extreme in that regard than even the Essentials
classes from the “Heroes” books. They feel very much like a return to the design
philosophy of previous editions. Or perhaps they’re “foreshadowing”: while 5e
hadn’t come out yet when this book was published, it was probably already in
development, and one of its major goals was to recapture the feel of those
older editions. In either way, they feel very dissonant to me when placed
alongside other 4e classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book spends a whole page describing bladesingers as the epitome of elven
superiority. The text feels like it was written by a sun elf. The term
Tel’Quessir is used a lot here but not explained. I assume it means “the elven
people”, but I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the book, the art of the Bladesong was developed by Corellon
himself, and has been passed down among the elven people for an untold number of
their extremely long generations. Even among elves, few individuals are worthy
of receiving its teachings, for one must have the mind of a great wizard and the
agility of a great dancer to even comprehend its awesomeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their techniques are passed directly from master to student, and were never
written down anywhere. When the last bladesinger dies, so does the mystery and
beauty of their art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All bladesingers are completely devoted to upholding and defending the ways of
the Tel’Quessir, for such is the purpose Corellon gave them. Few bladesingers
deign to leave their homelands - those who do so are surely in pursuit of some
mission or relic vital to the Tel’Quessir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See those last three paragraphs? They’re almost direct quotes from the book. I’m
barely paraphrasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-information&quot;&gt;Basic Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bladesingers are presented as a Wizard subclass, which is the kind of
presentation I would expect to see in 5e but not here. The book says you should
play one of them if you want to be someone who can both participate in melee
combat and cast arcane spells. So you could perhaps see them as the Essentials
version of the Swordmage, at least in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, they’re described as arcane controllers, because of the “wizard
subclass” thing, and they get Striker-like HP and healing surges. They still get
the wizard’s +2 to Will, and a fairly large list of class skills: Acrobatics,
Arcana, Athlethics, Diplomacy, History, Intimidate, Nature and Perception. A
bladesinger’s key abilities are Intelligence and Dexterity, in that
order. They’re proficient with cloth and leather armor, with all simple and
military weapons, and with wizard implements (wand, orb, staff).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the only class in the entire edition that seems to have a hard
racial requirement: no self-respecting Bladesong master would teach it to anyone
who is not an elf or eladrin. Once in a great while, a half-elf might earn the
honor, but even that’s a bit scandalous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eladrin are pretty much ideal bladesingers since they get bonuses to both Int
and Dex. Other Int/Dex ancestries are likely to be just as effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;powers-and-features&quot;&gt;Powers and Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a full 30-level writeup for the class. Like the other Essentials classes,
this one comes with an exclusive Paragon Path (Sorcerous Sword) and you have no
reason to pick anything else. You have a little more freedom of choice for your
epic destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;level-1&quot;&gt;Level 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an incredibly front-loaded class, with a very long list of level 1
features. They all have slightly different requirements to work, but the
combined result this: you want to wear at most light armor, and you want to
wield a light or heavy blade in one hand, and either a wand or nothing at all in
the other. Let’s call this the Bladesinger Requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do fulfill the Bladesinger Requirement, you can use your the following
list of benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You use Int instead of your Strength for both attack and damage when making
 basic melee attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You gain a +2 shield bonus to AC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t provoke opportunity attacks when using ranged or area attacks. This
is a bit less awesome than it sounds because of how your powers work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use your sword as an implement for powers that require one. As usual
in these cases, you don’t add its proficiency bonus to the attack roll, but
you do add its magic item bonus to attack and damage, and its critical dice
when you score a critical hit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then pick three Bladespells from a set of six - these are your at-will
powers, and they all work the same. They don’t use actions, and trigger when you
hit an enemy with a melee basic attack while fulfilling the Bladesinger
Requirement. Each is a Ranged 10 attack that does automatic (Dex Mod) damage of
a different elemental type and has a different controller-y rider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dancing Fire&lt;/strong&gt;: Fire damage, target grants CA until the end of your next
turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dazzling Sunray&lt;/strong&gt;: Radiant damage, target has -2 to attack until the end of
your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frost Bite&lt;/strong&gt;: Cold damage, target is slowed until the end of your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lighting Ring&lt;/strong&gt;: Lightning damage, target gets damaged again if they move
before the end of your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Sever&lt;/strong&gt;: Necrotic damage and you knock target prone if it’s the same
size as or smaller than the target of the triggering melee attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unseen Hand&lt;/strong&gt;: Force damage and you slide the target 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the bonuses above, Bladespells don’t provoke an opportunity attack.
They also don’t have to target the same creature you just hit, but you can only
use one of them per attack. Their damage increases by 2 per tier past
Heroic. Looks like Shadow Sever and Unseen Hand are more or less automatic picks
here, their riders are much better. The third pick would depend on your party’s
abilities and what benefits them the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not done with the Level 1 powers yet. You get three cantrips chosen from
the traditional list of Prestidigitation, Ghost Sound, Mage Hand, Light and
Suggestion. And then you get the errataed version of Magic Missile, the one that
always hits for minimal force damage. That’s another spell I like more in its
PHB 1 form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, you get the Bladesong encounter power. If you’re fulfilling the
Bladesinger Requirement, you can use this as a minor action to slip into a fancy
bullet time trance that gives you a +2 power bonus to attack rolls and all
defenses, and a +5 power bonus to damage rolls. This lasts until the end of your
next turn, which means you can get 2 turns’ worth of Bladesong if you use it as
your first action on your turn. There is no other way to extend its
duration. The word &lt;em&gt;rolls&lt;/em&gt; there means it doesn’t benefit your bladespells or
Magic Missile, but it does affect your basic attacks and spells that have damage
rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spellcasting-and-the-rest-of-the-levels&quot;&gt;Spellcasting and the Rest of the Levels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That huge list of level 1 stuff seems pretty nifty, and there’s so much of it!
Unfortunately it also represents most of what you’ll be doing through your whole
career, because the rest of your powers are kinda underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with spellcasting, the main reason why this is presented as a wizard
subclass and also the main way in which it breaks from this edition’s usual
class design philosophy. You see, bladesingers bring Vancian spellcasting back
to 4e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They get to pick encounter and utility powers as they advance in level, but
these are treated much like wizard spells were in 3e instead of being a set of
class-specific powers. While their possible choices are all detailed in the
class description, they are also literally “taken from the wizard spell list” in
that they’re copied from that class’s list of powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a table showing at which levels they learn new spells. At set levels,
they get to pick either two encounter attack spells or two utilities to add to
their spellbook. After finishing a long rest, a bladesinger can prepare a number
of these spells, detailed in another table. There is no mention of replacing
spells with higher level ones as you level, so I guess they just accumulate in
your spellbook. A level 1 bladesinger knows 2 encounter attack spells and can
prepare 1. A level 30 character knows 14 encounter attack spells and 10
utilities, and can prepare 3 and 5 of them respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say “encounter attack spells”, and they get presented in red boxes, but
they’re only encounter powers for standard wizards. A bladesinger treats them
all as &lt;em&gt;dailies&lt;/em&gt;, and even gets them when other characters would normally get
daily powers. This means the level of the powers lags behind your character
level. At level 5, you pick from a list of level 3 wizard powers, and so on. So
yeah, even “spell level differs from character level” makes a comeback
here. Your reward for reaching level 20 is that you get to pick a single spell
from a list of actual daily attack powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utility powers are less wonky. You get them at the same levels as everyone else,
their level matches yours when you get them, and their frequency of use actually
matches the one in their descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the levels where other characters would get encounter powers, you gain new
class features. These either make your bladespells a little better, or give you
extra bonuses and triggered abilities that only work while your Bladesong is
active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanics-wise, bladesingers feel like the many 3e attempts at making a class
equally skilled at swordplay and magic. Like them, it gives us a class that’s
not that good at either thing as a specialist, and as a result might feel less
powerful and fun in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re labeled as controllers, but they’re not great at it. The majority of
their control ability is going to come from their three bladespells, which will
usually only affect one enemy at a time. They need to wait until level 24 to be
able to target multiple enemies with a bladespell, and they can only do that
once per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those “encounter as daily” Vancian spells can let them exert more control, but
they’re weaker and scarcer than what a “proper” controller of the same level has
access to. In a party with a wizard, invoker, or psion, the bladesinger will be
overshadowed as a controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re better when viewed as strikers. Bladesong’s bonuses to basic attacks and
damaging spells provide an appreciable damage increase. However, I don’t think
they do so as consistently as the powers and features of a dedicated striker
class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conclusion here is the same one I added to the helpful TL; DR section at the
start of this post: play something else. Like a swordmage, for example! These
great PHB-style arcane defenders do a much better job of letting you play
someone who is equally skilled at swordplay and magic. Their lore is also far
less snobbish, though you can still call your swordmage a bladesinger if you
want without changing anything about their mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swordmages can be found in the 4e Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, which as a
bonus includes a lot of information on the wider world of Toril where
Neverwinter is located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you want to be a elf-flavored striker, you could go with a fey
pact Hexblade warlock, who can be found in Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms. One
of the characters labeled as a bladesinger here was in fact a hexblade warlock
in that book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story-wise, I guess they intended this to be the class of choice for the
Iliyanbruen Guardian, but I would probably choose Swordmage even so. The only
thing that could make me play a bladesinger would be if I could something other
than an elf or eladrin, just so I could make fun of the snobbish flavor text. A
pixie from the Player’s Guide to the Feywild would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bladesinger class is the last section of Chapter 2. In our next post we’ll
begin looking at the GM-focused material of Chapter 3, &lt;strong&gt;Factions and Foes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Torm Domain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Torm, the Loyal Fury, seems to be your typical “paladinic” god of justice and
honor. His warpriests pursue justice in an unjust world and act with honor
towards those who have none. His domain is by far the most recommended for the
other FR gods, being applicable to any god who has a militant or compassionate
bent, from Bahamut to Ilmater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics&quot;&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warpriests of Torm are pretty much Wisdom-based warlords. Their riders boost
ally attacks and defenses or allow quick repositioning, in much the same way the
different warlord powers do. The optimization forums say this is probably the
most varied domain around in terms of what it lets you do - it’s hard to get
bored playing a warpriest of Torm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that jumped out to me is their Level 1 utility power, which they get
to keep throughout their whole careers: &lt;strong&gt;True Strike&lt;/strong&gt;! This is an &lt;em&gt;at-will&lt;/em&gt;
power that lets them spend a Standard action to grant a +4 bonus to an ally’s
next attack. It’s not quite as fun as the Lazy-Lord’s signature ability, but
it’s the closest you can get to it in an Essentials-only campaign. It’s also
super-useful for setting up big attacks with encounter or daily powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as in FR, this power set could fit a lot of different core deities. The
lore’s focus on justice make it a good fit for Bahamut and Moradin, and the
tactical nature of its powers could allow it to stand in for the domains of
non-Good “strategist” gods like the unaligned Erathis or the evil Bane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for domains. Next we’ll look at a full class, the infamous
bladesinger.&lt;/p&gt;
