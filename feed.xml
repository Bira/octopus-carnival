  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A large spider made of translucent crystal.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark Sun is still a D&amp;amp;D setting. Therefore it needs giant spiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athasian giant spiders behave much like their kin from other worlds. They prefer
locations that afford them plenty of hiding and ambush spots like caves, deep
valleys, and so on. While neither of the varieties presented here can spin webs
fast enought to do so during combat, they still might cover entire chasms or
large passages in them as they wait for more prey to wander by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crystal-spider&quot;&gt;Crystal Spider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the prettiest monsters in the Tablelands, its carapace is made of actual
crystal. Aside from the usual venomous bite and their razor-sharp appendages,
crystal spiders also have smome power over light and are capable of radiant
attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crystal Spiders are Large Natural Beasts and Level 4 Lurkers with 39 HP. Their
ground and Spider Climb speeds are both 8, and they have Tremorsense 10 to
detect people touching their webs. Their carapace makes gives them Resist 5
Radiant, but also Vulnerable 5 Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also gives them the &lt;strong&gt;Gleaming Carapace&lt;/strong&gt; trait, which gives them concealment
until the end of their next turn any time they move more than 5 squares in the
same action. I guess glare is a major problem with fighting crystal spiders on
their home turf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is a decently damaging &lt;strong&gt;Razor Leg&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 2), and they can
use a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 1 vs. Fort) against a target that cannot see them, dealing
both immediate and 10 ongoing poison damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crystal spiders could achieve that unseen state by moving more than 5 squares
and hiding, but they have a couple of shortcuts in the form of their
light-bending powers. &lt;strong&gt;Radiant Agony&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 2 vs. Fort) pushes its
targets 3 squares and blinds them for a turn, recharging whenever no one is
blinded or when the spider hits with its bite. &lt;strong&gt;Brilliant Ray&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10
vs. Ref, recharge 5+) does a good chunk of radiant damage and blinds for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crystalline-web&quot;&gt;Crystalline Web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any place where crystal spiders hunt will be filled with these razor sharp
traps. They’re statted up as Level 4 Obstacles, each consisting of a patch of
webbing 4x4 squares in size, stretched between two surfaces. They’re
semi-transparent and require a DC 14 Perception check to notice in bright light,
or 19 in dim light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a character enters a web square, the web attacks their Reflex, doing
immediate and ongoing 5 physical damage on a hit (save ends). Hit or miss, the
target’s movement ends and it gets pushed back to the last square it occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A character can use Acrobatics (DC 14) to move through a webbed square, or they
can attack the web and deplete its 25 HP to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An elite version of this trap has 50 HP instead, and deals increased damage when
it catches someone. In either case, good luck dodging these in dim light or
while blinded by the crystal spiders who made them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book doesn’t explicily state it, but I would say crystal spiders should be
immune to the effects of their own webs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;white-widow&quot;&gt;White Widow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White Widows are a bigger, stronger, and &lt;em&gt;stealthier&lt;/em&gt; relative of the crystal
spider. While they lack the ability to fire lasers, they still have some control
over light and like to blind their prey. They’re Huge Natural Beasts and Level
15 Lurkers with 110 HP, resist 10 poison and radiant, and Vulnerable 10
thunder. Their speed and senses are the same as a crystal spider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason white widows like to blind their prey is that they deal 15 ongoing
“poison and radiant” damage (save ends) when they hit blinded targets with any
attack. Yes, this means their venom is deadly even to things that are normally
resistant or immune to poison. This trait is named &lt;strong&gt;Combat Advantage&lt;/strong&gt; but
that name is misleading, as it only grants its benefit against &lt;em&gt;blinded&lt;/em&gt;
targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spider’s &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; is a basic attack that also deals “poison and radiant”
damage, but it’s not going to be used on its own unless conditions are
right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of biting it can turtle up and use its &lt;strong&gt;Reflective Defense&lt;/strong&gt;, which
gives it a +5 bonus to all defenses for a turn and blinds anyone who misses them
with an attack during that time. The &lt;strong&gt;Scuttling Attack&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver (recharge 5+)
lets it shift half its speed, bite someone, and shift the other half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hit by a fire, radiant or lightning attack (in other words, anything shiny)
the spider can react with the &lt;strong&gt;Venomous Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; attack, enhancing and reflecting
that light back at its attackers. This is a Close Burst 5 vs. Reflex, deals
radiant damage, and blinds (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;widows-web&quot;&gt;Widow’s Web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any battle against white widows will happen in a place filled with
these. They’re not sharp like a crystal spider’s, but they’re still quite
dangerous as Level 15 Obstacle traps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White widow web patches are 10x10 squares in size and require a DC 22 Perception
check to notice in dim light, but are automatically visible in bright
light. The web attacks the Reflex of anyone who enters one of its squares, and
restrains on a hit (save ends). Webbed squares are also difficult terrain to
anyone without the Spider Climb ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters can avoid the trap by leaping over webbed terrain, or destroy the web
by dealing 40 HP of damage to it. An elite version has double the HP and can
take two opportunity attacks per turn, which is useful in case two or more
targets get pushed into it in the same action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll mostly commonly be meeting these spiders singly or in pairs, with the
rest of the encounter balance being made up of web patches. They can appear
anywhere you would expect to find the standard varieties of D&amp;amp;D giant spider,
which also exist in Athas because why wouldn’t they?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Silt Runner</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-silt-runner.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A silt-runner, which looks like a little purple lizard dude running very
    fast while carrying a spear.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silt Runners are basically Athasian Kobolds. While they’re not described as
“savage”, all of the usual kobold slander is also present here. They’re small
reptilian humanoids who are intensely xenophobic and whose entire society is
based on raiding other humanoid settlements. They wield stolen weapons and wear
bits of clothing and body parts from their victims as trophies, eating the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main differences here seem to be that Silt Runners are more related to
ssurrans (Athasian lizardfolk) than to dragons, and that they’re much more
nomadic and aggressive. They gather in warrens linked by tunnels and located
near their prospective raid targets, but are quick to abandon those hideouts
when their targets attempt a retaliatory strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, silt runners hate the fey, and have been known to ignore far
more vulnerable targets in favor of attacking well-protected elves and eladrin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silt Runners are low-level and fit right alongside kobolds as Small Natural
Humanoids with the Reptile tag. But while standard kobolds have the Shifty
trait, Silt Runners have &lt;strong&gt;Silt Runner Swarm&lt;/strong&gt;, which causes any enemy adjacent
to 2 or more silt runners to take 2 damage at the start of their turn. They also
have low-light vision and a surprisingly zippy ground speed of 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;silt-runner-darter&quot;&gt;Silt Runner Darter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Level 1 Artillery menaces have 25 HP and wield blowguns with an assortment
of darts. They keep to the edges of the battle and shoot whoever they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Blowgun&lt;/strong&gt; deals standard damage and has Range 12, so they can keep a fair
distance away from the scrum. Some of their shots will be with &lt;strong&gt;Poisoned
Darts&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), which deal heavy poison damage and immobilize (save
ends). As an aftereffect, the target is slowed (save ends). A miss deals half
damage and slows for a turn, which is very strong for a rechargeable attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If engaged in melee, they can defend themselves with &lt;strong&gt;Wooden Daggers&lt;/strong&gt;, but
those are nothing to write home about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;silt-runner-rager&quot;&gt;Silt Runner Rager&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ragers are Level 1 Brutes with 34 HP. The &lt;strong&gt;Bone Spears&lt;/strong&gt; they wield look
comically large, but have Reach 2 and are very effective. In addition to
standard attacks, they can use them in &lt;strong&gt;Brutal Spear&lt;/strong&gt; maneuvers that deal
increased damage and recharge when first bloodied, or in a &lt;strong&gt;Penetrating Spear&lt;/strong&gt;
maneuver that also deals increased damage and makes the target Vulnerable 5 to
all damage for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;silt-runner-inciter&quot;&gt;Silt Runner Inciter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a Level 2 Controller with the Leader tag and 38 HP. If they had a PC
class, they would be Ardents, as they have psionic powers capable of causing
strong emotions on their allies - fury, in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inciters can make a decent show of themselves in melee with their &lt;strong&gt;Bone
Swords&lt;/strong&gt;, and they can attack at range with a &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Detonation&lt;/strong&gt; (area 1
within 10, recharge 6+) that deals force damage and creates a zone that lasts
for a turn and is difficult terrain for enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also &lt;strong&gt;Incite Fury&lt;/strong&gt; in a close blast 5, causing each ally within the
blast to shift 1 square and make a free basic attack either before or after the
shift. When first bloodied, they can do that again as a free action, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;
Incite Fury recharges, which means they could use this power a total of three
times per encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inciters want to drop that difficult terrain zone as soon as possible and then
have their allies swarm the PCs caught inside so that Incite Fury is maximally
effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silt Runners mostly stick together, but will sometimes cooperate with other
reptilian humanoids, and keep reptilian beasts as pets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, they’re Athasian Kobolds. You can easily take standard kobold stat
blocks, increase their speed to 7, and replace Shifty with Silt Runner Swarm to
increase your collection of silt runner stat blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dungeon Fantasy &quot;Monster&quot;: Recap</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m going to write this in the same format I use for my Monster Manual Let’s
Reads, even though it’s not really a “monster”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These plump mushrooms are a about a foot tall when fully grown, and have purple
caps. They’re very distantly related to shriekers, but their abilities are much
more specialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone disturbs a recap, the mushroom scans the person’s memories and
loudly summarizes the most important events of the last week or so of their
lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Most important” here is defined by what’s foremost in the target’s minds. Yes,
they do have a tendency to spill closely held secrets that are big sources of
anxiety or regret for the victim. Some believe recaps they were originally
developed by an underground civilization with a strong tradition in psionics to
act as interrogation tools. Nowadays you can find them in the wild inside caves
and other damp and dark places, like many dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least one investigator on the surface is known to carry a potted recap around
in a specially built cage, using it for its original purpose when questioning
suspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the victim manages to resist the mind reading attempt, the recap
will still speak a bunch of unconnected nonsense words for a minute or so. Those
who are mainly concerned about noise should refrain from touching them at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recaps aren’t “monsters” in a literal sense. Despite their radio-announcer
voices, they’re nonsapient and immobile. A good whack with any weapon will
destroy your typical recap. In GURPS, it has SM -5, DR 0, and 1 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wild-recap-cluster&quot;&gt;Wild Recap Cluster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wild, recaps grow in clusters and work like traps. Clusters are usually
on the ground, but might also grow on walls or ceilings. If one mushroom in the
cluster is disturbed by a touch at least strong enough to jostle it, the whole
cluster “activates” and performs its narration as one big speaker. Actual damage
also counts, of course - if a damaging attack leaves at least one recap
standing, it will activate on the next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recap cluster takes up 1 hex and has the following stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detect&lt;/em&gt;: Clusters are usually big enough to be plainly visible. Roll
&lt;strong&gt;Naturalist&lt;/strong&gt; at -2 to identify the mushrooms as recaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disarm&lt;/em&gt;: No. Attacks that deal at least 6 damage to the whole hex at once will
completely destroy all the recaps before they can activate. Anything less will
trigger them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avoid&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;DX&lt;/strong&gt; at -5 or &lt;strong&gt;Light Walk&lt;/strong&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;Silence&lt;/strong&gt; spell will render the
cluster harmless for as long as it lasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Save&lt;/em&gt;: Quick Contest of &lt;strong&gt;Will&lt;/strong&gt; against skill 16 to avoid having your mind
read. &lt;strong&gt;Magic Resistance&lt;/strong&gt; helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Effect&lt;/em&gt;: About a minute of loud noises. If the target won the contest of Will,
this will be a string of nonsense words. If they lost, the recap will summarize
the previous week of their lives as if it was the last episode of a radio
serial, potentially airing some dirty laundry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shots&lt;/em&gt;: Constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rearm&lt;/em&gt;: No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steal&lt;/em&gt;: Roll against &lt;strong&gt;Naturalist&lt;/strong&gt; to harvest one large, healthy recap
specimen per hex. This weights 1 lb. and is worth $1000 if delivered intact to
the right people back in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recap-inquisitor&quot;&gt;Recap Inquisitor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This consists of a large, healthy recap specimen planted on good soil in a clay
pot, surrounded by small but sturdy iron cage with large gaps between the
bars. It’s used by the “right people” back in town or by unscrupulous villains
in interrogations. They just need to ask (or force) the subject to poke the
mushroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject must win a quick contest of &lt;strong&gt;Will&lt;/strong&gt; against a skill of 16 to
prevent the ‘shroom from narrating all their dirty laundry from the past seven
days. It will speak a string of nonsense words if the subject resists, and
experienced handlers will know what that means. The cage offers DR 7 against
swinging attacks and other impacts (such as dropping the device), but the large
gaps mean it doesn’t protect against thrusting ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recap Inquisitors cost $2000 and weight 10 lbs. Monthly maintenance requires
$100 in supplies and success in a &lt;strong&gt;Naturalist&lt;/strong&gt; roll to keep the ‘shroom alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;additional-notes&quot;&gt;Additional Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put in the same resistance mechanics for the two entries but I think they’re
mostly relevant for an interrogation scenario. When you step onto a recap patch
in the wild it’s probably funnier if they just succeed and narrate your last
week. It might even be fun to have the PC’s player do the narration if they’re
so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say this because in my experience PCs rarely have something to hide from each
other, so there wouldn’t be really any dirty laundry that they didn’t want
aired. Of course, if you your group &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a party of sneaky gits who do keep
important secrets from each other, then you should probably keep the resistance
test in place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Silt Horror</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-silt-horror.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A silt horror devouring a group of adventurers.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, the only sea most Athasians know is the Sea of Silt. The
name here is pretty descriptive - an endless expanse of silvery dust that makes
up the eastern “border” of the Tyr Region. You can sail on it using special
vessels, and its depths conceal many ruins of extinct civilizations, as well as
an extensive ecosystem that’s a mystery to most surfacers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who have more experience with the Sea of Silt might know of the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2025/06/10/wir-dscc-floating-mantle.html&quot;&gt;Floating
Mantles&lt;/a&gt; who sometimes wander into land, but the thing they fear the most is
the aptly named Silt Horror. These enormous beasts are more or less Darker and
Sunnier krakens, emerging from the deep to wrestle entire ships with their
grasping tentacles and devour them with their bottomless maws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s for the “basic” version that appears close to shore, the one with
white tentacles. Silt sailors who have ventured further away from shore come
back with stories about horrors with brown or gray tentacles who are even
larger - some of them larger than entire city-states. Are these tales true? Who
knows? It’s not like it’s easy to fact-check them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only get the “basic” white-tentacled silt horror here. The bigger versions,
if they exist, are left as an exercise for the GM. Unlike a standard D&amp;amp;D Kraken,
the silt horror is not sapient, but that doesn’t make it less dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature is so large that we get a stat block for the main body and a couple
of different stat blocks for its tentacles, which act like minions and
regenerate fast enough to keep coming back in the same fight after being
“slain”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;silt-horror&quot;&gt;Silt Horror&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main body of the creature is a Huge Aberrant Beast and a Level 12 Solo
Lurker with 496 HP. It has a ground speed of 2 and a burrow speed of 6 on soft
earth, which is like a swim speed on the Sea of Silt. It’s Blind, and therefore
immune to the blinded conditions and to all gaze attacks. It perceives the world
via Termorsense 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horror’s main trait covers its &lt;strong&gt;Regenerating Tentacles&lt;/strong&gt;. Any time when the
horror has less than 4 tentacles within 20 squares of itself, a number of new
tentacles appear until it has 4. The horror chooses which types they are from
the three available (constricting, raking, sweeping). They appear above ground
even if the main body is burrowing, and act on their own initiative, rolled when
they appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main body itself has a fairly basic &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; attack, but the star of the
show here is the &lt;strong&gt;Chomping Maw&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver, which deals almost double the damage
and can target up to two creatures. The restriction here is that the main body
must be entirely underground to attack, and the targets must be grabbed by
tentacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a move action, it can &lt;strong&gt;Submerge&lt;/strong&gt;, burrowing its way to a space that’s
entirely underground. This recharges whenever it’s on the surface, so it’s more
or less at will. And when one of its tentacles is reduced to 0 HP with a melee
attack, it can make a free melee attack of its own before disappearing, dealing
10 extra damage and pushing the triggering PC 5 squares instead of grabbing
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;silt-horror-tentacles&quot;&gt;Silt Horror Tentacles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three tentacle types are very similar to each other, so we’ll cover them
in the same entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the common traits: all three are Level 12 Minions. They have ground and
burrow speeds of 6, and act as sensory organs with the same Tremorsense 20 as
the main body. They’re obviously &lt;strong&gt;Attached&lt;/strong&gt; to the silt horror and cannot be
more than 20 squares from the main body. They’re also &lt;strong&gt;Unhindered&lt;/strong&gt;, which as
we know means they can pull any grabbed victims along with them when they move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three tentacles have a basic &lt;strong&gt;Seize&lt;/strong&gt; attack, which deals physical damage
and grabs the victim. The stats that vary between the three types are their
creature roles, and what they can do with a grabbed victim using their second
attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constricting&lt;/strong&gt; tentacles are Soldiers and their &lt;strong&gt;Constricting Grab&lt;/strong&gt;
damages and dazes the victim for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raking&lt;/strong&gt; tentacles are Skirmishers and their &lt;strong&gt;Sweeping Grab&lt;/strong&gt; damages and
slides the victim 3 squares to a space adjacent to the tentacle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sweeping&lt;/strong&gt; tentacles are Brutes and their &lt;strong&gt;Suffocating Grab&lt;/strong&gt; damages and
knocks prone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after the special attacks, the victims remain grabbed - use the standard
rules to try to get away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silt Horrors will most likely be found alone. They’re not sapient so they don’t
form alliances, and they’re impossible to tame. At most you might find them
already fighting another victim, such as a different ship, or a giant who was
wading through the Sea. These fellow targets might be friendly to the PCs, or
they might not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is an horror intruding upon an already ongoing fight against
those other ships or giants…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanics here are very interesting. The tentacles want to grab as many
victims as possible and do nasty things to them while bringing them closer to
the main body’s location. The main body wants to stay underground until two
victims are in reach, use Chomping Maw on them, and then use Submerge to get
away again. As long as at least one PC remains grabbed, the horror could do this
every turn.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Silk Wyrm</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-silk-wyrm.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A silk wyrm, which looks like a very large snake covered in a segmented
    green carapace, and whose grinning mouth is about three times as wide as its
    head.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silk Wyrms are snakelike monsters covered in chitinous carapaces. They’re gifted
with many natural weapons: bites laced with paralytic venom and the psionic
powers of flight, camouflage, and mesmerism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though incapable of communicating in humanoid languages they’re tenacious
endurance predators who employ clever hunting strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silk Wyrms will shadow their intended prey for days, looking for a time when its
guard is down. The book is not too specific about the nature of this prey. It
could be an adventuring party, a traveling caravan with humanoids and several
kinds of pack animal, or something like a pack of baazrags or other wild
animals. What matters is that the prey is easy to hunt and can be eaten “fresh”,
because silk wyrms apparently only eat their victims while they’re alive, and
abandon them when they die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When their intended targets are vulnerable, the silk wyrm will sneak in,
paralyze a chosen victim, and devour them on the spot. If it manages to
incapacitate more than one victim it will drag one of them to its nest, where it
will trap them in silk strands and eat them over the course of the next few days
while they’re still alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silk wyrms band together as hatchlings, but as soon as they reach the adult
stage their deeply antisocial instincts take over and they set off on their own
to become lone hunters. Only after many years do they become wise enough to
overcome this instinct and start allying with other creatures. Some manage to
lead bands of their own younger kin, while others can ally with those creatures
whose telepathy allows them to communicate with the wyrms and buy their service
with easy food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silk Wyrms are Natural Magical Beasts with the Reptile tag and Low-Light
Vision. All silk wyrms have a flight speed, but their flight is Clumsy, which
means they have a -4 penalty to attacks and defenses while on the air. This
means silk wyrms only fly to travel, but they prefer to fight on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at their other traits in each stat block below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;silk-wyrm-hatchling&quot;&gt;Silk Wyrm Hatchling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too frail to set out on their own, hatchlings roam the wastes in bands,
spreading out to scout for prey and emitting a loud chirping noise when they
find it to call their clutch-mates. They’re Medium-sized Level 3 Minion
Skirmishers, with ground and flight speeds of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Blood Scent&lt;/strong&gt; trait means their attacks against bloodied creatures
ignore concealment. These will mostly be &lt;strong&gt;bites&lt;/strong&gt; that deal poison damage and
slow for a turn. When the hatchling hits 0 HP, they release &lt;strong&gt;Silk Strands&lt;/strong&gt; as
a last attack, which deal a bit of acid damage and restrain (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;silk-wyrm-adult&quot;&gt;Silk Wyrm Adult&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their “lone hunter” phase, adults are Large-sized Level 3 Solo Skirmishers
with 174 HP. Their flight speed increases to 8, but remains clumsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adults retain &lt;strong&gt;Blood Scent&lt;/strong&gt;, which works exactly the same way. They will
likely start the encounter in &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Form&lt;/strong&gt; (minor, recharges when first
bloodied), which makes Insubstantial with Phasing and gives them +5 to Stealth
while stopping it from attacking. It can get out of this with a free action, and
will do so shortly after springing its ambush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the wyrm appears in the middle of its targets, and again whenever the power
is charged, it will use &lt;strong&gt;Mesmerizing Dread&lt;/strong&gt; (minor, recharge 4+), which deals
psychic damage to enemies in a Close Burst 5, slides them 3 squares, and
inflicts a -2 penalty to all defenses for a turn. Then it’s bite time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;bites&lt;/strong&gt; deal more poison damage, since they’re not minions, and their
venom becomes stronger. The target is slowed (save ends), which worsens to
immobilized (save ends) on the first save and to helpless (save ends) on the
second failure. &lt;strong&gt;Wyrm Strike&lt;/strong&gt; lets it bite two different targets with one
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helpless is a funny and very worrying condition. It’s funny because going
strictly by the book, you can move and act normally while Helpless. However
you’re never &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; Helpless. The most common way to get this condition is to be
unconscious. In this case, even on a strict reading you’ll still be Restrained
when you fail your second save and become Helpless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being Helpless is worrying because it makes the victim grant combat advantage,
and opens them up to the Coup de Grace action, which is an attack with any
applicable power that auto-crits and kills the target outright if it deals more
than their bloodied value in damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Silk Wyrm manages to get someone immobilized, restrained, or helpless, it
will &lt;strong&gt;Feed&lt;/strong&gt; on them, attacking their Fortitide eating one of their healing
surges, and healing 10 HP. There’s no damage other than this, apparently, which
makes this attack a lot more forgiving in a fight than it would otherwise seem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It someone hits the adult wyrm with a melee or close attack, it can respond with
&lt;strong&gt;Silk Strands&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction. This is a melee 3 attack vs. Reflex, dealing
acid damage and restraining on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;silk-worm-elder&quot;&gt;Silk Worm Elder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elders have lived long enough to learn the value of teamwork despite or perhaps
&lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of the loss of their ability to project silk strands in combat. They
band together with one another or with other powerful allies in order to survive
and keep eating. They’re Level 14 Skirmishers with 125 HP. Not being solos, they
don’t have a blanked +5 on all saves, but they still have that bonus on saves
against Immobilized or Slowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Form&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Mesmerizing Dread&lt;/strong&gt; work exactly the same, with Shadow
Form just making the wyrm Weakened instead of preventing attacks entirely. They
can only &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; once per turn but their venom remains as potent as the
adult’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem here is the damage: both Mesmerizing Dread and the basic bite do
exactly the same damage as the adult’s, which is way, way below what it should
be for a level 14 monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feed&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, does a huge chunk of physical damage (5d10+6) in
addition to deleting a healing surge. It recharges when first bloodied instead
of being at-will, but it no longer has any target restictions. They still really
want to use this in a helpless target if they can, because it’s going to kill
any helpless target with 112 maximum HP or less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, outside of their one or two uses of Feed, elders are significantly less
scary. The venom is still a concern, particularly if they have heavy hitters
with them, but barring errata it seems to me elders were made to rush in, use
Feed once or twice, and escape the fight using Shadow Form and &lt;strong&gt;Serpent
Strike&lt;/strong&gt;, which they still have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the Lore section outlines possible silk wyrm encounters pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, the first two seem okay to me, but the elder is weird. The damage
of their bites and Mesmerizing stare needs a buff. It’d make them more
consistently dangerous despite making their Feed attack a little less impressive
in comparison (as its 28 average damage is not a lot higher than the 22 their
bites would need).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Creature Catalog: Sand Bride</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-sand-bride.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A sand bride, which looks like a pretty lady lounging in an illusory oasis
    that hides a sandstorm.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wouldn’t be a proper D&amp;amp;D monster book without at least one vile seductress
that tries to lure in unsuspecting adventurers with her womanly wiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sand Brides are basically Darker and Sunnier Nymphs. More specifically, they are
the things this world’s surviving nymphs turned into when the ecosystem went to
shit and the Feywild was mostly destroyed. Like a lot of other Athasian fey,
they blame all intelligent natural creatures for their corrupted state, and try
to victimize them as an act of vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their preferred tactic is to build traps and ambush spots out in the desert and
use their illusion powers to disguise them as safe places like oases, sheltering
ruins, or caravan rest stops. Then they disguise themselves as harmless
humanoids and try to lure their targets to the ambush. The illustration and some
of the descriptions imply these “harmless humanoids” are pretty ladies, but they
don’t have to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the victims are at the intended spot, the ambush is sprung, and the sand
bride will use her sand-bending powers and dehydrating touch to kill the
victims, leaving only dried husks behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sand Brides are Medium Fey Humanoids and Level 10 Elite Controllers with an even
200 HP. Despite being living beings they have Darkvision and are immune to
disease and poison, traits commonly found in undead. Their ground speed is 8,
and they have a burrow speed of 6. This &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; say it’s for loose earth only,
so they could theoretically tunnel through rock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Sandform Body&lt;/strong&gt; lets them ignore all difficult terrain, tough they’re
less diffuse than the dune constructs we saw previously. They attack in melee
with a &lt;strong&gt;Dehydrating Touch&lt;/strong&gt; that deals necrotic damage and inflicts -2 to all
defenses for a turn on a hit. At range, they use &lt;strong&gt;Sand Blasts&lt;/strong&gt; that deal
physical damage and push 4 squares. &lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt; lets them make two melee
attacks per action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also employ a &lt;strong&gt;Sand Drown&lt;/strong&gt; power (recharge 5+) if the PCs bunch up
too much. This is an Area 1 Within 10 attack, dealing heavy physical damage and
restraining on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its ability to create illusory terrain is weaponized as an &lt;strong&gt;Insidious Mirage&lt;/strong&gt;
(Encounter), which lets the Sand Bride create a zone 4 squares on a side that
lasts until the end of the encounter. This counts as difficult terrain for
enemies, lets the bride slide enemies who end their turns inside by up to 2
squares as a free action, and can be moved by up to 4 squares as minor action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally they have &lt;strong&gt;Deceptive Veil&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing them to appear as a humanoid
of any species. Piercing the illusion requires an Insight contest against the
bride’s Bluff skill of +15. This doesn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be a pretty lady, but it’s
apparently traditional. The bride’s stats remain the same while disguised, and
she can attack without dropping the illusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sand brides target groups of travelers The creatures are fairly social with each
other and will organize in groups. They can probably ally with other fey too, or
have some Athasian beasts under their control ready to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not overly fond of vile seductress monsters but sand brides seem easy to
reskin into something less cliche while keeping the same tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Rampager</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-rampager.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A rampager, which look like a big green kaiju with a human-like face.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures were known as so-ut in olden times, but most people found that
name wasn’t very descriptive, so now they’re known as Rampagers. And they do
what it says on the tin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, that doesn’t narrow it down by a lot given that we just looked at
Nightmare Beasts, which are also big rampaging monsters. But there are some
important differences: Nightmare Beasts are hateful monsters twisted by the
energies of the Gray who hate all living things; Rampagers are hateful monsters
twisted by vengeful primal spirits who hate all artifice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, they’ll kill anything that gets in their way, but the thing they really
hate are buildings and other constructed signs of civilization. The cloud of
angry elementals that constantly surrounds these creatures fills them with rage
and drives them to seek these things out and utterly destroy them with their
acidic claws. Ruins or new buildings, it doesn’t matter. They will all be razed
to their foundations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who can’t take on a Rampager in direct combat (i.e, most Athasians) might
have a chance to avoid a deadly confrontation by placating the immaterial
spirits that surround the creature via rituals or diplomacy, convincing them to
direct their weapon elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Rampager is a Large Elemental Beast and a Level 21 Solo Brute with 800 HP. It
has Darkvision and a ground speed of 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The angry spirits surrounding the so-ut aren’t modeled as separate creatures and
cannot be targeted in combat, but I think they might be the source of its
&lt;strong&gt;Entropic Presence&lt;/strong&gt; aura (2), which &lt;em&gt;strips immunities and resistances&lt;/em&gt; from
all creatures and objects within. I believe that does include most of the
inherent immunities objects have (such as to poison and necrotic damage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Rampager also has two other passive traits: &lt;strong&gt;Destruction’s Storm&lt;/strong&gt; boosts
its damage while bloodied, and &lt;strong&gt;Soul of Destruction&lt;/strong&gt; boosts it even more
against constructs, objects, and structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its active attacks start with acid-laced Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt;, which deal a hearty
blend of physical and acid damage and penalize AC by -1 until the end of the
encounter on a hit. This accumulates to a maximum of -5. And to top it off they
have the High Crit property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; is Reach 2 and targets Reflex, and seems weak at first, but that’s
just the primary attack. If that hits, the creature makes a secondary attack
against the target’s Fortitude, which weakens and inflicts 30 ongoing poison
damage on a hit (save ends). Entropic Presence makes this as effective against
structures and objects as it would be against flesh and blood enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last attack is the one that gives the Rampager its name: &lt;strong&gt;Destructive
Rampage&lt;/strong&gt; is an at-will power that lets it make three claw and one bite attack
in any order. At most 2 attacks can be directed at the same target, and the
monster can shift 2 squares after each one as an effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Rampager is first bloodied, and again when it drops to 0 HP, it can use
Destructive Rampage as a free action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I wasn’t as impressed by the Rampager’s lore since it comes right after
the Nightmare Beast and the Psurlon, but it’s very in theme for Athas. You could
also easily reskin it as a sort of tarrasque spawn, since both follow similar
themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, I think all the mechanics that combine to make it a menace against
constructs and structures are really cool. I can easily see an adventure where
PCs must somehow direct a rampager to fight something like the Dark Sun version
of the Wandering Tower (originally from Threats to the Nentir Vale). And of
course, if this thing ever meets a Nightmare Beast meet, they’re going to fight,
and while the Rampager as written might not win that one without PC help it can
serve as an important distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book clearly intends for Rampagers to be found alone, since as mentioned
above the spirit cloud is more of an special effect than a separate creature,
mechanically. Nothing stops you from adding some actual epic level elementals to
the encounter if your PCs are higher level, though.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Psurlon</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-psurlon.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A psurlon, which look like a gray-skinned centipede centaur with scythe-like
    forearms and a xenomorh-style head.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, in a world far, far away, there was a civilization whose
mastery of psionics was so complete they decided to merge their entire
population into a single collective god-mind. They failed, and the backlash
destroyed their planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The survivors managed to escape to the Astral Sea, but only as disembodied
consciences. There, they came upon another world that radiated vast amounts of
psychic energy, comparable to their old home. The survivors were drawn to it
like moths to a flame, piercing the barriers that surrounded this new world and
taking over a species of worm that turned out to be particularly receptive to
their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the following generations, these planar refugees would shape their hosts to
be more useful to their mysterious purposes, and would come to prefer their new
bodies over their old humanoid forms. And this is how the psurlons came to be,
though no one in Athas really knows the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some psurlons reside in the Gray, amid the graves of the gods. Many others live
in Athas itself, where they often take human form to infiltrate and spy on the
city-states of the sorcerer-kings, working towards some mysterious goal of their
own. Psurlons are an old people with long memories and extremely advanced
psionic skills, so sometimes they’ll be sought out by powerful psychics,
spellcasters, and historians willing to risk their lives to bargain for
knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psurlons are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts. They have resistance to psychic
damage, a burrow speed, and Tremorsense, though the exact values on these traits
vary per stat block. Their signature ability is &lt;strong&gt;Armored Mind&lt;/strong&gt;, a passive
trait that lets them roll saves against domination both at the start and end of
their turns, even if the condition doesn’t normally end with a save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;psurlon-dustworm&quot;&gt;Psurlon Dustworm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dustworms are specialized infiltrators, disguising themselves as humanoids to
spy on the city-states and on the comings and goings of the
sorcerer-kings. They’re Level 17 Skirmishers with 164 HP. Their ground and
burrow speeds are 8, and they have 5 psychic resistance and Tremorsense 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dustworm can &lt;strong&gt;Change Shape&lt;/strong&gt; as a minor action to appear as a
humanoid. Others need to pass a DC 36 Insight check to detect the
deception. Most dustworms encountered by PCs will start out disguised, and will
do their best to maintain cover until there is no other alternative. Then, they
take their natural shapes and fight, likely attempting to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to Armored Mind, they also project a &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Deadpool&lt;/strong&gt; (aura 5),
which inflicts -2 on enemy saves against ongoing psychic damage. They can attack
in melee with their &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt;, which damage and deal ongoing 5 psychic damage
(save ends). At range, they fling &lt;strong&gt;Mindknives&lt;/strong&gt; which deal psychic damage and
forbid the target from making opportunity attacks for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these attacks can be boosted by &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Augment&lt;/strong&gt;, which triggers
after one of them hits and lets them deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage. This
recharges when the dustworm takes psychic damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can use a &lt;strong&gt;Burrowing Attack&lt;/strong&gt; to burrow half their speed, attack someone
with a claw, and then burrow the other half of their speed. This is strangely
precise phrasing compared to the other “moving attack” skills we have seen so
far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;psurlon-warworm&quot;&gt;Psurlon Warworm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warworms cannot change shape, possibly because they’re Huge instead of
Medium. They defend psurlon settlements and stay hidden underground near
infiltrators, waiting to burst out when things go pear-shaped. They’re Level 18
Elite Brutes with 424 HP. Their ground and burrow speeds are 6, their
Tremorsense is 20, and their psychic resistance is 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; deals heavy damage and inflicts ongoing 5 psychic damage (save
ends), and &lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt; lets them bite twice per action. Once per
encounter, they can let out a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Scream&lt;/strong&gt; that attacks enemies in a Close
Burst 2. A hit deals heavy psychic damage and stuns for a turn. Nasty! A miss
deals half damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;psurlon-mindworm&quot;&gt;Psurlon Mindworm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindworms are powerful seers, able to see many futures at once. They guide their
fellow psurlons to the ones most favorable to their secret objectives. Mindworms
are Level 19 Controllers with 181 HP. Their movement speed is 6, they have 10
Psychic resistance, and Tremorsense 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their additional passive is a &lt;strong&gt;Whispering Meme&lt;/strong&gt; aura (5) that lets the
mindworm slide enemies that start their turns within 1 square. I guess the
mysterious whispers of “this is fine” and “always has been” drive enemies to
distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mindworm will probably start the fight at range and attempt to use &lt;strong&gt;Ego
Control&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) on a PC. This deals a sizable chunk of psychic damage
and dominates on a hit (save ends). Then they’ll close in to melee range and
alternate between &lt;strong&gt;Referred Pain&lt;/strong&gt; and their &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Claws&lt;/strong&gt;. The first power
is a Close Burst 2 that deals psychic damage and slows for a turn; the other is
a basic attack that deals a mix of psychic and physical damage and inflicts -2
to AC for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindworms can also &lt;strong&gt;Change Shape&lt;/strong&gt; and use &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Augment&lt;/strong&gt;, both of which
work just like the dustworm’s, but with higher numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot here that reminds me of mind flayers, but I think I actually like
psurlons better. With mind flayers, you know they want to eat your brain, and
most PCs will start drawing their weapons as soon as they spot one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psurlons have a much more mysterious goal, so they can more easily fill the
“mysterious but dangerous stranger” role instead of always being overtly
hostile. Heck, PCs might want to ally with them against a sorcerer-king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, they do employ a lot of the same tactics as flayers, including
keeping large groups of dominated thralls around to help compose mixed encounter
groups.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Nightmare Beast</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-nightmare-beast.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A rampaging nightmare beast with a doomed human spearman for scale. The
    spearman looks tiny.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nightmare Beasts are among the most feared horrors to walk the surface of Athas,
second only to the Dragon of Tyr itself. The mere presence of a nightmare beast
poisons the surrounding land and contaminates its water. This seems to be a
continuous defiling effect - and the beasts can defile further to fuel their
powers. The description also makes me think they might be &lt;em&gt;radioactive&lt;/em&gt;, if you
want to inject some science fantasy into your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sages can only speculate as to their origin. The leading theory is that they
were summoned from the Gray by powerful defilers during an age in the distant
past where war raged all over the world. Fully grown beasts are solitary, but
smaller versions can be seen hanging out in packs with each other or with other
predatory animals. Those same sages theorize these are young beasts, born
through natural reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything about the preceding paragraph is wrong, however. Nightmare beasts
form when one of the many natural predators of Athas consumes too much prey from
areas tainted by the Gray or marked by heavy defiling. The creature begins to
slowly mutate. It acquires intelligence, power, and a hatred for all living
things, becoming a nightmare beast when the metamorphosis is complete. The
“spawn” are merely beasts whose transformation is still ongoing. Fully
transformed beasts are solitary. Partially-mutated spawn still display behaviors
reminiscent of their previous form, which is why they can be found in packs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nightmare beast lairs tend to be pretty obvious and imposing landmarks at the
center of a horribly corrupted region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nightmare Beasts are Shadow Magical Beasts with Darkvision. We get stat blocks
for both spawn and fully transformed specimens. Both can invade people’s dreams
and use magical black lightning as a weapon, in addition to having very large
and sharp tusks, but the effects of all of these vary per stat block. We’ll see
them from weaker to stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the GM’s option, beasts poison the area around them when they die. The area
within 10 squares of a full beast’s corpse become Defiled Terrain (a hazard
described at the end of the book). Spawn also do this, but the area is only 5
squares in radius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nightmare-beast-spawn&quot;&gt;Nightmare Beast Spawn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, “spawn” is a misleading name. This Large creature was
formerly a more mundane Athasian predator who is currently in the process of
mutating into a nightmare beast. It will kinda resemble the animal it once was,
but is already clearly unnatural. Spawn are Level 16 Elite Artillery with 244
HP. Their ground speed is 8 and they also have Burrow and Climb speeds
of 4. Maybe this was a megapede?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature’s basic melee attack uses its &lt;strong&gt;Tusks&lt;/strong&gt; (Melee 2), which damage and
slide the target 2 squares on a hit. Its favorite tactic, however, is to hang
back and rain &lt;strong&gt;Black Lightning&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 20) upon its foes. This attack
vs. Reflex targets one or two victims. On a hit it deals “lightning and
necrotic” damage, and ongoing 5 necrotic damage (save ends). This worsens to 10
ongoing on the first failed save, and to &lt;em&gt;unconsciousness&lt;/em&gt; (save ends) on the
second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spawn can further torment its unconscious victims with &lt;strong&gt;Horrid Nightmares&lt;/strong&gt;
(minor action, recharge 6+, Ranged 10), which deal psychic damage and prevent
the target from rolling saves for a turn on a hit. Yeah the spawn can
potentially lock a PC down once they’re unconscious from Black Lightning. This
also works if they manage to sneak up on their victims while they sleep, though
the spawn might not yet be clever enough to think of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a target steps into the spawn’s melee reach, it can use its &lt;strong&gt;Barbed Tongue&lt;/strong&gt;
(Melee 3) as a reaction. This attack vs Fortitude deals necrotic damage on a hit
and prevents the target from regaining HP for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nightmare-beast&quot;&gt;Nightmare Beast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fully mutated beast is size Huge, and a Level 25 Solo Controller with 928
HP. In other words, it’s a kaiju. This specimen is stronger than the spawn in
every way, from physical weapons all the way to psychic and magical powers. Its
ground speed is just 6, though, with no other movement modes. It likes to use
its magic to torment its victims, but once it gets injured it will drop the mind
games and get physical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beast has no less than &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; basic attacks, all Melee 3 and each with a
different rider: &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; that slide 3 squares, &lt;strong&gt;Tusks&lt;/strong&gt; that knock prone, and
a &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; that grabs the target if the beast hasn’t grabbed anyone yet. Each of
those of course also does respectable damage. &lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt; lets the beast
pick any two of those to use on the same action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Fury&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+) becomes available while the beast is
bloodied. It lets the creature move its speed and use a claw/claw/tusk/bite
combo at any point along the movement, using up to two attacks against each
target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the beast is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; bloodied, it can instead use its &lt;strong&gt;Black Lightning&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 4+). This version targets 1 or 2 creatures in a Close Burst 5, and on
a hit inflicts ongoing &lt;em&gt;30&lt;/em&gt; lightning and necrotic damage (save ends). Each
creature adjacent to one of the targets takes 20 lightning and necrotic damage
when the target is hit, as well. The targets fall unconscious right on the first
failed saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the beast misses a target while using Black Lightning, it can use its
&lt;strong&gt;Hideous Defiling&lt;/strong&gt; to attack every enemy in a Close Burst 2, dealing a chunk
of necrotic damage on a hit. A hit also allows it to reroll the missed Black
Lightning attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether bloodied or not, the beast can inflict &lt;strong&gt;Horrid Nightmares&lt;/strong&gt; on
unsconscious targets just like its less-developed counterpart, with better
damage. It can also use &lt;strong&gt;Dream Step&lt;/strong&gt; at will, teleporting 15 squares to a
space adjacent to an unconscious creature!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full beasts will usually be found alone, as they kill anything else they can
perceive. A GM who wishes to add more spice to this solo encounter could add
powerful undead minions. The beast might tolerate their presence since they
aren’t living creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spawn could be found in groups, either with each other or still hanging around
their packs as the transformation proceeds. Eventually the day comes when they
complete the transformation and slay their packmates.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Mul</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-mul.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A mul rebel about to bash some slaver&apos;s skull in with a rock.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text for this entry sounds really fucking racist. It can’t decide whether to
talk about muls as if they were non-sapient animals or whether to stick to the
old “stupid and brutal savage” cliches. Therefore, I’ll paraphrase and summarize
it more aggressively than I do most other entries, and also pull stuff from the
much more even-handed text in the Campaign Guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muls are half-dwarves, born from the union of a human and a dwarf. They’re
taller than humans on average, and combine dwarven strength and endurance with
human physical and mental agility. Most muls are born into slavery, as they were
originally a sorcerer-king eugenics project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muls resent slavery just as much as anyone else, and their strong wills and
bodies usually often put them in a position to do something about it. They often
rebel and turn on their oppressors, and you can find communities of free muls
making a life out in the wastes and organizing to strike back at the
sorcerer-kings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their aptitude for resistance, muls are popular as gladiators, which
means a lot of them receive combat training from their enslavers. Most muls the
PCs encounter will have some degree of skill at fighting, and free individuals
often go on to work as mercenaries and bodyguards because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muls are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 6. Their signature
trait is the same &lt;strong&gt;Incredible Toughness&lt;/strong&gt; mul PCs get. Once per encounter, at
the start of their turns, they can automatically end a ongoing damage effect or
the dazed, slowed, stunned, or weakened conditions. This applies both to (save
ends) effects, and to those that would last until the end of the turn, which
makes this ability really useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mul-gladiator&quot;&gt;Mul Gladiator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trained and forced to fight in the arena, the mul gladiator is head and
shoulders above his human rivals both literally and in terms of skill. He’s a
Level 4 Elite Soldier with 112 HP. He wields a &lt;strong&gt;warhammer&lt;/strong&gt; and can use a
&lt;strong&gt;Double Sweep&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver to attack twice in the same action, knocking the
target prone if both attacks hit. If an adjacent prone enemy stands up, the
gladiator can use a &lt;strong&gt;Pursuing Shove&lt;/strong&gt; to attack their Fortitude. On a hit, he
pushes the target 3 squares and shifts 3 squares to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mul-chainfighter&quot;&gt;Mul Chainfighter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could represent a more experienced gladiator or bodyguard, or a free
agent like a mercenary. It’s a Level 8 Brute with 106 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chainfighter wields a &lt;strong&gt;Cahulaks&lt;/strong&gt; as their main weapon. This is a Dark Sun
weapon introduced in the Campaign Guide: a length of chain with barbed
grappling hooks on either end. Its attacks have Reach 2, or Reach 1 if the
chainfighter has a creature grabbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grabs happen via the &lt;strong&gt;Ensnaring Tines&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver, a Reach 2 attack that pulls
the target 1 square and grabs them if they end up adjacent to the mul, who can
grab at most one victim at a time in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the grabbed victim attempts to escape and fails, the chainfighter can use
&lt;strong&gt;Wicked Ensnarement&lt;/strong&gt; (vs. Fortitude) as a reaction. On a hit, this deals a bit
of damage and knocks the target prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mul-savage&quot;&gt;Mul Savage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unfortunately-named stat block is meant to represent a free mul that is
used to surviving in the wastes. It’s a Level 9 Brute with 120 HP and the Leader
tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tag is justified by the &lt;strong&gt;Furious Inspiration&lt;/strong&gt; aura (5) projected by the
mul. Whenever an ally inside the aura becomes bloodied they can make a melee
basic attack as a free action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This warrior fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Bone-Studded Greatclub&lt;/strong&gt;, whose attacks damage and
knock prone on a hit. When first bloodied, his &lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Fury&lt;/strong&gt; lets him make
the same attack against every enemy in a Close Burst 1, additionally pushing
them 2 squares on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mul-champion&quot;&gt;Mul Champion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prominent figure in the rebel movements against the sorcerer-king, champions
inspire others to take up the fight through their deeds. Like the chainfighter,
the champion wields cahulaks, but they’re a lot more skilled with the
weapon. Champions are Level 17 Soldiers with 167 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic &lt;strong&gt;Cahulaks&lt;/strong&gt; attack works exactly like the chainfighter’s, with
better numbers. Their &lt;strong&gt;Snagging Tines&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver is Reach 2 and grabs on a hit,
but it &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; pull: the champion can maintain a grab at up to
Reach 2. &lt;strong&gt;Swinging Hook&lt;/strong&gt; (Encounter) lets them slide a grabbed target 4
squares as an effect, maintaining the grab if the target is within 2 squares of
the champion at the end of the movement. At the end of the movement the champion
makes an attack both against the grabbed target and an enemy adjacent to that
target, damaging and knocking them prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, the &lt;strong&gt;Champion’s Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; marks every enemy in a Close Burst 2
for a turn. If a marked enemy makes an attack that doesn’t target the champion,
they open themselves to a &lt;strong&gt;Wicked Parry&lt;/strong&gt;, a reach 2 interrupt that damages and
inflicts a -2 penalty to the triggering attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book completes its collection of fantasy racism cliches by stating that
neither humans nor dwarves like muls very much. Nevertheless, they can be found
in Mixed Groups of People as bodyguards, enforcers, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked the stat blocks because they’re relatively simple and each has One Neat
Trick. Shame about the fluff, but as you saw it’s relatively easy to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
