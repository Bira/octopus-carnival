  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elementals are a pretty iconic part of D&amp;amp;D, since they’ve shown up on every book
we’ve covered so far. The MM1 and MM2 elementals were built to showcase the
mixed nature of the Elemental Chaos, so they were always a different combination
of two or more elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was pretty cool, but it also caused some edition warriors complain that
they missed the traditional single-element quartet from editions past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Monster Manual 3 brings the “singlementals” back, with heroic, paragon and
epic variants of all four classic types. The Lesser (heroic) variants would be
reprinted in the Monster Vault, and we already covered them &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/02/16/elemental.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll
look at the standards and greaters now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;air-elemental&quot;&gt;Air Elemental&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air Elementals are Lurkers. They have a ground speed of 0, but very high air
speeds with Hover. They also have some degree of vulnerability to Fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lesser Air Elemental is Level 1 and covered &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/02/16/elemental.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;air-elemental-1&quot;&gt;Air Elemental&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Level 10 Lurker has 81 HP and a flight speed of 8. It has the same
&lt;strong&gt;Phantom on the Wind&lt;/strong&gt; trait as the lesser version, which makes it become
invisible when it starts the turn not adjacent to any enemies. This lasts until
the end of its next turn or until it attacks, so it will remain invisible until
it does close in to attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;slam&lt;/strong&gt; with no riders, and it can use a &lt;strong&gt;Rampant
Storm&lt;/strong&gt; that does more damage over a Close Burst 3 area and dazes targets that
couldn’t see the elemental before it attacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classic lurker tactics: start invisible, Rampant Storm, move away to become
invisible again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;greater-air-elemental&quot;&gt;Greater Air Elemental&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is Large and Level 20 with 143 HP and a speed of 10. It has most of the
same traits of the standard air elemental with bigger numbers, and it replaces
Rampant Storm with &lt;strong&gt;Engulfing Winds&lt;/strong&gt;. This melee attack pulls and grabs the
target. The elemental can move freely with a grabbed victim, which takes 20
ongoing damage until they escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one wants to grab someone and play keep-away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;earth-elementals&quot;&gt;Earth Elementals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earth Elementals are Soldiers. They have a burrow speed equal to their walking
speed. &lt;strong&gt;Earth Glide&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to pass through earth and stone as if it had
phasing, and their &lt;strong&gt;Brittle Skin&lt;/strong&gt; means they take a -2 penalty to all defenses
for a turn when hit with thunder damage. They attack with &lt;strong&gt;slams&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the Lesser Air Elemental is covered in the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/02/16/elemental.html&quot;&gt;MM/MV article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard &lt;strong&gt;Earth Elemental&lt;/strong&gt; is level 11 with 119 HP and Speed 7. It gains a
&lt;strong&gt;Quake Stomp&lt;/strong&gt; attack that covers a selective Close Burst 2 and targets
Fortitude, damaging those it hits, sliding them 2 squares, and knocking them
prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Greater Earth Elemental&lt;/strong&gt; is Large, Level 22 with 212 HP, and replaces
Quake Stomp with &lt;strong&gt;Flattening Stomp&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets a single creature for heavy
physical damage and automatically knocks all enemies within 2 squares of the
target prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fire-elementals&quot;&gt;Fire Elementals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire Elementals are skirmishers. They run very fast and can fly, though not as
well as an air elemental. Their &lt;strong&gt;slams&lt;/strong&gt; deal only ongoing fire damage, and
&lt;strong&gt;Flickering Flame&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to shift a number of squares as a minor
action. If they’re hit with cold damage, though, they’re &lt;strong&gt;Frozen in Place&lt;/strong&gt; and
can’t shift for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All elementals have a reaction ability that deals some sort of fire damage
around them when they’re hit by an attack. This gets more powerful as the
elemental gets bigger. Lessers are level 1, standards Level 11, and Greaters
level 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;water-elementals&quot;&gt;Water Elementals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water elementals are controllers. They have a swim speed equal to their ground
speed, and are &lt;strong&gt;Aquatic&lt;/strong&gt;. This gives them attack bonuses against non-aquatic
enemies when fighting underwater. They’re &lt;strong&gt;Sensitive to Cold&lt;/strong&gt;, and after
taking cold damage they gain Vulnerable 5 against the &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; attack to hit them
before the end of their next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;slams&lt;/strong&gt; do some physical damage and inflict ongoing physical damage from
the water that gets into people’s lungs.  &lt;strong&gt;Drowning Essence&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to
slide victims taking this ongoing damage as a minor action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their special attack seems to be surging like a wave, dealing damage and pushing
or sliding people around. It gets more damaging, more frequent, and pushier the
bigger the elemental gets. It has different names for each elemental: &lt;strong&gt;Whelm&lt;/strong&gt;
for Lessers, &lt;strong&gt;Whirlpool&lt;/strong&gt; for standards, and &lt;strong&gt;Surging Waves&lt;/strong&gt; for Greaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess you can notice me getting gradually more bored with classic elementals
as I wrote the above post. These ones are better than they used to be in earlier
editions, but I can understand why the Monster Vault only reprinted the
lessers. The more powerful versions are pretty much the kind of thing you can
write yourself using the standard monster leveling rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all other elementals, they fit easily into any adventure or encounter that
also features someone who could conceivably summon and bind them. They also work
well as “widlife” in the Elemental Chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Drow</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first looked at Drow during our &lt;a href=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2020/02/02/drow.html&quot;&gt;Let’s Read of the Monster Manual and
Vault&lt;/a&gt;, and you can read that post by clicking the link. The basic lore of
the drow remains the same, and this entry adds a bit more alongside some
epic-tier drow enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mainstream Lolth-worshipping drow society is a nightmare of intrigue and
backstabbing, as we have already seen. Every drow is plotting to backstab their
superiors while keeping an eye out for similar plots coming from their
subordinates and peers. The higher they rise, the more favor they have in the
eyes of Lolth. Where does it end, though? What reward awaits those followers who
become such tracherous vermin they become one of Lolth’s favorite children?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why, they get to go live in the Demonweb and do it all over again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abyssal drow make up the bulk of the non-demon population of the Demonweb. The
broad outlines of their society are largely the same as those in the world -
they organize themselves into a number of factions that struggle for dominance
and Lolth’s personal favor. There are three important differences, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that these abyssal factions are centered around powerful and
charismatic individuals rather than around a city-state or noble house. The
second is that they’re made up of a mix of abyssal drows and demons of various
kinds. The third and most surprising difference is that there is almost no
&lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; intrigue within these factions. The stakes in the Abyss are too
high - Abyssal drow form stable alliances because they can’t afford to backstab
their allies down here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leaders of these factions are usually Lolth’s Exarchs, and they occupy the
highest position any mortal worshiper of Lolth can aspire to. When in the Abyss,
they spend their time managing their faction and its intrigues against the
others. When outside the Demonweb, they tend to infiltrate other sapient
cultures or even act as overt ambassadors of Lolth within them. Examples of such
culture includes the giants and efreets of the Elemental Chaos or the devils of
Hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abyssal drow are still drow: Medium Fey Humanoids with a Speed of 7 and
Darkvision. Everything else about them is a function of training and varies per
stat block. Not even the classic Darkfire power is a constant, though it still
shows up in some individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drow-zealot&quot;&gt;Drow Zealot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zealots are terrifying epic level warriors, but among the drow of the Abyss
they’re considered the rank and file, the lowest of the low. Most arrived from
the world not too long ago, their minds filled with dreams of glorious
purpose. Some are instead long-term residents of the Abyss who have been busted
down to zealot from some loftier rank due to some mistake or act of
disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case, the first thing Lolth does to a drow who attains this rank is to
curse them with a demonic spider infestation. The constant pain and suffering
this causes serves as a powerful incentive for zealots to strive for
promotion. The spiders that crawl out of their orifices and wounds also provide
some occasional help in combat, as they attack the drow’s enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zealots are Level 23 Brutes with 265 HP. They have Resist 10 poison and the
usual drow traits. They fight with a Fullblade, a huge two-handed sword that
appeared in one of the Adventurer’s Vault supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While bloodied they project a &lt;strong&gt;Spider Host&lt;/strong&gt; aura (1), which causes any enemy
in the aura that becomes bloodied to take 20 ongoing poison damage (save ends)
as the demon spiders crawl from the zealot’s bloodstream to the enemy’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;fullblades&lt;/strong&gt; do the heavy damage you’d expect from an epic brute, and if
the zealot misses with the attack it gains a +2 to attacks and a +5 to damage
against the same target until the end of its next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zealots have the traditional &lt;strong&gt;Darkfire&lt;/strong&gt; ability, a minor-action encounter
power that targets Reflex. It makes the target grant combat advantage and
nullifies any invisibility or concealment for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the zealot reaches 0 HP, it explodes in a &lt;strong&gt;Spider Burst&lt;/strong&gt;, creating a
Close Burst 1 zone that lasts until the end of the encounter and causes 10
poison damage to anyone that starts their turn inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other zealots are immune to the zone’s damage due to their poison resistance, so
they have no trouble stepping over the ruptured corpses of their allies. They’ll
charge the PCs and hack away without much care for their own wounds, since their
auras kick in when they’re bloodied. They pair well with Leader enemies that
grant extra attacks, since those could allow them to benefit from the damage
bonus given by a missed attack more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;draegloth-abomination&quot;&gt;Draegloth Abomination&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-drow.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abyssal drow often summon, bind, and otherwise ally with demons, but some
priestesses go further and make their own. Draegloths are created by abyssal
magic from a mix of demon and drider DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draegloths are pretty much impossible to control, which isn’t usually a very
desired trait in lab-bred monsters. Because of this their creation is usually
done as an act of devotion to Lolth, and they’re gifted directly to the goddess,
to whom they are quite loyal. They can be found patrolling the Demonweb
alongside other Lolth-favored demons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draegloth Abominations are Huge Elemental Magical Beasts with the Demon
tag. They look like elephant-sized driders, or like the dapper fellow here in
the illustration. They’re Level 24 Lurkers with 174 HP, ground and climb speeds
of 8, Darkvision, and Tremorsense 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; that does double damage against a dazed
creature. The &lt;strong&gt;Slashing Claws&lt;/strong&gt; ability allows them to make two claw attacks
with the same action. Their other attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Tethering Web&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5
vs. Reflex). A hit does a small bit of poison damage and tethers the target
(save ends). Tethered targets are dazed, and the demon can pull them adjacent to
itself with a free action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter they can use a power named &lt;strong&gt;Maddening Darkness&lt;/strong&gt;. This
attacks the Will of all enemies in a Close Burst 2. On a hit, it slows and dazes
for a turn. This power also creates a zone of darkness that blocks line of sight
and blinds those within (with the exception of the demon in both cases). The
zone also lasts for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When damaged, the draegloth can use a &lt;strong&gt;Dark Leap&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction. This is
another encounter power, and it recharges when it’s first bloodied. It allows
the creature to immediately recharge and use Maddening Darkness, and then
teleport 8 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it has top-tier Variable Resistance (Resistance 20 switchable
3/encounter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Draegloths want to strike from ambush and open up with Maddening
Darkness. They’ll claw as many dazed PCs as they can, and use Dark Leap with the
PCs begin counter-attacking. From what point on they’ll try to stay away and
tether the squishies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drow-shadowblade&quot;&gt;Drow Shadowblade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lolth delights in treachery, even between her own followers. So when a drow
assassin is skilled and resourceful enough to murder one of the priestesses that
rule the drow city-states, that assassin gets invited to the Abyss and becomes a
Shadowblade. These epic assassins have access to the best gear, the deadliest
poisons, and to a special technique that lets them animate and control their own
shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadowblades are Level 24 Lurkers with 171 HP and the usual drow
Darkvision. Their ground speed is 7 and they have phasing, which means they can
walk through walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Short Sword&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of attacking, they can spend
their action to cast &lt;strong&gt;Animated Shadow&lt;/strong&gt;, creating an allied animated shadow
within 10 squares. The shadow lasts until the end of the shadowblade’s next
turn and counts as an ally for flanking purposes, but is immune to attacks. When
the shadowblade moves on its turn, the shadow slides an equal number of squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a target is flanked by both the shadowblade and its shadow, the assassin
can use a &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Strike&lt;/strong&gt; that deals the same damage as a basic attack plus 10
necrotic damage. This causes the shadow to burst into a zone of blinding
darkness to which the drow itself is immune. It lasts for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, the shadowblade can poison its weapon with &lt;strong&gt;Soulrot Venom&lt;/strong&gt;,
which adds a complicated rider to the next attack it hits before the end of the
encounter. That hit will weaken the target (save ends). The first failed save
also makes the target take 15 ongoing necrotic damage; the second strips it of
all resistances and immunities! A successful save ends all those effects. The
venom recharges once the shadowblade is first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, its mastery of the sword manifests as the &lt;strong&gt;Persistent Blade&lt;/strong&gt; power
(recharge 4+). This is a free action that triggers when the shadowblade misses
with its sword, and it allows it to make a basic attack against a different
enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shadowblade alpha strike is kinda scary. It summons the shadow and envenoms
its weapon “off-screen”, and then flanks and stabs a PC through a wall. If this
hits, the PC will take damage from the sword, bonus necrotic damage from the
shadow, and will be subject to soulrot venom. If this misses, the shadowblade
can still stab someone else and poison them as a consolation prize. As soon as
it can move again, it will fade into the wall and get ready for another shadow
strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drow-archmage&quot;&gt;Drow Archmage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A drow wizard powerful enough to be invited to live in the Demonweb, where they
give themselves over to the Abyss and become rather warlock-like. Despite their
demonic power, these spellcasters fear for their souls, which become fair game
to their demon buddies if they die. They are quick to run away from a fight if
it seems like they’re losing, abandoning their thralls and allies to their fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archmages are Level 25 Artillery with 178 HP and the standard drow traits. They
fight in melee with &lt;strong&gt;Daggers&lt;/strong&gt; that do physical damage and inflict a -4 attack
penalty for a turn; and at range with &lt;strong&gt;Abyssal Bolts&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 20 vs. Reflex)
that do acid and poison damage. They can also use two encounter spells that
target Fortitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruel Banishing&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 1) does no damage, but teleports the target 7 squares
and dazes them (save ends). This is a lot deadlier if there are draegloths on
Team Monster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demonic Grasp&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10) immobilizes the target and suspends them 1 square
up. Immobilized targets can still fight, they just can’t move. However, while
the target is affected by this spell, they take 10 poison damage every time they
&lt;em&gt;or their allies&lt;/em&gt; damage a demon, drow, or spider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, the archmage can perform an &lt;strong&gt;Unwholesome Sacrifice&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 5+), dealing 20 damage to an adjacent ally in order to either recharge
an encounter power or get a +10 damage bonus to a ranged attack made before the
end of its next turn. Finally, it also has the same &lt;strong&gt;Darkfire&lt;/strong&gt; power as the
zealot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drow-exalted-consort&quot;&gt;Drow Exalted Consort&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drow society is matriarchal, and though plenty of career paths are open to drow
men the loftiest heights of power are usually denied to them. The only way for a
male drow to be part of the real elite is to become consort to a powerful
priestess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a consort is about more than looking pretty - they’re also expected to
serve their ladies as bodyguards and knights. This practice continues in the
Abyss, where Exalted Consorts are hand-picked by Lolth herself for their beauty
and martial skill. She imbues them with divine power, and places them under the
service of her priestesses in the Demonweb. This means Exalted Consorts are
kinda like epic paladins or avengers of Lolth. I guess a gift of new consorts is
a sign that Lolth particularly favors that priestess today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exalted Consorts are Level 25 Skirmishers with 224 HP. They wield paired
&lt;strong&gt;longswords&lt;/strong&gt; in combat with a graceful, mobile fighting style. Aside from
basic attacks, they can use an at-will technique named &lt;strong&gt;Warding Blades&lt;/strong&gt; that
does nearly double the damage of a basic attack and gives them a +6 AC bonus
against opportunity attacks for a turn. This allows them to move around the
battlefield much more freely than most enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have another technique named &lt;strong&gt;Blurred Steel&lt;/strong&gt; that allows them to make
three basic attacks in the same action. Up to two of which can target the same
creature, and the power recharges when the consort moves more than 3 squares in
its turn. This is a good move to alternate with Warding Blades in order to
spread damage around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lolth’s power turns the standard drow Darkfire into an attack named &lt;strong&gt;Darkfire
Revelation&lt;/strong&gt;, a minor action which targets Reflex and deals fire damage. A hit
nullifies invisibility and concealment for a (save ends) duration, longer than
the single turn of basic Darkfire. This is an encounter power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their last encounter power is &lt;strong&gt;Lolth’s Favor&lt;/strong&gt;, which triggers when the consort
becomes bloodied. As a reaction, they teleport 7 squares, and cause all enemies
adjacent to them at the destination to grant combat advantage for a turn. This
is not an escape power, but something used to press the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warding Blades should be the consort’s attack of choice even when it doesn’t
plan on moving much, the extra damage is too good to pass up. Blurring Steel is
a good alternative for when the consort manages to run or teleport past the PC
front line and close in on the poorly-armored squishies at the back, followed by
more Warding Blades in subsequent turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drow-lady-of-spiders&quot;&gt;Drow Lady of Spiders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lady of Spiders” is the second-highest rank in Lolth’s priesthood. There are
only sixty-six of these in all of existence, and the only way to ascend to their
ranks is to kill one of the incumbents. The only drow who outranks them is
Eclavdra, Lolth’s main exarch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Lady of Spiders will always be found commanding a sizable force of drow,
demons and spiders of similar level. Her commands and her magic act as a big
force multiplier for her lackeys. Her powers include a lot of poison- and
mind-based magic, as well as the ability to heal allies and to summon demonic
spiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a Lady is a Level 27 Elite Controller with 494 HP. She projects &lt;strong&gt;Lolth’s
Blessing&lt;/strong&gt; as an aura (2) that heals bloodied allies inside for 10 HP at the
start of their turns. However, she’s &lt;strong&gt;Sensitive to Light&lt;/strong&gt;, which causes the
aura to shut down for a turn if the Lady takes radiant damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her basic melee attack is a &lt;strong&gt;scourge&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and slides enemies 2
squares on a hit, and her basic ranged attack &lt;strong&gt;Conjures Venom&lt;/strong&gt; straight into a
victim’s bloodstream to deal poison damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can also cast an at-will spell to summon &lt;strong&gt;Coccooning Webs&lt;/strong&gt; around a
target, restraining them and dealing ongoing 25 poison damage (save ends
both). I think we just broke the record for most ongoing poison damage in an MM
so far, unless someone else reached 30 and I forgot. A target who makes the save
is still slowed until they pass a second one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lady’s mind magic is represented by &lt;strong&gt;Irrefutable Command&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), a
Close Burst 3 that targets up to 2 creatures in the burst. Targets must choose
between charging another creature of the Lady’s choice or taking 50 psychic
damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d say her signature ability is &lt;strong&gt;Bring Forth the Widows&lt;/strong&gt;, though. It takes a
standard action and summons a Medium demonic shadow spider to a space within 10
squares of the priestess. The Widow has 100 HP and the Lady’s defenses. It also
has speed 8 (spider climb 8), and moves whenever the Lady takes a move
action. It stays in the field for the rest of the fight or until destroyed, and
if it’s destroyed this power recharges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lady can order the Widow to attack with a minor action, and this deals
physical and ongoing poison damage. The spider can also make opportunity attacks
using the Lady’s opportunity action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the lady is hit in melee, her &lt;strong&gt;Fearsome Wrath&lt;/strong&gt; attacks the Will of all
enemies in a close burst 5. On a hit they’re pushed 5 squares and stunned for a
turn. This fear effect recharges once the Lady is first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impression&quot;&gt;Final Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this and the Lolth entry that we’ll find a further into the book
(spoilers!), you have everything you need to run a 4e rendition of the GDQ
module series. Abyssal drow are the sort of enemy you’ll find in the Demonweb
itself, and their unique abilities give you a spicier result than what you’d get
if you just used leveled-up MV drow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to change much of their lore even if non-evil drow are common in
your setting. These are the people who chose to dedicate themselves to Lolth,
goddess of betrayal, mistress of the cycle of abuse, etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common zombies are mindless beasts who fight in a clumsy, instinctual way. Dread
warriors are… still mindless, but the ritual that creates them also imbues
them with more refined combat skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of a dread warrior is to act as a guard and protector. Their
creation binds them to their master, whom they are compelled to protect and
obey. When a dread warrior’s master dies, their reaction is a bit
unpredictable. Some lose their animating force and drop lifelessly to the
ground, others go berserk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of being bound to a person, they can be bound to an item instead,
protecting it from theft and damage even after their creator passes away. Liches
might use this to bind a troop of dread warriors to their soul receptacle, for
example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dread Warriors are Medium Natural Animates with the Undead keyword. They have
low-light vision and a natural speed of 6, modified by armor. They have a
signature traits: &lt;strong&gt;Eyes of Undeath&lt;/strong&gt; allows the warrior’s master to see and
hear anything the creature sees and hears. It also allows the master to speak
through it. There’s no range limit! This makes them excellent emissaries,
decoys, or security “cameras”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual warriors have additional traits related to their training and
intended function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dread-protector&quot;&gt;Dread Protector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your basic security model. Some necromancers like to fill their lairs with these
things so that they always have the reassuring presence of a bodyguard no matter
which room they are in. One does get used to the smell eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dread Protectors are Level 3 Soldiers with 47 HP. They wear heavy armor and
wield greataxes. Their speed is 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from Eyes Undeath, they also have a &lt;strong&gt;Shield of Undeath&lt;/strong&gt; aura (1). If
their master is inside this aura, they only take half damage from melee and
ranged attacks. The protector &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; take the other half of this damage,
making this a very good power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greataxe marks on a hit, and though the protector doesn’t have any other
abilities that make use of the mark it does make it harder to attack the
master. Instead of moving normally they can use &lt;strong&gt;Protector’s Call&lt;/strong&gt; to teleport
their speed to square adjacent to the master. This makes it very hard for PCs to
isolate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dread Protectors will seek to always stay adjacent to their master and keep the
most dangerous melee opponent marked. The best tactic for dealing with them is
to hit them with close or area attacks. These will target both them and their
master, ignoring both the mark penalty and Shield of Undeath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dread-marauder&quot;&gt;Dread Marauder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lightly armored warrior wields a short sword and a bow. It’s not any
smarter than the other dread warriors, but Eyes of Undeath still makes it a
superb scout since the master can see what it sees and order it from afar. If
they die out there, it’s no great loss - the master knows what they need to know
by that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dread Marauders are Level 5 Skirmishers with 53 HP and speed 6. They deal extra
damage when they have &lt;strong&gt;Combat Advantage&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;In the Master’s Defense&lt;/strong&gt;
gives them combat advantage against anyone adjacent to their master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;bow&lt;/strong&gt; give them both melee and ranged basic attacks, and
&lt;strong&gt;Skirmish Strike&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to shift 3 squares before making either one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So aside from being good scouts, dread marauders also serve as good deterrents
against melee PCs, since those PCs will be exposed to stronger attacks from the
marauder as long as they remain adjacent to the master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dread-archers&quot;&gt;Dread Archers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These warriors are meant to act as sniper platforms and fire support for the
master, and to man the ramparts of the master’s fortress. They’re Level 6
Artillery with 57 HP and speed 6. Their gear is similar to the marauder’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As artillery monsters, their &lt;strong&gt;bow&lt;/strong&gt; attack is more accurate than the
&lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt;. Once per encounter they can make an &lt;strong&gt;arcing volley&lt;/strong&gt; area attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their greatest powers are their custom passive trait and reaction, however!
&lt;strong&gt;Channel of Undeath&lt;/strong&gt; allows the master to make implement attacks as if they
occupied the archer’s square, as long as they can see the archer. And when the
master hits with an attack, the archer can use the &lt;strong&gt;Sustained Attack&lt;/strong&gt; reaction
to make an immediate bow attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am unsure whether I’d allow the master to “see” the archer through Eyes of
Undeath, but I’d definitely allow them so see the archer through a telescope!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dread-guardian&quot;&gt;Dread Guardian&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a more powerful version of the dread protector, a Level 7 Soldier with
79 HP. It’s equipped with heavy armor, a shield, a sword, and a bow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the &lt;strong&gt;bow&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt; attacks mark on a hit, and this time the
protector &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make a sword attack as an opportunity action when a marked enemy
attacks the master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Zombie warriors” are almost as classic as “skeleton warriors” in the dungeon
fantasy genre, so I think these are pretty nifty. They’re also awesome
mechanically, because Eyes of Undeath and the other passives allow for a lot if
interesting underhanded tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volcanic dragons were created by Vezzuvu, the Living Mountain. The petitioners
who approached this primordial were &lt;em&gt;angry&lt;/em&gt;. You see, dragons were made in Io’s
image, but Io’s demise proved he was weak. Therefore, these dragons thought,
&lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; were weak, and this realization felt like an insult to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vezzuvu promised that if the dragons bathed in the boiling magma of his domain,
their weak flesh would be burned away and replaced with a truly strong body. His
petitioners obeyed and dove in. The survivors became volcanic dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All was well with the volcanics for a time, but then their old pride and sense
of entitlement began to gnaw at them again. Where their new bodies truly
stronger? Had they been given all the power they were promised, all the power
they surely deserved? When they concluded they hadn’t, they turned on their
former master and went their own way. Their history from this point on is filled
with instances of volcanic dragons allying with servants of either the gods or
the primordials for a time, only to betray them a short time later. In our
narrative present, everyone knows an alliance with these beasts is likely to end
in sudden but inevitable betrayal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical volcanic dragon’s temperament is like that of a red, but worse. They
make a show of craving treasure and rulership over a territory, but what they
truly crave is destruction. In other words, volcanic dragons love burning stuff,
especially flesh. It makes them feel good. They like the company of other
fire-elemental beings with similar dispositions, but any alliance they make is
temporary at best. They live inside volcanoes and on other similar burning
landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Volcanic Dragons follow the same general format of the other catastrophics
you could argue they are right about getting a bad deal from Vezzuvus. They’re
Elemental Magical Beasts with the Dragon and Fire keywords, Darkvision, and a
Clumsy Flight speed equal to their ground speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;volcanic-dragon-wyrmling&quot;&gt;Volcanic Dragon Wyrmling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyrmlings are Medium Level 5 Brutes with 77 HP and Speed 6. They’re surrounded
by an aura (1) of &lt;strong&gt;Noxious Fumes&lt;/strong&gt; that deals 3 poison damage to enemies who
end their turns inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dragon’s basic &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; are weaker than those of most brutes,
but the bite inflicts ongoing fire damage and the claws strip the target of all
fire resistance until the start of the dragon’s next turn. As usual &lt;strong&gt;wyrmling
fury&lt;/strong&gt; allows it to use both attacks in the same action while bloodied. Use the
claw first!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hit by a fire attack, the wyrmling uses a &lt;strong&gt;Sudden Flare&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction,
causing each enemy inside the dragon’s aura to take 5 fire damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;young-volcanic-dragon&quot;&gt;Young Volcanic Dragon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young’uns are Large Level 10 Elite Brutes with 264 HP and speed 8. They have all
the same attacks as the wyrmling, but their Wyrmling Fury upgrades to a full
&lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt;. Their numbers are also bigger, of course, and they gain two
new attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Heat&lt;/strong&gt; is their “disaster” ability. When activated with a minor
action, it makes their Noxious Fumes aura grow to size 3, then to size 5 on the
next turn, and then explode in the turn after that. This explosion targets
Reflex and deals both immediate and ongoing fire damage. After it resolves the
dragon’s aura shrinks to its original size and the power recharges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dragon can also create a &lt;strong&gt;Lava Vent&lt;/strong&gt;, an Area Burst 1 zone that lasts
until the end of the encounter and deals 5 fire damage to anyone who enters or
starts their turn there. This recharges once the dragon is first bloodied, so
each dragon in the fight can create 2 vents total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-age-categories&quot;&gt;Other Age Categories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults&lt;/strong&gt; are Level 15 Elite Brutes with 363 HP, and have all the same
abilities of a young dragon with bigger numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elders&lt;/strong&gt; are Huge Level 20 Elite Brutes with 468 HP, and likewise have all the
same abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancients&lt;/strong&gt; are Huge Level 25 Elite Brutes with 574 HP. They have all the same
abilities as elders and are also able to create a &lt;strong&gt;Fiery Fissure&lt;/strong&gt; in addition
to the lava vents. This works like a temporary wall of fire (and it’s a wall 6
pattern) that deals 20 fire damage to anyone who tries to touch or cross it. It
only lasts for a turn but it’s a minor action and a recharge 5+ attack instead
of an encounter power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Volcanic dragons might be weaker than traditional ones, but they’re much better
at subverting expectations. Typical PCs might see that it’s a fire monster and
load up on fire resistance effects, only to realize the dragon’s aura deals
&lt;em&gt;poison&lt;/em&gt; damage and it can remove fire resistance with its claws. Also, the bulk
of the damage from its basic attacks is untyped, further limiting the usefulness
of fire resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lore-wise, paranoia and entitlement seem to be their strongest personality
traits. They’re hard to deal with because they always feel they’re not getting
their due. Even when a deal is fair and happens as promised, they’ll probably
feel the other party got one over on them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Dragon, Earthquake</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-dragon-earthquake.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earthquake dragons were created by Balcoth, the Groaning King. The petitioners
who approached this Earth primordial were terrified by the death of Io, and were
willing to swear loyalty to anyone who could protect them. Balcoth agreed, and
fulfilled his promise by swallowing the dragons up and keeping them inside his
furnace-like belly, where they “cooked” and were changed by his essence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balcoth would vomit up a few earthquake dragons when he needed their
service. When the primordial was beheaded and slain during the Dawn War, the
rest of his dragons escaped through the wound and into the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, Earthquake dragons are extremely into the whole “living
disaster” thing. When they settle down somewhere, the surrounding region is soon
wracked by tremors of increasing intensity and duration. The dragon feeds on the
people killed by these tremors, and will sometimes destroy a city on purpose
just because they can. They lair in the ruins for months, digesting their prey
and enjoying the view of the ruins until they grow tired of them and fly away to
look for another place to devastate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike their blizzard cousins, earthquakes are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; team players. They’ll form
temporary alliances with inedible creatures (mostly earth-themed), and can
sometimes be bribed into service by mortals, but these arrangements never last
long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dragons aren’t great fliers, but they can swim through earth and rock as
if it was water. They hunt by suppressing their earthquake aura and stalking
their prey from underground. When they attack, they make a spectacular entry and
fight with all of their powers, though they usually retreat back underground
rather than fighting to the death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earthquake Dragons follow the same general plan as Blizzards. They’re Elemental
Magical Beasts with the Dragon and Earth keywords. They have Darkvision,
Tremorsense, and both burrow and clumsy flight speeds that are about half of
their ground speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;earthquake-dragon-wyrmling&quot;&gt;Earthquake Dragon Wyrmling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Medium Level 4 Soldier with 58 HP, representing the youngest dragon
that can be a threat in combat. Their speed is 6 (burrow 2, clumsy flight
2). They project a Quaking Earth aura (1) with a very “soldierly” effect: if an
enemy inside the aura makes an attack that doesn’t include the dragon as a
target, the enemy falls prone and takes 5 damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wyrmling’s &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; basic attacks do physical damage without
riders, and &lt;strong&gt;Wyrmling Fury&lt;/strong&gt; allows it to make both attacks in the same action
while it’s bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, they have a &lt;strong&gt;Sudden Quake&lt;/strong&gt; ability that triggers when they’re knocked
prone or subjected to forced movement. It knocks all enemies inside the dragon’s
aura prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;young-earthquake-dragon&quot;&gt;Young Earthquake Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young dragons are Large Level 9 Elite Soldiers with 206 HP. Their ground speed
increases to 8, their burrow and flight speeds to 4. They have all the same
abilities as a wyrmling, with bigger numbers. They replace Wyrmling Fury with a
proper &lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt; and add two new powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earthen Maw&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 6+) is a melee attack that does more damage than a
basic bite and restains the target (save ends). After the first save the target
is instead petrified! A save still ends this, but the target is entirely unable
to act until they make that save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their “disaster” power is &lt;strong&gt;Rising Tremors&lt;/strong&gt;, which follows the same pattern
seen for blizzard dragons. When it’s activated with a minor action, it increases
the dragon’s aura size to 3. At the end of the next turn, the aura increases
again to 5. And at the end of the turn after that, the dragon makes a Close
Burst 5 attack vs. Reflex. This one deals physical damage, knocks targets prone,
and prevents them from standing back up (save ends). After the attack, the aura
resets and this power recharges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-age-categories&quot;&gt;Other Age Categories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults&lt;/strong&gt; are Level 14 Elite Soldiers with 288 HP, and have all the same
abilities with bigger numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elders&lt;/strong&gt; are Huge Level 19 Elite Soldiers with 374 HP, and again have all the
same abilities with bigger numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancients&lt;/strong&gt; are Level 24 Elite Soldiers with 456 HP, and gain Threatening
Reach 3. They once again have all the same abilities as younger dragons with
bigger numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m surprised the dragons in this entry are still marked as Unaligned despite
being a lot more actively destructive and cruel than blizzard dragons. I’d have
thought “I exist to satisfy my twin urges to destroy and devour” would rate a
Chaotic Evil alignment. Of course, you can go the other way and give them more
flexible personalities and more varied motivations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, earthquake dragons are very good at knocking people down and
&lt;em&gt;keeping&lt;/em&gt; them down, so they pair really well with melee lurkers and skirmishers
whose attacks are more powerful when they have combat advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blizzard Dragons were created by Umboras, Lord of the Rimefire. The dragon
petitioners who approached this primordial were the coldest-hearted among their
number. Umboras took them to the coldest reaches of the Elemental Chaos and
entombed them there for a year and a day while he worked his magic on them. When
they emerged, they were blizzard dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umboras had a specific goal in mind when he did this. He had been an ally of the
winter goddess Khala, who shared with him the goal of freezing the world
solid. However, the Raven Queen had just usurped Khala and claimed the domain of
winter from her, so Umboras was out for revenge. He created blizzard dragons to
help transport his troops to the Raven Queen’s new home of Letherna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Queen, however, was smarter than him. She retreated to the labyrinthine
astral domain of Pandemonium, and used its twisty little passages (all alike) to
separate Umboras from his main forces and lock him in one of the domain’s empty
vaults. He’s still there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blizzard dragons scattered after their master was imprisoned. Some stayed in
Pandemonium, some returned to the Elemental Chaos, some even went to the coldest
places of the world. For obvious reasons, though, you’ll rarely find one of them
in the Shadowfell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blizzard dragons don’t usually have grand plans of their own, and are usually
content to freeze and sculpt their territories. However, they’re surprisingly
good team players and can often be found allied to other creatures of compatible
disposition, helping them achieve their goals. This varies from the usual frost
giants and ice archons to liches or winter fey, depending on the individual. And
they’re always down for breaking a primordial out of prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blizzard dragons are Elemental Magical Beasts with the Cold and Dragon
keywords. They have Darkvision, Ice Walk, and a clumsy flight speed. All of
their attacks do cold damage, even the bites and claws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blizzard-dragon-wyrmling&quot;&gt;Blizzard Dragon Wyrmling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyrmlings are Medium, making them the smallest dragons I’ve seen in my Let’s
Read so far. They’re Level 2 Controllers with 38 HP. They have ground and air
speeds of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that’s right, wyrmlings are &lt;em&gt;regulars&lt;/em&gt;. This means they’ll almost always
be found cooperating with a sizable group of other monsters. The most obvious
candidates are their clutch-siblings, but they’re smart enough to strike an
alliance with lots of other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are surrounded by an aura (1) of &lt;strong&gt;Freezing Wind&lt;/strong&gt;. Enemies that end their
turn inside are slid 1 square. When hit by a cold attack, the wyrmling reacts
with &lt;strong&gt;Sudden Flurry&lt;/strong&gt;, immediately sliding all enemies inside its aura 1
square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; immobilizes, and their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; slide the target 1 square on a
hit. While they’re bloodied, &lt;strong&gt;Wyrmling Fury&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to spend an action to
attack with both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;young-blizzard-dragon&quot;&gt;Young Blizzard Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young’uns grow to size Large, and become Level 7 Elite Controllers with 166
HP. Their speed increases to 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have all of the wyrmling’s abilities with a few differences and
additions. The simplest one is that Wyrmling Flurry is replaced by a standard
Double Attack ability, and their claws slide 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other dragons, blizzards don’t have a breath weapon. Instead, when
they’re hit by a melee attack, a high-pressure blast of frozen liquid bursts
forth from the wound. This is written as a reaction named &lt;strong&gt;Chill Rebuke&lt;/strong&gt;, a
Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude. It deals cold damage and slows on a hit (save
ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also where the “living disaster” mechanic kicks in. Here it’s an ability
named &lt;strong&gt;Rising Winds&lt;/strong&gt;. Once this is activated as a minor action, it causes the
size of the dragon’s Freezing Wind aura to grow to 3. At the start of the
dragon’s next turn, it automatically expands again, to 5. And at the start of
the following turn, the dragon makes a Close Burst 5 attack vs. Fortitude, with
a hit dealing cold damage, slowing, and blinding the targets. Once the attack is
resolved, the aura returns to is initial size of 1 and Rising Winds recharges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adultelder-blizzard-dragon&quot;&gt;Adult/Elder Blizzard Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adults and elders are identical to young’uns, with bigger numbers. Adults are
Level 12 Elite Controllers with 252 HP, and Elders are Level 17 with 338
HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elders are Huge and can move at speed 10. They can slide enemies 3 squares with
their claws and 2 squares with their auras. Their Rising Winds attack restrains
instead of immobilizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ancient-blizzard-dragon&quot;&gt;Ancient Blizzard Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancients are Huge in size, and are Level 22 Elite Controllers with 422
HP. They’re almost idendical to elders, with bigger numbers. They also have a
new encounter power named &lt;strong&gt;Deep Freeze&lt;/strong&gt; that works kinda like a breath weapon,
though I guess it’s more of a high-pressure blood ejection, since the dragon
must be bloodied to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ability attacks enemies in a Close Burst 5, targetting Fortitude. A hit
deals cold damage, immobilizes, and imposes a -5 penalty to Fortitude (save ends
both). A miss deals half damage and imposes the same penalty for a single
turn. All of the dragon’s non-basic attacks target Fortitude, so this penalty
makes it a lot more dangerous while it lasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blizzard dragons feel like they slide into the exact same niche as white
dragons, with a similar cold theme and a similarly unpleasant
personality. Blizzards are smarter and not technically evil, but they still make
for terrible neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, they &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like dragons and like cold themed creatures without
actually using any of the signature mechanics for either! This is a dragon that
does not have a breath attack or a fear aura, and a cold creature that is not
immune to cold. It’s fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Dragon, Catastrophic</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked a lot about dragons, and why I like their 4e implementation, over
the course of these book readings. Sometimes it feels like no big D&amp;amp;D bestiary
is complete without introducing a new dragon subtype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Monster Manual talked about the classic chromatics, which were then updated
on the Monster Vault. You can see what I wrote about them &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Monster Manual 2 talked about the equally classic metallics, and you can
read what I wrote about them &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Monster Manual 3 introduces the much less famous and much newer Catastrophic
Dragons. I believe they are new to 4e, though they might also have shown up in
some late supplement for a previous edition. You might already have noticed I’m
a bit lazy when it comes to researching monster publication histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m sure about is that these are the first 4e dragons that have the
“correct” math from the start. They’re also notable for being generally &lt;em&gt;weaker&lt;/em&gt;
than chromatics and metallics despite the impressive name. Your typical
catastrophic dragon is an Elite monster rather than a Solo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw in previous articles about dragons, when the god Io was split in two
during the Dawn War his followers also split along ideological lines based on
which of the two new deities they preferred: Tiamat the greedy or Bahamut the
just. I imagine the initial decision was easy for most of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most, but not for all. Some of Io’s orphaned followers were gripped by fear
when they saw how easily their lord had been slain, and they decided that the
best way to survive would be to beseech the Primordials for protection and join
their side of the Dawn War. These turncoats were transformed by the “blessings”
of the Primordials into the first catastrophic dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Primordials were defeated most surviving catastrophics scattered across
the multiverse and turned to their own selfish purposes. The typical
catastrophic in the present day is somewhat less formidable than a chromatic,
but more outwardly destructive. They tend to live in extremely hostile
environments that befit their individual natures, and from the point of view of
surrounding civilians their behavior looks a lot like that of a natural
disaster: they occasionally emerge to wreak havoc and destruction on people and
their environment, and then return to their lairs for an unknown amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legends and myths dating back to the Dawn War tell of catastrophic dragons of
immense size and power, capable of sinking continents and destroying entire
astral domains. No one knows whether these stories are true, and even the gods
refuse to tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dragons&quot;&gt;The Dragons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry is structured a lot like previous dragon entries, with each type of
dragon presented getting stat blocks for all of its age categories. That’s about
where it stops, though. Catastrophic dragons are more like personified natural
disasters than like the traditional dragons we saw in previous books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ones we see here are clumsy fliers, and even lack the traditional breath
weapon! Instead, they’re surrounded by an aura that’s like a miniature version
of the disaster they embody. During a fight, this aura grows in size as time
passes and then explodes in a, well, catastrophic manner before returning to its
initial size and beginning the cycle anew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite having bodies largely made up of elemental matter, these dragons lack
any elemental resistances. Instead, damage of their associated type triggers a
reaction ability that punishes the attacker in some form. I would however say
that they are immune to &lt;em&gt;environmental&lt;/em&gt; damage of their associated type even
though that’s not made explicit in their stat blocks, because it just wouldn’t
do for a blizzard dragon to die of frostbite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last major mechanical difference between these dragons and their
predecessors is that catastrophics are Elites instead of Solos. Whether this is
just bad luck or a punishment from the gods, it means that fights against them
will include a bigger supporting cast of other monsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more age categories here than in the previous books: Wyrmling, Young,
Adult, Elder and Ancient. Wyrmlings are Medium in size, and are regular monsters
instead of Elites. Young’uns and Adults are Large, and the last two are Huge. I
guess a wyrmling isn’t quite a “baby dragon”, but I’d still be a bit wary of
placing them as enemies, as I commented earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their thematic link to natural disasters and their destructive demeanor,
catastrophic dragons are typically Unaligned, which says interesting things
about their mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Devil, Vizier</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember seeing these specific devils in earlier editions, but that
might just mean they were from a late 3e book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first silver-tongued manipulative devil we’ve seen, not by far,
but it seems to be the most specialized one. Vizier devils are rarely found in
the Nine Hells - they’re always out in the world serving and tempting ambitious
mortals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all other MM3 devils, the lore text on this one is a bit obsessed with sin
and with the idea that sinners going to hell and becoming devils is a natural
occurrence, which isn’t really something that was present in earlier 4e monster
books. As we saw in previous readings, in 4e Hell is a cosmic aberration. Devils
don’t come from sinners, and they get their souls either by having mortals sign
contracts or through force. Those souls get used as currency, fuel, and magic
item ingredients, not to make new devils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes these creatures members of Hell’s sales department, just like
imps. The main difference is that viziers are stronger, smarter, and bolder in
their suggestions. I imagine having a bound vizier devil instead of a mere bound
imp is a major status symbol among deluded diabolists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re into the sin thing (which was the standard in 3e and maybe earlier),
they you can go with the lore in this entry that says that vizier devils are
genuinely helpful at first but then begin to steer their “masters” down more
evil and sinful paths with the goal of making them go to Hell after they die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer the standard 4e lore, then the main difference is that vizier
devils will try to get their masters to sign a soul contract either as a
pre-condition to their service, or as an “upsell” in exchange for greater power
or greater hellish support at some point after they begin their work as
advisors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 4e-style, contract-based vizier devil is ironically less treacherous than the
temptation-based 3e-style one. Their mortal bosses are likely to &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; be
evil in the first place, so they need little tempting. And after the contract is
signed there is even less need for deception, as the devil already got what it
wanted and only needs to fulfill its part of the bargain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vizier devils look like tieflings with slightly exaggerated fiendish features,
and that actually makes them good at blending in. In combat, they’re
spellcasters with a repertoire focusing on fire and charm magic. They always
have a contingency plan or two to escape if the fight goes against them, and
never fight to the death if they can help it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vizier devils are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils), and Level 7 Controllers
(leaders). They have Resist Fire 10, Darkvision, a ground speed of 6, and a
teleport speed of 4. That’s more or less the same set of traits as a legion
devil, so maybe they’re related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They wield &lt;strong&gt;Scepters&lt;/strong&gt; that work as implements and can be used to bash people
in melee. This does physical damage and slides the target 1 square on a
hit. Their basic ranged attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Helfire Bolt&lt;/strong&gt; that does fire damage and
forces the target to grant combat advantage for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also use a &lt;strong&gt;Word of Command&lt;/strong&gt; at will, which lets them choose a
creature within 2 squares, slide it 3 squares and have it make a free melee
basic attack against another creature of the devil’s choice. The text says “a
creature”, which means this can target either an ally or an enemy with this. And
the thing is an &lt;em&gt;effect&lt;/em&gt;, not an &lt;em&gt;attack&lt;/em&gt;, which means it works
automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word of Command does require a standard action, but it’s still a good choice if
the vizier is accompanied by big bruisers or if the party includes PCs with good
basic attacks. It’s even better if the party includes some of those Essentials
martial classes, since they’re all about having awesome melee basic attacks with
all sorts of special riders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vizier’s leader-ish abilities are &lt;strong&gt;Hellfire Enchantment&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Infernal
Advice&lt;/strong&gt;. The first is a minor action that grants an ally within 5 squares a +5
fire damage bonus to all its melee attacks until the end of its next turn. The
other is a reaction that allows an ally to reroll a missed attack with a +2
bonus. Hellfire Enchantment is an awesome ability to use on allies that have
multiple attacks on their turns! All of them will get the bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not gonna lie, these devils feel a bit redundant. Their concept is exactly
the same as all the other sly manipulators, and the only difference is their
power level. They’re the “level 7 sly manipulator”, where imps are “level 3” an
the others are stronger. I also don’t like the emphasis on sin in this book,
because it’s a 3e-ism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, a vizier devil’s stats make it an interesting monster to fight and
they can easily be reskinned into infernal warlord types. They go really well
with melee bruiser monsters that can make multiple attacks. Those can be part of
the entourage of their mortal bosses, or other devils.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Devil, Swarm</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-devil-swarm.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another devil that breaks the “morphology” guidelines, but it’s kind of
unavoidable this time. After all, they’re associated with Baalzebul, Lord of the
Flies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each swarm devil is a singular mind controlling the bodies of an entire swarm of
acidic fiendish flies. According to the book, they’re formed when an angel is
caught lying to its divine master and is torn apart as punishment. The angel’s
soul falls to the Hells and the bits of its body become flies. They roam the
stagnant pools of Maladomni, the Seventh Hell, eternally starving but unable to
die. They can only leave when their master orders them on a mission, which makes
them very happy because it allows them to fly free and eat people for the
duration. It helps that “eating people” usually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the mission. It’s what
swarm devils do best, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swarm Devils fight by just kinda walking into enemies’ spaces and letting their
flies do the work, and by spewing flies at people they can’t easily reach that
way. As swarms, they’re hard to fight unless you have area-effect weapons and
spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures are Large Immortal Magical Beasts (Devil, Swarm) and Level 18
Skirmishers with 174 HP. They have Darkvision and a flight speed of 10 (hover),
and 20 acid resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have the standard swarm traits on top of that: half damage and
immunity to forced movement from melee and ranged attacks; Vulnerable 10 to
close and area attacks; a swarm aura; the ability to occupy the same space as
other characters; and the ability to squeeze through small openings without
slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Swarm Attack&lt;/strong&gt; aura (1) deals 10 acid damage to enemies caught inside. I
think being in the same space as the swarm also counts as being inside the
aura. Their basic &lt;strong&gt;Slams&lt;/strong&gt; do no immediate damage, and inflict 10 ongoing acid
damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can channel &lt;strong&gt;Acidic Curses&lt;/strong&gt; through their acid, targetting someone taking
ongoing acid damage with a ranged attack that deals psychic damage and inflicts
a -2 penalty to attacks for a turn. Twice per encounter they can &lt;strong&gt;Spew Flies&lt;/strong&gt;
in a Close Burst 3, inflicting ongoing acid damage and forcing targets to grant
combat advantage (save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “just walking into people” tactic is represented by &lt;strong&gt;Swarm Shift&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 5+), in which it shifts its speed and deals 15 acid damage to anyone
they pass through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good tactic for them is to move in, hit a few people with the slam or spew,
use Swarm Shift to move out of the scrum and keep flinging curses at anyone
who’s melting. Reapply the acid as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fly-themed fiends for the Lord of the Flies, nothing unexpected. The
acid/psychic damage mechanic is mildly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Devil, Slime</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-devil-slime.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another one of those monsters that’s all about blurring the lines
between fiends. These monsters are devils, but they break the design rule that
says devils have a human-like appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slime Devils are amorphous oozes, though unlike most “true” oozes they’re
sapient and rather smart. They probably originated in some past edition as well,
because they’re the second devil said to be formed from the souls of dead
sinners (which is not a 4e thing). They arise from the mixture of the toxic mud
in the swamps of Minauros with the hatred that seeps from the souls of corrupt
inquisitors who are stuck there. Their abilities make them adept interrogators
and torturers, since they can read the minds of people they envelop and inflict
intense pain on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re often summoned to act in this capacity by villains in the world, so
they’ll be found alongside those villains’ guards and jailers. In Hell, they
travel with burlier devils, and with those whose controller-y powers can hold
enemies down to be engulfed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Slime Devil is a Medium Immortal Humanoid (Devil, Ooze), and a Level 16 Lurker
with 123 HP. The lore does say their base form is vaguely humanoid, but still
I’d probably classify them as Magical Beasts instead. Either way, it doesn’t
change their other stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have Darkvision, ground and swim speeds of 6, and Resist Acid 20 instead of
the usual devil fire resistance. Their &lt;strong&gt;Mercurial Body&lt;/strong&gt; trait allows them to
ignore difficult terrain and not provoke opportunity attacks when
moving. They’re still vulnerable to a Fighter’s Combat Challenge or other
similar abilities, but non-defenders can’t hold them in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Caustic Slam&lt;/strong&gt; that targets Fortitude and does acid
damage. They can also stretch into &lt;strong&gt;Acidic Tendrils&lt;/strong&gt; that attack up to three
creatures at Reach 3, deal immediate and ongoing acid damage, and pull them 2
squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slime devil’s main trick is &lt;strong&gt;Diabolical Engulfment&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets reflex
and grabs on a hit. Grabbed targets are dazed and take ongoing 10 acid damage
while the grab lasts. The creature occupies the same space as the victim, and
pulls the victim along when it moves. Attacks that hit the slime devil deal half
damage to it and half damage to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action (1/round), the slime devil can use &lt;strong&gt;Scour the Mind&lt;/strong&gt; on its
grabbed victim. This targets Will. On a hit, the devil poses a question to the
victim, who must choose between answering truthfully and taking psychic
damage. The amount of damage is the same as a basic attack, which is a lot for a
minor-action power. The creature can do this and still use its basic attack to
fight off the victim’s friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lore-wise, kinda meh. I’m not a fan of bringing the old “fiends come from the
souls of sinners” cliches back into D&amp;amp;D. They’re more interesting mechanically,
because I love attack powers that force PCs to choose between two bad outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
