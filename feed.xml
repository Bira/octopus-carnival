        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Yuan-ti</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a situation that’s familiar to us by now, Yuan-ti would get a revamp and a
lore infusion in the upcoming Monster Vault (and you can see how that looks like
&lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2021/02/27/yuan-ti.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and this entry presents stat blocks that complement the ones that
would come out in the MV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lore section of this page lacks the nifty creation myth from the MV entry,
sticking to a more generic “perfidious infiltrators” profile for the yuan-ti. It
does add a new bit, however: the snake god Zehir doesn’t just want to see his
favorite people thrive in the world. His true goal is to become the supreme
authority in the cosmos. Zehir is convinced that the universe can only withstand
the return of the primordials if it’s led by the strong hand of a single
absolute ruler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this means we have at least two authoritarian assholes in our current
pantheon: Asmodeus and Zehir. Big Z’s goals are not widely known in the world -
only his most powerful and trusted servants are privy to this mystery. There are
other gods who are aware of this but they’re content to merely keep an eye on
the snake god as long as his machinations continue to hurt their enemies. Things
might get more heated should Zehir explicitly turn against his fellow deities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuan-ti are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Reptile keyword. They have a
ground speed of 7, and 5/tier poison resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the MM1 and Monster Vault gave us heroic and paragon stat blocks for
snaketongue cultists and yuan-ti, the MM3 gives a bunch of high-epic stat blocks
that apparently represent those individuals who are closest to Zehir and
actively working towards his goal of complete world domination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty here for all sorts of all-yuan-ti encounters, but they also
employ various sapient humanoid cultists, and make pets or allies of any
creature who is even remotely similar to a snake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The individual stat blocks are relatively simple, making me think PCs are
supposed to face them in large numbers. It would certainly be possible to
downscale them to lower levels without changing much else about their stat
blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coil-of-zehir&quot;&gt;Coil of Zehir&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Large yuan-ti who’s almost completely snaky, its arms almost vestigial. It’s a
Level 26 Controller with 235 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coil’s basic attack is a Reach 3 &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; that does light physical damage,
pulls the target 2 squares, and grabs it on a hit. The Coil can only have one
victim grabbed at a time, and it can hit them with &lt;strong&gt;Crushing Coils&lt;/strong&gt; for an
automatic 40 damage that also dazes them for a turn. As a minor action, it can
use a Close Burst 3 &lt;strong&gt;Tail Sweep&lt;/strong&gt; that does no damage and knocks targets prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coil wants to grab hold of someone and squeeze them to death, using tail
sweeps to keep would-be rescuers away. Dazed victims can still try to get away
(Athletics DC 38 or Acrobatics DC 39), but their other options are sharply
limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-abomination-berserker&quot;&gt;Yuan-ti Abomination Berserker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abominations are those ‘snakier’ yuan-ti with humanoid torsos but the lower
body of a giant snake. Another Large variant, Berserkers know how to fight and
know they shouldn’t attack other yuan-ti or cultists. That’s about it. The
others treat them nicely to avoid accidents, and then point them at whoever they
want dead. Berserkers are Level 27 Brutes with 293 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures fight with Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;Slams&lt;/strong&gt; that do heavy physical
damage. Every so often they’ll spin and do a &lt;strong&gt;Roundhouse Slam&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+),
making a basic attack against every adjacent enemy. If you hit them while
they’re bloodied, they can make a free slam against you as a reaction. Simple
but effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-malison-guard&quot;&gt;Yuan-ti Malison Guard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malisons are the more humanoid yuan-ti, still covered in scales and with snake
heads, but otherwise humanoid. This is an elite front-line fighter who serves
Zehir proudly despite the shame of having legs. It’s a Level 27 Soldier (Leader)
with 242 HP. It knows how to fight in formation and its &lt;strong&gt;Overlapping Scales&lt;/strong&gt;
aura (1) gives a +2 bonus to AC to all allies inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guards fight with &lt;strong&gt;scimitars&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;longbows&lt;/strong&gt;, both of which deal decent
damage and inflict ongoing poison damage (save ends). The scimitar marks for a
turn on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures want to be in a tight formation with either other melee allies,
or with an artillery detachment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-abomination-spitter&quot;&gt;Yuan-ti Abomination Spitter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An abomination with well-developed venom glands that produce a “blessed” venom
far deadlier than that of a mundane snake. It’s Level 27 Artillery with 186
HP. It can &lt;strong&gt;Spit Venom&lt;/strong&gt; out to Range 20, dealing immediate and ongoing poison
damage on a hit. It can also &lt;strong&gt;Spray Venom&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+) on a close burst 5,
dealing poison damage and dazing (save ends). If someone closes to melee, it can
&lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; to deal physical damage and inflict ongoing poison damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an attack hits the spitter, it can flare its &lt;strong&gt;Cobra Hood&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction to
gain +4 to AC for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-malison-blessed&quot;&gt;Yuan-ti Malison Blessed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An epic priest of Zehir, receiving blessings directly from the deity. It’s a
Level 28 Controller (Leader) with 250 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the blessed’s controllery effects are passive and always on. It projects
an aura (3) of &lt;strong&gt;Zehir’s Favor&lt;/strong&gt; that allows allies inside to reroll failed
recharge rolls. It also projects an aura (5) of &lt;strong&gt;Zehir’s Agony&lt;/strong&gt; that deals 15
poison damage to any enemy starting their turn inside. While bloodied, the
blessed can &lt;strong&gt;Slither Away&lt;/strong&gt;, gaining a +2 bonus to speed and a +5 to all
defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blessed’s active actions are few, but powerful. It fights with a
&lt;strong&gt;scimitar&lt;/strong&gt; whose strikes damage, strip poison resistance, and inflict a -2
penalty to saves vs. poison effects (save ends both). And yes, about 90% of all
attacks described in this MM3 entry are poison effects. Including this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blessed can also use &lt;strong&gt;Zehir’s Command&lt;/strong&gt; as a minor action, allowing two
allies within 5 squares to either make a basic attack or shift their speed as a
free action. If an enemy within 5 squares shifts, the blessed can use &lt;strong&gt;Shifting
Feet&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction to slide them 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these creatures are technically regulars, they have the action efficiency
you’d expect from an elite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-malison-assassin&quot;&gt;Yuan-ti Malison Assassin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-yuan-ti-assassin.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one has a sword and it very much wants to stab you with it so you can
sample the many substances it put on the blade. It’s sent after people who anger
Zehir directly. It’s a Level 28 Lurker with 194 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assassin’s basic &lt;strong&gt;Longsword&lt;/strong&gt; deals very light damage and blinds for a turn
on a hit. A victim who cannot see the assassin for any reason is subject to a
&lt;strong&gt;Death Strike&lt;/strong&gt; that deals standard physical damage, inflicts ongoing 15 poison
damage, and imposes a -2 penalty to saves (save ends both). After the first
failed save, the damage worsens by 5 and the save penalty by 1. Someone also
targetted by the Blessed could be looking at a total -5 save penalty here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a ranged or melee attack hits the assassin it can use &lt;strong&gt;Shield of Zehir&lt;/strong&gt; to
make sure a blind victim adjacent to it also suffers the attack’s damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-malison-stalker&quot;&gt;Yuan-ti Malison Stalker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relentless pursuer sent after victims who steal from Zehir’s temples or commit
other crimes against the yuan-ti people. They’re Level 28 Skirmishers wtih 254
HP. They’re more or less equivalen to PC avengers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalkers use &lt;strong&gt;greataxes&lt;/strong&gt; and have 5e advantage on their attacks if the target
is the only creature adjacent to them. They can also teleport 3 squares as a
minor action, which means they can move up to 13 squares a turn without spending
their standard action, and they can charge someone from 20 squares away. It’s
impossible to outrun a stalker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;molt-of-zehir&quot;&gt;Molt of Zehir&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally a person-shaped bag of snakes, made from the cast-off skin of a
yuan-ti. This apparently &lt;em&gt;just happens&lt;/em&gt; when an epic yuan-ti molts, it’s not a
conscious ritual or anything. The snakes just appear from somewhere and crawl
inside the skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molts are Level 26 Minion Skirmishers. They have a basic &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; attack and
when they die the dispersing &lt;strong&gt;Horde of Snakes&lt;/strong&gt; acts as a Close Burst 1 attack
that damages and inflicts ongoing poison damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not overly fond of classic yuan-ti lore these days, because it has too
strong a whiff of “yellow peril” about it. I’d probably come up with something
different for them if I had to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, these creatures are kind of interesting, though each one is very
simple. Mechanically, I think you can knock 10 or even 20 levels off them if you
don’t want your PCs to wait until the campaign’s endgame to fight the snek
people.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shadowrun: Goncharov</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently read about a fun Tumblr meme. It’s about Goncharov, a 1973 Martin
Scorcese movie that never existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It began when someone posted a picture of these bootleg boots they bought
somewhere. The brand label had one of those word salads copied from somewhere
and edited by someone not too familiar with the target language. In this case,
it was copied from a poster for Gomorrah, a real movie. And it read “Martin
Scorcese presents Goncharov”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tumblr &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/hussyknee/701454778540146688/im-so-confused-rn-can-you-explain-the-goncharov&quot;&gt;kinda ran with it&lt;/a&gt;, so now you have a lot of people making things up about
the movie and fabricating screenshots, posters, bits of soundtrack, talking
about all of this as if it was a real cinematic masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone in a Discord server I frequent suggested Goncharov should become a
standard name for someone who doesn’t exist, the opposite of John Doe. And this
got me thinking about Shadowrun again. Here are two uses for the name Goncharov
in a Shadowrun-like setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mundane&quot;&gt;The Mundane&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Shadowrun, “Mr. Johnson” is shadowrunner slang for a person who hires
shadowrunners. The stereotypical Mr. Johnson is a shady fuck in a suit who talks
in vague businesslike terms&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but it can be anyone who is willing to be the
“client” for a runner group. That’s an established part of the game already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how about we say Goncharov is the “reverse” term? Goncharov is Johnson code
for shadowrunners! Sure “shadowrunners” is canon and also works well, but you
can’t really write “shadowrunner payoff” in your official corporate ledger, can
you? So instead you write “payment to Goncharov for services rendered”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like no self-respecting mysterious client calls themselves Mr. Johnson,
no self-respecting runner calls themselves Goncharov. Someone who takes that as
their handle or even as an alias is telling the whole world they’re a clueless
poser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This little bit of culture works well in the Shadowrun setting itself, and on
any other setting that has stylish urban mercenaries as characters, including a
lot of GURPS Action or GURPS Cyberpunk campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numinous&quot;&gt;The Numinous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go a bit further, shall we? Here’s a mystical explanation that’s a bit
more mystical than even Shadowrun’s default setting allows for&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and is a bit
closer to Exalted’s take on spirits and magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goncharov is the Small God of Shadowrunners. He started out as an abstraction,
as above, but at some point became a real part of shadowrunning culture. Either
an existing spirit took on the mantle, or folk belief made him real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real&lt;/em&gt; runners, those who are more than amoral assholes doing horrible things
for money, they have an understanding with Goncharov. They never forget the
corps and the big syndicates are the enemy even when circumstances force them to
work for these groups. They never sell out. They know who their community and
friends are, and they look out for them. And after every successful job, they
give Goncharov his cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goncharov looks like a fit but somewhat scuffed up man in a nice but somewhat
scuffed up suit. The details vary, but he never looks overly fancy or
arrogant. In other words, he might look like John Wick after a fight or three,
but never like the Continental Hotel guy - that’s the god of Mr. Johnsons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magicians can take Goncharov as a mentor spirit. He provides bonuses to combat
spells and Spirits of Man, whatever form those bonuses take in your edition of
choice. Non-magicians can also have “an understanding” with him for a slightly
cheaper price. This gives them access to the Goncharov’s Cut rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;goncharovs-cut&quot;&gt;Goncharov’s Cut&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who have an understanding with the god of Shadowrunners, and keep to his
code, can gain extra Karma for giving him his cut. This includes magicians who
take him as a mentor spirit, or any character who spends points to buy a
slightly cheaper Edge representing the covenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re using the Karma for Cash rule in your game, such characters gain an
extra point of Karma when using the rule, if they would already gain at least
one point normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that’s not a general campaign rule, such characters still gain access to it,
becoming able to exchange money for a single point of Karma after every run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases the money goes to support and improve the runner’s community, or
to help out fellow shadowrunners in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-gurps&quot;&gt;In GURPS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a GURPS Action or Cyberpunk campaign with supernatural elements, The
Understanding is a -10-point Code of Honor, since it’s informal but applies to
interactions with people who are not your peers. Give Goncharov his cut and use
it to support your community and fellow runners; hunt down and punish any who
betray them&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; never sell out; even if you need to do a job for a corp or a
crime syndicate, never forget they’re the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This code can work as a “pact” limitation for supernatural or cinematic traits
related to being stealthy, discreet, or good at combat (yes, even Gunslinger or
a talent like Smooth Operator). It would provide a 10% discount on their price,
as normal, and would make these abilities unavailable until atonement if the PC
breaks the attached code. Goncharov’s cut is also 10%. Following the code might
also lead to acquiring traits such as positive reputation among your community
or fellow runners, or Enemies in the form of traitorous villains and amoral
mercenaries who think you’re weak for having a conscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And who betrays you at the end. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Though I understand it was kinda moving in this direction in its latest
editions. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Yes, you are totally following the code if you track Clockwork down and
shoot him in the head after telling him “Goncharov says hi”. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:3&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Yeti</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-yeti.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yetis are inspired by real world folklore and I’m sure they showed up in a
previous edition of D&amp;amp;D before. This seems to be their 4e debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D&amp;amp;D yeti are borderline-sapient predators adapted to live in permafrost covered
mountains. While they usually feed on other mountain-dwelling animals, they’re
more than powerful and ferocious enough to attack people, and so everyone who
lives near their habitat knows they exist. Learning how to recognize signs of
yeti presence and avoid the creatures is probably a standard part of mountain
survival training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yetis have a well-developed sense of smell and can track prey across great
distances. They hate the smell of rotting flesh, however, so leaving decomposed
animal carcasses around an area can serve to keep them away. Herders also know
to pay attention to their animals: if they grow too agitated for no apparent
reason, it might be because they’ve sensed an approaching yeti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A yeti relies on its powerful muscles, sharp claws, and magic-enhanced howls to
kill its prey. They don’t really have any sort of technology or a complex
society, but they live in bands and work very well together. They’re smart
enough to avoid large, well-armed expeditions, but they’ll be on top of any
isolated stragglers before you can say “Look out, a yeti!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeti are Medium Natural Beasts with Speed 6, Ice Walk, Resist 5 Cold and
Low-Light Vision. Their signature encounter power is their &lt;strong&gt;Fearsome Howl&lt;/strong&gt;, a
Close Blast 4 vs. Will that deals psychic damage and pushes 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the entries here have &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; as their basic attacks. These don’t have
any riders and are always underpowered for their level, which means they’ll use
their other attacks as much as possible. Their other attacks also tend to have
low-ish damage, but have interesting riders. They have an Int between 9 and 11
while still counting as Beasts, which is why I said “borderline sapient” above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeti encounters will most often be against an all-yeti group, as they don’t
really ally with anyone or keep pets. For variety, you can add other
opportunistic predators, or maybe a wild cold elemental or two. Also, these
encounters are all pretty much guaranteed to take place in treacherous frozen
mountain paths full of ice-based difficult terrain and hazards like tall cliffs
and snow-covered sinkholes. Every yeti has at least one forced-movement power
available to it (Fearsome Howl), so they’re likely to be more dangerous than
their stats alone indicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yeti-hunter&quot;&gt;Yeti Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your typical roaming yeti, whose howls can be heard from miles away but don’t
really give away their position because of the way sound echoes in the
mountains. It’s a level 3 Soldier with 49 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hunter’s claw attack will probably only feature as part of a &lt;strong&gt;Twin Claw
Grab&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets it make two attacks and grab the target if both hit. It
doesn’t have any special abilities to exploit a grab, but the basic rules still
apply. Its marking abilities are a ranged &lt;strong&gt;How of Challenge&lt;/strong&gt; that deals
psychic damage and marks for a turn, and a close burst &lt;strong&gt;Call for Blood&lt;/strong&gt; that
deals more psychic damage and marks everyone it hits (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yeti-howler&quot;&gt;Yeti Howler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A yeti whose magic howls are more powerful than usual. Some stories say they’re
the embodiment of angry ghosts, howling against the injustice of their premature
deaths. They’re Level 4 Controllers with 58 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The howler’s &lt;strong&gt;Chilling Wail&lt;/strong&gt; acts as an aura (3) that deals 5 psychic damage
and imposes a -2 defense penalty for a turn against any enemy who ends their
turn inside. This actually brings its melee damage up to par, with a little
extra aimed at the other PCs inside the aura. If you try to stay away from it,
the howler will bombard you with &lt;strong&gt;Hurled Boulders&lt;/strong&gt; that work like ranged area
attacks dealing physical damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to their Fearsome Howl, howlers can also emit a &lt;strong&gt;Piercing Shriek&lt;/strong&gt;
once per encounter. This ranged attack deals thunder damage, and if the target
ends their next turn within 5 squares of the yeti they take another 5 thunder
damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yeti-rampager&quot;&gt;Yeti Rampager&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is angrier than usual, with a more mobile fighting style. It’s a Level
5 Skirmisher with 67 HP. They have a Speed of 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rampagers love to charge, so they’ll try to make space for those charges as
often as possible. They’ll pick a target and use their &lt;strong&gt;Battle Howl&lt;/strong&gt; against
it, a ranged attack that deals psychic damage and lets them charge as a free
action on a hit. They can also just charge normally instead, if they’re not
confident of hitting the target with the howl. In either case their &lt;strong&gt;Furious
Charger&lt;/strong&gt; trait gives them +5 bonus damage on charges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they’re surrounded by melee PCs, howlers can use Furious Howl or &lt;strong&gt;Trample&lt;/strong&gt;
to get away. That last ability lets them shift their speed and make a melee
attack that damages and knocks prone on a hit against any enemies whose spaces
they move through during the shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeti are interesting mechanically, but they require a bit more thought on the
part of the GM to ensure they’re dealing level appropriate damage. None of them
are the type to stand still and spam basic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lore-wise, I don’t see much wrong with their lore. They’re described as
dangerous predators, and the word “savage” doesn’t appear even once in this
entry. The biggest criticism I can make is that yetis are so iconic outside D&amp;amp;D
that facing one feels kinda “mundane” when compared to some of the other
monsters available. That’s just a personal taste thing, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wouldn’t be hard to use these stat blocks for a sapient and friendlier yeti
if that’s how you want them to be in your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure xivorts appeared in a previous edition, but here they get some new
4e-specific lore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xivorts are a tragic threat. They are descended from gnomes enslaved by
fomorians and subjected to all sorts of tortures and experiments. Their long
captivity in the Feydark caused them to mutate into their present cave-adapted
state, which was further exacerbated when most of them were freed from their
captors by a cabal of night hags and brought to the Shadowfell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hags were only interested in liberating the xivorts as a way to deal a blow
to their fomorian masters, so they just left the former gnomes to their own
devices in the Shadowfell. These newly freed xivorts had only known torment and
suffering all their lives, so they set about dealing that to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual I’m not fond of painting a whole sapient species with such a broad
negative brush, so I want to say xivorts are just people and you can find whole
communities of non-evil individuals out there. The ones you end up fighting
might still fit the description here, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For good or ill, xivorts tend to associate with dark ones and gnomes. They have
a particular distrust of larger people, an echo of the hatred they hold for
fomorians. Goliaths and half-orcs tend to be priority targets in combat
encounters because of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xivorts are Small Fey Humanoids with a Speed of 5 and Darkvison. Their signature
ability is &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Step&lt;/strong&gt;, which triggers whenever an adjacent enemy hits
them. It allows the xivort to teleport 2 squares to another space adjacent to
the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the entries here are level 1 or 2, which makes me think they’re meant to
be novel kobold and goblin replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xivort-slasher&quot;&gt;Xivort Slasher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a “slasher” in the horror movie sense. It fights because it likes to
inflict pain. As a Level 1 Skirmisher with 26 HP, it’s not a big threat to a
trained adventurer, but from the point of view of a non-combatant it could look
like an unstoppable killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slasher fights with a &lt;strong&gt;short sword&lt;/strong&gt; in melee and throws &lt;strong&gt;daggers&lt;/strong&gt; at
range. Besides the standard Shadow Step it has &lt;strong&gt;Cunning Step&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows it
to shift 1 square when an enemy adjacent to it is hit by an attack. This doesn’t
have to be one of the slasher’s own attacks, it can be anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If several slashers gang up on a single enemy, that enemy will soon find
themselves surrounded by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xivort-darter&quot;&gt;Xivort Darter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one fights using concealable thrown darts, a tradition dating back to the
xivort’s time as Fomorian captives. It’s Level 1 Artillery with 22 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the xivort’s &lt;strong&gt;Dagger&lt;/strong&gt; and its &lt;strong&gt;Darts&lt;/strong&gt; are a bit weak, but it can use
&lt;strong&gt;Dart Volley&lt;/strong&gt; to make two ranged attacks in the same action. Once per
encounter it can throw its special &lt;strong&gt;Dream Venom Dart&lt;/strong&gt;, which does the same
damage as a basic one and dazes (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the darter’s ranged attacks target &lt;em&gt;Reflex&lt;/em&gt;, not AC, making it
particularly effective against heavily armored defenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the usual Shadow Step, the darter has &lt;strong&gt;Darter’s Step&lt;/strong&gt;, which
works the same but doesn’t restrict its teleport destination. It’s meant to let
them get away from melee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xivort-net-caster&quot;&gt;Xivort Net Caster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is trained to bring larger foes down so they’re easier to kill. It’s a
Level 1 Controller with 26 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net caster can use a non-damaging &lt;strong&gt;net&lt;/strong&gt; as a ranged area attack to
restrain everyone it hits (save ends). If someone escapes the net it can throw a
pair of non-damaging &lt;strong&gt;bolas&lt;/strong&gt; as a minor action to knock them prone and prevent
them from getting up for a turn. Then it moves in with its &lt;strong&gt;short sword&lt;/strong&gt;,
which deals bonus damage against prone, immobilized, restrained or sloweed
enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the status effects the net caster inflict make the target grant combat
advantage, so they go really well with monsters that can exploit that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xivort-shadow-caller&quot;&gt;Xivort Shadow Caller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spellcaster using the ‘mysteeeerious’ Shadow source, who apparently traded
part of their soul to the Shadowfell itself in exchange for power. It’s Level 2
Artillery with the Leader keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow callers user &lt;strong&gt;daggers&lt;/strong&gt; in melee, but like most artillery they want to
stay further away and use their ranged spells. &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Phantoms&lt;/strong&gt; is their
basic ranged attack, dealing psychic damage and making the target grant combat
advantage for a turn. This has an extra +1 to hit for every creature adjacent to
the target, be it ally or enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deathmark Bolt&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) deals necrotic damage and lets an ally of the
caster make a free melee basic attack against the target. And &lt;strong&gt;Shadow
Strangler&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) is a “pseudo-summon” that immobilizes and inflicts
ongoing 5 necrotic damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as low-level enemies go, they’re… okay I guess? Fighting these guys
instead of kobolds is a nice change of pace, but I’ll confess I lose a bit of
enthusiasm for them when I realize they’re another attempt to hype up the Shadow
power source.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Wilden</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-wilden.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe wilden are new to 4e, first appearing in the Player’s Handbook 3 as an
option for PCs. This is their corresponding Monster Manual entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilden are the middle world’s immune response to the Far Realm. They appeared
very recently, emerging from the Feywild’s deepest and most untouched natural
environments. Theoretically, that’s a reaction to an upsurge in Far Realm
activity in the world, and it’s worrying that the signs of that haven’t been
noticed by anyone else yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even the wilden themselves have a clear idea of what caused them to
emerge. The setting’s youngest sapient people by far, they have an instinctual
drive to protect nature and oppose aberrant creatures, but they have yet to form
a unified culture and traditions of their own. Most individuals turn to other
creatures around them for examples. For many, those come from more established
fey peoples like elves, eladrin, and gnomes. Others turn to the beasts of the
wild, or to more zealous spirits like dryads and treants, and end up much
fiercer and much less sociable. Some even fall in with evil fey like fomorians,
ending up as villainous as them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilden are Medium Fey Humanoids with a speed of 6 and low-light vision. As PCs,
their gimmick is that they may assume one of three &lt;em&gt;aspects&lt;/em&gt; after an extended
rest, each of which changes their appearance a bit and gives them a different
racial power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the three stat blocks in this entry belongs to a single aspect and
carries that aspect’s related power, in a version stronger than what’s available
to PCs. They’re Unaligned and may represent allies, neutrals, or hostiles as
your story requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re all in the low-heroic range, which means you can find NPC wilden in the
same areas where you’d find NPC elves and gnomes. They often use wolves, spiders
and drakes as pets, and there are many such creatures that would be
level-appropriate for a wilden encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wilden-destroyer&quot;&gt;Wilden Destroyer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wildens who adopt the aspect of the Destroyer are usually the designated
warriors of their communities. They wield large carved wooden clubs, and every
time they survive a battle they add a new carving to their weapons to celebrate
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Destroyers are Level 2 Soldiers with 39 HP. Their carved &lt;strong&gt;greatclubs&lt;/strong&gt; damage
and mark for a turn on a hit, and they can throw &lt;strong&gt;handaxes&lt;/strong&gt; as basic ranged
attacks. If an enemy marked by the destroyer tries to ignore the mark, the
destroyer gains a +4 bonus to attack and damage that enemy during their next
turn. If a bloodied enemy attacks the destroyer or one of the destroyer’s
adjacent allies, it can use the &lt;strong&gt;Wrath of the Destroyer&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power to
attack that enemy as a reaction. If this hits, the enemy becomes stunned for a
turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PC Wildens in Destroyer aspect can use that power too, though for them it dazes
instead of stunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wilden-hunter&quot;&gt;Wilden Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilden who adopt the Hunter aspect fulfill that role in their community, and
also make for excellent scouts. They are Level 2 Lurkers with 33 HP. They fight
with &lt;strong&gt;shortswords&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;longbows&lt;/strong&gt; that just make basic attacks. All their
interesting stuff is in their passive traits and their racial power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The passives are familiar to us by now: &lt;strong&gt;Camouflage&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to make
Stealth checks with only partial cover and concealment; &lt;strong&gt;Sniper&lt;/strong&gt; lets them
stay hidden when they miss with a ranged attack from hiding; and &lt;strong&gt;Hidden Shot&lt;/strong&gt;
lets them deal extra damage when they attack from hiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their encounter power is &lt;strong&gt;Pursuit of the Hunter&lt;/strong&gt;, which triggers when an enemy
ends their movement within 2 squares of the hunter. The hunter can react by
shifting 3 squares, and for their next turn they will deal 5 extra damage with
their attacks against that enemy, and will also ignore partial cover and
concealment against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PC Wilden in the Hunter aspect get a similar Pursuit power, except it deals 1d6
extra damage instead of the fixed 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wilden-ancient&quot;&gt;Wilden Ancient&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilden who adopt the aspect of the Ancients are their community’s shamans and
guides. They’re called “Ancients” because their magic lets them cast their minds
to the collective history of the Feywild and the world. When they go into these
trances, their whole community stops to take care of them and await their
awakening, which might bring important insights or prophecies with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ancient depicted here is Level 4 Artillery with 45 HP and the Leader
tag. It’s a primal spellcaster who fights with a &lt;strong&gt;spear&lt;/strong&gt; and with several
combat spells. Their spear attacks are very weak but allow an ally adjacent to
the target to make a free melee basic attack at +4 to hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their combat spells have varied effects: &lt;strong&gt;Spectral Vine&lt;/strong&gt; is a basic ranged
attack that deals physical damage and pulls 2 squares; &lt;strong&gt;Rumbling Earth&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 5+) is a ranged area attack that damages and immobilizes (save ends);
and &lt;strong&gt;Lightning Storm&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) is a ranged area attack that does heavy
lightning damage, half on a miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per round as a minor action they can impart the &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom of the Ancients&lt;/strong&gt;,
granting them a +2 attack bonus for their next turn. And then they hit an enemy
with an area attack, they can use their &lt;strong&gt;Voyage of the Ancients&lt;/strong&gt; encounter
power to teleport 3 squares and make one of the enemies they just hit grant
combat advantage for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their many controllery effects, it makes sense for Ancients to be
artillery. They want to stay safe behind a wall of bodyguards and bombard their
enemies, not mix it up in melee like a controller might want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gotta say it feels a bit odd to find a low-heroic entry right after the
high-epic Weavers, but that’s just a product of the book being in alphabetic
order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wildens are serviceable enough as low-heroic enemies, about in line with what I
expect from an entry dedicated to a creature that’s also a PC option.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Weaver</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-weaver.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weavers have apparently been around since the days of AD&amp;amp;D, appearing in a
Monstrous Compendium Annual there under the name “Spell Weavers”. Their 4e debut
was actually in Dungeon #165, in the adventure titled “Secrets of the White
Lotus Academy”. Here in the MM3 they get updated into a major cosmic threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, it was in a weaver ruin that Kyuss found the writings that let him
become the Worm that Walks, back in the 3e adventure path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weaver civilization is incredibly ancient, and what little remains of it seems
to have been somehow shattered and spread across the cosmos. Records recovered
from these few ruins seem to describe a terrible Far Realm incursion that tried
to inject a seed of chaos into our cosmos. The Weavers tried to stop this, and
were only partially successful. This is what shattered them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hear the Weavers themselves tell it, their civilization predated even the
gods and primordials, and the event that caused its destruction was in fact what
caused the universe to separate into the Elemental Chaos and the Astral
Sea. Contemporary sages don’t believe this to be true, but the surviving Weavers
certainly do. This belief is at the root of their disdain for all things
divine. To them, the gods are just annoying upstarts. Their own bodies and minds
are the product of aeons of transhuman enhancement. They’re much stronger,
faster, and smarter than your average mortal, and possess an unparalleled
multitasking ability that lets them even cast multiple complex spells at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present-day Weavers preserve as much of their ancient lore as they can, and work
on a grand plan to rebuild their civilization by undoing the planar disjunction
that broke it. Yes, they want to smush the planes back together. If they’re
right, it will be a very bad time for everyone else in the universe. If they’re
wrong, it will be a bad time for absolutely everyone, including themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their plan has two parts. The first is to restore and repair as many weaver
ruins as possible. Within each one is a planar portal that links all active
ruins into a single network, and a mystical furnace that burns the life force of
mortals and the enchantments that power magic items. By feeding these furnaces,
weavers gather power for the series of rituals that will finally accomplish
their goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weaver will be most likely be found masterminding some plan to gather powerful
mortal souls and magic items. They drain this power through enchanted chromatic
disks that only work for weavers. Every individual carries one of these, though
they specialize in different “flavors” of soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weavers easily form alliances with other powerful groups that have the same
negative opinion of the gods and a nihilistic bent, like tulgars and the
Forsaken. They also hold great influence over the Nerra, leading some scholars
to say the creation story in that entry is wrong and the Nerra are actually
creations of the Weavers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weavers are Medium Immortal Humanoids. They have Darkvision, a ground speed of
6, and a teleport speed of 6. Their signature trait is &lt;strong&gt;Multitasking Brain&lt;/strong&gt;,
which limits the effect of the dazed condition on them: they only lose their
move action, and can still take immediate actions (like interrupts and
reactions).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other signature trait is more of a design directive: most of a weaver’s
attacks are minor actions, and they’re about as effective as a standard action
from another monster would be. They’re also all Elites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each weaver statted below specializes in collecting the souls of characters who
employ a different power source, using that same power source as its main
weapon. There’s one for every power source except divine, whom they consider
beneath them even as fuel for their furnaces. Ironically, this means divine
characters have a bit of an advantage over weavers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spell-weaver&quot;&gt;Spell Weaver&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic model, concerned with the collection of arcane power. Spell weavers
usually lead raids into secure locations in order to steal magic itens and
particularly desirable souls. They’re planned months in advance with intel from
spies and divinations, and usually involve the opening of a long-distance portal
as close to the target as possible. Once the spell weaver has what it wants, it
teleports back to the portal and escapes. It’s Level 28 Elite Artillery with 400
HP. Yes, according to this entry the typical weaver is equivalent to a demigod
in power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have three basic attacks, all doable as minor actions: &lt;strong&gt;Esoteric Touch&lt;/strong&gt;
deals force damage and pushes 5 squares; &lt;strong&gt;Dimensional Ray&lt;/strong&gt; allows the weaver
to teleport 2 squares before rolling, deals untyped damage, and teleports the
target 2 squares; and &lt;strong&gt;Esoteric Blast&lt;/strong&gt; deals fire damage to its target and an
automatic 10 fire damage to all enemies adjacent to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also as a minor action, it can wield its chromatic disk and cast &lt;strong&gt;Extract
Arcane Soul&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+). This can only target characters with arcane
powers. It deals psychic damage and dazes (save ends). On a miss it deals half
damage. Hit or miss, the weaver regains 20 HP. So this doesn’t extract your
whole soul, just a bit of your life force. It’s still bad news!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have a standard action attack: &lt;strong&gt;Chilling Echo&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to
automatically deal 15 cold damage to all creatures the spell weaver has damaged
since the start of its current turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter, when the weaver takes damage, it can use &lt;strong&gt;Defensive Jaunt&lt;/strong&gt;
as a reaction, becoming invisible and teleporting 20 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spell weaver’s minor action attacks deal about half the damage you would
expect from the MM3 formula, but the addition of Chilling Echo brings them back
up to their expected potential. Don’t forget to use it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;battleweaver&quot;&gt;Battleweaver&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibly some of the best warriors in the universe, battleweavers wield 4
exquisitely-crafted swords in combat, and hold their chromatic disk in their
other two hands. They collect the life force of worthy warriors. Battleweavers
are Level 26 Elite Soldiers with 488 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s imposssible to duel a battleweaver and come out unscathed, because their
&lt;strong&gt;Blade Mastery&lt;/strong&gt; acts as an aura (1) that deals 10 automatic damage to any
enemies inside and marks them for a turn when this happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a standard &lt;strong&gt;longsword&lt;/strong&gt; basic attack, but they’re usually going to
open with one of their two minor-action maneuvers, which also count as basic
attacks. &lt;strong&gt;Quick Jab&lt;/strong&gt; deals light physical damage and slides the target 3
squares to a space adjacent to the weaver; &lt;strong&gt;sidestep jab&lt;/strong&gt; does the same damage
and allows the weaver to shift 3 squares to a space adjacent to the
target. Combined, they allow the creature to lead its foes on a merry dance
across the field. The basic attack can then act as a “finisher” in the round,
bringing their damage potential to a level a bit above the one expected by the
formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battleweavers can use their chromatic disk to &lt;strong&gt;Extract a Martial Soul&lt;/strong&gt;,
targetting characters with martial powers. This is like the spellweaver’s
version: it deals psychic damage, dazes (save ends), and heals the weaver for
about 5% of its total HP (24 in this case).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an enemy marked by the battleweaver within 10 squares makes an attack that
doesn’t include the weaver as a target, the weaver can teleport to the enemy and
make a melee basic attack against it, as an interrupt. This is the other main
use of their standard-action basic attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battleweavers will use their “jab” strikes to wander around the battlefield and
disrupt PC formations while their aura damages and marks enemies. Like a
swordmage, it will try to stay far away from enemies it has marked, to increase
the chances of their mark triggering. It will use its stronger longsword attacks
to punish mark-ignoring PCs or to pile on more damage on a target it wants to
focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thought-weaver&quot;&gt;Thought Weaver&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A weaver that specializes in the power of the mind. It usually doesn’t go out
hunting like the others - instead it can be found in weaver ruins working to
restore their gates and furnaces. If forced to fight, it will do so entirely
through the use of psionic powers, barely moving unless absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thought weavers are Level 27 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 500
HP. Their basic attacks are minor actions:: &lt;strong&gt;Quick Strike&lt;/strong&gt; is a standard melee
attack, and &lt;strong&gt;Mind Spike&lt;/strong&gt; is a ranged attack that deals psychic damage,
inflicts a -2 penalty to all defenses for a turn, and slides the target 3
squares. They can also &lt;strong&gt;Extract A Psionic Soul&lt;/strong&gt;, targetting a PC with psionic
powers with the same standard Extract Soul effects. As standard actions, it can
use two powerful mind control techniques:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Puppet&lt;/strong&gt; is a non-damaging attack that slides the target 5 squares,
forces them to make a basic attack against a target of the weaver’s choice, and
then dominates it (save ends). It recharges when no one is dominated by the
power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command the Puppet&lt;/strong&gt; automatically hits someone dominated by Mental Puppet. It
deals psychic damage and has the same rider as the other power (slide 5 squares,
make a basic attack).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone leaves a square adjacent to the dominated puppet, the weaver can use
&lt;strong&gt;Guardian Puppet&lt;/strong&gt; as an interrupt to have the dominated character use a basic
attack against the triggering enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tought weavers can also choose to spend a standard, move, or minor action
directing a &lt;strong&gt;Coordinated Strike&lt;/strong&gt;, which essentially gifts the spent action to
an ally within 5 squares and allows the ally to immediately take that action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hex-weaver&quot;&gt;Hex Weaver&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the weaver attuned to the Shadow power source. And what is the Shadow
power source? As far as I know it’s basically “Arcane in a Halloween
costume”. It started getting mentions as something distinct around this time,
and would get a supplement all to itself named Heroes of Shadow the next year.
To my knowledge it never got very popular due to this conceptual confusion with
arcane magic and due to most of its associated classes not being very
good. Anyway, it got a weaver here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hex Weavers are too cool to hang out with other weavers, and instead oversee
portals into the Shadowfell from which they launch expeditions to pursue
mysterious goals that may or may not be related to the overall plan of the
weaver civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Hex Weaver is a Level 27 Elite Lurker with 382 HP, and it’s also too cool to
follow the same rules as the other weavers. Its minor action attacks are
&lt;strong&gt;Extract Shadow Soul&lt;/strong&gt;, which has the usual effects but only targets creatures
with shadow powers, and &lt;strong&gt;Shrouded Eye&lt;/strong&gt;, a ranged attack that deals psychic
damage and makes the weaver invisible to the target for a turn. The latter can
only be used once per round, which breaks from the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also the weaver with the highest number of standard action powers:
&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Grasp&lt;/strong&gt; is a stronger, melee version of Shrouded Eye; &lt;strong&gt;Stinging
Shroud&lt;/strong&gt; is a close burst 1 that deals necrotic damage and is much stronger
against creatures granting combat advantage to the weaver. And &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Mask&lt;/strong&gt;
is an encounter power that makes it invisible for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the weaver is damaged, it can &lt;strong&gt;Step Into Shadow&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+) to
become insubstantial for a turn and teleport its speed as a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hex weavers are a bit disappointing. They’d be a lot more dangerous if Shadow
Mask was a recharge or at-will power, or if Shadow Grasp was a minor
action. They also had the problem that there weren’t a lot of shadow-based PCs
around when they were published, because Heroes of Shadow was like six months
away from its release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not familiar with weavers from previous editions but I really like their
lore here. The targetting restrictions on their Extract Soul attack do feel a
little artificial, but are easily removed. I don’t like the shadow power source
very much, so I didn’t like Hex Weavers, but the others are quite flavorful and
powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I’ve been able to find out, verbeegs have been in the game since the
days of AD&amp;amp;D 1st Edition, first appearing in the Monster Manual II. This means
the game had already run out of synonyms for “Giant” even back then, since their
name is just a scrunched up form of “Very Big”. This is their 4e debut, with
somewhat new lore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verbeegs are a species of small-g giants who live in the same places of the
middle world and the Feywild where you might find hill giants and ogres. The
typical verbeeg is a lazy and greedy trickster who wants to make others work to
keep them in a life of luxury. Their great size and strength helps with this,
but they prefer to use their smarts and trickery to get what they want. Even
when the con is harder than plain robbery, it’s also often more fun for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example tale here is that of a verbeeg who set up at a river bridge and began
charging a toll. The toll was expensive, but the giant promised to only collect
it when the traveller came back to their side of the river. Travellers would lie
and promise they’d pay, and when they were in the middle of crossing the bridge
the verbeeg would lift the entire thing and tilt it towards himself, causing the
victim to slide back. “You promised, now pay up!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong verbeeg leader might be able to form a gang with several of his
fellows, increasing the scale of their racket. Verbeegs also find it easy to
take control of nearby groups of ogres and even hill giants, since their
intellectual limitations make them easy to fool. A verbeeg band in charge of a
larger ogre or giant band can be a threat to their whole region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verbeegs aren’t very big on fighting, despite being giants. They’ll avoid it for
as long as possible, preferring to throw minions at the problem or to use
trickery to escape and misdirect. If a battle is unavoidable, they favor mobile
and stealthy tactics and combat styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to all expectations, verbeegs do have a code of honor they always
follow. It consists of two rules: 1) never give a sucker an even break and 2)
always keep your word. They can try to twist the wording of a promise quite far
and add all sorts of clauses before committing to it, but once they do they must
keep it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine you can make groups of non-hostile verbeegs with the same ease you
could make groups of other friendly giants. In that case, the description above
would apply to the ones you fight, not to the species as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verbeegs are Large Fey Humanoids with the Giant keyword, even though their
origin has nothing to do with primordials or capital-G Giants. They have a Speed
of 8 and Low-Light Vision. Their signature trait is the hilarious &lt;strong&gt;Verbeeg
Stealth&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows them to hide and use the Stealth rules as long as even
as single square they occupy counts as providing total cover or concealment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-verbeeg-elephant.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    It's surprisingly effective if you're not expecting it.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;verbeeg-rowdy&quot;&gt;Verbeeg Rowdy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical verbeeg ne’er-do-well, of the kind you can find operating alone or
in command of a gang of ogre patsies. In larger bands they make up the
rank-and-file. It’s a Level 9 Skirmisher with 99 HP. It wears hide, carries a
shield, and wields a Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;spear&lt;/strong&gt; in battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spear can be used for basic attacks and for a &lt;strong&gt;Skewering Strike&lt;/strong&gt; that
deals more damage and slides the target 5 squares to a position within 2 squares
of the verbeeg. Perfect for getting those pesky defenders out of the way. All of
these deal bonus damage if the rowdy has combat advantage against the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also use a &lt;strong&gt;Bounding Maneuver&lt;/strong&gt; as an at-will move action, which
cancels any marks on them and allows them to shift 3 squares and to pass through
enemy spaces while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Cunning Trick&lt;/strong&gt; minor action (recharge 5+) is a reach 3 attack vs. Will
that does no damage and knocks the target prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a rowdy has to fight, it’s not gonna stay still, and it’s going to focus on
knocking people down and skewering them with its spear before bounding away to
safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;verbeeg-ringleader&quot;&gt;Verbeeg Ringleader&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sort of individual you might fight running a gang of other verbeegs and
dumber lackeys, and the one responsible for coming up with their verbeeg
plans. It’s Level 11 Artillery with the Leader tag and 91 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ringleaders are warlord-types and project an aura of &lt;strong&gt;Cunning Insight&lt;/strong&gt; (5)
that gives bonus damage to an ally that has combat advantage against their
target. They carry &lt;strong&gt;Spears&lt;/strong&gt; but prefer to stay away and use their
&lt;strong&gt;Longbows&lt;/strong&gt;, whose basic attacks make the target grant combat advantage for a
turn. &lt;strong&gt;Distracting Shot&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) and also gives an ally in reach a free
melee attack against the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the very flavorful &lt;strong&gt;Get Them!&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power allows three allies
within 5 squares of the ringleader to make a charge attack for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;verbeeg-trickster&quot;&gt;Verbeeg Trickster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one manage to score a spellbook or two and learn some combat magic. It’s a
Level 11 Controller with 115 HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;spear&lt;/strong&gt; strikes knock the target prone
on a hit, and they have four spells:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staggering Bolt&lt;/strong&gt; is a ranged attack that deals force damage and slides the
target 1 square; &lt;strong&gt;Blinding Blast&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Fort, recharge 5+) deals
light radiant damage and blinds for a turn; &lt;strong&gt;Bewildering Bolt&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter)
deals psychic damage and prevents the target from attacking (save ends); and
&lt;strong&gt;Concealing Mist&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) creates a zone of mist in a close burst 2. The
zone is lightly obscured, and gives any verbeeg that starts their turn inside
combat advantage against every enemy outside the zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tricksters want to set their mist zone up and stay inside while they shoot at
the PCs outside it with their spells. Staggering bolt helps keep them outside,
and Bewildering Bolt is excellent to shut down controllers or ranged strikers
for a while. IF there’s a ringleader in the same encounter they’ll also want to
stay inside the mist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly personable and very big fey rascals. I wouldn’t want to make the
entire species fit the stereotype, but verbeeg bandits are a nice surprise to
spring on players who expect the giants plaguing the land to be dumb brutes
incapable of subtlety. Add 4 levels or so to the stat blocks present here and
you can upgrade their underlings from ogres to hill giants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have lots of fun as a GM if you have your party fight a verbeeg bandit
gang on a series of hilltops crowned by standing stones. It’s both a very
fey-themed arena, and gives them plenty of hiding places. “These guys are ten
feet tall, how could they sneak up on us like that?!”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Umber Hulk</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-umber-hulk.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MM3 Umber Hulks are in a similar situation to a lot of other monsters in the
book. The Monster Vault would soon be released with an &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2021/01/20/umber-hulk.html&quot;&gt;updated selection of
basic models&lt;/a&gt;, and so this one features a trio of more niche variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, the basic lore remains the same, but this entry adds some interesting
new details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first new bit is that umber hulks are one of the oldest species in the
world! The creatures are already mentioned in certain ancient records from
before the Dawn War, which makes some sages think they emerged from the raw
stuff of the world before the primordials had finished creating it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is that their role as the world builders of the Underdark has a dark
side. Their tunnels may end up linking places that were best left isolated, like
two mutually hostile settlements. This is one of the reasons why underdark
civilizations tend to hunt them down. Some dwarves are also fond of chasing
umber hulks as they tunnel through the earth, for they commonly pass near veins
of precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, these creatures are not a middle world exclusive! In ages past, small
populations of them found and walked through subterranean planar portals and
spread to places such as the Astral Sea or even the Abyss, and proceeded to
adapt to these new environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umber Hulks are Magical Beasts and have a ground speed of 5 and a burrow speed
of 2 with Tunneling, which means their digging creates stable tunnels. They have
Darkvision and Tremorsense 5 as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;umber-ravager&quot;&gt;Umber Ravager&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a smaller and weaker relative of the basic umber hulk, so named because
it’s Medium and so it’s not technically a “hulk”. They wander closer to the
surface and are likely to be the first variant found by PCs who are not yet
powerful enough to brave the true Underdark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ravager is a Level 7 Brute with 95 HP. It can attack with a &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; that
does light physical damage, and can be used in a &lt;strong&gt;claw flurry&lt;/strong&gt; that allows it
to make two attack with a single action. Its most basic psionic power is a
&lt;strong&gt;Crushing Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 3 vs. Will) that deals light psychic damage and
knocks targets prone. Less often it can use a &lt;strong&gt;Disarming Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 3
vs. Will, recharge 6+) as a minor action that deals no damage but causes stun
(save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umber Ravagers hunt in packs, so you might see encounter groups featuring
several of them. Each one will target a different PC with its Disarming Gaze as
an opening move, and then focus its attacks on the stunned target. Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;abyssal-hulk&quot;&gt;Abyssal Hulk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hulk’s ancestors managed to dig their way to the Abyss, and then suffered
mutations that allowed to survive there. Its bodily secretions became acidic,
and its psionic powers changed to be more madness-themed. It’s also smarter and
more consciously malevolent, with a Chaotic Evil alignment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abyssal Hulks are Level 15 Controllers with 152 HP. They fight up close with
Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt;, and with a &lt;strong&gt;Gaze of Chaos&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 3 vs. Will) that
deals light psychic damage and slides the targets 3 squares on a hit. After
sliding, the targets make a melee basic attack against a target of the monster’s
choice. It can also spray forth some &lt;strong&gt;Acidic Spew&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Fort) to
inflict 10 ongoing acid damage (save ends) on those it hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, the abyssal hulk can use a &lt;strong&gt;Gaze of Crushed Will&lt;/strong&gt; (close
blast 5 vs. Will) to slide targets 3 squares and inflict a -5 penalty on any
saves they roll during this movement. You know when you roll a save during
forced movement? When someone uses it to push you off a cliff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, this cruel mutated almost-demon wants to alternate pushing people off
cliffs with making them stab each other while singing “stop hitting
yourselves!”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;astral-hulk&quot;&gt;Astral Hulk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite going to the realm of shiny light, Astral Hulks aren’t any less
unpleasant than their abyssal counterparts. There are signs that they may have
been engineered on purpose by some primordial for use as a weapon, because they
just love to dig into astral domains and tear them up until they become
free-floating debris fields. Several such domains were destroyed by astral
hulks, and the people of the Astral Sea are always on watch against astral hulk
infestations. Their gaze causes a pronounced lethargy on victims, and lures them
closer so the creature can use its natural weapons on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Astral Hulks are Level 17 Soldiers with 167 HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; damage and mark
for a turn on a hit. If a marked enemy shifts, the hulk can use &lt;strong&gt;Entrapping
Mandibles&lt;/strong&gt; on them as an interrupt, grabbing them on a hit. Their &lt;strong&gt;Gaze of
Lassitude&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude) deals untyped damage, pulls 4 squares,
and slows (save ends). Their &lt;strong&gt;Gaze of Annihilation&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5
vs. Fortitude) is an encounter power that does untyped damage, half on a hit,
and marks everyone it hits for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like umber hulks, you’ll find a use for these. I like that they’re all
very focused in their design intent. There’s one to introduce your players to
the monster earlier, and two to make them despair after they thought they had
left these things behind when they moved out of the middle world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Tulgar</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-tulgar.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I’m seeing this monster. If they appeared in previous
editions, it was with a different lore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, during the days of the Dawn War, there was a certain place in
the world that was a major nexus of primal power, connected to a great number of
spirits. This place was annihilated by one of the many cataclysms being thrown
around as weapons during that war. It was not the target - it was collateral
damage. And it was a god who pulled the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spirits of that sacred site were cast into the world, rootless and
homeless. Spirits of place without a place, their rage against the gods knew no
bounds. In order to survive, they cast part of their spiritual nature aside and
took on material forms made of flesh, becoming the first tulgars. And then they
swore to destroy the gods and their servants in revenge for what was done that
day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tulgars would soon find out that attaining their revenge was much harder
than they thought. After the Dawn War ended, the gods retreated to their domains
and no longer stepped into the world. Their followers very quickly grew in
number and built complex societies that were much harder to destroy than the
scattered fleeting villages of the War. Many of the tulgars gave up on their
oath over the ages, and now live as bitter mercenaries. Some of them, though,
still keep that flame of hate going and try to find ways to accomplish their
original goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metaphysically, a tulgar is more or less the primal equivalent of a daeva or
rakshasa. When they die, they are immediately reincarnated elsewhere in the
world in a new adult body, with intact memories of their previous lives. I don’t
think they can reproduce by natural means, but they have been increasing their
numbers. They can sense when a primal spirit loses its home or becomes hateful
of sapient mortals or their gods, and converge to the spirit’s location to
convince it to join their numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tulgars are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground Speed of 7 and the Forest
Walk trait. Their signature ability is &lt;strong&gt;Unbroken Spirit&lt;/strong&gt;, which triggers when
they hit 0 HP and gives their nearest ally a “parting gift” of 10 temporary HP
and a +2 to attacks, defenses, and damage that lasts for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the stat blocks here present us with early-epic threats, which is
appropriate for a people who swore vengeance on the gods and has a real shot at
achieving this. It’s possible they would make good allies for the Forsaken,
since they have similar goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tulgar-flesh-hunter&quot;&gt;Tulgar Flesh Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hunter of sapient prey, with centuries of accumulated experience. This is a
Level 22 Skirmisher with 209 HP. It fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Spear&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;Handaxe&lt;/strong&gt; it
uses as a thrown weapon. Its &lt;strong&gt;On the Hunt&lt;/strong&gt; trait makes it not provoke
opportunity attacks when it moves for a turn after hitting an enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flesh hunter can use &lt;strong&gt;Hunter’s Onslaught&lt;/strong&gt; to make both a spear and a
handaxe attack against different targets on its turn. The ranged attack doesn’t
provoke opportunity attacks when used as part of this power, and the power can
be used in place of a basic attack during a charge! In other words, no reason to
use a single basic attack when this is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, flesh hunters can use a &lt;strong&gt;Rotting Strike&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) to deal
light damage and inflict ongoing necrotic damage on the target (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tulgar-savage&quot;&gt;Tulgar Savage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unfortunately named enemy is a Level 22 Minion Brute. They have a &lt;strong&gt;spear&lt;/strong&gt;
and a &lt;strong&gt;handaxe&lt;/strong&gt; like the flesh hunter, though it does minion-scale
damage. Their &lt;strong&gt;Critical Threat&lt;/strong&gt; ability allows them to crit on a 19-20, and
when they do they grant a free melee basic attack to an ally within 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and they have Unbroken Spirit too, so they make a powerful contribution to
their allies by dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tulgar-half-spirit&quot;&gt;Tulgar Half-Spirit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tulgar that keeps more of its spirit side than most others. It’s a Level 23
Lurker with 116 HP, and it’s Insubstantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; that deals minor necrotic damage and immobilizes
for a turn. It also turns the tulgar invisible for a turn as an effect. If it
hits someone who can’t see it, the half-spirit also dazes the target for a turn,
so there’s your lurker loop right there. It can also throw &lt;strong&gt;handaxes&lt;/strong&gt; if no
one is at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the half-spirit becomes bloodied for the first time, it &lt;strong&gt;Unleashes the
Inner Spirit&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 3 vs. Fortitude), dealing necrotic damage and
stunning those it hits for a turn. The half-spirit then becomes invisible for a
turn and teleports 5 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tulgar-warrior&quot;&gt;Tulgar Warrior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This elite combatant doesn’t care about ranged attacks, and is all about
charging to melee and laying waste to armies. It’s a Level 23 Brute with 265
HP. Its &lt;strong&gt;Inveterate Warrior&lt;/strong&gt; trait makes it crit on a 19-20, and deal 3d12
extra damage on a crit. That last bit might just be a codification of its
&lt;strong&gt;greataxe’s&lt;/strong&gt; High Crit trait, since it’s not spelled out in this stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warrior’s basic axe attacks also inflict a -2 AC penalty for a turn. Its
&lt;strong&gt;Whirling Frenzy&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver is an encounter power that allows it to attack
everyone in a Close Burst 1, shift 3 squares and repeat the burst attack once
more against anyone who wasn’t hit by the first one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tulgar-spirit-talker&quot;&gt;Tulgar Spirit Talker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some tulgars retain a stronger connection to their former spirit nature and can
use that to cast spells. However, the other side of that connection is still
&lt;em&gt;broken&lt;/em&gt;, and this slowly erodes their mental stability. Over time, a spirit
talker might become unable to live in its community, and the others consider it
a mercy to kill them so that their minds might be mended by the process of
reincarnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spirit Talkers are Level 24 Controllers with 225 HP. They project a &lt;strong&gt;Primal
Barrier&lt;/strong&gt; aura (2) that makes all spaces inside difficult terrain for creatures
without phasing or forest walk. It fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Spear&lt;/strong&gt; whose attacks make
the target be marked by one of the tulgar’s allies within 10 squares. Its ranged
basic attack is the &lt;strong&gt;Incite Savagery&lt;/strong&gt; spell, which deals psychic damage and
has an interesting rider. If the target doesn’t make a melee attack on its next
turn, it grants combat advantage until the end of its following turn. A great
power to use on primarily &lt;em&gt;ranged&lt;/em&gt; attackers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action the spirit talker can cast &lt;strong&gt;Dismissal&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+), which
targets a conjuration, summoned creature, or zone within 10 squares. It attacks
the Will of its creator, and on a hit it causes the target effect to end! If
there’s nothing to dispel, the spirit talker can use &lt;strong&gt;Call Spirit Warrior&lt;/strong&gt; to
summon a tulgar minion to its side, acting right after it in initiative order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of Unbroken Spirit, the Spirit Talker has &lt;strong&gt;Death’s Embrace&lt;/strong&gt;, which
works the same but makes its aura stick around as a zone with the same effects
until the end of the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the lore of the tulgars here, because you can see how they might have a
reason for being bitter and angry. I’ll note that the stat blocks here are all
Unaligned, which means the book might agree with me. The only thing I dislike
here is the use of the word “savage” in both the minion’s name and the spirit
talker’s ranged attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can play some tulgar groups as being vengeful against the gods and perhaps
leaning more towards Evil, but you can also portray them as people who gave up
on that vengeance but still can never go back to what they were, which is a very
different story. Maybe some of them might be looking for a way to become full
spirits again, and it might be something that brings them into alliance with the
PCs or with sympathetic NPCs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thri-Kreen got famous as one of the playable options for AD&amp;amp;D’s Dark Sun. This
is their 4e debut. They would return as fully-supported playable characters in
the 4e Dark Sun Campaign Setting, about 3 months after the publication of the
MM3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thri-Kreen are mostly-humanoid sapient insects, adapted to live in arid
climes. They’re all over the Dark Sun setting, but even in this more generic
version their preferred habitats are deserts and arid wastelands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thri-Kreen tradition says they were created by the great primal spirit known to
them as Sand Father, and to other species as Old Grandfather. Sand Father looked
at the deserts of the world and found them too empty for his taste. So he
plucked a species of sand beetle from the world and made them into the first
thri-kreen. Realizing that size and strength would not be enough to guarantee
their survival, Sand Father also gave them the wisdom of the lizard and the
cunning of the desert fox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the distant past, the thri-keen managed to form a large empire that spanned
many of the world’s deserts, a nation known as Val-Karri. It lasted for a
hundred years before it was subjugated and assimilated by the dragonborn empire
of Arkhosia. The thri-kreen recovered their freedom when Arkhosia fell, and
returned to a nomadic lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern-day thri-kreen regard people who live outside the desert as weak, for
only those tested by the sands are worthy of respect. Though they draw no maps
or formal borders of their desert territories, they guard those territories
fiercely and are quite harsh to interlopers who try to pass through without
paying homage to them first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as these protocols are observed, thri-kreen are content to leave other
to their business and to go about their own. They’re very well adapted to their
chosen habitat and don’t need to raid neighbors for resources or anything like
that. Thri-kreen communities tend to be small and nomadic, and might go for
years without meeting other sapients. They display good aptitude for primal
magic and psionic powers, and are often good allies to any druids and wardens
that also make the desert their home. Thri-kreen villains are usually in service
to evil primal spirits, demons, or other groups who corrupt and transform the
land to suit their own foul purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thri-kreen are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 7 or 8 and
low-light vision. Their signature ability is the &lt;strong&gt;Mantis Jump&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter
power which allows it to jump a number of squares equal to its speed without
provoking opportunity attacks. Most stat blocks here combine martial training
with minor psionic powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thri-kreen-ambusher&quot;&gt;Thri-Kreen Ambusher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are young adults who spent their childhoods learning about the land and,
upon coming of age, are cast out of their tribe to survive alone for a
year. They travel widely to hone their skills, and their extended periods of
solitude also allow them to develop their latent psionic powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambushers are Level 6 Lurkers with 58 HP and a Speed of 8. They fight with two
&lt;strong&gt;spears&lt;/strong&gt; in melee and with a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Stab&lt;/strong&gt; power at range. The power deals
light psychic damage and dazes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also use a &lt;strong&gt;Spinning Spears&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver. This deals about half the
damage of a basic attack, but also gives them a +5 bonus to all defenses for a
turn and recharges their &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Boost&lt;/strong&gt; ability. This one allows them to add
extra psychic damage to a Spear or Mind Stab attack after it hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, this is a lurker who doesn’t hide. It will alternate boosted Spear/Mind
Stab attacks with Spinning Spear. It’s still pretty good at hiding as well,
which is why it’s called an Ambusher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thri-kreen-scout&quot;&gt;Thri-Kreen Scout&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scouts keep watch over their territories and can stand still for hours under the
blazing sun while doing so. They warn the rest of the group when they spot an
intruder, and are cautious to engage them, preparing traps in advance. If a
direct fight starts, they’re frenetic combatants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scouts are Level 7 Skirmishers with 80 HP and Speed 8. They fight with
&lt;strong&gt;Spears&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Shuriken&lt;/strong&gt;, and can perform &lt;strong&gt;Leaping Attacks&lt;/strong&gt; to move their
speed and make a stronger spear attack at any point during the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If hit by an attack, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Sudden Recoil&lt;/strong&gt; to shift 1 square away as a
reaction. If the attack bloodies them, they can shift 4 squares instead. They
also have a &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Boost&lt;/strong&gt; power similar to that of the Ambusher, though this
one recharges automatically on a 5+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scouts will alternate boosted basic attacks with Leaping Attacks, and will
probably have traps lying around the battlefield if they were expecting
company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thri-kreen-desert-talker&quot;&gt;Thri-Kreen Desert Talker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a primal spellcaster with powers over the desert sands. They tend to act
as judges in thri-kreen communities, trying those who break their laws and
customs and punishing the guilty. The most severe punishments are execution and
exile to the desert, but I imagine there are smaller ones for lesser offenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sand Talkers fight with their bare &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; and throw &lt;strong&gt;shurikens&lt;/strong&gt;, but they
also have a couple of sand-bending spells for use in combat. &lt;strong&gt;Shifting Dune
Rend&lt;/strong&gt; (area 1 within 10 vs. Reflex) deals no damage, but knocks prone on a hit
and slides 2 squares as an effect. &lt;strong&gt;Desert Tempest&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5) deals
minor physical damage, pushes 2 squares, and blinds (save ends). It recharges
when the thri-kreen is bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this pushing around synergizes with &lt;strong&gt;Sand Trap&lt;/strong&gt;, a minor action that
allows it to create three of the things within 10 squares. When an enemy starts
their turn in a sand trap square, they are restrained for a turn, and then the
sand trap disappears. The power recharges when there are no sand traps left in
the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desert talkers are good for breaking up PC formations and setting things up for
their allies, which is exactly what they’ll spend the first few rounds
doing. Their special attacks do very little damage, but their basic ones are
okay and a good choice once all the PCs are good and restrained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impression&quot;&gt;Final Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love thri-kreen! Whether they’re from Athas or not, I find their look
extremely interesting, and I also liked that this generic version of their
culture does not make them universally hostile.&lt;/p&gt;
