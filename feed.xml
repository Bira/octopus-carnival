        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: River District</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The River District occupies the city’s northeastern quadrant and was where most
of the city’s merchant class lived, and also the location of a couple of wizard
towers. These homes were not as nice as those of the Blacklake nobles, but they
were still sturdy and are still mostly standing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s River District is much more dangerous and hostile than Blacklake. The
many guardhouses and security walls here now act as prime ambush spots. It’s
protected from the Chasm by the river, but monsters from the wilderness outside
can freely wander in. The main source of danger, however, are the Many-Arrows
Orcs. Neverember has so far failed to dislodge them, and maintains an uneasy
truce punctuated by skirmishes while he thinks of a way to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mintarn mercs mostly stay away from the River District, making it a good
place for shady deals if one can dodge the orcs. Hot-blooded youngsters also
love to go here on dares, despite their parents’ protestations. And while
scavengers have long taken all of the most obvious treasure, there’s still some
left in secret stashes all over those merchant mansions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fallen-tower&quot;&gt;The Fallen Tower&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This used to be a wizard’s tower, but it was destroyed during the
Spellplague. Some time later, its ruins became a tavern whose main attraction is
the nightly haunt showing the deaths of the wizards as they fall from a great
height into what is now the tavern’s cookfire at the center of the common
room. Charming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place was vacant when the orcs found it but it still contained a lot of
stored food and drink, so they reopened it for their own use. Lord Neverember
and Commander Vansi have declated The Fallen Tower to be neutral ground, and
their envoys meet here when they have cause to talk. Non-orcs deemed worthy to
share a drink with the Many-Arrows are also allowed to frequent the Tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cloak-tower&quot;&gt;The Cloak Tower&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cloak Tower was once the headquarters of a mage guild called The
Many-Starred Cloaks. It vanished into thin air at the height of the Spellplague
and rematerialized six months later at a different address, without its
wizards. People who have tried to explore it in the past were turned away or
killed by its magical wards and traps, and everyone thought the same would
happen to the orcs. However, for some reason, they had absolutely no trouble
moving in and making this tower their home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-shard-of-night&quot;&gt;The Shard of Night&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This black stone tower appeared high above the River District during the
Spellplague and has floated there ever since. It looks like it was cut off from
its base, with an opening at the bottom. It casts no shadow during the day, and
when people walk under it their own shadows vanish as well. It does cast a
shadow by the light of the moon, and even though no one was ever seen to enter
or leave the place, eerie sounds sometimes echo from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tower used to be part of a distant temple of Selûne, but it was cut off and
banished to the Shadowfell during a Netherese assault on that temple. After the
battle, they found out they could control where the tower appeared in the world,
so they sent it to Neverwinter during the Spellplague and left it there until
the day when it was needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it is needed, and they’re using it. The Shard’s enchantments allow it to
absorb shadows during the day and use them to power a teleportation circle
inside that links it to Xinlenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creatures infused with shadow power, such as the Scion of Shadow, are immune to
the absorption effect and still cast shadows while under the Tower. They also
feel a comforting pull from it, which might help clue them in to what lies
inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is the “bad” part of town. I imagine most who live here are either
Many-Arrows, allied with them, or sneaky enough to go undetected. I also think
envoys who want to go to the Fallen Tower for diplomacy with the orcs might need
some sort of token of safe passage, since it’s actually quite far from the
district’s borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profit-oriented parties could have some interesting adventures following up on
rumors of a big treasure cache still hidden in the River District, but most of
the hooks here involve dealing with the Many-Arrows somehow. Raiding the Shard
of Night is an interesting way to get to Xinlenal without a long and arduous
overland trek into the Woods, but that place is only approachable by “endgame”
parties.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Castle Never</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Castle Never sits on the northern bank of the river, in the Blacklake District
that takes up Neverwinter’s nortwestern quadrant. It used to be the seat of its
government, and home to its ruling family. The cataclysm wrecked it and killed
almost everyone inside. The surviving servants decided to seal its crypts,
vaults and grounds, hoping that a worthy heir might make use of them one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The castle’s ruins are still a towering landmark, and its foundations are still
solid. While many interior chambers were destroyed, some are still intact and a
lot of the interior is at least navigable - most notably the underground
bits. Now it houses several groups who compete with each other for territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book doesn’t give you maps, leaving those as an exercise to the GM. There’s
enough going on here that it could be a full megadungeon and the focus of the
campaign… or it could be “downsized” to the site of a single targeted delve
for groups who want to keep their focus elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;surface-areas&quot;&gt;Surface Areas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surface portion of the castle is partly ruined but still contains a large
number of navigable areas. There are some places of interest that should feature
in whatever map you draw for it, like the &lt;strong&gt;locked armory&lt;/strong&gt; or the odd places
detailed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drow-encampment&quot;&gt;“Drow” Encampment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This used to be a campsite in a hidden spot in the city, near Castle Never. It
was originally set up by Drizzt and Jarlaxe around the time of the cataclysm,
when they were here investigating the Thayans and trying to stop their
plan. They come back every once in a while to attempt to tie off those Thayan
loose ends, usually without much success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The location of the encampment was recently discovered, however… by their
&lt;em&gt;fans&lt;/em&gt;. These eager youths and would-be adventurers have made the spot into a
permanent “DrowCon” of sorts. They train together, challenge themselves by
delving the castle, and hope to become good enough to join their idols’
entourages once they return. Neither of the two celebrities have been back for a
while, but Jarlaxe has heard of these events and has sent some of his Bregan
D’Aerthe agents to mind the place and keep a watch for promising recruits from
among the fans. They are Xalbyn the quick-witted rogue, Kimmuriel Oblodra the
quiet and focused mage, and Aerlyse the half-drow psion who spies on the other
two for Jarlaxe. Xalbyn hides his drow heritage with a Hat of Disguise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book makes an effort to take this place seriously… but I just can’t see it
as anything but comic relief. It would be a funny place to use whether there are
Bregan Spies on the party or not. If there are, then I’m guessing the three
stooges here don’t know about them. Jarlaxe seems very fond of keeping his
underlings in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hall-of-ashen-mirrors&quot;&gt;Hall of Ashen Mirrors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a hallway inside Castle Never. It has huge windows and used to be lined
with mirrors, being a popular spot for young Alagondar heirs to practice their
regal posture. When the cataclysm hit, air pressure shattered all the mirrors,
filling the place with flying glass and killing everyone inside right before a
pyroclasm came in through the windows and turned the corpses to ash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the hallway is very, very haunted. When living people enter, it will
reconstruct itself, and the reflections in the mirrors will re-enact the events
that happened just before the explosion. The replay ends with the
explosion-and-pyroclasm combo, just as deadly as it originally was. Anyone
lingering here for too long is gonna have a bad time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;surface-factions&quot;&gt;Surface Factions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These groups make up the inhabitants of the castle’s above-ground
portion. They’re all hostile to each other, though some are more amenable to
befriending the PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ghosts&quot;&gt;Ghosts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the castle’s destruction was so sudden, pretty much everyone who perished
in it ended up becoming a ghost. They can be found all over the interior, and
are a varied lot. They’re not automatically hostile, and PCs who approach them
correctly might strike up some extremely useful conversations with them. However
they tend to talk in riddles both because they like it and because their sanity
might have been a little damaged in the last 30 years. And if the ghosts come to
believe the characters are just there to loot the ruins, they &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; become
hostile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thayan-forces&quot;&gt;Thayan Forces&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castle Never is Valindra’s second major focus in the city of Neverwinter (the
first is Neverdeath Cemetery, as we saw earlier). On the surface, her forces are
engaged in a small war against those of Talgath, which consists of a tense
standoff with occasional battles. There’s at least one residential area that
became isolated due to cave-ins after a battle. The ghoul troop that got trapped
inside passes its time wearing the former inhabitants’ clothes and pretending to
be nobility, waiting for a rescue that will never come. The PCs will probably
stumble upon them first. Other undead patrols can probably act as random
encounters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;talgath-watcher-of-castle-never&quot;&gt;Talgath, Watcher of Castle Never&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talgath the Beholder has recently moved in. He wants to be king of the castle,
starting with the ettercaps on the upper spires and working his way down. He
pays little attention to humanoid intruders like the PCs, unless they get in his
way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valindra sees Talgath as the greatest threat to her goals in the castle. She’s
sent people to kill him several times, but Talgath has defeated them all. Not
only is he a powerful monster in his own right, he also makes extensive use of
his charm ray to keep a small army of minions. He brought in a coven of harpies
and a pack of displacer beasts from outside, and has charmed many of the
assassins sent to kill him as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;independent-communities&quot;&gt;Independent Communities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The castle’s atrium was boarded up long ago, and the heat and darkness have
turned the garden within into a fungal paradise complete with a village of very
territorial myconids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its upper spires have been taken over by a group of ettercaps who used to live
in the dungeons but were pushed out and up by Valindra. She ignores them these
days, but Talgath is currently trying to enslave them. Their leader says he had
a prophetic dream where a group of outsiders would deliver them from the
beholder, which makes them more likely than usual to befriend the PCs (and give
them that quest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;underground-areas&quot;&gt;Underground Areas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The castle’s underground areas are structurally intact. The things that make
them dangerous are of another nature entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;neverneath&quot;&gt;Neverneath&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The castle had a sizable dungeon area underneath it, protected by strong wards
that let it survive the cataclysm intact. Radiation from the Spellplague pocket
at the bottom of the Chasm has altered the wards, however, making it so they
actively trap any who enter the dungeon, causing its corridors to shift and
close around these intruders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space here is all wonky. A straight corridor can lead you through a circuitous
route full of loops and circles. A door might lead you to a different place than
it did the fellow PC who was just in front of you. The place is filled with
self-resetting traps, and inhabited by a large pack of gargoyles who love to
attack anything fleshy they find. It also houses a small force of desperate
gnolls that stumbled upon it several months ago and haven’t managed to escape
yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vault-of-the-nine&quot;&gt;Vault of the Nine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below Neverneath lies the Vault of the Nine, where those legendary bodyguards
have been entombed to honor their meritorious service in life. If you’re using
the subplot where Valindra plans to reanimate them, her forces are already here
and have turned the vault’s many outer chambers into their base of operations,
filling it with guardian undead. If she manages to animate the Nine, she will
order them to kill and replace all of New Neverwinter’s leadership, including
Neverember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;player-tie-ins&quot;&gt;Player Tie-Ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would the PCs want to mess with this place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Neverwinter Noble&lt;/strong&gt; has the most reasons for wanting to do so. The ghosts
are likely to be their direct ancestors, for starters! The fabled Crown of
Neverwinter is also lost somewhere inside the castle, and it’s likely the most
definitive proof of legitimacy for anyone wanting to claim the throne. Legend
says the crown’s magic properties only work for someone of the line of
Alagondar, and that anyone else who tries to wear it gets simultaneously burned
and frozen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching the Vault of the Nine would also be a desirable goal for the Noble even
if Valindra’s forces are not down there. It could be possible to call the Nine
back into service through their oaths to the line of Alagondar, and if the noble
can do so that would be another excellent proof of their legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oghma’s Faithful&lt;/strong&gt; would also love to explore this place and find its many
lost historical secrets. They might be mostly interested in interviewing the
ghosts and finding any sealed off libraries, but finding a safe path to the
Vault would also be a worthy goal even if they wouldn’t actually want to loot
the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the &lt;strong&gt;Devil’s Pawn&lt;/strong&gt; might benefit from talking with the ghosts, as it’s
quite possible one or more of them have had to deal with a similar problem
in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For everyone else, Neverember is always hiring adventurers &lt;del&gt;stupid&lt;/del&gt; brave
enough to delve the Castle in search for the Crown or any other relics and
documents that might help increase his legitimacy. He also wants it to be clear
of monsters so he can move in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-crown-of-neverwinter&quot;&gt;The Crown of Neverwinter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get stats for the Crown, and it’s indeed a nifty item (level 15, head slot,
strong protections against mental conditions and a nice bonus to social
skills). The stats &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; include the genetic lock from the legend, so it’s up
to the GM whether those stories are true or not. The people certainly believe
them, in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the GM likes the idea of the Crown but doesn’t want to bother with the
Castle, the crown might be placed in another place that’s more relevant to the
campaign. As a lost artifact, it could turn up anywhere for any number of
reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the dynamic with the different factions here. There’s a lot going on in
this castle and as in any megadungeon the situation here feels a lot less stable
than even the one in the city outside. PCs who come in here are definitely going
to have a drastic effect whether they have themed ties to the place or not.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Blacklake District</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Blacklake district, named after the lake located here, was where most nobles
of Neverwinter used to live. Pretty much all of them died in the fires of the
cataclysm, but their very sturdy and well-built residences remained
standing. They sheltered many of the city’s survivors during the following
decades, even though the lake became a fetid, ash-choked pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Blacklake is a rough-and-tumble place still largely outside of
Neverember’s control. His forces have begun moving in and attempting to extend
the Enclave to the district, but so far they have not met much success. This is,
after all, where everyone who can’t stand his harsh rule lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Castle Never is located in Blacklake, and we will cover it in its own post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-driftwood-tavern&quot;&gt;The Driftwood Tavern&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place where everybody knows your name. The Driftwood tavern has been open
since before the Cataclysm. Its owner, Madame Rosene, opened the tavern’s doors
to shelter refugees in the event’s immediate aftermath, and it became a kind of
makeshift city hall for the survivor community in the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the Madame is in her fifties and the tavern is filled with mementos and
relics of Neverwinter That Was, making it a sort of museum. Both the place’s
somber atmosphere and its high prices keep the Mintarn mercs at bay - the only
customers are long-time regulars and old friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This suits Madame Rosene just fine, because the Driftwood Tavern is also the
main headquarters of the Greycloaks faction of the Sons of Alagondar, which she
leads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A text box says that Madame Rosene would react positively to PCs who can
recognize the historical and sentimental value of the Neverwinter relics that
decorate her tavern, and that she might test their patience and resolve by
sending them on seemingly pointless quests to recover more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-beached-leviathan&quot;&gt;The Beached Leviathan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tavern is actually built out of an old pirate ship that ran aground decades
ago. Its owner Harrag was also the boat’s former captain. He presents himself as
an adventuresome scallywag but the truth is Neverember owns him. Anything people
say within earshot of him eventually makes its way to the lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tavern also acts as the current residence of Len-Jes, a watersoul genasi who
works as Neverember’s harbormaster. Her job includes keeping track of (and
taxing) every ship at port, and also dredging the bay to open more berths for
trade ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Len-Jes only took this job because if facilitates her second, much shadier
source of income. The exact nature of that is up to the GM. Is she a spy for an
Abeir trade house or pirate crew? Does she have buried treasure somewhere? Does
she actually work for some other faction like the Harpers or the Ashmadai?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vellgard-manor&quot;&gt;Vellgard Manor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mordai Vell’s family home. They used to be a prominent Neverwinter noble family
but they all died in the Cataclysm. Mordai Vell was the only survivor because,
as a tiefling, he was a source of shame and was sent away from town. As the sole
heir, he came back to reclaim his home shortly before Neverember arrived… and
he brought his Ashmadai buddies with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vell’s charisma and wealth soon secured him an informal community leadership
role in the district, and there are those who think he’d make a fine lord of the
city. I don’t think he ever made overt claims to the throne, but perhaps he will
when his cult is in a strong enough position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vellgard Manor is very well fortified, and guarded by a small army of cultists
and summoned devils. A direct assault would be difficult… but Vell likes to
party, so the PCs might get in by arranging invitations to his latest social
function. The devils are kept hidden during these. Of course, Vell is no fool,
so he might allow the PCs to get in and spring a trap on them if they’re not
subtle in their maneuvering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;house-of-a-thousand-faces&quot;&gt;House of a Thousand Faces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tavern used to be a fancy boutique, and it’s still decorated with
mannequins in old-fashioned clothing. It closed after the cataclysm and reopened
as a tavern when the city’s population began to recover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its owner, the elf Theryis, is a member of the Harpers. Her brother Toram took
over as the leader of the group once Cymril died. As mentioned elsewhere, these
two are the sole remaining full Harpers in the city, and they aren’t predisposed
to trust the PCs just because they’re PCs. Their default stance is to watch and
test them until they prove themselves properly heroic, or until they bring
evidence of the larger factions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toram, however, will attack the Harper Agent on sight because he’s convinced
they were responsible for Cymril’s death. He was in love with her, you
see… or, as the book puts it, &lt;em&gt;she was seducing him before her supposed
death&lt;/em&gt;. Make of that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All those secret society HQs gathered up in one convenient neighborhood! In most
campaigns the PCs are guaranteed to end up visiting one or more of them, either
to talk to its owners or to raid them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blacklake is not quite the “bad” part of town, but it definitely has a different
atmosphere from the Enclave. I’d portray it with a more “frontier” feeling -
it’s a bit more dangerous and run-down, but also more free, and the residents’
opinion of Neverember is significantly worse even when they aren’t involved in
organized resistance against him.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Overview and Protector's Enclave</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Neverwinter is a coastal city-state built at the mouth of a river. There are
several stories about how it got that name, but the most popular one is that it
was from the warm waters of that river, which prevent the delta from freezing
during winter and so keep its port viable year-round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing the book and the computer games, I see present-day inhabitants of
Neverwinter have a somewhat romanticized view of Nasher Alagondar, the former
adventurer who ruled the city about 150 years before this campaign starts. He
was an effective ruler, though, and his descendants formed a dynasty that
remained unbroken until the cataclysm 27 years ago, when the last of them died
or vanished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cataclysm wrecked the city, opening a huge chasm that destroyed its
southeastern quadrant and began to vomit forth mutated monstrosities. Most of
the citizens who didn’t die left as refugees, and only a minority of holdouts
decided to stay and protect their ancestral homes. They built a makeshift wall
to isolate the Chasm and its monsters from the rest of the city, and soon began
to see its defense as a sacred duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lord Neverember arrived nearly ten years ago at the head of an army of
carpenters and builders, protected by a mercenary force from Mintarn. Around
five years ago he established the Protector’s Enclave, a sort of “green zone”
taking up the southwestern quadrant of the city, which he declared safe for
occupation. There were already people living all over the city, but the
establishment of the Enclave opened the way for refugees to return and for new
immigrants to come seeking opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people of Neverwinter, then, can be split into two demographic groups: the
“holdouts” who never left the city, and the “newcomers” who arrived or returned
after Neverember declared it once again open for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-enclave&quot;&gt;The Enclave&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Enclave’s infrastructure has been restored to pre-cataclysm levels, more or
less. This includes the port, which has once again begun to see trade from
Waterdeep and elsewhere. The variety of goods in its markets does a lot to make
life in Neverwinter easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all is roses in the Enclave, though. Neverember’s government imposes a steep
tax on all commercial transactions, and the place is heavily policed by those
Mintarn mercenaries. The taxes are something one can get used to, but those
mercs have spies and goons stationed everywhere and love to employ all sorts of
excessive force against any perceived sign of dissent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neverember doesn’t personally care about this police brutality, but he does make
an effort to keep it at a level that’s beneath his notice, occasionally blaming
and punishing one of his underlings to get things to simmer back down for a
while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s discontent aimed at Neverember from a lot of sides. The holdout
population dislikes him because he’s taking credit for much of their work, and
sidelining them in his new government. The newcomers see him in a better light
but still dislike the heavy taxes and oppressive mercs. Those who like him
usually also like the whole New Neverwinter rhetoric and say the harsh measures
and heavy taxes are needed to keep the city’s restoration going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sons of Alagondar in particular see him as a foreign occupier and call him
Lord Pretender. If your PCs want to brawl with a guard patrol, saying those
words within earshot of them is the best way to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neverember’s current headquarters is at the Hall of Justice, the former temple
of Tyr. If you played the first Neverwinter Nights game you might recognize this
as your quest hub during Act 1. Tyr died in the Spellplague, but the citizens
refused to convert the temple to worship of another god. Neverember had it
restored and sponsors a group Torm priests that perform rituals following the
old Tyrran tradition in here. While many people see this move in a positive
light, the Sons of Alagondar claim Neverember’s presence defiles the temple and
call it the “Hall of Never-Justice”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-moonstone-and-other-earthmotes&quot;&gt;The Moonstone and Other Earthmotes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three earthmotes in Neverwinter. These were created by the
Spellplague, and became fixtures in the city’s skyline long before the
eruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first as the Moonstone, so called because it’s the current site of the
Moonstone Mask. Another familiar location from the computer games, this fancy
inn fell on hard times and shut its doors after the cataclysm. About five years
ago it reopened under new management, with some financial help from
Neveremeber. Liset Cheldar, the current owner, repays him by housing a large
number of Mintarn mercenaries in her establishment. They take up most rooms and
a bunch of them can be found there at all hours, dragging the atmosphere down
and picking fights with non-merc patrons. The Moonstone is lashed to the docks
with heavy chains, and connected by a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book suggests making Liset the puppet of one of the other factions, but I
think that’s a bit too cliche to make the pretty and flirty woman a secret
monster. The inn is already dangerous enough with all the mercs in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The southernmost earthmote is called Fisher’s Float, and it’s home and workplace
to a small community of fishers that have lived there since before the
cataclysm. Their catch provides a great deal of food to the city, though their
isolated location often gives rise to rumors of sinister goings-on. They’re just
rumors unless the GM decides otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mote that flies the highest and furthest from town is the Pirate’s
Skyhold. A gang of sky pirates used it as a base because it’s impossible to
reach without flight. One night, though, the pirates apparently all killed each
other in a frenzy of betrayal, leaving the island deserted. Their skyship, and
all of their treasure, are rumored to have stayed there intact - though other
rumors say that a dragon made the island its lair after a while. You can still
see the ruins of wooden buildings poking out of this island’s forested slopes,
but it remains inaccessible to most. The GM is explicitly encouraged to make
this place into a cool aerial dungeon of their own design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-wall&quot;&gt;The Wall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall was built by Neverwinter’s holdouts after the cataclysm. It separates
the southwestern quadrant of the city from the Chasm in the SE quadrant. It was
initially built from rubble and barricaded buildings, and manned by
martially-inclined survivors. Neverember reinforced it with proper defensive
architecture and assigned a significant chunk of his mercenaries to supplement
the survivor garrison. Those survivors still guard the Wall alongside the mercs,
because they see it as their sacred duty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with Neverwinter River, the Wall has been effective at preventing any
plaguechanged horrors from leaving the area of the Chasm, but recently some of
them have been spotted north of the river and near sewer entrances. Mayor Galt
fields several daily petitions for expanding the Wall further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guarding the Wall and repelling plaguechanged assaults is one of the quickest
ways to win the hearts and minds of the city’s inhabitants. The increasing
friction between the mercs who make up most of the guard forces and the hardened
native veterans who refuse to abandon their posts can also be a source of many
plot hooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-house-of-knowledge&quot;&gt;The House of Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This used to be a great temple to Oghma, occupying what is now the northeast end
of the Wall. After the cataclysm, the elderly Brother Anthus became its head
priest for a while, and they dedicated themselves to studying the plaguechanged
creatures that emerged from it. When Anthus died under mysterious circumstances,
the priestess Rohini took over and moved their whole operation to Helm’s Hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(To know the truth about those mysterious circumstances, check Rohini’s bio).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single volunteer priest remained behind to look after the temple’s extensive
library and archive, Brother Atlavast. Long years of solitude and isolation have
made the priest a paranoid eccentric. He keeps to the lower levels underground
and I don’t think a lot of people even remember he’s there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, Atlavast is ornery but not evil. He’ll be very happy to see Oghma’s
Faithful, for example, though he will insist on testing them and any other PCs
to see if they’re worthy of the archives. If they do manage to befriend him, he
can be a great help when exploring the library. Optionally, he might be in
thrall to the aboleths (like the rest of the priests over at Helm’s Hold), and
must be freed before he can become an ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surface levels of the temple, long abandoned, have been taken over by a
group of squatters which decided to make themselves useful by serving as
lookouts on the Wall and ringing the temple’s bells when they see monsters. The
mercs often leave them gifts of food and clothing, and are becoming fast friends
with them… unaware that the squatters are all undercover Ashmadai
cultists. They already managed to get one of the Mintarn captains possessed by a
devil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;neverdeath&quot;&gt;Neverdeath&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This huge graveyard was in use for centuries until the cataclysm, when the vast
expanse of graves and mausoleums was wracked by tremors. Some sections of it
sunk, others rose up, and these convulsions exposed graves and underground
crypts, causing coffins and bones to tumble about the whole area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current inhabitants of the city fear this place. The Mintarn mercs burn dead
bodies outside the city walls instead of burying them here. It’s not uncommon
for unburied bodies on or near the cemetery to rise as undead of their own
accord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t help that the Thayans have a major secret base in here, and are using
it as their main source of bodies for reanimation. The place also contains a
shadow crossing into Evernight, and Valindra has built a teleportation circle
here to make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherese are aware of the shadow crossing and one of their goals is to
destroy it or otherwise deny it to Valindra. They want to be discreet about it,
though, and don’t want to jeopardize their project to raise Xinlenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;waterclock-crypts&quot;&gt;Waterclock Crypts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neverwinter was once known for the amazing quality of its water clocks. The
guild responsible for making them built this crypt to inter its dead. Located
somewhere inside Neverdeath, it’s filled with clever traps and engines built
using hydraulics and elemental magic. Hidden here is the laboratory of its
founder, who first arrived in the city coming from Luskan with a cartload of
stolen magic knowledge. Its library contains all of that knowledge and more,
including notes on the original ritual that bound Maegera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An underground vein of elemental magic that links Luskan and Gauntlgrym passes
through the crypt - it’s why the founder’s lab was built here. Following the
vein could be one way in which the PCs find the lost city. Of course, they need
to get through all the undead and Thayans up above, as well as whatever defenses
this place has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-docks&quot;&gt;The Docks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding the docks was one of Neverember’s greatest priorities. While there’s
still plenty of work to be done here, the docks are already functional and able
to receive ships. Trade with the rest of the world has resumed, and the lord
makes a pretty penny charging tariffs on its cargo. There’s lots of crime and
corruption here as well, but I get the feeling Neverember only cares about it to
the extend that it impedes trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also here is the Tarmalune Trade House, belonging to a merchant guild from
Returned Abeir (the new continent a ways off to the west of Neverwinter). In
what might be an unexpected development, they’re just a normal trading house who
can offer supplies and filler quests to our protagonists. Their goal is entirely
mundane: to form commercial ties with the very lucrative markets at
Waterdeep. They’ll be extra-friendly towards any PCs that have ties to the
nobility of that city, like the Neverwinter Noble or the Devil’s Pawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this is the “safe” part of town there are still quite a few sources
of danger in it. A lot of that danger comes from the mercs, who will mercilessly
harass anyone who looks like they might start trouble, a description that fits
most PCs. Neverdeath will be a major location in any campaign focused on either
the Thayans or on Gauntlgrym.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Other Factions, Part 3</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll cover the minor factions that are located underground, in
and near the ruins of Gauntlgrym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dwarven city was a major metropolis in its heyday, and the capital of the
dwarven empire of Delzoun. Its underground location allowed it to survive the
fall of Netheril mostly unscathed, but it would fall to an orcish invasion a
couple of centuries later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original inhabitants of Gauntlgrym either perished in this attack or fled to
the surface, and the location of the city was lost to them after a few
generations. The history of the city did not end there, however, as passed
through the hands of several Underdark factions over time. It’s also still
inhabited by the ghosts of the dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means our encounter table here is mostly undead. While some dwarven ghosts
might be helpful to their descendants, most of the undead here are of the usual
mindlessly murderous variety. The table contains several skeletons, zombies,
ghouls, wraiths, ghosts, and even mummies. It also has dire corbies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dire-corbies&quot;&gt;Dire Corbies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These critters look like buff skeksis, and are given the same header style as
actual Gauntlgrym factions, but they’re not really organized enough to be called
that. This is mostly a “new monster” entry. Looks like they made their debut in
a Gauntlgrym-focused post in Dungeon 183.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry says they’re descended from predatory birds who were lost and trapped
in the Underdark a long time ago. The evolutionary pressure and uncanny
radiation of the Underdark changed them into these monstrous humanoids. Their
wings have been changed into powerful clawed arms, and their coal-black feathers
blend into the darkness. They’re predatory and ravenous, pulling themselves
through narrow underground tunnels and viciously attacking anything that looks
even remotely edible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dire Corbies are Medium Natural Humanoids and Level 7 Brutes with 96 HP. They
attack with &lt;strong&gt;Gashing Beaks&lt;/strong&gt; that do immediate and ongoing damage, and when
first bloodied emit a &lt;strong&gt;Rending Screech&lt;/strong&gt; that covers a Close Burst 2, deals
psychic damage, and inflicts Vulnerable 5 to Everything for a turn. A miss does
half damage with no riders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since they’re classified as Humanoids and have an Int of 11, it might be
possible that they could form more complex communities and interact with PCs in
non-violent ways… but as written the typical dire corby is Chaotic Evil and an
enthusiastic cannibal. Even if they weren’t, the stronger factions are fond of
enslaving them, so the PCs would still end up fighting dire corbies when facing
those groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mind-flayers&quot;&gt;Mind Flayers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The orcs that invaded Gauntlgrym were eventually conquered by mind
flayers. Those mind flayers ruled for a while, conducting an extended experiment
on illithid-derro hybridization, but that got out of control and the resulting
creatures kicked them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the primordial Maegera woke up for a brief time thirty years ago, the
resulting shakeup in Gauntlgrym allowed a new mind flayer colony to move in. I
guess they initially wanted to reclaim their old haunts, but shortly after
arriving their Elder Brain was targeted by the Abolethic Sovereignity’s Symphony
of Madness and infected with the Spellplague. Now the brain and its colony are
completely under AbSov control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mind flayers are researching the bound primordial on behalf of their
masters, and also act to protect it from meddlers and would-be conquerors. As
the aboleths funnel more and more Spellplague radiation to them, both the Elder
Brain and its subordinate illithids are becoming more mutated. The brain knows
what’s going on, but it’s become addicted to these energies and will keep
obeying the aboleths in exchange for its regular fix. The individual mind
flayers’ perceptions are clouded, however. They believe all is business as
usual and are incapable of perceiving their own mutations or discovering their
elder brain is working for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get stats here for a &lt;strong&gt;Plaguechanged Mind Flayer&lt;/strong&gt; (Level 8 Controller) and
the &lt;strong&gt;Plaguechanged Elder Brain&lt;/strong&gt; (Level 9 Elite Controller). They work a lot
like their baseline versions, adjusted to Heroic Tier. The illithid is of the
type that can perform thrall surgery on PCs instead of eating their brains. The
brain is mostly immobile (unlike its nimble base version) but has the usual
assortment of psychic attacks and an aura (3) that can strip resistance to
psychic damage. It can also use an interrupt to redirect forced movement effects
back to the enemy who tried to impose them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;duergar&quot;&gt;Duergar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These duergar are relatively recent arrivals to Gauntlgrym. Led by an unholy
warrior of Asmodeus named Kholzourl the Fire-Speaker, they have come here under
orders from their diabolical master. They’ve occupied a section of the ruined
city and resumed some of its ancient and abandoned mining operations. They’ve
enslaved dire corbies and other nearby sapients to work for them, but fear the
ghosts and undead that plague other areas of the ruins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only Kholzourl knows the expedition’s real goal, which is actually left for the
GM to determine (the book gives several options later). Regardless of that true
goal, they have been profiting from the ores extracted from the Delzoun mines,
which include iron, mithral, and a metal known as Hellthorn which takes
remarkably well to enchantments based on infernal magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The duergar and Ashmadai do not know about each other, and despite serving the
same masters the two factions have no inherent inclination to cooperate unless
directly ordered to do so by a devil emissary of Asmodeus. The default reaction
of the duergar to outsiders is “kill or enslave on sight”: they’re not here to
do diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one notable exception here: a duergar named Nimor Ironvoice found a
tunnel leading from Gauntlgrym to the surface. He disguised himself, explored a
bit, and found out about the Ashmadai. Now he has a profitable side gig
smuggling small quantities of hellthorn up the well and selling it to the
cult. He knows Kholzourl would punish him if he found out, and soon he will have
to decide between severing his ties to the surface or turning against his fellow
duergar. He’s hoping an infernal sign will tell him the way before either his
boss or Mordai Vell discover the truth by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The duergar get their own encounter table, which as expected is mostly made up
of duergar from the MM2 and Monster Vault. Kholzourl gets a stat block, which is
fairly typical aside from being level 9. We also get stats for Steeders, the
disgusting devil-spider-things these duergar use as mounts; and for Hellthorn
weapons, which start at Level 10/+2, do immediate and ongoing fire damage on a
critical, increase your fire resistance if you have any, and can let an allied
devil make a free attack once per encounter when you miss one of your own
attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;house-xorlarrin&quot;&gt;House Xorlarrin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Forgotten Realms drow house is said to be “atypical” because its matriarch
is less authoritarian than the others and even occasionally asks for input from
male advisors. But it also has a full-on eugenics program where males are “bred
for magical ability” and sacrificed if they turn out to lack it. So we’re back
on icky old-school drow territory here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newest arrival to Gauntlgrym is a Xorlarrin expedition. They’re after the
sleeping primordial, wanting to control it and use it to turn Gauntlgrym into a
drow capital to rival Menzonberranzan. Their encounter table is all drow and
unlike most others it goes up to level 14. We also get stats for a Drow
Spellspinner, a Level 8 Artillery mage that uses lightning-based spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These drow feel like an optional addition, and work best if you have a Bregan
D’Aerthe spy in your party. If that’s the case, they work well to tie that PC
more strongly to the campaign’s “endgame”, since the Bregan would want to
prevent a Drow house from gaining control of a primordial. For added drama, the
Xorlarrin could have been the ones responsible for destroying the PC’s own
house, or that of one of their friends. They’ve sent their own spies to the
surface, so that can provide the party with an initial lead to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fires-below&quot;&gt;The Fires Below&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is less of a faction and more of a grab-bag of thematically related
monsters. These are the elemental creatures that live beneath Mount Hotenow and
usually feed on slumbering Maegera’s ambient magic. They got very happy with her
awakening and the volcano’s eruption and some of them want to find a way to
awaken her for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most other groups with a similar goal, they don’t intend to control the
primordial once she’s awake, but to serve her instead. I don’t think they are
likely to succeed on their own, since they’ve been at it for 30 years with
nothing to show for it. They’re more intended as a group of secondary
antagonists that you find on your way to Maegera’s resting place… or as an
additional complication if someone else &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; manage to wake her up. Whoever
ends up controlling Maegera will also get to order these creatures around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The encounter table here is all about fire and/or earth elementals, and it goes
up to level 14. We also get a couple of new stat blocks for salamanders.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Minor Factions, Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing our exploration of the minor factions at play here, we’ll now look at
those whose presence or attention are centered on the Neverwinter Wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gray-wolf-uthgardt&quot;&gt;Gray Wolf Uthgardt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gray Wolves were just another typical Uthgardt tribe of no particular
distinction until a few hundred years ago, when they took in human refugees from
Gauntlgrym who had been fleeing their captivity by the mind flayers who lived
there. Some of those had been afflicted by lycanthropy. Time and primal magic
made this condition the tribe’s main power and badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of the Neverwinter campaign, this is kinda bad for the PCs
because the Gray Wolves have been captivated by the Shadovar’s honeyed words and
recruited as their agents and shock troops. They expect to be citizens of their
new world-spanning empire, and to be given dominion over all of the North’s
wilderness in exchange for their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, not all members of the tribe fell for this. Those that didn’t were
cast out and banded together into a group known as the Forsworn, who work to
oppose the works of the Netherese. The Forsworn avoid fighting their own kin,
but the Grey Wolves do not return the favor and try to kill them on sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book recommends using existing werewolf and shifter stat blocks when
building encounters against Grey Wolves, and gives us stats for a Werewolf
Stormcaller (level 6 Artillery) that fulfills a niche not usually covered by
those blocks. It also has stats for Ethraniev Marrowslake, a particularly
bloodthirsty Gray Wolf pack leader (level 7 brute). Both work as you’d expect
for werewolves, with the ability to change shape and both weapon and infectious
bite attacks. The stormcaller has ranged spells that do lightning or thunder
damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pack Outcast PC was among the first of the Gray Wolves to be exiled, since
they didn’t agree to join the Shadovar right at the start. The Forsworn were
exiled after that, as the tribe’s tactics became more and more violent. As the
campaign start, dissidents are being executed instead of exiled. The Outcast has
an easy in with the Forsworn as written, because the group will likely recognize
the PC as being right all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book says the GM is free to make the Forsworn still be evil if they don’t
want the PCs allying with them, though I probably wouldn’t do that. It leans too
much on the “savage barbarian” trope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs who become friends of the Forsworn might be granted an utility power named
&lt;strong&gt;Primal Surge&lt;/strong&gt; as a blessing or reward. It’s an encounter power that triggers
when you use one of your other encounter powers. It lets you roll a d20, and on
a result of 10 or higher the other power is not expended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iliyanbruen-fey&quot;&gt;Iliyanbruen Fey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the group the Iliyanbruen Guardian PC belongs to. As we saw earlier,
they’re descendants of eladrin who fled to the Feywild to survive the
destruction caused on their kingdom by the fall of Xinlenal. When the barriers
between worlds started thinning, they sent expeditions back to the place where
they crossed, and found it occupied by evil fey. They drove those out, and built
an outpost named New Shandarar on both sides of the portal. Then they explored
their old ruins in the middle world and discovered that they had been ravaged by
more than time and disuse - many of their sacred relics and cultural treasures
had been plundered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expeditionary force made it their mission to recover what was stolen. All of
them are pretty angry about this: the main difference is some of them are angry
just at the people responsible for the looting, while others are angry at All
The Mortals and want to genocide/conquer the region on principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether moderate or extremist, the fey of Iliyanbruen are likely to respond with
violence to anyone trespassing on their territory now, unless the Guardian PC is
with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expedition’s commander, Merrisara Winterwhite, is a moderate and the main
reason they haven’t started attacking the region. Several of the community
leaders under her, however, are extremists, and spend all of their time
agitating for more bloodshed. One in particular, a dude named Addemios
Three-Dawn, is a secret worshiper of Asmodeus and in league with the evil fey
the expedition drove away from the portal. He’s the assistant to one of the
city’s priests of Corellon, and his influence is responsible for a lot of the
recent upswing in violent sentiment among the eladrin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The encounter table for New Shandarar is made up of heroic-tier fey creatures:
elves, eladrin, dryads, unicorns, treants and lots of trained fey
beasts. Addemios is statted up as Level 5 Artillery with ranged and area
spells. He’s far from the most powerful individual in this faction, so I’m
guessing that getting them to back off would involve more than defeating
him. That’d still be an important step, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the extremists win out, the fey could move to “major faction” status
relatively quickly, as they are a significant military force with some pretty
powerful creatures. They certainly &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; they have what it takes to conquer
the region and kill everyone they dislike, but they are probably unaware of the
true extent of the Thayan, Netherese, and Aberrant presences here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cult-of-the-dragon&quot;&gt;Cult of the Dragon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Ashmadai, these cultists have a lot of trouble passing as typical
citizens. The local cell was busy with the usual Cult of the Dragon activities,
which are sucking up to evil dragons and trying to convince them to become
dracoliches. This changed when Valindra (the lich leading the Thayans) took
their leader’s Ring of the Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now they work for her as muscle and are also tasked with finding a way to raise
the dead Lorragauth as a dracolich. Their leader, Adimund Kroskas, is working on
that as slowly as possible while he tries to figure out a way to recover his
ring. He hasn’t made much progress in that either and desperately needs
something to change in his situation. He’ll probably try to make a move when a
significant setback occurs in Valindra’s plan - likely one caused by the PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their encounter table includes humans, genasi, dragonborn, and other “typically
playable” stat blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Minor Factions, Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looks like I accidentally skipped a few posts when making my last update! So
instead of going to chapter 04 now, we’ll finish out chapter 03 and look at the
minor factions over this and the next two posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factions are considered “minor” because they’re either simpler, less
powerful, or less involved in the region than the majors. Most don’t have custom
stat blocks associated with them, and even if they do I’ll only spend time on
them if they’re really interesting. This post covers the “urban” factions, those
whose territories and attentions are in the city proper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dead-rats&quot;&gt;Dead Rats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the wererat gang has a chapter in Neverwinter, led by a one-eyed
lieutenant of Toytere’s name Rrost. Their main racket is smuggling, and as the
campaign starts they managed to set themselves up as the middlemen in the
weapons trade between the Sons of Alagondar and the Thayans. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, the Rats would like to usurp control of the rebels and use
them to become big shots in the city’s underworld, remaking it in Luskan’s
image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their roster features rats, dire rats, and any low-level thug-types you can fit
in, the latter of which can be boosted by a wererat theme pack that gives them
regeneration, an infectious bite, and the ability to assume hybrid form. Rrost
uses the stats for a &lt;strong&gt;Wererat Mugger&lt;/strong&gt; introduced here, a Level 4 Brute with a
poisoned morningstar and a stronger bite than what’s in the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gang would love to kill the Dead Rat Deserter PC, and their ties to the
Thayans are just the thing to get that PC more personally involved in the
campaign’s larger plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rrost feels like a “Small Bad” who will be a problem at the start of the
campaign for city-focused parties. His plans are big but his faction has no hope
of seeing them realized before the PCs end the Rats’ ambitions for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sons-of-alagondar&quot;&gt;Sons of Alagondar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sons of Alagondar are die-hard Neverwinter nationalists who believe the city
should be independent of foreign control so that it can once again be the Jewel
of the North and a bastion of goodness. They draw most of their membership from
the holdout population of Neverwinter: those people who never left the city and
spent twenty years protecting and rebuilting it before Neverember arrived with
his mercs. As you might imagine, they vehemently oppose him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until very recently their overall leader was a Harper named Cymril, who was
brutally murdered under mysterious circumstances shortly before the start of the
campaign (as seen in the Harper Agent theme). Her death split the Sons into two
sub-factions along generational lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one side you have the Nashers, who take their name from the first Alagondar
lord (the one from the computer games). These young rebels are willing to pay
any cost to see a free Neverwinter and readily resort to violent actions like
rioting, assassination and sabotage. Their leader is a firebrand named Arlon
Bladeshaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other you have the older Graycloaks, who take their name from the old
city militia. They see themselves as focusing on the big picture, with the
city’s welfare as their highest priority. They focus on building support and
alliances with like-minded groups and the city’s population in general. They
also try to infiltrate and influence Neverember’s organization through bribery,
blackmail, and secret deals. Their leader is the human mage Madame Rosene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The Nashers call the Graycloaks “greyhairs”, and the Graycloaks call the Nasher
“gnashers”. Also, there’s a subsection here titled “Fractured but Whole”, which
I can never take seriously after learning about that South Park game.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the Nashers who decided to partner with and accept help from the Dead Rat
gang and the Thayans. Bladeshaper was a bit leery of this at first but he
quickly changed his mind once he saw his faction start racking up bigger
victories against Neverember’s forces. The Rats, as mentioned before, plan to
take over the Sons and make them into an extension of their planned crime
syndicate. The Thayans are using them to distract New Neverwinter from their own
shenanigans and are happy to push their own agents and the Sons to ever greater
heights of violence to that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The encounter table for the Sons is entirely composed of stat blocks belonging
to typically playable ancestries, matching Neverwinter’s demographics. Players
who oppose the Sons will do well to play on their divisions, those who want to
support them should focus on healing that same rift. Cymril’s death nearly broke
them completely, and finding the truth behind it would be a big goal in a
rebellion campaign. As we saw in the Harper Agent’s background, there’s room for
a variety of sinister explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impressions-1&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most complex of the minor factions here. It’s possible to make a
campaign entirely focused on the Sons’ struggle, but it would have to start with
earning their trust. They are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; predisposed to allying with PCs and are
likely to be actively hostile to certain themes like the Harper Agent or even
the Neverwinter Noble, whom they might see as just another pretender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;harpers&quot;&gt;Harpers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making Neverwinter into the bastion of good it once was is also part of the
Harper’s mission statement, and they are generally better at sticking to it than
the Sons, but they were broken even more thoroughly by Cymril’s death. She was
their highest ranking member in the area. With her gone, there are about a dozen
members left, and only two of them are full agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These local Harpers are pretty focused on opposing Neverember at the moment and
are completely ignorant of the machinations of the Thayans, Netherese, or
Aboleths in the area. It’s unlikely they will find out on their own, but if they
learn through other means they will instantly shift their focus to opposing
these greater threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs manage to acquire a reputation as local heroes, the Harpers might
approach them and ask them to help the Sons of Alagondar get back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impressions-2&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Harper presence in the city is larger than I was led to believe from reading
the Harper Agent theme. My inclination is to only include them as written if the
party doesn’t have one or more PCs with that theme. If it does, then the PC is
the sole Harper left in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;many-arrows-orcs&quot;&gt;Many-Arrows Orcs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The orcs of the North usually stayed away from the Neverwinter area, because the
city was hostile to them and they had many stories about how the surrounding
woods were haunted. They have recently dismissed these stories as myths and
grown a little bolder and more curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;King Obould XVII of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows recently sent a scout force here
with the mission to find what was going on and report back, but the force’s
power-hungry commander far exceeded her orders and decided to push into the city
and take over the Cloak Tower, claiming the surrounding territory in
Neverwinter’s ruined northern half as her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I remember correctly, Obould was depicted elsewhere as a reasonable king who
had the capability to turn his people away from their universally hostile ways
and forge more peaceful bonds with his neighbors. Commander Vansi is none of
those things. After taking over the Cloak Tower, she was approached by the
aboleths and gladly accepted a “blessing” of the Spellplague to get
stronger. There’s a stat block for her here. She’s a Level 6 Soldier (Leader)
that fights with a flail and a spiked gauntlet. The Spellplague covered her in
fiery bone spurs, so she loves to grapple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The encounter table for them is obviously all orcs all the time, with the
occasional ogre or half-orc thrown in for variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impressions-3&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kinda like that there’s a more elaborate reason than just “they’re chaotic
evil” for why this group of orcs are hostile occupiers. Neverember has an open
call for adventurers willing to help drive them out of town, and their
connection to the AbSov might be what clues the PCs in to the presence of that
faction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s even possible that King Obould would &lt;em&gt;reward&lt;/em&gt; the PCs for dealing with the
rogue detachment if you want to play up the newer, less hostile orcish
civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bregan-daerthe&quot;&gt;Bregan D’Aerthe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These assholes again. They wrung Luskan dry a few decades ago and left the area
when the cataclysm hit. Now a handful of their spies have made their way back to
seek profitable opportunities and report back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice this means you can spice up certain encounters with drow mercs or
informants. They have no elaborate goals for the area yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impressions-4&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this feels like a minor faction I would only use if there are no Bregan
Spy PCs in the party. If there are, then the PC is their sole representative in
the region. They appear again in a slightly more fun form in the upcoming
locations chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Chapter 4 Intro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here begins Chapter 4, the Gazeteer. This takes up the remaining half of the
book and focuses on describing interesting places in the region and their
associated plot hooks. It also talks about interesting NPCs that might get
involved with the group. These locations and people aren’t fully mapped or
statted out, but are intended to serve as starting points for individual GMs to
customize. As promised in the book’s preface, a lot of plot hooks here are
optional and/or multiple-choice, and GMs are free to change anything in here
however they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter covers several major areas, and we might need more than one post for
each of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruined Neverwinter&lt;/strong&gt; is the city proper, struggling to rebuild and deal with
political intrigue, dangerous ruins, and plaguechanged monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helm’s Hold&lt;/strong&gt; is a stout-hearted village with a monastic community that
hides a terrible threat to the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neverwinter Wood&lt;/strong&gt;: You wouldn’t believe how many dangerous places and
threatening factions can fit into this one forest!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gauntlgrym&lt;/strong&gt;: the hidden dwarven city no longer has any dwarves in it, but
it has pretty much everything else including that slumbering primordial.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evernight&lt;/strong&gt; is Neverwinter’s reflection on the Shadowfell and the main
battleground in the war between Thayans and Netherese.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thay Through the Veil&lt;/strong&gt;: PCs who follow the plot threads from Evernight all
the way to their end might find themselves needing to make some visits to Nazi
Necromancer Central.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Netherese Encounters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The encounter table for the Netherese is packed with shadow-themed
opponents. There are a few humans here and there, but also a lot of shadar-kai,
and Dark Ones, and a few new options to turn any of these into Shades. Since
they’re a magic-heavy faction the table also includes a few constructs and bound
incorporeal undead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shades&quot;&gt;Shades&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shades are creatures that absorbed so much of the Shadowfell’s ambient magic
that they mutated. They can also be born from otherwise “mundane” creatures who
absorbed that energy. As you might expect a lot of the Shadovar fit this
description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to turn a monster stat block into a Shade. The Forgotten
Realms’ campaign setting has a monster template that turns a regular monster
into an elite shade. And this book presents a theme that adds appropriate powers
to an existing creature without upgrading its “quality”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme changes the base creature’s origin to Shadow, adds Darkvision and
Vulnerable 5 radiant and also these three abilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt; 5, which shuts down for a turn when the creature takes
radiant damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coalescing Darkness&lt;/strong&gt;, a trait that gives the shade total concealment for a
turn whenever it moves 3 or more squares by any means.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Stride&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter power that takes a move action and lets the
shade teleport up to &lt;em&gt;20&lt;/em&gt; squares, but requires that the destination space be
in dim light or darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thaalud-constructor&quot;&gt;Thaalud Constructor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most fearsome security measures in Netherese tombs and ruins are the
constructs known as Thaalud Tomb Trappers. The Constructor is a modern design
based on those, weaker but easier to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all the lore we get for this monsters. Since I don’t know anything about
tomb trappers I’m forced to speculate based on their stats. I’m thinking they’re
huge eyeless humanoid statues, and quite a bit smarter than your typical
mindless construct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constructor is a Huge Natural Animate with the Blind and Construct keywords,
and a Level 5 Elite Brute with 154 HP. It’s immune to poison, blindness, and
gaze attacks, and has Resist 5 to cold, fire, and lightning. It perceives the
world with Blindsight 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It attacks with &lt;strong&gt;Mauling Fists&lt;/strong&gt; that damage and grab on a hit (escape DC 15),
and can make &lt;strong&gt;double attacks&lt;/strong&gt; with them. If the constructor has a Large or
smaller creature grabbed, it can throw it at someone else with &lt;strong&gt;Hurl Foe&lt;/strong&gt;, a
ranged attack that damages both the target and the “ammunition”. On a hit, the
target is pushed 1 square and knocked prone, and the hurled PC falls prone on
the target’s former space. On a miss both take half damage and the thrown
character falls prone adjacent to the target. I gotta say “grab and yeet” sounds
like a very fun combat style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a constructor is destroyed it &lt;strong&gt;Collapses into rubble&lt;/strong&gt;, attacking a Close
Burst 1 around itself and turning that area into a zone of difficult terrain
that lasts until the end of the encounter. Note that the creature is Huge, so
this zone is 4 squares on a side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clariburnus-tanthul-prince-of-shade&quot;&gt;Clariburnus Tanthul, Prince of Shade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shadovar are ruled by the Twelve Princes of Shade, Netherese mages who were
witnesses to the fall of their empire and managed to stay alive(-ish) to the
present day. Clariburnus Tanthul is one of these Twelve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to all expectations, he’s not undead! Tanthul is an ancient living
shade, and is described as retaining more of his original humanity than the
other Princes. Still, he’s a merciless manipulator with no concept of honor,
breaking his promises as casually as he breathes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clariburnus Tanthul is a Medium Shadow Humanoid and a Level 10 Elite Skirmisher
with 158 HP. He has a Speed of 7 and both Blindsight 10 and Darkvision. His
traits resemble those of the Shade theme above but they’re custom and more
powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His &lt;strong&gt;Benighted Presence&lt;/strong&gt; acts as an aura (5) that turns bright light dim, and
his &lt;strong&gt;Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt; heals 15 HP per turn, though it’s still shut down for a
turn by radiant damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wields a scimitar named &lt;strong&gt;Gloom Crescent&lt;/strong&gt;, which can make basic attacks and
is also used for the &lt;strong&gt;Severing Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; technique. This lets him make 2 basic
attacks (3 if bloodied), teleporting 5 squares before each one. If he hits the
same target twice that target also takes 5 ongoing force damage (save
ends). This worsens to 10 ongoing force damage and blindness after the first
failed save (save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter he can use a ranged spell named &lt;strong&gt;By Night Consumed&lt;/strong&gt;, which
deals necrotic damage and &lt;em&gt;removes the target from play&lt;/em&gt; (save ends). A miss
deals half damage and dazes (save ends). Nasty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Stride&lt;/strong&gt; lets him teleport 5 squares regardless of light
conditions, which increases to 10 if the destination is in darkness. It’s also a
(Recharge 4+) ability instead of an encounter power, so he can use it more than
once in a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has less custom stat blocks than some of the other factions, so you’ll be
mostly relying on the encounter table and shade versions of natural
critters. Still, the custom stat blocks we do get are fun, and it looks like
Clariburnus is a genuine Forgotten Realms big shot who would probably get an
epic-level stat block in a more traditional FR setting book. I love it that he’s
“within reach” of a heroic-tier party here. His stats make for a very
interesting fight, though you should also give him an honor guard.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the Neverwinter Campaign Setting: Netherese</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned several times in this Let’s Read already, Netheril was a human
empire who ruled over most of the world around three thousand years before our
narrative present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their understanding of magic reached levels never seen before or since, but they
fell literally overnight when one of their top archmages tried to cast a spell
that was supposed to make him into a god but instead irreversibly fucked up
Toril’s magic. This caused the vast majority of the flying islands where these
archmages lived to plummet to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such island managed to avoid this fate when its inhabitants plane-shifted it
into the Shadowfell (known as the Plane of Shadow back then). They stayed there
until the end of Second Edition, when they started coming back into the world,
mutated by their millenia in darkness and with a desire to rebuild their former
empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shadow-people are known as Shadovar, but they also consider themselves to
be Netherese and the book uses the two terms interchangeably. There’s a group of
them hiding in the Neverwinter Wood, led by a mage named Clariburnus Tanthul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shadovar have a single major goal in this region: to repair the fallen
island of Xinlenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xinlenal was the first Netherese flying island ever built, the crowning
achievement of the ancient archmage Iolaum, who discovered the technique to
making them. Making it fly again would raise the flag of Netherese dominance
over the whole region, and it would become their greatest center of power in the
entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to fixing Xinlenal is to repair its &lt;em&gt;mythallar&lt;/em&gt;, a magical engine that
looks like a giant crystal sphere and shines like a contained sun. It shattered
when the city fell, and Shadovar artificers are hard at work repairing it as the
campaign starts. The process requires immense quantities of Residuum, and the
easiest way to produce Residuum is to destroy magic items. The older and more
powerful, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means Shadovar agents are scouring the entire region looking for ancient
ruins and the magical relics they contain. The ruined cities of Illefarn, the
crumbling outposts of Delzoun, even the burial mounds of Uthgardt heroes: all of
these are fair game, and anyone who would object to their plundering is an
enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even these ancient ruins might yield enough residuum for their purposes,
though. They’ve started looking at less-old places too. As the campaign starts
that’s still mostly consists of clashing with and looting the bodies of Thayan
and Ashmadai goons, but they could soon move up to plundering Neverwinter
itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Caliburnus’ secondary goals include discovering the fate of Iolaum. Sure,
the wizard lived thousands of years ago and was on Xinlenal when it fell, but
surely one of the bestest mages from the bestest magical empire ever wouldn’t
let little details like that kill him, would it? Imagine what he could do for
the Shadovar cause if he’s brought on-board!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other secondary goal is to pursue their war with Thay. There’s only room for
&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; world-spanning fascist mage empire in this planet, after all. The Shadovar
regularly attack the Thayan base in the Dread Ring, and they’ve also managed to
park one of their flying fortresses above the Thayan city of Surcross, which
they bombard regularly. In case you don’t remember, that’s one of the possible
locations where Valindra might have hidden her soul vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, further down the list, there’s the handling of the Gray Wolf
Uthgardt tribe. The Shadovar recruited them into their service with appeals to
their “ancient Netherese heritage” and gave them the mission to infiltrate and
eventually conquer Helm’s Hold. So far the werewolves have managed to place
several agents in the town, who are busy sowing unrest and generally making it
ready for a takeover. Their progress is slow but in Caliburnus’ view the tribe’s
main purpose is to act as a red herring when people start trying to investigate
Netherese activities. In the meantime, Gray Wolf warriors also get used as
muscle when the need for it arises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;player-tie-ins&quot;&gt;Player Tie-Ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherese seems to be the major faction with the most explicit tie-ins to PC
backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scion of Shadow, of course, starts the game in direct conflict with
them. They have enough information to begin opposing the faction right away, and
especially bold Scions might think to pretend to be loyal in order to infiltrate
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their rampant plundering of ancient ruins also places them in direct opposition
to the Iliyanbruen Guardian, Heir of Delzoun, and the Uthgardt Barbarian. The
book says they are definitely guilty of stealing those eladrin relics, but it’s
less definitive about their role in plundering the Uthgardt barrow - that could
have been the Thayans depending on what the GM desires. Even so, their control
of the Gray Wolves will still make them cross paths with both the Barbarian and
the Pack Outcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherese don’t care about &lt;strong&gt;New Neverwinter&lt;/strong&gt; at all, though that will
change a bit when they start targeting the city for its magic items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are completely ignorant of the &lt;strong&gt;Abolethic Sovereignity&lt;/strong&gt;. Some of their
officials suspect there’s something funky going on beneath Neverwinter and have
sent agents to investigate, but they’re only going to bother Caliburnus about
this when those agents return with answers. This makes the fact that they’re
trying to conquer Helm’s Hold particularly funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They see the &lt;strong&gt;Ashmadai&lt;/strong&gt; as nothing more than minions of the Thayans and have
no idea the cult has plans of its own. The &lt;strong&gt;Thayans&lt;/strong&gt; of course are their
greatest enemies in the region and the Shadovar devote as many resources to
fighting them as they do to restoring Xinlenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have some important links to minor factions, as mentioned above. Their
hold over the Gray Wolves means they will have to deal with the other &lt;strong&gt;Uthgardt
Tribes&lt;/strong&gt; eventually, and the &lt;strong&gt;fey of Iliyanbruen&lt;/strong&gt; are the primary targets of
their relic raids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Netherese are a bit less cognizant of the other factions than I
expected, their plans are appropriately ambitious and they have a real shot at
success barring PC intervention. They also have a bunch of strong ties to
several PC themes, so they’re very likely to feature in your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
