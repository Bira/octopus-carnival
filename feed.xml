&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud rays look like gigantic flying stingrays, and are among some of the rarest
and most majestic specimens of Athasian fauna. They float in from the Sea of
Silt to feed or rest, and despite their prodigious size they’re rarely dangerous
unless bothered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures subsist mostly on psychic, entropic, and magical energy, so they
only need a comparatively tiny amount of physical food to keep going. They land
on the ground to sleep, covering themselves in sand and debris for
camouflage. There are many stories about travelers who pitched their tents on a
nice spot of high ground only to later find themselves desperately clinging to
the back of a cloud ray when the creature took flight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud rays dream of distant places when they sleep, and sometimes they disappear
to those places instead of taking flight the usual way. When threatened, the
creature can consciously tap into this ability to teleport short distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud Rays are Elemental Beasts, whose size varies depending on their age. They
can crawl on the ground at speed 4 and fly at Speed 12 with Hover
capability. They have an affinity for storms, with Resist 15 Lightning and
Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going through the entries here in increasing order of level, which is the
reverse of what the book does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloud-ray-pup&quot;&gt;Cloud Ray Pup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This young individual is Large, translucent, and relatively delicate for its
size. It’s a Level 21 Minion Skirmisher. Pups fly around in clusters near other
creatures that can provide them with food - most commonly cloud ray elders, but
sometimes other aerial predators that tend to leave lots of left-overs. If their
intended prey is still moving, they sting it until it stops, and then set down
to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;sting&lt;/strong&gt; is Reach 3 and deals thunder damage. They can employ it as part
of a &lt;strong&gt;Gliding Attack&lt;/strong&gt; that lets them move their speed and make the attack at
any point along the way. They don’t provoke opportunity attacks when moving away
from the target of their sting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minion, a single hit will take the pup down, but it can use &lt;strong&gt;Dream
Resurgence&lt;/strong&gt; once per encounter to remove itself from play when it reaches 0 HP
and reappear at the start of its next turn within 10 squares, with its 1 HP
restored. It will probably use this opportunity to run away if nothing is
forcing it to stay, so the PCs don’t need to feel bad about giving this
beautiful creature a good whack to get it to bother someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloud-ray-adult&quot;&gt;Cloud Ray Adult&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adults cruise the skies continuously, only descending to rest or to attack
land-bound prey. Sure, it eats little for its size, but for a Huge creature that
can still mean its infrequent meals consist of a whole person or similarly sized
animal. Adults are Level 23 Elite Skirmishers with 424 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adult has a much stronger version of the pup’s &lt;strong&gt;Sting&lt;/strong&gt;, with Reach 4. It
can also use a Reach 1 &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; that deals more damage and grabs the
target. Targets grabbed by the bite have a -4 to their escape rolls, which have
escape DCs of 34 for Athletics and 36 for Acrobatics. The ray can grab at most
one target like this. The &lt;strong&gt;Unhindered&lt;/strong&gt; trait lets the cloud ray pull the
victim along when it moves. Either of these attacks can be used as part of
&lt;strong&gt;Gliding Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets it attack twice during the movement and otherwise
works like the pup’s version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ray that finds itself surrounded can use &lt;strong&gt;Wing Storm&lt;/strong&gt; (Close Burst 3
vs. Fort, recharge 5+) to deal thunder damage and push targets 3 squares on a
hit, also knocking them prone. This creates a lightly obscured zone that lasts
for a turn, from all the dust it kicks up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter, while bloodied, the ray can use &lt;strong&gt;Dream Flight&lt;/strong&gt; to teleport
15 squares, carrying its grabbed victim with it if it has one. It makes Close
Burst 2 attack vs. Fortitude on arrival, dazing an slowing those it hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A grabbed victim can be attacked with further bite attacks and with &lt;strong&gt;Crush&lt;/strong&gt;, a
minor action attack vs. Fortitude that deals as much damage as the bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An adult on the hunt will try to grab its chosen prey and fly away, biting and
crushing the victim until it’s dead. If their prey proves too feisty, they’ll
drop it from a great height to soften it up, and then grab it again. Repeat
until done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloud-ray-elder&quot;&gt;Cloud Ray Elder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This majestic Gargantuan beast is a Level 25 Solo Controller, on par with elder
dragons from other worlds. Its control over storms lets it project an aura (3)
of &lt;strong&gt;Undulating Winds&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals 15 thunder damage to enemies that start
their turns inside and lets the elder slide them 3 squares to another square
within the aura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, its &lt;strong&gt;Flat Body&lt;/strong&gt; lets other creatures enter and occupy the elder’s
space - they’re standing on top of the ray! This means it’s equal parts enemy
and terrain during a fight. If it took flight because you tried to camp on its
back, it will be the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; terrain for the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously if you’re on top of the ray, you’re also inside its aura, so it will
try to slide you off its back. This follows the rules for forced movement into
hazardous terrain, so you get a save to grab on before you tumble to the
ground. If you pass, you end up prone at the ray’s edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The elder’s is Reach 5 &lt;strong&gt;Sting&lt;/strong&gt; deals immediate and ongoing thunder damage
(save ends). Its favorite attack enhances the sting with magic for a &lt;strong&gt;Thunder
Lash&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals physical damage to its primary target and triggers a
secondary close burst 5 centered on that target that deals thunder damage to all
enemies it hits and pushes then 3 squares. On a miss it deals half damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also large enough that its bite upgrades to &lt;strong&gt;Scooping Bite&lt;/strong&gt;: this is a
Close Blast 5 instead of a melee attack, and it can grab up to three targets it
hits. &lt;strong&gt;Unhindered&lt;/strong&gt; is here and lets the elder fly away with its mouthful of
victims. &lt;strong&gt;Gliding Menace&lt;/strong&gt; works like Gliding Attack, but lets the elder
specifically use Thunder Lash and Scooping Bite as its two flyby attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the adult, the elder can &lt;strong&gt;Crush&lt;/strong&gt; its grabbed victims with a minor
action. Fortunately they don’t have penalties on their escape rolls, but the
base DCs are higher since the elder is higher level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If bloodied, the elder uses &lt;strong&gt;Dream Flight&lt;/strong&gt; to teleport away. It works just
like the adult’s version, but the daze upgrades to Stunned on the first failed
save and Unconscious on the second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud Rays are almost always only found together with other cloud rays, with a
flock of pups following a group of adults or a single elder around. They’re not
sapient but I think they’re smart enough not to attack heavily armed PCs without
provocation. Encounters are more likely to start when a PC runs into a ray at
rest, and even then a fight is not certain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine you can have a good adventure about PCs trying to prevent another
armed group from killing cloud rays, and in this case the creatures would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;
be smart enough to distinguish the PCs from the hunters if a fight broke out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cilops (not to be confused with the cyclops) is the Darker and Sunnier
version of Ye Olde Giante Centipede. That means it’s larger, spikier, and has
psychic powers. Their name comes from the huge single mammal-like eye they have
instead of the more usual compound eyes you find in arthropods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other monstrous centipedes, the bite of the cilops is not venomous. The
touch of its antennae, however, can psychically paralyze victims or muddle their
minds. They can also psychically track victims over short distances - it’s very
hard to hide from these things once they caught your scent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wild, cilopses gather in the same places you can find mundane
centipedes - any area where there’s a reasonable amount of shade and
water. You’re more likely to find them &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of the wild, however, as
Templar patrols from every city love to use trained cilopses as both trackers
and attack animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some templars or sorcerer-kings are also fond of raising particularly large and
vicious specimens and letting them loose on the city to wreak some havoc and
terrorize the population into compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cilopses are Large Natural Beasts. They have Darkvision, some sort of antenna
power that varies with the stat block, and the signature power &lt;strong&gt;Follow Psychic
Trail&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a minor-action encounter power that lets them choose a creature
they can see. Until the end of the encounter that creature grants combat
advantage to the cilops, and cannot hide from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combat advantage is pretty useful during a fight, but remember that a skill
challenge to run away from a cilops-equipped patrol is also an encounter. Don’t
let they catch your scent!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cilops-creeper&quot;&gt;Cilops Creeper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical specimen such as one might find in the wild, or accompanying a templar
strike force. It’s a Level 5 Skirmisher with 60 HP. It has ground and climb
speeds of 7, and Resist 5 Psychic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the creeper’s attacks deal 1d6 extra damage if it has &lt;strong&gt;Combat
Advantage&lt;/strong&gt;, which is yet another reason for not letting it track you. Its basic
&lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; damages on a hit and lets the creeper shift 2 squares as an
effect. Once per encounter it can use its &lt;strong&gt;Paralyzing Antennae&lt;/strong&gt; against a
creature granting combat advantage to it, targetting Fortitude. On a hit this
damages, dazes, and immobilizes the target for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creepers really want to start tracking a specific PC as soon as the fight
starts, and then focus fire on their chosen victim starting with an antennae
attack and then proceeding to spam the bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cilops-stalker&quot;&gt;Cilops Stalker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chunky terror weapon, the Stalker is a Level 7 Elite Skirmisher with 154
HP. It’s slower and less agile than the Creeper, with a ground speed of only 6
and no climb speed or psychic resistance. However, it makes up for that in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stalker’s &lt;strong&gt;pincers&lt;/strong&gt; have the same bonus against targets granting CA, and
its &lt;strong&gt;Sudden Rush&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver (recharge 5+) is excellent against tight
formations. It allows the Stalker to shift its speed and move through enemies
space during this shift. Whenever it does so, it makes a melee attack vs. the
enemy’s Reflex, dealing heavy damage and knocking prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can still only &lt;strong&gt;Follow Psychic Trail&lt;/strong&gt; once per encounter, but unlike the
Creeper it can use its Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;Dazing Antennae&lt;/strong&gt; once per round with no
targeting restrictions. This does lightning damage equivalent to the bite on a
hit, and dazes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stalker also wants to track and focus on one target, and Sudden Rush lets it
reach that target even through the party’s defender front line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, you’re much more likely to encounter these things being used
as trackers and attack animals by templars than to meet them in their natural
habitats. If you do meet them in the wild, they’re likely to be accompanied by
other varieties of giant bug, or by swarms of smaller ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, they’re giant centipedes with a bit more character, and I imagine
they can get pretty annoying when paired with other teammates that specialize in
tying PCs down and preventing them from helping the cilops’ chosen victim.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-chathrang.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chathrangs are big carnivorous tortoises with built-in anti-air artillery. The
many spiny protusions on their shells are tubes that can spit out sticky
envenomed quills, with or without a tether that lets them reel in their
catch. Their usual hunting method is to hide in an oasis amid natural reeds or
other plants, wait for small birds or large insects to fly overhead, and shoot
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no suitable flying critters are present, they’ll go for land-based prey. They
tend to become too enthusiastic or desperate at these times, and might try to
reel in something they can’t handle. Like a PC, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chathrangs usually live and travel in groups of about three. They don’t have a
lot of combat ability outside of their one neat trick, so it’s common for them
to enter symbiotic relationships with other creatures to share prey in exchange
for a bit more protection. When hurt, they behave like other tortoises and hide
inside their shells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charthrangs are impossible to train, but some people keep them around to “milk”
their venom. If a battle against their keepers ends up bursting into the
charthrang enclosure, the creatures will follow their instincts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These critters are Medium Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag and a stately
ground speed of 4. They’re Level 9 Artillery with 81 HP, so I guess even a
monster described as “relatively weak” rates high-Heroic stats in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature’s &lt;strong&gt;Spiny Shell&lt;/strong&gt; acts as an aura (1) that deals 5 damage to anyone
who starts their turn inside, but they charthrang doesn’t really want PCs to get
that close. Instead, it wants to stay far away and shoot its Range 20 &lt;strong&gt;spine
shots&lt;/strong&gt;, which do poison damage on a hit. The beast can increase its rate of
fire and use a &lt;strong&gt;Spine Volley&lt;/strong&gt; instead, attacking two targets with one action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaching a sticky strand to a spine turns it into the &lt;strong&gt;Poisoned Tether&lt;/strong&gt;
attack, which does the same damage and immobilizes the target. While immobilized
by this attack, the target cannot be pushed, pulled, or slid by anything other
than the &lt;strong&gt;Reel In&lt;/strong&gt; minor action, which pulls it 5 squares. Escape requires
either passing a save as normal, or teleporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the charthrang is damaged by an attack, it can &lt;strong&gt;retreat into its shell&lt;/strong&gt; as
a reaction. Until the end of its next turn it’s slowed, can’t attack, gains a +5
to AC, and doubles the damage done by its aura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the standard encounter disposition mentioned in the lore, chatharangs
are also very amenable to reskinning. If you read the Cactus entry and felt that
you needed cactus artillery to complement the lurkers, you can just replace
Reptile with Plant on the chathrang stat block and call it a day. Describe them
as big spherical cacti that move by rolling around and otherwise behave the
same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanics are interesting. Range 20 is a lot! A cluster of three of these
machine-gun tortoises can sit very far back behind a line of 2-4 soldiers or
brutes and wreak havoc on the PCs by directly targeting their squishies, and
reeling them towards Team Monster’s frontline. Multiple charthrangs can stick
their tethers to the same PC and alternate their use of Reel In to bring the
victim closer that much faster, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, of course, if the GM plays them smart. This is absolutely not required,
as these are simple animals with a reputation for trying to catch things too
dangerous for them to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still… anti-air tortoises. What a world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cacti are an important part of the Athasian ecosystem, and their natural water
collection mechanisms are often vital to allow people to survive in its
deserts. But in Dark Sun, sometimes the cactus drinks you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry presents two D&amp;amp;D Plant Monsters with that Darker and Sunnier edge to
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zombie-cactus&quot;&gt;Zombie Cactus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most prized cactus species in Athas is the Flowering Oasis Cactus, a
beautiful plant whose sweet fruit can instantly satisfy someone’s hunger or
thirst. Finding one of those out in the desert can be a real lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zombie Cactus takes advantage of this by looking exactly like a Flowering
Oasis Cactus to draw its victims in. Its fruit is just as sweet, but it’s filled
with mind-affecting poison nectar that dominates those who eat it. If the victim
is too wary to eat, the cactus can release a cloud of spores that has the same
effect before uncoiling its tendrils to deal with anyone still free. People
killed while under the cactus’ influence immediately raise as zombie cactus
thralls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is way too evil to be a coincidence. Sages believe zombie cacti are
an engineered bioweapon, the work of slavers employing psychic powers and
defiling magic. The creatures proved too uncontrollable to be used as tools, and
enough escaped their creators to take root in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zombie Cacti are Large Natural Magical Beasts with the Plant tag. Yes, they’re
intelligent. They’re also Level 11 Elite Lurkers with 182 HP, Tremorsense 10,
and a ground speed of 2 with Earth Walk. Yes, they’re ambulatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll usually find the cactus in its &lt;strong&gt;Innocuous Form&lt;/strong&gt;, which is nearly
identical to a flowering oasis cactus (Nature DC 27 to notice the
difference). It can do nothing in this state except assume its true form as a
minor action. While disguised, the cactus has Resist 15 all and
Regeneration 5. Wearing the disguise again takes a standard action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A disguised cactus is still dangerous because of its &lt;strong&gt;Poison Fruit&lt;/strong&gt;, described
as a passive trait. It will have between four and eight of these, which can be
eaten by another character as a minor action. Anyone who eats them is dominated
by the cactus (save ends). A dominated victim who is reduced to 0 HP can no
longer save against this. Note there’s no attack roll here - eat the fruit, get
dominated, period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the jig is up, the cactus uncoils and releases a cloud of &lt;strong&gt;Dominating
Spores&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 3 vs. will), which has the same effect as the fruit on a
hit. The burst also creates a spore-filled zone that inflicts -5 to saves
against zombie cactus domination for a turn. This power recharges when the
cactus uses Innocuous Form, giving us our “lurker loop” (breathe out, breathe
in).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once enough people are dominated, the cactus will use its &lt;strong&gt;Tendrils&lt;/strong&gt;, which do
standard damage and an additional ongoing 10 necrotic (save ends) if the target
is dominated by the cactus. &lt;strong&gt;Lashing Tendrils&lt;/strong&gt; lets it attack two different
targets with this attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone dominated by the cactus dies, they become a Zombie Cactus Thrall at
the start of their next turn. This zombie is a Level 11 Minion Brute. It can
&lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Grab&lt;/strong&gt; for the same amount of damage, but it prefers the later
because it can pull grabbed targets along with itself when it moves (probably
closer to the cactus). When it drops to 0 HP, it releases a &lt;strong&gt;Spore Burst&lt;/strong&gt; in a
Close Burst 1 that has the same attack bonus and effects as the cactus’ cloud!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs want to resurrect a victim of the cactus, they must destroy the
corresponding thrall first. After that, the usual rituals can be applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hunter-cactus&quot;&gt;Hunter Cactus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t engineered bioweapons. They’re “merely” fast, aggressive predators
that pose as innocent plants and use their venomous spines to drain the blood of
their prey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Hunter Cactus is a Large Natural Magical Beast with the Plant tag, and a Level
12 Lurker with 82 HP. It has Tremorsense 20 and a ground speed of &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the hunter cactus stands still, it takes a DC28 Nature check to realize
it’s not a mundane plant. It will probably begin its attack with a &lt;strong&gt;Spine
Burst&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 3 vs. Reflex, recharge 5+). It deals no damage right away,
but inflicts 20 ongoing poison damage and blindness (save ends both)! From then
on it will use its &lt;strong&gt;Feeding Spine&lt;/strong&gt; on any blinded creatures, damaging and
grabbing them on a hit. It can grab up to two creatures this way. A minor action
lets it sustain all grabs and auto-damage the grabbed creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the cactus cannot run away with grabbed creatures, so it will stand
its ground and fight any remaining foes with &lt;strong&gt;Slams&lt;/strong&gt; that deal standard damage
and ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends). If the cactus is hit while it has a
creature grabbed, the &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Feedback&lt;/strong&gt; reaction deals psychic damage to the
victim equal to the damage the cactus just took.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zombie cacti are found in the wild alone or in pairs, surrounded by thralls who
rise up to fight when the cactus reveals itself. Note they are &lt;em&gt;magical beasts&lt;/em&gt;,
and therefore capable of forming alliances with other creatures. Commonly, that
will be a wild predator who they train to draw victims to the cactus so they can
share the spoils. Sometimes other people will coerce a zombie cactus into
service, a fate it will always try to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter cacti are more amenable to cooperation with humanoids, who can easily
train them to attack only designated targets in exchange for a regular supply of
food. In these cases they will be found alongside other guardians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are neat, and very nasty. Cactus drinks you indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry goes on and on about how stupid brohgs are, but I think that’s
terribly unfair to them. They’re some of the nicest people we’ve met in this
reading so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four-armed giant-kin wander the wastes in small nomadic bands that
occasionally cross paths to trade gossip and partners. They’re extremely skilled
at surviving the environment in Athas, taking only what they need and leaving
little trace of their passage. Their strong primal magic tradition helps them
with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, being both big and relatively peaceful makes them frequent targets
for the many odious slaver organizations in this setting, so they often end up
captured and put to work as heavy laborers, muscle, or gladiators. Enslaved
brohg who manage to break free often seek employment as mercenaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brohgs have both an innate ability to sense arcane magic, and an intense
cultural distrust of it, as they associate all arcane magic with defiling and
believe it to be cursed. Very rarely, a brohg will be born with innate arcane
potential (like a PC sorcerer). These individuals end up exiled from their
communities, as they’re believed to be hosts to “evil spirits” and destined to
bring disaster. Left to fend for themselves with no support, they often end up
creating a self-fulfilling prophecy scenario and becoming cruel defilers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brohgs are Large Natural Humanoids with the Giant tag. They move at a relatively
slow speed of 6, and have low-light vision. They have four arms and are
ambidexterous, but that doesn’t translate into a specific trait in their stat
blocks - each one has different abilities related to training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brohg-hurler&quot;&gt;Brohg Hurler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurlers are civilians without a lot of combat training, but they get by just
fine by throwing stuff really far away, be that stuff boulders or
enemies. They’re Level 10 Artillery with 82 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; attack lets them grab the target on a hit, which is
hilarious because they can then use &lt;strong&gt;Hurl Away&lt;/strong&gt; to throw them 10 squares at
another creature, further damaging the “ammunition” as an effect and making a
ranged attack against the second target. For rules purposes, this counts as a
push that leaves the hurled creature adjacent to the second target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no one’s stupid enough to get within arm’s reach of a hurler, they can hurl a
&lt;strong&gt;rock&lt;/strong&gt; instead, which does similar damage, pushes the target 2 squares, and
knocks it prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brohg-warrior&quot;&gt;Brohg Warrior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what a trained brohg combatant looks like. When a brohg community is
under attack, warriors step up to cover their retreat. This could also represent
an enslaved or mercenary brohg working for someone else. Warriors are armed with
2 spears, a shield, and a hand kept free to throw rocks. They’re Level 10 Elite
Soldiers with 212 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can attack with a &lt;strong&gt;spear&lt;/strong&gt; that marks for a turn or a thrown &lt;strong&gt;rock&lt;/strong&gt; that
knocks prone, and &lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt; lets them do that twice in an action in any
combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Brohg Taunt&lt;/strong&gt; ability is a minor action that lets them mark everyone in
a Close Burst 2, and recharges when they’re bloodied. If a marked enemy within 2
squares moves, the brohg can use &lt;strong&gt;Battle Alacrity&lt;/strong&gt; to get a free attack on
them that does light damage and lets then shift 1 square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brohg-renegade&quot;&gt;Brohg Renegade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those banished sorcerers who went all in on defiling magic, and now
wanders alone or at the head of a villainous band, plotting to increase his
power. The Renegade is a Level 13 Solo Controller with 512 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defiler knows an &lt;strong&gt;Arcane Secret&lt;/strong&gt; that lets them roll saves against daze
or stun effects both at the start and end of its turn, even if that effect
doesn’t allow a save (i.e., by having a fixed duration instead). Its &lt;strong&gt;dagger&lt;/strong&gt;
basic attack is a &lt;em&gt;minor&lt;/em&gt; action that does normal damage, and a little bit of
extra force damage if the target doesn’t end their next turn at least two
squares away from the renegade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its standard actions are all spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entropy Belt&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10 vs. will) targets one to three creatures, dealing
psychic damage and pushing 3 squares on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defiling Vortex&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 3 vs. Fort, recharges when bloodied) deals no
damage on a hit, but instead knocks targets prone and weakens then (save
ends). Missed enemies take necrotic damage. At the end of all this, the
renegade gains 5 temp HP for every target it hit with the power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defiling Blast&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Ref, recharge 5+) does necrotic damage
and dazes (save ends). The renegade gains a +4 to all damage while any target
remains dazed by this power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as it suits a solo, we also get a ton of triggered actions. The renegade has
the same &lt;strong&gt;Variable Resistance&lt;/strong&gt; as a demon, usable 2 times per encounter. To
refresh our memories: the value of this resistance is 10, and when the renegade
takes elemental damage it can switch the resistance to resist that damage type
as a free action, up to the encounter limit, when the resistance retains its
final type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an enemy hits the renegade while granting combat advantage to it, the
renegade can cast a &lt;strong&gt;Wrath Sphere&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 1 vs. Fort) against that
enemy, dealing force damage and pushing it 2 squares on a hit. And when the
renegade is first bloodied, &lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Defiling&lt;/strong&gt; triggers to let it immediately
recharge and use Defiling Blast again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of stuff, but that’s a solo for you. Almost dragon-like, this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free broghs have no reason to quarrel with PCs unless provoked, and if that
happens the warriors will cover the retreat of the rest of the group while
hurlers help from further away. They might also keep several of the hardy beasts
described in this book, and they might help in a fight too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enslaved or mercenary individuals might be found in mixed sapient encounter
groups. Renegade defilers will often be &lt;em&gt;leading&lt;/em&gt; such a villain group. A single
renegade is a nice “welcome to paragon tier” boss fight. One plus some
lieutenants makes for a nice set piece battle for mid-paragon heroes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like their mechanics and I like parts of their lore, but as I already
mentioned I don’t like the way the book keeps saying how brohgs are stupid and
simple-minded, and how it manages to make them superstitious despite living in a
D&amp;amp;D world and having their own working magical tradition. Distrusting arcane
magic in Dark Sun is sensible, but having the brohgs do it because they falsely
believe it’s a curse from evil spirits is a step too far in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braxats used to be natural beasts long ago, but according to the book were
uplifted by a “grim magical influence” over centuries of exposure to become the
huge and extremely antisocial insectile/reptilian humanoids they are today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braxats view all relationships, including those with other braxats, in terms of
dominance and coercion. They treat anyone weaker than them with contempt at
best, viciously hate anyone they see as equals, and only grudginly submit to
those they perceive as stronger. Each group is smaller than the one before, of
course. They have a particularly hate for half-giants for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes one of Athas’ many shady organizations manages to convince young
braxats to work for them as muscle through either bribery or intimidation. This
never lasts long, as the creatures are incapable of forming true loyalties and
either leave or betray their bosses if they survive and grow strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same emphasis on coercion also applies to braxat reproduction
(yikes!). Braxats reproduce when there’s enough surplus food to go around, and
lay their eggs in secluded caves and other similar shelters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braxats are Natural Humanoids, with young specimens starting at Large and adults
reaching Huge size. They have Speed 8, acid resistance that increases with tier,
low-light vision, and the &lt;strong&gt;Threatening Reach&lt;/strong&gt; trait, which means they can make
opportunity attacks against anyone inside their full melee reach, not just
adjacent enemies. They rely on their carapace for protection and use their fists
or heavy clubs as weapons. They can also spit acid and use psychic powers,
though the exact mechanics vary on each stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;braxat-juvenile&quot;&gt;Braxat Juvenile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A still-young individual that’s nevertheless old and large enough to strike out
on its own. As mentioned above, some juveniles are conditioned from an early age
to view another creature as its superior, but that only lasts until the braxat
grows large and smart enough to see it’s stronger. Mercenary arrangements tend
to last a bit more. Many juveniles never grow to see adulthood, dying during
their work as muscle for Athas’ various villainous organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juveniles are Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They’re “merely” size Large, and have
Acid Resistance 10. Their melee attacks are reach 2 and consist of either a
basic &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; that marks for a turn on a hit, or a &lt;strong&gt;Thrash&lt;/strong&gt; ability that does
the same damage and knocks prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At range, they can use their &lt;strong&gt;Caustic Spit&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5 vs. Reflex) to deal
immediate and ongoing acid damage, also slowing the target (save ends
both). When a marked enemy within 3 squares tries to move away from the
juvenile, they can use a &lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic Barrier&lt;/strong&gt; as an interrupt to slide the
enemy back towards a square adjacent to the braxat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;braxat-raider&quot;&gt;Braxat Raider&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical adult specimen, now grown to Huge size. It wanders the wastes alone or
with a small band of followers, setting up camp near caravan routes or villages
that they periodically raid for livestock and people to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raiders are Level 14 Elite Soldiers with 280 HP. Their melee reach is 3, and
their acid resistance is 15. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;greatclubs&lt;/strong&gt; whose basic attacks
damage and slide 1 square on a hit, and mark for a turn as an effect. They can
also be used for &lt;strong&gt;Greatclub Sweeps&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) that target a Close Burst 2
and knock prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raider’s acid spit is a &lt;strong&gt;Scathing Spray&lt;/strong&gt; (Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex,
recharges when first bloodied) that has similar effects to the juvenile’s spit
on anyone it hits, and does half damage on a miss. Its TK barrier evolves to
&lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic Harness&lt;/strong&gt; (immediate reaction), letting it pull marked enemies
that end their turns not adjacen to the raider up to 6 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also get an entirely new psychic power: &lt;strong&gt;Agonize&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10 vs. will)
deals psychic damage and slows for a turn, and doesn’t provoke opportunity
attacks when used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;braxat-lord&quot;&gt;Braxat Lord&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braxats who live to reach the peak of their power are strong enough to set
themselves up as regional despots, as only the most powerful creatures in Athas
can hope to win against them. They view pretty much anyone else as either
potential slaves, or potential meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Braxat Lord is a Level 23 Elite Soldier with 428 HP and 20 acid
resistance. Like the Raider, it’s Huge and its melee reach is 3. It fights with
a &lt;strong&gt;Maul&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and slides 2 squares on a hit, and marks for a turn as
an effect. It can attack at range with the &lt;strong&gt;Crushing Pain&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10
vs. Fort) psychic power, which deals psychic damage, immobilizes for a turn, and
slows for another turn as an aftereffect. The &lt;strong&gt;Attack Flurry&lt;/strong&gt; power lets it
use the maul twice and Crushing Pain once in the same standard action, against 2
or 3 targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its acid spit power is &lt;strong&gt;Vitriolic Spew&lt;/strong&gt;, a Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex that deals
immediate and ongoing acid damage. It also turns the blast area into lightly
obscured difficult terrain that deals acid damage to anyone ending their turn
inside, and lasts until the end of the lord’s next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The psychic powers don’t end there either! &lt;strong&gt;Overawe&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) is a minor
action Close Burst 10 that targets all creatures marked by the lord, deals
psychic damage, makes them grant combat advantage, and forbids them from using
opportunity or immediate actions (save ends both). And its &lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic
Harness&lt;/strong&gt; works like the raider’s but also restrains those pulled by it and
deals ongoing psychic damage (save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the encounter examples are pretty well described above. As for my
impressions, braxats seem to be some of the worst people in Athas, and that’s
saying something. They feel like Darker and Sunnier evil ogres or giants. The
three variants slot neatly into the ogre/giant/titan role, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do fey look like in a world whose environment as deeply fucked up as
Athas’? Let’s check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Belgoi (singular and plural are the same) lived in the Feywild before it was
destroyed in ancient Athasian history, and they weren’t the most pleasant of fey
back them. They took refuge in the world, but eventually came to hate it and all
its residents. Now they live to despoil everything they touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belgoi organize into small nomadic tribes led by the strongest member. They’ll
stop at a location and live there for a while, moving on when everything around
them is ruined, consumed, or polluted. They often go out hunting, and will eat
anything and anyone they can catch. They prefer sapient victims because they
think meat tastes better when seasoned with terror, and that eating someone lets
them absorb the victim’s power. That’s why they also eat their own dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eladrin are their preferred victims, since the belgoi blame them for the
destruction of their homelands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belgoi wear leather or hide armor, which I guess is true of most fighters on
Athas. They fight with claw or spear, and wield small bells which they use to
channel their magic. Ringing the bell allows them to lure targets closer for the
kill, isolating them from their peers and breaking their formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me think their name is a horrible pun (belgoi == “bell guy”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of them have the ability to drain a victim’s life force through the wounds
they inflict. You can see it seeping out and flowing into the creature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belgois are Medium Fey Humanoids with Speed 6 and Low-Light Vision. They speak
Common, and all of the stat blocks here are Chaotic Evil. Their signature trait
is that they’re &lt;strong&gt;Hungry For Blood&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes all their attacks deal extra
damage against bloodied targets. All of them also have a bell-related power,
which is a little different for each variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;belgoi-craven&quot;&gt;Belgoi Craven&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weakest and most cowardly of their number, hiding behind more powerful
warriors and waiting for the chance to pounce upon weak or isolated enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are Level 7 Minion Skirmishers, whose &lt;strong&gt;Craven Slink&lt;/strong&gt; gives them a +2
bonus to all defenses when adjacent to an ally (even another craven). Their
&lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; is a standard minion basic attack, and their &lt;strong&gt;Compelling Ring&lt;/strong&gt;
(ranged 10 vs. Will, Encounter) can slide the target 5 squares to a square
adjacent to the craven or one of their allies. Dangerous when the more powerful
variants are around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;belgoi-stalker&quot;&gt;Belgoi Stalker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every belgoi belongs to a tribe. Stalkers usually travel alone, but can
sometimes join up with mixed humanoid bands that have similar inclinations. They
will also opportunistically insert themselves into ongoing fights, trying to
lure a victim out while they’re busy with other enemies. And you can also just
say a given stalker is with a tribe too, of course. They’re Level 7 Lurkers with
63 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalkers will star the fight at a distance, and use the &lt;strong&gt;Enticing Ring&lt;/strong&gt;
(Ranged 10 vs. Will) of their bells to lure a target. On a hit the target is
pulled 5 squares and dazed for a turn. The stalker then moves up and uses its
basic &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack, which deals light physical damage and ongoing 5 damage
(save ends). If the target is dazed, like they would be in this scenario, the
ongoing damage is increased to 15 and the &lt;em&gt;Stalker&lt;/em&gt; takes a -5 penalty to its
defenses until the start of its next turn, giving it an incentive to stay
away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;belgoi-hunter&quot;&gt;Belgoi Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunters are the main frontline units of a Belgoi attack, engaging enemies
directly with their spears and trying to make them vulnerable to the attacks of
their sneakier fellows. They’re Level 8 Soldiers with 89 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunters fight with their &lt;strong&gt;spears&lt;/strong&gt;, but instead of charging into the fray
they’ll try to draw enemies to them with the &lt;strong&gt;Ringing Attraction&lt;/strong&gt; of their
bells. This minor action power attacks the Will of all enemies in a Close
Burst 5. On a hit, the hunter pulls the target 3 squares and marks it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hunter can then use its &lt;strong&gt;Stakeout&lt;/strong&gt; attack against an enemy it has marked,
which deals the same damage as the basic spear strike and immobilizes the target
for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This set of powers is perfect for a tactic where hunters get the party’s
defenders out of position so a large horde of cravens or a stalker can slip
through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;belgoi-caller&quot;&gt;Belgoi Caller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Callers usually lead belgoi tribes and hunting bands. They’re visibly more
powerful than their followers, and have access to stronger magic and psychic
powers that help their allies and hinder their foes. Not every hunting band will
have a caller in it, but when they show up they’re bad news. Callers are Level 8
Elite Controllers with the Leader tag and 178 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can fight with &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; that damage and inflict ongoing 5 damage (save
ends), but their actions are better spent on their &lt;strong&gt;Ennui Lash&lt;/strong&gt; power (minor
action, melee 3 vs. Will), which does equivalent psychic damage and inflicts a
-2 penalty to Will for a turn. That opens the enemy up to their bigger powers,
and to the psychic attacks of their buddies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first big power is &lt;strong&gt;Command of the Bell&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 10 vs. Will, recharge
4+), which deals psychic damage, slides the target 3 squares, and forces them to
make an at-will attack against an ally of the caller’s choice. Not a basic
attack, an &lt;em&gt;at-will&lt;/em&gt; attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other big power is &lt;strong&gt;Distant Ringing&lt;/strong&gt; (area burst 3 within 10 vs. Will,
recharge when first bloodied), which deals psychic damage to enemies caught
inside and pulls them towards the center of the burst. Allies caught inside can
shift 1 square and roll a save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encounters with groups of belgoi are pretty similar to the ones described for
the lone stalker above. They creep around the party trying to stay undetected
until their targets are vulnerable or engaged in another fight, try to lure and
kill as many victims as they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ll use clever ambush tactics and take advantage of terrain as much as
possible, but don’t seem to like surrendering or talking. They always begin with
the ambush, and run away if things don’t go their way, possibly to return later
for revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like their mechanics, but I’ll admit I can’t get over the pun. Bell
guys. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athas has no mundane Earth animals. Instead of wolves or dogs, you get these
things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baazrags are beetle-lizard things the size of large dogs. In their natural
environment, they’re desert predators organized in large but loose packs. Pack
members stick close to each other but most fend for themselves, feeding on weeds
and small animals and accumulating water in a sac under their shell. When one of
them detects large prey it alerts the others, and the entire pack works together
for the big meal ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All baazrags are born female, but only a few manage to reach the right size,
age, and biochemical triggers to become egg-laying breeders. When a breeder is
present, some of the other baazrags will become male, and will help fertilize
and defend the eggs. Breeders and other powerful baazrags have some innate
psychic sensitivity - proximity to psychic characters irritates them, making
them more hostile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bazraags are Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag. Like most monster tags, it
does nothing by itself but some effects may key off it. Most specimens are
Medium, but Whelps are Small and breeders are Large. Their signature trait is
&lt;strong&gt;Pack Harrier&lt;/strong&gt;, a passive trait which gives them combat advantage against any
target surrounded by two or more of their allies. They have a ground speed of 8,
so good lock outrunning them when they find you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;baazrag-whelp&quot;&gt;Baazrag Whelp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baazrags are capable of fighting from the moment they hatch, but they’re still
too vulnerable to strike out on their own and so stick close to their
mother. When they grow up a little more, they join the other members of the pack
in their semi-independent activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whelps are Level 1 Minion Skirmishers with the signature traits mentioned above,
plus the &lt;strong&gt;Scrambler&lt;/strong&gt; trait that lets them ignore difficult terrain when they
shift. Their &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; does the kind of damage you’d expect from a Level 1
Minion, which isn’t anything spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;baazrag-gnawer&quot;&gt;Baazrag Gnawer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particularly tenacious hunter that strays a bit further from the pack to act
as a scout. It’s usually the first to spot large prey and warn its companions,
and when it bites down it doesn’t let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gnawers are Level 1 Skirmishers with 29 HP and all the standard traits. It also
has the &lt;strong&gt;Latcher&lt;/strong&gt; trait, which gives it +2 AC when it’s latched onto a victim
(see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gnawer’s &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; does a lot of work here. It deals standard damage on a hit
and lets the creature latch onto the target, which works like a custom status
effect. While the gnawer is latched on a target, it moves when the target moves,
without provoking opportunity attacks, and can stop at any unoccupied square
adjacent to the target at the destination. It can obviously only latch onto one
creature at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the gnawer is latched, it can use the &lt;strong&gt;Gnaw&lt;/strong&gt; attack, which on a hit
deals heavy physical damage, ongoing 5 poison (save ends) and lets the creature
detach and shift 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between having a gnawer attached and being grabbed is that
the target is not immobilized. Therefore, even though the stat block doesn’t say
it, I’d let PCs treat it like a grab for purposes of escaping it early. On the
other hand, while a gnawer can only grab one target, &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; gnawers can
attach to the same target. Don’t let it happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as a move action, the gnawer can use &lt;strong&gt;Bounder&lt;/strong&gt; to jump 4 squares
without provoking opportunity attacks. This is at-will, so it’s a very slippery
creature if you don’t have a fighter with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;baazrag-swarm&quot;&gt;Baazrag Swarm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One whelp is nearly harmless, but the whole litter at once is bad news. This
is a Medium swarm, counting as a Level 3 Soldier with 46 HP. They have the usual
swarm resistances: half damage from melee and ranged attacks, vulnerable 5
against close and area attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all Swarms, this one can occupy the same space as its enemies, and its area
counts as difficult terrain. It cannot be pushed, pulled or slid by melee or
ranged attacks, and can squeeze past any opening big enough for an individual
member without penalty. In this case, the members are probably Small. It also
has Pack Harrier, and a &lt;strong&gt;Hinder&lt;/strong&gt; aura (1) that slows enemies who start their
turns inside. Being inside the swarm also counts as being inside the aura,
obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic melee attack is &lt;strong&gt;Bloodthirsty Swarm&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals extra damage
against prone targets. Their other attack is of course &lt;strong&gt;Pull Down&lt;/strong&gt;, which
damages and knocks prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things are &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; less dangerous &lt;a href=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2020/01/27/drakes.html&quot;&gt;needlefang drake swarms&lt;/a&gt;. They’re
higher level and do more base damage, but their aura doesn’t give them
additional free attacks against prone targets. This means they will probably
leave incapacitated PCs alone while other enemies remain in the map, though
those would still be fair game if nothing else is in reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;baazrag-breeder&quot;&gt;Baazrag Breeder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical baazrag who managed to grow and develop the ability to lay eggs. It’s
Large in size, and a Level 5 Brute with 77 HP. I’m guessing not every old-enough
baazrag will reach this state - it might be something related to hormones, like
in an insect hive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breeder upgrades her Pack Harrier trait to &lt;strong&gt;Pack Master&lt;/strong&gt;, and only needs
one other adjacent ally to gain Combat Advantage against a target. She can
attack with a basic &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack or with a &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; that deals bonus damage
against prone targets and inflicts ongoing 5 poison (save ends) on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also has psychic powers! &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Lure&lt;/strong&gt; is a minor action Close Burst 5
vs. Will that targets one enemy and pulls them 3 squares on a hit. And that
irritability when near other psychic sources translates into the &lt;strong&gt;Psychic
Provocation&lt;/strong&gt; reaction, which lets the breeder immediately charge anyone who
deals psychic damage to her once per turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baazrags look like typical random encounters during wilderness travel, but
depending on how the PCs are doing in their trek they could also seek the
creatures out to harvest their water sacs and meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sign of a baazrag pack is the lone scout that will make an effort to
call its buddies when it finds the party. Then they’ll swarm the prey and try to
pull it down for the kill, but will give up if they think the prey is too tough
and the fight is going against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breeders, if present, stay a bit further away and try to lure a lone victim with
Psychic Lure. If they manage it, they’ll attack the isolated PC with the help of
any nearby young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual adult Baazrags could all be represented by gnawers, though you could
also reskin Gray Wolves from the Monster Vault as other baazrag adults. Any and
all of these might be found as members of humanoid encounter groups as guard and
war animals, just like the beasts they replace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if anakores appeared before. This is the first time I’ve read
about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little is known about the origins of these creatures. Ancient tales speak of a
terror from beyond the sky that touched their humanoid ancestors, causing them
to recoil from the sun and seek shelter underground. Over time, these ancestors
became today’s anakores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anakores live in small hunter-gatherer bands led by their most accomplished
tracker. They burrow beneath the desert sands during the day, and from there
they can feel the vibrations of prey passing overhead, and smell blood spilled
on the ground. When anakores detect prey, they can follow it all day by
tunneling through the sands, waiting until nightfall to spring their ambush from
below. Then they will fight with their powerful digging claws and their
paralytic bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While on the move, the creatures subsist on plant roots, including certain
poisonous species that help the formation of their venom. Rootless vegetation
spread around an area is a possible signt of anakore presence, though they’re
smart enough to clean this up if they intend to stay in place for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different band members specialize in different parts of an attack - some lead
the ambush, others strike to hurt and incapacitate victims, and yet others drag
those victims underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess a lot of the time they prey on the local fauna, but anakores don’t mind
attacking sapient travellers, and judging from what the book says seem to prefer
it. They don’t have any visible sexual dimorphism, and rumor has it that they
reproduce by dragging some of their sapient victims to weird cocoons under the
sands. There, the victims are transformed into more anakores. No one knows what
criteria they use to select new candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anakores are Medium Aberrant Humanoids, which means they’re sapient. They have
low-light vision and Tremorsense 5, plus a ground speed of 5 with Earth Walk and
a burrow speed of 6 on loose earth only. They communicate in Deep Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their signature traits are &lt;strong&gt;Dune Diver&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them charge while
burrowing, and &lt;strong&gt;Sensitive to Light&lt;/strong&gt;, which gives them a -2 penalty to attacks
for a turn when they’re exposed to direct sunlight or take radiant damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their poison is a rider on a different attack on every stat block, but the
effect is always the same: the target is slowed on a hit (save ends), worsening
to immobilized (save ends) after the first failed save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anakore-hunter&quot;&gt;Anakore Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the ones who drag people under. They’re Level 5 Lurkers with 48
HP. Their basic &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; attacks grab the target on a hit, and on their next
turn they can choose to either bite the victim or drag them under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; targets a grabbed creature and deals a bit less damage than the
claws, but applies the poison described above. &lt;strong&gt;Drag Under&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 1
vs. Fortitude) can target either immobilized or grabbed creatures. It deals more
damage than the claw, inflicts 5 ongoing damage and removes the target from play
(save ends both). When the effect ends the target reappears at its previous
position or on the closest unoccupied square. And even them they’re still
immobilized (save ends), so the hunter can try to drag them under again right
away instead of having to bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presumably, victims who drop to 0 HP by this attack would be dragged further
down and not come back up. Don’t let that happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anakore-render&quot;&gt;Anakore Render&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the one that hurts the prey and makes it more vulnerable to the
others. Renders are Level 7 Brutes with 96 HP and a ground speed of 7 instead
of the usual 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; do heavy damage on a hit, pushing the target 2 squares and
knocking it prone. Their &lt;strong&gt;blood frenzy&lt;/strong&gt; ablity (recharge 5+) lets them perform
two of these attacks in one action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a move action, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Blood Hunger&lt;/strong&gt; to shift 3 squares closer to a
bloodied creature. As a minor action, they can use a &lt;strong&gt;rending bite&lt;/strong&gt; against a
prone or bloodied creature, which does light physical damage and applies anakore
venom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anakore-dune-king&quot;&gt;Anakore Dune King&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the leaders of a pack, Dune Kings signal the start of an attack by
bursting up from the ground in the middle of their targets and distracting them
so their fellows can attack the victims more safely. They’re Level 9 Skirmishers
with 94 HP and the Leader tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; damage and apply anakore poison on a hit, but the real threat
here is the &lt;strong&gt;Sand Eruption&lt;/strong&gt; ability (recharge 5+). The dune king must be
underground to start this, and the action lets him move 4 squares to a square
that’s not underground. The first time they enter such a square, they can
perform a Close Burst 2 attack that targets enemies and deals very heavy
physical damage on a hit, sliding the targets 2 squares. Additionally, each
anakore in the burst can shift 3 squares as a free action, and the area of the
burst becomes difficult terrain until the end of the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Dune Kings can shift 1 square as a minor action using &lt;strong&gt;Sand Slide&lt;/strong&gt;,
which makes them as slippery as kobolds despite their size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anakore bands only hunt in places where they can burrow, which means the terrain
on the map will mostly be soft earth, sand, or silt. An anakore-only encounter
is the most common one, I think, but they can also appear with other burrowing
predators that they either trained, or which happen to be opportunistically
hanging around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also work with other sapients that pay them in food and trinkets for
doing what they were already going to do anyway, and you might also find them
in bizarre aberrant ruins on or under the surface, drawn there by strange dreams
and performing unspeakable rituals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anakores are smart enough to recognize when they’re in a poor situation, and
when they should negotiate instead of fighting. But if they think they should
fight, their underground ambushes can be pretty terrifying, as all of their
powers synergize very well and make the tactics described in the lore section
very effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their burrow speed lets them go back underground at will, meaning each Dune King
might be able to perform more than one Sand Eruption in a fight, and the Hunters
can move with relative impunity among the party to harass and grab the
PCs. Renders stay up top once they emerge, and all of them are immune to the
difficult terrain created by the Kings due to Earth Walk.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-aarakocra.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    An aarakocra warrior holding a spear with their feet. Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know Aarakocra first show up on the 1e Fiend Folio as relatively
peaceful and good-natured bird people. They’re like that in most of their
appearances, but just like with all everything else about this setting the
Athasian version is Darker and Sunnier(TM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, Aarakocra are vulture-people, who band together in insular tribes for
survival in the harsh wastelands of Athas. They just want to be left alone to do
their own thing, but are understandably mistrustful of outsiders in a setting
full of slavers and sorcerer-kings. Each tribe claims a territory, and fiercely
defends it. Their settlements are built atop desert mesas and other high places,
and they use these vantage points to survey their territory for food and
intruders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreigners traveling through a tribe’s territory will be approached by the
aarakocra, who demand tribute in exchange for safe passage. Those who pay are
guided to safer paths or useful landmarks. The aarakocra attack those parties
who refuse, trying to kidnap some of their members for ransom. Some large
merchant houses make deals with the more powerful tribes, paying protection fees
in advance to avoid harassment from both the paid off tribe and any weaker ones
that might lie along the route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aarakocra have a long tradition of reverence for primal spirits of the wind and
sun. Many of them display the ability to cast primal spells, and they know
rituals to summon air elementals and other spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aarakocra are Medium Natural Humanoids (take that, Aristotle!). They have
low-light vision, ground speeds of 5, and fly speeds of 6. Their signature power
is &lt;strong&gt;Sly Takeoff&lt;/strong&gt;, a move action that lets them shift 1 square and then fly 5
squares. It’s very useful for disengaging from melee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aarakocra-diver&quot;&gt;Aarakocra Diver&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braver than most of their kin, these warriors like to fly high and dive at their
targets from an angle that leaves the sun at their backs, making it difficult
for the victim to spot them until it’s too late. They’re Level 6 Skirmishers
with 66 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divers fight in the traditional aarakocra style, gripping a Reach 2
&lt;strong&gt;longspear&lt;/strong&gt; in their prehensile feet while flying. “Brave” doesn’t mean
stupid, so they do everything they can to avoid getting bogged down in ground
combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their most likely maneuver is a &lt;strong&gt;Flyby Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, where they can move 6 squares,
and make a longspear attack against a target anywhere along the movement. If the
target grants combat advantage to the diver, the diver can also make a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;
attack as a minor action for a little extra bit of damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also make a more powerful &lt;strong&gt;Diving Charge&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+), which lets
them charge and make an extra strong longspear attack that also knocks prone on
a hit. They’ll likely need to use &lt;strong&gt;Sly Takeoff&lt;/strong&gt; to move away afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aarakocra-warrior&quot;&gt;Aarakocra Warrior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical vulture-folk warrior is not as mobile or brave as the diver, relying
on strength of numbers. They descend from the sky and try to stay just high
enough off the ground to stab with their spears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warriors are Level 6 Minion Skirmishers that fight with reach 1 &lt;strong&gt;Spears&lt;/strong&gt; which
do an extra point of damage on a charge. So they still want to charge in and use
&lt;strong&gt;Sly Takeoff&lt;/strong&gt; to move away when fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aarakocra-windcaller&quot;&gt;Aarakocra Windcaller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priests and mystics trained in the aarakocra primal tradition, they know the
secret spells to command the wind and use it to fight. They’re Level 8
Controllers with the Leader tag and 82 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windcallers really lean into the whole “vulture-folk” thing for DS aarakocra,
since their powers seem to have a &lt;em&gt;stench&lt;/em&gt; theme in addition to a wind
theme. For example, their &lt;strong&gt;Carrion Scent&lt;/strong&gt; (aura 10) let flying allies inside
hover if they have a fly speed, and make them deal +4 damage to bloodied
enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their melee basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Wafting Claw&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and slows (save
ends) in a hit. On the first failed save, the target falls prone. They also have
a ranged basic attack, &lt;strong&gt;Foul Gust&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex) that damages and
slides 3 squares on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In less stinky news, they can also envelop a target in a &lt;strong&gt;Dust Veil&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged
10 vs. Reflex, recharge 4+) that damages and forces the target to treat any
nonadjacent creatures as having concealment (save ends). On the first failed
save, the target is blinded for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter they can also generate an &lt;strong&gt;Instant Whirlwind&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast
5 vs. Fortitude), which damages enemies, slides them 4 squares, and knocks them
prone on a hit. As an effect, it also lets allies inside the blast shift 2
squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters&quot;&gt;Encounters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aarakocra rarely work with other sapients, except maybe for the occasional
cooperation with kenku. They will however follow or lure dangerous predators who
live in their territory towards groups of intruders they want to kill, and then
swoop down to deal with the survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, their traditional ability to summon elementals is still here, now
as an off-screen ritual instead of something that has to happen mid-fight. So
it’s entirely possible for encounters to include elementals or other primal
spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as with any kind of sapient person in this hellish wasteland, they might be
found in the service of the many despots of Athas as enslaved scouts and
soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically I think these are mostly equivalent to traditional aarakocra in
terms of capabilities, but I like that their lore makes them a group PCs are
likely to deal with at some point, instead of putting them atop isolated
mountain ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
