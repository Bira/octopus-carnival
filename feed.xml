  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ogre situation in the Monster Manual 3 is the same as the giant situation:
they first appeared in the Monster Manual 1, and are about to get new and
improved versions of those entries in the Monster Vault. The MM3 contains more
“exotic” variants that will nicely complement the rewritten “basic” ones from
the MV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classic ogres, such as the ones that will show up on the Monster Vault, are
comically stupid brutes. The ones contained in this entry break that stereotype
by being significantly smarter, and capable of sophisticated tactics on the
level of any other humanoid opposition. In other words, the Monster Vault will
Ogre Harder while the Monster Manual 3 will Ogre Smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra brainpower of these ogres doesn’t necessarily make them &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; - the
entries here are still all Chaotic Evil, they’re just smarter about it. Nothing
prevents you from Shreking it up and having ogres that are both smart and
non-evil at your table, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, Ogres are Large Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 8. Everything
else about them varies per stat block, though their abilities tend to be styled
as big smashy strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogre-cave-hunter&quot;&gt;Ogre Cave Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is &lt;em&gt;sneaky&lt;/em&gt;. The Cave Hunter has learned to perform stealthy raids,
evade pursuers, and lure them to ambush spots disguised to look like the ogre’s
home cave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cave Hunters are Level 8 Lurkers with 70 HP. Like typical ogres, they wear hide
and fight with ogre-sized &lt;strong&gt;Clubs&lt;/strong&gt; that have Reach 2. However they can use
these weapons in more creative ways beyond the usual basic attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smash and Swing&lt;/strong&gt; does half the damage of a basic attack, but dazes for a turn
and allows the ogre to slide the target up to 5 squares on a hit. It’s excellent
for herding PCs together so other monsters can use area attacks, and for opening
them up for the truly damaging attacks from the cave hunter itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these is &lt;strong&gt;Skull Bash&lt;/strong&gt;, which requires a dazed target and does
roughly double the damage of a basic attack. The second is &lt;strong&gt;Victim Shield&lt;/strong&gt;, an
interrupt that requires a dazed enemy within 2 squares and triggers when it’s
targeted by a melee or ranged attack. It gives the ogre +4 to defenses against
that attack, and if the attack misses the chosen victim takes its damage
instead. In that case the cave hunter can also slide the victim 4 squares to
another space within 2 squares of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the hunter doesn’t need to have dazed the victims itself in order to
use these abilities, so if there are other monsters who can daze in the fight,
they’ll be able to use these abilities more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogre-ironclad&quot;&gt;Ogre Ironclad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogre Ironclads are smart enough to wear piecemeal metal armor instead of the
more usual raw hides, and to fight using tactics that resemble cavalry, with
closed ranks and powerful charges. Since their armor is still kind of
improvised, being looted from smaller victims, it tends to fall off if it takes
too many hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironclads are Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They wield big &lt;strong&gt;Mauls&lt;/strong&gt; whose basic
attacks mark for a turn on a hit. Their &lt;strong&gt;Ironclad Reaction&lt;/strong&gt; gives them a free
attack against a marked enemy that ignores the mark, and this attack also pushes
the enemy 1 square and knocks them prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the ironclad is bloodied they take a -2 penalty to AC, but their charges
allow them to make basic attacks against up to 2 targets instead of the usual
single attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogre-storm-shaman&quot;&gt;Ogre Storm Shaman&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storm Shamans are perhaps the only ogres in the books that have no negative
modifiers in any of their mental attributes. They worship the primal spirits
that symbolize the fury of the storm, and their magic can bring that fury down
on their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storm Shamans are Level 11 Controllers with 114 HP. All of their attacks have a
storm magic theme. They can cast &lt;strong&gt;Thunder Blasts&lt;/strong&gt; to deal thunder damage and
deafen (save ends), or &lt;strong&gt;Call Lightning&lt;/strong&gt; to deal lightning damage and blind
(save ends). Their melee attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Thunder Staff&lt;/strong&gt; that deals thunder damage
and can daze (save ends) if it hits a blinded or deafened enemy. Those ranged
spells are also area attacks, so there’s a big chance that they’ll leave
&lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; vulnerable to a daze from the staff. A second shaman in the encounter
will make them both even more annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogre-dreadnought&quot;&gt;Ogre Dreadnought&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, this is pretty much an upgraded version of the Ogre Ironclad
above. Unlike the Ironclad, the Dreadnought actually uses custom-fitted gear,
wearing a full suit of plate and wielding a greatsword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreadnoughts are Level 14 Soldiers with 140 HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;greatsword&lt;/strong&gt; has a
Threatening Reach 2, and its basic attack also immobilizes for a turn on a
hit. If the dreadnought fails a saving throw, it can use &lt;strong&gt;Dreadnought Resolve&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 4+) as a reaction to immediately reroll it with a +2 bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re almost Brutes, in other words, since they lack a marking power. Still,
Threatening Reach and immobilizing attacks make them effective at halting the
PCs’ advance, so the Soldier role still fits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pretty varied lineup, especially when combined with the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/08/13/ogre.html&quot;&gt;Monster Vault
ogres&lt;/a&gt;. It should easily allow you to build all-ogre encounters for use as
the inhabitants of a lair or as a special unit in some other villainous force.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Oblivion Moss</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This based on the Obliviax, a monster that showed up in the 1e MM2. It’s
completely changed for this edition, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oblivion moss, sometimes also known as memory moss, is a sapient predatory plant
that lives in the depths of old forests. It looks like a carpet of moss, but it
can perceive its surroundings and move around slowly in search of prey. The
creature feeds on memories, which it strips from the brains of its victims. It
derives sustenance from those stolen thoughts, and can also use them to spawn
humanoid simulacra that help it defend itself and find more food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memory stripping process is not actually fatal or permanent, but it’s still
very traumatic. Stolen memories return at different rates. An adventurer’s
knowledge of combat spells and maneuvers might come back after mere seconds,
still in the middle of the fight. Important personal memories (“who am I?”) come
back after a day or two, but smaller details (“what does my mother look like?”)
can take weeks to be restored. Of course, the moss and its constructs are quite
capable of fighting to kill, and might choose to kill a victim anyway after
stealing their memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dryads and Treants cultivate patches of oblivion moss close to their own
territories, as a security measure. Invaders who stumble upon them have their
memories ripped away and end up turned around, leaving the forest without
knowing what they were doing or where they went while inside. Even if the
knowledge comes back later, very few people are keen on repeating the
experience. As the book says, in places where oblivion moss grows, lost ruins
tend to stay lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can turn the memory stealing around, too. The remains of a slain patch of
oblivion moss retain memory fragments from its past victims, and if someone eats
those bits they can acquire those memories. While the fragmentary memories of a
bandit might not give you their entire guard rotation or the map of their
stronghold, they might give you the combination to their main vault or to a
secret door.  That can be useful, though eating a sapient being presents obvious
ethical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a bunch of different stat blocks here, one for the moss itself and five
for the humanoid minions it can build from stolen memories. The minions can be
generated mid-fight by the moss, or they might be placed as normal monsters in
an encounter with or without their master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oblivion-moss-mindmaster&quot;&gt;Oblivion Moss Mindmaster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the moss itself, a Large Fey Magical Beast (plant) and a Level 12 Elite
Controller with 250 HP. It perceives the world with Blindsight 20, and moves
around at a glacial ground and climb speeds of 2. It does have Forest Walk,
though, so it’s not further slowed down by difficult terrain in its natural
habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moss projects a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Blindness Aura&lt;/strong&gt; (1) that makes it invisible to
enemies that start their turns inside until the end of the enemy’s next turn. It
can defend itself in melee with a &lt;strong&gt;Corriding Touch&lt;/strong&gt; that does immediate and
ongoing acid damage, but it really wants to use its psychic powers instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has two basic ranged attacks: &lt;strong&gt;Scramble the Mind&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Scour the
Mind&lt;/strong&gt;. Both to the same amount of psychic damage. Additionally, Scramble slides
the target 5 squares and Scour makes the moss or one of its allies invisible to
the target for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its ultimate attack is &lt;strong&gt;Absorb Memories&lt;/strong&gt;, a ranged attack vs. Will that does
no damage. A hit prevents the target from using encounter or daily attack powers
(save ends). Hit or miss, the moss then creates a mossling duplicate of the
target, which uses the most closely matching mossling stat block (see
below). This recharges when there are no created mosslings in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mindmaster can spend a minor action to &lt;strong&gt;Direct&lt;/strong&gt; a mossling, allowing it to
move its speed as a free action. And it can also &lt;strong&gt;Absorb Damage&lt;/strong&gt; as an
interrupt, taking into itself the damage from an attack that would hit a
mossling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a moss mindmaster would only be able to keep a single mossling around at a
time. If you want there to be more of them, add some as part of the initial
encounter makeup. Those don’t count as “created”, so the moss doesn’t have to
wait to use Absorb Memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mosslings&quot;&gt;Mosslings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mosslings are Medium Fey Humanoids, and all of them are Level 12
Minions. They’re meant to be copies of people whose memories were absorbed by
the oblivion moss - the creature is smart enough to seek out competent
combatants for this purpose, since they make for more powerful mosslings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their signature passive trait is &lt;strong&gt;Mindmaster’s Thrall&lt;/strong&gt; - if the mossling in
question was created by an oblivion moss mindmaster, it acts immediately after
its creator’s turn. They all have Forest Walk too, and a basic tendril attack
that does minion-tier damage and has a rider compatible with their role. But the
real star of the show here is the &lt;strong&gt;Simulacrum Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows them to
copy an at-will power from a PC!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the mossling was created by Absorb Memories during this fight, it will be a
power from the PC that attack targeted. If you’re adding the mossling as part of
the encounter, pick a PC whose class is similar to the mossling’s role and give
them one of that PC’s powers. The attack targets AC and its bonus is based on
the mossling’s level as normal, but the damage and all other effects are
identical to the PC’s, as if it was the PC who hit. Some of them copy melee
attacks, others copy ranged attacks, but the match-up is not a problem because
you always use a mossling archetype compatible with the power you want to
replicate, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book recommends having &lt;em&gt;the players themselves&lt;/em&gt; roll and resolve the
mossling’s attacks, to reinforce the feeling that they’re fighting
themselves. That’s clever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the different varieties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Guardian&lt;/strong&gt;: Soldier, speed 6. Has an aura (1) that slows
enemies. Tendril attack allows it to shift 1 square and pull an enemy into the
vacated space. Copies a melee power. Use to copy PC defenders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Creeper&lt;/strong&gt;: Skirmisher, speed 8. Deals extra damage with combat
advantage. Tendril strike allows it to shift 2 squares. Shifts 2 squares when
missed by a melee attack. Copies a melee power. Use to copy rogues and other
melee strikers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Hurler&lt;/strong&gt;: Artillery, speed 6. Explodes on death, dealing a bit of
psychic damage and inflicting Daze (save ends) on a Close Burst 2. No riders
on tendril attack. Steals a ranged power. Use to copy ranged strikers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Grower&lt;/strong&gt;: Controller (Leader). Has an aura (1) that grants +2
defense to plant allies. Tendril attack slows for a turn. Gives 20 temporary
hit points to every nonminion plant ally within 3 squares on death. Copies a
melee power. Use to copy warlords and other leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Vinecaller&lt;/strong&gt;: Controller. Has an aura (1) that makes the covered
spaces difficult terrain. Makes a Close Burst 1 in to difficult terrain for
the rest of the encounter on death. Tendril strike slides target 2
squares. Copies a ranged power. Use to copy wizards and other controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the mossling mechanic is really clever, particularly the bit where
players roll and resolve their duplicate’s attacks. It helps ease the GM’s
cognitive load a bit since mosslings are kinda finnicky even before you factor
the copied attack in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, a moss mindmaster can only keep one mossling around at a
time. If you want to have more of them in play, the easiest way is to add more
of them as standard minions to the encounter. In this case I guess they would
have their own Initiative rolls, and would be worth XP as normal, but the
mindmaster could still target them with Direct Mossling and Absorb Damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option might be to turn the Mindmaster into a solo! Aside from the usual
adjustments, you would want to make Absorb Memories at-will and remove the limit
on the number of created mosslings in play. Maybe also turn Absorb Damage into a
Free or No Action to make it usable as many times per turn as the moss wants.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Nymph</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nymphs have been in the game since the beginning, and they were always one of
its many, many “seductress” monsters. The only reason I can think for there
being so many of them is that Gygax had issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fourth Edition, Nymphs are fey descended from some of the oldest primal
spirits: the Sisters of the Four Seasons, and the Brothers of the Four
Winds. Thus they combine their mothers’ beauty with their fathers’ impulsive and
fickle personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Dawn War ended and the Four Seasons took upon themselves the work of
maintaining the world’s natural cycles, the nymphs withdrew into the Feywild and
spent a long time living there in harmony with nature. However, they’re not
content with just staying quiet forever, so they eventually began to range
further afield in search of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nymphs just love mortals. They make such wonderful toys, you see. It’s very easy
to convince them to do stuff, and to swear eternal loyalty and love. Toys
sometimes break, but that’s just how things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nymphs are divided into subtypes corresponding to the four seasons, each with a
different basic personality but sharing the same disdain for mortals. There’s
also a fifth type that explains where dryads come from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nymphs are Medium Fey Humanoids with Low Light Vision and Forest Walk (meaning
they ignore forest-themed difficult terrain). All of their other abilities vary
per stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spring-nymph&quot;&gt;Spring Nymph&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-nymph-spring.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring nymphs are always seeing new life appear everywhere to replace the
old. They have power over flowers, and adorn themselves with them. They are the
most childish and romantic of the bunch, so they enjoy seducing mortals and
playing mind games with them to get those mortals to chase her and to fight each
other for her favor. Spring nymphs will often ensure the prettiest mortal
survives these contests, and will then permanently dominate them through
constant exposure to the nymph’s psychotropic scent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring Nymphs are Level 5 Controllers with 63 HP and Speed 6. Their powers are
all seduction and flower-themed, making them some of the most stereotypical
nymphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a &lt;strong&gt;Charmed Defense&lt;/strong&gt; passive that gives them +3 to all defenses while
adjacent to a creature dominated by them. Their basic melee attack is
&lt;strong&gt;Passion’s Kiss&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets Will, does low psychic damage, and dazes (save
ends). Their basic ranged attack is &lt;strong&gt;Song of Spring&lt;/strong&gt;, which is similar but
does a bit more damage and slows instead of dazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she doesn’t have anyone dominated, the spring nymph can use &lt;strong&gt;Floral
Perfume&lt;/strong&gt; to rectify this situation. This is a ranged attack vs. Will that must
target a dazed or slowed creature, and on a hit pulls the target 3 squares and
dominates them (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, once per encounter, the nymph can use &lt;strong&gt;Cloud of Blossoms&lt;/strong&gt;, a ranged
area attack that targets non-dominated enemies, attacks Will, and slows on a hit
(save ends). After the first failed save, the target becomes unconscious
instead. So this is more of an emergency escape hatch than an opening strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When building an encounter with spring nymphs, you can add any number of sapient
humanoids of any species to Team Monster. These are her permanently dominated
pawns, and they should definitely count as “dominated” for the purposes of
Charmed Defense even if they act normally otherwise. Lacking any of these, the
nymph will do her best to keep a PC dominated and stick close to them. Spring
nymphs don’t do a lot of damage on their own, so they need the help of their
pawns. An encounter against &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; spring nymphs is very dangerous, though,
since they’ll be able to dominate multiple PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;autumn-nymphs&quot;&gt;Autumn Nymphs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-nymph-autumn.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the most melancholic members of the family. Autumn is the season when
leaves are reaching the end of their lives and remembering their pasts. Autumn
nymphs are always in that mood, and love collecting and remembering the stories
of mortals’ lives. Autumn nymphs trade in secrets, one for one. This makes them
good sources of information, but you have to be willing to share your own
secrets in exchange. If you don’t, their vengeance can be terrible and
persistent as they turn their secret-themed abilities against you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autumn Nymphs are Level 8 Skirmishers with 89 HP, a ground speed of 6 and a
flight speed of 6 (clumsy, like a leaf in the wind). Their basic attack is a
strike with their &lt;strong&gt;Oaken Strength&lt;/strong&gt;, which damages and pushes the target 1
square. Their other abilities are all secret-themed spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Revelation&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 6+) is a melee attack that causes light psychic
damage and stuns (save ends). It represents the nymph using contact telepathy to
fill the victim’s head with, well, fake news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whisper Game&lt;/strong&gt; is an interesting ranged attack. It inflicts immediate and
ongoing psychic damage (save ends). Until the end of the encounter, or until the
nymph drops to 0 HP, any time a creature saves against the ongoing damage the
condition “jumps” to the nearest of the victim’s allies within 10 squares. When
the nymph drops to 0 HP, whoever is suffering from this ongoing damage takes 15
psychic damage. This psychic hot potato recharges if the nymph misses with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a move action, the nymph can use &lt;strong&gt;Autumn Winds&lt;/strong&gt; to either shift 1 square or
move her speed, and then use Oaken Strength for free. And when an enemy misses
her with a melee attack, she can use &lt;strong&gt;Secret of Autumn Leaves&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction
to shift 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nymph’s first priority should be to get the Whisper Game going, then stun
someone with Dark Revelation whenever it’s available. After that she wants to
move around and herd the PCs using Oaken Strength so all of them remain close
enough to catch the Whisper Game damage. Autumn Nymphs don’t go for domination,
but they can still have willing fey allies to help with all that. Multiple
autumn nymphs in the same encounter means multiple Whisper Games and multiple
save-ends stuns in a round, so only do that if you really want to make your PCs
suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wood-nymphs&quot;&gt;Wood Nymphs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, an autumn nymph’s melancholy gets the better of her. She grows tired
of her games, or discovers she had actual fondness for a mortal that escaped her
clutches. These nymphs cast off their humanoid guises and give themselves over
to their wild natures, slowly transforming into trees. They stay for a long time
in this in-between state, and some go on to become dryads. The Wood Nymph stat
block represents the in-between state, where the nymph can leave its tree body
to attack trespassers or despoilers, but can’t move too far away from it. This
is actually closer to a mythological dryad than the D&amp;amp;D dryad is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood Nymphs are Level 10 Soldiers with 104 HP and speed 6. They are
&lt;strong&gt;Treebound&lt;/strong&gt;, which means they’ll be always encountered close to their
tree. This tree occupies 1 square on the battle map. The nymph can enter it and
gains full cover while inside. It also counts as an ally for the purposes of
flanking. While adjacent to or inside the tree, the nymph has &lt;strong&gt;Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt;
5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nymph’s first priority in battle is to tag someone with &lt;strong&gt;Trapped in the
Wood&lt;/strong&gt;, which does no damage but teleports the target inside the nymph’s
tree. This removes the victim from play (save ends). The nymph can teleport 8
squares to a space adjacent ot the tree as an effect. A successful save places
the victim back on the map, adjacent to the tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can also hit a PC with her &lt;strong&gt;Lonely Keening&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter ranged attack
that deals psychic damage on a hit. The interesting thing about it is its
effect, though, which happens even on a miss. Until the end of the encounter, or
until the nymph drops to 0 HP, the victim takes 5 damage at the end of any turn
in which it’s not either adjacent to the nymph or closer to her than they were
at the start of the turn. An excellent attack to use on those ranged PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the nymph can teleport up to 6 squares to a space adjacent to the tree
as a move action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that the victim of Trapped in the Wood is not considered to be in the tree’s
space for game purposes! They’re &lt;em&gt;removed from play&lt;/em&gt;. Which means the Nymph can
hit them with Lonely Keening, trap them in the tree, and stay adjacent to the
tree to keep her regeneration while damaging the victim at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appropriate buddies for wood nymphs include full dryads, wood woads, and other
treelike fey who are hanging around their new sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;winter-nymph&quot;&gt;Winter Nymph&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter nymphs live in cold and remote regions, and like their linked season
they’re cruel and harsh. Winter nymphs are all about reveling in the survival of
the strongest. They run ahead of the Wild Hunt, dressed in buckskin, their
nettle hair spreading out behind them in the wind. They seek the toughest and
most cunning opponents as their prey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter Nymphs are Level 15 Artillery with 116 HP, a ground speed of 7, and a fly
speed of 10. Unlike their sisters, they fight with weapons. Their basic melee
attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Hunter’s Knife&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and allows them to shift 1 square on
a hit. Their basic ranged attack is a longbow that shoots arrows laced with
&lt;strong&gt;Winter’s Wind&lt;/strong&gt;, doing cold damage and slowing on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If too many enemies crowd their space, they can use a &lt;strong&gt;Nettling Wind&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 5+) to target up to 3 creatures in a Close Blast 5. On a hit, this
does physical damage and immobilizes (save ends). And once per encounter they
can fire a &lt;strong&gt;Hail of Arrows&lt;/strong&gt; that works like like Area burst 3, Range 20
attack. It targets enemies, does physical damage, and inflicts ongoing physical
damage (save ends). That’s a good opening strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appropriate companions for winter nymphs are, of course, the Wild
Hunt. Paragon-tier fey hounds and perhaps some eladrin or firbolg hunters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summer-nymph&quot;&gt;Summer Nymph&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-nymph-summer.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring is about the potential of the future; autumn about reflecting on the
past; and summer is the present. Summer nymphs are among the eldest and wisest
of the seasons’ children, for they see everything as it comes to pass. Though
they love to play games with mortals just as much as their sisters, their own
games are much more complex, some times spanning multiple worlds and vast
stretches of time. They are the nymph’s equivalent of board game geeks, and they
love playing live-action Twilight Imperium and Diplomacy. Their motivations and
goals are always hidden from those she uses as playing pieces, and might look
inscrutable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nymph portrayed here is a legit demigodess, a Level 25 Controller with 233
HP and the Leader keyword. She is peer to elder dragons and to the greatest
among angels and devils, and she could end up interacting with gods or exarchs
directly. Not being an elite or solo, she’s not as individually powerful as some
of those dragons and immortals, but she can command nature itself in the form of
large hosts of animals, fey, and plant creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summer nymph projects an aura of &lt;strong&gt;Renewing Growth&lt;/strong&gt; (5) that makes its
covered area into difficult terrain for enemies. Any enemy inside the aura who
doesn’t move during their turn is slowed until the end of their next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her attacks do below-average damage, but have powerful control effects. Her
melee basic attack is &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom’s Touch&lt;/strong&gt;, which damages and dazes for a
turn. Her basic ranged attack is &lt;strong&gt;Eyes of Summer&lt;/strong&gt;,  which deals radiant
damage and blinds (save ends). She can also &lt;strong&gt;Call Storm Winds&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+),
a ranged area attack that deals lighting and thunder damage to enemies, and
slides them 3 squares on a hit. The storm persists for a turn and can be
sustained with a minor action, which also allows the nymph to slide anyone
inside it 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an at-will move action, the nymph can employ her &lt;strong&gt;Omniscient Strategy&lt;/strong&gt; to
shift 1 square and allow one of her allies to move their speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summer nymph is a mastermind, so PCs will likely come into contact with her
minions and with the edges of her scheme long before they fight her in
person. If that happens, she will certainly be accompanied by a bodyguard of
similarly epic fey, including elder treants, mythical beasts, and eladrin
nobles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can also be used in a more ambiguous role, as a dangerous source of
information. She is guaranteed to know the answer to any question about the
present state of the universe, but the favors she asks in return are also
guaranteed to advance some obscure scheme of hers and make pawns of the PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pleasantly surprised that out of the five nymph variants we saw here, only
one of them is actually a seductress. And even that one is more about
floral-scented mind control than the “she’s just that sexy” trope of old D&amp;amp;D
nymphs. As a bonus, the text never mentions the gender of the hapless mortal
victims, so this is equal-opportunity mind control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorites are the winter and summer nymphs, who do the most to break that old
stereotype. The wood nymph comes next for her tree-based shenanigans, though
narratively she’s very redundant with 4e dryads.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Norker</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-norker.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norkers have been around since the days of AD&amp;amp;D, where their major mechanical
distinction was that they were stronger goblins with AC 3. They play a
significant role in The Forgotten Temple or Tharizdun as the rank and file of
the occupying force the PCs need to clear out before they can delve the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norkers in 4e are descendants of goblins who emigrated to the Elemental Chaos
and sought shelter in deep caves in order to survive the harsh conditions of
that plane. The earth-aspected ambient energy of their chosen habitat mutated
them over generations, granting them stony skin and minor earth-based powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norker populations have since crossed back into the middle world, where they
live in mountainous regions, in the Underdark, and near fonts of earth-aspected
elemental power. Some sages speculate that the original norkers lived near sites
of power related to Ogrémoch, the Evil Elemental Prince of Earth, because modern
norkers are often found working for his cultists or those of the Elder Elemental
Eye, guarding his forgotten temples in another very obvious historical
reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norkers retain their conceptual role as rank-and-file opposition for
paragon-tier (AKA “name level”) characters, which in 4e means they’re much
stronger than they ever were. Their levels range from around 12 to 15 here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re Small Elemental Humanoids with Low-Light Vision and Speed 6, with
abilities combining martial training and minor earth magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;norker-stone-shield&quot;&gt;Norker Stone Shield&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone Shields look like an unruly mob at first glance, but they’re professional
soldiers trained by those elemental cults and other earth-themed villains. Their
training and equipment allows them to fight a bit like a roman legion, keeping
tight formations, throwing javelins and them closing in to batter enemies with
their short clubs and shields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone Shields are Level 12 Soldiers with 124 HP, which means a sizable group of
them can eat most typical human military units for breakfast. Their basic
attacks are a &lt;em&gt;club&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;javelin&lt;/em&gt;, both of which mark for a turn on a hit. If
a marked enemy adjacent to the norker shifts, it can attack them with a &lt;strong&gt;Shield
Slam&lt;/strong&gt; vs. Fortitude that damages and knocks prone on a hit. And if someone hits
them in melee they can respond with an &lt;strong&gt;Elemental Rebuke&lt;/strong&gt;, a reaction that
attacks AC and does some minor damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;norker-grunt&quot;&gt;Norker Grunt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it seems stone shields are rarified elites. The actual rank and
file of a norker force will be made of of these guys, who are far less organized
and prefer to use “charging horde” tactics with their clubs. Their natural
strength and toughness still makes them a very hard problem for human
militaries, and even PCs don’t want to get surrounded by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grunts are Level 15 Minion Brutes, and their only active ability is their
&lt;strong&gt;Club&lt;/strong&gt; attack. Their &lt;strong&gt;Harrassing Brute&lt;/strong&gt; trait is what makes them truly
dangerous. All of the grunt’s allies get a damage bonus against enemies equal to
twice the number of grunts adjacent to that enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s unpack that for a moment. Let’s say 4 grunts are adjacent to the party’s
fighter. Each of those grunts will get a +8 damage bonus when they attack the
fighter. So will the grunt’s artillery and controller bosses who are 5 squares
away from this scrum. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, grunts want to slip past the front line and harrass the enemy
squishies, but as we can see from the example above they can still do pretty
well against defenders if Team Monster decides to focus fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;norker-stone-walker&quot;&gt;Norker Stone Walker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone Walkers norkers who received proper training in earth magic, and who
combine that with a mobile fighting style. They’re Level 15 Skirmishers with 150
HP. They can attack with &lt;strong&gt;handaxes&lt;/strong&gt; in melee or at range, doing extra damage
if they have combat advantage. They also have a +4 AC bonus against opportunity
attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic-wise, they have the same &lt;strong&gt;Elemental Rebuke&lt;/strong&gt; reaction as the Stone
Shield, and they can also use &lt;strong&gt;Earth Glide&lt;/strong&gt; as a move action to move their
speed and phase through earth and rock during this movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last one makes them excellent additions to an underground encounter. Place
a couple of them behind a thin rock wall and have them flank the PCs after the
stone shields and grunts begin their frontal assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tough norkers still fill more or less the same narrative role as before, they do
so in a very different way. I think my favorites are the grunts; the damage
bonus they grant is both very distinctive and terrifying to players. When
scaling their level, I’d probably make it +1/tier instead of a flat +2.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Nerra</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-nerra.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first I’ve heard of Nerras, though it’s possible they originated in
a previous edition. If they did, their lore was completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many ages ago, a sect of mortal invokers called the Sect of Seventy came to
believe that the gods had grown too detached from the middle world in the
aftermath of the Dawn War. They had become incapable of defending it from the
many threats and hazards that lingered from those terrible battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sect of Seventy decided to claim for themselves the role of protectors of
the middle world, and set about building a grand work that would allow them to
keep watch over all reality. They used their divine magic to build an astral
dominion they named The Constellation of Eyes. Located far from all the other
known dominions, it consisted of a central reflective crystal sphere around
which orbited uncountable mirrors that reflected different parts of the universe
and could be used as portals to reach those places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the Constellation is the ultimate panopticon, capable of
maintaining surveillance over the entire universe and allowing its owners to
instantly deploy to places of interest. The Sect intended it to be the perfect
“superhero base” from which they would keep watch over reality, but other
interested parties had far more nefarious uses in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sect was unknowingly infiltrated by a small group of priests of Asmodeus,
who intended to seize it for themselves and use it to open a permanent portal to
the Nine Hells that would give devils free access to the rest of the
multiverse. The invokers only managed to discover this after the final ritual
had already began. The ensuing battle was every bit as epic as you imagine, and
the resulting flare of divine energy from both sides was strong enough for the
other gods to notice and send their angels to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The angels would have been a great help, but they arrived too late. As far as
they were able to determine, the invokers realized they were losing the battle,
and enacted a desperate ritual of their own that would bring terrible ruin upon
all that were in the Constellation of Eyes. The ritual worked. It turned both
the invokers and the Asmodean priests into the creatures now known as Nerras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These mirrored crystaline humanoids still dwell in the Constellation of
Eyes. With no apparent memory of their previous lives, they spent the following
eons acting as dispassionate observers of the multiverse. Their observations are
recorded in specially constructed glass tablets that can only be read from a
slanted angle, and their collected store of information is one of the greatest
in existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatively recently, though, the nerras have changed their behavior and become
more proactive. They’ve taken to crossing their mirror portals and kidnapping
certain powerful and influential individuals. Back at the Constellation, the
nerras use their magic to create a perfect duplicate of the subject, with a
diametrically opposite moral outlook. Then they send both back home. This
predictably causes a lot of problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nerras target both terrible villains and virtuous heroes in equal measure. Those
scholars aware of their history theorize that ancient memories of the nerras’
former lives are resurfacing and causing divisions among them, and that their
new activities are an experiment to see which between good and evil is stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nerras also travel to places they consider interesting to monitor things from up
close, and sometime they interfere in local events for inscrutable
reasons. Sometimes their interference ends up causing wars and disasters, some
times they prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nerras despise demons, devils, and creatures of the Far Realm, but they ally
with other creatures when their goals happen to align. Even their occasional
allies have little insight on their true motives, which they keep to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nerra are Medium Immortal Humanoids, with Speed 6 and human-standard
senses. Their signature ability is &lt;strong&gt;Mirror Step&lt;/strong&gt;, an at-will move action that
allows them to teleport 5 squares to a space adjacent to a mirror or to another
nerra. This means a group of nerras finds it very easy to maintain a cohesive
formation, and that their preferred battlegrounds have lots of mirrors that they
can use for extra mobility. All of the ones we see here are Unaligned, and they
speak Supernal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of their other abilities vary per stat block, though they all tend to share
a strong “mirror” theme. Their levels cover the mid-to-late Paragon tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;varoot-nerra&quot;&gt;Varoot Nerra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varoots are elite scouts and spies. They’re the first to venture forth from the
Constellation of Eyes to lay the groundwork for a nerra expedition. Their
ability to copy the appearances of others makes them great infiltrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varoot Nerras are Level 16 Lurkers with the Shapechanger keyword and 116
HP. Their main weapon is a &lt;strong&gt;shard blade&lt;/strong&gt; similar to a longsword. Their
&lt;strong&gt;Reflection Theft&lt;/strong&gt; ability allows them to perfectly duplicate an enemy within
10 squares of it. The effect lasts until the end of the encounter, or until the
varoot attacks. If the varoot is adjacent to the copying enemy, it gets to roll
a save against any melee or ranged attack that targets it, with a success
forcing the attack to target the copied enemy instead. It also gains a +2 bonus
to attack and a +5 bonus to damage against the copied enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its last ability aside from Mirror Step is &lt;strong&gt;Mirrored Grasp&lt;/strong&gt;, a minor-action
power that lets the nerra teleport an unattended object of up to 20 pounds /
10kg that’s within 10 squares and line of sight to its hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combat, the Varoot does it’s Lurker routine by “hiding” next to a PC it’s
copying, attacking the copied PC with a damage bonus, and teleporting away using
Mirror Step so it can transform and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no way to pierce the varoot’s disguise with a skill check, at least in
the ability’s combat form. It would make sense to rule that outside of combat
this works like a doppelganger’s transformation: it lasts a long time and can be
contested with Insight vs. the nerra’s Bluff of +20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meerak-nerra&quot;&gt;Meerak Nerra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeraks are the rank and file of a Nerra strike force. They charge into the
enemy to cut it up with their spiked, jagged bodies, softening them up for the
more powerful individuals that always follow close behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeraks are Level 18 Minion Soldiers. Their &lt;strong&gt;Mirror Slash&lt;/strong&gt; basic attacks mark
on a hit, and their &lt;strong&gt;Mirror Defense&lt;/strong&gt; ability is an interrupt that triggers
when they’re hit by a melee attack and deals 10 damage to a different enemy
within 10 squares. The meerak is still going to die from the hit, but not before
reflecting some damage to a PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kalareem-nerra&quot;&gt;Kalareem Nerra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kalareems are elite knights among the nerra. Unlike a lot of their crystalline
relatives, they look like they’re made out of mirror-smooth liquid metal. This
makes them hard to hurt, and they can also briefly solidify parts of their
bodies to launch a spray of deadly metal shards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kalareem Nerras are Level 19 Soldiers with 175 HP. Their liquid metal
construction doesn’t translate to specific abilities but it’s a nice
in-character explanation for the high defenses and HP a level 19 Soldier
has. Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Shard Blade&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and marks on a hit, as
do the &lt;strong&gt;Shard Blasts&lt;/strong&gt; they can fire at-will in a Close Burst 3 pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the standard nerra Mirror Step, they also have two other
mirror-themed abilities that make them good bodyguards. &lt;strong&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/strong&gt; is an
interrupt that triggers when a marked enemy makes a melee or ranged attack that
doesn’t include the nerra as a target. It makes the enemy target the nerra
instead. &lt;strong&gt;Mirror Defense&lt;/strong&gt; is another interrupt that triggers when the kalareem
is hit by a melee attack. The creature can then make an attack against the Will
of the triggering enemy, which on a hit deals the same damage inflicted by the
triggering attack. This is an interrupt, so the attacker gets damaged &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;
the nerra, and if they get reduced to 0 HP the kalareem wouldn’t suffer the
damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sillit-nerra&quot;&gt;Sillit Nerra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sillits are nerra spellcasters, who often act as field agents and
mystically-oriented scouts. Like other spellcasting monsters, out of combat they
should have access to whatever rituals are required by the story. In combat,
they use mirror-themed spells and specialize in forcibly teleporting enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sillits are Level 19 Controllers with 181 HP. Even their basic attack is a
&lt;strong&gt;Mirror Portal&lt;/strong&gt; that targets Will, and on a hit damages and teleports the
target adjacent to one of the sillit’s allies within 10 squares. Their basic
ranged attack is &lt;strong&gt;Warped Image&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets Fortitude and on a hit damages
and teleports the target 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their special attack is &lt;strong&gt;Captured Image&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), a ranged power that
targets Will. On a hit it removes the target from play (save ends), trapping it
within the mirrors that make up the sillit’s body. While the target is captured,
it takes 20 damage whenever the sillit is damaged. The effect ends when the
target successfully saves, or when the sillit is reduced to 0 HP. When this
happens the target appears on a square of the sillit’s choice within 5 squares
of the sillit itself. Yes, it’s entirely possible that a sillit who gets lucky
with its recharge rolls will manage to capture multiple targets at the same
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sillits have the standard Mirror Step power, and the same Mirrored Grasp power
of the Varoots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging from their powers, Sillits love to fight in maps containing plenty of
hazardous terrain, and accompanied by bruiser allies. They’ll use Captured Image
as soon and as often as they can, and then move to the front lines to dare PCs
to attack them. Inconveniently strong melee PCs can be teleported next to the
bruisers with Mirror Portal, and Warped Image is good for disrupting the
remaining PCs if no other opportunities arise. Hazardous terrain on the
battlefield makes those forced teleports more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delphar-nerra&quot;&gt;Delphar Nerra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delphars are the officers and commanders of nerra forces. They’re similar to
kalareems in their training, but they’re much larger and their mere presence has
bolstering effects on the abilities of their allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other nerra, delphars are Large and have Speed 8. They’re Level 20
Soldiers with 187 HP and the Leader tag. They project a &lt;strong&gt;Mirrored Rampart&lt;/strong&gt;
aura (5) that extends the range of other nerras’ Mirror Step to 10. They fight
with a &lt;strong&gt;Shard Blade&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Shard Blasts&lt;/strong&gt; that have the same effects as those
of kalareems, with slightly higher numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a different way of punishing marked enemies, though: &lt;strong&gt;Mirrored
Grasp&lt;/strong&gt; triggers when a marked enemy within 10 squares ignores the mark, and
teleports the enemy adjacent to the delphar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;teltarym-nerra&quot;&gt;Teltarym Nerra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would expect the strongest monster in the entry to be some sort of dread
overlord, but we’re talking about topsy-turvy mirror people here. Teltarym are
the nerra’s manual laborers, joining the fight either because they must defend
themselves or because they were ordered to. Despite not being formal combatants
they’re very strong and aggressive, charging in to smash enemies with their huge
fists, and reflecting their own wounds back at their attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teltarym are Level 21 Brutes with 237 HP. Like delphars, they’re Large and have
Speed 8. Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Hammer Fist&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and pushes 1
square, and they can use it twice in the same action. &lt;strong&gt;Reflected Pain&lt;/strong&gt; is a
reaction that triggers when they’re hit by a melee attack, and which inflicts
half the damage they suffered to the attacker. This recharges when they’re first
bloodied. Their last ability is Mirror Step, so like most brutes they’re fairly
simple to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the perfect bruiser allies for Sillits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the lore of the nerra quite a lot. It’s nice and epic and introduces a
new and interesting location on the Astral Sea. I also like how they’re depicted
as enigmatic instead of evil. A campaign against nerra is one where violence
might be necessary to drive them off, but where true victory can only be
achieved through unraveling their mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanics wise it seems varoots are a bit too low level to hang out with their
nerra buddies, so you’re going to meet them alone at the start of a
nerra-focused story arc. They might be accompanied by local agents or
mecernaries. The others are all of a level range where you can use them to build
all-nerra encounter groups.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 1982, there was a movie named &lt;em&gt;The Dark Crystal&lt;/em&gt;. It introduced these
cool villainous vulture people called the Skeksis, which became kind of
iconic. D&amp;amp;D wanted in on some of that action, so it added a species called the
Nagpa to Mystara. Nagpas are to Skeksis what Halflings are to Hobbits, which
means that they started out just barely different enough to avoid a lawsuit and
got significantly changed in each subsequent edition. This is their 4e debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, during the Dawn War, the Primordials realized they needed
servitors that could act as special forces. They already commanded uncountable
hordes of elementals, but they were mostly dumb as rocks and only good as shock
troops. Giants and djinns were smart and individually powerful, but too few in
number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they decided to take a page from the playbook of the gods and create a
servitor species they named the nagpas. Created to be as beautiful as nymphs and
as clever as devils, the nagpas readily took to their new role and proceeded to
wreak havoc on the armies of the gods for a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when the Dawn War was nearing its end, the nagpas were clever enough to
realize that their side would lose. And so it was that they made a deal with the
gods to betray their masters. However, they were caught, and the primordials
cursed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curse took away the beauty of the nagpas, turning them into horrid
vulture-like beings. It also doomed them to never touch that which they desired
the most. A nagpa who loved fine food and wine would always taste foulness when
he tried to eat or drink. One who loved art would see it crumble at a touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagpas were either already immortal, or were made so by the curse. Even when
slain, they reincarnate within a few decades with all memories of their previous
lives and deaths. Every nagpa alive today remembers their life before the curse,
and is obsessed with those things it cannot have. They tend to destroy mirrors
or any other surface that can show them their own faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primordial curse angle is interesting. Without it, you could argue that
their vulture-like appearance is a subjective thing. Some people think they’re
ugly, they themselves like it just fine. But a curse might make them
“axiomatically” ugly: not only are others unable to see beauty in them, they are
incapable of seeing it in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagpas are Medium Elemental Humanoids with Low-Light Vision and a speed
of 6. Everything else comes from training and varies per stat block. The two
stat blocks here have a wizardly bent, and use magic with a corruption and decay
theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nagpa-corruptor&quot;&gt;Nagpa Corruptor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nagpa Corruptor is given as an example of an art-loving nagpa. Its lair
looks like a museum, with cordoned-off works of art on display (but no
reflective surfaces!). It employs a large number with a similarly evil
disposition to protect its collection and acquire more pieces for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruptors are Level 9 Controllers with 97 HP. Their basic attacks are a
&lt;strong&gt;withering staff&lt;/strong&gt; that deals necrotic damage and pushes 2 squares, and a
ranged &lt;strong&gt;Withering Blast&lt;/strong&gt; that deals necrotic damage and immobilizes (save
ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also use a ranged &lt;strong&gt;Devouring Fire&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) spell that deals
fire damage and ongoing fire damage (save ends). Each failed save also deals a
bit of fire damage to up to 3 enemies adjacent to the target. The text says
“each ally” but I’m interpreting that to mean “each ally of the target”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their strongest attack is an encounter power named &lt;strong&gt;Corrupting Curse&lt;/strong&gt;, a close
blast 5 that deals necrotic damage and creates a zone that prevents enemies
inside from regaining HP. It lasts until the end of the encounter. Their other
encounter power is an &lt;strong&gt;Enervating Blast&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s another close blast 5 that can
be cast as a minor action, deals no damage and weakens those it hits for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruptors let their hired muscle do most of the fighting, hitting their enemies
with opportunistic spells from afar. They’re one of the rare monsters that
include more specific “director’s notes” in their text, though: if the fight
happens inside the corruptor’s lair/gallery, PCs should be able to its beloved
art objects. The first time one is destroyed, the corruptor becomes dazed for a
turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nagpa-carrion-lord&quot;&gt;Nagpa Carrion Lord&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a gourmand who loved good food and drink, but who is cursed to only
taste ashes and filth when it eats. It still likes holding feasts, but its
inability to enjoy them fill it with rage and frustration, which it takes out on
any nearby PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Carrion Lord is a Level 14 Artillery monster with 111 HP. All of its
abilities have a “rot” theme, starting with the &lt;strong&gt;Rotting Staff&lt;/strong&gt; basic melee
attack that targets Fortitude and does necrotic damage. Its basic ranged attack
is the &lt;strong&gt;Bolt of Putrescence&lt;/strong&gt;, targetting Reflex and doing, you guessed it,
necrotic damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand of Ruin&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) is a ranged attack that changes things up a
little and does acid damage. &lt;strong&gt;Consuming Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) is a ranged area
attack that deals immediate and ongoing necrotic damage, and creates a zone that
blocks line of sight to the carrion lord’s enemies. Its allies can see through
it just fine, though. It lasts for a turn and can be sustained with a minor
action. The lord’s last encounter power is &lt;strong&gt;Ghostly Escape&lt;/strong&gt;, a minor action
that gives it insubstantial and phasing for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Carrion Lord likely opens the fight with Consuming Shadows, and then keeps
using its two ranged attacks from beyond the sight of the PCs while its
melee-oriented bodyguards keep them pinned in place. Ghostly escape is reserved
for doing what its name says, and letting the nagpa get away after it sees the
fight is lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to say the same thing everyone who has reviewed a Nagpa entry always
says: they’re skeksis. The way in which they’re skeksis tends to vary with the
edition, though. I think the ones from the source material were pursuing
immortality. These ones achieved it, but found that it brings them no joy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Minotaur</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-minotaur.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minotaurs made their 4e debut right in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2020/07/23/minotaur.html&quot;&gt;first Monster Manual&lt;/a&gt;. They’d
also appear in the Monster Vault. As it happens with a lot of other monsters in
the same situation, the MM3 gives us a set of minotaur stat blocks that
complements the ones from the MV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minotaurs are a playable option as of the PHB 3, so their &lt;a href=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2020/07/23/minotaur.html&quot;&gt;basic lore&lt;/a&gt; is
quite a bit more lenient with them than that of other “monstrous humanoids”. The
MM3 innovates here by presenting us with a &lt;em&gt;specific organization&lt;/em&gt; of evil
minotaurs rather than trying to describe the whole species again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This organization is called the Blood League. Its members have invented rituals
that allow them to steal the power of another creature by eating its
still-beating heart. They like to capture potential targets and release them
into a special labyrinth they control, hunting the victim to the limits of its
endurance and only then making the kill. They often work with worshippers of
Torog and Baphomet, who share aspects of their worldview and tastes. They also
work with mind flayers, who get to eat the victims’ brains after the Blood
League is done with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry presents several Blood League minotaurs that take their powers from a
variety of creatures. They’re all early Paragon threats. All of them are Medium
Natural Humanoids and have a &lt;strong&gt;Goring Charge&lt;/strong&gt; attack that does heavy physical
damage and knocks prone on a hit. They also have a &lt;strong&gt;Ferocity&lt;/strong&gt; trait that gives
them one final basic attack when they’re dropped to 0 HP, with an additional
rider that varies per stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novel thing here is the &lt;strong&gt;Heart&lt;/strong&gt; ability each minotaur gets. This is
something thematic to the creature they killed to gain their powers. It’s
usually an encounter or recharge power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pale-bloodfiend&quot;&gt;Pale Bloodfiend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one has eaten the heart of a vampire, proving that “still-beating” is a
poetic flourish and not a requirement. It’s a Level 12 Brute with 140 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bloodfiend gained most of a vampire’s cool powers without any of the
disadvantages, much like Marvel’s Blade. It has a Speed of 8, Darkvision, claws,
and a blood-draining bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; are a basic attack, and can be used twice in a &lt;strong&gt;Double Claw&lt;/strong&gt;
maneuver. If both attacks hit, the bloodfiend grabs the target. It can then use
&lt;strong&gt;Heart of the Vampire&lt;/strong&gt; against the grabbed victim, an attack vs. Fortitude
that deals a light physical damage, dazes and weakens (save ends both). A hit
also heals the bloodfiend for 20 HP. This is an encounter power that recharges
on a miss, and likely represents some sort of blood-draining bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Bloodfiend’s Ferocity&lt;/strong&gt; makes its final attack daze for a turn on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cinderhoof-trampler&quot;&gt;Cinderhoof Trampler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one has eaten the heart of a nightmare. It’s a Level 13 Skirmisher with 132
HP. It smells of brimstone and burnt hair. It runs very fast, and gains a few
fire- and trample- based powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its speed is 8, and it has Resist 10 Fire. When it hits a target granting combat
advantage to it, it inflicts ongoing 10 fire damage (save ends). It’s basic
attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Gore&lt;/strong&gt;, and its special ability is &lt;strong&gt;Heart of the Nightmare&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 6+). This allows it to move its speed and enter enemy spaces during
this move. Anyone that hits the trampler with an opportunity attack during the
move takes 10 fire damage, and any creatures whose space it moves through are
targeted by an attack vs. Reflex that deals heavy physical damage and knocks
them prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Trampler’s Ferocity&lt;/strong&gt; pushes the target 2 squares and knocks it prone on a
hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ironskin-warrior&quot;&gt;Ironskin Warrior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This elite Blood Leaguer has eaten the heart of a gorgon, one of the
metal-skinned gas-breathing bulls of D&amp;amp;D. It’s a Level 14 Soldier with 140 HP,
and has Resist 10 Poison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, the ironskin warrior has metal skin, but that’s rolled into
its Soldierly high AC. It fights with a &lt;strong&gt;greataxe&lt;/strong&gt; that damages, slows and
prevents shifting (save ends both). The &lt;strong&gt;Heart of the Gorgon&lt;/strong&gt; encounter bility
is a poison breath attack (close burst 5 vs. Fortitude). A hit deals poison
damage and slows (save ends). This worsens to immobilization on the first failed
save, and to full petrification after the second failure. Petrification is
permanent and requires magic to reverse. It’s a good fight opener, because it
has the chance to take an unlucky PC out of the fight completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Ironskin’s Ferocity&lt;/strong&gt; immobilizes the target for a turn on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shardhorn-hunter&quot;&gt;Shardhorn Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This fearsome assassin has eaten the heart of a unicorn and made a dagger out of
its horn. Just in case you doubted the Blood League was evil. It’s a Level 15
Lurker with 116 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;strong&gt;horn dagger&lt;/strong&gt; can be used for basic attacks, and it can also &lt;strong&gt;backstab&lt;/strong&gt;
an enemy granting combat advantage to the hunter. This deals the same damage as
the basic attack, plus ongoing 10 damage (save ends). &lt;strong&gt;Heart of the Unicorn&lt;/strong&gt;
helps with this: it allows the hunter to teleport 6 squares and turn invisible
for a turn or until it attacks. It recharges when the hunter uses Backstab (hit
or miss).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Shardhorn’s Ferocity&lt;/strong&gt; dazes for a turn on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a specific evil organization with specific methods and goals, and a nice
set of thematic powers. It’s not something that would have flown in the first
Monster Manual (which needs to be more generic), but it’s very welcome in a
subsequent supplement like this one. I want more of this!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Mind Flayer</title>

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind flayers made their 4e debut back in the first Monster Manual. This entry
adds more lore to them, and more stat blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind flayers maintain one of the most evil civilizations in the Underdark, and
that’s saying something. Illithids are aggressive supremacists who prefer to
engage with even drow and duergar through slave-taking raids rather than
anything resembling diplomacy. Their settlements consist of a large population
of permanently mind-controlled thralls from every other sapient species in the
Underdark, supporting a small collective of illithid masters, who in turn might
be led by an Elder Brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elder Brains live in special life support vats, and are psionic
powerhouses. Third Edition had Elder Brains as deceivers who absorbed the
knowledge and power of deceased illithids. Fifth Edition would make mind flayers
into a full-on hive mind centered on the brains. Here in Fourth they’re neither
of those things. Instead, they are revered leaders and masterminds. They form
the center of a telepathic network linking all the illithids in the collective,
who can communicate and share information instantly through it while retaining
their individuality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an illithid collective passes a certain threshold of size and combined
power, it performs a specific procedure on its wisest and most respected
member. The volunteer’s head is severed and placed in the support tank, where it
is kept alive. The other mind flayers then focus their psionic energy on the
head over an extended period of time, causing it to grow in size and power until
it becomes an Elder Brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, mind flayers don’t really “do” diplomacy. Their
non-illithid allies are almost all slaves and mind-controlled thralls. They
usually come from some of the other sapient people of the Underdark, though a
mind flayer with access to the surface will happily enthrall surfacers as
well. Occasionally you’ll find other aberrant monsters working alongside them,
either as thralls or as allies of convenience in a symbiotic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lone illithids might end up making actual alliances with other villains, though
they only cooperate on their own terms even then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As before, mind flayers are Medium Aberrant Humanoids with Darkvision and
Speed 7. All of them have psychic powers and something that lets them mess with
other people’s brains, but the specifics vary per stat block. The entries in the
MM1 and Monster Vault focus on the mid Paragon tier. These show stronger
individuals in the early Epic tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mind-flayer-inquisitor&quot;&gt;Mind Flayer Inquisitor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, inquisitors are strong telepaths. The flavor text describes
one of them hiding in abandoned tunnels and kidnapping nobles and sages to feast
on their brains and memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inquisitors are Level 20 Controllers with 190 HP. Their basic melee attack are
the classic grabby &lt;strong&gt;tentacles&lt;/strong&gt;, which target Reflex. A hit damages and grabs
the victim (Athletics DC 31 or Acrobatics DC 33 to escape). Once the inquisitor
has grabbed a victim, it can use &lt;strong&gt;Implant Delusions&lt;/strong&gt; on them. This targets
Will, does psychic damage, and inflicts the custom “delusions” condition (save
ends). Victims suffering from delusions inflict a -2 penalty to all attacks and
defenses of adjacent allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their ranged powers start with the classic &lt;strong&gt;mind blast&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) that
inflicts psychic damage and dazes (save ends). A miss does half damage. Their
&lt;strong&gt;Own Worst Enemy&lt;/strong&gt; ability is an Area Burst 2 with a range of 10 squares. It
hits &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt; and forces every enemy in the area to use an at-will power
of the inquisitor’s choice against themselves! Thankfully it’s an encounter
power that recharges when the inquisitor is first bloodied, but it’s still rough
on those Essentials martials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, the inquisitor can force an &lt;strong&gt;Unwilling Confession&lt;/strong&gt; from an
enemy within 10 squares. This is an attack against Will, and though it does no
damage it prevents the victim from being affected by healing and by powers that
grant saves (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, when the inquisitor sees an enemy succeed at a saving throw, they
can use &lt;strong&gt;Forceful Submission&lt;/strong&gt; to force them to re-roll that save with a -2
penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inquisitors work well with a solid frontline of brutes or soldiers who can keep
them safe and isolate possible victims for melee attacks. They also pair well
with other monsters loaded with save-ends powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mind-flayer-scourge&quot;&gt;Mind Flayer Scourge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flavor text here tells the story of how early surface psionics honed their
abilities by raiding mind flayer lairs and trying to steal their secrets. The
discipline of the mind flayer scourge was developed in response to these
raids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scourges are Level 21 Skirmishers with 199 HP. They have Resist 10 Psychic,
which does help a lot against most psionic PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have the usual grabby &lt;strong&gt;tentacles&lt;/strong&gt; and dazing &lt;strong&gt;mind blast&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge
5+). Their tentacles also daze the grabbed victim while the grab lasts, and
the &lt;strong&gt;Mind Leech&lt;/strong&gt; passive trait allows them to make an extra saving throw or
recharge roll while grabbing a victim. They can even recharge their &lt;strong&gt;Psychic
Assault&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power with a roll of 6+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychic Assault targets the grabbed victim’s Will. On a hit it deals a bit of
psychic damage and dominates the victim (save ends, but with a -4 penalty). On a
miss, it deals half damage and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; dominates the victim (save ends). As
mentioned above this is an encounter power but the scourge can recharge it with
Mind Leech. It’s extremely bad news for the PCs. Scourges prefer to use it on
spellcasters or psionics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If surrounded, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Alter Reality&lt;/strong&gt; as a minor action to teleport an
adjacent enemy 2 squares, allowing them to potentially disengage from a defender
without triggering any reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thoon-hulk&quot;&gt;Thoon Hulk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mind flayers aren’t a very religious lot, but there is at least one entity they
speak of with the reverence others would reserve for a god. Its name is Thoon,
and that’s pretty much all non-illithids know about the subject. Whatever
relationship Thoon might have with these brutish monstrosities remains a
mystery, but they do show us that mind flayers have no problem performing
horrific experiments on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoon Hulks are much stronger and less intelligent than a typical mind flayer,
but they still retain their psionic powers. They’re found as servants to
“baseline” mind flayers and to other powerful aberrants like aboleths. They’re
Level 22 Brutes with 255 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hulk’s basic attack is named &lt;strong&gt;Eviscerate&lt;/strong&gt;, and uses its giant axe
hands. This deals extra damage against creatures grabbed by the hulk. It can
still grab using &lt;strong&gt;tentacles&lt;/strong&gt;, which do no damage but are a minor action. This
means it can grab and eviscerate on the same turn. Its &lt;strong&gt;mind blast&lt;/strong&gt; is the
usual psychic damage + daze combo, but it happens a little less often (recharge
6+). Once per encounter it can focus its powers and issue the &lt;strong&gt;Call of Thoon&lt;/strong&gt;
(ranged 10 vs. Will), which does heavy psychic damage and pulls the target up to
10 squares so it ends up adjacent to the hulk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the hulk dies, it triggers a &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Explosion&lt;/strong&gt;, which covers a Close
Burst 2 and inflicts ongoing 15 psychic damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hulks are excellent front-liners, and the Call of Thoon also allows them to pull
a PC squishy into Eviscerate range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elder-brain&quot;&gt;Elder Brain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Elder Brains are the big bosses of a medium-to-large
illithid enclave. They rule with absolute authority and live in ooze vats that
amplify their powers and allow them to communicate with their subjects over vast
distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to an elder brain’s vat is an adventure in itself, since it will
inevitably be in the most secure and heavily guarded part of a sizable illithid
enclave. Once there, the PCs will have to contend with the brain itself and with
whatever bodyguards are in the chamber with it. Elder Brains are usually too
arrogant to run away from a fight, though they may change their tunes after
their bodyguards are taken down and they’re reduced to low HP. However, getting
there is harder than it looks, because not only can the brain fight, it can also
&lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elder Brains are Large Aberrant Magical Beasts with the Blind keyword. They have
Blindsight 10 and are immune to the blinded condition and to gaze attacks. They
have a ground speed of 2 and a teleport speed of 6, which I think is a first in
the game - earlier edition brains were pretty much confined to their vats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brains are Level 23 Elite Controllers with 436 HP. They start off with a host of
passive traits. The first, &lt;strong&gt;Warp Reality&lt;/strong&gt; is an aura (5) that deals 10 damage
to any enemy that teleports while inside. The second, &lt;strong&gt;Absorb Thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;,
grants the brain a saving throw or recharge roll whenever a non-minion ally
drops to 0 HP within 10 squares. And the third, &lt;strong&gt;Unseeing Telepathy&lt;/strong&gt;, allows
it to communicate telepathically even when it doesn’t have line of effect to the
other creature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warp Reality’s effect doesn’t care whether it was the enemy who initiated the
teleport, or if someone else teleported the enemy. Damage happens either
way. This is important because most of the elder brain’s attacks teleport the
target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic melee attack is a Reach 3 &lt;strong&gt;Tentacle Warp&lt;/strong&gt;, which does light physical
damage, teleports the target 3 squares, and immobilizes them for a
turn. &lt;strong&gt;Flailing Warp&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to make three such attacks in a single
action, each against a different target. Instead of a mind blast, they have a
&lt;strong&gt;mind burst&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), which targets all enemies in a Close Burst 5 with
the usual effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also use &lt;strong&gt;Sensory Overload&lt;/strong&gt; as a minor action, which works almost
identically to the mind burst. It does a little less damage, and instead of
dazing it blinds and deafens for a turn &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; teleports the target 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, every time the elder brain successfully saves against an effect,
&lt;strong&gt;Baleful Transfer&lt;/strong&gt; automatically afflicts an enemy within 5 squares with the
effect the brain just saved against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stats seem to reward aggressive tactics. All of the brain’s attacks have a
range that’s equal or less than that of its aura, so it wants to fight from
close range. It will probably try to teleport to be near the PC’s squishier back
line, using Tentacle Warps to keep them close and to keep defenders away. It
also has enough melee reach to fight from behind a wall of soldiers or brutes,
and pairs well with other enemies that inflict forced teleports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the mind flayers here have interesting mechanics, and I particularly like
this edition’s take on the elder brain as a highly mobile close-range
combatant. It’s probably the last thing your players will expect if they’re used
to the more static depiction from other editions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mimics have been in the game since its beginning, and are are one of D&amp;amp;D’s most
iconic monsters. They’re also notable for originating within D&amp;amp;D and “breaking
out” to become a popular monster in other games and media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image of a trasure chest growing teeth and eating the hapless adventurer
trying to open it is a popular classic even within D&amp;amp;D’s own implied
setting. Everyone knows it, and most think it’s a pretty funny joke. Everyone
but those who have actually gone through this and survived the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mimics are highly intelligent creatures originating from the Far Realm. Despite
their intelligence they don’t seem to be interested in friendly relations with
other sapients, and are mostly interested in using their smarts to fool and eat
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth edition mimics also take over the “murderous alien shapeshifter” role
from doppelgangers, which as we saw before are now mostly just people. You see,
the classic chest mimic is actually a juvenile individual. As it matures, it
gains the ability to absorb the memories of the people they devour and to take
their shapes. These impersonator mimics infiltrate mortal society, moving around
and taking different shapes as they feed. They reproduce by budding. Their spawn
spend a time joined to the mass of their parent before setting out on their own
as object mimics. In an emergency, the parent can reabsorb them for a quick
burst of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mimics rarely seek out alliances, but they often enter a symbiotic relationship
with inedible monsters like constructs or incorporeal undead. The mimic will
lure victims to the other monster’s lair, and help with the fight so it can eat
the bodies later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mimics are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts. They have Resist Acid 5/tier,
Darkvision, and Tremorsense 5. Their signature ability, of course, is
&lt;strong&gt;Shapeshift&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability allows a mimic to switch between Ooze and Object forms. In Ooze
form, it gains the standard Ooze ability to ignore all penalties for squeezing
through small spaces. In object form, it can’t attack but gains Resist 10 to all
damage and others must succeed at a Perception check to notice it’s a mimic. The
DC varies with the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;object-mimic&quot;&gt;Object Mimic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, this is a junevile of the species and the one PCs are most
likely to meet first. It’s a Level 8 Lurker with 71 HP, Speed 5, and all
standard traits listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These mimics have an &lt;strong&gt;Ambush&lt;/strong&gt; trait that gives them 2d6 bonus damage on all
attacks against surprised victims. The creature has two attacks beyond its basic
&lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;Crushing Tendrils&lt;/strong&gt; do light physical damage, grab the target (with
a -5 penalty to escape) and inflict ongoing 15 acid damage while the grab
lasts. &lt;strong&gt;Ravening Maw&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) does heavy physical damage and slows (save
ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either of these special attacks would make a good opener against a surprised
victim, benefitting from combat advantage and from bonus Ambush damage. The
Perception DC to pierce the mimic’s disguise is 24. They usually take forms that
are enticing to their potential prey - a treasure chest is a classic for luring
adventurers, but any other Medium object will do. Berry bushes, fancy statues,
comfy chairs…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impersonator-mimic&quot;&gt;Impersonator Mimic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an older specimen that specializes in impersonating its victims and
infiltrating mortal society. Unlike the monstrous doppelganger of editions past,
impersonator mimics are more interested in &lt;em&gt;food&lt;/em&gt; than in political power. Their
main goal at any given time alternates between staying hidden and luring their
next victim to an isolated spot. They can use psychic powers to help with those
goals, in addition to their shapeshifting and mundane deception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impersonator Mimics are Level 16 Controllers with 160 HP. The impersonator’s
&lt;strong&gt;Shapeshift&lt;/strong&gt; ability allows them to take humanoid form in addition to the two
standard ones. This form gives them a +4 bonus to Bluff and allows them to use
all languages known by the last person they killed. The DC to pierce any of the
impersonator’s disguises is 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its attacks are the usual &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt;, and a pair of psychic powers. &lt;strong&gt;Forcible
Conversion&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) is a non-damaging melee power that attacks Will
dominates its target (save ends). &lt;strong&gt;Call to Harvest&lt;/strong&gt; (minor action) is a
non-damaging ranged power that also attacks Will. On a hit, it slides the target
4 squares and makes it grant combat advantage for a turn. Finally, as a free
action, they can &lt;strong&gt;Absorb&lt;/strong&gt; a mimic spawn that’s adjacent to them or occupying
their space. This kills the spawn and gives them 1 Action Point. This does make
it one of the few regular monsters with access to action points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that only the object form forbids the mimic from attacking - they can use
all of these abilities in humanoid form without having to shapeshift, and they
can Absorb in any form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mimic-spawn&quot;&gt;Mimic Spawn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very young mimic that hasn’t left the “care” of its parent yet. It can already
shapeshift into objects, and it can also meld into its parent’s form for
protection and increased stealth. This does make it susceptible to being
re-absorbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spawn are Level 16 Minion Lurkers, which make them suitable for hanging out with
impersonator mimics. Not every impersonator will have spawn, but those who do
will be a bit more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;One With Master&lt;/strong&gt; trait represents the spawn’s ability to merge with its
parent. A merged spawn occupies the same space as the parent, cannot attack, and
cannot be targeted or take damage. Up to four spawn can meld to a single
impersonator. Their only attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; that does average damage for a
minion of this level. The DC to pierce their object disguise is 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just gotta have mimics available in a D&amp;amp;D game. I don’t think I’ve ever used
one, but I feel good just knowing that they exist. I guess it took the authors
a long time to come up with cool mechanics for their shapeshifting, which is why
it took a while for them to asppear appear in 4e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level mechanics make it seem that mimics start their lives pretty good at
shapeshifting and get worse at it for a while before reaching their former level
of skill, but that’s just a mechanical artifact. Levels can be adjusted freely -
you could easily have lower-level spawn and higher level object mimics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Meenlock</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-meenlock.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one from the 1e Fiend Folio, though its lore is new for this edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A monster is considered “aberrant” in 4e when their origins or workings are
heavily tied to the Far Realm. Usually this means they come from the Far Realm,
but that’s not the case with meenlocks. Meenlocks are the victims of an alien
disease, and it’s this disease that comes from that horrible place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Known as Meenlock Corruption, it eventually changes its victims into naked mole
rat/crab hybrids like those in the illustration. Meenlocks gather together in
subterranean lairs built in caves, ruins, or in the shallow Underdark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These lairs usually have relatively easy access to the surface, with at most an
easily-rolled boulder blocking their main entrance. The creatures themselves
scatter and hide when their lairs are invaded, fighting only when cornered. All
of this is because their main defense is Meenlock Corruption itself. Anyone who
enters their lairs is exposed to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the corruption progresses, it dominates the victim’s mind and compels them to
return to the lair where they were infected. If such a victim spends more than
two days in there, they turn into a new meenlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meenlocks are driven to seek new victims as well - that’s how they increase
their numbers. To that end they can ally with other creatures who are themselves
resistant to their infection, in exchange for victims who are not. Potential
allies include foulspawn, or powerful evil wizards and psions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text of the book is a bit confusing but it looks like it’s possible to
restore someone who was turned into a meenlock. You need to kill the creature,
burn its body, and then apply the Remove Affliction and Raise Dead rituals to
the remains. How’s that for an extreme treatment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by detailing the &lt;strong&gt;Meenlock Corruption&lt;/strong&gt; disease. It’s a Level 9
Disease, with an improve DC of 20, and a Maintain DC of 15. Unlike most other
diseases, its resistance rolls use Insight instead of Endurance. Stage One
inflicts a -4 Will penalty. Stage Two makes the victim grant combat
advantage. Stage Three makes the victim become dominated by the meenlocks who
infected it, and driven to return to their lair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual for 4e diseases, when you reach Stage Three you stop making resistance
rolls to improve. A Remove Affiction ritual might be able to save the victim if
performed before the transformation is complete. Otherwise you need the more
drastic procedure described above (kill them, burn the body, Remove Affliction,
Raise Dead).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meenlocks themselves are Small Aberrant Humanoids with Speed 5 and
Darkvision. Their signature ability is Dimension Step (recharge 4+), a move
action that allows them to teleport 8 squares. All of them fight with their
claws and with a suite of mental powers blending fey magic and aberrant
psionics. The specifics vary per individual stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meenlock-stalker&quot;&gt;Meenlock Stalker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalkers possess powers that make them particularly suitable for the gathering
of new victims. They’re Level 9 Controllers with 97 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combat, a Stalker will first and foremost try to forge a &lt;strong&gt;Horrid Link&lt;/strong&gt;
(minor action, recharge 4+) with a victim. It has a range of 10 squares and
happens automatically. Whenever the stalker takes damage, the linked victim
takes 1d10+5 damage. The link lasts for a turn or until the stalker uses the
power again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stalker can then use two powers against the linked victim. Both are ranged
attacks targetting Will and inflicting light psychic damage, with different
rider effects. &lt;strong&gt;Maddening Whispers&lt;/strong&gt; dazes (save ends). And &lt;strong&gt;Twisting
Whispers&lt;/strong&gt; force the victim to make a basic attack against a creature of the
stalker’s choice. It also exposes the victim to Meenlock Corruption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; are simple basic attacks with average damage, so stalkers have
an incentive to stay away from the PCs and work solely through the Horrid
Link. Their default goal in a fight is to infect as many PCs as possible with
Meenlock Corruption, though they might have others depending on who they’re
allied with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meenlock-corruptor&quot;&gt;Meenlock Corruptor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one trades damage potential for increased control. It’s devastating to
party cohesion in both defensive and offensive ambushes. It’s a Level 11 Lurker
with 89 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, its &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; are simple basic attacks. The star of the show here is
&lt;strong&gt;Corrupting Mind&lt;/strong&gt;, a very complex at-will ranged attack. It deals no damage
itself, but does a lot of other things. First, it exposes the target to meenlock
corruption. Then, it inflicts a custom condition named Mental Disarray (save
ends). A target affected by this is considered dominated, gains 2d6 bonus damage
to all attacks, and is unable to see the corruptor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failing the first save against mental disarray makes the condition last until
the end of the encounter! Whenever a victim in this state takes more than 10
damage, the meenlock corruptor takes the same amount, and the victim can make a
saving throw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter the corruptor can also use a &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Shriek&lt;/strong&gt; to hit a
close blast 5, dealing psychic damage and knocking targets prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, another dominator that’s worse than a succubus. Since Corrupting Mind
is at-will, it’s possible that the whole party would get dominated at once when
fighting a corruptor. The more of them you add to a single encounter, the bigger
the chance of this happening. Once a target is dominated for the encounter, Team
Monster should avoid attacking them. It’s up to the PCs to do those 10+ damage
to their mind-controlled friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another disease-themed monster that tackles its theme in a creative
manner. Not many diseases use Insight instead of Endurance. Your beefy
Endurance-trained defenders will get a nasty shock if the party doesn’t figure
this out before exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, both of them are quite dangerous. PCs fighting an all-meenlock
encounter group will spend as much time attacking each other as they will
fighting the monsters. The corruptor is particularly terrifying in this
regard. If possible, avoid using more than one of those in an encounter group
unless you want your PCs to really suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
