        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: New Neverwinter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, Lord Dagult Neverember of Waterdeep has recently arrived in
Neverwinter at the head of a mercenary force with the intent of rebuilding the
city and re-establishing order and trade. He claims descent from one of Nasher
Alagondar’s bastard sons, saying this gives him the right to take over the
city. Alagondar was the ruler of Neverwinter at the time depicted in the
computer games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“New Neverwinter” is a concept Neverember’s propaganda machine came up with to
stir nationalistic sentiment among the populace and get them on-side. This, and
the practical results of his rebuilding efforts, have worked on the majority of
the city’s residents, but some of them consider the idea of a “new Neverwinter”
to be an insult to the city’s memory. Chief among these dissenters are the Sons
of Alagondar, militant rebels who oppose Neverember and have been clashing often
with his forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of what we’ve seen so far points to Neverember being a villainous
character, whose claim is fake and whose rule would be selfish and
oppressive. But there’s a text box here that reminds us that not even this is
set in stone. Lord Neverember’s role in a specific campaign is entirely up to
the GM. His claim might be true or false, his intentions might be altruistic or
selfish, and his rule could end up being good or bad for the region, and all of
these “switches” are independent from each other. Also independent from all of
this is the attitude of the PCs towards him - you still have a meaty campaign
whether they want to support or topple the lord, and there are plenty of other
things to occupy them if they’re indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neverember’s main goal is of course to &lt;strong&gt;Claim the Throne&lt;/strong&gt;. He is effectively
in charge of that portion of the city his faction controls, but running the city
and wearing its crown are very different things. Neverember’s current plan is to
make the people love him. He’s going to improve their lives so much that they’ll
beg him to become their lord, claim or no claim. Mwa-ha-ha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Dagult will still have a much easier time of it if he can &lt;strong&gt;Prove his
Disputed Heritage&lt;/strong&gt;. He knows his word is not enough to prove his claim, so he’s
been hiring scholars and explorers to look for documents that support it among
the city’s ruined archives and libraries. He’s also not above hiring those same
scholars to &lt;em&gt;fabricate&lt;/em&gt; such documents, and has burned more than one book that
had a less-than-helpful stance on his ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While seeking the crown, Neverember still has to actually &lt;strong&gt;Run the City&lt;/strong&gt;, to
&lt;strong&gt;Maintain His Position&lt;/strong&gt; as the Open Lord of Waterdeep, and he also never loses
sight of the whole reason he’s doing all of this, which is to &lt;strong&gt;Make Hard
Coin&lt;/strong&gt;. In order to juggle all of this, he delegates heavily. General Sabine,
who commands the mercenary army, is in charge of policing and defending the
territory he controls in the city. He appointed a dwarf named Soman Galt to act
as mayor and oversee tax collection, grants of property, and other paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the same reason, he loves to &lt;strong&gt;Hire Sellswords&lt;/strong&gt; to care care of problems
that require more discreet solutions. This includes looking for proof of his
claims and spying on the opposition as mentioned above, but it also includes
&lt;strong&gt;Finding Gauntlgrym&lt;/strong&gt; because having that as a feather on his cap would
increase his chances of being declared king by popular acclaim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;player-character-tie-ins&quot;&gt;Player Character Tie-Ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PC with the Neverwinter Noble background is Dagult’s greatest nightmare:
someone with a stronger claim to the throne of the city. He will either try to
deal with the obstacle by sending mercenaries to spy on or assassinate the
character, or by trying to publicly discredit them once the discreet approach
becomes impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Harper Agent was also sent here to oppose Neverember, but as the campaign
starts they’ve just realized nothing is as it seems. Are they proceeding with
their original mission, or deviating from it now that the Harpers’ original
intel proved to be woefully incomplete?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs with the Oghma’s Faithful theme would be eager to take part in any genuine
fact-finding expedition about Dagult’s lineage (or that of his
rivals!). However, their devotion is to the truth rather than to any mortal
lord, and the truth they find can end up drawing the ire of either Dagult
himself or his enemies, depending on whether it contradicts or supports his
claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on his exact moral disposition in the campaign, Neverember could be
either a potential sponsor or a rival to the Heir of Delzoun in the search for
Gauntlgrym.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs without direct connections to this storyline might still find New
Neverwinter a ready source of miscellaneous mercenary jobs when they need some
extra cash and XP. In addition to being the hired swords for the above plots,
they could also bolster the faction’s efforts to evict the orcish army that has
taken part of the city ruins, or get hired to investigate the numerous
mysterious events in town that point to the other major factions, like
spellplagued monster attacks or mysterious disappearances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;faction-relationships&quot;&gt;Faction Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Neverwinter has no idea the &lt;strong&gt;Abolethic Sovereignity&lt;/strong&gt; is behind those
monster attacks. They’re causing these to keep the surfacers distracted while
they carry on their experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Ashmadai&lt;/strong&gt; managed to secure a tenuous alliance of sorts with New
Neverwinter. Dagult doesn’t know who they are beyond “a shady but influential
cult”. He uses them as an occasional source of deniable muscle, and they’re hard
at work subverting and corrupting his underlings with the goal of eventually
inducting the man himself among their ranks. Their leader, Mordai Veil, is
currently attempting to seduce General Sabine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was received a few reports of &lt;strong&gt;Thayans&lt;/strong&gt; in the region, and has tasked
General Sabine with finding out more. She has yet to deliver her first report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dagult is completely ignorant of &lt;strong&gt;Netherese&lt;/strong&gt; operations in the region and has
unwittingly hired Shadovar agents as assassins before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you decide to make the lord himself something other than a villainous
asshole, there are a lot of events in motion that could lead him and his faction
in that direction. They’re heavily infiltrated by both diabolists and abolethic
agents! PCs seeking to support or co-opt New Neverwinter are going to have a
harder job ahead of them than those who try to destroy it. They’re also in the
dark about the Thayans and Netherese as the campaign starts, and might be
blindsided by either of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still think Dagult and friends work better as villains, either by themselves
or as an eventual tool of someone worse. Making them neutral or sympathetic
would however be a good way to take New Neverwinter out of consideration if the
party is not interested in tangling with it, making it a part of the background
noise.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Factions and Foes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This chapter starts the GM-focused part of the book. The factions presented here
are the “other half” of all the plots hinted at in the character themes -
they’re what the themes are hooking into. This chapter will contain a lot of
information players won’t know at the start of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are five major factions operating in the Neverwinter region during this
campaign:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Neverwinter&lt;/strong&gt;: Dagult Neverember and his mercenary army, who want to
become the legitimate rulers of the city.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abolethic Sovereignity&lt;/strong&gt;: A sect from this aberrant empire is experimenting
with a pocket of the Spellplague beneath the city with the eventual goal of
using it to control the sleeping primordial Maegera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A cult of Asmodeus worshipers, also known as &lt;strong&gt;Ashmadai&lt;/strong&gt;, is plotting to take
over the region for themselves but is in for a whole bunch of nasty surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Thayans&lt;/strong&gt; want to create an undead army and possibly complete their
genocidal plans from thirty years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Netherese&lt;/strong&gt; want to repair the flying island of Xinlenal and use it as
the center of their new empire.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from these, there are many other smaller factions centered around either
the city of Neverwinter, like the rebel remnants, or around the Neverwinter
Wood, like the Uthgardt or the angry eladrin of Ilyianbruen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each major faction gets their own section consisting of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A general overview of who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A detailed explanation of their goals. This includes text boxes with Theme
Tie-Ins that could lead the faction to interact with the PCs or
vice-versa. Some are obvious, others less so.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A summary of their relationship to other major factions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A discussion of what encounters against them look like, complete with
statistics for their important figures and any new monsters that might make up
their rank-and-file.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the introduction says, everybody’s levels are calibrated to fit in a
Heroic-tier campaign, and none of the plots and goals detailed here are set in
stone. Some of the faction descriptions include text boxes musing about
alternate setups, or what happens if the faction’s plots are seriously derailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minor factions get less space for themselves, but they still get some and
we’ll be looking at all of them in the order they appear on the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each major faction is going to be split into two posts here. The first will look
at their general description, goals, relationships, PC tie-ins and my
impressions of them. The second will deal with the Encounters section of their
writeup, which tends to be pretty long and often includes new monster stat
blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wealth in D&amp;D and Dungeon Fantasy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I’ve done pretty often these past few years is converting D&amp;amp;D and
Pathfinder adventures for use with Dungeon Fantasy (either version). These
conversions didn’t have nowhere near the level of rigor of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/&quot;&gt;Dragon’s
Dogma&lt;/a&gt; adaptation, but that larger project did give me a solid grounding on
the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Converting from one tabletop system to the other is fairly easy, for the most
part, but there are some aspects of it that I found harder to do, especially on
the fly. One of these is converting wealth between the two systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I’ll be comparing the Dungeon Fantasy RPG and Pathfinder 1st
Edition and trying to come up with a way to convert monetary amounts from the
latter to the former. I chose the DFRPG because I use its monetary system in my
games, and I chose Pathfinder 1e because I want to convert Hell’s
Rebels. Pathfinder 1e, of course, shares most of its base assumptions with D&amp;amp;D
3.5, the system from which it is derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-money-looks-like&quot;&gt;What Money Looks Like&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dungeon Fantasy purposefully makes its coins have the exact same dimensions as
those of D&amp;amp;D, and therefore Pathfinder. They both use chunky standardized coins
that weight 1/50th of a pound (around 10 grams). These come in copper, silver,
gold, and a few other exotic materials that we don’t need to look at right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These dimensions are apparently universal standards, and their value comes from
their precious metal content. If you find a chest of thousand-year-old gold
coins in an ancient dungeon, you can carry them back to town and spend them on
the market right away. Finding “non-standard” coins is usually a rare special
case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, though their physical dimensions are identical, their values seem
to be derived from completely different assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-money-buys&quot;&gt;What Money Buys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all variants of GURPS, Dungeon Fantasy expresses its prices and values in
“GURPS dollars”, or “$”. The exact value of this unit of currency varies with
the setting. Here, $1 is the worth of a copper piece. Silver pieces are worth 20
copper pieces each ($20). Gold pieces are worth 20 silver pieces each
($400). This means GURPS is effectively on a copper standard. The vast majority
of Dungeon Fantasy characters gets $1000 to buy their starting gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Pathfinder we have the classic decimal setup where 1gp == 10sp == 100cp. The
most common coin is the gold piece, and nearly everything in the core book’s
gear chapter has its price expressed in gp. So here we’re on a &lt;em&gt;gold&lt;/em&gt;
standard. Starting money is determined by a random roll that varies per
class. Fighter-types start with an average of 175gp, others start with less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, this starting money is meant to let you buy your main weapon,
perhaps a backup or shield, a suit of armor, and the miscellaneous sundries that
make up your typical adventurer’s kit: a pouch or pack, some camping supplies
and rations, and maybe some tools like the thief’s lockpick set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there on out, things start to diverge quite sharply, and the way I see it
it’s mainly the fault of Pathfinder’s Wealth By Level table. It subjects PCs to
the tyranny of inflation. This plus the difference in base value means that
while a haul of a thousand gold pieces is a fantastic fortune for even veteran
Dungeon Fantasy delvers, it starts out at “pretty nice” for low-level Pathfinder
adventurers and quickly becomes “pocket change” for high-level ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-whats-our-exchange-rate&quot;&gt;So What’s Our Exchange Rate?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can start with the guidelines presented in the Exploits book: an adventure
should pay at least enough for the party to recoup their expenses with
consumables, power item recharge, and the cost of staying in town during
downtime. It’s perfectly OK for it to pay more than that, even &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more than
that, because it’s relatively easy to get rid of “excess” money by giving them
opportunities to spend it. Maybe a weird old man has a treasure map to sell, or
a mystical artifact or something. Magic items don’t count as part of character
wealth for this, as the game’s attitude to them is more similar to early D&amp;amp;D
than modern Pathfinder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after all of that I think we can safely say that a Pathfinder 1e gold piece
should be worth around &lt;strong&gt;$5&lt;/strong&gt; in Dungeon Fantasy. This leads to amounts of money
that are sufficient to cover expenses with a little left over in low-level
adventures, and to increasingly bigger hauls in higher-level ones, but as we
established that’s OK. Some of those Pathfinder adventures even helpfully
provide us with domain mini-games of their own that can soak up that extra cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;performing-the-actual-conversion&quot;&gt;Performing the Actual Conversion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that basic exchange rate in mind, we can think about how that affects the
actual treasure our delvers find in the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coins&quot;&gt;Coins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Piles of coins change to reflect their new value. The two main approaches you
could take here are to prioritize keeping the same value, or prioritize keeping
the same weight (which means keeping the same number of coins). Getting &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;
value and weight to match is very hard, so I strongly recommend sticking to only
one unless you like solving &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem&quot;&gt;multi-dimensional knapsack problems&lt;/a&gt; in your
spare time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing &lt;strong&gt;value&lt;/strong&gt; means those coin piles will end up smaller and lighter
than the originals. This will make hauling them off easier. I recommend against
condensing the pile as much as possible, because you don’t want to make
logistics &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; easy. Also, finding a single gold coin can be a bit of a letdown
even if it is worth a lot. This is the easiest approach to take on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing &lt;strong&gt;the number of coins&lt;/strong&gt; means the pile will have exactly the same
size and weight, but it will be made of a smaller denomination coins. Its actual
value will probably be a little higher or lower than that of the original, but
that’s OK as long as the value remains close. This could lead to a situation
where the group only takes the most valuable portions of the pile, but I guess
that’s true to how it was done in Old D&amp;amp;D too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example&lt;/strong&gt;: A chest containing 100gp in Pathfinder should contain $500 in coins
when converted to DF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritizing value might give us a bag containing 25 silvers. That’s a
satisfying number of coins that still has a non-negligible weight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Prioritizing weight might give us a chest containing 80 coppers and 20
silvers, with a total worth of $480.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gems-jewelry-and-art-objects&quot;&gt;Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things tend to have pretty arbitrary values in both systems! The biggest
difference in how they handle selling this stuff in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pathfinder, you can generally exchange them for their full listed value in
cash, making them perfectly efficient forms of portable wealth. PF adventurers
are quite likely to convert their coins into fancy jewelry when they need to
travel long distances, since it’s much lighter for its value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Dungeon Fantasy, the only thing that fetches its full value is coin or bulk
precious metals. Everything else, including gems, jewelry, and art objects, is
subject to the rules for appraisal and haggling. This means typical delvers are
likely to get less than full value for this stuff back in town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendation here is to use a doubled exchange rate: each gp of gems,
jewelry and treasure is worth $10. That’s the treasure’s &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; value, which
means a typical party will get half of that on average when they sell it back in
town. I feel this preserves the “original intention” of the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;magic-items&quot;&gt;Magic Items&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both systems have a lot to say about magic item pricing, so my strategy here is
to not attempt a conversion of the price at all. I convert the &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; of the
item and figure out how much that would cost in Dungeon Fantasy if it was a new
item. Saying it like this makes it sound easy, but this can be complex enough to
warrant its own post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an item can be replicated with the standard enchantments from DF, it has
those enchantments and is priced accordingly. Items with unique functions might
be a bit harder, but I always have the “easy escape” there of just not assigning
a fixed price to these. Like DR Artifacts, they’re either impossible to sell in
the first place, or will be worth some arbitrary amount that matches what I want
the PCs to have at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Hell's Rebels Adventure 3, Part 3</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell's_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we come to the final part of our Let’s Read of the third Hell’s Rebels
adventure, “Dance of the Damned”. With the “regional support” missions complete,
the Rebellion’s stats can grow to their maximum values. We’re almost at the
point where things get real serious in Kintargo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revolution starts with a party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-5-the-ruby-masquerade&quot;&gt;Part 5: The Ruby Masquerade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barzilai Thrune has been organizing a grand masquerade ball to be hosted at the
Opera House ever since the start of this adventure. He advertises it as a way to
reconcile with his critics and to show everything is fine in Kintargo, but of
course it’s a dastardly trap. After the PCs close the Menador Gap he steps up
his time table and announces a date for the event. He might also end up doing it
on his original schedule if the PCs take too long to complete that key mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His plan is to use a troop of dottari and disguised devils to massacre the
ball’s attendants at the party’s climax, and doctor the evidence to blame the
Silver Ravens. This will give him an official excuse to begin hunting them down
in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barzilai sends invitations to every noble or other prominent citizen he knows
does not support him. He’s not stupid enough to believe the PCs would attend if
he invited them directly, so he makes invitations relatively easy to acquire by
other means as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s at this point that the private investigator Tayacet Tiora makes contact
with the PCs. Barzilai had hired her to look into the Silver Ravens, and it’s
even possible they ran into her in previous adventures if the GM decided to use
that scene. This time, she’s found out enough to become convinced the PCs are in
the right, and she comes to warn them that the Masquerade is a trap. Her
recommendation is for the PCs to not attend, but she promises to help if they
insist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply not going is certainly an option. It ensures the safety of the PCs but
lets the trap spring on the innocent guests unopposed. The book also
contemplates the possibility that the PCs will want to break into the Opera
House early, which is actually a good call. The same security forces will be
present and they will be patrolling more aggresively, but there will be no
bystanders. The PCs would miss out on a few extra hob-nobbing opportunities but
would be in a much better tactical position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the adventure assumes the PCs do attend, however. It should be
fairly easy to get invitations for the whole party plus any allies they wish to
take. Tiora will also attend in this case, and be ready to help if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Masquerade starts at 9 PM, and whatever day is most convenient for the
GM. The PCs should have ample time to prepare for this one, growing the
rebellion and aiming their NPC teams at the Opera House to provide
information. It’s even possible to plant an infiltrated saboteur among the
guards. With good rolls they should have a pretty good idea of the security
inside the place, and an extra ally on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;party-mechanics&quot;&gt;Party Mechanics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual ball is a bit of a skill challenge in the same vein as the Vyre
banquet. There’s an official dress code: outfits should include the color red,
everyone must wear a mask, and both should be fancy. Fortunately they can pass
anything up to medium armor and shields as part of the costume, but it’s
definitely worth it to have it adorned and to splurge on extravagant
masks. These give bonuses to social skills during the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like we had Banquet Points in Vyre, here we have Masque Points. PCs start
with an amount between 4 and 16 depending on how fancy their costumes are. NPC
allies they bring with them also affect this total. The ball is split into
half-hour segments, and each PC can perform one of several available actions
during this span of time. Some of these actions cost Masque Points, some can be
used to acquire more with good skill rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless the PCs have been making an effort to ingratiate themselves with the
noble houses during “strategic” play, this is their last real chance to do so
before things heat up. The Kintargo-aligned house heads should all be here, so
the party’s socialites can identify them and chat them up. Having to do this now
does add a layer of complication to the procedures, which is why I like the idea
of introducing this element early in the campaign instead and let players make
their own interaction opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opera-house-layout-and-security&quot;&gt;Opera House Layout and Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Opera House has three floors and an extensive basement. The main seating
areas had all of their seats removed to host the ball. Most guests stay on the
ground floor, but the nobles gravitate towards the second floor balcony because
they like to look down on commoners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two floors have a lot of backstage areas off to the sides, and the
third floor and basement are all “backstage”. Many of these areas were converted
in living spaces for Barzilai and his staff. All backstage areas are off-limits
to party guests, so PCs need to be sneaky when exploring them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a total of 22 dottari in the house, half of which attend to the guests
while wearing smiley masks. The other half stands in reserve, waiting for the
trap to spring. The dottari here use the same stats as the Menador soldiers,
with slightly different gear. This means the PCs should be able to handle small
groups of them just fine - the challenge is doing so without raising an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also a troop of devils in here: two bone, six bearded, and a single
erinyes. One of the bone devils, Crizmerkis, has a few class levels on him and
is wearing an illusory disguise to look like Barzilai. The real Thrune has
relocated to the temple of Asmodeus, and does not appear in this adventure. The
other bone devil is in the orchestra pit, using his illusion magic to provide
the music for the ball. The remaining monsters are scattered through several
side rooms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the rooms also contains suspended cages for Barzilai’s pet cockatrices,
which can be released at the press of a switch. Unless the PCs or an ally break
the switch, these creatures will be released when the trap is sprung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are a bunch of secret rooms in a sub-basement that used to belong
to the original Silver Ravens. Barzilai is using them to stash his treasures and
house his “prize” henchthings. Former Mayor Jilia Bailinus sleeps here as a
vampire, and the long-missing singer Shensen is also here as a statue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of additional secret chambers Thrune’s lackeys haven’t been
able to find, and which contain valuable Silver Ravens stuff. This includes the
crypts for the original Ravens, which confirm their fates and the fact that
Jackdaw, the last remaining member, might still be alive. And it also includes
the musical score for the Song of Silver, a potent ritual that will greatly help
the PCs in the climax of the rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using rebellion actions the PCs can arm themselves with plenty of information
before going in: a Covert Action can give them the map to the whole building,
even the secret-secret chambers with a good enough roll. And a Sabotage action
can place an infiltrator among the dottari. Once the PCs link up with the
infiltrator during the party, they can learn the composition and location of the
place’s entire security detail, devils included. The saboteur can also break the
cockatrice release switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several rooms that are noted as being rarely visited by both guests
and patrols, which makes them perfect places to hide bodies. So yup, time to
Assassin’s Creed it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delving-the-masquerade&quot;&gt;“Delving” the Masquerade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say those covert actions are so vital that the GM should push for them
to happen if the players have been neglecting that aspect of the game. The PCs
are on the clock here and every little advantage helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party starts at 9PM. At 10PM, they have a special “Dance of the Damned”
event that takes up half an hour. At midnight an unmasking ceremony happens and
Crizmerkis springs the ambush with the aim of killing every single guest in the
house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs should carefully manage their masque points, with some of the party making
an effort to mingle and gain more while the rest spend them on exploration
actions. It’s important that the minglers manage to maintain the point total
above 0, and that the explorers avoid raising a general alarm. Either of these
things will cause Crizmerkis to spring the trap immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participation on the dance is optional, but winning the contest gives a ton of
Masque Points so the minglers will want to participate. This leaves them with 5
other segments on which to decide their actions before the trap is sprung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explorers who refuse to take part in the contest have 6 segments on which to
act. Their priority target here should be taking out the dottari, because
they’re weaker and have less means of raising the alarm (several of the devils
are telepathic and can do so instantly). The less enemies there are at midnight,
the easier the final fight will be. Looting and detailed exploration of the
basement should wait until after the main ambush force is defeated. There are a
few extra monsters down there that will not take part in the ambush, so they can
be safely ignored for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-stroke-of-midnight&quot;&gt;The Stroke of Midnight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At midnight, Crizmerkis (disguised as Barzilai) will stop the music and make an
ominous speech. During the speech, the dottari will split into 11 pairs and
stand guard over every one of the building’s exits, locking those doors in the
process. Attacking them before the speech is done will cost the party a bunch of
Masque Points but will give them a surprise round and a tactical advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist of the speech is that the guests present here have graciously
volunteered themselves to help maintain public order, by being massacred so the
blame can fall on the Silver Ravens and Barzilai can go after them. As soon as
it ends, the devils attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 300 guests in the house, not counting the PCs. The “spare” bone devil
and the erinyes will focus on slaughering them, while the bearded devils and
Crizmerkis will come for the PC directly. Most of them will be disguised as good
outsiders using illusions, but additional summoned devils and such will not have
disguises on. The PCs can draw the attention of the bone devil and erinyes by
engaging them in combat. If cornered, Crizmerkis might summon the vampire Jillia
Bailinus to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why killing the dottari early helps: if there are less of them, they’re
going to leave some of those exits unlocked and unprotected. The PCs &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; open
the exits so guests can leave: 1d6 guests escape every round for every unlocked
exit. With no open exits, 2d6 of them die every round to sheer crushing crowd
pressure. Those two devils kill even more per round if left alone. If you’re
using GURPS, read “every round” as “every six seconds”, otherwise things might
get a little impossible here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;results-and-consequences&quot;&gt;Results and Consequences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event will go down in history as the Ruby Massacre. Whether the PCs or
Thrune are blamed for it depends on how well they do in this final fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs win the big fight they should have plenty of time to explore the rest
of the opera house. They’ll get to fight a pack of hellhounds being used as
guard animals in the basement, find Vampire Jilia’s coffing and stake her, and
find Shensen and the Song of Silver. There’s also a lot of other cool loot to be
had, including a scroll of resurrection that can be used to bring the former
Mayor back to life after she’s destroyed as a vampire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs loose, they’ll find themselves waking up inside a cell in Castle
Kintargo. Either way as soon as they leave the opera house we transition
directly to Volume 04, where we go full Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Notes and Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book makes that final battle sound quite difficult, particularly if the PCs
didn’t prepare for it by coming into the party armed and taking out some of the
opposition ahead of time. Even if they did, it’s going to be hard to save all
the bystanders. Dungeon Fantasy delvers should have it a bit easier because
the GURPS version of these opponents won’t have HP in the triple digits, but
it’s going to be tough even for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same emphasis on etiquette from the Vyre banquet is present here, but here
it makes less sense given the surrounding context. The Silver Ravens only get
diplomatic/strategic benefits from thwarting the ambush if they have more than
20 Masque Points by the time the ambush starts. I guess this is supposed to
represent the final impression left on the survivors about who is to blame for
the massacre, but it feels odd to have the party save these people in a very
obvious manner and not be recognized for it. I’d say that saving the heads of
the noble houses at least should be more than enough to get them on-side for the
next adventure, if that hasn’t happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs have been buttering up the nobles on their own initiative prior to
this point, then the best strategic decision they can make is to break into the
opera house days before the ball, preferrably during daylight hours so the
vampire isn’t a factor. All the same enemies will still be there, but the whole
party can focus on exploring the area and taking them out. They’ll completely
forfeit the possible diplomatic rewards from the Masquerade, but not having to
split their focus between delving and socializing or rescuing bystanders is more
than worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tl-dr&quot;&gt;TL; DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play a swordmage or hexblade instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard of bladesingers back in the days of 2e, when they were first
introduced as an elf-only character kit that gave a lot of powerful combat
bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a member of a couple Brazilian RPG mailing lists where people either loved
or hated them. Their fans were also elf fans in general, and their haters were
usually GMs who thought it made the character “too anime”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never actually read the original bladesinger writeup, so I didn’t take sides
in that fight. But having read the Bladesinger class as presented in the 4e
Neverwinter Campaign Setting, I have to say I’m not their greatest fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re probably the greatest departure from the design principles established
in the PHB classes, far more extreme in that regard than even the Essentials
classes from the “Heroes” books. They feel very much like a return to the design
philosophy of previous editions. Or perhaps they’re “foreshadowing”: while 5e
hadn’t come out yet when this book was published, it was probably already in
development, and one of its major goals was to recapture the feel of those
older editions. In either way, they feel very dissonant to me when placed
alongside other 4e classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book spends a whole page describing bladesingers as the epitome of elven
superiority. The text feels like it was written by a sun elf. The term
Tel’Quessir is used a lot here but not explained. I assume it means “the elven
people”, but I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the book, the art of the Bladesong was developed by Corellon
himself, and has been passed down among the elven people for an untold number of
their extremely long generations. Even among elves, few individuals are worthy
of receiving its teachings, for one must have the mind of a great wizard and the
agility of a great dancer to even comprehend its awesomeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their techniques are passed directly from master to student, and were never
written down anywhere. When the last bladesinger dies, so does the mystery and
beauty of their art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All bladesingers are completely devoted to upholding and defending the ways of
the Tel’Quessir, for such is the purpose Corellon gave them. Few bladesingers
deign to leave their homelands - those who do so are surely in pursuit of some
mission or relic vital to the Tel’Quessir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See those last three paragraphs? They’re almost direct quotes from the book. I’m
barely paraphrasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-information&quot;&gt;Basic Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bladesingers are presented as a Wizard subclass, which is the kind of
presentation I would expect to see in 5e but not here. The book says you should
play one of them if you want to be someone who can both participate in melee
combat and cast arcane spells. So you could perhaps see them as the Essentials
version of the Swordmage, at least in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, they’re described as arcane controllers, because of the “wizard
subclass” thing, and they get Striker-like HP and healing surges. They still get
the wizard’s +2 to Will, and a fairly large list of class skills: Acrobatics,
Arcana, Athlethics, Diplomacy, History, Intimidate, Nature and Perception. A
bladesinger’s key abilities are Intelligence and Dexterity, in that
order. They’re proficient with cloth and leather armor, with all simple and
military weapons, and with wizard implements (wand, orb, staff).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the only class in the entire edition that seems to have a hard
racial requirement: no self-respecting Bladesong master would teach it to anyone
who is not an elf or eladrin. Once in a great while, a half-elf might earn the
honor, but even that’s a bit scandalous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eladrin are pretty much ideal bladesingers since they get bonuses to both Int
and Dex. Other Int/Dex ancestries are likely to be just as effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;powers-and-features&quot;&gt;Powers and Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a full 30-level writeup for the class. Like the other Essentials classes,
this one comes with an exclusive Paragon Path (Sorcerous Sword) and you have no
reason to pick anything else. You have a little more freedom of choice for your
epic destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;level-1&quot;&gt;Level 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an incredibly front-loaded class, with a very long list of level 1
features. They all have slightly different requirements to work, but the
combined result this: you want to wear at most light armor, and you want to
wield a light or heavy blade in one hand, and either a wand or nothing at all in
the other. Let’s call this the Bladesinger Requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do fulfill the Bladesinger Requirement, you can use your the following
list of benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You use Int instead of your Strength for both attack and damage when making
 basic melee attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You gain a +2 shield bonus to AC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t provoke opportunity attacks when using ranged or area attacks. This
is a bit less awesome than it sounds because of how your powers work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use your sword as an implement for powers that require one. As usual
in these cases, you don’t add its proficiency bonus to the attack roll, but
you do add its magic item bonus to attack and damage, and its critical dice
when you score a critical hit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then pick three Bladespells from a set of six - these are your at-will
powers, and they all work the same. They don’t use actions, and trigger when you
hit an enemy with a melee basic attack while fulfilling the Bladesinger
Requirement. Each is a Ranged 10 attack that does automatic (Dex Mod) damage of
a different elemental type and has a different controller-y rider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dancing Fire&lt;/strong&gt;: Fire damage, target grants CA until the end of your next
turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dazzling Sunray&lt;/strong&gt;: Radiant damage, target has -2 to attack until the end of
your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frost Bite&lt;/strong&gt;: Cold damage, target is slowed until the end of your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lighting Ring&lt;/strong&gt;: Lightning damage, target gets damaged again if they move
before the end of your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Sever&lt;/strong&gt;: Necrotic damage and you knock target prone if it’s the same
size as or smaller than the target of the triggering melee attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unseen Hand&lt;/strong&gt;: Force damage and you slide the target 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the bonuses above, Bladespells don’t provoke an opportunity attack.
They also don’t have to target the same creature you just hit, but you can only
use one of them per attack. Their damage increases by 2 per tier past
Heroic. Looks like Shadow Sever and Unseen Hand are more or less automatic picks
here, their riders are much better. The third pick would depend on your party’s
abilities and what benefits them the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not done with the Level 1 powers yet. You get three cantrips chosen from
the traditional list of Prestidigitation, Ghost Sound, Mage Hand, Light and
Suggestion. And then you get the errataed version of Magic Missile, the one that
always hits for minimal force damage. That’s another spell I like more in its
PHB 1 form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, you get the Bladesong encounter power. If you’re fulfilling the
Bladesinger Requirement, you can use this as a minor action to slip into a fancy
bullet time trance that gives you a +2 power bonus to attack rolls and all
defenses, and a +5 power bonus to damage rolls. This lasts until the end of your
next turn, which means you can get 2 turns’ worth of Bladesong if you use it as
your first action on your turn. There is no other way to extend its
duration. The word &lt;em&gt;rolls&lt;/em&gt; there means it doesn’t benefit your bladespells or
Magic Missile, but it does affect your basic attacks and spells that have damage
rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spellcasting-and-the-rest-of-the-levels&quot;&gt;Spellcasting and the Rest of the Levels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That huge list of level 1 stuff seems pretty nifty, and there’s so much of it!
Unfortunately it also represents most of what you’ll be doing through your whole
career, because the rest of your powers are kinda underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with spellcasting, the main reason why this is presented as a wizard
subclass and also the main way in which it breaks from this edition’s usual
class design philosophy. You see, bladesingers bring Vancian spellcasting back
to 4e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They get to pick encounter and utility powers as they advance in level, but
these are treated much like wizard spells were in 3e instead of being a set of
class-specific powers. While their possible choices are all detailed in the
class description, they are also literally “taken from the wizard spell list” in
that they’re copied from that class’s list of powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a table showing at which levels they learn new spells. At set levels,
they get to pick either two encounter attack spells or two utilities to add to
their spellbook. After finishing a long rest, a bladesinger can prepare a number
of these spells, detailed in another table. There is no mention of replacing
spells with higher level ones as you level, so I guess they just accumulate in
your spellbook. A level 1 bladesinger knows 2 encounter attack spells and can
prepare 1. A level 30 character knows 14 encounter attack spells and 10
utilities, and can prepare 3 and 5 of them respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say “encounter attack spells”, and they get presented in red boxes, but
they’re only encounter powers for standard wizards. A bladesinger treats them
all as &lt;em&gt;dailies&lt;/em&gt;, and even gets them when other characters would normally get
daily powers. This means the level of the powers lags behind your character
level. At level 5, you pick from a list of level 3 wizard powers, and so on. So
yeah, even “spell level differs from character level” makes a comeback
here. Your reward for reaching level 20 is that you get to pick a single spell
from a list of actual daily attack powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utility powers are less wonky. You get them at the same levels as everyone else,
their level matches yours when you get them, and their frequency of use actually
matches the one in their descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the levels where other characters would get encounter powers, you gain new
class features. These either make your bladespells a little better, or give you
extra bonuses and triggered abilities that only work while your Bladesong is
active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanics-wise, bladesingers feel like the many 3e attempts at making a class
equally skilled at swordplay and magic. Like them, it gives us a class that’s
not that good at either thing as a specialist, and as a result might feel less
powerful and fun in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re labeled as controllers, but they’re not great at it. The majority of
their control ability is going to come from their three bladespells, which will
usually only affect one enemy at a time. They need to wait until level 24 to be
able to target multiple enemies with a bladespell, and they can only do that
once per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those “encounter as daily” Vancian spells can let them exert more control, but
they’re weaker and scarcer than what a “proper” controller of the same level has
access to. In a party with a wizard, invoker, or psion, the bladesinger will be
overshadowed as a controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re better when viewed as strikers. Bladesong’s bonuses to basic attacks and
damaging spells provide an appreciable damage increase. However, I don’t think
they do so as consistently as the powers and features of a dedicated striker
class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conclusion here is the same one I added to the helpful TL; DR section at the
start of this post: play something else. Like a swordmage, for example! These
great PHB-style arcane defenders do a much better job of letting you play
someone who is equally skilled at swordplay and magic. Their lore is also far
less snobbish, though you can still call your swordmage a bladesinger if you
want without changing anything about their mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swordmages can be found in the 4e Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, which as a
bonus includes a lot of information on the wider world of Toril where
Neverwinter is located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you want to be a elf-flavored striker, you could go with a fey
pact Hexblade warlock, who can be found in Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms. One
of the characters labeled as a bladesinger here was in fact a hexblade warlock
in that book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story-wise, I guess they intended this to be the class of choice for the
Iliyanbruen Guardian, but I would probably choose Swordmage even so. The only
thing that could make me play a bladesinger would be if I could something other
than an elf or eladrin, just so I could make fun of the snobbish flavor text. A
pixie from the Player’s Guide to the Feywild would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bladesinger class is the last section of Chapter 2. In our next post we’ll
begin looking at the GM-focused material of Chapter 3, &lt;strong&gt;Factions and Foes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Torm, the Loyal Fury, seems to be your typical “paladinic” god of justice and
honor. His warpriests pursue justice in an unjust world and act with honor
towards those who have none. His domain is by far the most recommended for the
other FR gods, being applicable to any god who has a militant or compassionate
bent, from Bahamut to Ilmater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics&quot;&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warpriests of Torm are pretty much Wisdom-based warlords. Their riders boost
ally attacks and defenses or allow quick repositioning, in much the same way the
different warlord powers do. The optimization forums say this is probably the
most varied domain around in terms of what it lets you do - it’s hard to get
bored playing a warpriest of Torm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that jumped out to me is their Level 1 utility power, which they get
to keep throughout their whole careers: &lt;strong&gt;True Strike&lt;/strong&gt;! This is an &lt;em&gt;at-will&lt;/em&gt;
power that lets them spend a Standard action to grant a +4 bonus to an ally’s
next attack. It’s not quite as fun as the Lazy-Lord’s signature ability, but
it’s the closest you can get to it in an Essentials-only campaign. It’s also
super-useful for setting up big attacks with encounter or daily powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as in FR, this power set could fit a lot of different core deities. The
lore’s focus on justice make it a good fit for Bahamut and Moradin, and the
tactical nature of its powers could allow it to stand in for the domains of
non-Good “strategist” gods like the unaligned Erathis or the evil Bane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for domains. Next we’ll look at a full class, the infamous
bladesinger.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Selûne Domain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Selûne is the FR goddess of the moon, and is quite an important figure in the
setting’s pantheon. She originally created the world alongside her sister Shar,
the goddess of darkness. Together they also witnessed the “fissure of reality”
that split that world in two, Abeir and Toril. That fissure is the reason why
the Realms were Forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shar is responsible for a lot of evil shit throughout FR’s metaplot, including
the events that happened during the Spellplague/edition transition to swap bits
of Abeir’s and Toril’s geography around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selûne used to be a goddess who took the path of forgiveness, compassion and
self-sacrifice, but the last century has seen her become more aggressive and
proactive in battling evil. Light must battle darkness if it is to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book doesn’t suggest using her domain for priests of any other FR god. I
don’t think any of them are moon-themed enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics&quot;&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warpriests of Selûne benefit from having a high Constitution, since a lot of
their power riders use the bonus for that attribute. These riders usually focus
on granting allies damage resistance or bonus damage, and in penalizing enemy
damage or attack rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her signature damage type is “cold and radiant”, which means PCs can potentially
benefit from two of the edition’s most infamous feat combos (Permafrost and
Radiant Mafia). That’s the domain’s greatest feature according to the
optimization forums. It helps that their Channel Divinity power makes enemies
vulnerable to radiant damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of radiant damage makes this domain powerful against undead, which is true
for most others. Its Level 1 Utility is a daily that makes the warpriest’s
weapon count as silvered for the entire encounter, also making it a good counter
to lycanthropes. As we saw on the character themes, there are quite a few of
those among the possible foes in the Neverwinter campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think this would be an appropriate domain for clerics of Sehanine in
the core setting, but I think this version of Selûne is a bit more aggressive
and militant than the trickster-ish Sehanine Moonbow. Corellon’s domain would
fit her better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could say this is the domain for priests who worship Sehanine’s wrathful
face, perhaps. And it’s a good pick for any player who wants their central
concept to be “fighting evil by moonlight”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Hells Rebels 3, Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell's_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series! Go to the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/&quot;&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt; to see all entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s continue our reading of Dance of the Damned! I expect this to be the
second of three posts for this adventure. In the last one, we covered two
chapters of the book. Let’s aim for two more here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-3-the-vyre-accord&quot;&gt;Chapter 3: The Vyre Accord&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vyre is a city located in the same province as Kintargo. There’s a whole
mini-guide on it attached to the book, but the only thing we really need to know
is that it’s pretty much Fucked-Up Fantasy Venice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though technically part of Cheliax, Vyre is almost entirely independent. Cheliax
tolerates this because the city is a prime vacation destination for Chelish
elites. On the other hand, Vyre’s slice of coast makes for a shitty port, so
they’re almost entirely reliant on nearby Kintargo for the sea trade that gets
them most of their food and luxuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vyre’s government is extremely self-interested, but Cheliax has good reasons to
maintain good relations with them, and they have good reasons to maintain good
relations with Kintargo. If Vyre backs the rebellion, they can exert pressure on
those Chelish elites to back off from the province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allies-and-information&quot;&gt;Allies and Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advance information on the city comes from two sources. Captain Sargaeta, whom
the PCs befriended in Adventure 02, can tell them the basics, and give them a
ride there on his ship. Molly Mayapple can provide them with extensive and
invaluable advice on their actual goal in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCs haven’t met Molly yet, but they should have recovered a bunch of
documents belonging to her from the Lucky Bones. These are deeds for a set of
waterfront warehouses, which were stolen by the extinct Gray Spiders decades
ago. Even though Molly has since rebuilt her fortune (she owns a successful
hotel), she’s still going to be extremely grateful when the PCs hand the deeds
back to her, and will provide a lot of insider information and help. They can
track her down from the information on the deeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-basics&quot;&gt;The Basics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vyre is ruled by five monarchs, each tasked with an aspect of government. The
one they want to meet is Manticce Kaleeki, the Queen of Delights, who is in
charge of the city’s economy and foreign relations. Vyre’s laws are simple yet
baroque, creating an environment where non-lethal duels and eternal feuds are
common, all sales are final, but prejudice of any sort is frowned upon. However,
you can get away with anything if you follow the last and most important rule:
don’t get caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Queen of Delights is set to host a banquet in the near future, and that will
be the PCs’ opportunity to talk to her. The GM determines how long the PCs have
until the banquet. Most of this time is probably going to be spent looking for
outfits, gifts, and information, but the GM can also introduce a few Vyre
sidequests to spice things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-banquet&quot;&gt;The Banquet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Banquet might be an entirely non-violent scene, but it’s as difficult to
navigate as any dungeon. Vyre high-society etiquette is weird, and the Queen of
Delights heaps even more weird on top of that because she’s basically Morticia
Addams as a Tiefling in Fucked-Up Fantasy Venice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molly’s help is absolutely vital here. The book doesn’t even mention how the PCs
get invited to the banquet, but I assume she’s instrumental in arranging
invitations for them and for herself. She’s also an excellent source of
information on the complex etiquette surrounding the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This starts with what to wear and what gifts to bring. Molly knows what the
Queen likes, and PCs good at gathering information might learn about Manticce’s
less well-known preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are nine other guests in the banquet aside from Molly and the PCs. We get
personality notes for each one. Most are only sources of roleplaying color, but
one of them will be important in the next adventure: Hei-fen, former
guildmistress of the Gray Spiders. Tough it’s been decades since she escaped the
destruction of that guild, she’s still a spiteful old wererat and is angry at
the PCs for stealing “her home”. She’s here to size them up for future reprisal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other “special” guest, not counted among those nine, is the Queen’s long
dead husband, whose skeleton adorns one of the table’s chairs. The correct move
here is to not acknowledge poor Gomez in any way. To do so is considered crass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While roleplaying should be first and foremost in this scene it also has a
mechanical component. The banquet is effectivelly a long and colorful skill
challenge. PCs get a number of starting “banquet points” depending on how they
dress, what gifts they bring, and whether or not they participate in a standing
ovation when the Queen appears (they should!). After that, each course in the
banquet allows them several opportunities to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is a knowledge skill test to identify the dish in question and how to
eat it (probably &lt;strong&gt;Area Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Current Affairs&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Savoir-Faire&lt;/strong&gt; in
GURPS). Careful PCs can just wait for one of the other guests to start eating
and skip the skill test, but succeeding shows they know what they’re doing and
earns them a point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is a series of tests to actually eat the course, which varies with
each dish. There’s no way to skip this one, though the PCs doesn’t need to
succeed at them all to earn a point. If they do, they earn extra. If they fail
badly enough or just decide to forgo rolling and eat the thing wrong on purpose,
they lose points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is a social skill test to do well in the conversation that accompanies
that dish. This would likely be &lt;strong&gt;Fast-Talk&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/strong&gt; or even &lt;strong&gt;Public
Speaking&lt;/strong&gt; in GURPS, modified by what the players actually say. Success makes
them come off as smooth operators and earns points. Failure loses points and
leaves them embarrassed. Again careful characters can just keep quiet and skip
this part, but it earns them nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dishes range from the merely bizarre to the horrific:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We start with &lt;strong&gt;quicksoup&lt;/strong&gt;, a bowl of boiling hot soup accompanied by a water
bowl containing five small live fish and a set of peculiar utensils. This
requires tests involving manual dexterity to properly poach the fish in the
soup and eat them. Probably plain &lt;strong&gt;DX&lt;/strong&gt; modified by &lt;strong&gt;Manual Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; in
GURPS, though I’d also let a daring PC test &lt;strong&gt;Surgery&lt;/strong&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next is &lt;strong&gt;Galtan Squash&lt;/strong&gt;, which looks like a severed head but is just a
carved pumpkin full of extremely spicy red soup. This is a straight-up
Fortitude save/&lt;strong&gt;HT&lt;/strong&gt; roll to endure the spice. A bad enough failure leaves
your face swollen and penalizes your talky rolls for the rest of the feast!
I’d probably let it be modified by &lt;strong&gt;Resistant to Poison&lt;/strong&gt; and other
advantages that include it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you get the &lt;strong&gt;Unseen Feast&lt;/strong&gt;, meat pies made from the flesh of an
invisible stalker. I’m pretty sure invisible stalkers are sapient, which makes
this the most horrific dish of the lot. It’s quite possible some PCs will
refuse to eat this one on moral grounds. Those who decide to forge ahead need
to be fast and perceptive. They have to eat the invisible meat before it turns
visible and loses its flavor. PCs who can see invisibility can pass this one
automatically, though it’s considered crass to cast a spell for it while on
the table. Others must succeed at a difficult &lt;strong&gt;Perception&lt;/strong&gt; check, which I
guess I would modify for &lt;strong&gt;Acute Smell/Taste&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, you get &lt;strong&gt;Sweefats With Honey Sauce&lt;/strong&gt; for dessert. Sweetfats are
candied spiders - this is an Underdark dish. The most difficult thing here is
opening the honey sauce container, which is a mundane replica of a
Hellraiser-style puzzle box. Time to break out the &lt;strong&gt;Thaumathology&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Lore (Demons)&lt;/strong&gt; skills, though I guess &lt;strong&gt;Traps&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/strong&gt;
might also work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether Vyre allies with the Silver Ravens or not depends entirely on how many
banquet points the characters manage to get. They need at least 20. A party of 5
who arrives properly dressed will start out with 10, and might get a few more
from bringing optimal gifts. Even so, they will still need to take active part
in at least some of the banquet in order to succeed at the mission. I’d probably
give them a sign that they succeeded once they get enough points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the party succeeds, the Queen might invite the individual who gained them the
most points for an intimate night. Ties go to the prettiest or most charismatic
PC, and if they’re still tied she invites all of the tied PCs. If the party has
more than 30 points &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the propositioned PC(s) accept Manticce’s invitation,
she will also offer the group her personal alliance, providing extra mechanical
boosts to the strategic rebellion layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Notes and Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part is very different than what you would expect from a standard dungeon
fantasy adventure. It can be really fun for PCs who like role-playing, so even
in a condensed approach I’d recommend keeping it. If you want to make the Unseen
Feast part less objectionable, you could perhaps say the “meat” is gelatinous
cube jelly, which is almost as hard to see and doesn’t come from something
sapient. And if you don’t want to feature sexual themes at all in the adventure,
you could remove Manticce’s invitation at the end and just say that the party
gets her personal support if they get more than 30 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside when using GURPS is that if your PCs are overly focused on dungeon
delving they might not have the skills necessary to cause a good impression
here. In this case I suggest being generous: if none of the delvers has the most
appropriate skill, ask for a roll on the closest skill one of them does have, or
perhaps even roll against DX or IQ. That said, characters who followed the tips
from the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2017/05/01/hells-rebels-player-guide.html&quot;&gt;Player’s Guide&lt;/a&gt; or who used earned points to become a bit sneakier
and more social shouldn’t have too much trouble covering their bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-4-breaking-the-menador-gap&quot;&gt;Part 4: Breaking the Menador Gap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Menador Gap is a mountain pass in the mountains separating Ravounel from
central Cheliax. It’s the only viable route for marching an army through those
mountains, so it must be closed. The PCs start the adventure at level 7, and the
book says they should be level 8 before tackling this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap is protected by a fortress named Menador Keep. It used to be an old
dwarf fort, but is now occupied by Chelish military. Rexus, who studied those
old Silver Raven documents extensively, can tell the PCs that there’s a dwarven
self-destruct mechanism deep within the bowels of the fort. The PCs’ goal here
is to get to that mechanism, activate it, and get out. This will demolish the
fort in a way that ensures the pass is completely closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s theoretically possible to demolish the fort from a distance using spells
like Earthquake, but a) this might not block the pass completely and b) it will
bury all the sweet loot located inside the fortress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dungeon-menador-gap&quot;&gt;Dungeon: Menador Gap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fortress itself has two above-ground floors and an underground level. Its
ground floor contains a courtyard with two large gates on either side, which
blocks the mountain pass. Inside the building are a large number of guard posts,
utility/storage rooms, and a couple of monster pens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fort is defended by a garrison of 23 soldiers, commanded by Lucien Thrune, a
wyvern-riding cavalier. He also has a bound erinyes devil with him, and a very
unhappy bound jann servant. Another devil acts as a stationary sentry at the
entrance to the treasury. The soldiers are weak individually, but dangerous in
large groups. They wear mail and are armed with halberds and crossbows, favoring
ranged attacks over melee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to handle this might be as a Metal Gear-like stealth mission. The
PCs are very likely to have the necessary magic to turn the whole party
invisible and levitate them for a short time. Clever PCs might find the entrnce
to the wyvern’s stable down on the cliffside and enter through there, bypassing
a lot of the security measures on the surface. The same technique might allow
them to land atop the fort’s battlements and begin from there, bypassing the
courtyard kill box. Even if they immediately go loud and begin a frontal
assault, they’ll begin doing that from a hugely advantageous position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third-best option is for them to disguise themselves as someone authorized
to cross the Gap and ride into the courtyard, from which they can force their
way into the fort. It’s less than ideal because they can be targetted by
crossbow and ballista fire from the battlements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting an overt assault will sound a general alert and have every soldier
converge on the party’s position. It’s easier to deal with them piecemeal,
though that might require magic to prevent the sounds of fighting from spilling
out. Stealth might also allow the party to fight the “elites” (Lucien, his
wyvern, the devils) while they’re alone and isolated. The jann servant, Zorumar,
is a potential ally here. He can’t do anything against his master directly, but
he can give all sorts of information about enemy locations and the layout of the
fort, including all secret doors. Killing Lucien will set Zorumar free, and he
will return in the future to gift the party with magic items in thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a secret door in the fort’s armory leading to the ancient dwarven
mechanism in the “basement” level. The only one of its current inhabitants who
knows about this is Zorumar.  The device, called the Anvil of Unmaking, is
protected by ancient guardians and traps, some of which can be bypassed by
proper prayers to the dwarf god Torag and by diplomacy. Activating the
contraption will cause it to completely destroy the fortress in 10 minutes. The
PCs have that long to run away and get clear. Also the tremors and rumbling will
definitely put every remaining enemy in the place on high alert, if they weren’t
already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loot-wise, the most valuable places to hit here are the treasury (obviously),
the war room, and Lucien Thrune’s person. Lucien has a sweet flaming sword, lots
of bling, and the key to the treasury chest. The treasury has a bunch of magical
gear and the fort’s payroll. And the war room has an extremely valuable dagger
lying around next to a pile of important strategic documents full of classified
Chelish military info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes-and-impressions-1&quot;&gt;Notes and Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good old tactical espionage action romp, with the potential to turn into a
wonderfully chaotic battle if the PCs trip the alarm. It’s likely to be the most
time-consuming scene in the entire adventure, and could conceivably take more
than one session to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest playing the enemies with a modicum of intelligence here, but remember
that raising the alarm is not an automatic action. If a single guard spots the
PCs, the rest of the fortress won’t automatically know they’re there. An alarm
must be raised, which takes time and is susceptible to disruption from the PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Oghma Domain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Oghma is the Forgotten Realms god of knowledge, occupying the same conceptual
slot as Ioun does on the default 4e setting. His purview includes knowledge,
inspiration, and discovery. His followers believe that to serve him is to serve
the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stats for this domain can also be used for priests of the god Gond, which I
think is an artificer god?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics&quot;&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oghma’s powers focus on boosting allies’ skill checks by granting them bonuses
or rerolls, and on penalizing enemy attacks and saves. Its main distinction from
other domains is that its attack powers focus on doing &lt;em&gt;psychic&lt;/em&gt; damage instead
of Radiant, though one of your at-wills still does radiant and thunder damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old character optimization forums rate this domain as pretty good, though
they say it takes until the mid-Paragon tier to really get going: its level 11
feature makes that radiant and thunder at-will immobilize on a hit, and its
level 16 one makes your Healing Word grant the target a free basic attack. You
should still be able to do just fine in a standard Heroic-only Neverwinter
campaign, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, this theme combos well with the Oghma’s Faithful. The
domain’s first-level feature lets you use Wisdom to make Int-based skill checks,
and the skill-boosting abilities from the theme will let you easily become the
party’s encyclopedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have much to say about this domain that hasn’t been said above
already. Oghma isn’t a particularly exciting FR deity to me, though this
campaign does give his clerics some pretty nice hooks. The domain’s powers could
easily be used for priests of Ioun in a campaign in the core setting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Corellon Domain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the default 4e setting, Corellon is the universal god of spring, beauty and
the arts, and also the patron of arcane magic. In Forgotten Realms, his original
setting, he is the head of the elven pantheon. His portfolion includes all of
the above plus nature, war, and most other things elves care about. All of his
worshippers are elves or eladrin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warpriests of Corellon are known as Fey Wardens, and take it as their holy
mission to both protect elves and their culture, and also promote and spread the
greatness of that culture. I don’t think he wants non-elves to worship him, he
just wants non-elves to know elves are better than them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stats for this domain can also be used for priests of other elven gods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics&quot;&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most other Warpriest domains are melee-only, but Corellon’s weapon powers can be
used with either melee or ranged weapons. This means the theme is designed to
take advantage of the racial weapon proficiencies elves and eladrin get, and is
particularly suited to moon or sun elves who replace Eladrin Education with Elf
Weapon Proficiency. They get proficiency with both the long sword and the long
bow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its ranged attack emphasis, the domain’s powers also focus on
granting extra mobility to the cleric’s allies, with a secondary focus on making
enemies easier to hit by either nullifying cover or granting allies combat
advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old character optimization forums say this is the domain that relies on
Constitution the least, so players are free to put those points on Dexterity
instead, particularly if they plan on favoring ranged combat or wearing light
armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to cover all of the powers in detail here, but I think the
domain’s two at-wills are fun. Both are melee or ranged weapon attacks using
Wisdom vs. AC and dealing 1W + Wis mod damage. &lt;strong&gt;Blessing of the Wild&lt;/strong&gt; lets the
cleric or an ally within 5 squares shift 1 square as a free action, and
&lt;strong&gt;Graceful Switch&lt;/strong&gt; lets them stow a weapon and draw another as a free action
before making the attack. The latter also deals force and radiant damage, so the
cleric is never without something that can put the hurt on incorporeal undead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the mechanical aspect of this domain, though I’m not a big fan of
the “elves are better than everyone else” mentality in its lore. It’s quite easy
to remove, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This domain’s powers would be very well suited to a core deity like Avandra,
with their flexibility and focus on mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
