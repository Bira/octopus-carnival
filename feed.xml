&lt;h2 id=&quot;tl-dr&quot;&gt;TL; DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play a swordmage or hexblade instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard of bladesingers back in the days of 2e, when they were first
introduced as an elf-only character kit that gave a lot of powerful combat
bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a member of a couple Brazilian RPG mailing lists where people either loved
or hated them. Their fans were also elf fans in general, and their haters were
usually GMs who thought it made the character “too anime”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never actually read the original bladesinger writeup, so I didn’t take sides
in that fight. But having read the Bladesinger class as presented in the 4e
Neverwinter Campaign Setting, I have to say I’m not their greatest fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re probably the greatest departure from the design principles established
in the PHB classes, far more extreme in that regard than even the Essentials
classes from the “Heroes” books. They feel very much like a return to the design
philosophy of previous editions. Or perhaps they’re “foreshadowing”: while 5e
hadn’t come out yet when this book was published, it was probably already in
development, and one of its major goals was to recapture the feel of those
older editions. In either way, they feel very dissonant to me when placed
alongside other 4e classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book spends a whole page describing bladesingers as the epitome of elven
superiority. The text feels like it was written by a sun elf. The term
Tel’Quessir is used a lot here but not explained. I assume it means “the elven
people”, but I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the book, the art of the Bladesong was developed by Corellon
himself, and has been passed down among the elven people for an untold number of
their extremely long generations. Even among elves, few individuals are worthy
of receiving its teachings, for one must have the mind of a great wizard and the
agility of a great dancer to even comprehend its awesomeness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their techniques are passed directly from master to student, and were never
written down anywhere. When the last bladesinger dies, so does the mystery and
beauty of their art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All bladesingers are completely devoted to upholding and defending the ways of
the Tel’Quessir, for such is the purpose Corellon gave them. Few bladesingers
deign to leave their homelands - those who do so are surely in pursuit of some
mission or relic vital to the Tel’Quessir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See those last three paragraphs? They’re almost direct quotes from the book. I’m
barely paraphrasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-information&quot;&gt;Basic Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bladesingers are presented as a Wizard subclass, which is the kind of
presentation I would expect to see in 5e but not here. The book says you should
play one of them if you want to be someone who can both participate in melee
combat and cast arcane spells. So you could perhaps see them as the Essentials
version of the Swordmage, at least in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, they’re described as arcane controllers, because of the “wizard
subclass” thing, and they get Striker-like HP and healing surges. They still get
the wizard’s +2 to Will, and a fairly large list of class skills: Acrobatics,
Arcana, Athlethics, Diplomacy, History, Intimidate, Nature and Perception. A
bladesinger’s key abilities are Intelligence and Dexterity, in that
order. They’re proficient with cloth and leather armor, with all simple and
military weapons, and with wizard implements (wand, orb, staff).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the only class in the entire edition that seems to have a hard
racial requirement: no self-respecting Bladesong master would teach it to anyone
who is not an elf or eladrin. Once in a great while, a half-elf might earn the
honor, but even that’s a bit scandalous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eladrin are pretty much ideal bladesingers since they get bonuses to both Int
and Dex. Other Int/Dex ancestries are likely to be just as effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;powers-and-features&quot;&gt;Powers and Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a full 30-level writeup for the class. Like the other Essentials classes,
this one comes with an exclusive Paragon Path (Sorcerous Sword) and you have no
reason to pick anything else. You have a little more freedom of choice for your
epic destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;level-1&quot;&gt;Level 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an incredibly front-loaded class, with a very long list of level 1
features. They all have slightly different requirements to work, but the
combined result this: you want to wear at most light armor, and you want to
wield a light or heavy blade in one hand, and either a wand or nothing at all in
the other. Let’s call this the Bladesinger Requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do fulfill the Bladesinger Requirement, you can use your the following
list of benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You use Int instead of your Strength for both attack and damage when making
 basic melee attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You gain a +2 shield bonus to AC.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You don’t provoke opportunity attacks when using ranged or area attacks. This
is a bit less awesome than it sounds because of how your powers work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can use your sword as an implement for powers that require one. As usual
in these cases, you don’t add its proficiency bonus to the attack roll, but
you do add its magic item bonus to attack and damage, and its critical dice
when you score a critical hit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then pick three Bladespells from a set of six - these are your at-will
powers, and they all work the same. They don’t use actions, and trigger when you
hit an enemy with a melee basic attack while fulfilling the Bladesinger
Requirement. Each is a Ranged 10 attack that does automatic (Dex Mod) damage of
a different elemental type and has a different controller-y rider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dancing Fire&lt;/strong&gt;: Fire damage, target grants CA until the end of your next
turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dazzling Sunray&lt;/strong&gt;: Radiant damage, target has -2 to attack until the end of
your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frost Bite&lt;/strong&gt;: Cold damage, target is slowed until the end of your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lighting Ring&lt;/strong&gt;: Lightning damage, target gets damaged again if they move
before the end of your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Sever&lt;/strong&gt;: Necrotic damage and you knock target prone if it’s the same
size as or smaller than the target of the triggering melee attack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unseen Hand&lt;/strong&gt;: Force damage and you slide the target 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the bonuses above, Bladespells don’t provoke an opportunity attack.
They also don’t have to target the same creature you just hit, but you can only
use one of them per attack. Their damage increases by 2 per tier past
Heroic. Looks like Shadow Sever and Unseen Hand are more or less automatic picks
here, their riders are much better. The third pick would depend on your party’s
abilities and what benefits them the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not done with the Level 1 powers yet. You get three cantrips chosen from
the traditional list of Prestidigitation, Ghost Sound, Mage Hand, Light and
Suggestion. And then you get the errataed version of Magic Missile, the one that
always hits for minimal force damage. That’s another spell I like more in its
PHB 1 form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, you get the Bladesong encounter power. If you’re fulfilling the
Bladesinger Requirement, you can use this as a minor action to slip into a fancy
bullet time trance that gives you a +2 power bonus to attack rolls and all
defenses, and a +5 power bonus to damage rolls. This lasts until the end of your
next turn, which means you can get 2 turns’ worth of Bladesong if you use it as
your first action on your turn. There is no other way to extend its
duration. The word &lt;em&gt;rolls&lt;/em&gt; there means it doesn’t benefit your bladespells or
Magic Missile, but it does affect your basic attacks and spells that have damage
rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spellcasting-and-the-rest-of-the-levels&quot;&gt;Spellcasting and the Rest of the Levels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That huge list of level 1 stuff seems pretty nifty, and there’s so much of it!
Unfortunately it also represents most of what you’ll be doing through your whole
career, because the rest of your powers are kinda underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with spellcasting, the main reason why this is presented as a wizard
subclass and also the main way in which it breaks from this edition’s usual
class design philosophy. You see, bladesingers bring Vancian spellcasting back
to 4e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They get to pick encounter and utility powers as they advance in level, but
these are treated much like wizard spells were in 3e instead of being a set of
class-specific powers. While their possible choices are all detailed in the
class description, they are also literally “taken from the wizard spell list” in
that they’re copied from that class’s list of powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a table showing at which levels they learn new spells. At set levels,
they get to pick either two encounter attack spells or two utilities to add to
their spellbook. After finishing a long rest, a bladesinger can prepare a number
of these spells, detailed in another table. There is no mention of replacing
spells with higher level ones as you level, so I guess they just accumulate in
your spellbook. A level 1 bladesinger knows 2 encounter attack spells and can
prepare 1. A level 30 character knows 14 encounter attack spells and 10
utilities, and can prepare 3 and 5 of them respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say “encounter attack spells”, and they get presented in red boxes, but
they’re only encounter powers for standard wizards. A bladesinger treats them
all as &lt;em&gt;dailies&lt;/em&gt;, and even gets them when other characters would normally get
daily powers. This means the level of the powers lags behind your character
level. At level 5, you pick from a list of level 3 wizard powers, and so on. So
yeah, even “spell level differs from character level” makes a comeback
here. Your reward for reaching level 20 is that you get to pick a single spell
from a list of actual daily attack powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utility powers are less wonky. You get them at the same levels as everyone else,
their level matches yours when you get them, and their frequency of use actually
matches the one in their descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the levels where other characters would get encounter powers, you gain new
class features. These either make your bladespells a little better, or give you
extra bonuses and triggered abilities that only work while your Bladesong is
active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanics-wise, bladesingers feel like the many 3e attempts at making a class
equally skilled at swordplay and magic. Like them, it gives us a class that’s
not that good at either thing as a specialist, and as a result might feel less
powerful and fun in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re labeled as controllers, but they’re not great at it. The majority of
their control ability is going to come from their three bladespells, which will
usually only affect one enemy at a time. They need to wait until level 24 to be
able to target multiple enemies with a bladespell, and they can only do that
once per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those “encounter as daily” Vancian spells can let them exert more control, but
they’re weaker and scarcer than what a “proper” controller of the same level has
access to. In a party with a wizard, invoker, or psion, the bladesinger will be
overshadowed as a controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re better when viewed as strikers. Bladesong’s bonuses to basic attacks and
damaging spells provide an appreciable damage increase. However, I don’t think
they do so as consistently as the powers and features of a dedicated striker
class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conclusion here is the same one I added to the helpful TL; DR section at the
start of this post: play something else. Like a swordmage, for example! These
great PHB-style arcane defenders do a much better job of letting you play
someone who is equally skilled at swordplay and magic. Their lore is also far
less snobbish, though you can still call your swordmage a bladesinger if you
want without changing anything about their mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swordmages can be found in the 4e Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, which as a
bonus includes a lot of information on the wider world of Toril where
Neverwinter is located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you want to be a elf-flavored striker, you could go with a fey
pact Hexblade warlock, who can be found in Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms. One
of the characters labeled as a bladesinger here was in fact a hexblade warlock
in that book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story-wise, I guess they intended this to be the class of choice for the
Iliyanbruen Guardian, but I would probably choose Swordmage even so. The only
thing that could make me play a bladesinger would be if I could something other
than an elf or eladrin, just so I could make fun of the snobbish flavor text. A
pixie from the Player’s Guide to the Feywild would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bladesinger class is the last section of Chapter 2. In our next post we’ll
begin looking at the GM-focused material of Chapter 3, &lt;strong&gt;Factions and Foes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Torm Domain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Torm, the Loyal Fury, seems to be your typical “paladinic” god of justice and
honor. His warpriests pursue justice in an unjust world and act with honor
towards those who have none. His domain is by far the most recommended for the
other FR gods, being applicable to any god who has a militant or compassionate
bent, from Bahamut to Ilmater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics&quot;&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warpriests of Torm are pretty much Wisdom-based warlords. Their riders boost
ally attacks and defenses or allow quick repositioning, in much the same way the
different warlord powers do. The optimization forums say this is probably the
most varied domain around in terms of what it lets you do - it’s hard to get
bored playing a warpriest of Torm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that jumped out to me is their Level 1 utility power, which they get
to keep throughout their whole careers: &lt;strong&gt;True Strike&lt;/strong&gt;! This is an &lt;em&gt;at-will&lt;/em&gt;
power that lets them spend a Standard action to grant a +4 bonus to an ally’s
next attack. It’s not quite as fun as the Lazy-Lord’s signature ability, but
it’s the closest you can get to it in an Essentials-only campaign. It’s also
super-useful for setting up big attacks with encounter or daily powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as in FR, this power set could fit a lot of different core deities. The
lore’s focus on justice make it a good fit for Bahamut and Moradin, and the
tactical nature of its powers could allow it to stand in for the domains of
non-Good “strategist” gods like the unaligned Erathis or the evil Bane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for domains. Next we’ll look at a full class, the infamous
bladesinger.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Selûne Domain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Selûne is the FR goddess of the moon, and is quite an important figure in the
setting’s pantheon. She originally created the world alongside her sister Shar,
the goddess of darkness. Together they also witnessed the “fissure of reality”
that split that world in two, Abeir and Toril. That fissure is the reason why
the Realms were Forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shar is responsible for a lot of evil shit throughout FR’s metaplot, including
the events that happened during the Spellplague/edition transition to swap bits
of Abeir’s and Toril’s geography around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selûne used to be a goddess who took the path of forgiveness, compassion and
self-sacrifice, but the last century has seen her become more aggressive and
proactive in battling evil. Light must battle darkness if it is to prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book doesn’t suggest using her domain for priests of any other FR god. I
don’t think any of them are moon-themed enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics&quot;&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warpriests of Selûne benefit from having a high Constitution, since a lot of
their power riders use the bonus for that attribute. These riders usually focus
on granting allies damage resistance or bonus damage, and in penalizing enemy
damage or attack rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her signature damage type is “cold and radiant”, which means PCs can potentially
benefit from two of the edition’s most infamous feat combos (Permafrost and
Radiant Mafia). That’s the domain’s greatest feature according to the
optimization forums. It helps that their Channel Divinity power makes enemies
vulnerable to radiant damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of radiant damage makes this domain powerful against undead, which is true
for most others. Its Level 1 Utility is a daily that makes the warpriest’s
weapon count as silvered for the entire encounter, also making it a good counter
to lycanthropes. As we saw on the character themes, there are quite a few of
those among the possible foes in the Neverwinter campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think this would be an appropriate domain for clerics of Sehanine in
the core setting, but I think this version of Selûne is a bit more aggressive
and militant than the trickster-ish Sehanine Moonbow. Corellon’s domain would
fit her better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could say this is the domain for priests who worship Sehanine’s wrathful
face, perhaps. And it’s a good pick for any player who wants their central
concept to be “fighting evil by moonlight”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Hells Rebels 3, Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell's_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series! Go to the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/&quot;&gt;project page&lt;/a&gt; to see all entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s continue our reading of Dance of the Damned! I expect this to be the
second of three posts for this adventure. In the last one, we covered two
chapters of the book. Let’s aim for two more here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chapter-3-the-vyre-accord&quot;&gt;Chapter 3: The Vyre Accord&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vyre is a city located in the same province as Kintargo. There’s a whole
mini-guide on it attached to the book, but the only thing we really need to know
is that it’s pretty much Fucked-Up Fantasy Venice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though technically part of Cheliax, Vyre is almost entirely independent. Cheliax
tolerates this because the city is a prime vacation destination for Chelish
elites. On the other hand, Vyre’s slice of coast makes for a shitty port, so
they’re almost entirely reliant on nearby Kintargo for the sea trade that gets
them most of their food and luxuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vyre’s government is extremely self-interested, but Cheliax has good reasons to
maintain good relations with them, and they have good reasons to maintain good
relations with Kintargo. If Vyre backs the rebellion, they can exert pressure on
those Chelish elites to back off from the province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allies-and-information&quot;&gt;Allies and Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advance information on the city comes from two sources. Captain Sargaeta, whom
the PCs befriended in Adventure 02, can tell them the basics, and give them a
ride there on his ship. Molly Mayapple can provide them with extensive and
invaluable advice on their actual goal in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCs haven’t met Molly yet, but they should have recovered a bunch of
documents belonging to her from the Lucky Bones. These are deeds for a set of
waterfront warehouses, which were stolen by the extinct Gray Spiders decades
ago. Even though Molly has since rebuilt her fortune (she owns a successful
hotel), she’s still going to be extremely grateful when the PCs hand the deeds
back to her, and will provide a lot of insider information and help. They can
track her down from the information on the deeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-basics&quot;&gt;The Basics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vyre is ruled by five monarchs, each tasked with an aspect of government. The
one they want to meet is Manticce Kaleeki, the Queen of Delights, who is in
charge of the city’s economy and foreign relations. Vyre’s laws are simple yet
baroque, creating an environment where non-lethal duels and eternal feuds are
common, all sales are final, but prejudice of any sort is frowned upon. However,
you can get away with anything if you follow the last and most important rule:
don’t get caught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Queen of Delights is set to host a banquet in the near future, and that will
be the PCs’ opportunity to talk to her. The GM determines how long the PCs have
until the banquet. Most of this time is probably going to be spent looking for
outfits, gifts, and information, but the GM can also introduce a few Vyre
sidequests to spice things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-banquet&quot;&gt;The Banquet&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Banquet might be an entirely non-violent scene, but it’s as difficult to
navigate as any dungeon. Vyre high-society etiquette is weird, and the Queen of
Delights heaps even more weird on top of that because she’s basically Morticia
Addams as a Tiefling in Fucked-Up Fantasy Venice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molly’s help is absolutely vital here. The book doesn’t even mention how the PCs
get invited to the banquet, but I assume she’s instrumental in arranging
invitations for them and for herself. She’s also an excellent source of
information on the complex etiquette surrounding the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This starts with what to wear and what gifts to bring. Molly knows what the
Queen likes, and PCs good at gathering information might learn about Manticce’s
less well-known preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are nine other guests in the banquet aside from Molly and the PCs. We get
personality notes for each one. Most are only sources of roleplaying color, but
one of them will be important in the next adventure: Hei-fen, former
guildmistress of the Gray Spiders. Tough it’s been decades since she escaped the
destruction of that guild, she’s still a spiteful old wererat and is angry at
the PCs for stealing “her home”. She’s here to size them up for future reprisal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other “special” guest, not counted among those nine, is the Queen’s long
dead husband, whose skeleton adorns one of the table’s chairs. The correct move
here is to not acknowledge poor Gomez in any way. To do so is considered crass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While roleplaying should be first and foremost in this scene it also has a
mechanical component. The banquet is effectivelly a long and colorful skill
challenge. PCs get a number of starting “banquet points” depending on how they
dress, what gifts they bring, and whether or not they participate in a standing
ovation when the Queen appears (they should!). After that, each course in the
banquet allows them several opportunities to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is a knowledge skill test to identify the dish in question and how to
eat it (probably &lt;strong&gt;Area Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Current Affairs&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Savoir-Faire&lt;/strong&gt; in
GURPS). Careful PCs can just wait for one of the other guests to start eating
and skip the skill test, but succeeding shows they know what they’re doing and
earns them a point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is a series of tests to actually eat the course, which varies with
each dish. There’s no way to skip this one, though the PCs doesn’t need to
succeed at them all to earn a point. If they do, they earn extra. If they fail
badly enough or just decide to forgo rolling and eat the thing wrong on purpose,
they lose points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third is a social skill test to do well in the conversation that accompanies
that dish. This would likely be &lt;strong&gt;Fast-Talk&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/strong&gt; or even &lt;strong&gt;Public
Speaking&lt;/strong&gt; in GURPS, modified by what the players actually say. Success makes
them come off as smooth operators and earns points. Failure loses points and
leaves them embarrassed. Again careful characters can just keep quiet and skip
this part, but it earns them nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dishes range from the merely bizarre to the horrific:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We start with &lt;strong&gt;quicksoup&lt;/strong&gt;, a bowl of boiling hot soup accompanied by a water
bowl containing five small live fish and a set of peculiar utensils. This
requires tests involving manual dexterity to properly poach the fish in the
soup and eat them. Probably plain &lt;strong&gt;DX&lt;/strong&gt; modified by &lt;strong&gt;Manual Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; in
GURPS, though I’d also let a daring PC test &lt;strong&gt;Surgery&lt;/strong&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Next is &lt;strong&gt;Galtan Squash&lt;/strong&gt;, which looks like a severed head but is just a
carved pumpkin full of extremely spicy red soup. This is a straight-up
Fortitude save/&lt;strong&gt;HT&lt;/strong&gt; roll to endure the spice. A bad enough failure leaves
your face swollen and penalizes your talky rolls for the rest of the feast!
I’d probably let it be modified by &lt;strong&gt;Resistant to Poison&lt;/strong&gt; and other
advantages that include it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Then you get the &lt;strong&gt;Unseen Feast&lt;/strong&gt;, meat pies made from the flesh of an
invisible stalker. I’m pretty sure invisible stalkers are sapient, which makes
this the most horrific dish of the lot. It’s quite possible some PCs will
refuse to eat this one on moral grounds. Those who decide to forge ahead need
to be fast and perceptive. They have to eat the invisible meat before it turns
visible and loses its flavor. PCs who can see invisibility can pass this one
automatically, though it’s considered crass to cast a spell for it while on
the table. Others must succeed at a difficult &lt;strong&gt;Perception&lt;/strong&gt; check, which I
guess I would modify for &lt;strong&gt;Acute Smell/Taste&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Finally, you get &lt;strong&gt;Sweefats With Honey Sauce&lt;/strong&gt; for dessert. Sweetfats are
candied spiders - this is an Underdark dish. The most difficult thing here is
opening the honey sauce container, which is a mundane replica of a
Hellraiser-style puzzle box. Time to break out the &lt;strong&gt;Thaumathology&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Lore (Demons)&lt;/strong&gt; skills, though I guess &lt;strong&gt;Traps&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/strong&gt;
might also work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether Vyre allies with the Silver Ravens or not depends entirely on how many
banquet points the characters manage to get. They need at least 20. A party of 5
who arrives properly dressed will start out with 10, and might get a few more
from bringing optimal gifts. Even so, they will still need to take active part
in at least some of the banquet in order to succeed at the mission. I’d probably
give them a sign that they succeeded once they get enough points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the party succeeds, the Queen might invite the individual who gained them the
most points for an intimate night. Ties go to the prettiest or most charismatic
PC, and if they’re still tied she invites all of the tied PCs. If the party has
more than 30 points &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the propositioned PC(s) accept Manticce’s invitation,
she will also offer the group her personal alliance, providing extra mechanical
boosts to the strategic rebellion layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes-and-impressions&quot;&gt;Notes and Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part is very different than what you would expect from a standard dungeon
fantasy adventure. It can be really fun for PCs who like role-playing, so even
in a condensed approach I’d recommend keeping it. If you want to make the Unseen
Feast part less objectionable, you could perhaps say the “meat” is gelatinous
cube jelly, which is almost as hard to see and doesn’t come from something
sapient. And if you don’t want to feature sexual themes at all in the adventure,
you could remove Manticce’s invitation at the end and just say that the party
gets her personal support if they get more than 30 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside when using GURPS is that if your PCs are overly focused on dungeon
delving they might not have the skills necessary to cause a good impression
here. In this case I suggest being generous: if none of the delvers has the most
appropriate skill, ask for a roll on the closest skill one of them does have, or
perhaps even roll against DX or IQ. That said, characters who followed the tips
from the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2017/05/01/hells-rebels-player-guide.html&quot;&gt;Player’s Guide&lt;/a&gt; or who used earned points to become a bit sneakier
and more social shouldn’t have too much trouble covering their bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;part-4-breaking-the-menador-gap&quot;&gt;Part 4: Breaking the Menador Gap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Menador Gap is a mountain pass in the mountains separating Ravounel from
central Cheliax. It’s the only viable route for marching an army through those
mountains, so it must be closed. The PCs start the adventure at level 7, and the
book says they should be level 8 before tackling this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gap is protected by a fortress named Menador Keep. It used to be an old
dwarf fort, but is now occupied by Chelish military. Rexus, who studied those
old Silver Raven documents extensively, can tell the PCs that there’s a dwarven
self-destruct mechanism deep within the bowels of the fort. The PCs’ goal here
is to get to that mechanism, activate it, and get out. This will demolish the
fort in a way that ensures the pass is completely closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s theoretically possible to demolish the fort from a distance using spells
like Earthquake, but a) this might not block the pass completely and b) it will
bury all the sweet loot located inside the fortress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dungeon-menador-gap&quot;&gt;Dungeon: Menador Gap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fortress itself has two above-ground floors and an underground level. Its
ground floor contains a courtyard with two large gates on either side, which
blocks the mountain pass. Inside the building are a large number of guard posts,
utility/storage rooms, and a couple of monster pens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fort is defended by a garrison of 23 soldiers, commanded by Lucien Thrune, a
wyvern-riding cavalier. He also has a bound erinyes devil with him, and a very
unhappy bound jann servant. Another devil acts as a stationary sentry at the
entrance to the treasury. The soldiers are weak individually, but dangerous in
large groups. They wear mail and are armed with halberds and crossbows, favoring
ranged attacks over melee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to handle this might be as a Metal Gear-like stealth mission. The
PCs are very likely to have the necessary magic to turn the whole party
invisible and levitate them for a short time. Clever PCs might find the entrnce
to the wyvern’s stable down on the cliffside and enter through there, bypassing
a lot of the security measures on the surface. The same technique might allow
them to land atop the fort’s battlements and begin from there, bypassing the
courtyard kill box. Even if they immediately go loud and begin a frontal
assault, they’ll begin doing that from a hugely advantageous position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third-best option is for them to disguise themselves as someone authorized
to cross the Gap and ride into the courtyard, from which they can force their
way into the fort. It’s less than ideal because they can be targetted by
crossbow and ballista fire from the battlements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting an overt assault will sound a general alert and have every soldier
converge on the party’s position. It’s easier to deal with them piecemeal,
though that might require magic to prevent the sounds of fighting from spilling
out. Stealth might also allow the party to fight the “elites” (Lucien, his
wyvern, the devils) while they’re alone and isolated. The jann servant, Zorumar,
is a potential ally here. He can’t do anything against his master directly, but
he can give all sorts of information about enemy locations and the layout of the
fort, including all secret doors. Killing Lucien will set Zorumar free, and he
will return in the future to gift the party with magic items in thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a secret door in the fort’s armory leading to the ancient dwarven
mechanism in the “basement” level. The only one of its current inhabitants who
knows about this is Zorumar.  The device, called the Anvil of Unmaking, is
protected by ancient guardians and traps, some of which can be bypassed by
proper prayers to the dwarf god Torag and by diplomacy. Activating the
contraption will cause it to completely destroy the fortress in 10 minutes. The
PCs have that long to run away and get clear. Also the tremors and rumbling will
definitely put every remaining enemy in the place on high alert, if they weren’t
already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loot-wise, the most valuable places to hit here are the treasury (obviously),
the war room, and Lucien Thrune’s person. Lucien has a sweet flaming sword, lots
of bling, and the key to the treasury chest. The treasury has a bunch of magical
gear and the fort’s payroll. And the war room has an extremely valuable dagger
lying around next to a pile of important strategic documents full of classified
Chelish military info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes-and-impressions-1&quot;&gt;Notes and Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good old tactical espionage action romp, with the potential to turn into a
wonderfully chaotic battle if the PCs trip the alarm. It’s likely to be the most
time-consuming scene in the entire adventure, and could conceivably take more
than one session to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest playing the enemies with a modicum of intelligence here, but remember
that raising the alarm is not an automatic action. If a single guard spots the
PCs, the rest of the fortress won’t automatically know they’re there. An alarm
must be raised, which takes time and is susceptible to disruption from the PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Oghma Domain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Oghma is the Forgotten Realms god of knowledge, occupying the same conceptual
slot as Ioun does on the default 4e setting. His purview includes knowledge,
inspiration, and discovery. His followers believe that to serve him is to serve
the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stats for this domain can also be used for priests of the god Gond, which I
think is an artificer god?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics&quot;&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oghma’s powers focus on boosting allies’ skill checks by granting them bonuses
or rerolls, and on penalizing enemy attacks and saves. Its main distinction from
other domains is that its attack powers focus on doing &lt;em&gt;psychic&lt;/em&gt; damage instead
of Radiant, though one of your at-wills still does radiant and thunder damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old character optimization forums rate this domain as pretty good, though
they say it takes until the mid-Paragon tier to really get going: its level 11
feature makes that radiant and thunder at-will immobilize on a hit, and its
level 16 one makes your Healing Word grant the target a free basic attack. You
should still be able to do just fine in a standard Heroic-only Neverwinter
campaign, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might expect, this theme combos well with the Oghma’s Faithful. The
domain’s first-level feature lets you use Wisdom to make Int-based skill checks,
and the skill-boosting abilities from the theme will let you easily become the
party’s encyclopedia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have much to say about this domain that hasn’t been said above
already. Oghma isn’t a particularly exciting FR deity to me, though this
campaign does give his clerics some pretty nice hooks. The domain’s powers could
easily be used for priests of Ioun in a campaign in the core setting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Corellon Domain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the default 4e setting, Corellon is the universal god of spring, beauty and
the arts, and also the patron of arcane magic. In Forgotten Realms, his original
setting, he is the head of the elven pantheon. His portfolion includes all of
the above plus nature, war, and most other things elves care about. All of his
worshippers are elves or eladrin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warpriests of Corellon are known as Fey Wardens, and take it as their holy
mission to both protect elves and their culture, and also promote and spread the
greatness of that culture. I don’t think he wants non-elves to worship him, he
just wants non-elves to know elves are better than them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stats for this domain can also be used for priests of other elven gods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics&quot;&gt;Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most other Warpriest domains are melee-only, but Corellon’s weapon powers can be
used with either melee or ranged weapons. This means the theme is designed to
take advantage of the racial weapon proficiencies elves and eladrin get, and is
particularly suited to moon or sun elves who replace Eladrin Education with Elf
Weapon Proficiency. They get proficiency with both the long sword and the long
bow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to its ranged attack emphasis, the domain’s powers also focus on
granting extra mobility to the cleric’s allies, with a secondary focus on making
enemies easier to hit by either nullifying cover or granting allies combat
advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old character optimization forums say this is the domain that relies on
Constitution the least, so players are free to put those points on Dexterity
instead, particularly if they plan on favoring ranged combat or wearing light
armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to cover all of the powers in detail here, but I think the
domain’s two at-wills are fun. Both are melee or ranged weapon attacks using
Wisdom vs. AC and dealing 1W + Wis mod damage. &lt;strong&gt;Blessing of the Wild&lt;/strong&gt; lets the
cleric or an ally within 5 squares shift 1 square as a free action, and
&lt;strong&gt;Graceful Switch&lt;/strong&gt; lets them stow a weapon and draw another as a free action
before making the attack. The latter also deals force and radiant damage, so the
cleric is never without something that can put the hurt on incorporeal undead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the mechanical aspect of this domain, though I’m not a big fan of
the “elves are better than everyone else” mentality in its lore. It’s quite easy
to remove, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This domain’s powers would be very well suited to a core deity like Avandra,
with their flexibility and focus on mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Warpriest Domains Introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Before we launch into talking about domains, let’s talk about
warpriests. “Warpriest” is the official name for the Essentials version of the
Cleric class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classic PHB Clerics (also known as “Templars” post-Essentials) had a set of
Strength-based melee weapon powers and another of Wisdom-based ranged implement
powers. They were generally discouraged from mixing-and-matching, and over time
the community decided that the Wisdom-based “laser cleric” build was the better
of the two, particularly when you only had the core. There were certain levels
that had no Strength powers in them, a situation that would only be remedied in
supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warpriests are another attempt at a melee cleric - all of their attack abilities
are are Wisdom-based &lt;em&gt;weapon&lt;/em&gt; powers. Warpriest Domains are the solution found
by Essential’s designers to reduce the number of decisions a player must make in
order to play a cleric. Your pick one at character creation, and that determines
not only all of your level 1 powers but also most of the encounter powers and
features you get at higher levels all the way to the end of epic tier. They’re
practically ready-made builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, some of these belong to your paragon path, but Warpriests are in
effect limited to a single choice there, which continues to provide powers from
your chosen domain. Someone who is really into character optimization might pick
a path from another source, but you can just stick to the default Devout
Warpriest path and still be pretty effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heroes of the Fallen Lands, the book that introduced Warpriests, also
introduced the Sun and Storm domains. Heroes of Shadow added the Death
domain for spooky clerics, and Dragon 392 included the Earth domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Neverwinter campaign setting gives us four more domains, doubling the amount
available in the game at the time of its publication. These are all dedicated to
specific FR gods, but they can be used for similar deities from this or other
settings. Though the Neverwinter campaign focuses on the heroic tier, the
domains presented here include powers for the full 30 levels of a character’s
career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to talk about each domain in very general terms, as it would take an
age to go through every power in detail. We’ll cover one domain per post, and
they should each be fairly short.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Elf and Eladrin Racial Variants</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I introduced eladrin in my readings of the Monster Manual, I wrote that I
loved that 4e decided to make a more obvious split between the “fey magician”
and “woodsy archer” archetypes for elves, because previous attempts were usually
a bit muddled and tended to vary too much between settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, Forgotten Realms was one of these previous attempts, since it had sun,
moon, wood, and wild elves. From reading this book, I know now that these elf
types form a spectrum from “more fey” to “more woodsy”, but I didn’t know this
before looking it up. Other settings like Greyhawk and Dragonlance have their
own proprietary classifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of elves in FR as told by this book is similar to the generic version:
they arrived from the Feywild at the dawn of time as a single people and split
into three separate ones over the following centuries: sun elves, moon elves,
and those who would become the drow. After the war that originated the drow,
some of the survivors decided to go back to nature and became wood and wild
elves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes here, Sun and Moon Elves are eladrin racial variants, while
Wood and Wild Elves are elf racial variants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moon-elves&quot;&gt;Moon Elves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moon Elves are the friendlier sort of eladrin. Their cultural wanderlust means
they roamed further than their cousins and took longer to build stationary
empires, but also established good relations with most of the other peoples of
the world. While some of them became more isolationist after the Spellplague,
you can still find moon elves living in many “mortal” kingdoms and
communities. They consider themselves citizens of their nation first, and moon
elves second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Feywild in conjunction with the world, many moon elves have also moved
over there to explore the plane anew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical moon elf PCs are curious, open-minded, and bold, believing that magic
can be found anywhere and good deeds should not be hidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can choose to replace their skill bonuses to Arcana and History with
Insight and Streetwise, and to replace the Eladrin Education feature with
&lt;strong&gt;Elven Weapon Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (longbow and shortbow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For background picks, they can choose between the Diplomacy and Streetwise
skills, and the Chondathan, Damaran, and Untheric languages. All are different
human languages, I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sun-elf&quot;&gt;Sun Elf&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun Elves are assholes. They consider themselves superior to everyone else, even
other elves. To many of them the Spellplague proved that even the non-elven gods
are inferior to the elven ones, since the latter emerged mostly unscathed and
the former very much didn’t. Some of them welcome their renewed connection to
the Feywild, while others view the “core eladrin” newcomers from that plane as
yet another inferior species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun elf characters are typically patient, aloof, and incredibly racist. I think
their lore in previous editions even has them engaging in genocidal plans? Even
if I’m misremembering that bit I would probably still not allow sun elf PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can choose to replace their Arcana/History skill bonuses with
Bluff/Insight, Eladrin Weapon Proficiency with the same Elf Weapon Proficiency
moon elves get, and Eladrin Education with &lt;strong&gt;Wizard Implement
Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt;. This lets them use wands, orbs and staffs with implement powers
from any class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their background picks are the Arcana, Bluff, History and Insight skills, or the
Draconic language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wild-elf&quot;&gt;Wild Elf&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wild Elves are also assholes. They are described as being as xenophobic as sun
elves, and even more isolationist. Their culture is all about living as close to
nature as possible and venerating the primal spirits, which they believe is how
the common ancestors to all elves lived in ancient times. According to them
everyone else is Doing it Wrong, even other elves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wild elf characters are typically respectful of nature and the spirits, nomadic
in honor of the wanderlust Corellon gave their people, and incredibly racist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can replace Elven Accuracy with &lt;strong&gt;Subtle Step&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them shift
their speed once per encounter as a move action. This is very useful considering
elves ignore forest-themed difficult terrain. They can also replace Group
Awareness with &lt;strong&gt;Wild Elf Weapon Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (javelin, spear, longspear).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their associated background skills are Nature, Perception, and Stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wood-elves&quot;&gt;Wood Elves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood Elves are the most similar to core elves. They have friendly relations with
other peoples, and while they also live close to nature they are not nomadic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical wood elves are protective of their forest homes, but also careful and
compassionate. A wood elf might let a trespasser go by if that trespass is not
doing any actual harm, whereas a wild elf would kill them on principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can replace Elven Accuracy with &lt;strong&gt;Sense Threat&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them roll
Perception for initiative and give all allies with a lower initiative than them
a +2 bonus to their own rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let me stop for a moment here. This feels amazingly overpowered. The power
itself is described in “natural language” not much different from the
paraphrased paragraph above, so we don’t know if it’s a power or just a passive
ability. In this case, though, there is no difference - you only ever roll
Initiative once per fight, so an encounter power like this would get used every
fight anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elf rangers, rogues and fey warlocks simply must train Perception and get this
ability. With their ancestry bonuses to Wisdom and Perception, this ensures they
will almost always go first, and give +2 Initiative to the entire rest of the
party too. Clerics care a bit less about going first, but that Initiative bonus
to all allies would still make this power nearly mandatory from a mechanics
perspective. You’re more or less getting an entire warlord class feature for
free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, going back to their other ability: they can replace Group Awareness with
&lt;strong&gt;Reactive Stealth&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them roll Stealth to hide at the same time they
roll Initiative, if they have cover or concealment. Another “mandatory” pick for
stealthy strikers, and better than the equivalent utility power from the Bregan
Spy since you get it at level 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood elf background picks are the Diplomacy, Insight and Nature skills, and the
Chondathan, Damaran, Dwarven, Giant and Goblin languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone among this book’s authors &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; likes wood elves. They’re basically
100% core book elves in outlook and narrative role, but their alternate features
are by far the most powerful in this entry. Making Sense Threat into a Daily
power would bring it to within barely acceptable bounds, though it would still
be quite a bit stronger than the similar ability we saw for Oghma’s Faithful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wild and Sun Elves also have a couple of interesting abilities in Subtle Step
and Wizard Implement Proficiency respectively. The rest of these variant
abilities are more or less equivalent to what they replace. Moon elves are the
only variant here that could become proficient in both longbows and longswords
regardless of class, since they can have the two proficiency traits at the same
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lore-wise, I would again probably not allow players to play Sun or Wild elves as
written, because those two variants are racist assholes. I would still let them
take their replacement features if they so wanted, while being some other type
of elf or eladrin.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Dwarf Racial Variants</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Forgotten Realms has had a list of setting-specific elf and dwarf subraces since
its inception, one which differs from the setup in the 4e Player’s Handbook. The
FR Player’s Guide releases a few years before Neverwinter included a few notes
mapping them to the 4e setup, but those were mostly roleplaying-oriented. Here,
we go deeper and get variant rules for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each variant has a set of benefits that replace standard traits from the
PHB. Players can choose as many of these as they want, so it’s still possible to
choose zero and play a PHB-standard character. Variants also have associated
background skills, which work like those from the themes and might also include
languages. If you pick a language, you’re fluent in it both in speech and
writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you can still only have one background pick - if you choose a skill or
language from these variants, you can’t pick one from your theme or another
source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the rest of this post, we’ll be looking at the variants for dwarves. Next one
is elves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;forgotten-realms-dwarves&quot;&gt;Forgotten Realms Dwarves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DR dwarves were forged by Moradin at the dawn of time, deep underground. They
reached the surface in a moutainous region and built one of its first mortal
empires. Divisions among this empire caused part of the population to migrate
west into the Great Rift, a plains region filled with underground caves. This
was lucky because some ancient cataclysm then wiped out the original
Mountainhome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These plains dwarves split further over the course of history: some journeyed
further into the world, while some stayed on the Rift. Distance changed these
two groupings, though they remain on friendly terms and have a lot of culture in
common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gold-dwarves&quot;&gt;Gold Dwarves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold Dwarves are those who stayed on and under the Great Rift. They proudly
trace their ancestry back to the dawn of time, and as a result are a deeply
traditionalist people that places great value on codes of honor. They believe
each individual has their pre-determined place in society and frown upon those
who would reject their fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the spellplague, gold dwarves had started expanding and migrating out of
the Rift, and this is what saved them as a culture when the plague hit and
destroyed it. A lot of the survivors returned and are attempting to rebuild, and
the disaster also convinced some of them to seek new ways of doing things where
tradition fails them. Other clans have instead doubled down and become actively
xenophobic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical Gold Dwarf PC is expected to place great importance on tradition and
lineage, and to respect their elders. Getting to know someone also means
learning about their family tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can choose to replace Cast-Iron Stomach with &lt;strong&gt;Cast-Iron Mind&lt;/strong&gt;, gaining a
+5 to saves vs. ongoing psychic damage. They can also replace Dwarven Weapon
Proficiency with &lt;strong&gt;Gold Dwarf Weapon Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; to become proficient with the
war pick and the maul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their background skill is Dungeoneering, and their background languages are Deep
Speech and Elven. They deal with drow and other Underdark denizens a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shield-dwarves&quot;&gt;Shield Dwarves&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shield Dwarves migrated out of the Great Rift early, spreading through the world
and encountering more foreign people over their history. As a result they’re
more open to seeking out friends and forging alliances. Though they also value
tradition and honor, they do not consider it dishonorable for an individual to
seek to forge their own destiny, even when it takes them away from home. Delzoun
was founded by Shield Dwarves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impermanence seems to be a big thing for your typical shield dwarf PC. They are
open to alliances and friendships because they know tradition can fail them, but
they are also reserved with those allies because they know allies can fail them
too. When facing problems, they’re all about striking first and taking control
of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shield Dwarves can replace their Dwarven Weapon Proficiency with either &lt;strong&gt;Shield
Dwarf Weapon Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (proficient in handaxes and battle axes) or &lt;strong&gt;Shield
Proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (proficient with the light shield).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a background pick, they can choose between the Dungeoneering, Endurance and
Nature skills, or the Chondathan and Giant languages (FR has a lot more
languages than core 4e).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FR has been around since the early days of D&amp;amp;D, so I don’t know whether generic
D&amp;amp;D dwarves take they traditionalism from FR ones or if it’s the other way
around. Shield dwarves are the ones most similar to those in the core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Weapon Proficienty replacements seem to be about the same (low) power level,
but Shield Proficiency is more generally useful to any non-martial PC who
normally has a hand free. Wand and orb wizards, dagger sorcerers, many monks,
and so on. An extra point of AC and Reflex always helps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cast-Iron Mind is an awesome replacement feature to take when you know you’ll be
facing a lot of psychic enemies, which includes most things with the Aberrant
origin. Spoiler alert: there’s quite a few of these in the Neverwinter campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Bregan D'Aerthe Spy</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-neverwinter-bregan-spy.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I learned about the Bregan D’Aerthe is that WotC’s authors
really like them. This is an organization of mercenary drow led by this dude
named Jarlaxe Baenre, a swashbuckler that’s basically a wittier and more morally
ambiguous Drizz’t. Its members are all some sort of outcast from drow society,
such as members of fallen houses and “houseless males” (in the words of the FR
setting book). They can show up anywhere in the world and are always on the
lookout for an opportunity to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They started out as a ready source of sudden ninja attacks, but by 5e they seem
to appear in every published campaign as one of the factions in play, and even
as a possible patron for PCs. No matter where the story takes place, there’s
always a smirking drow asshole hanging in the background, ready to send your PCs
on cryptic missions and gloating that all went according to plan no matter what
the result of those missions is. Sometimes it’s Jarlaxe himself, sometimes it’s
another character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might have been the book that started the trend, and it did so in a
spectacular fashion: if you pick this theme, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are the smirking drow asshole
with all the secret plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your story is pretty typical. You are a drow who survived the fall of your house
(which as usual for drow involves a massive assassination spree). The Bregan
D’Aerthe took you in and trained you, giving you a new chance to make a life for
yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve worked for them for decades, many of them here in the North’s
surface. You took part in many of the schemes that helped Luskan’s fall along,
and you witnessed the volcanic eruption. After that happened, the bulk of your
Bregan buddies left the area, since the pickings had become slim. Jarlaxe
personally ordered you to stay behind and keep an eye out in case the region
started heating up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that it did, you’re to look into everybody’s business, figure out what all
the factions in the are are up to, and find out how the Bregan D’Aerthe can
profit from their schemes. Jarlaxe is going to swing by some time to hear your
report and give new orders. So yeah, you’re acting as the cryptic smirking drow
“friend” to your fellow PCs while compiling a report for an even bigger cryptic
smirking NPC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be a Bregan D’Aerthe Spy, you must be a drow. You can be any class,
however. Any gender too, despite the “houseless males” bit above. The background
skills for this are Bluff, Dungeoneering, and Stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 1, you gain the &lt;strong&gt;Levitation&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power, which is an innate
magic power few drow manage to master. As a move action, you can fly up to 4
squares up and move 1 square horizontally. You keep hovering up there for a
turn, after which you softly descend to the ground without taking falling
damage. If something else boosts you past an altitude of 4 squares while you’re
levitating, you fall to that altitude without taking damage after resolving the
effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5, you gain &lt;strong&gt;Continuous Levitation&lt;/strong&gt;, a daily power that when used
gives you the ability to sustain Levitation until the end of the encounter. When
you sustain it, you can move an additional 3 squares vertically and 1 square
horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Level 10, when you grant combat advantage, enemies no longer gain the usual
+2 bonus to attack you. They still gain other benefits from having combat
advantage like extra damage or the ability to use specific powers, but their
attacks will be no more accurate than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optional-powers&quot;&gt;Optional Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden Stealth&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 2 encounter power that lets you roll Stealth right
along your Initiative roll if you have any cover or concealment at the start of
combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fluid Steps&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 6 daily power that uses a minor action and lets you
shift 3 squares as a move action for the rest of the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spy Sight&lt;/strong&gt; might familiar to players of the Assassin’s Creed or Arkham
games. It’s a level 10 daily power that uses a minor action and gives you +5 to
Perception and Insight for the rest of the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit I’m predisposed to disliking the Bregan D’Aerthe, precisely because all
those places where they appear seem to go out of the way to picture Jarlaxe as
someone you’re supposed to love even when he betrays your party to make a few
extra gold pieces. What a card, amirite?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I have to praise this theme for its willingness to peel back the curtain
a little and put a PC in the role of the sneaky quest giver. Remove Jarlaxe from
consideration somehow and it gets even better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, this is going to lend a roguish flair to any PC, making them more
mobile and stealthy. It works well for any mobile melee striker, but even
defenders are going to love the protection from flanking or the ability to get
up close and personal with those annoying fliers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple Bregan Spies in a party are possible, but too many mysterious drow in
one place can end up spoiling the mystery. A whole party of them would also end
up sticking out and having a hard time moving around undetected, unless you rule
drow make up a significant part of the general surface population in your
campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
