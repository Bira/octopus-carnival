        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Minor Factions, Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing our exploration of the minor factions at play here, we’ll now look at
those whose presence or attention are centered on the Neverwinter Wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gray-wolf-uthgardt&quot;&gt;Gray Wolf Uthgardt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gray Wolves were just another typical Uthgardt tribe of no particular
distinction until a few hundred years ago, when they took in human refugees from
Gauntlgrym who had been fleeing their captivity by the mind flayers who lived
there. Some of those had been afflicted by lycanthropy. Time and primal magic
made this condition the tribe’s main power and badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of the Neverwinter campaign, this is kinda bad for the PCs
because the Gray Wolves have been captivated by the Shadovar’s honeyed words and
recruited as their agents and shock troops. They expect to be citizens of their
new world-spanning empire, and to be given dominion over all of the North’s
wilderness in exchange for their service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, not all members of the tribe fell for this. Those that didn’t were
cast out and banded together into a group known as the Forsworn, who work to
oppose the works of the Netherese. The Forsworn avoid fighting their own kin,
but the Grey Wolves do not return the favor and try to kill them on sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book recommends using existing werewolf and shifter stat blocks when
building encounters against Grey Wolves, and gives us stats for a Werewolf
Stormcaller (level 6 Artillery) that fulfills a niche not usually covered by
those blocks. It also has stats for Ethraniev Marrowslake, a particularly
bloodthirsty Gray Wolf pack leader (level 7 brute). Both work as you’d expect
for werewolves, with the ability to change shape and both weapon and infectious
bite attacks. The stormcaller has ranged spells that do lightning or thunder
damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pack Outcast PC was among the first of the Gray Wolves to be exiled, since
they didn’t agree to join the Shadovar right at the start. The Forsworn were
exiled after that, as the tribe’s tactics became more and more violent. As the
campaign start, dissidents are being executed instead of exiled. The Outcast has
an easy in with the Forsworn as written, because the group will likely recognize
the PC as being right all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book says the GM is free to make the Forsworn still be evil if they don’t
want the PCs allying with them, though I probably wouldn’t do that. It leans too
much on the “savage barbarian” trope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs who become friends of the Forsworn might be granted an utility power named
&lt;strong&gt;Primal Surge&lt;/strong&gt; as a blessing or reward. It’s an encounter power that triggers
when you use one of your other encounter powers. It lets you roll a d20, and on
a result of 10 or higher the other power is not expended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iliyanbruen-fey&quot;&gt;Iliyanbruen Fey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the group the Iliyanbruen Guardian PC belongs to. As we saw earlier,
they’re descendants of eladrin who fled to the Feywild to survive the
destruction caused on their kingdom by the fall of Xinlenal. When the barriers
between worlds started thinning, they sent expeditions back to the place where
they crossed, and found it occupied by evil fey. They drove those out, and built
an outpost named New Shandarar on both sides of the portal. Then they explored
their old ruins in the middle world and discovered that they had been ravaged by
more than time and disuse - many of their sacred relics and cultural treasures
had been plundered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expeditionary force made it their mission to recover what was stolen. All of
them are pretty angry about this: the main difference is some of them are angry
just at the people responsible for the looting, while others are angry at All
The Mortals and want to genocide/conquer the region on principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether moderate or extremist, the fey of Iliyanbruen are likely to respond with
violence to anyone trespassing on their territory now, unless the Guardian PC is
with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expedition’s commander, Merrisara Winterwhite, is a moderate and the main
reason they haven’t started attacking the region. Several of the community
leaders under her, however, are extremists, and spend all of their time
agitating for more bloodshed. One in particular, a dude named Addemios
Three-Dawn, is a secret worshiper of Asmodeus and in league with the evil fey
the expedition drove away from the portal. He’s the assistant to one of the
city’s priests of Corellon, and his influence is responsible for a lot of the
recent upswing in violent sentiment among the eladrin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The encounter table for New Shandarar is made up of heroic-tier fey creatures:
elves, eladrin, dryads, unicorns, treants and lots of trained fey
beasts. Addemios is statted up as Level 5 Artillery with ranged and area
spells. He’s far from the most powerful individual in this faction, so I’m
guessing that getting them to back off would involve more than defeating
him. That’d still be an important step, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should the extremists win out, the fey could move to “major faction” status
relatively quickly, as they are a significant military force with some pretty
powerful creatures. They certainly &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; they have what it takes to conquer
the region and kill everyone they dislike, but they are probably unaware of the
true extent of the Thayan, Netherese, and Aberrant presences here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cult-of-the-dragon&quot;&gt;Cult of the Dragon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Ashmadai, these cultists have a lot of trouble passing as typical
citizens. The local cell was busy with the usual Cult of the Dragon activities,
which are sucking up to evil dragons and trying to convince them to become
dracoliches. This changed when Valindra (the lich leading the Thayans) took
their leader’s Ring of the Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now they work for her as muscle and are also tasked with finding a way to raise
the dead Lorragauth as a dracolich. Their leader, Adimund Kroskas, is working on
that as slowly as possible while he tries to figure out a way to recover his
ring. He hasn’t made much progress in that either and desperately needs
something to change in his situation. He’ll probably try to make a move when a
significant setback occurs in Valindra’s plan - likely one caused by the PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their encounter table includes humans, genasi, dragonborn, and other “typically
playable” stat blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Minor Factions, Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looks like I accidentally skipped a few posts when making my last update! So
instead of going to chapter 04 now, we’ll finish out chapter 03 and look at the
minor factions over this and the next two posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factions are considered “minor” because they’re either simpler, less
powerful, or less involved in the region than the majors. Most don’t have custom
stat blocks associated with them, and even if they do I’ll only spend time on
them if they’re really interesting. This post covers the “urban” factions, those
whose territories and attentions are in the city proper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dead-rats&quot;&gt;Dead Rats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the wererat gang has a chapter in Neverwinter, led by a one-eyed
lieutenant of Toytere’s name Rrost. Their main racket is smuggling, and as the
campaign starts they managed to set themselves up as the middlemen in the
weapons trade between the Sons of Alagondar and the Thayans. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, the Rats would like to usurp control of the rebels and use
them to become big shots in the city’s underworld, remaking it in Luskan’s
image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their roster features rats, dire rats, and any low-level thug-types you can fit
in, the latter of which can be boosted by a wererat theme pack that gives them
regeneration, an infectious bite, and the ability to assume hybrid form. Rrost
uses the stats for a &lt;strong&gt;Wererat Mugger&lt;/strong&gt; introduced here, a Level 4 Brute with a
poisoned morningstar and a stronger bite than what’s in the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gang would love to kill the Dead Rat Deserter PC, and their ties to the
Thayans are just the thing to get that PC more personally involved in the
campaign’s larger plots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rrost feels like a “Small Bad” who will be a problem at the start of the
campaign for city-focused parties. His plans are big but his faction has no hope
of seeing them realized before the PCs end the Rats’ ambitions for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sons-of-alagondar&quot;&gt;Sons of Alagondar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sons of Alagondar are die-hard Neverwinter nationalists who believe the city
should be independent of foreign control so that it can once again be the Jewel
of the North and a bastion of goodness. They draw most of their membership from
the holdout population of Neverwinter: those people who never left the city and
spent twenty years protecting and rebuilting it before Neverember arrived with
his mercs. As you might imagine, they vehemently oppose him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until very recently their overall leader was a Harper named Cymril, who was
brutally murdered under mysterious circumstances shortly before the start of the
campaign (as seen in the Harper Agent theme). Her death split the Sons into two
sub-factions along generational lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one side you have the Nashers, who take their name from the first Alagondar
lord (the one from the computer games). These young rebels are willing to pay
any cost to see a free Neverwinter and readily resort to violent actions like
rioting, assassination and sabotage. Their leader is a firebrand named Arlon
Bladeshaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other you have the older Graycloaks, who take their name from the old
city militia. They see themselves as focusing on the big picture, with the
city’s welfare as their highest priority. They focus on building support and
alliances with like-minded groups and the city’s population in general. They
also try to infiltrate and influence Neverember’s organization through bribery,
blackmail, and secret deals. Their leader is the human mage Madame Rosene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The Nashers call the Graycloaks “greyhairs”, and the Graycloaks call the Nasher
“gnashers”. Also, there’s a subsection here titled “Fractured but Whole”, which
I can never take seriously after learning about that South Park game.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the Nashers who decided to partner with and accept help from the Dead Rat
gang and the Thayans. Bladeshaper was a bit leery of this at first but he
quickly changed his mind once he saw his faction start racking up bigger
victories against Neverember’s forces. The Rats, as mentioned before, plan to
take over the Sons and make them into an extension of their planned crime
syndicate. The Thayans are using them to distract New Neverwinter from their own
shenanigans and are happy to push their own agents and the Sons to ever greater
heights of violence to that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The encounter table for the Sons is entirely composed of stat blocks belonging
to typically playable ancestries, matching Neverwinter’s demographics. Players
who oppose the Sons will do well to play on their divisions, those who want to
support them should focus on healing that same rift. Cymril’s death nearly broke
them completely, and finding the truth behind it would be a big goal in a
rebellion campaign. As we saw in the Harper Agent’s background, there’s room for
a variety of sinister explanations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impressions-1&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most complex of the minor factions here. It’s possible to make a
campaign entirely focused on the Sons’ struggle, but it would have to start with
earning their trust. They are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; predisposed to allying with PCs and are
likely to be actively hostile to certain themes like the Harper Agent or even
the Neverwinter Noble, whom they might see as just another pretender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;harpers&quot;&gt;Harpers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making Neverwinter into the bastion of good it once was is also part of the
Harper’s mission statement, and they are generally better at sticking to it than
the Sons, but they were broken even more thoroughly by Cymril’s death. She was
their highest ranking member in the area. With her gone, there are about a dozen
members left, and only two of them are full agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These local Harpers are pretty focused on opposing Neverember at the moment and
are completely ignorant of the machinations of the Thayans, Netherese, or
Aboleths in the area. It’s unlikely they will find out on their own, but if they
learn through other means they will instantly shift their focus to opposing
these greater threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs manage to acquire a reputation as local heroes, the Harpers might
approach them and ask them to help the Sons of Alagondar get back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impressions-2&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Harper presence in the city is larger than I was led to believe from reading
the Harper Agent theme. My inclination is to only include them as written if the
party doesn’t have one or more PCs with that theme. If it does, then the PC is
the sole Harper left in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;many-arrows-orcs&quot;&gt;Many-Arrows Orcs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The orcs of the North usually stayed away from the Neverwinter area, because the
city was hostile to them and they had many stories about how the surrounding
woods were haunted. They have recently dismissed these stories as myths and
grown a little bolder and more curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;King Obould XVII of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows recently sent a scout force here
with the mission to find what was going on and report back, but the force’s
power-hungry commander far exceeded her orders and decided to push into the city
and take over the Cloak Tower, claiming the surrounding territory in
Neverwinter’s ruined northern half as her own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I remember correctly, Obould was depicted elsewhere as a reasonable king who
had the capability to turn his people away from their universally hostile ways
and forge more peaceful bonds with his neighbors. Commander Vansi is none of
those things. After taking over the Cloak Tower, she was approached by the
aboleths and gladly accepted a “blessing” of the Spellplague to get
stronger. There’s a stat block for her here. She’s a Level 6 Soldier (Leader)
that fights with a flail and a spiked gauntlet. The Spellplague covered her in
fiery bone spurs, so she loves to grapple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The encounter table for them is obviously all orcs all the time, with the
occasional ogre or half-orc thrown in for variety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impressions-3&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kinda like that there’s a more elaborate reason than just “they’re chaotic
evil” for why this group of orcs are hostile occupiers. Neverember has an open
call for adventurers willing to help drive them out of town, and their
connection to the AbSov might be what clues the PCs in to the presence of that
faction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s even possible that King Obould would &lt;em&gt;reward&lt;/em&gt; the PCs for dealing with the
rogue detachment if you want to play up the newer, less hostile orcish
civilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bregan-daerthe&quot;&gt;Bregan D’Aerthe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These assholes again. They wrung Luskan dry a few decades ago and left the area
when the cataclysm hit. Now a handful of their spies have made their way back to
seek profitable opportunities and report back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice this means you can spice up certain encounters with drow mercs or
informants. They have no elaborate goals for the area yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;impressions-4&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this feels like a minor faction I would only use if there are no Bregan
Spy PCs in the party. If there are, then the PC is their sole representative in
the region. They appear again in a slightly more fun form in the upcoming
locations chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Chapter 4 Intro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here begins Chapter 4, the Gazeteer. This takes up the remaining half of the
book and focuses on describing interesting places in the region and their
associated plot hooks. It also talks about interesting NPCs that might get
involved with the group. These locations and people aren’t fully mapped or
statted out, but are intended to serve as starting points for individual GMs to
customize. As promised in the book’s preface, a lot of plot hooks here are
optional and/or multiple-choice, and GMs are free to change anything in here
however they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chapter covers several major areas, and we might need more than one post for
each of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruined Neverwinter&lt;/strong&gt; is the city proper, struggling to rebuild and deal with
political intrigue, dangerous ruins, and plaguechanged monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helm’s Hold&lt;/strong&gt; is a stout-hearted village with a monastic community that
hides a terrible threat to the region.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neverwinter Wood&lt;/strong&gt;: You wouldn’t believe how many dangerous places and
threatening factions can fit into this one forest!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gauntlgrym&lt;/strong&gt;: the hidden dwarven city no longer has any dwarves in it, but
it has pretty much everything else including that slumbering primordial.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evernight&lt;/strong&gt; is Neverwinter’s reflection on the Shadowfell and the main
battleground in the war between Thayans and Netherese.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thay Through the Veil&lt;/strong&gt;: PCs who follow the plot threads from Evernight all
the way to their end might find themselves needing to make some visits to Nazi
Necromancer Central.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Netherese Encounters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The encounter table for the Netherese is packed with shadow-themed
opponents. There are a few humans here and there, but also a lot of shadar-kai,
and Dark Ones, and a few new options to turn any of these into Shades. Since
they’re a magic-heavy faction the table also includes a few constructs and bound
incorporeal undead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shades&quot;&gt;Shades&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shades are creatures that absorbed so much of the Shadowfell’s ambient magic
that they mutated. They can also be born from otherwise “mundane” creatures who
absorbed that energy. As you might expect a lot of the Shadovar fit this
description.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to turn a monster stat block into a Shade. The Forgotten
Realms’ campaign setting has a monster template that turns a regular monster
into an elite shade. And this book presents a theme that adds appropriate powers
to an existing creature without upgrading its “quality”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme changes the base creature’s origin to Shadow, adds Darkvision and
Vulnerable 5 radiant and also these three abilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt; 5, which shuts down for a turn when the creature takes
radiant damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coalescing Darkness&lt;/strong&gt;, a trait that gives the shade total concealment for a
turn whenever it moves 3 or more squares by any means.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Stride&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter power that takes a move action and lets the
shade teleport up to &lt;em&gt;20&lt;/em&gt; squares, but requires that the destination space be
in dim light or darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thaalud-constructor&quot;&gt;Thaalud Constructor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most fearsome security measures in Netherese tombs and ruins are the
constructs known as Thaalud Tomb Trappers. The Constructor is a modern design
based on those, weaker but easier to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all the lore we get for this monsters. Since I don’t know anything about
tomb trappers I’m forced to speculate based on their stats. I’m thinking they’re
huge eyeless humanoid statues, and quite a bit smarter than your typical
mindless construct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A constructor is a Huge Natural Animate with the Blind and Construct keywords,
and a Level 5 Elite Brute with 154 HP. It’s immune to poison, blindness, and
gaze attacks, and has Resist 5 to cold, fire, and lightning. It perceives the
world with Blindsight 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It attacks with &lt;strong&gt;Mauling Fists&lt;/strong&gt; that damage and grab on a hit (escape DC 15),
and can make &lt;strong&gt;double attacks&lt;/strong&gt; with them. If the constructor has a Large or
smaller creature grabbed, it can throw it at someone else with &lt;strong&gt;Hurl Foe&lt;/strong&gt;, a
ranged attack that damages both the target and the “ammunition”. On a hit, the
target is pushed 1 square and knocked prone, and the hurled PC falls prone on
the target’s former space. On a miss both take half damage and the thrown
character falls prone adjacent to the target. I gotta say “grab and yeet” sounds
like a very fun combat style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a constructor is destroyed it &lt;strong&gt;Collapses into rubble&lt;/strong&gt;, attacking a Close
Burst 1 around itself and turning that area into a zone of difficult terrain
that lasts until the end of the encounter. Note that the creature is Huge, so
this zone is 4 squares on a side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clariburnus-tanthul-prince-of-shade&quot;&gt;Clariburnus Tanthul, Prince of Shade&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shadovar are ruled by the Twelve Princes of Shade, Netherese mages who were
witnesses to the fall of their empire and managed to stay alive(-ish) to the
present day. Clariburnus Tanthul is one of these Twelve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to all expectations, he’s not undead! Tanthul is an ancient living
shade, and is described as retaining more of his original humanity than the
other Princes. Still, he’s a merciless manipulator with no concept of honor,
breaking his promises as casually as he breathes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clariburnus Tanthul is a Medium Shadow Humanoid and a Level 10 Elite Skirmisher
with 158 HP. He has a Speed of 7 and both Blindsight 10 and Darkvision. His
traits resemble those of the Shade theme above but they’re custom and more
powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His &lt;strong&gt;Benighted Presence&lt;/strong&gt; acts as an aura (5) that turns bright light dim, and
his &lt;strong&gt;Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt; heals 15 HP per turn, though it’s still shut down for a
turn by radiant damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wields a scimitar named &lt;strong&gt;Gloom Crescent&lt;/strong&gt;, which can make basic attacks and
is also used for the &lt;strong&gt;Severing Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; technique. This lets him make 2 basic
attacks (3 if bloodied), teleporting 5 squares before each one. If he hits the
same target twice that target also takes 5 ongoing force damage (save
ends). This worsens to 10 ongoing force damage and blindness after the first
failed save (save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter he can use a ranged spell named &lt;strong&gt;By Night Consumed&lt;/strong&gt;, which
deals necrotic damage and &lt;em&gt;removes the target from play&lt;/em&gt; (save ends). A miss
deals half damage and dazes (save ends). Nasty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Stride&lt;/strong&gt; lets him teleport 5 squares regardless of light
conditions, which increases to 10 if the destination is in darkness. It’s also a
(Recharge 4+) ability instead of an encounter power, so he can use it more than
once in a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has less custom stat blocks than some of the other factions, so you’ll be
mostly relying on the encounter table and shade versions of natural
critters. Still, the custom stat blocks we do get are fun, and it looks like
Clariburnus is a genuine Forgotten Realms big shot who would probably get an
epic-level stat block in a more traditional FR setting book. I love it that he’s
“within reach” of a heroic-tier party here. His stats make for a very
interesting fight, though you should also give him an honor guard.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the Neverwinter Campaign Setting: Netherese</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned several times in this Let’s Read already, Netheril was a human
empire who ruled over most of the world around three thousand years before our
narrative present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their understanding of magic reached levels never seen before or since, but they
fell literally overnight when one of their top archmages tried to cast a spell
that was supposed to make him into a god but instead irreversibly fucked up
Toril’s magic. This caused the vast majority of the flying islands where these
archmages lived to plummet to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such island managed to avoid this fate when its inhabitants plane-shifted it
into the Shadowfell (known as the Plane of Shadow back then). They stayed there
until the end of Second Edition, when they started coming back into the world,
mutated by their millenia in darkness and with a desire to rebuild their former
empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shadow-people are known as Shadovar, but they also consider themselves to
be Netherese and the book uses the two terms interchangeably. There’s a group of
them hiding in the Neverwinter Wood, led by a mage named Clariburnus Tanthul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shadovar have a single major goal in this region: to repair the fallen
island of Xinlenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xinlenal was the first Netherese flying island ever built, the crowning
achievement of the ancient archmage Iolaum, who discovered the technique to
making them. Making it fly again would raise the flag of Netherese dominance
over the whole region, and it would become their greatest center of power in the
entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to fixing Xinlenal is to repair its &lt;em&gt;mythallar&lt;/em&gt;, a magical engine that
looks like a giant crystal sphere and shines like a contained sun. It shattered
when the city fell, and Shadovar artificers are hard at work repairing it as the
campaign starts. The process requires immense quantities of Residuum, and the
easiest way to produce Residuum is to destroy magic items. The older and more
powerful, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means Shadovar agents are scouring the entire region looking for ancient
ruins and the magical relics they contain. The ruined cities of Illefarn, the
crumbling outposts of Delzoun, even the burial mounds of Uthgardt heroes: all of
these are fair game, and anyone who would object to their plundering is an
enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even these ancient ruins might yield enough residuum for their purposes,
though. They’ve started looking at less-old places too. As the campaign starts
that’s still mostly consists of clashing with and looting the bodies of Thayan
and Ashmadai goons, but they could soon move up to plundering Neverwinter
itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Caliburnus’ secondary goals include discovering the fate of Iolaum. Sure,
the wizard lived thousands of years ago and was on Xinlenal when it fell, but
surely one of the bestest mages from the bestest magical empire ever wouldn’t
let little details like that kill him, would it? Imagine what he could do for
the Shadovar cause if he’s brought on-board!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other secondary goal is to pursue their war with Thay. There’s only room for
&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; world-spanning fascist mage empire in this planet, after all. The Shadovar
regularly attack the Thayan base in the Dread Ring, and they’ve also managed to
park one of their flying fortresses above the Thayan city of Surcross, which
they bombard regularly. In case you don’t remember, that’s one of the possible
locations where Valindra might have hidden her soul vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, further down the list, there’s the handling of the Gray Wolf
Uthgardt tribe. The Shadovar recruited them into their service with appeals to
their “ancient Netherese heritage” and gave them the mission to infiltrate and
eventually conquer Helm’s Hold. So far the werewolves have managed to place
several agents in the town, who are busy sowing unrest and generally making it
ready for a takeover. Their progress is slow but in Caliburnus’ view the tribe’s
main purpose is to act as a red herring when people start trying to investigate
Netherese activities. In the meantime, Gray Wolf warriors also get used as
muscle when the need for it arises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;player-tie-ins&quot;&gt;Player Tie-Ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherese seems to be the major faction with the most explicit tie-ins to PC
backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scion of Shadow, of course, starts the game in direct conflict with
them. They have enough information to begin opposing the faction right away, and
especially bold Scions might think to pretend to be loyal in order to infiltrate
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their rampant plundering of ancient ruins also places them in direct opposition
to the Iliyanbruen Guardian, Heir of Delzoun, and the Uthgardt Barbarian. The
book says they are definitely guilty of stealing those eladrin relics, but it’s
less definitive about their role in plundering the Uthgardt barrow - that could
have been the Thayans depending on what the GM desires. Even so, their control
of the Gray Wolves will still make them cross paths with both the Barbarian and
the Pack Outcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherese don’t care about &lt;strong&gt;New Neverwinter&lt;/strong&gt; at all, though that will
change a bit when they start targeting the city for its magic items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are completely ignorant of the &lt;strong&gt;Abolethic Sovereignity&lt;/strong&gt;. Some of their
officials suspect there’s something funky going on beneath Neverwinter and have
sent agents to investigate, but they’re only going to bother Caliburnus about
this when those agents return with answers. This makes the fact that they’re
trying to conquer Helm’s Hold particularly funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They see the &lt;strong&gt;Ashmadai&lt;/strong&gt; as nothing more than minions of the Thayans and have
no idea the cult has plans of its own. The &lt;strong&gt;Thayans&lt;/strong&gt; of course are their
greatest enemies in the region and the Shadovar devote as many resources to
fighting them as they do to restoring Xinlenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have some important links to minor factions, as mentioned above. Their
hold over the Gray Wolves means they will have to deal with the other &lt;strong&gt;Uthgardt
Tribes&lt;/strong&gt; eventually, and the &lt;strong&gt;fey of Iliyanbruen&lt;/strong&gt; are the primary targets of
their relic raids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Netherese are a bit less cognizant of the other factions than I
expected, their plans are appropriately ambitious and they have a real shot at
success barring PC intervention. They also have a bunch of strong ties to
several PC themes, so they’re very likely to feature in your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Play Hell's Rebels: Devils and other Fiends</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My recent adaptation efforts for that Hell’s Rebels campaign had me going on a
spelunking expedition about fiend stats in D&amp;amp;D. Here’s what I found out, and
what I intend to do about it on this GURPS adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes here, “fiend” refers to all of the monsters that originate from
the “evil planes” of the D&amp;amp;D universe: demons, devils, daemons, and
others. “Fiend” was the only general term left, so we’re using it in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fiends-in-dd&quot;&gt;Fiends in D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D&amp;amp;D’s fiend situation is one of the most egregious examples of its tendency
towards overly-complicated taxonomies&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Every synonym becomes the name of a
distinct type of monster with stats that differ from those of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real purpose of the divide here seems to be mechanical: in most editions
each type has a different lengthy list of weaknesses and resistances that seems
calculated to confuse players. Things that are good against devils are bad
against demons and vice-versa - if the PCs guess wrong, they’re in trouble. The
specifics here change from edition to edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lore-wise, early editions made a big deal out of the fact that devils were
Lawful Evil and demons Chaotic Evil. Later ones tried to elaborate on it and
find more ways to explain that the two alignments were different at a
fundamental cosmic level. Pathfinder really doubles down on that, trying to find
additional themes for every fiend type it presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathfinder 1e, which is what we’re interested in, has this configuration for the
mechanical bits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Demons are immune to lightning; Devils take normal damage from it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devils are immune to fire; Most demons are merely resistant to it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re equally resistant to acid and cold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re both immune to poison.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re resistant to weapon attacks unless the weapon is Good-aligned &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;
made from a special material. For demons, that’s cold iron; for devils,
silver. Powerful specimens have resistance that can only be bypassed by
weapons fulfilling both the alignment and material requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about as complex to describe as it was in previous editions, but it’s
actually much easier to completely bypass due to the combinatorial explosion in
spells and magical effects available to players compared to AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first couple of levels you can forget about the materials requirement
entirely, because you’ll have access to Align Weapon or the Holy enchantment. By
the time you’re fighting those stronger fiends, you’ll probably have a +3 weapon
in hand, which also bypasses both material requirements. And as for elemental
damage types, this is the edition that introduces sonic damage, which damages
both demons and devils normally. It also makes it quite easy for a character to
swap all of their spells’ damage to sonic&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fiends-in-dungeon-fantasy&quot;&gt;Fiends In Dungeon Fantasy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dungeon Fantasy is a lot simpler. Demon is one of the big monster categories in
the game, and all demons come from the area colloquially known as Hell. The
specifics are left as an exercise to the GM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belonging to the Demon category makes them immune to magic that affects the
minds of natural creatures and susceptible to magic that affects spirits in
general or demons in particular. They don’t count as “alive” for spells that
strictly require living targets but always count as “evil” for spells and
abilities that affect evil creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notably, they do not have any universal resistances to elemental damage or
mundane weapons. Each demon “species”, other than the very weakest ones, does
have additional defenses. Most take damage as normal but can only &lt;em&gt;die&lt;/em&gt; if a
specific condition is met. They also often lack some or all of the weak points
of natural creatures, such as blood and vital organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaming Ballistic’s &lt;em&gt;Nordlond Bestiary&lt;/em&gt; does include some demons that are direct
adaptations of D&amp;amp;D fiends, but only the most powerful of them (the Balor and Pit
Fiend equivalents) have resistances that resemble Pathfinder’s to any degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-will-i-do-in-hells-rebels&quot;&gt;What Will I Do in Hell’s Rebels?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was starting this project way back in 2017, I’d probably be gearing up to
convert every devil that appeared in Hell’s Rebels to GURPS. But since this is
2023, I don’t have to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of first- and third-party Dungeon Fantasy books now, and between
them I have more than enough stat blocks available that I can just pick whatever
looks closer to the original monster and use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does mean that I’m going to end up ignoring a lot of the default D&amp;amp;D
cosmology and lore when picking my monsters. “Demon” and “devil” are once again
synonyms - there is no fundamental cosmic difference between them. They all come
from the same place. Any differences, if they ever become relevant, are
political rather than taxonomical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also ignoring the difference between Lawful Evil and Chaotic Evil because
1) there is no alignment in GURPS DF and 2) it’s a bit nonsensical anyway. In
fact, &lt;em&gt;Pathfinder itself&lt;/em&gt; is going to get rid of alignment in its upcoming
revised second edition, which was motivated by an attempt to rid itself of all
remaining ties to the OGL after this January’s brouhaha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game’s existing rules should suffice to determine whether something counts
as “holy”/”good” or “unholy”/”evil” for game purposes. This is a similar
approach to what I hear PF 2.5 is going to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Another famous one is incorporeal undead. Is that thing a wraith, a
specter, a shade, or a ghost? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That’s assuming they want to fight fair in the first place instead of
casting one of this edition’s many instant fight-enders. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Thayan Encounters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The encounter table includes a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of undead, and some spellcasters like the
Human Transmuter from the MV to act as living Red Wizards. Valindra’s special
projects also get some consideration here, and then we move on to the lich
herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-neverwinter-nine&quot;&gt;The Neverwinter Nine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the renowned bodyguards of Lord Nasher Alagondar a century ago. After
their deaths, they were buried in the castle crypts in honor of their exemplary
service. Should Valindra manage to animate them as undead, they’d have the stats
of a Deathlock Wight from the MV or the stats for a Unhallowed Wight presented
in this book (level 7 soldier, 80 hp, claws that immobilize and drain healing
surges, auto-damage as an opportunity action on enemies who pass a saving
throw). You can also use similar undead monstrosities if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the Neverwinter Nine get two extra powers in addition to whatever
their base stat block gives them. &lt;strong&gt;One in Nine&lt;/strong&gt; is an encounter power that
lets the creature teleport and swap places with another of the Nine that’s
within 20 squares. And &lt;strong&gt;Change Shape&lt;/strong&gt; lets them take the form of a Medium
humanoid they killed during the last encounter, lasting until they use the power
again or cancel the transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last one means the Nine can serve story roles as infiltrators. One might
even manage to replace Lord Neverember or another big shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ash-zombie&quot;&gt;Ash Zombie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are zombies produced by the particular conditions of the eruption disaster
area. They leave a trail of ash in their wake and are drawn to “fresh” life, the
younger the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any corporeal undead can be converted into the “Ash” equivalent with the
addition of the &lt;strong&gt;Puff of Ash&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power. When the creature is first
bloodied, this triggers and enemy Fortitude in a Close Burst 2. A hit makes the
target grant combat advantage and prevents them from spending healing surges
(save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lorragauth&quot;&gt;Lorragauth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorragauth was a particularly despicable elder black dragon who died in the
process of destroying his own domain, which he started doing because he realized
he was dying. If he couldn’t have it, then no one else could!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Valindra succeeds at reanimating him, he’s going to use the stats for a
dracolich from the Monster Vault or the Forgotten Realms Campaign
Setting. Either is going to make him a Level 12 Solo Controller and one the most
powerful monsters in the entire campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;valinda-shadowmantle&quot;&gt;Valinda Shadowmantle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valindra is much like a typical lich in that she’s extremely arrogant,
egotistical and ambitious. She serves Tam because it suits her for now and is a
very competent lieutenant, but her arrogance makes her prone to underestimating
her opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has complete confidence that her soul vessel is securely hidden and will
never be found by any of her enemies, so she doesn’t fear destruction and fights
with seemingly suicidal zeal to protect her plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How right she is depends on how the GM wishes to play her. If they want the PCs
to defeat her after a single climatic battle, the vessel is right there in her
inner sanctum at the Dread Ring. If they want to make her a recurring threat,
it’s hidden in the far away Thayan city of Scorrus (which is covered later in
the book).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Velindra’s stats shows us she was an eladrin in life, probably a sun elf. She’s
a Level 9 Elite Controller with 188 HP. She has a ground speed of 6, a flight
speed of 4, and darkvision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her basic melee attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Vampiric Touch&lt;/strong&gt; that deals necrotic damage and
heals Valindra for the same amount. This will be quite annoying to PCs and
greatly increase her staying power. Her basic ranged attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Phantom
Claw&lt;/strong&gt; that targets one or two creatures, deals necrotic and psychic damage, and
immobilizes (save ends). Each failed saving throw lets her slide the target 2
squares. On a miss, the target is still slowed (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has a &lt;strong&gt;Profane Fire&lt;/strong&gt; attack that’s pretty much a fireball that does
necrotic and fire damage, and recharges when she’s bloodied. And she retains the
&lt;strong&gt;Fey Step&lt;/strong&gt; she had in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As minor actions, she can use one of two encounter powers. &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Cloak&lt;/strong&gt;
gives her insubstantial and phasing but prevents her from taking standard
actions until she ends the whole effect as a free action. And &lt;strong&gt;Reanimate&lt;/strong&gt; lets
her bring a dead non-minion ally back into the fight as an undead creature. The
creature comes back with HP equal half its bloodied value and gains Resist
Necrotic 10 and Vulnerable Radiant 5. The target must have been a living
creature before dying - if it was undead already, this doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of these is the Thayan’s most fearsome weapon depends on how you want to
play them. If they’re an insidious and secretive threat in your campaign, then
you’ll get a lot of mileage out of the Neverwinter Nine and their ability to
replace key people in other organizations. If they’re a more direct and forceful
enemy, facing Lorragauth is a distinct possibility in the PCs’ futures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, Valindra herself is a key player and should likely be there for the
final fight. PCs might end up facing her a few times before then, depending on
how secure you want her soul vessel to be. Finding it could be a neat series of
adventures in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: The Red Wizards of Thay</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When Szass Tam the epic lich took over the nation of Thay, he tasked the Red
Wizards with building a series of fortresses over powerful sources of
necromantic magic all through the Realms. These fortresses would siphon and
channel magic energy to him, helping him power a major ritual that would turn
him into a god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dread Ring was the fortress built into the Neverwinter Wood. The Thayans’
plan here was to wake up the slumbering primordial Maegera, which would level
Neverwinter completely and kill every one of its inhabitants. The power derived
from these deaths would then be sent to Tam. The wizards were foiled at the last
minute, yet Maegera still woke up a little and caused the eruption which
&lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; destroyed Neverwinter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Thayans are back. There are little more than frightened whispers about
their presence in the region, and no one knows they were responsible for
destroying the city thirty years ago, but if left unchecked there’s a good
chance they’ll finish the job, one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-and-strategies&quot;&gt;Goals and Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thayan presence in the region is focused on the ruins of the Dread Ring,
where living wizards and undead laborers work tirelessly to rebuild the walls of
the fortress and fix its damaged magic circuits. They’re led by a lich named
Valindra Shadowmantle, one of Tam’s lieutenants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her mission is to either restore the Ring to its old purpose, or to find a new
one for it. The first goal is likely impossible - the godhood ritual does not
allow for second chances and all of the other fortresses have proved
unusable. Valindra has a pretty good idea of how she will reach the second goal,
though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has discovered why this site was a suitable location for the fortress in the
first place! Deep beneath its location is the incredibly ancient tomb of a great
black dragon named Lorragauth. Inside rests the beast’s intact skeleton, which
emits a great deal of necrotic energy. Valindra thinks it’s possible to animate
the skeleton as a dracolich under her control, and she’s “conquered” a local
cell of the Cult of the Dragon to aid her in this endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cult of the Dragon are an old Forgotten Realms standby: yet another bunch of
evil maniacs intent on ruling the world, but also the only group in the setting
who knows how to make dracoliches. Their ritual requires a &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; dragon, but
Valindra is confident her pet cult can change it to work on ancient bones. And
if they can’t, she’ll find someone to resurrect the dragon first and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; turn
it into a dracolich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cult, of course, is not happy about this. Its leader, Adimond Kroskas, is
being forced to work for Valindra because she stole his Ring of the Dragon,
which acts as his symbol of authority and is a powerful magical item in its own
right. He can’t call on his own superiors for help because they’ll destroy him
for losing the ring. He’s currently maintaining the loyalty of his underlings
because he’s promised to get the ring back. While he figures out a way to do it,
he and his cult are working to find a way to raise Lorragauth… as slowly as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Valindra is still trying to find a way to properly “refuel”
the Dread Ring. One of her theories is that it might be possible to drain power
directly from Maegera to feed into the fortress. That would require finding a
new path to Gauntlgrym (the one they used in the novel has collapsed). If the
Netherese manage to fix Xinlenal, though, she might divert her efforts to
capturing it in order to use its mythalar engine as that power source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third goal they’re working towards is building up an undead army. They’ve
begun a mass grave-robbing operation in Neverwinter’s cemetery to produce
low-level undead to act as laborers and guards, and are sending the surplus back
to Thay to aid in their war with Netheril as well. They’re also established an
outpost in the crypts beneath Castle Never, where they are attempting to raise
an old group of heroes (the Neverwinter Nine) as powerful revenants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;player-tie-ins&quot;&gt;Player Tie-Ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Renegade Red Wizard is our theme that’s on a collision course with the
Thayans, but others might also find themselves involved. People have started to
notice the grave-robbing and might contact someone like Oghma’s Faithful or the
Neverwinter Noble to help them solve this mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uthgardt Barbarian would also be very interested in this as the Thayans are
a very likely suspect in the sacking of their holy burial mound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Oghma’s Faithful might be approached my mysterious but generous
patrons who wish to hire them to perform some important magical research…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, we also get full stats for the stolen &lt;strong&gt;Ring of Dragons&lt;/strong&gt;, which might make
a cool magic item for the PCs if they manage to acquire it. It’s a Level 7 Rare
item. Wearing it gives you the ability to speak, read, and write Draconic, and
to communicate telepathically with dragons in your line of sight. It also has
two active daily powers. One of them makes your location known to every evil
dragon within a day’s travel, which cultists use as a way to summon allies but
is likely to backfire for PCs. The other projects sustainable illusion of a
dragon of up to Gargantuan size within 40 squares of you. It can make sounds and
move, and generally does a convincing job of looking like you summoned an elder
dragon bodyguard. However it will pop like a soap bubble if it touches anything
or is hit by an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Neverwinter has just started to look into Thayan activities in the region,
and the Thayans have begun providing material support to the Sons of Alagondar
to thrown them off the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valindra knows the Abolethic Sovereignity has an operation in the region, but
that’s all she knows, and it makes her very angry. She’s begun sending people to
investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thayans and Netherese are at war all over the Realms, and this area is no
exception. A lot of that undead manpower Valindra has been building up is being
used in an ongoing battle against the local Netherese operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also has some conflicts with the Many-Arrows Orcs, who occasionally encroach
upon the Dread Ring and must be driven off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, you’ll notice that I did not mention the Ashmadai even once despite
Valindra living in their head rent-free over in the Ashmadai entry. That’s how
much she thinks of them. They are nothing more than disposable muscle to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ll see from the encounter table in the next post, the Thayans are clearly
set up to be one of the campaign’s final bosses - possibly &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; final boss if
they manage to animate Lorragauth. Valindra is the most powerful faction boss so
far even without the dragon, and their backstory does have a nice thematic link
to the event that started this whole situation in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Ashmadai Encounters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The enemy table for the Ashmadai includes Heroic-tier devils and cambions from
several books, and also several humanoid opponents that could be reskinned as
cultists. We also get a few new stat blocks for cultists and devils, and for the
cult’s leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seared-devil&quot;&gt;Seared Devil&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking like a stinky burned corpse, this devil hurls itself at its victims,
driven by envy of their uncooked state. It’s a Level 3 Soldier with 50 HP, speed
5, and Resist 10 Fire. Its basic attack is an &lt;strong&gt;Ashen Slam&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and
marks for a turn on a hit. Enemies that ignore the mark are hit by the &lt;strong&gt;Choking
Ashes&lt;/strong&gt; power, taking 5 fire damage and getting slowed for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;branded-zealot&quot;&gt;Branded Zealot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who get initiated into the cult are branded with the symbol of
Asmodeus. Most of them use this stat block. The typical zealot has a frightful
temper and is easily goaded into fights. They’re Level 4 Brutes with 66 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zealots attack in melee with a &lt;strong&gt;Branding Iron&lt;/strong&gt; that deals fire damage, and at
range with a Range 3 &lt;strong&gt;Hellfire Chain&lt;/strong&gt; spell that deals fire damage, pulls 2
squares, and slows for a turn on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their special move is named &lt;strong&gt;Bow to Your Master&lt;/strong&gt;, and it lets them do a
Hellfire chain attack followed by a Branding Iron attack if the target is
adjacent to them. It recharges when neither attack hits. If both of them do, the
target falls prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hellfire-warlock&quot;&gt;Hellfire Warlock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more discreet cultist, who got infernal warlock powers from deals with
Asmodeus. They’re better at concealing their brands and like to infiltrate enemy
centers to spy and sabotage them. They’re Level 4 Artillery with 48 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warlock’s &lt;strong&gt;Hellfire Affinity&lt;/strong&gt; gives them +2 to defenses against enemies
who are taking ongoing fire damage. Both of their basic attacks (a &lt;strong&gt;dagger&lt;/strong&gt;
for melee and a &lt;strong&gt;Hellfire&lt;/strong&gt; bolt for ranged combat) damage and inflict ongoing
fire damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter they can release a &lt;strong&gt;Concussive Inferno&lt;/strong&gt; in a Close
Burst 2, targeting enemies. On a hit, this deals fire and force damage, pushes
the targets 2 squares, and knocks them prone. On a miss it still deals half
damage and pushes 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a creature within 10 squares of the warlock is taking fire damage, they can
&lt;strong&gt;Ride the Fire&lt;/strong&gt; as a move action (recharge 5+) and teleport to swap places
with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fimbrul-devil&quot;&gt;Fimbrul Devil&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks just like a seared devil, but is cold. These things hail from Nessus or
Cania, and it is said that someone who survives a fight with them suffers from
persistent chills for years afterwards. They’re Level 5 Controllers with 66 HP,
Speed 6 with Ice Walk, and Resist 10 to both fire and cold damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Icy Claws&lt;/strong&gt; deal cold damage; their &lt;strong&gt;Icy Exhalation&lt;/strong&gt; hits a Close
Blast 3, deals cold damage, and slows for a turn. Targets that were already
slowed are instead immobilized. Once per encounter they can encase a creature in
a &lt;strong&gt;Frozen Prison&lt;/strong&gt; as a ranged attack, which deals cold damage and restrains
(save ends). On a miss, the target takes half damage and is immobilized (save
ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mordai-vell&quot;&gt;Mordai Vell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pleasant face of the cult, Mordai Vell is a tiefling aristocrat descended
from one of Neverwinter’s minor noble clans that was largely unaffected by the
cataclysm. This doesn’t give him a claim to the throne, but does leave him with
a lot of inherited wealth. His money and title make him an influent character in
the city’s politics, and his public reputation is generally good because he’s
almost as charismatic as he thinks he is. He sees Asmodeus not as his master,
but as a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the deals and schemes detailed above, Vell is also dealing with a
duergar named Nimor Ironvoice who claims to have access to a source of
hellthorn, a special metallic alloy that is very easy to enchant with infernal
magic. He has people following Ironvoice around for a while now, but the duergar
is careful enough to avoid revealing his sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When faced in combat, Vell is a Level 6 Lurker with 60 HP and Resist 10
Fire. His basic melee attack is with a &lt;strong&gt;rod&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and pushes 2
squares, but his special powers are the most interesting part about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiery Corona&lt;/strong&gt; attacks a Close Burst 2, dealing fire and force damage and
inflicting ongoing fire damage. &lt;strong&gt;Shrouded in Fire&lt;/strong&gt; deals 5 automatic fire
damage to everyone adjacent to Mordai and lets him become invisible and teleport
5 squares. He remains invisible until he attacks or until the end of his next
turn. Using one of these powers recharges the other, so he’s going to alternate
them if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;favria&quot;&gt;Favria&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favria had been enslaved by a far-away band of Asmodeus-worshiping duergar since
her birth. She escaped their service, but kept their faith. She made her way to
Neverwinter to search for Gauntlgrym, joining up with the local cult and rising
to a leadership position mostly through force and intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Vell is the pleasant lie, Favria is the harsh reality of Asmodeus
worship. Instead of lies and intrigue, she prefers to deal with problems by the
direct application of violence. Still, she sees value in his way of doing
things, and cooperates by keeping herself and her underlings mostly out of
Neverwinter proper. They have a hideout in the ruins of the village of
Thundertree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Vell, Favria knows exactly what the unholy relic of Asmodeus held by the
Thayans is capable of, which is why she is so intent on recovering it. She’s
also still looking for Gauntlgrym. She is unaware that it’s currently occupied
by Asmodeus-worshiping duergar, and her reaction to that discovery is
unpredictable. Will she readily cooperate with her fellows in faith, or will she
try to kill them to avenge her suffering at the hands of a similar group?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favria is a Level 5 Skirmisher with 68 HP. She has Resist 5 to fire and poison,
and fights using a pair of custom &lt;strong&gt;bladed hand crossbows&lt;/strong&gt; that can be used in
melee or at range. The melee attack deals extra damage if the target grants
combat advantage, and the ranged attack fires &lt;strong&gt;poisoned bolts&lt;/strong&gt; that damage and
inflict ongoing poison damage (save ends). &lt;strong&gt;Dual Assault&lt;/strong&gt; lets her make one of
each attack once per encounter, recharging if neither hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did say I wasn’t inclined to make the Ashmadai a major thread but if I still
wanted them to have a bit of staying power I’d probably tone down Mordai Vell’s
personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As written, his demeanor is so Trump-like any players here in 2023 will
immediately figure out he’s a bad guy and do their best to gank him early. That
might bring some attention from the other factions, but would remove the cult
itself as an effective threat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Ashmadai</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since before the cataclysm that destroyed the city, the Neverwinter region was
being infiltrated by the Ashmadai, a particularly powerful cult of
Asmodeus. There’s a lot of backstory here, which seems to tie into to a Drizz’t
novel. Let’s try to go over it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back before the Cataclysm, the Ashmadai mostly worked as flunkies for the
Thayans, because the Thayan leader Szass Tam had in his possession a scepter
believed to be an unholy relic of Asmodeus. They were the wizards’ muscle when
they tried to destroy Neverwinter to build the Dread Ring, their super
necromantic fortress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that plan fell through in a Drizz’t novel, the Thayans fled the area and
left the Ashmadai to their own devices until recently, when this Thayan lich
named Valindra came back and announced she was the unholy scepter’s new owner,
demanding the cultists’ loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cult now finds itself split into two sub-factions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditionalists are older and less educated, and serve out of genuine faith
in their evil god. They’re okay with going back to being Thayan flunkies because
of the scepter, which they value highly. They’re led by a dwarf named Favria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “new guard” is less religious and a lot more pragmatic. They want to retain
their independence and rule the region themselves. They’re led by a tiefling
named Mordai Vell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those two sub-factions are actually quite friendly with each other. Their
leaders meet regularly, even though their lower-ranking members have no
contact. Favria will happily leave the Thayans’ service if Vell can steal the
scepter from them. Vell also wants to capture Valindra’s soul vessel, which will
let him extract some payback from the lich for all the abuse she has been
heaping upon them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they’ve attained their independence, the Ashmadai plan to move on to
dominating the region. What exactly this means is up to the GM, and will inform
their strategies. Do they want to rule the region openly as its new imperial
masters? Do they want to establish themselves as a “legitimate” religion and
rule that way? Do they want to be a power behind the throne? Do they want to
harness Maegera’s power to do so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the Ashmadai are by far the weakest of the major factions from this
book, so a lot of their more immediate goals revolve around fixing that and
avoiding the notice of the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pragmatist faction operates mostly from the shadows. Mordai Vell established
a complex system of cells or “pods”, where the highest-ranking leaders report to
him but don’t know each other, and this structure repeats down each leader’s
hierarchy all the way down to the dumb muscle on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditionalist faction is more direct and violent, though they mostly keep
out of town unless called upon. In areas already under their control, they paint
their symbol on buildings and alleys as a way to remind the local populace who’s
boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the aboleths, the Ashmadai are fond of kidnapping people. Their victims
become sacrifices in a peculiar arrangement they have with their diabolic
patron. For each devil they summon into the world, they must also bind a mortal
to a devil’s spirit. These possessed individuals can look like mortals while
using devil stats, or use their original stats with the addition of a couple of
thematic powers. I guess this devil-summoning must be the Ashmadai’s primary
means of increasing their firepower, but since those possessions are framed as
the &lt;em&gt;price&lt;/em&gt; of the summonings I’m guessing the possessed are not directly
beholden to the cult’s hierarchy. Whether it’s possible to rescue them
from this possession is up to the GM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;player-tie-ins&quot;&gt;Player Tie-Ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Devil’s Pawn is on a collision course with the Ashmadai, who will make big
efforts to recruit them. They will also go after people who look like they can
rise to positions of power in Neverwinter, like the Noble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the cult tries to actively recruit the PCs or not, they can certainly
use their services against the aboleth menace. PCs who would never accept
working with diabolists might be approached by disguised agents intending to
point them at their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not actually stated anywhere within this entry, but other places in the
book say the Ashmadai control the above-ground portion of Oghma’s temple,
meaning Oghma’s Faithful is very likely to end up fighting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ashmadai are hard at work trying to infiltrate New Neverwinter, but they
haven’t managed to make any progress with Mayor Soman Galt (who, as we saw, is a
pawn of the aboleths already). Mordai himself is busily trying to convert
General Sabine of New Neverwinter to his cause, and has a good shot of managing
this as her natural disposition is compatible with the cult’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Abolethic Sovereignity is the competition, and they’re ahead. The cultists
ideally want to seal the chasm leading to their base, or otherwise drive them
off permanently, but they’re not even close to accomplishing this. The only
reason the Ashmadai are still around is that the aboleths don’t consider them a
serious threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the Ashmadai are nominally serving the Thayans while looking
for a way to break free of that servitude. They only do the minimum to prevent
Valindra from suspecting them, but their rebellious plot is doomed to failure as
Valindra does not have that relic scepter any more - she shipped it back to
Szass Tam as soon as she was done showing it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cult looks at the Netherese with much more genuine awe, though. They’ve
begun holding secret talks to forge an alliance, though they’re still having to
keep that hidden from the Thayans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as major factions go the Ashmadai are kinda weak. All of their major
goals and strategies lead them down a path that ends in a face-first collision
with one of the factions. They can’t recover the scepter because it’s not here
any more. They can’t corrupt New Neverwinter entirely because the aboleths got
there first. The direct approach to conquest doesn’t work because all the other
would-be conquerors are stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there’s a small chance that campaign events and PC actions end up
giving them a leg up, if only because the PCs open a power vacuum the cult can
exploit. I myself am not inclined to make them into a major threat, because it’s
always refreshing to have a group of villains you can easily stomp into the
ground.&lt;/p&gt;
