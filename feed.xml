        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Andropinis</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-andropinis.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Andropinis, who looks like a regal old wizard when he&apos;s not trying to kill
    you.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andropinis is the Sorcerer-King who rules the city of Balic. His official title
is Dictator, and his city has a lot of Greek and Roman elements as we saw in the
other thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the book says that Balic is clean, orderly, and mostly run along
democratic lines. Its templars, called praetors here, are elected to their
posts. Andropinis himself has an excellent reputation among his population, and
encourages the region’s tradition of ancestral worship and primal magic,
resulting in a remarkably fertile kingdom by Athasian standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the reasons for all of this are quite selfish. Andropinis has
mystically tied himself to the land and its ancestral spirits, and he teaches
his disciples to do the same. He encourages his people to love the land and tend
to it using primal magic because it increases his own power and makes the area
ripe for defiling. And obviously there’s never going to be elections for
Dictator if he has anything to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His magical ties to the land form the basis of Andropinis’ power, and he also
seems to be pursuing a more traditional draconic ascension path as a
defiler. While he normally looks like a strong human in late middle age, when
angry his features take on a reptilian cast, with golden scales appearing here
and there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we get stats for the man himself and some of the allies he is likely to
surround himself with. We’ll look at them in order of level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legionnaire-vestige&quot;&gt;Legionnaire Vestige&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those spirits venerated as Balic’s civic heroes. Andropinis can
summon them and order them around. It’s a Medium Shadow Animate and a Level 21
Minion Soldier with a ground speed of 6, a Flight speed of 5, Darkvision, and
immunity to immobilization. Them being Animates instead of Humanoids makes me
think the average Balic citizen is being misled about their true nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, every vestige has a &lt;strong&gt;Guarded Creature&lt;/strong&gt; chosen when they enter the
fight, usually their summoner or creator. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;Shade Spears&lt;/strong&gt; that
deal a bit of damage and mark the target until the vestige is defeated or the
encounter ends, whichever comes first. Yes, they can have multiple marked
targets if they last long enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a marked enemy attacks the vestige’s guarded creature, the vestige teleports
to space adjacent to their guarded creature as an interrupt, and grants the
guarded creature +4 to all defenses against the attack. If the attack misses,
the vestige drops to 0 HP. They’re jumping in front of the attack, essentially,
so they’ll want to mark as many enemies as possible to better defend their
charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;high-praetor&quot;&gt;High Praetor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of the highest-ranking templars of Balic, those chosen to stand by
their Dictator’s side. It’s a Level 22 Soldier with the Leader tag and 211
HP. Their ground speed is 7, and they have a teleport speed of 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re equipped like cliche Roman legionnaires, and their basic attack is a
&lt;strong&gt;short sword&lt;/strong&gt; that deals increased damage on opportunity attacks. They can use
it in a &lt;strong&gt;Face Cut&lt;/strong&gt; attack, which deals standard damage and dazes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They attack at range with &lt;strong&gt;eldritch javelins&lt;/strong&gt; that deal force damage and slow
(save ends). Once per encounter they can upgrade this to an &lt;strong&gt;Entrapping
Javelin&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals extra force damage and immobilizes (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;High Praetor Assault&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver lets them throw an Eldritch Javelin and
then charge. This also summons a legionnaire vestige, and lets the praetor
determine its guarded creature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The praetor’s soldierly skill is &lt;strong&gt;Prateor’s Mark&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them mark an
enemy within 20 squares for a turn with a minor action. Marked enemies grant
combat advantage when not adjacent to the praeto, and take 15 psychic damage if
they make an attack that doesn’t target the praetor. So unlike most soldier
monsters, high prateors want to be far away from enemies they mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;andropinis-sorcerer-king&quot;&gt;Andropinis, Sorcerer-King&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dictator of Balic is a Level 25 Elite Controller (Leader) with 468 HP, a
ground speed of 8, a flight speed of 5, darkvision, and blindsight 2. The fact
that he’s an Elite instead of a Solo means he will have a &lt;em&gt;sizable&lt;/em&gt; honor guard
made up of high praetors and epic-level mages when you fight him. The more
allies he has, the more dangerous he is, even beyond the usual encounter maths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andropinis’ ties to his city and the surrounding region manifest in several
ways. One of them is the &lt;strong&gt;Dictator’s Concord&lt;/strong&gt;, an aura (10) that gives a +2
bonus to saves for all allies inside, and allows them to save against charm,
fear, and stunning effects even if they would not normally allow saves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His &lt;strong&gt;Wound Pact&lt;/strong&gt; lets him automatically deal psychic damage to anyone who
damages him while he is already bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His basic melee attack is with a &lt;strong&gt;Pact Dagger&lt;/strong&gt;, which damages and knocks prone
on a hit. The first time Andropinis takes damage before the end of his next
turn, the target takes 10 damage and is slowed (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At range, he can use psychic powers to inflict &lt;strong&gt;Overwhelming Memories&lt;/strong&gt; on a
target, dealing psychic damage and sliding them 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggression Pact&lt;/strong&gt; lets him use one of the two basic attacks above &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; let
one ally he can see make a free basic attack. &lt;strong&gt;Land Pact&lt;/strong&gt; attacks enemies in a
Close Burst 3, deals untyped damage, and slows (save ends). While any target is
slowed by the power, Andropinis has Regeneration 15. Land Pact also causes 4
Legionnaire Vestiges to appear in the area, with Andropinis as their guarded
creature. It recharges when he is first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andropinis can also use &lt;strong&gt;Transposition&lt;/strong&gt; (move) to switch places with an
ally within 10 squares, and &lt;strong&gt;Dictator’s Authority&lt;/strong&gt; (minor) to let an ally take
a whole standard action right then and there. This, fortunately, only recharges
when he’s first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if Andropinis ever starts his turn without any allies within 10
squares, a legionnaire vestige automatically appears within 10 squares, with him
as the guarded creature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andropinis might outwardly seem to be one of the least bad sorcerer-kings, and a
good propspect for an alliance against his peers. Of course, Balic being
inspired by Greece and Rome means that it’s an enthusiastic practitioner of
slavery. Those nifty civil rights are for citizens, and then only if Andropinis
isn’t angry at them. And when the chips are down Andropinis would not hesitate
to drain his whole kingdom of life in order to protect himself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Abalach-Re</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-abalach-re.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Abalach-Re, who seems beautiful from a distance, but whose body-horror
    mutations become obvious when you get closer.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abalach-Re is a Sorcerer-Queen who rules the city of Raam as its Grand Vizier, a
title she chose because she claims to rule on behalf of a (fictional) deity
named Badna. Outwardly, she seems like a lazy, decadent and debauched ruler, who
lets her nobles make war on each other while her police forces oppress a
starving population and numerous rebellions grow right under her nose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, she’s a lot more aware of what goes on in her domain. It’s just that
she enjoys the cruelty on display, and likes to see those nascent rebellions
crushed. She &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; decadent and debauched, but even that is a fruit of her
explorations on the limits of her own physical form. This research has granted
her prodigious body manipulation abilities, which she teaches to her closest
agents and favored children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abalach-Re keeps a close eye on her peers and was the one who alerted them when
Dregoth got a bit too uppity. She makes sure to keep her own self-modification
experiments a secret from the other sorcerer-kings, as these are her chosen path
to ascension as a god-like being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raam’s day-to-day administration is in the hands of several noble houses, each
of which controls a different district. They’re more like organized crime
syndicates than anything else, constantly at each other’s throats and united
only in their desire to exploit the people under their charge. They’re aided in
this by the city’s police force. Its officers, the Mansabdars, theoretically
answer directly to the Queen, but in practice are all in the pockets of whatever
noble house oversees their beat, and are no more than brutal thugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abalach-Re lets them all do it because, as stated above, she likes the
cruelty. Instead of reining it in, she created an elite secret police force, the
High Kuotaghas, who actually enforce her will in the city and act to smack down
any noble who gets a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; confident. Kuotaghas often receive their
queen’s “gifts” and as such have access to some body horror powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Queen’s children are part of her court or members of the Kuotaghas,
but some have turned against her. She lets them, because all of ther children
have unknowingly been implanted with magical locator beacons. Even the
rebellious ones are useful tools to detect other rebels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get three entries here and as usual I’m going to talk about them in order of
ascending level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;street-mansabdar&quot;&gt;Street Mansabdar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical member of the force that should be enforcing the city’s laws but is
instead enforcing the will of some local warlord in exchange for fat
bribes. It’s a Level 7 Soldier with 76 HP and a speed of 6. Clad in hide armor,
it’s armed with a mace and a scourge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Mace&lt;/strong&gt; is our basic attack, which damages and marks on a hit. If a marked
target ignores the mark, the mansabdar can use its &lt;strong&gt;scourge&lt;/strong&gt; against them as
an interrupt. It does the same damage as the mace, and knocks prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the mansabdar can use &lt;strong&gt;Beat Down&lt;/strong&gt; against the prone target, which deals
the same damage as a basic mace strike and slows for a turn. If the target
stands up before the end of its next turn, it also takes ongoing 5 damage (save
ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;high-kuotagha&quot;&gt;High Kuotagha&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trusted agent of Abalach-Re, member of the group actually responsible for
enforcing her will in the city. While still tagged as a human in its stat block,
this kuotagha was &lt;em&gt;extensively&lt;/em&gt; mutated by his boss, which I’m sure will be a
nice surprise to the PCs. It’s a level 21 Lurker with 150 HP, a ground speed of
7, and a Spider Climb speed of 6. It also has low-light vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The kuotagha fights with &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt;, which target Reflex instead of AC, meaning
they’re the “shreds armor like paper” kind. It can also extrude a &lt;strong&gt;Flesh
Garrote&lt;/strong&gt; that does the same damage and grabs on a hit. This grab inflicts a -4
penalty to escape attempts, and there is no limit to the number of victims the
kuotagha can grab in this way. I’ll let you imagine how that works. All grabs
can be sustained at once with a single standard action, which also does some
automatic damage to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All other traits here depend on the kuotagha having one or more grabbed
victims. The &lt;del&gt;creature&lt;/del&gt; agent of the law can inflict criticals on its grabbed
victims on a 18-20 (which is very generous in 4e), has a +4 to all defenses
while it has a grabbed victim, and when someone attacks it while it’s grabbing
someone it can shift 1 square and slide any grabbed victims 1 square to a square
adjacent to it as in interrupt. This will only happen once per round, but it’s
gonna be &lt;em&gt;so annyoing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is a regular monster, meaning you could potentiall fight a whole team
of them at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;abalach-re-sorcerer-queen&quot;&gt;Abalach-Re, Sorcerer-Queen&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abalach-Re is a Level 23 Solo Controller with the Leader tag and 856 HP. Like
her henchthing above, she’s technically human, but “technically” is doing even
more heavy lifting in her case. As mentioned above, she’s seeking a custom path
to immorality that involves lot of self-bioengineering, and the fruits of this
are evident in this stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abalach-Re has low-light vision, a ground speed of 8, and a flight speed of 5
with hover and an altitude limit of 2. The &lt;strong&gt;Spirit Flight&lt;/strong&gt; trait gives her
insubstantial and phasing while she moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of her three basic attacks can be either melee 1 or ranged 10: &lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic
Thrust&lt;/strong&gt; targets Fortitude, deals physical damage, slides 5 squares and
immobilizes (save ends); &lt;strong&gt;Instinct Overload&lt;/strong&gt; targets Will, deals psychic
damage and lets Abalach-Re dictate the next move or standard action the target
will take on their turn, though she cannot force a victim to use a power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third basic attack is &lt;strong&gt;Disrupting Touch&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets Reflex and can be
either Melee 3 or Ranged 10. On a hit it deals physical damage and ongoing 10
force damage (save ends). Unlike the others, which are obviously psychic powers,
I think this one might be a touch spell where she stretches her arms really far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;strong&gt;Morphing Power Splice&lt;/strong&gt; lets Abalach-Re make three attacks with one
action without provoking opportunity attacks, so she could use any combination
of the above on the same turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can also lay down a &lt;strong&gt;Defiling Field&lt;/strong&gt;, creating a zone in a Close Burst 3
that lasts until the end of the encounter. Any enemy that takes damage within
the zone also takes ongoing 15 necrotic damage (save ends). Thankfully this is
an encounter power, but it recharges when she’s first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her movement power is &lt;strong&gt;Allocation&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets her teleport 10 squares and
then slide any enemy adjacent to her at the arrival point 5 squares. This also
recharges when she’s first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to all of the above, when Abalach-Re is hit with any attack she can
use &lt;strong&gt;Vengeance of Adaptive Flesh&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction. This is a Ranged 10 attack
that targets Will, and deals 15 ongoing damage of the same type she just took
(save ends). Like all of her other ranged attacks, this doesn’t provoke
opportunity attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks to me like she wants to stay mostly away from the PCs, using her powers
to slide them into the defiling field so she can further damage them with more
attacks and ongoing damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty strong opening for this section, and a brief look tells me
Abalach-Re is likely the weakest of the Sorcerer Kings. She doesn’t seem to have
any particular resistance against being stunlocked by PC powers, so even though
she’s a solo you might want to add some high kuotagha bodyguards to her fight.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Dragon of Tyr</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-dragon-of-tyr.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    The Dragon of Tyr, making a dapper pose for the camera.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry appeared among the monsters, right where you’d find standard dragons
in another monster book. I thought this was odd, because he’s the only dragon in
Athas and also one of its more important “personages”, so why isn’t he in that
section?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer, I suspect, is because to be in the Personages section the character
has to be someone who could be a potential ally to the PCs, and the Dragon of
Tyr is not someone any party of PCs should be allying with. Instead, he’s the
final boss of Dark Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless I’m talking about him here, because he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an important personage
and knowing his story gives a lot of context for the sorcerer-kings you’ll also
find in this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone in Athas knows and fears the Dragon of Tyr. This great and terrible
monster comes in from somewhere on the other side of the Sea of Silt every once
in a while, and demands a huge tribute of treasure and slaves. Even the
sorcerer-kings fear him, and so they scramble to meet his demands. Once that’s
done, the Dragon flies home with his loot, leaving the region alone until his
next appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is common knowledge. Only the sorcerer-kings themselves know the
full story: the Dragon was once one of them. His original name was Borys the
Butcher, and like his colleagues he was one of the fifteen secret apprentices of
Rajaat the Sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, arcane magic on Athas is a truly unnatural phenomenon, a flaw that
slipped into the world when the primordials defeated the gods way back when
Athas was still green. Rajaat was the first mortal to discover and master arcane
magic. He was also the first to learn that you could pull more power from the
life around you to cast bigger spells - in other words, the first defiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajaat taught dozens of pupils, but he only taught the secret of defiling to his
inner circle of fifteen secret apprentices. For Rajaat was a major asshole, and
when he felt his Champions were ready, he ordered them to go out on a worldwide
genocidal rampage to cleanse Athas of all the species he deemed “impure”. So
much defiling magic was flung around in those wars that Athas’ previously green
ecosystem was completely destroyed, starting the world’s transformation into the
desert it is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, even the Champions became convinced that all of this was a bit too
much. Led by Borys, they turned on their master and managed to imprison him in a
pocket dimension outside of time and space. Once Rajaat was out of the picture,
the former Champions quickly conquered or built city-states in one of the last
habitable regions of Athas, setting themselves up as the Sorcerer-Kings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By then, they knew that attaining the pinnacle of power as a defiler would lead
to transformation into a dragon. Borys, who had taken it upon himself to guard
Rajaat’s prison, successfully argued that the other Sorcerer-Kings should help
him speedrun the transformation, since he’d need the power to contain their
former master forever. And so they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ritual for the final transformation required the sacrifice of every citizen
of Ebe, the island city Borys ruled. Borys renamed the resulting hellish
wasteland Ur Draxa, the City of Doom. The Dragon dwells in the ruins of Ur
Draxa’s palace to this day, leaving the city only to collect his tributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city itself is inhabited by a very large number of undead, and by the living
slaves brought in as tribute. The city’s day to day operation is in the hands of
the Dead Lords, a council of liches who serve the Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dragon keeps their soul vessels (the book uses the p-word here) hidden deep
within his palace to ensure compliance. He is wise to do this, for the Lord
Vizier who leads the council has his own agenda. He’s secretly researching a way
to cross into the Astral Sea and escape Athas altogether, and often sends his
personal minions out on missions to recover any bit of planar lore he hears
about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get stats for the Dragon of Tyr and for the Lord Vizier in this entry. The
two are completely different, of course, so we’ll cover all their traits in
their respective entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dragon-of-tyr&quot;&gt;The Dragon of Tyr&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only dragon in Athas is a Gargantuan Natural Magical Beast with the Dragon
tag (obviously). He’s also a Level 33 Solo Controller with 1216 HP, Darkvision,
ground and flight speeds of 10, and a teleport speed of 5. He can hover,
too. His alignment is Chaotic Evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Dragon’s Actions&lt;/strong&gt; trait means old Borys doesn’t roll initiative at
all. He has three whole turns per round at initiative counts 40, 30, and 20. He
cannot delay or ready actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His basic attack is a massive Reach 4 &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and strips all
necrotic and psychic resistance on a hit (save ends). His &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; deals more or
less the same damage and immobilizes (save ends), with a Slow aftereffect (save
ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can also use wider swipes to perform the &lt;strong&gt;Raking Claws&lt;/strong&gt; attack, attacking
all enemies in a Close Blast 4 for slightly less damage than the single-target
version and also sliding them 2 squares on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for physical attacks. Now for the spells and psychic powers, because
of course he has both!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Dragon’s Defiling&lt;/strong&gt; is a hazard all on its own, targetting all creatures
in a Close Burst 5 and dealing necrotic damage on a hit. He can use the energy
gathered with this to cast &lt;strong&gt;Defiling Death&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10), dealing heavy
necrotic damage and ongoing 20 necrotic damage to the target (save ends). After
the first failed save, the ongoing damage increases to 30!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dragon of Tyr starts the fight with Defiling Death charged, and once it’s
cast he must hit with Dragon’s Defiling to recharge the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Dragon is bloodied, he can use his &lt;strong&gt;Breath of Shredding Sand&lt;/strong&gt;,
attacking all creatures in a &lt;em&gt;Close Blast 20&lt;/em&gt; and dealing the same amount of
damage as the bite on a hit, half on a miss. Fortunately this is an encounter
power and doesn’t recharge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the PCs manage to surround Borys, he can use a &lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic Pulse&lt;/strong&gt;
(encounter), a Close Burst 5 that deals the same damage as the bite, pushes its
targets 5 squares, and knocks them prone. On a miss, it deals half damage and
pushes 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dragon can use his move action on a &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Uplift&lt;/strong&gt;, automatically
pushing every adjacent enemy 2 squares and flying his Speed + 2 (i.e, 12
squares). If an enemy ends its movement within 4 squares of the Dragon, he can
hit them with his &lt;strong&gt;Lashing Tail&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction, dealing the same damage as the
claw and knocking them prone. And when the dragon is first bloodied, Telekinetic
Pulse recharges and he can use it immediately as a free action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical attacks all target AC, the necrotic and tekekinetic ones all target
Fortitude, and the sand breath targets Reflex. As the most powerful arcane
caster in the whole world, you can say he knows pretty much every ritual in the
game for use outside of combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-lord-vizier&quot;&gt;The Lord Vizier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the oldest and most powerful lich among the council of Dead Lords, which
makes him their leader. Ostensibly, he un-lives to serve his master the Dragon,
but as we saw he’s also privately looking for a way off this dying rock. He is a
Medium Natural Humanoid with the Undead tag, and Level 26 Elite Artillery. He
has Speed 6, and Darkvision. He’s immune to diseases like all undead, and has
Resist 15 Necrotic and Resist 10 Poison. His alignment is Evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord Vizier has a &lt;strong&gt;Necrotic Aura&lt;/strong&gt; (5) that deals 10 necrotic damage to
anyone who enters it or starts their turn inside. Like all liches, he’s
&lt;strong&gt;Indestructible&lt;/strong&gt; while his soul vessel remains intact: when reduced to 0 HP,
his body and possessions become dust and reform within 1d10 days near the
vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wields the &lt;strong&gt;Dead Lord’s Scepter&lt;/strong&gt;, and his basic attack is to bonk someone
with it, dealing lightning-and-necrotic damage. His basic ranged attack is the
&lt;strong&gt;Grasp of the Dead&lt;/strong&gt; spell (range 20 vs. Fortitude), which deals necrotic
damage and lets one undead creature adjacent to the target make a free melee
basic attack. If the attack hits, the creature marks the target for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can also cast a &lt;strong&gt;Plume of Death&lt;/strong&gt; (area 2 within 10 vs. Fortitude, recharge
5+), a fireball-sized spell that deals acid-and-necrotic damage and summons a
Vizier’s Skeleton on a square within the burst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a move action, the Lord can draw on his secret knowledge and perform a brief
&lt;strong&gt;Planar Displacement&lt;/strong&gt;, teleporting 15 squares and leaving a brand-new Vizier’s
Skeleton in the origin square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;viziers-skeleton&quot;&gt;Vizier’s Skeleton&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sophisticated undead minions are constantly produced by the Lord Vizier’s
special attacks, and he will probably have a whole bunch of them on hand when
the fight starts in addition to some powerful non-minion undead. They’re Medium
Natural Animates (undead) and Level 26 Minion Brutes who fight with &lt;strong&gt;Deadflame
Swords&lt;/strong&gt; that do fire-and-necrotic damage, and can shoot &lt;strong&gt;Chill Shards&lt;/strong&gt;
(Ranged 10) to do cold-and-necrotic damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When met outside his city, the Dragon is always alone and on a specific
mission. He will usually completely ignore most people who have nothing to do
with his goal, believing they are beneath his notice. Of course, if those people
are stupid enough to pick a fight with him, he is only too glad to oblige,
completely confident of his victory and with good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he is attacked &lt;em&gt;in Ur Draxa&lt;/em&gt;, I imagine the Dead Lords would join the fight
too. Better bring an army or ten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord Vizier generally obeys the Dragon’s every order and kills whoever he
wants dead. I wonder if he can be met in friendlier terms when following his own
agenda. Epic PCs would make perfect agents for recovering that lost lore without
the Dragon noticing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Personages of Athas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’d normally expect a monster book to end right after the “Zombie” entry, but
we’re only at the two-third mark on this one. We’re now entering the section on
the “Personages of Athas”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has a really short intro for it, explaining that it takes a lot of
skill and luck to survive for long in this world, and that this is a sample of
people who managed to do exactly that and are therefore remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the entries in this section and the ones in the monster
section are not mechanical. As far as I can understand, every entry in this
section concerns one or more specific individuals. And while I haven’t read
every entry yet, I also suspect the book doesn’t expect them to automatically be
your enemies. They could be entirely neutral to your goals, or they might even
be potential allies. While one of these things is also often true about the
monster entries, both should be true for everyone in this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is why the Dragon of Tyr was in the monster section. He is a
specific individual, but he’s also the “final boss” of Dark Sun. By default,
he’s not particularly interested in making new alliances and no PC party who
isn’t completely rotten to the core would think of allying with him for real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sorcerer-Kings, however, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in the Personages section, because I imagine
PCs might want to form temporary alliances with some of them against the
others. We’ll also see a bunch of much lower level randos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stated in an earlier post, I decided to move the Dragon’s description to
this section as I consider him to be more of a Personage than a monster. So
we’ll start with him on the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Creature Catalog: Zombie</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-zombie.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    This is similar to a zombie, but it seems to be a repurposed
    picture of another creature.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zombies in Athas have the same origin as zombies in every other D&amp;amp;D world:
they’re created either intentionally by necromancy, or accidentally from dead
bodies left for long enough in areas exposed to strong necrotic energies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Athas that means areas touched by the Gray, the Darker and Sunnier version of
the Shadowfell. Any bodies left in these places have a high chance of rising as
zombies. As the natural environment in these areas tends to be particularly
harsh as well, they can do interesting things to these bodies before they rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common of those is that by the time the body rises its flesh is long
gone due to the actions of predators and scouring winds, so you get a skeleton
instead. But some places like the ones named below can preserve the flesh of a
corpse, giving enough time to rise as a Darker and Sunnier Zombie with extra
powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zombies described in this entry are Natural Humanoids, which I think
is an error because every other zombie is a Natural Animate. In any case, they
have the Undead tag and the usual immunity to poison and disease and resistance
to necrotic damage. They also tend to be faster than standard zombie varieties
(which still exist in Athas!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;salt-zombie&quot;&gt;Salt Zombie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are created from the big necrotic zone in the Salt Meres. They tend to lie
beneath the salt flats, erupting out of the ground when they sense living beings
walking the surface. They probably look dried out and mummified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt Zombies are Level 1 Soldiers with 28 HP and a ground speed of 6. Their
necrotic resistance is 5 and they have Vulnerable 5 to Radiant damage. Their
basic &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; damage and grab on a hit, but their &lt;strong&gt;Salt Feast&lt;/strong&gt; attack is
usually more effective: it does the same damage and also grabs, but the target
has a -4 penalty to escape the grab and takes another 5 damage every time they
fail. And of course, the zombie can also keep attacking the grabbed target
either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also suffer from the &lt;strong&gt;Zombie Weakness&lt;/strong&gt; that afflicts a lot of standard
zombies, and so are instantly destroyed when someone scores a critical hit on
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;black-reaver-zombies&quot;&gt;Black Reaver Zombies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There originate from the Black Sands region. Legend has it that an ancient act
of defiling magic summoned these sands into the region, and that they drained
the souls of everyone they touched. There’s a creepy deserted city at its
center, which was presumably the target of this magical WMD. Modern Athasians
tend to give it a wide berth, and anyone who dies here will probably rise as one
of these zombies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black Reavers are Level 5 Lurkers with 51 HP and a zippy ground speed
of 7. They’re blind, and so have the corresponding tag and are immune to
blinding and gaze attacks, perceiving the world through their
Blindsight 10. Their necrotic resistant is 10, and while they don’t take extra
damage from radiant damage it does prevent them from using their Shadow Burst
power for a turn, basically defanging them for that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, their basic &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; does a relatively weak mix of physical and
necrotic damage, so they really need the extra necrotic damage from attacking a
target that couldn’t see them at the start of their turn in order to be a threat
to equivalent-level PCs. And the most likely way for them to get that bonus is
&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Burst&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+), a move action that lets them teleport 5 squares
and create a Burst 1 zone that blinds everyone inside around their arrival
point. This zone lasts for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using these in an encounter, you might want to add plenty of
vision-blocking terrain to the battle map, like ruined buildings or big rocks. A
zombie without Shadow Burst could still get that damage bonus if it was behind
such terrain before charging out and attacking, something its high Speed would
help with. Darkness also helps, but not as much since PCs are likely to have
many options for lighting up the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feasting-zombie&quot;&gt;Feasting Zombie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one appears in the Forest Ridge where halflings live. Halflings who catch
terminal diseases are not eaten when they die, for obvious reasons. Instead,
they’re buried, which is believed to return them to nature’s embrace. This
alternate funerary practice is less effective at preventing them from rising as
zombies when conditions are right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feasting zombies are Small, since they originate from halflings, and they’re
Level 6 Minion Brutes with Speed 5. They &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;, and when they die they
perform a &lt;strong&gt;Clamping Bite Death Chomp&lt;/strong&gt;, which does the same damage as the bite
attack and also slows (save ends) because the dead zombie doesn’t let go until
you pry it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cinder-zombies&quot;&gt;Cinder Zombies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were killed and preserved by fire. This could be because they lived in
some of the volcanic islands in the Sea of Silt, of because their village was
torched by raiders. They’re charred instead of rotten, and therefore smell of
burned meat. They’re also quite strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinder Zombies are Level 12 Soldiers with 121 HP and Speed 5. They have Resist
Necrotic 15, Resist Fire 10, and Vulnerable Radiant 5. They project an aura of
&lt;strong&gt;Burning Embers&lt;/strong&gt; that deal 10 fire damage to any enemy who leaves the aura,
giving them an incentive to remain close. They pummel enemies with their &lt;strong&gt;Fists
of Cinder&lt;/strong&gt; that do a mix of physical and fire damage. If an enemy within their
aura makes an attack that doesn’t target them, the zombie uses &lt;strong&gt;Punishing
Sparks&lt;/strong&gt; on them to deal a bit of fire damage on a hit. When the creature is
first bloodied, it releases a &lt;strong&gt;Choking Cloud&lt;/strong&gt; that attacks the Fortitude of
enemies in a Close Burst 3. On a hit it deals poison damage and prevents them
from spending healing surges (save ends). On a miss it deals half damage and
prevents surge expenditure for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the four zombie types presented here are new, they’re still zombies. You
use them in the same way you use standard zombies which, again, exist on
Athas. I think I like the cinder zombies the most, as they have an interesting
Defender Aura-like setup and fire zombies make sense in non-Athas settings too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While three of the four zombies presented here are strongly associated with
their specific home regions, there’s nothing preventing an enterprising villain
from importing them to wherever their lair is, or from somehow replicating the
process of their creation in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Wight</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-wight.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A wight posing in a threatening manner.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athasian wights are, at their root, pretty much the same as standard ones:
undead whose soulless bodies are animated by a scrap of animus (or will) the
dead person left behind. However, their description here goes on to say that
wights were driven to complete some kind of mission or achieve an important goal
when they died, and the “will” that animates them is an obsession with
fulfilling that task. It also gives them an eternal hunger for life force, and
robs them of the capacity to feel anything but hatred, grief, and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can technically exorcize a wight by fulfilling its task. This is extremely
difficult &lt;em&gt;at best&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s often impossible. Wights are not exactly willing
to give detailed interviews about the circumstances of their death. Even if the
PCs can discover those many of the creatures have been dead for so long that all
people and places involved are simply gone. This will probably force the PCs to
resort to the second most effective anti-wight strategy: extreme violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a wight to be truly destroyed, its body must be obliterated. A popular
tactic is to dismember and then burn their corpses. Not doing this means the
creature will restore itself and return eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wights presented here are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead keyword,
and a bunch of traditional undead traits: Darkvision, immunity to disease and
poison, 10 resistance to necrotic damage, and and 5 or 10 vulnerability to
Radiant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These wights tend to lack the default ability to eat your healing surges, but
they gain other individualized tricks in its place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wight-thrall&quot;&gt;Wight Thrall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the exception to the wight lore I described above because they’re
&lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; living their best unlife. Their obsession was to serve their beloved
master for all eternity, and that’s exactly what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wight thralls have about as much initiative as your typical zombie, but they’re
&lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better at following their master’s commands. If you find these, their
master is likely nearby, either as a more powerful wight or as some other
monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures are Level 12 Minion Brutes with a speed of 7 and the standard
traits mentioned above (except radiant vulnerability). Their &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; damage
and have a life drain effect that’s modeled slightly differently: targets hit by
the attack cannot gain temporary HP at all and recover 5 less HP from healing
effects (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When destroyed by non-radiant damage, their &lt;strong&gt;Dark Passing&lt;/strong&gt; ability restores 5
HP to a nearby undead ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dune-runner-wight&quot;&gt;Dune Runner Wight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an elf who died trying to deliver an important message or warning to
their community. Every night they arise and try to complete the impossible run,
only to appear back at the starting point when the sun rises. During the day,
they terrorize nearby creatures to vent their frustration and slake their
thirst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dune Runner Wights are level 12 Minion Skirmishers with 124 HP and the common
traits mentioned above. Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; have no effect beyond their decent
damage, but they deal extra damage if the runner moved at least 4 squares before
attacking, and can be used as part of a &lt;strong&gt;Mobile Melee Attack&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver that
lets the runner move its speed without and attack at any point during the move
without provoking an opportunity attack from the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a 1/round minor action, they can try to afflict someone with a &lt;strong&gt;Running
Curse&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5 vs. Will), which forces at target to move at least 4 squares
on their turn or take a bit of psychic damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oath-wight&quot;&gt;Oath Wight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These used to be inhabitants of one of Athas’ many ancient ruins, who were on
the verge of completing an important task when their entire city was leveled by
a sorcerous WMD of some kind. Maybe they were scholars nearing a research
breakthrough, maybe they were thieves about to pull that big score… or maybe
they were mothers undergoing childbirth. So there’s some nightmare fuel for
ya. They’re Level 14 Elite Controllers with 140 HP and a speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their frustration with the futility of their task is so potent it leaks out, and
can be used as a weapon. This aura of &lt;strong&gt;Inevitable Failure&lt;/strong&gt; inflicts a -2
penalty to attacks, skill checks, and defenses to any non-dominated enemies
inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wight can dominate enemies with its &lt;strong&gt;Accursed Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (minor action, ranged
5 vs. Will), which dominates for a turn on a hit. It can also use the
&lt;strong&gt;Frustration’s Fury&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power, which attacks the Will of 2 nearby
targets. On a hit, it reals psychic damage and forces the target to make a free
melee basic attack (or a charge!)  against another target of the wight’s
choice. If this secondary attack &lt;em&gt;misses&lt;/em&gt;, the target is dominated (save
ends). A miss with the power deals half damage and dazes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Frustration’s Fury is unavailable, the wight uses its basic &lt;strong&gt;Rotting
Touch&lt;/strong&gt;, which does necrotic damage and prevents HP recovery for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were wondering why the wight has so little HP for an elite, it’s because
reaching 0 HP triggers its &lt;strong&gt;Promised Return&lt;/strong&gt; power, causing it to reappear
with full HP near its last position at the start of its next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description of wights as the products of obsession that lingers beyond death
is so cool that I’m tempted to make this the default description of wights in
any game I run. The mechanics of the ones presented here are interesting and
help bring them into the paragon tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wights might very rarely work with the living if they can convince the creature
they have similar goals, but they mostly hang out with other undead or with
predatory beasts who don’t see them as food.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Thri-Kreen</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-thri-kreen.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A thri-kreen mantis warrior with a green carapace.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thri-kreen are the famous mantis-people of Athas. A slightly more generic
version of them appeared in the Monster Manual 3, and now we get more NPC stat
blocks here and a playable version in the Campaign Guide. Unlike what happened
to muls a few pages back, thri-kreen in the Creature Catalog are given a
description that’s about as positive as the one for the playable version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thri-kreen have deep instinctual bonds of loyalty to their “clutch” and their
“pack”. As the Campaign Guide explains, a clutch is a small group of at most six
individuals to whom the thri-kreen feels closest, and a pack is an extended
family composed of multiple clutches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally a clutch is formed by individuals who hatched from their eggs at
around the same time, but kreen can “adopt” other clutches over time if
circumstances demand. For PCs, this means their adventuring party is their
clutch. NPC kreen away from their homes will have similar arrangements with
their ally groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those ubiquitous asshole slavers like to steal Thri-kreen eggs so that their can
exploit their bonding instinct, making them extremely loyal to their new
masters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thri-kreen packs prefer to hunt non-sapient creatures for food, but they will
make exceptions in truly desperate times. They will fight with all their
strenght to protect themselves from attacks by other people, but will almost
never be the aggressors in such fights. Their spiritual leaders are known as
desert talkers, and are responsible for maintaining their connection to the
primal spirits of the desert and those of their ancestors. This gives them a
very long genetic memory, stretching back to an ancient age where they had their
own great empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These NPC thri-kreen are Medium Natural Humanoids with Low-Light Vision. The
ones here have ground speeds between 6 and 7, slightly slower than the MM3
ones. Their signature ability remains &lt;strong&gt;Mantis Jump&lt;/strong&gt;, an move-action encounter
power that lets them jump their speed without provoking opportunity
attacks. This is indeed different from the power PCs get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get three new stat blocks here, which can be mixed in with the ones from the
MM3 without any extra work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thri-kreen-bounder&quot;&gt;Thri-Kreen Bounder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are less experienced hunters who are still learning the tricks of the
trade by observing the pack’s veterans at work. They tend to be a little more
skittish than those veterans. They’re Level 6 Minion Skirmishers with a ground
speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Deft Dodger&lt;/strong&gt; trait gives them +2 to defenses against ranged attacks,
which helps them survive longer in a fight. They attack in melee with &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt;
and at range with thrown &lt;strong&gt;Chatkchas&lt;/strong&gt;, which are three-pointed throwing blades
with Range 6/12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of Mantis Jump they have &lt;strong&gt;Mantis Bound&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them jump 3
squares without provoking opportunity attacks as a reaction to being missed by
an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thri-kreen-mauler&quot;&gt;Thri-Kreen Mauler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the veteran hunters, big and beefy thri-kreen who single out a quarry,
jump on top of it, and tear it apart. They’re Level 8 Brutes with 105 HP and a
speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack is way too weak for a level 8 brute (average damage
9), but &lt;strong&gt;Mauler Frenzy&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+) lets them make two of those, three when
bloodied. &lt;strong&gt;Mauler Leap&lt;/strong&gt; lets them jump 6 squares and make two claw attacks
with a +1 to attack and a +4 to damage, which definitely matches the
formula. This recharges when they’re first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the mauler hits a bloodied target with their claws, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Pain
Amplification&lt;/strong&gt; against that rarget with a minor action, attacking their
Fortitude. A hit causes the target to take ongoing 5 psychic damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If multiple claw attacks aren’t on the cards this turn, the mauler can use its
&lt;strong&gt;Chatkchas&lt;/strong&gt; at range, which do level-appropriate physical damage. Mantis Jump
rounds out their arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Maulers will try to avoid getting killed like any opponent, they don’t
mind getting bloodied since it makes them stronger. They probably should try to
open the fight with a Leap, get stuck in for a Frenzy or two, and then jump away
for that second use of Mauler Leap once bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thri-kreen-mantis-warrior&quot;&gt;Thri-Kreen Mantis Warrior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mantis Warriors are hunt leaders, highly skilled with both weapons and psychic
powers. They’re Level 10 Elite Soldiers with 208 HP and a ground speed of 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They still have their &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt;, and also carry a &lt;strong&gt;Gythka&lt;/strong&gt;, a light polearm
with a trident-like head on either end. Both do equivalent damage, but the
gythka marks for a turn on a hit and does a blend of physical and psychic damage
instead of just physical. They can also throw &lt;strong&gt;Chatkchas&lt;/strong&gt;, though these are a
bit weaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Mantis Flurry&lt;/strong&gt; ability allows the warrior to make a claw and a gythka
attack, or to throw two chatkchas, with a single action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally they can pull off a &lt;strong&gt;Springing Assault&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+): this lets
them jump 4 squares, make a gythka attack, then jump another 3 and make another
gythka attack. None of this movement provokes opportunity attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter they can perform a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Wrench&lt;/strong&gt;, attacking the Will of all
enemies in a Close Burst 2. On a hit this deals psychic damage and marks for a
turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an adjacent marked enemy moves, shifts, or makes an attack that doesn’t
target the warrior, it can cause a &lt;strong&gt;Spasm&lt;/strong&gt; as an interrupt. This is an attack
against Will that does psychic damage on a hit, knocks the target prone, and
slows them until the end of the warrior’s next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three stat blocks combined with the Ambusher, Scout, and Sand Talker from
the MM3 will let you build a large variety of thri-kreen encounters. They can
also be part of “found clutches”, AKA Mixed Groups of Humanoids, voluntarily or
not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I note that the MM3 Thri-Kreen are described as using “spears” and “shuriken”,
which clearly correspond to the gythkas and chatkchas used by these ones. A
simple find-and-replace of the names should work, as there is no mechanical
difference between them in the stat blocks themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Thrax</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-thrax.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A thrax holding what remains of his latest victim.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there was a town named Gerot at the foot of a mountain near the
city-state of Raam. Its people were great warriors, but also haugthy. When the
Sorcerer Queen Abalach-Re sent them an offer of alliance in exchange for them
joining Raam’s legions, they signaled their refusal by killing the envoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abalach-Re was obviously very angry at this, so she double-cursed the people of
Gerot: they would be afflicted with an unquenchable thirst &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; pure water
would become like a poison to them. In short order, the entire town was
dead. The bit the queen hadn’t predicted was that the dead of Gerot would rise
again, as the first thraxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thrax is a water vampire. Still afflicted by the sorcerous curse, it suffers
from constant, unquenchable thirst, which it tries to satisfy by draining the
fluids from the flesh of the living. Thrax victims become desiccated husks, and
it’s said to be an agonizing death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a standard D&amp;amp;D vampire, a thrax seems to retain the mind and personality
it had in life. This means they’re even more miserable, tormented not just by
their cursed thirst but also by their regret at having to feed. Prime personal
horror material there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, we’re talking about the thraxes that seek revenge on
Abalach-Re by haunting Raam and drinking her supporters dry. I imagine those are
a fair bit less conflicted than the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thraxes can drain fluids through skin contact, and they also have this trick
where they can cause a victim’s fluids to all move close to the skin, making the
victim bloated and easier to drain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only get a single stat block here, so let’s get right to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thrax&quot;&gt;Thrax&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thrax shown here is Medium Natural Humanoid (undead) and a Level 11 Lurker
with 88 HP, putting it about on par with the traditional vampires from the
Monster Vault. It has darkvision, Resist 10 Necrotic, and Vulnerable 5
Radiant. Unlike a lot of other undead, it has no special resistance against
poison and disease. And unlike a traditional vampire, it is not vulnerable to
natural sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thraxes are surrounded by &lt;strong&gt;Roiling Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; which give them +2 to defenses
against ranged attacks, and their &lt;strong&gt;Clinging Grasp&lt;/strong&gt; makes them insubstantial
and immune to forced movement while they have a creature grabbed. This takes
away the PC’s easiest tactic for making them let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is the &lt;strong&gt;Grasp of the Dead&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals necrotic damage. If
the thrax has combat advantage, a hit also grabs the victim, which has a -5
penalty to escape rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it has a creature grabbed, the thrax can proceed to &lt;strong&gt;Drain Fluids&lt;/strong&gt;, which
deals heavy necrotic damage, heals the thrax for 10 HP, and ends the grab. If the
attack bloodies the target, they also fall unconscious (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thrax can also attack with &lt;strong&gt;Flesh Bloat&lt;/strong&gt;, the “trick” mentioned
above. This is an at-will melee attack that deals a bit more necrotic damage
than the Grasp, and also dazes and slows the target (save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard tactics for a thrax will likely be to bloat their intended victim, grab
them with Grasp of the Dead, and then Drain Fluids, repeating as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water vampires feel much more appropriate for Dark Sun than the traditional
blood kind. I’m guessing all the traditional vampires in Athas must have melted
in the heat from all those layers they tend to wear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thraxes will probably only join up with other thraxes, and a fight against five
of them will be nightmarish for the party. You could also mix it up with other
relatively “dry” undead types. Maybe angry ghosts, or the animated corpses of
their dried-out victims.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Tembo</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-tembo.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A tembo, who looks like a giant scaled rat with sabertooth fangs.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our previous entry was kind of vague about whether tareks were a product of
the genocidal “Cleansing Wars” in Athas’ distant past, this one is pretty
categorical. Tembos are bioengineered terror weapons, created using magic most
foul for the purposes of facilitating genocide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Champions” of that time (which unknown to most are the sorcerer-kings of
today) created them to sneak upon the homes of their opponents, and take from
them those they loved most. In addition to their stealthy forms and sharp fangs,
they received a limited ability to blend with shadows, the power to bite
someone in the soul, and a sophisticated intellect that is entirely devoted to
finding new ways of fulfilling their purpose in crueler ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have survived as a species to this day, roaming mainly through the western
wastelands of the Tyr region, but they have been sighted elsewhere too. There’s
no one to give them specific targets any more, so they choose their victims
themselves, for food and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirmation that a tembo is targetting a settlement is one of the only things
that will immediately end any infighting and other disagreements and make its
whole population unite against the threat. Everyone hates these things more than
they hate each other, which is saying something in Athas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How exactly these attacks happen vary with the creature’s whims, as well as with
what it judges to be the most effective tactic for a given situation. Sometimes
they stay hidden and let their deadly magical aura slowly kill the population,
and sometimes they tear people apart in broad daylight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tembos are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts and Level 6 Solo Skirmishers with 280
HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;Killing Presence&lt;/strong&gt; acts as an aura (2) that deals 5 necrotic damage
to anyone who starts their turn inside. When the tembo is bloodied, its &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt;
aura kicks in. &lt;strong&gt;Tainted Wounds&lt;/strong&gt; (aura 5) halves any HP recovery from healing
effects for those inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a solo, the tembo has &lt;strong&gt;Double Actions&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning it rolls initiative twice
and takes full turns in both counts. And finally, it’s &lt;strong&gt;Immovable&lt;/strong&gt;, being
completely immune to any kind of forced movement, and getting a free save
against being knocked prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monster’s main attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; that damages, inflicts a -2 attack
penalty for a turn, and serves as a carrier for the &lt;strong&gt;Unspeakable Violation&lt;/strong&gt;
secondary attack. This targets Fortitude, and on a hit eats a healing surge and
doubles the damage from Killing Presence against that target for a
turn. Fortunately, it has Recharge 6+, so it doesn’t happen with every bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its attack it’s likely to use the most is a &lt;strong&gt;Raking Assault&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals the
same damage as the bite then lets the Tembo shift 4 squares and use the bite. So
that’s two or three attacks for the price of one, with the creature being able
to do this two times per round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its camouflage powers take two forms: &lt;strong&gt;Blending&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) is a move action
that makes the tembo invisible for a turn or until its next attack. And &lt;strong&gt;Shadow
Evasion&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge when first bloodied) is a reaction that triggers when it’s
hit by a melee or ranged attack, letting it shift 4 squares and become
insubstantial for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having two full turns per round can actually make Blending last even less, so
it’s not something a tembo will use to lie in wait for a long time. It will
instead rely on mundane stealth for this. Then it will charge in, use as many
Raking Assault flurries as it can, and combine Shadow Evasion with Blending to
escape from sight, only coming back to attack when its enemies’ guards are
down. Its ability to delete healing surges makes such long-term harassment
tactics even more effective, since it will obviously attack you in your sleep
and stop you from taking a long rest. Fighting the creature to the finish
in a single encounter will require preventing its escape somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a horrible, horrible monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tembos are almost always found alone. As mentioned above, everyone hates these
things. They will sometimes join together in small packs, but these end up
breaking apart pretty soon because they suck at organizing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Tarek</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-tarek.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A tarek raider. He&apos;s a large, muscular, blue-skinned humanoid with a bald
    head, large pointy ears, and large pointy teeth.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re back to using the s-word for this one, though it only appears once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the book, legends tell that “an entity of mad destruction” created
the tareks in the very distant past to serve as “instruments of murder”. I guess
this means that they were created as bioweapons for the genocidal wars of the
Red Age, which would explain why they’re so strong and tough. In any case, their
earth priests helped them revolt against their masters and attain independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our narrative present, tareks live in isolated communities in Athas’ hilly
and moutainous regions. They’re intensely isolationist and xenophobic, so most
of the contact they have with other humanoids is when they raid any of their
communities that might be located too near to tarek territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they seemingly hate everyone, they are “sworn enemies of the gith”. Like
all particularly strong humanoid species, they’re popular targets for slavers
because they do well at the arena. It’s no wonder most revolts in Athas seem to
start there…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tareks are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 6. Their signature
trait is &lt;strong&gt;Deathless Warrior&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them roll a save when they hit 0
HP. If they pass, they only drop at the end of their next turn, and can act
normally until them. They speak Common and Giant, and are Unaligned by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book recommends adding additional varieties of tarek by taking orc stat
blocks and replacing their bonus charge speed and Warrior’s Surge with Deathless
Warrior. So I guess they’re explicitly Darker and Sunnier orcs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tarek-raider&quot;&gt;Tarek Raider&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raiders are Level 3 Soldiers with 49 HP. They’re disciplined and try to stick
together in a fight even if scattered by forced movement. Their &lt;strong&gt;Tarek Squad
Tactics&lt;/strong&gt; give them Combat Advantage against anyone adjacent to at least one
other Tarek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A raider is usually armed with a &lt;strong&gt;Bone Heartpick&lt;/strong&gt; whose attacks damage, slide
1 square, and mark for a turn on a hit. If someone decides to ignore the mark,
their &lt;strong&gt;Dangerous Aggression&lt;/strong&gt; gives them a free attack against the offender,
and if that hits the target is also immobilized (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tarek-earth-shaman&quot;&gt;Tarek Earth Shaman&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earth shamans are Level 4 Controllers with the Leader tag. They fight much like
Earthbenders from the Avatar shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their melee attacks use &lt;strong&gt;Fists of Stone&lt;/strong&gt; which target Fortitude, damage on a
hit and slide 3 squares as an effect. They can also use a spell named
&lt;strong&gt;Clutching Stone&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 3 vs. Fort, recharge 5+) that does the same
damage, knocks targets prone, and restrains them (save ends). And their ultimate
technique is &lt;strong&gt;Tide of Stone&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Ref, recharges when first
bloodied), which deals heavy damage and knocks prone on a hit. Allies caught in
the blast can instead shift 3 squares as an effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tareks will only buddy up with other tareks and whatever domesticated beasts
they might train. You will only find them in Mixed Groups of People if they’re
enslaved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen above, they like to stick close to each other in fights, and the book
also mentions they like the same focused fire tactics that tend to be described
as optimal for PCs. In other words, if they can they’ll pick a particularly
vulnerable target and focus their attacks there until the target is dead before
moving on to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
