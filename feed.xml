  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned the Netherese several times already, and now it’s time to view
the theme most directly connected to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we know that there was this ancient human empire named Netheril, that
it was ruled by archmages, and that it really liked building flying islands. We
also know that it fell overnight due to Shenanigans that caused its signature
magic to stop working and caused all of those islands to fall from the sky. And
we’ve also seen (spoilers!) that one of these islands fell on the Neverwinter
Wood. This island is named Xinlenal and it happens to be the first one ever
built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I think that either in the 4e FR book or somewhere near the end of third
edition, you had this metaplot event where the survivors of ancient Netheril
started coming back. Turns out another one of their island cities survived the
fall by crossing over into the Shadowfell, much like the eladrin did with the
Feywild. They spent all this time there, and were mutated by the plane’s
energies. Now they’re returning to the world bent on ruling it again, and are
engaged in sinister conspiracies the world over. These people consider
themselves heirs to Netheril and call themselves Shadovar. They’re fascists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sure enough, there are Shadovar in the Neverwinter Wood, trying to repair
Xinlenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a PC with this theme, you used to be one of them. Your early education
contained a lot of fascist drivel about how the Netherese were superior to all
other peoples of the world, and how they were going to reclaim their rightful
place at the top of the societal food chain once they returned. You were
assigned a post in the first scouting expeditions into the world, and fell in
love with all the warmth and sunlight you saw there. You also interacted with
plenty of supposedly “inferior” people that quickly dispelled the bullshit put
into your head by the Shadovar leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You volunteered for a post at the location farthest from the center of Shadovar
power - Neverwinter. You managed to vanish shortly after arriving here, and now
live in the city, keeping your past a secret. But lately you’ve been seeing
signs and hearing rumors that tell you the Shadovar presence here is
increasing. The only thing that would get them this riled up is a repairable
flying city. If there really is one here (spoiler: there is) and they manage to
make it fly, then this could become a new major center for the Shadovar, and
you’d never escape them again. You need to stop them, if only to ensure you can
live a peaceful life here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no class restrictions for this theme, but Scions of Shadow can only be
one of human, shadar-kai, or shade. Those last two represent whose bloodlines
were affected by the Shadowfell, or who were mutated directly. I think
Shadar-kai get a full playable treatment in the Gloomwrougth supplement, and
Shades appear in Heroes of Shadow. Even if you’re human, you’re still edgier
than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The associated background skills are Arcana, Bluff, and Stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features here are all about your heritage brings you closer to the shadows,
even though you have chosen the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 1 you gain &lt;strong&gt;Eyes of Night&lt;/strong&gt;. This daily power gives you Blindsight 10
for a turn when used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5, your healing surge value increases by 4 wherever you’re in dim light
or darkness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 10, you gain a +2 power bonus to Bluff and Stealth checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;utility-powers&quot;&gt;Utility Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More shadow magic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flitting Shadow&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 2 encounter power that can be used when you
reappear at the end of a teleport. The power makes you assume a shadow form for
a turn. This gives you Insubstantial, Phasing and Vulnerable 5 Radiant, and lets
you make checks to hide when you have partial cover or concealment from any
source, including from standing behind your allies. Shadar-kai get a teleport
encounter power, and classes like warlocks and swordmages can often teleport as
well. If you can’t teleport easily, this is worthless to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binding Shade&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 6 encounter power that can be used after you hit
with an attack. After the attack is fully resolved, you gain partial concealment
and combat advantage against its target until the end of your next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dancing Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 10 daily power that lets you teleport 6 squares
when used. Until the end of the encounter, you can teleport 3 squares at will
with a move action. In all cases, you must appear in a square of dim light or
darkness. This also makes that level 2 power look a lot more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impression&quot;&gt;Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very edgy. The Level 5 feature and Level 10 power are awesome in a party that
doesn’t need bright light to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shadovar/Netherese are a little less horrible than the Red Wizards, but only
a little. I wonder if you can capture their restored flying island and use it to
fight the finished Thayan fortress in a giant &lt;del&gt;robot&lt;/del&gt; magical structure battle.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Renegade Red Wizard</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thay is an island nation located somewhere outside of our regional map. It’s
ruled by wizards who like to wear red.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you’re only familiar with them from the Neverwinter Nights games, like I
am, you might have a somewhat ambiguous view of them. Sure, sometimes a Red
Wizard of Thay will be involved in evil schemes elsewhere in the world, but
#NotAllRedWizards are evil. There’s even a Lawful Neutral companion in NWN2: Mask
of the Betrayer who will praise the orderliness of her nation while helping you
save the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m here to tell you that this view is wrong. The Red Wizards of Thay are
basically Nazis. Their mechanical “thing” in 3e was that they overspecialized in
a single school of magic, but the edition change made the mask fall all the way
off and now nearly all of them pick Necromancy as their special school. So
they’re &lt;em&gt;necromantic&lt;/em&gt; Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thayan society values magic power above all else, so the Red Wizards are at the
top. The use of undead labor is widespread. Their rulers are a council of liches
led by one Szass Tam, one of those annoying epic villains the Forgotten Realms
are famous for. Most of the population thinks this state of things is
natural. Dissidents get zombified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a PC with the Renegade Red Wizard theme, you too grew up thinking all
of this was normal. You were pretty happy when your aptitude for magic was
discovered and you were admitted into one of the island’s prestigious Red Wizard
academies. You remained happy right up until your best friend made a tiny
mistake during a ritual, and your teacher was so enraged that he killed your
friend on the spot. Then he had the body brought in to be reanimated by your
class as a group project. You were completely horrified, but you looked around
you and saw that everyone else &lt;em&gt;still thought all of this was normal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You ran away the first chance you got, as fast as your feet could carry you, and
went as far as Neverwinter before you stopped and took stock of your
situation. You decided to stick around and help the reconstruction of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you discovered the Thayans were &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;, doing something unspeakably
evil somewhere in the Neverwinter Wood. You’re done running. Time to do
something about these dang wizard Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theme has no ancestry restriction, but its features only make sense for the
Essentials Wizard (also known as the Mage). The associated background skills are
Bluff, Heal, Religion, and Stealth. That seems like a lot, but it’s still
balanced because you still only get to pick one of them to boost or add to your
class list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theme has no optional powers, but it makes up for that with extra
features. To understand how they work we must first know a bit about the
Essentials Wizard (known as the Mage from here on out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mages specialize in specific schools of magic as they level up. Heroes of
the Fallen Lands has three of them: Enchantment, Illusion and Evocation. Each
has an Apprentice, Expert, and Master feature, and a set of paragon-tier powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At levels 1 and 4 the mage chooses an Apprentice feature for two different
schools (one at each of those levels). At levels 5 and 8, they gain Expert
features for these same schools. At level 10, they gain the Master feature for a
single school and go on to pick paragon-tier powers for that same school as they
level up even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In olden times, Red Wizards were known for specializing in a single school to a
greater degree than most others. Nowadays, they always pick “necromancy”, but
the Renegade PC has used their basic teachings to pick something else. So one of
their magic schools is Enchantment, Illusion or Invocation like a normal mage,
but the other is replaced by the extra features of this theme. The other
features usually relate to your experience hiding from and fighting your former
compatriots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from level 1, every time you attack from hiding with an arcane power
and miss every target, you remain hidden. Enemies can still try to make
Perception checks to find you, but you’re no longer automatically revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 4, you don’t get to make a second Apprentice choice. Instead, when one
of your spells causes a save-ends effect, the target has a -2 penalty on those
saves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5, you can switch one of your prepared spells at the end of a short
rest once per day, as long as its from your specialist school. Usually Mages can
switch spells only at the end of a long rest. Spell-switching is less of an
issue in 4e than it was earlier, in my experience, so this isn’t a very large
benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 8, you don’t get your second Expert choice. Instead you gain a +2
bonus to Bluff and Intimidate. The bonus is untyped, which is the least they
could to do compensate for the lack of another Expert magic feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 10, you gain an extra +1 (untyped!) bonus to attack any Red Wizard or
undead creature that grants combat advantage to you. As a ranged controller, you
can’t get combat advantage quite as easily as a melee striker, but this is still
pretty nice. Several of your spells should inflict conditions that make enemies
grant CA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all these features, I think the level 4 one is the best. Since wizards
are controllers, a very large number of their powers are of the save-ends type,
so a -2 penalty to all enemy saves is huge. The attack bonus against all undead
is also pretty cool, but it comes in very late in the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a non-Mage picked this theme, I’d rejigger is so they still get the Level 1
and 10 features as written, but get the printed Level 4 feature at level 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, about the story: As I mentioned previously, the Red Wizards are responsible
for the volcanic eruption that half-destroyed Neverwinter. Their original
intention was to &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; destroy it and use the deaths to power the Super
Necromantic Fortress they were building in the Neverwinter Wood. A band of novel
protagonists foiled them 30 years ago, but now they have returned to the site of
the incomplete fortress to try and finish the process. This is what the Renegade
has found clues about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I would be inclined to include an NPC Renegade if the party has none,
just so they can point the PCs towards the Red Wizards. Punching them would as
satisfying as punching Hellknights and Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Nevertwinter: Heir of Delzoun</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-neverwinter-delzoun-heir.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delzoun was the ancient dwarven empire that flourished at around the same time
as the other ancient empires of the region. Being underground, it managed to
survive the fall of Netheril relatively unscathed and last a few more centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had several underground cities in the area, but their grand capital of
Gauntlgrym was the most majestic and famous. It started out as a mining
complex. Eventually its workers Delved Too Greedily and Too Deep, and found a
slumbering primordial: Maegera the Inferno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luck was on the dwarves’ side, and they managed to avoid waking Maegera up. Some
time later, Delzoun’s leadership would make a deal with the archmage who ruled
over the city of Illusk, founded by Netheril survivors. Combining their
technical and magical expertise, they built a geothermal power generator around
Maegera’s prison, using her as the heat source. This brought both civilizations
great prosperity, for a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Illusk was razed and Gauntlgrym suffered the fate of all dwarven
fortresses, falling to an orcish invasion. Over the following years the orcs
would be displaced by humans, the humans by mind flayers, and then the city
would fall out of history and into myth. Today, Gauntlgrym is seen like a sort
of dwarven Atlantis - no dwarf alive knows where it was located, but many dream
of finding it and unearthing its riches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, though, an incredible event happened: a number of dwarves
throughout the world started receiving visitations from ghosts clad in the
ancient garb of Delzoun. The ghosts warned these distant descendants of theirs
that a great and terrible beast (spoiler: it’s Maegera) was about to awaken in
the site of ancient Gauntlgrym, and that this must not be allowed to pass. They
plead with these descendants to find the city and prevent the awakening. This
provoked a sort of “gold rush” to find the city, which died down after a few
more years of no one finding it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PC is one of the dwarves visited by the ghost of their ancestor, one who
hasn’t given up the search. They dream of finding their city, reclaiming their
ancient birthright, and elevating their family name to its rightful place among
their people’s legends. Oh, and of preventing the world-ending disaster that
would happen if this mysterious beast awakens. Strike the Earth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no class prerequisites here, but as a true heir of Delzoun the PC must
be a dwarf. The associated background skills are Dungeoneering and History.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These generally make you dwarfier than your typical dwarf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your starting feature makes you even more resistant to poison, granting you (5 +
half level) poison resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5, you gain an extra healing surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 10, you gain a +4 bonus to Diplomacy, Bluff and Intimidate when
interacting with other dwarves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optional-powers&quot;&gt;Optional Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These continue the theme of the features, making you tougher or more skilled in
dwarven lore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scholar of Ancient Ways&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 2 encounter power that lets you roll a
History check in place of any other INT-based skill check, or a Dungeoneering
check in place of any other WIS-based skill check. Because all things are like
dwarf fortresses if you look at them the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noble Indomitability&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 6 encounter power that works as an
interrupt. When you’re subject to forced movement, you can use it to spend a
healing surge and completely negate that movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body Over Mind&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 10 encounter power that can be used when you fail
a saving throw. It lets you spend a healing surge to succeed at that throw
instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These powers and features are excellent for all types of defenders, but they can
help a dwarf of any class become even more survivable. I know this is one of the
themes that locks you into a single ancestry, but it would be quite funny to
have a non-dwarf PC who is a true heir because they were adopted into a dwarven
family that can trace their line to Delzoun. If I was trying to make Carrot
Ironfoundersson as a 4e PC, I’d give him this theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story-wise, this is probably the best way to involve your party in the search
for Gauntlgrym. It’s easy to justify multiple PCs having it, and you could build
a campaign around an all-Heir party.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Pack Outcast</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-neverwinter-pack-outcast.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the other half of the barbarian plotline!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gray Wolf are another Uthgardt tribe. They share a lot of the same base
culture, but also have several important differences. Namely, they’re
werewolves! The condition has been with them since they were Netherese refugees,
and by now it’s quite well-integrated into their culture. Until very recently,
they behaved like your typical Uthgardt tribe: violent, yes, but turning that
capacity for violence only towards those who invaded their territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This changed with the latest generation of leaders, which have been taking the
tribe in a more aggressive direction. They’ve become raiders, killing for
material gain and sometimes even for sport. This got worse when a bunch of
mysterious shadow-people approached those leaders and filled their heads with
dreams of glory and of becoming part of a reborn ancient empire. The Grey Wolf
have stopped fighting for themselves and have begun fighting for lost
Netheril. They’ve kind of become a neo-fascist gang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PC with this theme is a member of the Grey Wolves who took a stand against
this early in the process, and was exiled. Rumors have reached them that the
leaders of the Grey Wolves have switched to executing dissidents, and this has
driven the PC to act. Their goal is now to drive the shadows of Netheril from
the region and cleanse the tribe of their influence, getting them back on the
right track. They see the other PCs as a “temporary pack” that will help them
achieve this goal. Lone wolves are a myth, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pack Outcast can belong to any class. The Gray Wolves also dislike arcane
magic, but there was no one around to prevent the outcast from learning it if
they so choose. Still, melee weapon users are going to benefit much more from
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Grey Wolves are either humans or shifters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re a werewolf!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 1, you gain &lt;strong&gt;Body of the Wolf&lt;/strong&gt;. This is an at-will power that lets
you turn into a wolf (or back) with a minor action. When you transform, you can
also shift 1 square. The character retains their stats, and gains a +1 bonus to
Speed. All equipment melds into their form and provides its passive benefits
(unless it’s a shield). The character can’t use item powers or access
containers, but gains a wolf bite attack and becomes proficient with it. This
counts as a melee weapon with a +3 proficiency bonus, 1d8 base damage, and the
same magical enhancement as the character’s primary weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bite is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better than the one the Dead Rat Deserter gets at level 10!
Its main advantage is counting as a magical melee weapon instead of being a
specific power. This lets the PC use any of their weapon powers while in wolf
form, meaning anyone that relies on this type of power benefits from it. This
means all melee martials both from the PHBs and from Essentials material, as
well as characters like wardens, barbarians, paladins, and even the Warpriest
(Essentials cleric).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bite is still useless for characters who rely on implements, and the book
doesn’t say anything specific about whether implements work while melded to the
animal form. A generous GM might interpret “You continue to gain the benefits of
the equipment you wear” to say that they do work, giving you a spellcasting
wolf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting at level 5, enemies adjacent to you grant combat advantage to you and
to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; allies who are also adjacent to those enemies. You don’t need to be in
a flanking position, any adjacent space will do. Also, you get CA even if you’re
the only PC adjacent to the enemy. This is super useful for melee combatants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 10, you gain a +2 power bonus to Athletics and Intimidate, which is
kinda underwhelming after the two other skills but can still be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optional-powers&quot;&gt;Optional Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get even more werewolf-y!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bite of the Wolf&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 2 encounter power that can be used when you hit
an enemy that grants combat advantage to you with a melee attack. This knocks
the enemy prone. Despite the name, you don’t need to be in wolf form to use
it. And remember that after level 5 every adjacent enemy will grant you CA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood of the Wolf&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 6 daily power that can be activated with a
minor action and gives you regeneration equal to (1 + CON Mod) while you’re
bloodied. Like a werewolf’s regeneration, it shuts down for a turn if you’re
damaged by silver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soul of the Wolf&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 10 daily power that lets you assume a hybrid
form. You retain all of your equipment, armor and weapons, and can use them
normally. You also gain the same bite attack as in the level 1 power, temporary
HP equal to (10 + CON Mod), and a +2 power bonus to Speed, Fortitude, Athletics,
Intimidate, and damage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s a Dead Rat Deserter in the party, they’re going to spend most of
their time looking with envy at the Pack Outcast. This is a theme that greatly
boosts melee weapon users and has a spectacular level 10 power. Even if such a
character already has something equivalent to one of its features and powers,
they’re unlikely to have all of them, so there’s something here for
everyone. Plus, you get to say you’re a werewolf!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pack Outcast and the Uthgardt Barbarian are going to get along like a house
on fire, and having both in the same party will let you “speedrun” the first
couple of milestones of the barbarian investigation plotline. And just like that
other theme, this one can also be used for multiple PCs without any convoluted
explanations. An all-Pack Outcast game is a Werewolf: The Forsaken campaign
using 4e rules.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Uthgardt Barbarian</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uthgardt are the barbarians of this Frozen North, more Conan-like than
Viking-like. They’re one of the many people descended from the citizens of the
human empire of Netheril, which scattered in a lot of different directions when
that empire fell overnight. The ancestors of the Uthgardt stayed in the region
when one of the Netherese flying islands fell here, and learned how to live off
the land. They take their name from Uthgar, a mythical ancestor who was so
badass he ascended to godhood and became one of the exarchs of Tempus, the FR
god of war. There are many Uthgardt tribes today, each one named after a
different kind of animal they admire and try to emulate. All of them venerate
Uthgar along with a series of tribe-specific primal spirits, and don’t pay much
attention to other gods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PC with this background belongs to the Thunderbeast tribe, who lives in the
High Forest way to the east of our regional map. A bit before the campaign
started, the tribe engaged in their annual custom of the Runemeet, when all of
them travel to their ancestral holy site to worship the spirits and perform
several important rites. The Thunderbeast’s site is a burial mound in
Neverwinter Wood, the resting place of one of Uthgar’s companions. The skeleton
of a great thunderbeast (which I guess is a type of dinosaur?) rests atop this
mound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or at least it used to. This year, the tribe found the mound dug up - whoever
did it carted off both the skeleton and the contents of the tomb beneath. The PC
was supposed to perform a sacred hunt as their coming-of-age ceremony, but the
elders decide to change their plans and charge the PC with a different quest:
find out who did this, make them pay, and restore the mound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tribe returns home, but the PC stays to await the return of the Grey Wolf
tribe, who lives nearby and who left for their own Runemeet elsewhere. They
should know who the desecrators are… and if it turns out &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are the
desecrators, then the PC has another target for their hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uthgardt disdain arcane magic, so most Uthgardt PCs will belong to martial,
divine, or primal classes. Still, there are no hard restrictions and you could
be a secret arcanist if you want added complications. The same goes for
characters who worship anyone other than Uthgar and the primal spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Thunderbeast Uthgardt are all human, and you need a good reason to be
something else (i.e, you or one of your parents was adopted into the tribe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Level 1, they gain the &lt;strong&gt;Thunderbeast Stomp&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power. Stomping is a
minor action, and the resulting shockwaves act as an aura (2) that prevents
enemies inside from making opportunity attacks. It lasts for a turn, which is
enough to let the character run right past a defender line and charge the enemy
squishies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5, the PC gains a +4 to Perception checks made to find tracks, and a +4
to Insight when dealing with beasts and other Uthgardt. The bonuses are
specific, but also untyped, which is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 10, the character’s reputation as a barbarian hero gives them a +3
power bonus to Intimidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;utility-powers&quot;&gt;Utility Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These powers center on communion with primal spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spiritual Guidance&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 2 daily power that lets the PC reroll a
Nature, Religion, or History check they dislike with a +5 bonus. The spirits of
the ancestors chime in to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength of the Beast&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 6 daily power that gives the PC a +4 power
bonus to Athletics and Strength checks until the end of the encounter. Good for
skill challenges or feats of strength during combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit Swarm&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 10 power that directly summons the PC’s ancestor
spirits to help in combat. This minor action creates a zone in a Close
Burst 2. Enemies inside the zone cannot regain HP or gain temporary HP. Allies
who enter or end their turns in the zone gain 5 temporary HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theme can make characters of any class feel like Barbarians, and any actual
Barbarians will be Barbarier-than-thou. There’s little to aid in combat here,
but the skill bonuses will go a long way in the appropriate campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the typical Uthgardt has a hard time relating peacefully to people
outside their culture, so a PC in a mixed party is a somewhat atypical
individual by definition. Multiple PCs could easily take it in the same party
with the simple explanation that the tribe left behind a team instead of an
individual. A party where everyone has this theme would be extremely
uninterested in the fate of Neverwinter, and would single-mindedly pursue their
quest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Iliyanbruen Guardian</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-neverwinter-eladrin-guardian.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so back in Olden Times there was an elven empire named Illefarn that
reached as far as the North. Over the course of history this empire broke up
into three successor states. The one that covered our current region of interest
was named Iliyanbruen. This is important because if you get the two confused the
surviving eladrin of Iliyanbruen will tut-tut at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, when Netheril’s magic winked out, one of their floating islands fell on
the Neverwinter Wood. This was a disaster for both the humans living on the
island and the nation of Iliyanbruen that happened to be beneath it. Many of its
inhabitants decided to call it quits and move to Evermeet, which means more or
less leaving the world behind for good. Others decided to try and preserve their
culture, and enacted a ritual to move their capital city of Shandarar to the
Feywild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their new home was anything but safe, though, as a lot of the same beings who
had driven the original elves away from the Feywild at the dawn of time were
still there and they didn’t like the arrival of these invaders one bit. After a
period of strife, though, the elves managed to re-establish their nation there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iliyanbruen still exists in the modern day, its borders a ways away from the
place where Shandarar used to be. With the coming of the Spellplague, the world
and the Feywild began to enter in conjunction, which made the crossing once
again possible. After a lengthy battle to drive a covey of hags away from
Shandarar, the eladrin managed to send scouts and explorers though to the
world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I don’t know if the people of Iliyanbruen became eladrin after
millennia of living in the Feywild or if they were already a type of elf that
got recast as eladrin when the editions changed. We’ll be looking into some of
those later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, upon arriving at the world, the eladrin of Iliyanbruen were horrified to
learn the old ruins of their empire were not only in a state of disrepair but
had also been looted and plundered. They were quite mad about it. You leave your
stuff lying around for a mere three thousand years and these uppity mortals
think they can come and take it. What an outrage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eladrin of New Shandarar began debating what to do and soon fell into two
distinct camps. One faction wants to invade the world in force and rain
vengeance upon anyone who lingers near the ruins of Iliyanbruen (i.e, everyone
in our regional map). The other also wants to restore the old cities to their
glory, but only wants to take revenge on the people directly responsible for the
thefts. This does require learning who these people are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PC is one of the investigators responsible for finding this out. They helped
retake Sharandar from the hags, were among the first to arrive on the world, and
decided to make it their home as they try to reconstruct the history of the
ruins and find the thieves. They belong to the moderate faction, and as the
campaign starts they’re getting desperate for results because the firebrands
back home are about to win the debate. They need concrete results, and fast, if
the world is to avoid an eladrin invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even worse, the main obstacle to their investigation isn’t the ludicrously large
time scale. No, it seems there’s someone out there actively trying to prevent
eladrin investigators from finding anything out, usually by murdering them. It’s
dangerous to go alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theme is open to eladrin PCs of any class. Not all inhabitants of modern
Iliyanbruen are eladrin, but all of the features and powers here are aimed at
powering up their Fey Step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 1, PC can take one adjacent ally with them when they use Fey Step. The
ally also appears adjacent to the PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5, they gain a +2 power bonus to History and Nature checks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 10, they can use Fey Step as a minor action instead of a move
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optional-powers&quot;&gt;Optional Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these are yet more teleport-related power-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blink Away&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 2 encounter power that lets the PC teleport 2 squares
as a reaction to an enemy ending their turn adjacent to the PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evasive Step&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 6 daily power that lets then use Fey Step as an
interrupt if an enemy attacks them while Fey Step is unexpended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feywild Will&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 10 daily power that gives the PC a +2 power bonus to
Will and to saving throws until the end of the encounter. Whenever the PC
succeeds at a save while this is active, they gain 5 + WIS Modifier temporary
HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peeking ahead a bit I see Forgotten Realms’ Moon and Sun elves are eladrin
variants in 4e. I remember they were both huge assholes, so it’s not a surprise
the eladrin of Iliyanbruen are just as unpleasant even if they’re only their
distant relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most other PCs would be very interested in preventing an invasion from
Iliyanbruen from adding to their troubles, so they’re natural allies of the
moderate Guardian. And this is another one of those themes that easily supports
multiple PCs, or even a whole mono-theme party (it’s a &lt;em&gt;team&lt;/em&gt; of
investigators). Such a party would be mostly uninterested in Neverwinter’s
political woes, except where they intersect with their quest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to optimize for the ability to do Teleport Shenanigans, this is the
theme for you. Little could stop a whole party of them from getting to where
they want to go. For other campaigns, it would also be relatively easy to strip
the standard Iliyanbruen backstory and just say a PC with this theme is a native
of the Feywild who moved to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Dead Rat Deserter</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-neverwinter-dead-rat-deserter.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luskan is a coastal city a ways north of Neverwinter. In the games, it was a
pirate and thief-infested cesspool secretly ruled by a cabal of evil
wizards. The evil wizards were defeated in a novel before the start of the
events in this book, so now it’s just exactly what it always appeared to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dead Rats are currently the most successful thieves’ guild in Luskan. They
have this name because their senior members are wererats, and their initiation
ceremony involves a ritual that imparts some wererat powers to the
initiate. Their leader is a halfling bard named Toytere, also known as “King
Toy”, who seems to have the power to see the future and uses it to foil the many
assassination attempts made on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PC with this background used to be an average member of the Rats until they
were brought in before King Toy, who proclaimed the PC was destined to lead a
mutiny against him and ordered their execution. This was news to the PC, who
barely made it out of the room alive and managed to abscond to Neverwinter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their original goal here was to build enough wealth and power to return to
Luskan and take revenge on those who wronged them, but this might have changed
by the time the campaign starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dead Rat Deserter PCs are usually shifty and shady types, though they’re loyal
to their friends (who include the other PCs). While rogues are the first to come
to mind, there aren’t any class restrictions. Characters should be either
humans, half-elves, or halflings, since those are the majority ancestries in
Luskan and make up all of the Dead Rat membership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The background skills for this theme are Intimidate, Stealth, and Thievery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a theme just to make a shifty character with a shady criminal
past, so why choose this one? Because it also lets you be a &lt;em&gt;wererat&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level 1 feature is &lt;strong&gt;Body of the Rat&lt;/strong&gt;, an 1/round minor-action at-will
power that lets the PC assume the form of a Tiny rat. The same power also lets
them change back, and whenever they change shape they can also shift 1
square. In rat form, the PC can’t attack but gains a climb speed equal to half
their ground speed and a +4 to Stealth checks. The PC’s equipment melds into the
rat form, and continues to provide all of its passive benefits. There are a few
exceptions: they don’t get AC bonuses from shields, can’t use active item
powers, and can’t access any containers (like bags or potion vials). On the
other hand, their equipment can’t be removed in any way while it’s part of the
rat form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5, the PC gains a +2 power bonus to Stealth and Bluff. This is useful
for a rogue-type, but would be much better if it was untyped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Level 10, &lt;strong&gt;Hybrid Bite&lt;/strong&gt; lets the PC assume the classic hybrid wererat
form. Changing back and forth is an at-will minor action, like above, and the
character retains all their equipment and can use it normally. The hybrid form
has the same size as the character. The character also gains a bite attack. The
attack bonus for this is (STR or DEX modifier)+4, and the damage is 1d8+(same
modifier) plus 5 ongoing damage (save ends). The bonus increases to +6 and the
damage to 2d8 at level 21.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This attack is a little underwhelming, I think. If Strength or Dexterity is your
main attack stat, it’s going to be about on par with a +2 weapon with a +2
proficiency bonus, which means it’s less accurate than the characters’s actual
main weapon if any of those stats are better on it. Ongoing damage on an at-will
is good, but also maybe not as good as the bonuses of a level 10’s character
main weapon and class powers. If you use anything other than STR or DEX to
attack, this power is useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;utility-powers&quot;&gt;Utility Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optional powers here are all about tapping into your inner rat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savage Hiss&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 2 encounter power that helps intimidate enemies in a
fight. When the PC scores a critical hit, they can use this power to inflict
every enemy within 5 squares with a -4 penalty to attack the PC for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead Rat Stealth&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 6 daily power that takes a minor action and
gives the PC a +2 power bonus to Stealth and Thievery for the rest of the
encounter. If the PC dislikes a roll for one of these skills, they can end the
effect and reroll it with a +5 power bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intuitive Leap&lt;/strong&gt; is a Level 10 daily power that represents the PC inheriting
some of King Toy’s prophetic abilities. The PC can use it when it’s time to roll
initiative, gaining a +4 power bonus to the roll and being able to stand up or
move their speed for free at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, this theme suits high-Dex characters the best, since it boosts
Stealth and Thievery and might let a character who lacks both to get access to
one of them. Being able to turn into a normal-looking rat can enable &lt;em&gt;all sorts&lt;/em&gt;
of shenanigans, especially out of combat, but the hybrid form and bite attack
are of dubious utility at best. This is not a theme that will do a lot to boost
your damage output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story-wise, I haven’t gotten far enough into the book to see whether Luskan and
the Rats influence Neverwinter in any significant way. It’s possible a Rat would
just be along for the ride if they’re the only one in the party. An &lt;em&gt;all-Rat&lt;/em&gt;
party would result in a significantly different path than those implied by the
other paths we saw so far. They all got set up together and would still retain
their goal of getting rich and powerful enough to return and get some revenge,
likely causing a lot of chaos in Neverwinter in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Harper Agent</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-neverwinter-harper.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I remember, the Harpers used to be a “good conspiracy” back the “old
days” of the Forgotten Realms. A secret society dedicated to doing good,
fighting for freedom, and keeping the many evil factions of the setting in
check. Elminster was a big fan, and several of the setting’s iconic NPCs were
members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those Harpers got destroyed during the Spellplague, but sixty years before our
narrative present a new group took up the name. This incarnation of the group is
mostly focused on stopping the machinations of those Netheril survivors who came
out of the Shadowfell, though they also have their fingers in other pies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PC with this background has a very specific and rather tense backstory. They
always dreamed of joining the Harpers, and traveled to Everlund to apply. They
were given a trial mission - to go to Neverwinter and link up with a woman named
Cymril. Cymril was not only a fully-fledged Harper Agent but also the leader of
the Sons of Alagondar. The Sons are a group of rebels who opposes Dagult
Neverember, and who fight for an independent Neverwinter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PC gets included in night-time recon mission led by Cymril herself, and
their group gets ambushed by a force of Neverember’s mercs. In panic, the PC
hides, and then gets to witness as the rebels are massacred. The thing is,
Cymril herself turned coat as soon as the fight started, and began killing her
own underlings! In the end, the hidden PC is the only survivor on the rebel
side: Cymril gets taken out by one of her lieutenants, who in turn dies to the
mercenaries. They leave the rebels’ bodies on the street as a warning. Our PC as
the foresight to steal Cymril’s Harper pin before absconding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the title of “Harper Agent” is kind of misleading. The PC is actually a
&lt;em&gt;rogue&lt;/em&gt; agent, sympathetic to the organization’s ideals but operating without
their official support. The PC can’t let it become known that they’re not a real
Harper, and even without that secret coming out they’re already facing suspicion
from the very rebel group they were supposed to help, for being the only
survivor of the ambush that killed Cymril.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A PC with this background wishes to discover the truth behind that massacre,
prove their innocence, and fulfill their original mission of preventing
Neverember from becoming the cutthroat merchant-king he wishes to be. This theme
brings even more intrigue and spy games into the game than the Neverwinter
Noble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no class or race prerequisites, though the book recommends Harper
characters be good at subterfuge and say many of them multiclass into bard,
rogue, ranger or wizard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This class gains only a single feature: that Harper Pin pried from Cymril’s
corpse. It marks the bearer as a member of the Harpers, brings with it a
blessing from one of their patron goddesses, and can be used as a key to secret
Harper hideouts and caches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, it’s a Rare Level 3 Wondrous Item, which means it doesn’t take up
any slots and can’t be bought in stores. The PC chooses one of three possible
blessings at character creation, and this becomes the pin’s item encounter
power. &lt;strong&gt;Llira’s Grace&lt;/strong&gt; lets them roll 1d6 and add it to an attack roll they
just missed, potentially turning it into a hit. &lt;strong&gt;Mielikki’s Endurance&lt;/strong&gt; lets
them reduce incoming damage from an attack by 5 + half level. And &lt;strong&gt;Tymora’s
Luck&lt;/strong&gt; lets them re-roll a save with a +2 bonus to the new roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;utility-powers&quot;&gt;Utility Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This class’s optional utility powers continue to follow the themes of the divine
blessings above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harper’s Healing Boon&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 2 daily power that can be used as an
interrupt when the PC is hit by an attack. They take only half damage from the
attack and can immediately roll a save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Ally&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 6 power that represents the PC use fast-talk to
trick an enemy into believing the PC is a secret ally of theirs. This means the
enemy can’t make opportunity attacks against the PC and grants combat advantage
to them. The effect ends when the PC attacks the fooled enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resourceful Dastard&lt;/strong&gt; (yes, with a D) is a level 10 daily power. It’s a stance
that gives +4 to all defenses when the PC has cover or concealment, and lets
them ignore all difficult terrain when shifting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theme is very strongly oriented towards rogue, bard, or even ranger PCs, I
feel. Its blessing and utility power can help make these characters less fragile
and more mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A criticism I’d make is that this one is a lot less generic than the other
themes we saw so far. With a background like that, it’s a bit hard to make the
PC anything other than a rogue Harper in the Neverwinter region of the Forgotten
Realms. It’s also almost impossible to have more than one Harper Agent in a
party unless you change that very detailed background and come up with another
reason why they can’t contact out-of-town Harpers for support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Harper Agent in a party has reasons to cozy up to and aid the Neverwinter
Noble, and provides a good hook for the GM to introduce the group to the Sons of
Alagondar (or what’s left of them). Cooperation would not be automatic, since
the Sons distrust the Harper, but it would be a start. The Agent would also try
to convince any other neutral PCs to oppose Neverember.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Oghma's Faithful</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oghma is the Forgotten Realms god of knowledge and thought, occupying the
roughly the same position as Ioun does in the default 4e setting. This
particular PC is one of his worshipers, and for a while now they’ve been
receiving dreams and visions from the god. These start as nightmares, but soon
the threats are burned away by divine fire and the dreamer finds themselves in a
grand hall where the sound of a water clock can be heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meaning of these visions is clear: the faithful must go to Neverwinter and
restore the House of Knowledge, a big temple to Oghma that was destroyed in the
eruption. Neverwinter used to produce famously accurate water clocks, you
see. This, and many of the city’s other lost craft secrets, could be restored
from the temple’s archive, if it still survives. This would help the city’s
reconstruction immensely, and of course bring the worship of Oghma back to the
region in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about as lofty a goal as that of the Noble, though it’s much less
concerned with secular politics. The Faithful is still going to need allies, and
so has a ready-made reason to work together with any other PCs interested in
restoring the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oghma’s Faithful can belong to any race or class. Though the book says the theme
fits divine characters better, the actual powers printed here surprisingly good
for skill-monkeys from all power sources. Essentials Clerics can also pick up an
Oghma domain, shown later. The theme’s background skills are History, Religion,
and Streetwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 1, the Faithful gains the &lt;strong&gt;Understand Language&lt;/strong&gt; power, an encounter
power that lets the PC choose a language they’ve heard or seen in the last 24
hours and become able to understand it until the end of the encounter. Outside
of combat, that would be about 5 minutes, but as this is an encounter power you
might as well consider the PC constantly able to understand that language during
extended exploration sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5 the PC gains another power, &lt;strong&gt;Sudden Insight&lt;/strong&gt;, which once per
encounter lets them re-roll a skill check and take the second result. This is
any skill, not just knowledge ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 10, they gain a +4 bonus to Perception checks made “to search”, which I
guess means to actively search for something (such as traps, treasure, or the
right book in the temple’s archive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;utility-powers&quot;&gt;Utility Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, these become additional options when it’s time for the PC to choose
utility powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learned Response&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 2 daily power that lets the PC use the result of
an Insight check as their initiative for that combat. Even to me this feels a
little too narrow in scope, but it does mean the low-Dex cleric will act much
earlier once per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Idea&lt;/strong&gt; is a Level 6 encounter power which can be used as an interrupt when
an adjacent creature attacks the PC. The PC slides the attacker 2 squares to
another adjacent space, and inflicts a -2 penalty to its attacks and saves for a
turn. Good for melee skirmisher-types like rogues or avengers. Clerics probably
have something better to choose here from their class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical Inspiration&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 10 encounter power that lets the PC shift 3
squares to be adjacent to an enemy as a move action, and also allow an ally
within 5 squares to shift 3 squares for free. I could see a warlord or rogue
taking this too, to help gain combat advantage earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feels less spectacular to me than the Neverwinter Noble theme, as I’m not
very enthusiastic about the FR pantheon. Mechanics-wise, it’s mostly about
improving your skill checks, which can be awesome in the sort of campaign
suggested by this book where you can have plenty of non-combat investigative and
intrigue scenarios. It’s probably not going to do much for your combat
effectiveness, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple PCs with this background are very easy to accommodate in the same
party, as they would all share a common cause and would have every reason to
work together.&lt;/p&gt;

    See? It's quite easy.

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Neverwinter Noble</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that Neverwinter is on the way to being restored, Lord Dagult Neverember of
Waterdeep has arrived to take control. He claims to be a distant relation of the
old rulers of Neverwinter, and has declared himself Lord Protector of the city
until “order is fully restored”. He’s backed by an army of mercenaries, and
everyone expects him to crown himself king once he stamps out resistance to his
rule and controls the whole city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people suspect his claim to the throne is a lie. You are completely
sure it’s bunk, because &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; are the true heir to the throne of
Neverwinter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are the child of a noblewoman who escaped the city as it was being
destroyed, shortly before you were born. She would succumb to her wounds and her
grief shortly after having you, and you would be adopted by the Thann noble
house in Waterdeep. You were given a proper noble education and consumed a
steady diet of heroic poems and epics. They told you about your true heritage
shortly after Dagult took over Neverwinter, and by the time the campaign starts
you have decided to seek your birthright there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a lofty goal, and a difficult one: you need strong allies, and the sort
of conclusive evidence for your claim that can only be found in the ruins of the
city. It’s up to you whether the other PCs know of your heritage or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neverwinter Nobles must be at least &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; human, because the historical lords
of the city were human. The powers suit melee defenders and give them a leaderly
bent, but there are no hard class prerequisites. The background skills are
Diplomacy and History.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level 1 feature is an extra encounter power named &lt;strong&gt;Take Heart, Friend!&lt;/strong&gt;,
which lets you use your lordly charisma to rally a comrade. It’s a minor-action
encounter power that gives an ally within 5 squares a +2 power bonus to all
defenses and 5/tier temporary HP. The “5/tier” bit means it would remain useful
even after the projected level range for this campaign, which is a nice touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The level 5 and 10 features are less flashy, which follows the usual design
formula for themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 5, when you flank an enemy your allies gain a +1 power bonus to attack
that enemy. This does stack with the usual +2 bonus from combat advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At level 10, you are probably close to claiming the throne and your regal mien
is obvious for any to see. You gain a +4 bonus to Diplomacy when interacting
with citizens of Neverwinter, and a +4 bonus to Intimidate against anyone who
opposes your rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;utility-powers&quot;&gt;Utility Powers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not mandatory, as I’ve said earlier. Rather, they become additional
choices alongside class powers whenever the PC would gain an utility power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honorable Challenge&lt;/strong&gt; is a Level 2 encounter power that requires a minor
action. It gives you an aura 2 that lasts a turn. Enemies inside take a -2
penalty to attack anyone other than you. In other words, it’s a wider Defender’s
Aura that lasts for a single round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cover Your Ally&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 6 encounter power. When an ally within 3 squares
of you is attacked, and you are not a target of the attack, you can swap places
with your ally as an interrupt, and become the new target of the
attack. Castling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pillar of Lordly Might&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 10 daily power. It’s a move action that
gives you a +2 to all defenses and a +5 to Diplomacy, but also immobilizes
you. This lasts for a turn but can be sustained with minor actions. Great for
all those Thou Shall Not Pass moments, and it might even allow you to negotiate
peace in the middle of a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly don’t have a lot of skill at gauging the effectiveness of PC powers
in 4e. These seem cool to me. They do work much better for melee defenders, and
here they work equally well for Essentials and PHB classes. I like it that none
of the powers involves attack rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the theme’s mechanical effectiveness, it gains major points for me
because you get to become the ruler of Neverwinter if you follow the built-in
story and succeed at it! Very few of the GMs I’ve known would just let a PC be
the True Heir to the Throne if they asked it. Here, it’s just a character option
anyone can take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, multiple characters in the party could take this theme. Perhaps the
mother had twins, or perhaps you had multiple nobles who fled to Waterdeep with
small or unborn children. This being 4e, I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; recommend using this as
an excuse for deadly intra-party conflict. After all, Dagult Neverember is
already there to provide proper opposition to the PCs. Rather, players of
multiple nobles should probably agree on who has the actual claim to the throne
and who “merely” stands to inherit an estate and become a trusted advisor to the
monarch.&lt;/p&gt;
