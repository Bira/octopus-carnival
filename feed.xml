&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuan-ti have been in the game since AD&amp;amp;D 1st Edition. Here, they are both in the
Monster Manual and in the Vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuan-ti lore has gotten more and more elaborate since their first appearance,
and by Fourth Edition it’s quite something. The Monster Vault has a doozy of an
origin story for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when the world was young, and the gods were still creating the mortals that
would inhabit it, the snake god Zehir found out he couldn’t make his own
mortals. So, being sort of treacherous asshole you’d expect a D&amp;amp;D snake god to
be, he decided to steal some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, he seduced Avandra and tried to convince her to teach him how to
reshape mortals created by other gods. Being in love, Avandra accepted. Not
being a fool, she attached an extra condition to this power: Zehir could only
use it if the god that presided over the mortals in question gave him explicit
permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Zehir was a lot more of an asshole than Avandra suspected. When the
Dawn War was over, and the other gods were all weakened from all the fighting,
Zehir murdered the god of humanity. And now he had a whole mortal species to
mess with at will, no permission required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zehir took many humans and changed them into creatures whose shape pleased
him. These became the yuan-ti, his chosen people. They, in turn, built the
mighty empire of Zannad, which ruled over the whole world. From what I can piece
together from the other entries, the time of Zannad was after the fall of the
giants but before the rise of pretty much anyone else. Depending on how you
classify giants, you could even call Zannad the first mortal empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually the surviving gods regained their strength and slapped Zehir around
until he relinquished his control over humanity. Though they argued for a while
over who would take custody of their souls after this, they never managed to
come to an agreement. And this is why the humans of today have the potential to
be both the most virtuous and the most corrupt of mortals: by default, their
souls belong to no god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slavery was the foundation upon which Zannad was built, and it fell when its
innumerable slaves successfully rebelled against their masters. The yuan-ti of
today are descended from those who survived Zannad’s fall, and in their minds
there is no great aspiration than to rebuild their former empire in all its
cruel glory. The way the book describes it, they have a much better chance of
achieving this goal than the giants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout most of the world, the yuan-ti live in secret amid the other mortal
peoples and conspire to take over their power structures. They head secret cults
of Zehir and bestow minor reptilian transformations upon their human lackeys as
rewards for loyalty. These people are known as “snaketongue cultists”. Some get
inducted and transformed because they’re the sort of people who agrees perfectly
with Zehir’s philosophies. Others get kidnapped and transformed first, and then
convinced they must serve the god that “marked” them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuan-ti conspiracies are many and varied, and in a lot of places people don’t
even know they exist at all. In other places, they already got to the point
where they can rule openly, such as in Zahnshahan, the Slithering City. These
serpentine city-states engage in trade and diplomacy much like any other mortal
realm, but their ultimate goal is always the subjugation of their neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Yuan-ti are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Reptile keyword. They have
Resist Poison 10, and a natural speed of 7. All of their other abilities are the
product of training, so they vary a lot per stat block. These start at
mid-Paragon tier and go up from there, so by the time the PCs meet yuan-ti in
person they’ve likely worked their way through the bottom rungs of their
conspiracy pyramid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snaketongue cultists are Medium Natural Humanoids, more specifically
humans. Their minor mutations aren’t enough to give them the Reptile keyword or
any special powers beyond what they get from training. Like their masters they
rely both on their skill at arms and on any snake-and-poison-themed magic they
might have gained through arcane study or devotion to Zehir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cultists are more or less equivalent to the near-human “purebloods” of earlier
editions, and I guess that name was dropped because it was confusing (“why is
the least snaky variety named like that?”). 5e would adopt the name again and
make yuan-ti backstory even more elaborate in order to justify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Monster Vault mentions the existence of snaketongue cultists but doesn’t
have stat blocks for any, though of course any human stat block can be used with
a few tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-malison-sharp-eye-both&quot;&gt;Yuan-ti Malison Sharp-Eye (Both)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Malison” is what the most common variety of yuan-ti is called. They’re
pretty much your standard Serpent People. Some have legs, some have snake
bodies, but all are equally mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharp-eyes are Level 13 Artillery with 98 HP. They wield a &lt;strong&gt;scimitar&lt;/strong&gt; in melee
and a &lt;strong&gt;longbow&lt;/strong&gt; at range, and they ideally want to stay far away from the
opposition because their &lt;strong&gt;Chameleon Defense&lt;/strong&gt; gives them partial concealment
from enemies more than 3 squares away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrows from the longbow are envemomed - a hit with them triggers a secondary
attack vs. Fortitude, which does ongoing poison damage and dazes (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-malison-stalker-monster-vault&quot;&gt;Yuan-ti Malison Stalker (Monster Vault)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalkers are Level 13 Skirmishers with 126 HP. They wield &lt;strong&gt;morningstars&lt;/strong&gt; with
interesting riders: a hit prohobits the target from marking anyone for a turn,
and does ongoing poison damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also throw &lt;strong&gt;poisoned daggers&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 10 vs. AC) which do a bit less
physical damage but also have an ongoing poison damage rider (save ends). Their
at-will &lt;strong&gt;slither strike&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to end any mark currently on them, shift
4 squares and make a dagger or morningstar attack at any point along the
movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like stalkers are effective at shutting down a PC defender’s ability
to, well, defend. They can move past the party’s front-line and target the PCs
in the back, or flank said front-line to allow their own squishies to move away
unimpeded by marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-abomination-both&quot;&gt;Yuan-Ti Abomination (Both)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-yuan-ti-abomination.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2008 Wizards of the Coast
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Large yuan-ti warrior that seems to always have a snake’s lower
body. It’s a Level 14 Soldier with 140 HP who fights with a &lt;strong&gt;bastard sword&lt;/strong&gt;
and a shield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sword marks for a turn and does ongoing poison damage (save ends). The
abomination can use a minor action to grab a victim using its &lt;strong&gt;grasping coils&lt;/strong&gt;
(melee 2 vs. Reflex), and it can &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; a grabbed victim as its attack. This
does more damage than the sword, both immediate and ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-malison-chanter-monster-vault&quot;&gt;Yuan-Ti Malison Chanter (Monster Vault)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spellcaster is likely a priest of Zehir. It’s Level 15 Artillery with 118
HP. While bloodied, its &lt;strong&gt;Bloody Scales&lt;/strong&gt; trait grants it a +2 bonus to speed
and to all defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chanter fights in melee with a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; that also causes ongoing poison
damage (save ends), and at range with a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Warp&lt;/strong&gt; spell (ranged 20 vs. Will)
which does a bunch of psychic damage and inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks for a
turn. It can also use &lt;strong&gt;Poisoned Domination&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 20 vs. Will) against a
target taking ongoing poison damage, dominating it for a turn. This is an
encounter power that recharges when the chanter is bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If hit by a melee or ranged attack, the chanter can use &lt;strong&gt;Deflect Attack&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 4-6) to have it hit an adjacent ally instead. So make sure to surround
the chanter with lots of cultists!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-malison-incanter-monster-manual&quot;&gt;Yuan-Ti Malison Incanter (Monster Manual)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name hints, this is basically the same monster as the Chanter above, but
it’s stat block is different enough it warrants a separate entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Incanter has the same level, HP, and bite as its Vault counterpart, but all
the other abilities are different. It has a &lt;strong&gt;Zehir’s Shield&lt;/strong&gt; aura (10) that
gives all allies a +2 bonus to all defenses. &lt;strong&gt;Mind Warp&lt;/strong&gt; dazes (save ends)
instead of inflicting an attack penalty. &lt;strong&gt;Poisoned Domination&lt;/strong&gt; has a shorter
range (5) and has a daze (save ends) after-effect. Bloody Scales is replaced by
&lt;strong&gt;Slither Away&lt;/strong&gt;, which is similar but grants a +5 to all defenses instead of a
+2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a new attack too, &lt;strong&gt;Zehir’s Venom&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10 vs. Fortitude; recharge
4-6) which is almost exactly identical to Mind Warp but does poison damage
instead of psychic. &lt;strong&gt;Deflect Attack&lt;/strong&gt; triggers a little less often (recharge
5-6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in short, this is a much more complicated version of the monster, that’s
much more annoyong to fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-malison-disciple-of-zehir-monster-manual&quot;&gt;Yuan-ti Malison Disciple of Zehir (Monster Manual)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a mouthful of a name, eh? This is a Level 17 Controller with 164 HP. It
projects &lt;strong&gt;Zehir’s Favor&lt;/strong&gt; as an aura (10) which heals allies inside for 5 HP
per turn and does 5 poison damage per turn to enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disciple fights with a &lt;strong&gt;morningstar&lt;/strong&gt; that has a secondary attack
vs. Fortitude to inflict ongoing poison damage (save ends). This does stack with
the aura damage. It will also very often whisper &lt;strong&gt;Soothing Words&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 5
vs. Will; recharge 3-6), which dominate (save ends) and have a daze (save ends)
after-effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;yuan-ti-anathema-monster-manual&quot;&gt;Yuan-ti Anathema (Monster Manual)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-yuan-ti-anathema.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2008 Wizards of the Coast
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anathema used to be the sovereign rulers of the yuan-ti back in the bad old
days, but something happened to drive them mad and turn against their
subjects. Now they are kept imprisoned, and the other yuan-ti placate them with
sacrifices dropped from a safe distance. This is both out of reverence for Zehir
and out of fear that the anathemas will escape their prisons and eat the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These snakes-made-of-snakes are Huge Natural Magical Beasts with the Reptile
keyword. They’re also Level 21 Elite Skirmishers with 412 HP. Their poison
resistance is 20, and their speed is 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;slam&lt;/strong&gt; that also does ongoing poison damage (because
snakes). They can make two of these per action. They can also bite, which does a
bit more damage than a single slam and triggers a secondary attack
vs. Fortitude. This does more ongoing poison damage than the slam, and inflicts
a -4 penalty to attack rolls (save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anathema can &lt;strong&gt;trample&lt;/strong&gt;, moving its speed through enemy spaces (subject to
opportunity attacks) and making a special attack against vs. Reflex against each
one that does damage and knocks them prone. It can also make its &lt;strong&gt;horde of
snakes&lt;/strong&gt; lash out at the same time (close burst 1 vs. Fortitude), doing physical
and ongoing poison damage to those it hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it cares more about moving than about doing damage, the anathema can disperse
into a &lt;strong&gt;swarm of snakes&lt;/strong&gt;, shifting its speed and reforming at the end of the
movement. This also recharges Horde of Snakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, after you’ve cleared the yuan-ti headquarters at the end of paragon
tier, you’re going to discover a whole other dungeon level filled with these
things and other monsters like them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;snaketongue-cultist-minions-monster-manual&quot;&gt;Snaketongue Cultist Minions (Monster Manual)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two cultist minions here: the Level 7 Initiate, and the Level 12 Zealot,
which seem to be skirmishers and are pretty much identical. They have speed 6
and fight with &lt;strong&gt;greatswords&lt;/strong&gt; that do minion-scale damage and have the same
“secondary attack/ongoing poison damage” rider some of their bosses display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;snaketonge-warrior-monster-manual&quot;&gt;Snaketonge Warrior (Monster Manual)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The non-minion version of the cultists discussed above. It’s a Level 8 Brute
with 106 HP, and its &lt;strong&gt;greatsword&lt;/strong&gt; attack is a non-minion version of the one
described above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;snaketongue-assassin-monster-manual&quot;&gt;Snaketongue Assassin (Monster Manual)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Level 9 Lurker has 80 HP and uses a poisoned &lt;strong&gt;dagger&lt;/strong&gt; to fight. It
suffers from the “naturalistic design” flaw, but has a “healthy” dose of ongoing
poison damage on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To protect itself, it uses &lt;strong&gt;Crowd Shield&lt;/strong&gt; tactics, gaining a +2 to AC and
Reflex if it’s adjacent to one creature, or +4 if it has two or
more. Interestlingly, the assassin can also use a move action to assume
&lt;strong&gt;Serpent Form&lt;/strong&gt;, transforming into a Crushgrip Constrictor and using all of its
stat blocks except for HP, which retains its current value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;snaketongue-celebrant-monster-manual&quot;&gt;Snaketongue Celebrant (Monster Manual)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bad guy your players fight just before discovering yuan-ti are behind it
all. This is a Level 11 Controller with 117 HP. It fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Scimitar&lt;/strong&gt; in
melee that has the same secondary poison attack mechanic as the other weapons
here. At range it can use a &lt;strong&gt;Serpent Lash&lt;/strong&gt; spell (ranged 5 vs. Will; recharge
4-6) to do psychic damage and force the target to grant combat advantage for a
turn. &lt;strong&gt;Coils of Despair&lt;/strong&gt; (area burst 5 within 10 vs. Reflex; recharge 5-6)
does no damage but restrains (save ends) and is likely to affect all the PCs at
once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the Assassin, the Celebrant can also use &lt;strong&gt;Serpent Form&lt;/strong&gt; to turn into a
crushgrip constrictor. In this case you might want to give a +2 to attacks,
damage and defenses to the snake form in order for it to match the human form’s
level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of Monster Manual sample encounters tries to tell us why it did have to
be snakes. There are four encounters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 9: a whole bunch of snaketongue cultists and their pet flame snake.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 11: An abomination, a sharp-eye, and more cultists.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 16: A disciple of Zehir, an incanter, and 2 shadow snakes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 22: 2 dark nagas and an anathema. So now you know what the dark nagas
guard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, that sure was a whole lot of snek. If that wasn’t enough for you, you can
also include medusas, since their entry says they some times work together with
yuan-ti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really gave yuan-ti much thought, but the whole Zannad backstory here is
compelling, and it makes them have a lot in common with Lovecraft’s Serpent
Folk.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual/Vault: Wyvern</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-wyvern.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2008 Wizards of the Coast
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyverns have been in the game since its beginnings (or at least since
BECMI). Here, they are present only on the Monster Manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyverns are the most famous “not-quite-dragons” of D&amp;amp;D, and the ones most likely
to be confused with real dragons from a distance. The most obvious visual
difference is that wyverns lack front legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are others, too, which become more evident when you interact more closely
with them. Unlike dragons, wyverns are non-sapient animals, and they also lack
magical breath weapons. Instead, they have a stinger at the tip of their tails
that can inject prey with a potent venom. They’re not as relentlessly voracious
as some of the other fantastic predators described in this book, but I imagine
they still might put a strain on any herds on their chosen territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wild, wyverns live in small groups called “flights”, which roost in high
places like mountains and hunt the surrounding region together. If you see a
flight of wyverns up close, it’s because they’re trying to eat you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyverns can be tamed, but the process has to start shortly after they’re
born. As you might expect, there’s a market for eggs and hatchlings, and sapient
opponents might bring their pet wyverns to the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get stats for two species of wyverns here. Both are Large Beasts with the
Reptile keyword, and fight with their natural weapons: a bite, claws, and the
stinger. Wyverns are good fliers and much more agile in the air than on the
ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that wyvern damage as written is notoriously weak. Fixing this to use the
updated math should be a priority before you include them in an encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wyvern&quot;&gt;Wyvern&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more common variety is a Large Natural Beast with the Reptile and Mount
Keywords, and a Level 10 Skirmisher with 106 HP. Their land speed is 4, and
their flight speed is 8 with Hover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyverns have two basic attacks: a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; with no special effects beyond
damage, and a slightly weaker attack with their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt;, which can only be
done from the air and knocks prone on a hit. &lt;strong&gt;Flyby Attack&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to fly
their speed and make one of these attacks at any point along the way without
drawing opportunity attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also &lt;strong&gt;sting&lt;/strong&gt;, of course, which does a little less damage than the
claw and triggers a secondary attack vs. Fortitude that deals ongoing poison
damage on a hit (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If used as a mount, the wyvern’s &lt;strong&gt;aerial agility&lt;/strong&gt; gives its rider +2 to all
defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m guessing the wyvern doesn’t bite very often. It’s going to use flyby attacks
to knock people prone, or sting if that’s not practical. Only a prone, poisoned
target will get the bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fell-wyvern&quot;&gt;Fell Wyvern&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A larger species which originated in the Shadowfell but is also present in
places where that plane intersects with the world. It’s a Large Shadow Beast and
a Level 24 Skirmisher with 228 HP. Despite not being undead, it has Resist 10
Necrotic and Vulnerable 5 Radiant. Its land speed is 6, and its fly speed is 12
with Hover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fell Wyverns fight mostly like wyverns with bigger numbers, and have all the
same attacks. Their venom causes “necrotic and poison” damage, so it’s harder to
resist. They can also use a &lt;strong&gt;pestilent breath&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude;
recharge 5-6) that does immediate and ongoing necrotic damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a single sample encounter: level 10, an ettin marauder, a basilisk, and
2 wyverns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also imagine either wyvern is a pretty close fit to those fell beasts the
Ringwraiths rode in Lord of the Rings, though their actual level would depend on
how high-powered you view that story as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that wyverns can be mounts, the most clichéd use for them would be to have
them as the “hostile humanoid” flying mount of choice, to have proper aerial
fights against human gryphon cavalry.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual/Vault: Worg</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I see the name “Worg” is in the AD&amp;amp;D 1st Edition Monster Manual,
where it was synonymous with “dire wolf”. The word itself comes from the Lord of
the Rings, I think. In Fourth Edition, they’re only on the Monster Manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worgs are not wolves, though they might be distantly related. Even dire wolves
are just animals, but worgs are sapient and evil. They also have some distinctly
un-wolf-like physical traits when you look at them from up close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worgs like the taste of sapient flesh and prefer it over any other prey. They
live in mazelike warrens, which they decorate with trophies of their
victims. Worgs on the hunt act as a group, but don’t cooperate very well, since
each individual is only interested in satisfying its own thirst for murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worgs willingly ally with other sapient creatures that have a disposition as
nasty as their own, often carrying these allies into battle as mounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the worg also has a larger and meaner relative: the elephant-sized
gulvoorg, which looks nothing like a wolf even from very far away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m guessing you won’t find both worgs and normal wolves in the same wilderness
region - worgs are beefy enough to overpower even dire wolves in direct
fights. They’d enjoy it, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both “strains” of worg are Natural Magical Beasts. They have trained Perception
and Darkvision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;worg&quot;&gt;Worg&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic model is Large and a Level 9 Brute with 120 HP. It has a speed of 8
and its &lt;strong&gt;Frightful Growls&lt;/strong&gt; act as an aura (3) that gives enemies a -1 attack
penalty and allies a +1 attack bonus. Their only attack is a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; which also
does ongoing damage on a hit (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the main benefit of riding a worg into battle is that you’re always in
range of its aura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gulvoorg&quot;&gt;Gulvoorg&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-gulvorg.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2008 Wizards of the Coast
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These monsters are Huge, and Level 16 Elite Brutes with 384 HP. Their speed is
9, and they still have trained Perception and Darkvision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gulvoorg &lt;strong&gt;bites&lt;/strong&gt; are Reach 2, and always knock prone on a hit. They can
perform Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;tail slams&lt;/strong&gt;, which are also considered basic attacks. On a
hit, they both knock prone and daze (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a standard action they can use &lt;strong&gt;Gulvoorg Fury&lt;/strong&gt; to make both a bite and a
slam attack, against different targets and with a -2 attack penalty. That
penalty is completely unnecessary, since we’re talking about an elite monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book gives us two sample encounters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 10: 3 worgs, 2 razorclaw stalker shifters, and 1 oni night haunter. An
oni and its evil henchthings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 17: 2 gulvoorgs and 2 cyclops hewers. It’s even possible the cyclopes
are riding the gulvoorgs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, I like worgs a lot more than I like dire wolves, and wouldn’t be
opposed to merging the two again. That way you get sapient evil worgs with the
interesting mechanical bits of dire wolves. Maybe add some wind powers so they
can huff, puff, and blow your house down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolves are real animals and have been part of the game since its
beginnings. Here, they are both in the Monster Manual and in the Monster Vault’s
animal appendix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real-world wolves are pack hunters, and the ancestors of modern dogs. If I
recall correctly they mostly stay away from people and only attack when cornered
or really desperate. There are enough stories about wolves attacking sheep and
other farm animals that it must have happened in the past, but it’s not really a
common occurrence any more. And that’s partly because there are very few wolves
left in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D&amp;amp;D wolves are of course a lot more common and a lot more willing to attack
people, since a pack of wolves is a classic low-level wilderness encounter. They
can be found across a wide variety of climates and terrains. Mountains? Check!
Forests? Check! Plains? Check! Deserts? Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being D&amp;amp;D, there might be some natural landscapes where your reasonably
realistic grey wolf might have trouble competing with the more fantastical and
powerful monsters common to the game. Instead, these places might feature dire
wolves, which are a larger, smarter and more dangerous variety. As of 3e,
they’re also spikier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being found in the wild, both common and dire wolves might be
trained by humanoids such as goblins or shifters, who have a knack for taming
wolves directly without having to spend centuries turning them into dogs. Other
creatures might also control large packs of them through magic: vampires are
famous for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolves are obviously Natural Beasts, even the dire variety. They have low-light
vision, and their other acute senses are represented by Trained Perception. They
run at speed 8, attack with &lt;strong&gt;bites&lt;/strong&gt; and usually do something interesting when
they have combat advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gray-wolf-both&quot;&gt;Gray Wolf (Both)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gray wolves are Medium, and Level 2 Skirmishers with 38 HP. As far as natural
wolves go, it seems to me these would be on the large end of the scale, which
might explain why they’re more eager to attack humans than you’d expect a
mundane wolf to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their sole attack is the &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;, which does extra damage against prone
targets. The bite in the MV version also allows the wolf to shift 4 squares &lt;em&gt;as
an effect&lt;/em&gt;, so these critters will never stay still if they can help it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a wolf has &lt;strong&gt;Combat Advantage&lt;/strong&gt; against a target, its bite will also knock
the target prone on a hit. This means a group of wolves has a lot of incentive
to flank a specific PC. One of them knocks the victim prone with its first bite,
the others pile on with that bonus bite damage. All of them keep moving around
with those free shifts. And now you know why they call this “wolf-pack tactics”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dire-wolf-both&quot;&gt;Dire Wolf (Both)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dire wolves are Large, which means each is roughly horse-sized. They’re Level 5
Skirmishers with the Mount keyword and 67 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dire wolf &lt;strong&gt;bites&lt;/strong&gt; have larger numbers due to them being higher level, and also
do increased damage to prone targets. They also knock the target prone if the
wolf has &lt;strong&gt;combat advantage&lt;/strong&gt; against the target, and the monsters have more
ways to get that other than plain old flanking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The text for “combat advantage” in the MM version says the dire wolf has CA
against any target who has at least one other ally adjacent to it. No flanking
required. This could be interpreted to mean that a dire wolf with a rider always
has CA against any enemy adjacent to it! The MV version of this trait, named
&lt;strong&gt;Pack Harrier&lt;/strong&gt;, says it only works when the wolf has two or more allies
adjacent to the enemy. So the rider still counts, but you need a second ally to
get the bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have a trait called &lt;strong&gt;Pack Hunter&lt;/strong&gt;, which grants their &lt;em&gt;rider&lt;/em&gt; combat
advantage if an ally other than the mount is adjacent to the target. So if you
go with the MV text, the rider would get CA whenever the wolf got it, and
vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m guessing that the MV version is the “correct” one in all aspects
here. A wolf that got permanent combat advantage against everyone would be a
little overpowered due to that knockdown effect on the bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two sample encounters here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 3: 3 gray wolves, 2 hobgoblin archers, and 1 hobgoblin warcaster. Your
standard hunting party.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 5: 3 dire wolves, and 2 longtooth shifter hunters. A mounted hunting
party.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Werewolves are also quite likely to be leading dire wolf packs, and Count Strahd
in the original Ravenloft module quite famously commanded a literal army of dire
wolves he could send after the PCs every night until they entered his castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dire wolf-riding goblins are also a classic image, though the levels are a
little mismatched as printed. It would be easy enough to level the goblins up or
the dire wolves down, and it’s quite plausible for the Small goblins to be
riding Medium gray wolves instead of the Large dire ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days “you’re attacked by a pack of wolves while on the road” strikes me as
a little uninspired, though I think they’re OK when used as muscle by sapient
opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual/Vault: Wight</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wights have been in the game since its beginnings, part of the original Undead
Power Ladder. Here, they are present only on the Monster Manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might have touched upon this before, but in the implied D&amp;amp;D setting mortal
beings are composed of three main metaphysical “pieces”: the body, the soul, and
the will. The will is also known by sages as the “animus”, and is the “glue”
that holds body and soul together. This is also quite similar to Exalted’s
division of the body, “higher soul” and “lower soul”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What usually happens when someone dies is that the soul separates from the body,
and the animus disintegrates. You get undead when something intereferes with
this process and the animus sticks around, or when someone introduces an
artificial animus into the equation via necromancy. What &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of undead you
get depends on the final configuration of post-mortem body, soul and animus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the soul departs but the animus sticks to the body, you get a wight. Wights
are intelligent, since they retain the use of their brain-meats, but they’re not
really the same person they were in life. In place of a soul they have this
gaping void, which they are compelled to fill by slaying the living and drinking
their life force. A wight doesn’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to do this in order to keep existing,
though, so they hang around for a long time in their haunts waiting for a victim
to wander by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wights typically inhabit the places where they died, though they are not really
bound to them. More ambitious wights might take over catacombs and crypts and go
about finding victims (and treasure!) in a more proactive way. These can find
themselves commanding lesser undead, or perhaps acting as lieutenants for more
powerful villains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wights are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead keyword. As such they’re
immune to disease and poison, and have tier-based necrotic resistance and
radiant vulnerability. They also have darkvision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wights are famously able to drain the life energy of others with a touch. In
previous editions this meant they drained levels (in AD&amp;amp;D) or inflicted
“negative levels” (in 3e). Here this means they eat your healing surges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you can still get them back via a long rest, this does significantly
impact your resources, which is a real bummer in those instances where you can’t
just plop down and rest for six hours whenever the fancy strikes you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deathlock-wight&quot;&gt;Deathlock Wight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one was either a necromancer in life, or learned how to be one after it
died. It’s a Level 4 Controller with 54 HP and all standard wight traits. Its
speed is 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deathlock wight’s basic &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack does necrotic damage, and causes the
target to lose a healing surge. Their &lt;strong&gt;Grave Bolt&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 20 vs. Reflex) is a
much better attack, dealing necrotic damage and immobilizing (save ends). Their
magically-enhanced &lt;strong&gt;Horrific Visage&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Will; recharge 4-6)
does untyped damage and pushes victims 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter they can &lt;strong&gt;Reanimate&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 10; minor action) a fallen
non-minion undead ally. The target stands back up with 25% of its HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MM stat block for deathlock wights has pitifully low damage all
around. Fixing this is a priority if you want to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wight&quot;&gt;Wight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard model is a Level 5 Skirmisher with 62 HP and all standard wight
traits. Its speed is 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic wight’s only attack are its life-draining &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt;, which do necrotic
damage, eat a healing surge, and allow it to shift up to 3 squares on a
hit. It’s simple, but the shift and the life-draining make it quite dangerous
since it can reach your squishies and ruin their day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;battle-wight&quot;&gt;Battle Wight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wight with more formal combat training. It wears plate, and wields a sword and
shield. It’s a level 9 Soldier with 98 HP and all standard wight traits, plus
speed 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battle wight has learned to channel its dark powers through the sword, and
so its basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Souldraining Longsword&lt;/strong&gt; that does necrotic damage,
eats a healing surge and immobilizes (save ends). It can also attack at range
with &lt;strong&gt;Soul Reaping&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6). This only affects
immobilized targets, but deals high necrotic damage and heals the wight for 10
HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;battle-wight-commander&quot;&gt;Battle Wight Commander&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A smarter and more powerful version of the Battle Wight, this one is a Level 12
Soldier (Leader) with 106 HP and all wight traits. It has the same gear as the
basic battle wight, and speed 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commander’s &lt;strong&gt;Souldraining Longsword&lt;/strong&gt; does everything the battle wight’s
does, and also weakens on a hit. A save ends both the immobilization and the
weakness. Soul Reaping gets upgraded to &lt;strong&gt;Soul Harvest&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5
vs. fortitude; recharge 4-6) which works the same but heals both the commander
and 2 undead allies within 10 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;slaughter-wight&quot;&gt;Slaughter Wight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like the basic wight, this one is a monstrosity in rags that attacks with
its claws. It’s just a whole lot stronger and tougher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaughter wights are Level 18 Brutes with 182 HP, all standard wight traits, and
speed 7. Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; do necrotic damage and have a lot of riders: eat a
healing surge, weaken (save ends), heal the wight for 15 HP, and a partrige in a
pear tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When killed, these monsters emit a &lt;strong&gt;Death Wail&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 5 vs. Fortitude),
which does necrotic damage to enemies in the area, and allows undead allies in
the area to make a basic attack as a free action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get several encounters here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 3: 1 deathlock wight, 3 zombies, and 6 zombie rotters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 11: 1 battle wight commander, 4 battle wights, 1 shadar-kai witch, 2
shadar-kai chainfighters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 18: 2 slaughter wights, 3 abyssal ghouls, 1 nabassu gargoyle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wights are a very distinctly D&amp;amp;D monster, but at the same time they kinda get
lost amid all the other similar undead in the game. This might explain why they
were left out of the Monster Vault.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual/Vault: Warforged</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm-4e-warforged.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warforged are a 3e creation, first appearing as a playable option in the Eberron
campaign setting. In 4e they would also become playable characters, but their
first appearance was in the Monster Manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warforged lore given to us by the Monster Manual has been stripped of all
Eberron-specific information, which means it’s extremely terse and generic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warforged are living constructs created by magic. The “living” part means
they’re gifted with true sapience, and with souls. It also means they’re a
little less tough than a golem, but they make up for that with their large
numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warforged are created in magical factories called Creation Forges. They’re
sexless and can’t reproduce in any other way. As their name implies, the
original purpose of the warforged was to serve as an army. In peacetime,
individual warforged often end up working as bodyguards and mercenaries for
people who share their individual ideals and disposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Eberron, the secret of building and operating creation forges belonged
exclusively to House Cannith, who sold warforged armies to all five sides of the
Last War but whose main customer was the nation of Cyre. The treaty that ended
the War (signed after Cyre got swallowed by a magical disaster) freed all
existing warforged from servitude, and I think it also tightly regulated their
creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most warforged PCs from Eberron are going to be veterans of the Last War, which
is like a combination between our Hundred Years War and World War One. However,
in the ruins of Cyre, a powerful warforged supremacist named the Lord of Blades
controls a fully working creation forge and is using it to build an army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warforged in the 4e implied setting might have been alive to see the fall of
Nerath. They could also have been built more recently by someone operating an
Nerathian creation forge, or even assembled by hand by an isolated artificer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warforged are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Living Construct
keyword. Monster Manual warforged have several signature traits: they get a +2
to saves against ongoing damage, they employ &lt;strong&gt;Battlefield Tactics&lt;/strong&gt; that grant
them a +1 bonus to melee attack if any ally is adjacen to the target, and they
can use the &lt;strong&gt;Warforged Resolve&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power as a minor action when
bloodied to recover a healing surge’s worth of HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playable Warforged would appear in the Eberron Player’s Guide: they’d get the
save bonus against ongoing damage and a modified form of &lt;strong&gt;Warforged Resolve&lt;/strong&gt;,
along with a few other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warforged-soldier&quot;&gt;Warforged Soldier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 4 Soldier with 56 HP and all standard warforged traits. It wears
plate, and wields a longsword and a shield. Its ground speed is 5, and it’s
trained in Endurance and Intimidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soldier’s basic (and only) attack is the &lt;strong&gt;longsword&lt;/strong&gt;, which does average
damage for its level and marks for a turn. Its &lt;strong&gt;Warforged Resolve&lt;/strong&gt; heals it
for 14 HP when used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warforged isn’t too different from a human fighter, but its racial traits
give significantly more staying power. You can slap them onto any human stat
block to get the warforged version. If you use them in a tight formation then
most of them will get the +1 Battlefield Tactics bonus all the time when
attacking targets directly in front of the formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warforged-captain&quot;&gt;Warforged Captain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 6 Soldier (Leader) with 72 HP and all common warforged
traits. Its speed is 5 due to armor and its Warforged Resolve heals it for 18 HP
when used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captains fight with a Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;glaive&lt;/strong&gt;, which does average damage and marks for a
turn. It can use this weapon to performa &lt;strong&gt;Tactical Switch&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver (recharge
4-6), in which it makes a basic attack that also slides the target 1 square. If
this hits, the captain or an ally within 10 squares can also shift 1 square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captains excel at fighting from the back row of that warforged soldier
formation, since they have a reach weapon. Tactical Switch is good for
disrupting enemy formations, or interrrupting flanking attempts by individual
strikers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a single sample encounter: Level 4, three human guards, 1 warforged
soldier, and 1 warforged captain. A mixed force that makes it look like
warforged make up the command and elite in this particular army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, these Monster Manual warforged are very simple and present little
in the way of exciting surprises other than the fact that they
will. Not. Stay. Down. If I’m being honest the book might have done without them
entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I absolutely love the &lt;em&gt;concept&lt;/em&gt; of warforged, both as player characters
and as NPCs. I love them so much I adapted them to GURPS &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2017/09/17/dfrpg-warforged.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I understand
why the first MM included these: the Eberron books were still a little ways
away, and the authors might have felt its fans needed a little reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual/Vault: Vine Horror</title>

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many plant monsters of D&amp;amp;D, I’m not sure where vine horrors first
appeared. They look like a 3e thing but could have been in a supplement for an
earlier edition. Here, they’re only on the Monster Manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like shambling mounds, vine horrors are created “naturally” through an unlikely
sequence of events. If an evil person dies in an area touched by the Shadowfell,
their blood might end up soaking the earth and infusing the local plant life,
which animates as a new vine horror. They’re undead-adjacent, but not undead
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vine horrors are humanoid plant masses who bear a vague resemblance to the dead
person whose blood gave them life. Some times they even display some of that
person’s abilities: for example, a vine horror who rises from a wizard might be
able to cast a few spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personality-wise, they display human level intelligence and tend to be cruel
serial killers. The books say they like to ambush and kill passing sapients, but
doesn’t make any mention of them &lt;em&gt;needing&lt;/em&gt; to do it. It would make sense if they
needed to keep draining blood to live, but it also fits to say that a vine
horror feeds on soil and sunlight just like any other plant and just kills
people because it likes to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vine horrors are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Plant keyword. They have
blindsight, a land speed of 6 with both swamp and forest walk, and a swim speed
of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A vine horror’s humanoid shape isn’t a constant - they’re &lt;strong&gt;Malleable&lt;/strong&gt; enough
to squeeze into any 1-inch or wider opening without slowing down at all. They
have &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt;, and can also partially uncoil to strike their victims with vines
whose exact effects vary by stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vine-horror&quot;&gt;Vine Horror&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic model is a Level 5 Controller with 67 HP. Aside from its basic
&lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt;, it can use its &lt;strong&gt;Vicious Vines&lt;/strong&gt; once per encounter. This Close Burst
5 vs. Reflex restrains and does 10 ongoing damage on a hit (save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its Stealth training, varied movement modes and malleability ensure the horror
will be a in a good position to use Vicious Vines as a fight-opener. After that,
it and its buddies can go to town on the weakened party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vine-horror-spellfiend&quot;&gt;Vine Horror Spellfiend&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of a wizard-derived horror who can cast some spells. It’s Level 7
Artillery and has 65 HP. It can only use &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; in melee, but has a lot of
ranged options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shock Orb&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10 vs. Reflex) does lightning damage. &lt;strong&gt;Lashing Vine of
Dread&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5 vs. Reflex; fear) does physical damage and pushes the target 5
squares on a hit. &lt;strong&gt;Caustic Cloud&lt;/strong&gt; (area burst 1 within 10 vs. Fortitude) does
immediate and ongoing acid damage, and also blinds (save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like spellfiends pair wonderfully with shambling mounds, since their
at-will lightning powers can heal the mounds. They can also use their fear vines
to herd the party into position for Caustic Cloud, a process that’s a lot
quicker if you have a pair of spellfiends in the encounter group instead of just
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book does mention the possible shambling mound partnerships, but the example
encounter it gives is a little less synergistic: Level 9, 2 spellfiends, 1 bog
hag, and 2 trolls. A clever party might be able to turn those caustic clouds to
their advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story-wise vine horrors don’t do much for me. They’re just one creepy plant
monster among many others. Mechanically, I’d like to see how an encounter
featuring spellfiends and shambling mounds would go.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual/Vault: Vampire</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legend has it that vampires were an even earlier addition to D&amp;amp;D than the cleric
class - the first cleric was designed specifically to counter Sir Fang, a
vampire PC. As monsters, they were the second most powerful rung in the Undead
Power Ladder, below liches. As expected of a creature with such a long history,
they are present in both the Monster Manual and the Monster Vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vampires in media and folklore are an incredibly varied lot. Each source has a
slightly different type of vampire than the rest, including D&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Monster Vault says, vampires “rule the night”. They’re powerful sapient
undead with an insatiable hunger for the blood of the living, which gives them a
big incentive to interact with the living often. A lich will stay in its lair
and perform experiments for years on end. A ghoul is content to squat in its
hole and brood hungrily until someone wanders by. A vampire has to hunt. A
particularly ambitious vampire will get itself a “flock” to rule over, and
extract blood as tribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine that the scholars who study the subject always argue over whether a
vampire is the same person it was in life. They retain their memories and
intelligence, and they answer to the same name; however, the baroque curse that
propels them also makes them wholly evil, no matter what they were like when
alive. And while it also imbues them with great and terrible power, it takes
away some of the abilities they had in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are as many superstitions surrounding vampires in D&amp;amp;D’s implied setting as
there are in the real world, and very few people know which are true and which
are not. You know all of them: garlic, running water, fear of holy symbols, and
so on. Aside from a vulnerability to sunlight (and other radiant damage, to a
lesser extent), most of these are fake. Perhaps these falsehoods are even spread
by the vampires themselves. The good news is that you can still fight and even
kill them with the usual adventurer arsenal of weapons and magic, it’s just
really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other true vampire fact is that they’re tied to their grave or place of
death. Vampires need to rest during the day, and they must do so either inside
their coffins or crypts, or under the earth of the place where they died if they
didn’t get a formal burial. A vampire who’s prevented from resting in this way
will become less and less rational as the days pass, until it enters a
self-destructive feeding frenzy that lasts until it’s either slain or finally
manages to get some shuteye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above applies to what Fourth Edition calls vampire &lt;em&gt;lords&lt;/em&gt;, which are
the typical sophisticated vampires of editions past. You also have vampire
&lt;em&gt;spawn&lt;/em&gt;, which tend to be weaker and have a personality that can be summed up as
“angry and snarly”. Spawn are created when a vampire spawn drains someone dry -
the corpse rises a day later as a spawn under the complete control of its
sire. A victim incapacitated by blood drain but not killed will enter a coma and
rise as a spawn in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating another vampire lord requires an elaborate magic ritual. This ritual is
named “Dark Gift of the Undying”, and must be performed by a vampire lord on a
mortal victim. There’s an exchange of blood before the victim is killed, and
then the corpse must be buried and numerous prayers and invocations to Orcus
recited over it. A day later, the victim will rise as a new vampire lord. This
process is draining for the sire, so it’s not done lightly. The MV adds that
it’s also possible, but rare, for someone who would rise as a spawn to become a
full vampire instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the turning can be prevented with a casting of Raise Dead before
that one-day interval has elapsed. If the victim is merely comatose instead of
dead, Remove Affliction will also work to prevent the transformation and allow
the victim to be healed normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of vampire player characters has enjoyed enduring popularity ever
since a certain other game introduced it in the early 90’s. So when Heroes of
Shadow came out late in Fourth Edition it added like three or four different
ways to play a PC who could call themselves a vampire (including a full Vampire
class). Unlike the Monster Manual/Monster Vault varieties, these didn’t have to
be evil. I’d be inclined to say the Orcus-worshipping ritual described here only
produces evil vampires, so the non-evil ones in your setting are likely to have
other origins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monster Manual Vampires are built using templates, in a way similar to death
knights and liches. By the time of the monster vault the concept of rigid
monster templates had been dropped, so vampires there are built from scratch
following similar guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both types of vampire are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead keyword. They
have Darkvision and the usual undead traits: immunity to disease and poison and
resistance to necrotic damage (10). Most also have some vulnerability to radiant
damage as well. They also tend to have a high running speed, and a climb speed
with Spider Climb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s fun to point out that back in the AD&amp;amp;D days, vampires didn’t
actually drink blood, or even bite. Instead, they drained your life energy by
punching you in the face. Around the time the Ravenloft setting became popular,
they published a variant that behaved more like you’d expect from a horror movie
vampire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the Monster Manual vampires do explicitly drain your blood, but this isn’t
described as a bite in their stat block. The Monster Vault vampires eliminate
this remaining ambiguity, and have bite attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vampire-spawn-fleshripper-monster-manual&quot;&gt;Vampire Spawn Fleshripper (Monster Manual)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These Level 5 Minion Skirmishers are fairly basic. They have the usual undead
immunities and resistances, darkvision, a speed of 7, and a climb speed
of 4. They attack with a &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; that does necrotic damage, with a small damage
bonus against bloodied targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re also &lt;strong&gt;Destroyed by Sunlight&lt;/strong&gt;: a spawn that starts its turn in sunlight
can only perform a single move action that turn. If this isn’t enough to get
them out of the light, they are destroyed at the end of that same turn. So you
get a dramatic slow death out of them instead of having them pop like soap
bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MM also has a &lt;strong&gt;Vampire Spawn Bloodhunter&lt;/strong&gt; which is level 10 and exactly
the same with bigger numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elder-vampire-spawn-monster-vault&quot;&gt;Elder Vampire Spawn (Monster Vault)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Level 10 Minion Soldier is a little more interesting than the MM spawns. It
has everything they have, but its attacks are a little different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; does physical damage and grabs on a hit (escape DC 18). The spawn
can then &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; the grabbed victim. A hit does more damage than the claw and
dazes the target until the grab ends - and bites against a dazed target hit
automatically. So after the first bite hits, there’s no need to make another
attack roll for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vampire-night-witch-monster-vault&quot;&gt;Vampire Night Witch (Monster Vault)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Monster Vault vampire, the Night Witch is built from scratch and doesn’t
use the template rules. It’s a Level 10 Controller with 98 HP and all common
vampire traits, plus Vulnerable 5 Radiant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all non-minion vampires, the night witch is &lt;strong&gt;Burned by Sunlight&lt;/strong&gt;, taking
5 radiant damage whenever she starts her turn exposed to direct sunlight. Does
the vulnerability get added on top of this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night witch fights with &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; that also slide the target 3 squares on a
hit. She can also cast a &lt;strong&gt;Dream Lure&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5 vs. Will) to do psychic damage
at range, daze the target, and pull them 3 squares. Against dazed or similarly
impaired targets (stunned, unconscious, dominated) she can &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;, which does
high physical damage and heals her for 15 HP on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter, when the night witch takes damage while bloodied, she can
&lt;strong&gt;vanish into shadow&lt;/strong&gt;, becoming invisible until the &lt;em&gt;end of the encounter&lt;/em&gt; or
until she attacks. This is a nice escape hatch and can allow the night witch to
be a recurring opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vampire-lord-monster-manual&quot;&gt;Vampire Lord (Monster Manual)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built using the template rules, this is a Level 11 Elite Lurker with 186 HP who
used to be a human rogue. It has all the vampire traits mentioned in the Numbers
intro, plus Vulnerable 10 Radiant and Regeneration 10 that doesn’t work while
the vampire is exposed to direct sunlight. Sunlight exposure &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; harm it
further than this. Its speed is 8, and it has Spider Climb 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blood-sucking rogue deals extra damage with all of his attacks when he has
combat advantage. He fights with a &lt;strong&gt;short sword&lt;/strong&gt;, and what is probably a
printing error has also given him a &lt;strong&gt;spiked chain&lt;/strong&gt;. He also has a couple of
rogue powers; &lt;strong&gt;Deft Strike&lt;/strong&gt; allows him to move up to 2 squares and make a
melee basic attack. &lt;strong&gt;Imperiling Strike&lt;/strong&gt; is an encounter power that does a bit
more damage than the basic sword and inflicts a -3 penalty to all of the
target’s defenses for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that come the template powers. &lt;strong&gt;Blood Drain&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 1 vs. Fortitude)
requires combat advantage, does more damage than any of the “rogue” attacks, and
heals the vampire for 46 HP. It recharges whenever an adjacent creature becomes
bloodied. &lt;strong&gt;Dominating Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5 vs. Will) does no damage but dominates
on a hit, (save at -2 ends). As an after-effect, the target is dazed (save
ends). Fortunately only one creature can be dominated at a time. And finally,
&lt;strong&gt;Mist Form&lt;/strong&gt; is an encounter power that does what the name implies. In mist
form, the vampire is insubstantial and has a fly speed of 12, but can’t
attack. It lasts for 1 hour or until the vampire ends the effect as a minor
action, so it’s another “escape hatch” power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any vampire built using the template is going to have all three powers in the
preceding paragraph. This one also has a &lt;strong&gt;Second Wind&lt;/strong&gt; that works like the
player version, and recovers 46 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;master-vampire-monster-vault&quot;&gt;Master Vampire (Monster Vault)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Level 12 Lurker with 98 HP, this monster follows the same concept as the
Vampire Lord. It has all standard vampire traits, with &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; radiant
vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s still a vampire and is still &lt;strong&gt;Burned by Sunlight&lt;/strong&gt;, taking 10
damage on any turn it starts exposed to it. It also has &lt;strong&gt;Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt; 10,
which shuts down for a turn if the vampire takes radiant damage (from sunlight
or any other source).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The master vampire fights with &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; like a proper monster, and has a
&lt;strong&gt;Dominating Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5 vs. will) that dominates for a turn. Its &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;
is like that of the Night Witch but heals it for 20 HP instead of 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has the Vampire Lord’s &lt;strong&gt;Mist Form&lt;/strong&gt; power, and it can also turn into a
&lt;strong&gt;Cloud of Bats&lt;/strong&gt; (though not at the same time). That last ability is at-will,
and works very similarly to Mist Form with the following differences: it only
lasts for a turn, the fly speed is only 8, and the vampire gains a +5 bonus to
Stealth in this form. This is clearly what it uses to “lurk”, though it doesn’t
gain extra bonuses beyond CA when it attacks from hiding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounter is level 12 and has 1 vampire lord along with an entire
undead retinue: 1 battle wight commander, 3 battle wights, and 6 vampire spawn
bloodhunters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like vampires as monsters. Looks like the vampire lord/master vampire is tough
to put down even in its Monster Vault incarnation, where it has both
Regeneration and a draining bite. It’s the MM variant that easily crosses over
into “annoying” territory, since Blood Drain heals a lot more &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; it has
Second Wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5e makes a huuuge deal out of Count Strahd, the game’s Dracula expy, but in his
original incarnation he was explicitly described as a vampire who was only a bit
more powerful and clever than what’s average for these monsters. You could
easily stat him up in 4e by making him an Elite or Solo Controller with the
Vampire Master’s gaze, bite, and transformation powers, plus a strong claw/slam
attack and some necromancy-themed powers or rituals. He should be part of an
encounter of the party’s level +3 or +4, suitable as a final boss battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unicorns are actually one of the creatures I associate most strongly with D&amp;amp;D,
since my first contact of any sort with it was the 80’s cartoon with its
adorable unicorn mascot. They’ve been in the game since at least BECMI, and
likely since it’s beginnings. Here, they are only present in the Monster Manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unicorns are horse-like creatures that originate in the Feywild, though some of
them also live in the world. Lots of depictions of them tend to take a horse and
stick the famous spiral horn on its forehead, but mythological unicorns had
other fantastical traits: their hooves are split like a goat’s and not uniform
like a horse’s, and their tail is a bit lion-like with a small tuft at the
tip. They also sometimes had goat-like beards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illustration here nails most of those details, though it still has a
horse-like tail. And its horn is not a cute and delicate spiral at all, but
rather something built to split a fool from crotch to sternum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unicorns are sapient and very intelligent, and have a similar relationship to
their natural habitats as that of dryads or treants. They also have an extra
reason to distrust mortal intruders, as their horns are widely reputed to
contain potent mystical and healing properties. This makes them frequent targets
of hunting expeditions financed by Cocaine Wizards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your typical unicorn has a light-colored coat and mane, but sometimes you get
what is known as a Dusk Unicorn. They’re dark-colored, have black horns, and are
all-around stronger and more majestic. The birth of a dusk unicorn is considered
a portentous omen among the fey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get stats for “standard” and Dusk unicorns. Both are Large Fey Magical
Beasts, with low-light vision and a high land speed from their horselike
build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unicorn&quot;&gt;Unicorn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic model is a Level 9 Skirmisher with the Leader keyword and 93 HP. It
projects an aura of &lt;strong&gt;Fey Warding&lt;/strong&gt; (2) that grants allies within a +2 bonus to
all defenses. Its land speed is 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unicorns attack with their &lt;strong&gt;hooves&lt;/strong&gt; up close, but if they have a running start
they’ll instead use a &lt;strong&gt;Piercing Charge&lt;/strong&gt;, which as you might guess counts as a
charge. A hit does roughly double the damage of a basic kick, pushes the target
1 square, and knocks them prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unicorns can also channel magic through their horns and produce a variety of
effects. &lt;strong&gt;Fey Beguiling&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5 vs. Will) is a charm spell that forbids the
victim from attacking the unicorn and forces them to make opportunity attacks
with a +2 bonus against anyone in reach who attacks the unicorn (save ends). So
remember all those legends of people whose purity charms unicorns and turns them
into friends? It’s actually the other way around! The power can only be used if
the unicorn doesn’t have a currently charmed victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature’s other powers are a &lt;strong&gt;Fey Step&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power that works
exactly like the eladrin version, and a &lt;strong&gt;Horn Touch&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power that
allows the touched ally to spend a healing surge or roll a save against an
effect a save can end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dusk-unicorn&quot;&gt;Dusk Unicorn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These magnificent specimens are Level 12 Elite Controllers with the Leader
keyword, 236 HP, and speed 9. Dusk Unicorns work exactly like the basic model,
but with bigger numbers and a couple of different powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of Fey Beguiling they have &lt;strong&gt;Fey Wisp&lt;/strong&gt; (Area Burst 5 within 10
vs. Will; at-will; no damage), which creates dancing lights in the burst’s
origin squares and pulls any enemies it hits 3 squares towards the lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in addition to Fey Step, they have &lt;strong&gt;Twilight Teleport&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 5;
encounter) which affects only willing allies within range and teleports them to
somewhere else within the dusk unicorns’ line of sight. Yes, only the starting
square has to be within range - the end point can be anywhere visible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you could have something cheesy like a dusk unicorn scrying the party or
looking through a scope, and using that to teleport a bunch of allies right on
top of them. Or you could have this power be the centerpiece of an heroic
sacrifice, as the unicorn transports is allies to safety before being
overwhelmed by the enemy. That works better if the teleported allies are the
PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounter-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounter and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounter is short and to the point: 1 dusk unicorn and 3 banshrae
warriors. Either the unicorn is a psychopath, or the banshrae are unusually
nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like unicorns! These follow the 4e maxim of being potentially usable in a
fight against Good PCs, since they are Unaligned and might have goals that
conflict with those of the party. In previous editions, if you’re fighting a
unicorn it means something went horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically it seems they have so many signature traits (horn and hoof attacks,
Fey Step, Horn Touch, Fey Warding) that it might be easier to make custom
unicorns by adjusting their level and messing with the minor secondary magic
powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umber Hulks have been in the game since at least AD&amp;amp;D 1st Edition. Here, they’re
present in both the Monster Manual and the Vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umber Hulks are insectoid predators native to the Underdark, through which they
roam by digging tunnels with their powerful claws. Tunneling is slow and hungry
work, so they need a lot of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umber Hulk are curious explorers and their tunnels are stable, so they end up
being an important part of the Underdark’s ecosystem. While Purple Worm tunnels
form the “avenues” and “highways” of that subterranean realm, hulk tunnels form
its side roads and streets, linking larger passages and caves together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lacking in both natural stealth or speed, umber hulks like to hunt by tunneling
until they’re about to break through into a larger space, and using their
tremorsense to wait for approaching prey. Then they finish bursting through the
wall and enter combat. Once engaged, they use the psychic powers granted by
their peculiar second set of eyes to attack their victim’s mind, making then an
easier target for their claws. Contrary to what it might seem, the psychic eyes
are the large faceted pair, not the tiny, beady one. Those they use to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hulks are sapient and Unaligned, but not very smart at Int 5. They can’t speak,
but can understand Deep Speech, so it’s possible for PCs to negotiate with them
and avoid violence if they know the language and think to do
that. Unfortunately, they’re another one of those creatures that often gets
enslaved by the evil empires of the Underdark, and avoiding violence with those
is a little trickier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umber Hulks are Large Natural Magical Beasts, with Darkvision and
Tremorsense 5. They usually have a speed of 5, and a burrowing speed of 2 with
the Tunneling enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They fight with their big claws and their psychic gaze, though the exact effects
of those vary per stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;umber-hulk-both&quot;&gt;Umber Hulk (Both)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic model is a Level 12 Elite Soldier with 248 HP. Its gaze confuses
victims and makes them wander around aimlessly, making them easy prey for its
large, grabby, rending claws. The two books model this a bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the hulk’s basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt;, and it can make a &lt;strong&gt;Double
Attack&lt;/strong&gt; with it. If both attacks hit, the hulk grabs the target. The Monster
Vault escape DC is a generous 20, but the MM DC is either the hulk’s Fortitude
of 33 or its Reflex of 28.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference lies in what happens after the monster grabs a victim. The
Monster Manual version (with the higher escape DCs) does ongoing 10 damage to
the grabbed victim. The Monster Vault umber hulk can instead use a standard
action to &lt;strong&gt;Rend&lt;/strong&gt; the victim and do an automatic 40 damage to it, which is like
an automatic hit of its usual double attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their gaze works the same in both versions: It’s a Close Blast 5 vs. Will,
targetting enemies in the area. It does no damage, but slides the targets 5
squares and dazes them (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;umber-hulk-tunneler-monster-vault&quot;&gt;Umber Hulk Tunneler (Monster Vault)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This specimen is a Level 15 Skirmisher with 148 HP. Since it’s not as beefy as
the basic model, it relies on snatching a chosen victim and running away with
it, using its gaze to keep the victim’s friends at bay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack is a bit weak, but the tunneler can use &lt;strong&gt;Double
Attack&lt;/strong&gt; to make two of them against the same target. If both hit, the tunneler
can shift up to 5 squares and pull the victim along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its eyes can cast a &lt;strong&gt;Rebuffing Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Will). The targets it
hits take 2d6 damage whenever they enter a square closer to the hulk during
their next turn. So it’s more of a disincentive to move closer than a
prohibition, and an PC who’s feeling lucky can risk taking up to 10d6 damage
to charge in anyway. At levels 12-15, this is significant but not necessarily
lethal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;umber-hulk-bewilderer-monster-vault&quot;&gt;Umber Hulk Bewilderer (Monster Vault)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This variant relies on its psychic powers more than on its claws. It’s a Level
15 Controller with 148 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack is once again kinda weak, but it does double damage
against stunned targets. The bewilderer can employ a &lt;strong&gt;Stunning Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (close
blast 5 vs. Will; recharge 5-6) as a standard action to stun those enemies it hits for a turn,
and it can use a &lt;strong&gt;Staggering Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Will) as 1/round minor
action to do a bit of psychic damage and slide the target 5 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bewilderers can punch above their weight class if they focus on a single PC, and
if you have more than one such umber hulk they multiply each other’s
firepower. I’d say include at least two in an encounter group where you want
them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deep-hulk-monster-vault&quot;&gt;Deep Hulk (Monster Vault)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an umber hulk from way deeper into the Underdark - it’s a stronger
version of the basic model, a Level 17 Elite Brute with 404 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Umber Hulk but more” describes this creature perfectly. Most of its attacks are
versions of those from the MV basic hulk with bigger numbers: the claw, the
grabby double attack, and the rending (which does 60 damage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Deep Hulk’s gaze gets upgraded to a &lt;strong&gt;Maddening Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5
vs. Will). This attacks every enemy in the blast, as usual. Those that get hit
must spend a standard action on their next turn making a basic attack against an
ally in range. If there’s no ally in range, they must charge the closest ally. I
guess it’s a “maddening” gaze because it will make your players pretty mad even
though it only lasts for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, the gaze is an at-will attack, so a deep hulk can open the fight with it,
spend the next turn clawing a PC, and from them on alternate the gaze with the
claws (or the rending). It won’t even give up too much damage potential if the
party includes lots of people with good basic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shadow-hulk-monster-manual&quot;&gt;Shadow Hulk (Monster Manual)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of this monster is the same behind the Deep Hulk: a bigger, badder
Umber Hulk from deeper in the Underdark. The implementation is quite different,
however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow Hulks are Huge Shadow Magical Beasts, which hints that they might have
been mutated by magical leaks from the Shadowfell somewhere down there. They’re
Level 17 Solo Soldiers with 860 HP. Their land speed is 6, their burrowing speed
4, and they have &lt;em&gt;phasing&lt;/em&gt;, which means they might not actually burrow much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow Hulks attack with their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt;, have the grabby &lt;strong&gt;double attack&lt;/strong&gt;, and
bite the grabbed victim for 15 ongoing damage. While bloodied, they can also
make &lt;strong&gt;claw frenzy&lt;/strong&gt; attacks (close burst 3 vs. AC; recharge 6) which do the
same damage of the basic attack over an area. They also have the Deep Hulk’s
&lt;strong&gt;Madening Gaze&lt;/strong&gt;, which they can use as an &lt;em&gt;at-will minor action 1/round&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I get why we got the Deep Hulk in the Monster Vault instead of a more
direct conversion. Fighting 860 HP of umber hulk with higher AC and accuracy
than normal, and who can both claw &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; use a maddening gaze every round, is a
bit much. Still, if your players are cocky, you can update the Shadow Hulk and
throw it at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounter is level 13, 2 umber hulks and 2 drow warriors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hulks from the Monster Vault are much better than the ones from the Monster
Manual. If you have the Vault, you can disregard the MM versions entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like Umber Hulks! They’re a big dumb brute monster with some really
interesting tricks to go with he usual physical attacks. Fighting them requires
a bit more thought because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
