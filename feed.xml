        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Star Spawn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Though the Warlock class was introduced late in D&amp;amp;D 3.x, it was Fourth Edition
that really made it shine. In addition to the infernal warlocks of the previous
edition, the Player’s Handbook also gave us fey and star pact
warlocks. Different pacts provided different mechanical and lore flavor, and
made the class approachable to people who didn’t want to play someone who had
literally sold their soul to the devil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fey warlocks were an immediate hit because they tied to the lore of the Feywild,
which was awesome from the start. You get your powers from David Bowie’s Goblin
King, what’s not to love about that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I personally loved star warlocks, their lore required a certain previous
familiarity with “cthulhoid” narratives that was by no means universal among D&amp;amp;D
players. I mean, in this one-shot I GMed shortly after acquiring the books I had
a player who honestly believed they were supposed to be New Agey
astrologers&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I’m talking about PC warlocks in a Monster Manual reading is that
those paragraphs provide the context you need to understand why the &lt;em&gt;Wish Upon a
Star&lt;/em&gt; article from Dragon #366 was such a big deal. While it was mostly focused
on adding more options for star warlocks, it also included the first concrete
bit of lore on the “pact entities” for star warlocks. More information about
them would be added in subsequent books, and in the Monster Manual 2 they get an
entry for monsters themed after them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people in 4e’s implied setting don’t think too hard about the stars in the
night sky. To many they’re just pretty lights. Amateur astronomers can point out
constellations and identify a few specific stars by name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True scholars of the stars know about the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; constellations. They know that
some of those stars have fallen under the influence of certain powerful
entities, who use them to gaze at the world from across the infinite void. Their
gazes might be filled with fury, with hunger, or with emotions unfathomable to
feeble mortal minds. When you speak their true names, they listen, and might
even answer. Opinions differ as to whether that is a good or a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stellar entities are usually associated with the Far Realm. Traditional
lore about the Far Realm says it’s a separate plane of existence, so according
to that it could be that these entities are using their stars as windows to our
plane. But this also raises an alternate, scarier possibility: maybe the “Far
Realm” isn’t a separate plane at all. Maybe it’s just what you find if you
travel far enough into the void.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every star is the avatar of an eldritch alien being, though some star
warlocks have recurring nightmares where every star in the sky opens up to
reveal an eye staring at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the information on the known eldritch stars comes from a scroll known as
&lt;em&gt;The Revelations of Melech&lt;/em&gt;, which is the sort of rare sanity-blasting tome that
should be very familiar to Call of Cthulhu players. It has the same in-world
status the Demonomicon of Iggwilv (which lists demons) or the Codex of Betrayal
(devils).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we get into the lore contained in the MM2. The most learned students of
the sky know of an orange star named Allabar, The Opener of the Way. Allabar
only appears when the world is about to enter a time of great turmoil, be it a
great war, a mighty ritual, or something similar. It races across the sky in a
seemingly random trajectory that passes by one or more of the other “special”
stars. When this happens, the way is opened for that star to release a Star
Spawn into the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Star Spawn are the anthropomorphic personifications of a specific star’s
will. Once they enter the world, they seek to enact that will. Some stay for
only as long as the conjunction with Allabar lasts, other can remain
indefinitely or until defeated. Some are solitary, others gather cults and
minions around themselves. Regardless of their specific MOs, star spawn tend to
be pretty evil from a mortal’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one knows for sure how or why this whole process happens. Is Allabar a
natural phenomenon of the void, or a sapient being with designs of its own? Is
there a rhyme or reason to its wanderings? The warlock Thulzar claimed to have
charted every star spawn incursion since the fall of Bael Turath and found a
pattern, but he vanished along with his tower and all his notes after a starless
night, leaving only a glassy crater behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Monster Manual 2 contains three Star Spawn in this entry, and we’ll look a
bit more into their specific lore and the lore of their star in their sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Star Spawn are Aberrant Humanoids. The first one in this entry is Medium, all
others are Large. All of them have Darkvision, a ground speed of 6, and
communicate using telepathy with a range of 10 squares. Everything else about
them varies per stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;herald-of-hadar&quot;&gt;Herald of Hadar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-star-spawn-herald.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morinbund Hadar used to be the brightest star in the sky. During the
tribulations that led to the fall of Bael Turath, it flared up into a burning
brand visible even during the day. Afterwards, it faded to a barely visible red
ember. Hadar’s dying gasps send its heralds into the world so they can harvest
life energy and delay its inevitable end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only Medium star spawn in this entry, heralds of Hadar look almost human
save for their glowing eyes and hostility to all forms of life, which they
attempt to drain. They’re Level 15 Brutes with 180 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heralds use their &lt;strong&gt;Hungry Claws&lt;/strong&gt; to fight, and they can make two basic attacks
with a single action. Once per encounter they can step it up and use &lt;strong&gt;Feeding
Frenzy&lt;/strong&gt; to make up to three attacks (though no more than two on the same
target). Their life-force drain is the &lt;strong&gt;Breath of a Dying Star&lt;/strong&gt;, a Close Blast
5 encounter power that targets Reflex, does good damage, and prevents targets
from regaining HP and spending healing surges (save ends). I imagine the claw
attacks drain life as well, but that’s probably just represented as part of
their damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever someone spends a healing surge within 5 squares of the herald,
&lt;strong&gt;Hadar’s Hunger&lt;/strong&gt; allows it to react in a variety of ways. Choose one whenever
this triggers: shift 3 squares closer to the triggering creature; make a basic
attack; regain the use of an encounter power; gain +2 to attacks for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like the Herald will want to focus most of its attacks on a single PC,
but will use the Breath on the others. That way it will leave someone still able
to spend healing surges so it can recharge its powers. Despite their “berserk”
fighting style, heralds are still sapient and capable of making alliances of
convenience with other creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maw-of-acamar&quot;&gt;Maw of Acamar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-star-spawn-maw.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Hadar is dying, Acamar is already dead. This corpse-star is a black void that
devours everything that passes by it, even other stars and their light. Its
hunger is endless and without a purpose other than consumption itself. The Maws
of Acamar are avatars of that hunger, living gateways through which the dead
star can extend its ruinous grasp to the world. Unlike the other Spawn, they
come to the world under their own power, for even The Opener of the Way avoids
passing too close to Acamar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maws are Level 15 Controllers with 145 HP. Where Heralds of Hadar fight with
berserk intensity, Maws of Acamar just kinda stroll around the battlefield and
let the constant effects of their presence do the work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gravitational field of their black hole progenitor is expressed as an aura
(5) named &lt;strong&gt;Hungry Star&lt;/strong&gt;. Anyone inside who wishes to move away from the Maw
must pay 3 movement points per square instead of the usual 1. Even if they do
it’s futile because the Maw can use &lt;strong&gt;Corpse Star’s Grip&lt;/strong&gt; (Close Burst 5
vs. Fortitude; minor action) to pull them 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The destructive part of that gravitational pull is expressed as 2 different
attacks, both of which inflict ongoing damage instead of instant
wounds. &lt;strong&gt;Devouring Star&lt;/strong&gt; is a Close Burst 3 attack targetting Fortitude that
inflicts 10 ongoing damage; &lt;strong&gt;Devouring Touch&lt;/strong&gt; is a focused Reach 2 version
that inflicts 15 ongoing damage on a single target. In both cases the
&lt;strong&gt;Destroyer of Life&lt;/strong&gt; passive trait prevents adjacent enemies from shedding all
of that damage with a single save. The save only reduces the total damage by 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s possible to meet multiple Maws at once. They love to surround foes and
tear them apart by pulling them in several directions at once. I’d probably make
them immune to each other’s attacks, but that’s wouldn’t be the case for any
other ally. Anything and anyone who stands too close to a Maw is going to be
sucked in. If you pair them with other monsters, they would do well to stay away
from their “buddy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scion-of-gibbeth&quot;&gt;Scion of Gibbeth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-star-spawn-scion.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gibbeth is a cursed green sun which gestates at its core an unknowable
being. Warlocks and the like say that this being will only show its true face at
the end of the world, and this will send the tattered remains of the universe
into inescapable madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scions of Gibbeth are shards of this green star, providing a little taste of
what is to come. No two people who see one can agree on its appearance, save to
say it is horrible. Perhaps its true form is literally incomprehensible to
mortal minds, and the varied appearances described are a result of the people in
question instinctively trying to cope with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These abominations wander the world pursuing their enigmatic goals. They tend to
attack any living creature that draws too close, but they tolerate the presence
of worshippers and cultists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scions are Level 17 Controllers with 163 HP. Their abilities work at range and
are designed to keep PCs away. They’re surrounded by an &lt;strong&gt;Aura of Revulsion&lt;/strong&gt;
with size &lt;em&gt;10&lt;/em&gt;, enough to cover most of the battlefield. Creatures inside can’t
target the Scion with melee or ranged attacks unless it’s the enemy nearest to
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its basic attack are vanilla &lt;strong&gt;Slams&lt;/strong&gt;, but the others make up for
it. &lt;strong&gt;Mind-Splintering Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (range 20) deals light psychic damage and
dominates (save ends); &lt;strong&gt;Gibbeth’s Baleful Glare&lt;/strong&gt; does the same damage and
slides the target 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sets up the Scion’s basic tactics: stay well away from the PCs and dominate
them, gently nudging them away when they attempt to close. If they do manage to
close, there’s a couple more tricks available to the creature. &lt;strong&gt;Offering to
Gibbeth&lt;/strong&gt; gives it a +2 attack bonus for a turn whenever a PC spends a healing
surge within 2 squares of it; and &lt;strong&gt;Revelation of Gibbeth&lt;/strong&gt; is a burst 5 that
triggers when the Scion dies. This glimpse of its true form acts as an attack
against Will. Affected targets are Dazed, and must spend their sole action
charging or making a basic attack against their nearest ally. This is a &lt;em&gt;save
ends&lt;/em&gt; condition, so even if the dead Scion was the last monster on the board,
the party might still need to contend with the effect for a few rounds until
everyone makes their save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love all of this star lore! It feels so new, you know? It’s “cthulhoid”
without actually involving the Cthulhu Mythos and this is a big entry about
aberrant monsters that doesn’t contain a single tentacle anywhere in it. It’s
also scarier in places than even the traditional fiend lore. “There’s a place in
a different plane that’s full of evil fire” doesn’t quite have the same visceral
kick as “each star opens to reveal an eye and they’re all looking at you”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even think it’s cool that Hadar’s and Acamar’s basic descriptions are the
result of taking a real astronomical entity and running it through a Lovecraft
and/or Death Metal translator filter. A red supergiant is “ancient and dying,
gasping for breath as it tries to prolong its doomed existence”. A black hole is
a Corpse Star!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think they ever officially added Atropus from Elder Evils to the star
“pantheon”, but he’s a perfect fit. “The World Born Dead orbits The Corpse
Star!”, cries the mad warlock as invisible star spawn tear him limb from limb in
broad daylight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only place where I think this entry stumbles a bit is the sample
encounters. The lore of the star spawn is cool but it makes them stand a bit
apart from the more traditional D&amp;amp;D monsters, so it feels strange to see them
paired with those same monsters. You might need to reskin some of those monsters
to make them more star-aspected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two encounters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 13: A Herald of Hadar teams up with a Beholder Eye of Flame and 2 Battle
Wight Commanders. A classic front-line and artillery formation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 13: A Maw of Acamar is accompanied by 2 hook horrors and 2 mind flayer
infiltrators. Here you want the others to form a perimeter around the Maw and
try to keep the PCs boxed in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;There were also mechanical reasons for why they didn’t become as popular,
  but these have been more extensively discussed elsewhere and don’t quite
  fit a monster-focused post. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Sprite Swarm</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-sprite-swarm.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprites are super-tiny humanoid fey, tinier even than the pixies that would show
up as a playable option in &lt;em&gt;Heroes of the Feywild&lt;/em&gt;. I think they’ve been in the
game since at least AD&amp;amp;D 1st Edition in some for or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprites in earlier editions tended to be described as just tiny fairy folk who
liked all the usual Victorian Fairy things like song and dance and pastoral
nature. They might have a propensity for pranks, but normally didn’t get more
aggressive than that unless the PCs were out to exterminate them. A single
sprite was pretty much harmless, but they often came in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t the sprites from earlier editions. These are Umbral Sprites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umbral Sprites are just as tiny as the nice variety, but they’re cruel,
violent, and territorial. Interactions between them and the PCs skip right past
the talky and pranky stages and go right to combat as swarms of these things
descend upon them. A single umbral sprite is still harmless to an adventurer,
but a swarm of them is dangerous enough to get monster stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though these tiny terrors are native to the Feywild, they tend to seek out areas
that contain crossings to the Shadowfell to claim as territory. Spriggans and
ill-intentioned gnomes tend to ally with them and use them as diversions for
subtler schemes. It’s hard to notice gnomes sneaking into your vaults when you
have a cloud of angry sprites poking out your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry gives us stats for a fairly small swarm of umbral sprites. This is a
Medium swarm composed of Fey Humanoids, and counts as a Level 4 Controller with
55 HP. It has blindsight with range 6, a ground speed of 4, and a flight speed
of 6 with Hover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has the standard swarm traits: it takes half damage from single-target
attacks, and extra damage from area attacks. Its &lt;strong&gt;Swarm Attack&lt;/strong&gt; aura (1) deals
3 damage to creatures caught inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Swarm of Fangs and Blades&lt;/strong&gt;, but aside from the name
it’s nothing spectacular. Their special &lt;strong&gt;Darkwave&lt;/strong&gt; attack (recharge 5+) is
more impressive. It’s a Close Burst 3 that targets Reflex, does necrotic damage,
and creates a zone of darkness that lasts for a durn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have the gnome’s &lt;strong&gt;Fade Away&lt;/strong&gt; power, becoming invisible as a reaction
to taking damage once per encounter. This invisibility lasts for a turn, or
until they hit or miss with an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When fighting a group of PCs, they’re going to rely on Darkwave to keep them in
the dark and will use basic attacks and the swarm aura to deal damage while that
power recharges. The sprites are unaffected by their own darkness due to their
blindsight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can model a larger group of umbral sprites by using several swarms in an
encounter, or by increasing the level and size of a single one. They also make
me think about adapting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/152691/The-Dreams-of-Ruin&quot;&gt;The Dreams of Ruin&lt;/a&gt; to 4e, because they look like
they are the base creature for Murdersprites. A murdersprite swarm is probably
more like a Colossal Level 14-18 Brute, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounter is Level 5, and is a grab-bag of Feywild hazards: 2
ettercap fang guards working with 2 sprite swarms and 2 fey panthers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t find spriggans in my 2nd edition and earlier books, but I know they’re
in Pathfinder, so they were probably introduced in D&amp;amp;D 3.x. This entry is their
4e debut. It feels like there’s been some condensing here because this entry
also uses several other names that I’m sure belonged to separate “small evil
fey” enemies, like “redcap” and “powrie”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/04/21/gnome.html&quot;&gt;post on gnomes&lt;/a&gt;, we already saw that the gnome people used to be
enslaved by the fomorians in the ancient past, but that they managed to
escape. Here, we learn that not all of them managed to get away. Those
unfortunates were eventually twisted into spriggans by fomorian magic. It’s
unclear whether this happened as punishment for the escape attempt, or during
some subsequent experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book doesn’t describe present-day spriggans as fomorian slaves, so maybe
they were discarded by their former masters as failures. They live in
underground settlements excavated under rugged terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fomorian magic warped spriggan hearts as much as it did their bodies. Soaking
stuff in the blood of enemies seems to be a big deal to them. Their habit of
doing that to their hats caused them to also be known as redcaps by other
sapients. Spriggan communities delight in raiding, tormenting and extracting
tribute from their weaker neighbors, behaving pretty much like bandit gangs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spriggans are Small Fey Humanoids with low-light vision and a ground speed
of 6. Their signature ability is &lt;strong&gt;Redcap Zeal&lt;/strong&gt;, a free-action encounter power
that grants them temporary HP when they bloody or defeat an enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spriggan-giantsoul&quot;&gt;Spriggan Giantsoul&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giantsouls tap into the fomorian magic in their blood, which gives them enhanced
strength and the ability to stretch their arms to gain a giant’s reach. They’re
Level 8 Brutes with 106 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These spriggans fight unarmed, using &lt;strong&gt;slams&lt;/strong&gt; as their basic attack. The
stretch-arm thing comes into play in the &lt;strong&gt;Giantsoul Slam&lt;/strong&gt; special attack
(recharge 4+), which is Reach 2, does the same damage as the slam, and knocks
prone on a hit. Both attacks deal bonus damage when the spriggan is bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter, the giantsoul can use a &lt;strong&gt;Surprise Slam&lt;/strong&gt;, an interrupt that
triggers when an enemy within 2 squares of them attacks an ally. This allows it
to use Giantsoul Slam against the triggering enemy, recharging the ability if
necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re good frontliners, with a limited ability to protect squishier allies
when the PCs try to get around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spriggan-powrie&quot;&gt;Spriggan Powrie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All spriggans use iron-shod boots as part of their combat gear, but powries have
a particular dedication to the fine art of stomping. They’re Level 7 Skirmishers
with 79 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The powrie fights with a &lt;strong&gt;sickle&lt;/strong&gt; that does light physical damage and inflicts
ongoing damage. It can also be used in a &lt;strong&gt;Hamstring&lt;/strong&gt; special attack that has
the same effects and also knocks prone and slows for a turn. This recharges when
the powrie is first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against prone enemies it can use the amusing &lt;strong&gt;Punt The Fallen&lt;/strong&gt; attack, which
deals the same damage as the sickle and pushes 3 squares. The best thing about
this attack is that it’s an at-will minor action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the powrie has combat advantage against a creature taking ongoing damage,
attacking that creature with any of the above will also increase their ongoing
damage by 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;strong&gt;Blood Slide&lt;/strong&gt; passive trait prevents the powrie from provoking
opportunity attacks when leaving a square adjacent to a creature who’s bloodied
or taking ongoing damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So most of the time a powrie will be attacking enemies with the sickle and
moving around the battlefield with the aid of Blood Slide in order to spread as
much ongoing damage around as possible, and will then seek combat advantgae
against a single target. Hamstring and Punt the Fallen is an hilarious
combination, and the latter means powries pair really well with other enemies
who can drop targets prone more often. Multiple powries in a fight mean you can
begin an impromptu soccer match with a prone PC as the ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spriggan-thorn&quot;&gt;Spriggan Thorn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spriggan thorn is armed with a short sword and a light shield, which are
imbued with a curse of thorns. The sword itself is enveloped in them, and the
spriggan can curse an enemy and cause thorns to spring from under their
skin. It’s a Level 6 Soldier with 71 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Short Sword&lt;/strong&gt; damages and inflicts ongoing damage (thorns!). It can be
enhanced with the &lt;strong&gt;Drowsing Puncture&lt;/strong&gt; power as a minor action. This makes the
next attack daze the target for a turn and knock them prone, if it hits. It
recharges when the thorn is first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curse is called &lt;strong&gt;Mark of Thorns&lt;/strong&gt;, and it’s an encounter power that
automatically hits a target in a Close Burst 5. A cursed target can’t make
opportunity attacks against the thorn, and takes 4 damage at the end of any turn
in which it didn’t attack the thorn. Any allies of the target that start the
turn adjacent to them also take 4 damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drowsing Puncture is a fine skill to use against PC defenders, and the Mark is
quite versatile. When used against a defender, it allows the thorn to slip past
the PC front-line unmolested. It also works to diver the attention of any PC who
would normally gain more by attacking one of the spriggan’s more fragile
allies. They pair really well with powries, who can end up increasing the
ongoing damage caused by the swords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spriggan-witherer&quot;&gt;Spriggan Witherer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Witherers are spriggan spellcasters who specialize in harmful weather control
magic. They can probably cause serious trouble to agrarian communities with
rituals, and they can also create more localized effects useful in
combat. They have an obsession with soaking the earth in blood, so they pair
well with enemies with a similar imagery. They’re Level 8 Artillery with 70 HP
and the Leader keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their melee attack is a &lt;strong&gt;whithering touch&lt;/strong&gt; vs. Reflex that deals necrotic
damage. Their main single-target ranged attack is &lt;strong&gt;Sun Scorch&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 10
vs. Reflex) dealing fire and radiant damage. They can use a spell named
&lt;strong&gt;Flattening Wind&lt;/strong&gt; either as a close blast 3 or as an area 3/range 10 attack
vs. Fortitude. This deals physical damage, pushes 2 squares, and knocks
prone. It recharges when they’re first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After they’re bloodied, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Blood For the Earth&lt;/strong&gt; at will. This is an
area 2/range 10 attack that deals light physical damage, inflicts ongoing
damage, and gives 5 temporary HP to any allies caught in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes for an artillery threat that starts off fairly aggressive and
switches to more of a support role as the fight proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spriggans are fairly good at fulfilling the “small evil fey” niche, and I love
the ties to fomorian lore. There are some good synergies between the stat blocks
presented here,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spriggans can still be found working for fomorians, but some also work for evil
eladrin or run their own rackets. They keep dangerous plants and animals around
their settlements for protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounter is level 9: an evil eladrin twilight incanter with a pet
shambling mound and a quartet of spriggan goons (2 giantsouls, 2 witherers).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Spider</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing that D&amp;amp;D doesn’t lack, it’s monstrous spiders. The Monster
Manual gave us a bunch of them; the Monster Vault would update some of these and
add new ones. The Monster Manual 2, published between those two books, adds a
whole new batch that doesn’t overlap with either of the other books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the spiders here have Tremorsense 10 and a climb speed enhanced by the
Spider Climb trait, which allows them to walk on ceilings. They also have a Web
Walker trait that allows them to ignore difficult terrain caused by
webs. Finally, they have the very obvious Spider keyword, which allows them to
be affected by all those drow and ettercap abilities that benefit “spider
allies”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bristle-spider&quot;&gt;Bristle Spider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-spider-bristle.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These elephant-sized arachnids were originally bred by oni to serve as their
mounts. In our narrative present, several other peoples have adopted them as
well. Their biggest fans are the ettercap and the drow, neither of which have
ever met a spider monster they didn’t like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bristle spiders can also be found in the wild, where they inhabit dense jungles
and caves. These environments tend to have enough cover to allow even these huge
monsters to hide effectively and ambush their prey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bristle Spiders are Huge Natural Beasts, and Level 15 Elite Lurkers with 232
HP. They have a ground speed of 8 and a climb speed of 6. I don’t know if they
make webs themselves, but they still have Web Walker. As lurkers, they’re
trained in Stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is a venomous &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; that deals damage with slow and
ongoing poison damage riders. They can also spit an &lt;strong&gt;Acidic Poison Spray&lt;/strong&gt; in a
Close Blast 5. This targets reflex and deals both instant and ongoing “acid and
poison” damage, and also slows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those bristles are also useful in combat as part of the &lt;strong&gt;Bristle Blast&lt;/strong&gt; attack
(recharge 4+). This is a minor action, Close Blast 5 attack against
Fortitude. It deals no damage, but a hit blinds and dazes the target for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being an elite, the bristle spider lacks a double attack
ability. Instead it relies on its at-will acidic poison blast to hit multiple
PCs per attack, with a side order of bristles to keep them vulnerable. It would
probably work better as an elite controller than an elite lurker, with more HP
and better AC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounter is level 14 and has a bristle spider acting as a palanquin
for a drow priestess and her drow blademaster bodyguard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;phase-spider&quot;&gt;Phase Spider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-spider-phase.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A returning classic, Phase Spiders have undergone some changes to account for
the absence of an Ethereal plane in 4e. Here, they’re fey spiders with innate
teleportation powers. They were originally created by the eladrin as biological
weapons meant to infiltrate the halls of the drow and wreak havoc inside. It’s a
spider arms race!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These spiders can survive nearly anywhere as long as they have prey to
hunt. Their favorite targets are fey creatures, to the extent that they’ll go
after the fey members of a mixed-origin party even if a non-fey target would be
more advantageous. This behavior was probably an attempt by eladrin wizards to
get them to go after drow. You can imagine how that turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phase Spiders are Large Fey Beasts, and Level 8 Skirmishers with 87 HP. They
have ground, climb, and &lt;em&gt;teleport&lt;/em&gt; speeds of 6. Good luck pinning them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;bites&lt;/strong&gt; deal somewhat low damage, but have a dangerous rider: targets
are initially slowed, but after the first failed save they become
unconscious. This is also a (save ends) condition, but the victim is completely
unable to act while it lasts &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; is even more vulnerable to attack than if
they were “just” stunned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethereal Bite&lt;/strong&gt; allows the spider to teleport 10 squares and make a bite
attack, working as a good ambush starter. &lt;strong&gt;Ethereal Repulsion&lt;/strong&gt; is an interrupt
that triggers when an enemy moves adjacent to the spider: it attacks their Will
and teleports them 4 squares on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes ranged attacks the best way to deal with phase spiders. They, in
turn, will eagerly teleport to the party’s back line and munch on the squishies,
relying on Ethereal Repulsion to delay any rescue by the melee defenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounter is level 7 and features two eladrin fey knights leading a
pack of three trained phase spiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tomb-spider&quot;&gt;Tomb Spider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-spider-tomb.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These rotund arachnids are a Shadowfell species that has particularly strong
incentives to seek out passages into the world. Their lifecycle requires them to
lay eggs inside corpses, so they seek out crypts and graveyards for use as
breeding grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the eggs hatch they animate the corpse, which acts as ambulatory shelter
for the hatchlings until it finally splits open and lets them out. Orcus
cultists just looove tomb spiders, as do all other types of death-themed
villain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomb Spiders are Large Shadow Beasts, and Level 11 Elite Controllers with 226
HP. They have Resist 10 Necrotic, along with ground and climb speeds of 6. Their
&lt;strong&gt;bites&lt;/strong&gt; damage, daze, and inflict ongoing necrotic damage (save ends
both). Someone bitten by the spider can’t use the Second Wind action until the
end of the encounter, though they can still be healed by other means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These spiders definitely to spin webs: they can shoot &lt;strong&gt;Web Nets&lt;/strong&gt; at single
targets as a minor action (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex). A hit restrains the target and
makes them vulnerable to necrotic damage until they pass a save. Less often,
they can squeeze out a glob of &lt;strong&gt;Webbed Terrain&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), which affects a
large area and immobilizes on a hit. Hit or miss, the webs remain as difficult
terrain until the end of the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounter is level 11 and features a deatphriest of orcus leading 2
battle wights and 3 cultists to battle, using the tomb spider as armored
support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tomb-spider-broodswarm&quot;&gt;Tomb Spider Broodswarm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-spider-tomb-broodswarm.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a swarm of tiny tomb spiders that has just burst out of their corpse
nest. It’s a Medium Shadow Beast (Swarm), and counts as a Level 10 Lurker with
84 HP. It has the standard spider traits from this entry, and the standard swarm
traits of being resistant to melee and ranged attacks, and vulnerable to area
attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;strong&gt;Swarm Attack&lt;/strong&gt; aura (1) slows those caught inside. Its &lt;strong&gt;Swarm of Bites&lt;/strong&gt;
attack is a lesser version of mommy’s bite, and instead of attacking it can use
&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Drift&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) to shift shift 5 squares and gain +4 to all
defenses for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no stats for the undead corpse that houses the spiders, but you can
probably use something like a non-royal mummy described as being wrapped in webs
instead of linen wraps. Depending on your tastes, it could be a minion that
disgorges a Broodswarm when killed, a &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt; that does the same (and thus
counts as an elite two-stage monster), or a regular reskinned mummy if you want
the young swarm to die when it dies instead of bursting out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No sample encounter here, as the adult tomb spider used the space for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kinda like the phase and tomb spider mechanics… but in the end, it’s more
spiders. By the end of the edition we’ll end up with enough spider variants that
you’ll have one for every situation, but you should definitely not use all of
them in the same campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Sphinx</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-sphinx.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sphinxes already made their 4e debut on the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/12/27/sphinx.html&quot;&gt;Monster Manual&lt;/a&gt;, and the MM2
gives us an additional variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore-of-the-sphinx-mystery&quot;&gt;The Lore of the Sphinx Mystery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All sphinxes have a common origin as sacred guardian beasts, as described in the
&lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/12/27/sphinx.html&quot;&gt;Monster Manual entry&lt;/a&gt;, but not all of them are exactly alike. This stat
block represents an individual with preferences and abilities different from
those of the typical MM1 sphinx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All sphinxes have the ability to propose challenges that help separate intruders
from visitors who have a right to be at the places they guard. Riddles are a
classic but are far from the only option, and the MM1 entry made some effort to
stress that part. Here, though, we go the other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sphinx Mystery is an individual who’s &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; into riddles. She doesn’t just
use them as her basic authentication scheme: she also uses them as weapons in
the middle of an actual fight. She likes riddle games so much that she might
just choose to keep playing rather than fighting with lethal intent, if her
opponents can keep the game fun for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intruders who can’t answer those riddles are in real trouble, though, because
they do real damage and are as sticky as warlock curses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sphinx Mystery is a Level 19 Brute with 224 HP. Despite being a regular, she
still has an action point. This might be an editorial error, but it’s fun so I’d
keep it. She also has low-light vision, and moves at ground and air speeds of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of her attacks are part of the standard lion beast arsenal. The likely
fight-opener is a a &lt;strong&gt;Terrifying Roar&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) that targets Fortitude,
deals thunder damage, pushes 5 squares, and knocks prone. Her basic attack are
&lt;strong&gt;Ancient Claws&lt;/strong&gt; that do heavy damage, and she can also use a &lt;strong&gt;Bite
of Ages&lt;/strong&gt; that deals light damage, knocks prone, and immobilizes with the weight
of history (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, the Mystery can use &lt;strong&gt;Riddle Me This&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 10). This is
an at-will ability that represents the sphinx compelling someone to solve a
riddle. This “hits” automatically, and dazes the target until the riddle is
answered or until the encounter ends. Answering the riddle requires spending a
minor action and succeeding at a DC 25 History check. Anyone can attempt the
test on their turn, not just the affected PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the targetted PC doesn’t attempt to solve the riddle on their turn, they take
2d8 psychic damage at the end of that turn. They also take this damage if
someone else answers the riddle for them. This damage is light, but about in
line with the amount of “traditional” ongoing damage an effect at this level
would cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the target will be dazed, which means that if they attempt to answer
the riddle, that’s the only thing they can do on their turn. So it might be
better to let an unaffected buddy answer it and eat a single instance of that
psychic damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mystery’s last attack is the amusingly named &lt;strong&gt;Corrective Maul&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a
claw attack that does even more damage and recharges whenever anyone fails to
answer one of her riddles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The riddle mechanic is awesome! It makes the sphinx very controllery despite her
being a Brute. Since the riddle is ranged, you’ll want to delay her entry into
melee combat a bit until she can apply it to every PC. As a regular monster, the
sphinx will always be found alongside a few buddies, so they can help with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounter is level 16: 2 nothic cacklers, 2 savage minotaurs, and a
sphinx mystery. This is either an evil sphinx running with other assorted
marauders, or a more traditional guardian who has managed to recruit several
would-be intruders to her service through riddles and bets.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Slaughterstone Construct</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I think Slaughterstone Constructs first appeared on the D&amp;amp;D Miniatures game in
late 3e. Their naming style marks them as a construct created after the
“(Material) Golem” namespace had been mostly exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The approach to an underground dwarf fortress usually consists of a number of
narrow tunnels, and that’s where most of the fighting happens when these places
are attacked. Tunnel fighting is a nasty affair, particularly when it’s two
large armies going at it. No place to run, no place to hide. Each inch of ground
is bought with lives, and when you advance you step on the bodies of foe and
friend alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaughterstone Constructs are the dwarven answer to this problem. They’re
defensive siege engines built for the singular purpose of making sure the only
ones who die are the invaders. Their intended usage is that you set them loose
on a tunel and watch them run through it while turning everyone inside into
chunky salsa. Their extreme toughness and strength means not many armies can
stand up to them even in a more open field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a proper slaughterstone construct is quite difficult. To sculpt the
body, you need a solid block of stone upon which the blood of a hero has been
shed. Even if you have that stone, only the very best dwarf artificers can turn
it into a construct. You’ll only find these things defending the largest and
wealthiest dwarven kingdoms, or other places that have good relationships with
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the blood requirement doesn’t mean you need to &lt;em&gt;sacrifice&lt;/em&gt; a hero on
the stone block. You could cut the stone from a cave or tunnel where that hero
has fought. Alternatively, if your GM likes this sort of technically correct
solution you could get yourself a brand new stone block and ask a certified war
hero to prick their finger and let a drop of blood fall on it. Neither of these
methods is easy (heroes don’t grow on trees!) but they’re far more ethical than
sapient sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have neither a master artisan nor a source of heroic blood but you still
want your blender tank, you can pay a middling craftsdwarf for a knockoff that’s
less reliable but still pretty strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get three varieties of slaughterstone constructs here. Two “genuine” models
and a knockoff. All of them are Large Natural Animates with the Construct
keyword. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 6, and the ability to squeeze
into Medium passages without any penalties and without granting combat
advantage. They’re immune to poison, disease, and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their Int is 1, the worst possible score, but you don’t need more than that when
your only two functions are “walk forward” and “kill”. They probably respond to
commands of equivalent complexity like “stop killing” and “go back to your
garage”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;slaughterstone-eviscerator&quot;&gt;Slaughterstone Eviscerator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-slaughterstone-eviscerator.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eviscerators are armed with a large number of whirling scythe blades, and look
a bit like super-edgy stone mantids. They’re Level 18 Brutes with 212 HP. The
blades never stop moving, and to model that they have a &lt;strong&gt;Whirling Blades&lt;/strong&gt; aura
(2) that deals 10 damage to anyone caught inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As weapons, those blades are are Reach 2 and have the High Crit property. Their
basic attack deals heavy damage to a single target, and they can also be used in
a &lt;strong&gt;Whirling Bladestorm&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 6+) that hits everyone in a Close Burst 2
for average damage. This makes them as dangerous in the open as in a tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;slaughterstone-hammerer&quot;&gt;Slaughterstone Hammerer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-slaughterstone-hammerer.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are more robust than eviscerators and mount stone hammers instead of
blades. Once they reach you, it’s really hard to get away from them. Hammerers
are Level 25 Soldiers with 233 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They project a &lt;strong&gt;Thunder Step&lt;/strong&gt; aura (2) that slows those caught inside. The
hammers can be used in two different attacks: a basic &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; that deals
average damage and knocks prone, and a &lt;strong&gt;Hammerstrike&lt;/strong&gt; that deals the same
damage and dazes (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of the hammerer’s skills mark enemies, but if you use them properly enemies
will have no option but to attack the hammerer anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;slaughterstone-slicer&quot;&gt;Slaughterstone Slicer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our “knockoff”, described as a less powerful version of a genuine
eviscerator. It’s a Level 11 Elite Brute with 276 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slicers have pretty much the same attacks and traits as eviscerators, with
smaller numbers due to the level difference. Their Bladestorm is supposed to be
an encounter power that recharges when the slicer is first bloodied, despite the
“at-will” tag on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have a tendency to malfunction, becoming dazed for a turn after they
either deal or take a critical hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth Edition’s combat rules make these constructs even more dangerous than the
lore indicates. Both the lore and the rules say a construct “plugs” a tunnel and
prevents enemies from passing through. The rules also say that allies may freely
move and attack through each others’ spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means slaughterstone constructs pair really well with artillery monsters,
and with controllers that have good ranged attacks. They’re also pretty good
with skirmishers who can dart forward, attack, and move behind the construct
again. Even if they can’t do all that in the same turn, their exposure to the
PCs is still reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our example encounters are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 11: 1 duergar blasphemer, 2 duergar fleshtearers, 1 slaughterstone
slicers. Looks like it’s not just dwarves who build these.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 18: 2 Eldritch Giants, 1 Nothic Mindblight, 2 Slaughterstone
Eviscerators. Maybe they conquered a dwarf fortress and stole the constructs?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 25: 1 Beholder Eye of Chaos, 1 Oni Thunderer, 3 Slaughterstone
Hammerers. This is the “strong artillery”, “mobile skirmisher” setup I
mentioned, in its epic incarnation. You think you’re safe because the corridor
is 6 squares wide, and then you see three constructs side by side blocking all
of it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Slaad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaads already made their 4e debut in the first Monster Manual, and you can
check out the post I wrote on them &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/12/23/slaad.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This MM2 entry brings us a
lower-level, less-popular slaad type and an alternate mechanic for the horrific
slaad spawning cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;flux-slaad&quot;&gt;Flux Slaad&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-slaad-flux.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flux slaads seem to be the runts of the slaad family. They’re weaker and
stupider than their relatives, they can’t spawn, and their chaotic mutations are
at best a mixed blessing. Still, being weaker actually means they might have an
easier time slipping through a dimensional crack into the world, which they love
because it allows them to lord it over creatures even weaker than them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flux slaads who slip into the world often end up conquering bullywug tribes and
setting themselves up as their god-kings. Finding one of these on the throne
instead of the usual “slightly stronger frog-dude” can be an interesting
experience for cocky PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flux Slaads are Medium Elemental Humanoids, and Level 9 Skirmishers with 98
HP. They have low-light vision, a ground speed of 7, and a teleport speed
of 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They fight with their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt;. They can use those in a &lt;strong&gt;Flux Rage&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver
that allows them to shift 2 squares and attack everyone they pass by during this
movement. This recharges when they’re first bloodied. When they take damage from
an attack, they can shift 1 square as a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing special so far, but now we come to the part that gives these slaads
their names. &lt;strong&gt;Slaad Vulnerability Shift&lt;/strong&gt; should really have a name that
includes the word “flux” in it. This trait makes the slaad start out with random
vulnerability determined by a d6 roll: (1) cold, (2) fire, (3) lightning, (4)
necrotic, (5) psychic, (6) thunder. The slaad has Vulnerability 10 to that
damage type, but Resistance 5 to all the other table entries. Every time the
slaad takes damage from its current weakness, you roll the die again and
determine a new weakness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;slaad-spawn&quot;&gt;Slaad Spawn&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-slaad-spawner.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most slaads reproduce by infecting victims with a disease called Chaos Phage,
which causes slad tadpoles to gestate within the victim’s flesh. The tadpole
grows and eventually erupts from its host, running away to mature
elsewhere. This was covered in the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/12/23/slaad.html&quot;&gt;MM entry&lt;/a&gt; for Slaads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few of them are instead infected with a mutant strain of chaos phage, which
produces embryos in their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; flesh. These slaads are covered in gross giant
boils that pop when they’re wounded, spawning miniature versions of
themselves. These spawn are both almost mindless and extremely aggressive, so
they often get used as weapons by their “parents”. Should they survive the
circumstances of their birth, the spawn develop quickly and begin exhibiting
powers similar to those of an adult within days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers-1&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spawn are Small Elemental Humanoids, and Level 17 Minion Skirmishers. They have
low-light vision, a running speed of 5, and a teleport speed of 3. They attack
with &lt;strong&gt;bites&lt;/strong&gt; and can also pounce using a &lt;strong&gt;Chaotic Slam&lt;/strong&gt;. On a hit, they
damage and knock down the target. On a miss, they explode, dealing a bit of
damage in a Close Burst 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also get stats for an elite template named &lt;strong&gt;Slaad Spawner&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be
applied to any Large-sized regular slaad. This is turns the slaad into an elite
monster, and adds a &lt;strong&gt;Spawn Slaad&lt;/strong&gt; reaction power that creates a new slaad
spawn whenever the spawner is hit by an attack. The new spawn appears adjacent
to the spawner, and acts right after the spawner’s action. The template is
unusual in that it doesn’t add additional HP to the regular monster. It does
bring a new minion into play every round, so maybe they thought this was enough
to make up for their lower HP. The spawner is worth double the experience of the
original slaad, but the spawned minions aren’t worth any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flux slaad is kinda meh aside from its “weakness roulette” mechanic. The
roulette is interesting, but your party needs a lot of damage types (or a lot of
lucky d6 rolls) to keep it spinning. Otherwise it’s going to stop on a type they
can’t use, which means the slaad becomes resistant to the types they can. At
least you can always beat it up using physical damage, which means martial types
can end up being more effective against it than the casters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you could build a “puzzle boss” that had the same mechanic, plus some
way for the party to influence the result of the d6 roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaad spawn and the Spawner template bring another flavor of body horror to a
slaad fight. Since it seems spawn mature even faster than tadpoles, a spawner
presents an even nastier apocalyptic scenario than a normal slaad. It also
presents the GM with an excuse to throw lots of de-leveled slaads against a
heroic tier party, since those could be “immature” slaads that have grown past
the spawn stage but not developer all the way yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our two sample encounters are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 8: A death shard, 3 flux slaads, and 2 slaad tadpoles. Likely brought to
the world by a small Elemental or Abyssal rift.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 17: 2 blue slaads, 1 green slaad, 8 slaad spawn. The blues and green are
likely minding their little siblings and doing a typical slaad job of it. Note
that the spawn are worth XP in this encounter, since they’re not “produced” by
an on-site spawner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Skeleton</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-skeleton.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Monster Manual already included &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/12/13/skeleton.html&quot;&gt;plenty of skeletons&lt;/a&gt;, so this time
we just get a couple more of them. The basic lore remains the same and you can
see it in the link above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonecrusher-skeleton&quot;&gt;Bonecrusher Skeleton&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Large-sized skeleton that used to belong to an ogre, minotaur, oni, or similar
creature. Not having to haul all that flesh around makes it surprisingly fast
for its size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Large Natural Animate with the Undead keyword, and a Level 7 Soldier
with 80 HP. It has all usual skeleton traits: darkvision, immunity to disease
and poison, resist 10 necrotic, vulnerable 5 radiant. It runs at speed 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skeleton wields a Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;greatclub&lt;/strong&gt;, and it can use it to perform a
&lt;strong&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/strong&gt; (reach 2; recharge 6+) that does more damage and knocks the
target prone. Its superb agility is expressed as &lt;strong&gt;Threatening Reach 2&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;skeletal-steed&quot;&gt;Skeletal Steed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A horse skeleton that can act as a fearless and tireless mount, proving that
mundane horses truly suck in 4e. Even a dead horse is better mount than a live
one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skeletal horses are Level 3 Skirmishers with 47 HP, darkvision, and immunity to
disease and poison. They don’t have resistance to necrotic damage or
vulnerability to radiant damage. Their ground speed of 8 and their fearless,
untiring nature make them highly desired as mounts by people who don’t mind the
whole skeleton thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If forced to fight the skeletal steed uses &lt;strong&gt;kicks&lt;/strong&gt; like a normal horse, and
they can also perform them as part of a &lt;strong&gt;Mobile Melee Attack&lt;/strong&gt;. You know the
drill on this one: the steed moves its speed, makes an attack at any point along
the way, and doesn’t draw opportunity attacks. It can also emit a &lt;strong&gt;Death
Shriek&lt;/strong&gt; (fear; close burst 3; recharge 5+) that does no damage and inflicts a
-2 attack penalty (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When used as a mount, the steed allows its rider to join in on the Mobile Melee
Attack. Either the rider makes a basic attack while still allowing the steed to
kick, or the steed gives up its attack to allow the rider to use a non-basic
power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new skeleton types rise in much the same way as the other ones. Most often
it’s because a necromancer intentionally animates them, but sometimes a freak
accident with necrotic energy can cause them to rise up as well. In such cases,
skeletal steeds tend to rise along with their former riders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get two sample encounters here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 5: 1 deathlock wight and 2 standard wights riding skeletal
steeds. Ancient horsemen riding again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 6: 1 orc eye of Gruumsh plus a zombie hulk and three bonecrusher
skeletons. Orc necromancer and his undead ogres.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Shark</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-shark.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharks are are real-world animals, and this Monster Manual 2 entry is their
debut on D&amp;amp;D Fourth Edition. The &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/11/11/sahuagin.html&quot;&gt;Sahuagin&lt;/a&gt; entry from the first Monster
Manual mentioned them a lot but that book didn’t have shark stats. The Monster
Vault did have them, and we already looked at its take on sharks in the post
linked above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many species of real-world sharks, with very varied looks and
behavior. Rather than worry about any of that, the Monster Manual 2 gives us a
fantastic species based on our worst fears about sharks. Witness the horrible
might of the Fleshtearer Shark, the bullete of the sea!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleshtearer sharks seem to be kinda modeled on the shark from Jaws. They’re big,
they’re stupid, they’ll try to eat anything they can bite, and that can include
boats. These sharks can thrive anywhere, I do mean anywhere: not only can you
find them in oceans of any temperature, they sometimes live in rivers and lakes
and even swim in the Underdark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleshtearers can live for hundreds of years and never stop growing, which can
make those subterranean sharks even larger and stronger than the typical
specimen presented in this entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sahuagin and kuo-toa usually steer clear of fleshtearer sharks because they’re
too dangerous to tame, but sometimes a heroic trainer among them will manage the
feat. In this case, the “tame” flesh-tearer is used in raids against large
ships, eating anyone who falls overboard and biting holes in the hull.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleshtearer sharks are Large Natural Beasts with the Aquatic keyword. They’re
Level 10 Brutes with 128 HP and low-light vision. They swim at speed 8, but can
only flop around at speed 1 on land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aquatic keyword gives the shark a +2 attack bonus against non-aquatic
opponents when both are in water, and it also has a custom &lt;strong&gt;Waterborne&lt;/strong&gt; trait
that stacks a +2 damage bonus on top of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is of course a &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt;, but they also have several special
maneuvers. &lt;strong&gt;Lockjaw Charge&lt;/strong&gt; is a charge attack that also grabs the
target. Grabbed targets are vulnerable to the shark’s &lt;strong&gt;shredding teeth&lt;/strong&gt;, which
always hit and deal heavy damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shark has no special ability to pull a grabbed victim along when it moves,
so it must use the standard rules for doing that (opposed Strength tests). It
can also choose to stay in place while it chews into the victim with Shredding
Teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fleshtearer shark will lurk out of detection range until it picks a target
(the tastiest-looking PC). It will then use Lockjaw charge on them, relying on
its toughness to weather any opportunity attacks. It will probably release the
grab and swim away for another pass rather than getting pinned down by the other
PCs, but it’s too obstinate to run and usually fights to the death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shark’s bloodlust often gets in the way of those tactics, which is
represented by a trait named &lt;strong&gt;Feeding Frenzy&lt;/strong&gt;. When the shark starts its turn
within 5 squares of a bloodied creature, it must make a bite attack against a
creature adjacent to itself, which will also make it release a grabbed victim if
it has one. “Creature” here means both allies and enemies can trigger the effect
and be valid targets for the bite attack. Even a “tame” shark is dangerous to
its allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a movie shark, doing movie shark things. If you’re adventuring on or under
water, you might run into it, otherwise it won’t usually impact your adventuring
life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make them Huge and level them up to represent Underdark sharks, in which
case they might make good thralls for Aboleths and for Mind Flayers who want to
fight Aboleths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get one sample encounter here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Level 10: 2 fleshtearer sharks, 1 sahuagin baron, 2 sahuagin priests. This is
likely the “command squad” for a bigger raid against a large ship or coastal
village. They’d stay a bit further away from the front lines, and engaging
them might be necessary to end the raid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Shadar-kai</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-shadar-kai.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already saw the basic lore of shadar-kai back in [Let’s Read the  Monster
Manual][2], and the Monster Manual 2 brings a few more stat blocks for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where they add the lore about Shadar-kai seeking extreme sensations to
stave off the soul-draining malaise of the Shadowfell. As I said in the original
post, I prefer to ignore this bit. If you want to add it in, the book also
mentions that offers of novel and/or intense experiences tend to be
well-received when one negotiates with shadar-kai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this book we get paragon-tier Shadar-kai, which one can usually meet in the
Shadowfell proper. They retain the MM1 signature traits (low-light vision and
the Shadow Jaunt ability), and get a new gimmick in the form of a new status
effect they can inflict: &lt;em&gt;shrouded in gloom&lt;/em&gt;. A victim who is shrouded in gloom
takes a -2 penalty to attacks and gains only half the benefit from healing
effects. This seems to always be a “save ends” condition. Their ground speed is
7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the new stat blocks presented here were named by someone who decided
that simple descriptive names like the “Warrior” and “Witch” of the first book
weren’t nearly goth enough. Let’s check them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shadar-kai-blacksoul&quot;&gt;Shadar-kai Blacksoul&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blacksouls are spellcasters specializing in harmful shadow-based magic. They’re
level 14 Controllers with 138 HP, and all their attacks are spells. &lt;strong&gt;Corrupting
Blackfire&lt;/strong&gt; is a basic melee attack that deals fire and necrotic damage;
&lt;strong&gt;Shadowbolt&lt;/strong&gt; is a basic ranged attack that deals necrotic damage; and
&lt;strong&gt;Shadowburst&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 6+) deals necrotic damage over a wide area. All three
also shroud the target in gloom on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blacksoul’s ultimate attack is &lt;strong&gt;Corrupt Soul&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets Will and
dominates (save ends). It can only target victims who are shrouded in gloom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shadar-kai-dawnkiller&quot;&gt;Shadar-kai Dawnkiller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This absurd edgelord is a Level 14 Lurker with 106 HP. They carry a pair of
&lt;strong&gt;kukris&lt;/strong&gt; whose strikes shroud the target in gloom and can also be used to
perform a &lt;strong&gt;shade strike&lt;/strong&gt; that does the same damage and blinds instead. Their
&lt;strong&gt;Shadows of the Raven Queen&lt;/strong&gt; trait gives them bonus damage against targets who
can’t see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dawnkillers likely alternate shade strikes and basic attacks, focusing on a
single PC. They pair really well with the spellcasters from this entry,
providing an extra source of “shrouded in gloom” so their buddies can use their
ultimate attacks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shadar-kai-gloom-lord&quot;&gt;Shadar-kai Gloom Lord&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gloom Lords are spellcasters of the same tradition as blacksouls, with a
slightly different spell selection. They’re Level 14 Artillery with 108 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attacks are the same, and their special technique is named
&lt;strong&gt;Shadowcage&lt;/strong&gt;. This is an at-will ranged attack that targets the Reflex of a
creature shrouded in gloom. It deals necrotic damage, restrains the target, and
prevents it from moving more than 2 squares away from its original position
until it passes a save to clear all of these effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sharar-kai-painbearer&quot;&gt;Sharar-kai Painbearer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re not in pain, they bring the pain to you. Painbearers are Level 15
Skirmishers with the Leader keyword and 144 hP. They wear leather and wield
spiked chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is named &lt;strong&gt;shadow chain&lt;/strong&gt;, which does damage and shrouds in
gloom as usual. They can also perform a &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Dance&lt;/strong&gt; that allows them to
shift their speed and make three shadow chain attacks against different targets
along the way. Each attack after the first deals an extra 2d6 damage for every
previous attack that hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the Skirmisher part. The Leader part comes from two other abilities. The
first is a &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Weft&lt;/strong&gt; aura (5) that allows shadar-kai allies within to
shift 1 square after they hit with a melee attack. The second is &lt;strong&gt;Shadow
Boon&lt;/strong&gt;, a reaction that allows an ally within 10 squares to re-roll an attack
they just missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m surprised we didn’t get a stat block that was literally named Shadar-kai
Edgelord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical shadar-kai combat encounters will be either agains the villainous sort
that consorts with undead, or the morally ambigious yet antagonistic sort that
swears fealty to the Raven Queen. A more complex encounter might find the PCs
aiding the latter against the former. Either sort of shadar-kai might be riding
nightmares, because of course they would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get two sample encounters here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 13: two dawnkillers and a painbearer accompanied by a
bodak. Undead-loving villains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 14: A blacksoul, 2 gloom lords and 2 painbearers. A team where every
member is a brooding loner, Kamen Rider-style.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
