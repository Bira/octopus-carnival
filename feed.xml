        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Star Spawn</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Star Spawn made their debut in the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2022/02/03/star-spawn.html&quot;&gt;Monster Manual 2&lt;/a&gt; along with a pretty
awesome chunk of lore that’s also tied to star pact warlocks and the Far
Realm. You can see it all on the link. This entry adds a bit more lore, new star
spawn, and a surprise epic boss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lore in this entry confirms some of the most terrible questions we had in
the MM2. Yes, if you travel far enough in space you do end up in the Far
Realm. Yes, there are things watching across this divide, and some of them are
perceived by the people of the middle world as stars. And yes, some of them have
hostile designs upon the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allabar, the Opener of the Way, is one of these, and it travels across the
universe inciting its fellow stars to send their spawn into the world. Its
wanderings are not random, but filled with terrible purpose. Some warlocks claim
Allabar and its allies are at war with the world itself, and they call this the
Forgotten War because it’s much less noticeable than the Dawn War was but no
less significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The star spawn presented here are all mid-to-high epic tier threats, making them
a lot stronger than the paragon-tier spawn from the MM2. All of them have the
aberrant origin and possess darkvision, but the specifics vary a lot between
individual stat blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spawn-of-ulban&quot;&gt;Spawn of Ulban&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-ulban.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ulban is a blue-white star whose intense glow affects mortal minds, disrupting
their cognition and robbing them of the ability to recognize danger. Ulban’s
influence starts ill-thought rebellions and prevents divinations of any sort
from working. Its spawn fall to the earth as meteors, and their presence makes
mortals unable to distinguish friend from foe. They also break the “no
tentacles” streak for this type of monster, as you can see in the illustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spawn of Ulban are Medium Aberrant Humanoids, and Level 26 Controllers with 241
HP. They have a speed of 8. They’re immune to domination, and every time they’re
iht by a power that would dominate them, they dominate the attacker instead! And
this is a (save ends) condition even if the one from the attack wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spawn’s basic attack is the &lt;strong&gt;Bluefire Strike&lt;/strong&gt; (vs. Reflex), which causes
both cold and fire damage, and dazes for a turn. It can also use a &lt;strong&gt;Touch of
Strife&lt;/strong&gt; (vs. Will) instead, dealing psychic damage and forcing the target to
make a melee or ranged basic attack against a creature of the spawn’s
choice. When it hits with either of these attacks, it can apply a &lt;strong&gt;Psychic
Boost&lt;/strong&gt; as a free action, dealing an extra chunk of psychic damage. This
recharges every time the spawn takes psychic damage, so while it’s not
&lt;em&gt;resistant&lt;/em&gt; to this damage type you still don’t want to use it against the
spawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less often, the spawn can produce a &lt;strong&gt;Ripple of Betrayal&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 1
vs. Will, recharge 5+) which deals psychic damage and dominates those it hits
(save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, the spawn can use &lt;strong&gt;Far Realm Reflection&lt;/strong&gt; to form an
eldritch bond with a creature it can see. Whenever that creature shifts, the
spawn can immediately shift an equal number of squares. This lasts until the end
of the encounter, or until the spawn switches targets by using the power
again. An excellent power to use on an ally that can shift long distances, or
even on a PC that can do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spawn of Ulban wants to get in close and stay there, since its attacks are
all melee or close bursts. It’s extremely effective against parties with lots of
psionic PCs, or against those that have lots of Essentials martial
characters. The best way to fight it is to keep your distance and hit it with
non-psychic, non-dominating attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;emissary-of-caiphon&quot;&gt;Emissary of Caiphon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-caiphon.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caiphon is a purple star that can always be found near the horizon, sometimes
even during the day. It presents itself as a helpful guide star, but will
sometimes betray those who rely on it, leading them down tragic paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emissary of Caiphon is often employed in these betrayals. It’s the most
human-looking of all star spawn, and it mimics the tactics of its patrons by
posing as a guide or a prophet. Its “wise and helpful” advice usually leads to a
lot suffering and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emissary is a Medium Aberrant Humanoid, and a Level 28 Controller with the
Leader tag and 257 HP. It projects an &lt;strong&gt;Aura of Ruin&lt;/strong&gt; (2) that inflicts a -2
penalty to saves, and whenever it’s hit by an attack that would blind it, it
blinds the attacker instead (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly all of the Emissary’s powers mess with the saving throw mechanic, but it
lacks the ability to inflict (save ends) conditions by itself. Be sure to pair
it with plenty of monsters who can do that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Touch of Despair&lt;/strong&gt; that deals light physical damage and
inflicts an extra 20 damage the first time the target fails a save before the
start of the emissary next turn. It’s nifty, but it’s for emercencies only. The
creature prefers to stay far away and use its ranged attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blinded By Greed&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10 vs. Will) deals light psychic damage, slides the
target 2 squares, and forces them to make a melee basic attack against a target
of the emissary’s choice (“Give me that! It’s mine!”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blinded By Need&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10 vs. Will) deals standard psychic damage, and
allows the emissary to choose one of the target’s allies. For the next turn, the
target is marked by that ally, and everyone except the chosen ally is invisible
to the target. This doesn’t &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; the target and the ally to fight each
other, but it makes it hard for either of them to do anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As minor actions, the emissary can use &lt;strong&gt;Deceptive Veil&lt;/strong&gt; to disguise itself as
a Medium or Small humanoid, with a DC 40 for people to see through the
illusion. It can also target someone with an &lt;strong&gt;Invocation of Calamity&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged
5 vs. Will), which on a hit makes the target fail all of their saves during the
next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For triggered actions, it has the same &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Boost&lt;/strong&gt; as the Spawn of Ulban,
this time applying to tis Blinded By Need/Greed powers. And when it dies,
&lt;strong&gt;Foretelling the Doom&lt;/strong&gt; targets an enemy suffering from a (save ends) condition
and inflicts a -5 penalty on all saves against it until one succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;serpent-of-nihal&quot;&gt;Serpent of Nihal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-nihal.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nihal, the Serpent Star, is a reddish celestial body that can’t stay still. It
travels a random snaking route around the point it was supposed to occupy in the
sky according to all standard calculations. That’s why it received this
epithet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Serpents of Nihal first came through the world shortly before the fall of
the ancient empire of Az-Kiral, which dedicated itself to the worship of
Zehir. Its leaders grew ever more ambitious and soon they craved more power than
the snake god was willing to offer. So they sought out a new source of Snek
Power, and found it in Nihal. They opened a portal to the star thinking they
would be able to access this power. What happened instead was that countless
Serpents of Nihal poured through, and destroyed the empire in a matter of
days. They still wander the known cosmos today, and I guess sometimes Allabar
opens new rifts to let more through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serpents are Medium Aberrant Beasts, and Level 29 Minion Lurkers with a ground
speed of 7. They’re only partially present in reality, and keep blinking in and
out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that, despite being minions, they have &lt;strong&gt;Resist 20 to all
damage&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, even untyped. You need to deal 21 or more damage with one strike
to take them out. It’s not that hard for late epic PCs, but it’s also not 100%
guaranteed, so they have more staying power than your typical minion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serpents attack with &lt;strong&gt;mindbites&lt;/strong&gt;, which deal psychic damage and can interfere
with concentration and psionic power usage: if 2 or more of the serpent’s allies
are adjacent to the target, the bite deals extra damage and prevents the target
from spending action points or power points (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an enemy misses the serpent, it can &lt;strong&gt;Depart Reality&lt;/strong&gt;, removing itself from
play for a turn an re-appearing in adjacent to an enemy within 20 squares of its
original location. It can also do this exact same thing when it rolls initiative
with the &lt;strong&gt;Sudden Reality Warp&lt;/strong&gt; ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;allabar-opener-of-the-way&quot;&gt;Allabar, Opener of the Way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-allabar.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, you read that right. This is not a star spawn, it’s a &lt;em&gt;star&lt;/em&gt;. Allabar is
here to serve as the end boss for a campaign focused on the Forgotten War, which
would likely feature the PCs facing and unraveling the plans of increasingly
powerful aberrant creatures and star spawn until Allabar itself decides to
personally kill them. As the lore implies, Allabar is not the only eldritch star
who wants to mess with the world, but it’s the most consciously malicious one
and it acts as instigator and enabler to the others. Eliminating Allabar would
effectively end the threat posed by its fellows and their respective star spawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting the lore in astronomical terms would make Allabar similar to a rogue
planet, a planet without a star that moves across the universe. The similarity
is only superficial, of course, because pretty much nothing else about the
Opener of the Way is in any way scientific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allabar is presented here as a Gargantuan Aberrant Animate. Those who feel even
Gargantuan is too small for a planetary entity might instead say this is an
avatar of Allabar, the thing it sends through a portal to personally fight the
PCs. When it dies, the star winks out from the sky. Or you can take a page from
Atropus in Elder Evils, and have the actual body of Allabar be the
dungeon/battlefield on which you fight its avatar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Allabar is a Level 30 Solo Soldier with 1100 HP. It has ground and
flight speeds of 6, with Hover. As a planet, it projects a &lt;strong&gt;Gravity Well&lt;/strong&gt; that
acts as a 20-square wide aura. This plus its Gargantuan size pretty much mean it
covers the entire battle map. Anyone who starts their turn inside the field gets
pulled a variable number of squares depending on how much HP Allabar currently
has. It starts at 1 square, and doubles for every 25% of its HP that are missing
(at 25% or less total HP, it’s 8 squares).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being covered with eyes, Allabar has &lt;strong&gt;All-Around Vision&lt;/strong&gt;, and can’t be
flanked. Its &lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Fury&lt;/strong&gt; also gives it an extra standard action per turn
while it’s bloodied, even when it’s dazed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combat, the Opener of the Way projects Reach 4 &lt;strong&gt;Tentacles&lt;/strong&gt; to attack, which
deal light physical damage and restrain for a turn on a hit. It can use them in
a &lt;strong&gt;Triple Attack&lt;/strong&gt; to strike three times in a standard action, and it can
enhance a tentacle attack with a &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Boost&lt;/strong&gt; similar to that of the star
spawn in this entry. Aside from the boost recharging when Allabar takes psychic
damage, it also recharges when the star succeeds with its &lt;strong&gt;Devour Body&lt;/strong&gt;
attack. This Close Burst 1 vs. Fortitude targets creatures who are at 0 HP or
lower. On a hit, it kills the target and pulls it inside Allabar. It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;
target dead allies, but it’s also excellent for making PCs exercise those “when
you die” abilities they surely have by now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another very interesting attack is &lt;strong&gt;Wrath of the Forsaken World&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast
5 vs. Fortitude, recharge 5+), which deals psychic damage and causes each target
to sprout a hostile tentacle (save ends). While the tentacle is there, it deals
an automatic 20 damage to any target that ends their turn within 2 squares of
the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, you know, no big deal, the Opener can use &lt;strong&gt;Unravel Essence&lt;/strong&gt;
(melee 4 vs. Fortitude), which inflicts 20 ongoing damage on a hit (save
ends). On the first failed save, this increases to 25. On the second, the target
also becomes weakened and insubstantial. On the third, the target drops to 0 HP
if its HP was still positive. A successful save at any point halts the process
and clears all related conditions. This recharges whenever there are no
creatures affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, when someone hits Allabar with an attack, it can cause &lt;strong&gt;Psychic
Feedback&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction, automatically dazing the attacker (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allabar is very intelligent and will work to maximize its advantages, abusing
its flight and superior reach, and focusing fire make them drop to 0 HP quickly
so they can be devoured. And if your level 30 PCs are cocky because this end
boss is “only” level 30, add a few Emissaries of Caiphon to make it impossible
for them to pass the many saves imposed by the Opener of the Way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awesome continues! This entry does return to the old standby of “tentacles”,
but the monsters are still pretty evocative and their mechanics
interesting. Allabar reminds me of Atropus, from Elder Evils, but it’s has more
of an aberrant/psychic theme instead of Atropus’ undead/necrotic leanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Opener of the Way is the fourth and last epic boss to be found in this
book. The previous ones were Imix, Lolth, and Ogrémoch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Spider</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only have monstrous spiders been in the game since the beginning, they’ve
been on every monster book we read so far. The MM3 is no exception in this
case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like the Web Walk trait was a &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2021/01/05/spider.html&quot;&gt;Monster Vault&lt;/a&gt; innovation. The spiders
in the MM3 don’t have it, but it would make sense for them to do so. They do
already use fixed math, like the other monsters in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All spiders here have a climb speed equal to their ground speed, with the Spider
Climb keyword to signal that they can also walk on ceilings. They also have
Tremorsense 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ambush-spider&quot;&gt;Ambush Spider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to go back to basics, and you can’t get any more basic than
this. These Medium natural spiders behave much like mundane trapdoor spiders,
using webs to camouflage their hidey-holes and charging out of them to bite and
inject venom into their prey. As Level 2 Lurkers with 28 HP, they’re likely the
first giant spider any group of adventures is going to face. I’m surprised
something like this only showed up in the MM3. Their speed is a breezy 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spider’s &lt;strong&gt;Camouflage&lt;/strong&gt; trait allows it to hide when it has only partial
cover or concealment. Its basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;, but it turns into a
&lt;strong&gt;Venomous Bite&lt;/strong&gt; if made against a creature the spider is hidden from. This
does the same damage and can be used in a charge. It also slows the target and
inflicts 5 ongoing poison damage (save ends). This worsens to immobilized after
the first failed save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spiderling&quot;&gt;Spiderling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spiderlings are immature giant spiders, merely Small in size. This is a generic
stat block that can be used to represent youngsters of any of the spider species
presented here or elsewhere. They’re Level 4 Minion Skirmishers with Speed 6 and
a basic bite attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack deals only 2 poison damage, but it also gives poison vulnerability 5
to the target for a turn. If the target is already vulnerable to poison their
vulnerability increases by 2 instead. This means that multiple spiderling bites
on the same victim add up very fast, particularly if the adults join in at the
end. You can vary their level based on the expected level of the adult
specimens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;feyspitter-spider&quot;&gt;Feyspitter Spider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spider native to the Feywild produces a venom laced with psychedelic
fairy-tale qualities. Aside from the usual physiological damage, it also forces
its victims to dance uncontrolably! Over time, feyspitter hunting grounds come
to look like clearings where the vegetation has been stomped flat by all the
dancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feyspitters are Medium Fey Beasts and Level 7 Controllers with 80 HP and a Speed
of 6. Their &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; deals physical damage and inflicts 5 ongoing poison damage
(save ends). Each time the victim fails a save, the spider can slide them 3
squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also use &lt;strong&gt;Poison Spittle&lt;/strong&gt; to spray their venom in a Close
Blast 3. This deams 10 ongoing poison damage on everyone it hits, with the same
sliding effect on each failed save. Finally, if hit in melee, feyspitters can
use a &lt;strong&gt;Fey Leap&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) to teleport 3 squares as an interrupt. Yes,
this means they can jump out of melee range and negate any damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lolths-reaver&quot;&gt;Lolth’s Reaver&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another epic level spider directly associated with Lolth. These spiders don’t
exist in the wild. Instead, they’re bred by Lolth’s worshippers and fed the
blood of elves, eladrin and angels from an early age. Their upbringing makes
them sapient and Chaotic Evil. They commonly serve as mounts for Abyssal Drow,
and can also be found as pets and guardians in Lolth’s mightiest temples
elsewhere in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reavers are Large Elemental Beasts with the Mount and Spider keywords. They’re
Level 25 Brutes with 287 HP. They have a ground speed of 8, but their Climb
speed is only 6. Their mount trait is &lt;strong&gt;Web Saddle&lt;/strong&gt;, which prevents their rider
from being involuntarily dismounted by forced movement. I never even knew this
was a possibility for anyone else, so I find this very interesting. Enough PCs
have easy access to forced movement that staying mounted might very well be a
problem for an enemy rider in most situations. Not here, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reavers fight with their extremely venomous &lt;strong&gt;bites&lt;/strong&gt;, which deal light physical
damage and inflict 20 ongoing poison damage (save ends). They can shoot
&lt;strong&gt;Grasping Threads&lt;/strong&gt; at range, which deal no damage but pull the target 5
squares and restrain them (save ends). Each failed saving throw causes the
reaver to pull the target an additional 5 squares. There is no hard limit on the
number of targets that can be restrained in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter the reaver can perform a &lt;strong&gt;Web Leap&lt;/strong&gt;, jumping 8 squares
without provoking opportunity attacks and spreaying a Close Blast 3 with sticky
webs when they land. This does heavy physical damage, knocks its targets prone,
and prevents them from standing up (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spider-webs&quot;&gt;Spider Webs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a monster, but a side box with example terrain features based on
spider webs. All of the spiders in this entry and most of the ones in previous
books are web-spinners, so these should see heavy usage in arachnid-themed
dungeons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These hazards have variable DCs and attack rolls based on their level, which
should be similar to that of the overall encounter. The more badass the spider,
the more badass its webs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Sheets&lt;/strong&gt; are nearly invisible vertical webs, usually placed across
passages and corridors. Spotting them requires a Perception test against the
hard DC for their level. When someone enters their space, they attack the
victim’s Reflex and immobilize them (save ends). A close or area fire attack
destroys the whole web, a melee fire attack destroys one square of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cobwebs&lt;/strong&gt; are thick and opaque sheets of webbing covering walls, floors, and
ceilings. Spiders use these for concealment, hiding behind them until it’s time
to burst out and strike. They provide total concealment, and spiders can usually
perceive enemies through them using tremorsense. They might also count as
difficult terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re starting to repeat ourselves a bit with all these spiders, but it’s nice
to see a low-level example. I also really liked the Feyspitter for its dancing
venom.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Orchard of Time</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting dream recently that gave me what I think is a neat idea for
a dungeon location: The Orchard of Time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s started out as your standard divine orchard, a bit like the Garden of the
Hesperides. It was owned and operated by a powerful spirit or minor deity, and
its trees gave fruit that ranged from “mundane but high-quality” to “outright
miraculous” the further in you went. If you got to the very center, you could
harvest the Peaches of Immortality or something equally awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something happened to the Orchard’s original owners and they left, abandoning
the place. Monstrous fauna from the surrounding regions moved in and either
overwhelmed the previous guardians or entered some sort of symbiosis with
them. These new monsters found ample food in the trees of the Orchard, whose
energies mutated them to be larger and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, a powerful arch-wizard found the Orchard’s location and decided to go
for the Peaches. This extremely arrogant individual was sure he would succeed
where all others have failed. After all, the others weren’t him! He armed
himself with his best spells and his best magic items, and teleported to the
Orchard’s entrance (can’t teleport into it from outside). Then he boldly strode
past the gate, and cast his most powerful magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a custom spell that would stop time everywhere in the Orchard except
for an area five meters or so in radius around the wizard himself. The idea was
that, with time stoped, the archmage could just walk up to the really good trees
in the center while dodging the place’s many inhabitants. If he needed to remove
any of them, he could bring them into the “active time” circle and use his other
magic to handle them one individual or small group at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the wizard’s hubris got the better of him at exactly the worst
time. Maybe he had miscalculated when creating the spell, or maybe he made a
critical error when casting it. The fact is that our wizard just
kinda… exploded, leaving behind only his ornate metal staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, the spell itself worked exactly as planned. Even better in fact, as
the same error that deleted our wizard made it last forever. It’s centered on
the wizard’s staff, which stands planted on the ground just inside the Orchard’s
entrance gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;layout-and-hazards&quot;&gt;Layout and Hazards&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orchard is located in a hidden valley and is bordered by tall forested
mountains. The climate can range from temperate to tropical depending on what
kind of fruit you want it to contain. As mentioned above, vestigial divine wards
prevent people from finding it with divination or from teleporting into it from
outside. It can still be found via good old-fashioned research, as its location
is recorded in ancient religious texts and in the unfortunate wizard’s own
notes. The wizard has also helpfully dispelled any magical defenses that
prevented people from just walking through the main gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Orchard of Time was a little overgrown from its period of abandonment, but
still retains its characteristic layout. There are many trees but they’re spaced
far apart. Cobbled paths wind their way among them. Grass and other wild plants
reach up to a human’s knees between the trees and paths. This space used to be
taken up by a lawn and flower beds, but these have been overwhelmed by native
plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that despite covering a very large area, the Orchard has excellent
sight lines and a clearly navigable layout. You can see a good deal of its
significant landmarks from the entrance gate and it’s impossible to get lost
inside. These excellent sight lines work against intruders such as the PCs,
because they allow the many, many monsters and guardians that live here to see
them from far away. These creatures are all hostile, territorial, and generally
incapable of dialogue either because they have animal intellect or because
they’re some sort of construct. In the dream I had these monsters definitely
included a variety of Rodents of Unusual Size. There are almost more monsters
than there are fruit, and they all more or less converge on the location of any
intruders they can perceive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or they &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt;, if time hadn’t stopped inside. The wizard’s staff is just
inside the entrance, and it projects a field of “normal time” in a 5-meter
radius around itself. Everything outside this bubble and inside the orchard’s
outer walls is frozen in time, and has been for a long time (decades?
centuries?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs who want to succeed where the arrogant wizard failed need to carry the staff
with them. Getting close enough to a monster that it enters the “bubble” will
unfreeze the creature, and it will imediately attack. There might be a route
that allows them to avoid most of the creatures, but not all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the copious monsters, the permanent time stop might have created
hazardous areas inside the Orchard, where space or time itself behave in harmful
ways. These might be almost impossible to detect until they’re inside the active
time bubble, which would make them reveal themselves in a dramatic fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-go-there&quot;&gt;Why go there?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious reason to delve the Orchard of Time is to get its most awesome
fruits from the big trees at the center, like the wizard wanted to do. The
Orchard might also contain buildings of interest (such as libraries or treasure
vaults), along with the bodies of ancient adventurers who tried to delve the
place before the ill-fated wizard. Some of these might be legendary themselves,
and have died carrying their equally legendary gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slightly alternate Orchard would have been invaded by the wizard while it was
still operational! In this case it’s going to be in pristine condition, with all
of its original guardians and security systems still in place. Even its &lt;em&gt;owners&lt;/em&gt;
will still be around, frozen in time like flies in amber. Freeing them is an
excellent goal for more heroic sorts, or at least for sorts who need the
specific help whose divine entities are able to provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since those owners are frozen in time, they’re still going to be under
the impression that they’re being invaded by a cheeky wizard. And look at you,
carrying his staff around like that. Better talk fast!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the Monster Manual 3: Spawn of Kyuss</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spawn of Kyuss were introduced in the Age of Worms adventure path,
originally published in Dungeon Magazine in 2005-2006, when it was run by
Paizo. Some of Kyuss’ most powerful servants were reprinted in the Elder Evils
supplement for 3.5e, and later got conversion stats in an early 4th edition web
enhancement file. This means this is technically not the Spawn’s 4e debut, but
it is the first time we get complete lore and lower-than-epic stats for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ancient times, Kyuss was a mortal magician and a charismatic cult leader, who
led his followers to a remote jungle region in order to establish a base. There,
he found ruins from an even more ancient pre-human civilization. With the
knowledge he learned from those ruins, the cultist sacrificed his followers in a
ritual to become a giant undead demigod whose body was made out of bright green
worms. The Worm that Walks spent a long time imprisoned outside the world, but
the prophecy of the Age of Worms foretells that he will return and devour the
world in what is basically a worm-fueled zombie apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Spawn of Kyuss are undead created by infecting corpses with worms plucked
from his own body. They’re easily distinguished by the wriggling mass of green
worms crawling all over them, inside and outside. They’re Kyuss’ agents in the
world and their presence presages his return. Even if the Worm’s return is not
imminent, these creatures might still be found performing some task that
furthers their patron’s interests, whether by themselves or allied with
cultists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first Spawn were Kyuss’ original followers, sacrificed in that first
ritual. Making new ones is a matter of performing a simple worm transplant from
a spawn to an available body, living or dead. The ones listed here are not
particularly smart, but it’s worth remembering that &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/06/21/larva-mage.html&quot;&gt;Larva Mages&lt;/a&gt; are also
the spawn of Kyuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get three varieties of Spawn here, all suitable as threats to Paragon-tier
parties. They’re Medium Natural Animates with a Speed of 5 and Darkvision, plus
the usual undead traits: immunity to disease and poison, a resistance to
necrotic damage, and a vulnerability to radiant damage. They’re also vulnerable
to fire - it burns the worms right up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the spawn here can also transmit the Touch of Kyuss, which is basically
an infestation of evil supernatural worms. It’s treated as a Level 16 disease
resisted with Endurance (DC 25 to improve or 20 to maintain). Stage 1 makes the
victim regain only half hit points from spending healing surges, and causes them
to rise as wretches of Kyuss if they die. Stage 2 causes them to lose 2 healing
surges, and if they ever reach 0 surges they die and rise as Sons of
Kyuss. Stage 3 cuts to the chase and kills the victim right away so it can rise
as a Son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;son-of-kyuss&quot;&gt;Son of Kyuss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things look like zombies at a first glance, but they’re sapient and much
stronger. Their goal is to usually spread the “blessing” of Kyuss to as many
living people as they can. Though they’re not exactly geniuses at Int 6, they
can and will coordinate in order to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sons of Kyuss are Level 13 Brutes with 158 HP. They project a &lt;strong&gt;Fear of Worms&lt;/strong&gt;
aura which inflicts a -2 attack penalty to living creatures inside. Their basic
attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and exposes the target to the Touch of
Kyuss. It can also “shoot” &lt;strong&gt;Burrowing Worms&lt;/strong&gt; in a Close Burst 1 (recharge
5+). A hit inflicts 10 ongoing damage, increasing to 15 on the first failed save
and to 20 plus stun on the second. If someone dies from this they immediately
rise as a wretch of Kyuss (see below). The wretch must be destroyed before the
victim can be raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wretch-of-kyuss&quot;&gt;Wretch of Kyuss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An undead creature with a lower worm content than a full Son of Kyuss. It’s less
sturdy but still quite dangerous and quite contagious, being a Level 13 Minion
Brute. Its &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; deals light necrotic damage, and when it dies it bursts,
inflicting necrotic damage in a Close Burst 1 and exposing anyone hit by this
attack to the Touch of Kyuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;herald-of-kyuss&quot;&gt;Herald of Kyuss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These undead abomination were created from the bodies of angels sent by the gods
to stop the Worm that Walks. They’re Medium Immortal Animates (undead), and have
all the same traits as the other spawn. Also, they can fly at speed 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Herald is a Level 16 Artillery monster with 116 HP. They have the same Fear
of Worms aura as the Son, plus a &lt;strong&gt;Writhing Host&lt;/strong&gt; aura of the same size that
deals 10 necrotic damage to enemies caught inside. All of their attacks expose
the target to the Touch of Kyuss on a hit, making them the most contagious spawn
of all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic melee attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Rotting Caress&lt;/strong&gt; that deals necrotic
damage. They can attack at range by making &lt;strong&gt;Writhing Pronouncements&lt;/strong&gt; that deal
immediate and ongoing 5 necrotic damage. This worsens to 10 and a daze on the
first failed save, and to 15 and a stun on the second (save ends). People killed
by this turn into wretches of Kyuss, which must be destroyed before the victims
can be raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter they can call an &lt;strong&gt;Eruption of Maggots&lt;/strong&gt; that acts as a
disgusting fireball-sized area attack. It deals immediate and ongoing necrotic
damage, and also creates a damaging zone that lasts for the rest of the
encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ewwww. Kill these with fire as soon as possible. If your GM is re-enacting the
Age of Worms campaign, you can expect to run into these things very often. Their
main gimmick is all about infecting people with the Touch of Kyuss, so PCs can
expect to stop and cast Remove Affliction more or less after every fight unless
they’re under extreme time pressure. Stage 1 is already a major debuff, and
staying at Stage 2 is a serious gamble.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Slaad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaads have appeared in every 4e Monster Manual so far. This one gives us more
exotic varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic slaad lore remains the same: technically sapient frog-like monsters from
the Elemental Chaos with lolrandom minds and a propensity to implant eggs into
other creatures. You can see the lore specific to each new variety in their
descriptions below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, chaos phage is a level 16 disease that represents being implanted
with a slaad egg. Stage 1 has no effect beyond this, stage 2 gives you a Will
penalty and makes you attack randomly while bloodied, stage 3 means the embryo
bursts out of your skull and kills you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other diseases it’s not hard to remove with the right ritual, but the
symptoms are severe enough that you’ll want to do it sooner rather than
later. And as usual the ritual takes time and costs a bunch of healing surges,
so it’s something that might add time pressure to a slaad focused adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;golden-slaad&quot;&gt;Golden Slaad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-slaad-golden.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaads are mostly immune to the chaos storms that often rage through portions of
the Elemental Chaos, which is why they like to follow these storms around. When
one of these storms manages to affect a slaad, it can mutate it into a golden
slaad. Golden Slaads are revered by their chromatic brethren, who follow them
around as if they were a chaos storm themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golden slaads are even more chaos-infused than their relatives, and can inject
that raw chaos in any victims they bite. Their gold-colored forms are unstable,
and if they’re wounded they became unable to sustain those forms, becoming
quivering (but still dangerous!) piles of ooze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures are Huge Elemental Humanoids and Level 20 Controllers with 193
HP. They have a ground speed of 8 and a teleport speed of 6, as well as
low-light vision and an immunity to chaos phage (like all slaads).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; is reach 3 and deals physical damage, with a random rider
depending on the result of the attack roll. If the roll is odd, it slides the
target 3 squares. If it’s even, it dazes them for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also emit &lt;strong&gt;Chaos Croaks&lt;/strong&gt; in a Close Burst 5 (recharge 5+). This
targets Will, does psychic damage, and has a random rider rolled on a d6 table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target is teleported 1d6 squares in a random direction (rolled on a d8).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target makes a melee basic attack against a random creature adjacent to it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target is stunned for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target is slowed (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target takes an extra 10 damage of a random elemental type rolled on a d10.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target is exposed to chaos phage, and if it was dazed by the slad it becomes
stunned instead (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the slaad is first bloodied it suffers an &lt;strong&gt;Amniotic Transformation&lt;/strong&gt; and
becomes an ooze. It becomes unable to teleport and its speed drops to 4, but it
gains a &lt;strong&gt;Corrosive Pseudopodia&lt;/strong&gt; attack that can be used as an opportunity
action against any adjacent enemy who moves or makes an attack. It deals minor
acid damage and grabs the target on a hit. With a minor action, the slaad can
sustian all of its grabs, deal acid damage to the victims, and regain 5 HP per
grabbed victim. So the loss of speed isn’t that crippling, because the slaad now
&lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; people to get adjacent to it. And it still retains the use of its other
attacks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putrid-slaad&quot;&gt;Putrid Slaad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an undead slaad. While it’s most often created on purpose by powerful
necromancers, it can also arise naturally when a slaad dies in the Abyss. These
“natural” putrid slaads have a tendency to obey demon lords, so you bet Orcus
loves them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The putrid slaad loses its ability to spread chaos phage, but it still fights
very similarly to a living one. It will even eat its victims. The remains rot
inside its non-functional guts, and then the monster vomits them when it attacks
its &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putrid Slaads are Large Elemental Animates (Undead), and Level 19 Brutes with
227 HP. Its basic &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack pulls the target 1 square, and &lt;strong&gt;Graping
Claws&lt;/strong&gt; allows it to make 2 of those with a single action. If both attacks hit,
the slaad grabs the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the putrid slaad has grabbed someone, it will hit them with its &lt;strong&gt;Horrific
Spew&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 6), which deals both immediate and ongoing acid and necrotic
damage (save ends). The spew can also be used as a Close Blast 3 attack, but it
has a +2 to-hit bonus when focused on the grabbed victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slaad can also &lt;strong&gt;cast aside&lt;/strong&gt; its grabbed victim, pushing them 5 squares,
dealing some automatic physical damage to the victim, and using it to make an
area attack against anyone adjacent to the victim when it lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-impressions&quot;&gt;Personal Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More slaads. As far as late-edition slaads go, these are pretty cool
mechanically. Golden Slaads finally deliver the promised dose of pure chaos
people expect when they first read the slaad’s basic lore, and putrid slaads
have this cool cycle of grabbing people and tossing them aside, with an
occasional dose of disgusting barf.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Skulk</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-skulk.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skulks first appeared on the AD&amp;amp;D Fiend Folio. This is their 4e debut, with
all-new lore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centuries ago, the human empire of Bael Turath fought a dreadful war against the
dragonborn empire of Arkhosia. Bael Turath was never a nice place: its society
was severely stratified, and its ruling nobles were slavers that spared little
thought to those they enslaved. When it found itself losing the war against
Arkhosia, those same ruling nobles did not hesitate to turn to Hell for help,
and forged the diabolic pact that would see them and their descendants
transformed into tieflings. We’ve seen all of this before, and we also know that
the pact didn’t help them in the end. Bael Turath fell just the same, with the
pact’s boon at most allowing them to take Arkhosia with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this entry we see one of the reasons why it fell. The pact for infernal power
excluded Bael Turath’s large enslaved population, even as it lowered the
slavers’ guard. There was a huge rebellion where many of Bael Turath’s noble
caste were murdered in their sleep. Some of the rebels did this to escape their
bonds, but some did it because they were angry at being excluded from the
infernal pact. The Demon Prince Graz’zt was impressed with the latter and
reached out to them to offer his patronage. Those who accepted became the
creatures known as skulks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skulks are sapient humanoids with a supernatural affinity for
stealth. Ironically enough, they are much more indebted to their demon patron
than modern-day tieflings are to whatever devil mutated their ancestors. This
eternal debt is encoded in a document known as the &lt;em&gt;Book of the Blinded Eye&lt;/em&gt;,
and it bids even present-day skulks to follow the orders of Graz’zt’s
servants. They’re often sent out as assassins to eliminate threats to the cult
or their demon master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skulks’ hatred of tieflings is equally eternal, and probably also enforced
by the demonic pact. Skulks live as if Bael Turath never fell, and as if they’re
still infiltrated behind enemy lines. Left to their own devices, they will
pursue their original mission of murdering all tieflings. They spread along with
the tiefling diaspora as the latter fled their fallen empire. Any present-day
settlement that contains a sizable tiefling population is also likely to contain
a skulk population preying on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book paints all skulks with this demonic brush, but it would be simple to
say only a small percentage of them are this horrible, just like only a small
percentage of tieflings are diabolists. As with most other humanoid entries, you
can treat this one describing the form skulk &lt;em&gt;villains&lt;/em&gt; usually take, and not as
a species-wide portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine non-evil skulks would simply be reclusive and wish to be left alone,
either living in their own isolated communities or still “infiltrating” those of
others but without trying to murder anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skulks are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 6 and Low-Light
Vision. Their signature trait is Stealthy Step, which exempts them from the
Stealth penalty for moving more than 2 squares per turn or for running. All of
the individual entries have additional stealth powers beyond that, appropriate
to their role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entries here are appropriate threats for an early-to-mid-Heroic party. More
powerful skulks up to epic tier certainly exist, but are left as an exercise to
the GM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skulk-mesmerist&quot;&gt;Skulk Mesmerist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spellcaster specializing in charm and illusion magic. It’s a Level 3
Controller with 45 HP. Mesmerists fight with a &lt;strong&gt;short sword&lt;/strong&gt; and have a couple
of active attack powers. The first is &lt;strong&gt;Luring Charm&lt;/strong&gt;, a non-damaging ranged
attack that targets Will, slides the target 4 squares, and dazes then for a
turn. The other is &lt;strong&gt;Mesmerize&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) a ranged attack that targets
Will, deals psychic damage, and makes the target unable to see any enemies other
than the mesmerist themselves (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, they can also use &lt;strong&gt;Deceptive Veil&lt;/strong&gt; to look like any Medium
or Small humanoid. Piercing the illusion requires a DC 26 Insight check, which
is very hard even for a dedicated PC at this level. This is actually more
powerful than the Changeling’s disguise ability, since it also allows the
mesmerist to look like a Small humanoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skulk Mesmerists like to kill two birds with one stone by murdering a target
while looking like someone they want to frame for that murder. Their Veil also
makes it possible for the GM to make an adventure where an innocent changeling
is charged for a string of murders perpetrated by a skulk mesmerist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skulk-murderer&quot;&gt;Skulk Murderer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one does what it says on the tin. Over and over and over. It’s a Level 3
Lurker with 37 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the standard Stealthy Step trait, the murderer also has &lt;strong&gt;Peerless
Camouflage&lt;/strong&gt; that allows it to hide while it only has partial cover or
concealment, and to remain hidden if it still has cover or concealment at the
end of a movement. It also has &lt;strong&gt;Unseen Strike&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets it deal extra
damage against targets that couldn’t see at the start of its turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The murderer fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Short sword&lt;/strong&gt; and can thrown a &lt;strong&gt;Shuriken Volley&lt;/strong&gt;
once per encounter. This lets it make three ranged attacks, which deal a bit of
damage and immobilize (save ends) on a hit. All of these can benefit from Unseen
Strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When playing one of these, you want to start the fight hidden and open it with a
Shuriken Volley. Then you alternate between re-establishing stealth and striking
with the sword. A mesmerist in the same team as the murder makes it a lot more
dangerous, because now the murderer doesn’t need to waste time hiding to benefit
from Unseen Strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skulk-hunter&quot;&gt;Skulk Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another stealthy killer, but this one is a Level 5 Soldier with 61 HP. It fights
with a longsword, and even its basic attack is funny: it’s called &lt;strong&gt;Baffling
Blade&lt;/strong&gt;, and it if hits it allows the hunter to stay hidden from the target. Its
special attack is the &lt;strong&gt;Invisible Blade&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), which targets someone
who can’t see the hunter, deals double damage, and inflicts ongoing 5 damage
(save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both attacks mark the target as an effect, and if an enemy marked by the hunter
shifts the hunter gets to use Baffling Blade against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunters also go very well with mesmerists: the mesmerist can make them invisible
to a PC while they set up as the traditional front line preventing the PC from
reaching the mesmerist. They can use Invisible Blade against the afflicted
victim without having to hide, and they can also hide without having to leave
formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the lore entry, I like this entry much better if I read it as
describing the typical skulk &lt;em&gt;villain&lt;/em&gt; instead of describing the typical
&lt;em&gt;skulk&lt;/em&gt;. Mechanically, I like how the three stat blocks synergize - they’re
clearly meant to be used together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied monsters might include Graz’zt cultists and minor demons. Anything that
can make their monster buddies invisible also works really well with skulks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Shardmind</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-shardmind.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shardminds made their debut as a playable option in the Player’s Handbook 3 for
4e. They’re new to this edition and really lean into its background lore for
psionics. They also have the honor of being the second living construct species
presented in the game (after Warforged). This entry presents some shardmind stat
blocks for use as NPCs or enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the dawn of time there was a crystaline entity named the Living Gate. Neither
god nor primordial, the Gate protected the border between the known planes and
the Far Realm. It stood firm even during the Dawn War, but it was eventually
sundered by the combined efforts of mind flayers, beholders and other Far Realm
inhabitants who wanted to enter the world for reasons ranging from the
inscrutable to the foul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Living Gate was shattered and its pieces spread through the cosmos,
its will lived on, gifting the disparate shards with life and purpose. These are
the shardminds, living constructs with a strong affinity for psionic power and
ancestral memories that compel them to rebuild the Living Gate and once again
seal the Far Realm away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that common ancestral memory shardminds as individuals are as varied in
outlook and personality as any other sapient species. Over the ages they have
formed three major schools of thought that propose different ways of continuing
the mission of the Living Gate. The MM3 doesn’t describe all of them, but I will
because they’re cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Thought Builders&lt;/strong&gt; believe the correct solution is to build a new Living
Gate and imbue it with the psionic power necessary to seal the Far Realm. Their
main goal is to acquire the knowledge necessary to do so. They tend to be Good
and worship Ioun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The God Shards&lt;/strong&gt; believe that the Shardminds now form a distributed network
that carries on the duties of the Living Gate. It’s each individual’s duty to
train and nurture their own power so that they can better contribute to this
task. Once this network is strong enough, the Far Realm will be sealed. They
tend to be Unaligned and worship no gods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Shard Slayers&lt;/strong&gt; are the faction most likely to come into conflict with the
PCs. They believe that the original Living Gate can rebuild itself if it’s
psionic energy is allowed to return to its original site. However, this energy
is “trapped” in the shardminds, and must be forcibly “released”. So yeah,
adherents of this philosophy want to kill all other shardminds and then
themselves. They are usually Evil and worship Vecna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stat blocks in this entry represent Shard Slayers suitable as mid-to-late
Heroic opposition. If your group has one or more shardminds, they have a
built-in reason to be hostile. Even if it doesn’t, most non-Evil PCs will be
interested in stopping a bunch of genocidal maniacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shardminds are Immortal Humanoids with the Living Construct keyword. They have
Resist 5 Psychic and a ground speed of 6. Their signature power is the same one
PCs get: &lt;strong&gt;Shardswarm&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter power which allows them to break apart and
reform a short distance away. This causes every adjacent enemy to grant combat
advantage for a turn and lets the shardmind teleport half their speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shardminds speak Common, Deep Speech, and have telepathy with range 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shardmind-warseeker&quot;&gt;Shardmind Warseeker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-shardmind-jasper.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This psychic warrior disguises its true nature beneath a suit of plate, and
wanders about seeking shardminds to slay. Its outwardly calm demeanor hides a
murderous rage, which reveals itself when it’s wounded in combat or when an
innocent bystander fails to answer its questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warseeker is a Level 6 Soldier with 70 HP. It wears plate and fights with a
broadsword and a heavy crossbow. Heavy armor means its speed is only 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;crossbow&lt;/strong&gt; are basic attacks that damage and mark
for a turn. If a marked enemy within 5 squares of the warseeker targets makes an
attack that doesn’t target it, the warseeker can deal 5 psychic damage to that
enemy. Once the warseeker is bloodied, its &lt;strong&gt;Furious Mind&lt;/strong&gt; grants it 10
temporary HP, a -2 penalty to AC, and a +4 bonus to damage for the rest of the
fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a basic frontline fighter with some tricks borrowed from the paladin and
the barbarian. It’s sticky and a good choice to form a solid “wall” with other
soldiers and brutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shardmind-dominator&quot;&gt;Shardmind Dominator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A psion who is a big fan of mind control. It’s a Level 8 Controller with 86
HP. It wields a &lt;strong&gt;dagger&lt;/strong&gt; as a basic melee attack, but the important bits are
its powers geared towards brute-force mind control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overwhelming Mind&lt;/strong&gt; is an at-will power that only has an “Effect” line,
meaning this always happens: it forces an enemy within 5 squares to make a melee
or ranged basic attack against a target of the dominator’s choice. If the attack
hits, the dominator slides the enemy 3 squares. &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Puppet&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+)
is a non-damaging ranged attck that dominates the target on a hit (save
ends). And &lt;strong&gt;Mind Swarm&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) is an area attack that deals psychic
damage and creates a zone that lasts the rest of the encounter. Enemies who end
their turn inside can be slid 3 squares by the dominator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dominators will be doing little damage on their own, but they’ll cause lots of
friendly fire incidents and will make it very hard for the party to maintain any
sort of coherent formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shardmind-executioner&quot;&gt;Shardmind Executioner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Bort, from Land of the Lustrous.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A skilled assassin dispatched to murder shardminds identified by its
buddies. It’s a Level 10 Lurker with 81 HP, wielding a crystal greatsword called
a &lt;strong&gt;Shardblade&lt;/strong&gt;. It does standard damage for its level, which can be increased
by the &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Boost&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+). This is a free-action power that
triggers when the executioner hits with the sword, so it’s never wasted on a
missed attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executioner attacks a range with a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; power, which deals light
psychic damage and blinds the target for a turn. It can also perform a &lt;strong&gt;Psychic
Infiltration&lt;/strong&gt;, a melee attack vs. Will. On a hit this removes the executioner
from play and causes the target to suffer 20 ongoing psychic damage and be dazed
(save ends). When the target saves, the executioner appears adjacent to it. This
is an at-will power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A boosted sword strike actually deals more damage than a round of Infiltration,
but the latter is an excellent move to use while Psychic Boost recharges, as it
shields the shardmind from damage. So this lurker actually hides inside the
enemy’s minds, and deals massive damage while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love all the living constructs, and shardminds are no exception. Their default
appearance is a bit meh, but as you can see by the illustrations I chose here
this can be easily remedied.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Shadow</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-shadow.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadows have been in the game since the beginning. They were usually undead in
previous editions, but here they get a bit of new lore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s understandable that someone would think shadows are undead, but the truth
is that they are a species of creature native to the Shadowfell. They’re
sapient but they perceive the world in a way that makes then inimical to most
other living creatures. They hate light, and believe the shadows cast by living
creatures to be prisoners in cages of flesh. Many seek to rescue these prisoners
by destroying their cages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadows might form alliances of convenience with other people that would offer
them the chance to “liberate” lots of living creatures, but they rarely care for
the causes or gods of us fleshlings. The exception seems to be spellcasters
versed in shadow magic, who can summon them very easily and always find them to
be obsequious and eager servants. It’s almost like the shadows know something
that these mortal masters don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadows slip into the world via these summonings or at natural contact points
between the world and the Shadowfell. Their number has increased in recent
years, but no one knows why yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadows are Medium Shadow Humanoids with a ground speed of 8 and
Darkvision. They’re insubstantial but vulnerable to radiant damage. Exposure to
ambient light doesn’t damage them, but reveals their position and leaves them
with less places to hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their signature trait is &lt;strong&gt;Born of Shadows&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows them to make Stealth
checks to hide mid-combat when they have any amount of concealment, instead of
needing total concealment. All of the variants here are trained in Stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shadow-stalker&quot;&gt;Shadow Stalker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is equivalent to the classic shadows of editions past. It’s a Level 3
Lurker with 25 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stalker attacks with a &lt;strong&gt;shadowy touch&lt;/strong&gt; that does necrotic damage, and it
has a &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Stalk&lt;/strong&gt; power that deals necrotic damage and allows it to meld
with an enemy’s shadow (save ends). While melded, the shadow moves in lockstep
with its victim, without provoking opportunity attacks. It gains a +4 to all
defenses and a +5 to attack the victim. When the victim saves, the shadow
appears on an adjacent square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its triggered action is &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Step&lt;/strong&gt;: when a nearby creature drops to 0 HP,
the stalked teleports to an adjacent square and gains a +2 bonus to attacks for
a turn (from eating the victim’s shadow). This also recharges Shadow Stalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow Stalkers become major threats if they manage to land their Shadow Stalk
attack. Its buddies should focus fire on the stricken PC, which increases the
chances of the PC dropping to 0 HP and recharging the power. Note that it’s
possible for multiple stalkers to meld with the same PC’s shadow, and that the
attack also recharges if an &lt;em&gt;enemy&lt;/em&gt; hits 0 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs should focus their fire on any shadow stalkers in Team Monster, preferrably
with radiant and force attacks to kill them quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shadow-strangler&quot;&gt;Shadow Strangler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a spellcaster specializing in remote shadow control. It uses the shadows
it devours to fuel its magic, so it must feed more frequently than its
fellows. Stranglers are Level 9 Artillery with 53 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strangler’s &lt;strong&gt;shadowy touch&lt;/strong&gt; deals necrotic damage and makes invisible to
the target for a turn. Its basic ranged attack is a spell namd &lt;strong&gt;Blinding
Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; that deals the same amount of necrotic damage and makes the target
unable to see further than 3 squares for a turn. Its special attack is
&lt;strong&gt;Strangling Darkness&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) which restrains and deals ongoing 15
damage (save ends). And finally it has an encounter power named &lt;strong&gt;Devouring
Dark&lt;/strong&gt; that’s basically a “shadow fireball” that deals light necrotic damage and
blinds everyone it hits for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being artillery, stranglers are very controllery. They pair well with
lurkers whose increased damage depends on combat advantage or on being unseen by
their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shadow-puppeteer&quot;&gt;Shadow Puppeteer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This powerful shadow has a more refined palate. It seeks to feed on the shadows
cast by souls as they depart for the afterlife. So while the others might leave
their victims a bit drained but alive, this one is definitely out for murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppeteers are Level 14 Lurkers with 74 HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;shadowy touch&lt;/strong&gt; deals extra
damage against targets that cannot see it, and creates a zone of lightly
obscured squares centered on the target’s space that lasts for a turn. Its
special attak is &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Puppet&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets a creature that cannot see the
puppeteer, deals light necrotic damage, and dominates them until they start
their turn not adjacent to the shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppeteers and stranglers have amazing synergy. If you want your PCs to sweat
for their victory, it’s definitely worth it to adjust their levels so they’re
closer to each other and can be included in the same encounter. Keep the
strangler as the lower-level half of the pair to make things slightly less hard
for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs fighting a puppeteer should remain mobile to avoid lingering in the darkness
it creates, and should use forced movement powers to keep it away from potential
domination targets. If they face the tag team described above, they should focus
on killing the strangler first, since it frees the puppeteer from having to set
up its lurker bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadows don’t usually work well with other monsters, so you’re most likely
looking at all-shadow teams when building encounters. If you want more variety
it might be possible to turn another monster into a shadow by changing its
origin, halving its HP, making it insubstantial, and making its basic attack
into a touch that targets Reflex and deals necrotic damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original reason shadows were scary was that they drained Strength, but here
they’re scary because they’re &lt;em&gt;sticky&lt;/em&gt;. The basic stalker can enter your shadow
and attack you from there until it kills you. The puppetter does the same but
dominates you to attack your friends while it’s doing it. And the strangler
makes it a lot easier for the other two to do their part.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Secret of Vecna</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;(The book has an illustrated Secret of Vecna. I did not include the image here
because it’s gross.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first saw a stat block for these in Thunderspire Labyrinth, the second
heroic-tier module published for 4e. They appear here in revised form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vecna is an ascended lich, the evil god of secrets and magic. He teaches that
secret knowledge is the path to power, encouraging and rewarding his followers
to learn all they can by whatever means necessary. He also punishes his
followers for willingly &lt;em&gt;sharing&lt;/em&gt; these secrets, an act that is anathema to
him. The most common punishment is to transform the heretic into a Secret of
Vecna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures resemble bald humans with plain features, usually wearing robes
and wielding daggers or staffs. When they get seriously wounded, their skin
sloughs off and they turn into an horrific living ghoul with wickedly sharp
fangs and claws. Secrets lack any will of their own, living to do the bidding of
their divine patron. They get sent to guard sites important to Vecna, or to aid
the plans of his priests. A Secret’s ultimate aim is always to advance Vecna’s
goals, though, even to the detriment of his followers. Smart followers know
never to trust a Secret completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legend says there is a ritual capable of mending a Secret and turning them back
into the person they used to be. This could be done for altruistic reasons, or
as a means of getting access to the information that person knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secrets are Medium Natural Humanoids with a speed of 6. They are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; undead
and have no special resistances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their signature ability is &lt;strong&gt;Horrific Visage&lt;/strong&gt;, which triggers as soon as
they’re bloodied. It works as a Close Burst 3 attack vs. Will. On a hit it does
light psychic damage and pushes the target 3 squares. This is the transformation
into a ghoul-like horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the monster’s abilities can only be used before it transforms, while
others can only be used afterwards. So in practice each Secret has two distinct
attack profiles. The human one is usually some degree of tricksy, while the
“monster” one is simpler but stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enigma-of-vecna&quot;&gt;Enigma of Vecna&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spellcaster who grew too greedy and offered to sell or barter the secrets they
learned in service to Vecna. They retain some of their magic, and gain the
ability to temporarily strip a victim of its memories. They’re Level 6
Controllers with 68 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When human, they fight with &lt;strong&gt;daggers&lt;/strong&gt; and magic. &lt;strong&gt;Shock Bolt&lt;/strong&gt; is a ranged
attack that targets Reflex and does lightning damage, also slowing the target
for a turn. And &lt;strong&gt;Memory Ripper&lt;/strong&gt; is another ranged attack targetting Will and
doing light psychic damage with an awesome rider. Targets hit by this spell are
prevented from using encounter or daily attack powers, and any utility powers
(save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Enigma is bloodied, &lt;strong&gt;Horrific Visage&lt;/strong&gt; triggers and it transforms
into a straightforward melee combatant. Its only attack from that point on is
&lt;strong&gt;Rend Flesh&lt;/strong&gt;, which does heavy physical damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spell-howler-of-vecna&quot;&gt;Spell Howler of Vecna&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a more powerful caster who failed Vecna in some way. Maybe they failed
on a mission given to them by the god, or failed to share a secret with Vecna
after discovering it. Or maybe they just dug too deep and looked into matters
forbidden to one of their rank. They’re Level 18 Artillery with 130 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spell Howlers are powerful enough to not need weapons. Their basic attack is a
&lt;strong&gt;Maddening Touch&lt;/strong&gt; that deals psychic damage. Their basic ranged attack is a
&lt;strong&gt;Word of Force&lt;/strong&gt; that targets Fortitude and does force damage. They can use a
&lt;strong&gt;Word of Madness&lt;/strong&gt; to deal psychic damage, slide the target 3 squares and have
it make a free attack against another target of the howler’s choice. This
recharges on a miss, so they can keep trying it. And finally they can say a
&lt;strong&gt;Word of Pain&lt;/strong&gt; once per encounter to deal heavy necrotic damage to a target,
half on a miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this stops after the transformation. Maddening Touch remains an option,
but their only ranged attack is now the &lt;strong&gt;Word of Doom&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals psychic
damage and dazes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secret-of-vecna&quot;&gt;Secret of Vecna&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The titular monster of the entry used to be a high priest of Vecna who allowed
some of the god’s secrets to fall into the hands of a non-believer. Vecna
appears to them personally to shatter their minds and transform their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secrets are Level 19 Skirmishers with 176 HP. Faster than average, they have a
Speed of 8 and a Teleport speed of 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In human form, they use a &lt;strong&gt;Cloak of Ignorance&lt;/strong&gt; spell that covers a Close Burst
3, deals psychic damage, and makes them invisible to the target (save
ends). Then they move in with &lt;strong&gt;Shocking Grasp&lt;/strong&gt;, a basic attack that deals
lightning damage and has a big damage bonus when the target can’t see the
monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After transforming, their only attack is &lt;strong&gt;Thundering Claws&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals heavy
thunder damage, knocks prone, and slides 1 square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the sort of odd monster that you can typically find in Monster
Manuals numbered 3 or above. Fortunately they had enough space for a nicely
evocative bit of lore. Their mechanics are an interesting take on the
“two-stage” monster, and a different one from both the MM2’s Phoeras and Fey
Lingerers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the lore mentions, these are Vecna’s specialty divine servitors, so they’ll
be found wherever the god’s cultists and temples are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of scary animated scarecrows is a classic, so I’m sure they popped
up in earlier editions. This is their 4e debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarecrows in the middle world are straw mannequins placed on fields to keep
birds away. Scarecrows in the Feywild are terrifying constructs built to keep
&lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; away, and to tear them to pieces if they get too close. Both look the
same, so never forget which plane you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first animated scarecrows were created by a hag with straw stolen from a
farmer at the stroke of midnight, clothes from a freshly slain corpse, and
thread made from the hair of a nightmare. The idea spread quickly, and now lots
of different people use them. I imagine the recipes used by less evil creators
are not as macabre, though the construction of a scarecrow still involves a lot
of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarecrows are a bit less sturdy than golems, but they’re much smarter. They can
understand more complex instructions and have a link to their master that allows
for long-distance, two-way communication. When a scarecrow spots an intruder, it
transmits what it sees to its master. They’re alarm and surveillance systems in
addition to being guardians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the master dies, any surviving scarecrows will keep following their last
orders. This means you could find an ancient ruin guarded by masterless
scarecrows in the Feywild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarecrows are Medium Fey Animates (Constructs). They’re immune to disease,
poison and sleep, though non-minion variants are also vulnerable 10 to
fire. They have low-light vision and a speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scarecrow-shambler&quot;&gt;Scarecrow Shambler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proper scarecrow takes months of careful work, with each stitch and each bit
of straw placed precisely in the configuration that will allow it to hold the
most magic reinforcement and power. A skilled enough ritual caster, however, can
cut a bunch of corners and and produce a small army of these crude models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shamblers are not much tougher than a mundane scarecrow, as their magic barely
holds them together. They are still strong enough to kill someone with their
bare hands, and are filled with toxic mold that spreads through the air when
they are destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures are Level 10 Minion Brutes. Their basic attack is &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; that
does physical damage with no special riders. When destroyed, they disintegrate
in a puff of moldy straw, creating a zone in a Close Burst 1 that lasts until
the end of the encounter. The zone is a poison cloud: it’s lightly obscured and
deals 10 poison damage to anyone who starts their turn inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, shamblers are meant to die en masse and blanket the battlefield in a
giant poison cloud. An ignorant wizard might inadvertently help them along by
popping an entire group with an area attack. I guess they still act as cameras
for their master too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scarecrow-guardian&quot;&gt;Scarecrow Guardian&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “baseline” model discussed in the lore section, painstakingly crafted to act
as a guardian. They’re Level 13 Soldiers with 107 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardians fight with their &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt;, which damage and mark on a hit. They also
have a couple of gaze attacks: &lt;strong&gt;Luring Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (at-will) is a ranged attack that
deals psychic damage and pulls the target 5 squares; and &lt;strong&gt;Horrid Gaze&lt;/strong&gt;
(minor action, encounter) is a Close Blast 3 that deals no damage and
immobilizes for a turn. These are tailored to allow the monster to prevent
intruders from escaping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re also deceptively hard to kill - the &lt;strong&gt;Malleable Straw&lt;/strong&gt; interrupt kicks
in when they’re damaged, and causes them to take half damage from the
attack. Since it’s an interrupt, it only works once per round, but still makes
them more durable than their HP would indicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scarecrow-haunter&quot;&gt;Scarecrow Haunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haunters are created by adding an extra ingredient to the original scarecrow
recipe: the heart of someone who was killed by another scarecrow. It gets sewn
into the construct’s body, from which it irradiates the fear its former owner
felt before dying. The haunter twists this raw emotion into frightening
illusions when hunting down intruders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haunters are Level 13 Lurkers with 99 HP. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; and have
several interesting special attacks. The first one we must mention is the
&lt;strong&gt;Lurking Horror&lt;/strong&gt; passive trait. It makes it so all of their attacks deal 5
extra damage and have their forced movement increased by 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As lurkers, haunters can begin harrassing the party from a distance, while
safely hidden. &lt;strong&gt;Haunting Echoes&lt;/strong&gt; an area burst 2 within 10 attack that targets
the Will of all enemies inside. A hit slides the target 2 squares and forces
them to make a basic attack against a creature of the haunter’s choice as they
try to fight the imaginary ghosts conjured within their minds. With Lurking
Horror, this slide could be as large as 4 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once spotted, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Terrifying Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) as a minor action
to keep the PCs at bay. This is a Close Blast 3 that targets Will, deals light
psychic damage, and pushes 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their “hiding” ability is &lt;strong&gt;Fluttering Straw&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows them to seemingly
burst into a cloud of rotten straw and rags while teleporting 6 squares and
becoming invisible and insubstantial for a turn. They’ll use it to avoid being
surrounded and to resume their stealthy “grenading” with Haunting Echoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite interesting! Animated scarecrows are always good for a bit of scary fun,
and these don’t disappoint. I like the contrast with golems: the creation of a
D&amp;amp;D golem is described like a highly technical process that involves trapping
elemental spirits. The creation of a scarecrow is the telling of a scary fairy
tale, relying on the inherent narrative power of its ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you choose to make less evil scarecrow recipes a thing in your setting,
they’re probably the domain of hags, lamias and other paragon-tier evil fey. A
particularly ancient hag is going to have a small army of Guardians and Haunters
protecting her territory, and the realization that each of these represents at
least one of her previous victims will add to the horror of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want your Heroic-tier players to meet scarecrows without having to trek
to the Feywild, I would suggest statting the Shambler as a Level 3 Regular, and
knocking the other two down to level 6 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
