        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Secret of Vecna</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;(The book has an illustrated Secret of Vecna. I did not include the image here
because it’s gross.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first saw a stat block for these in Thunderspire Labyrinth, the second
heroic-tier module published for 4e. They appear here in revised form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vecna is an ascended lich, the evil god of secrets and magic. He teaches that
secret knowledge is the path to power, encouraging and rewarding his followers
to learn all they can by whatever means necessary. He also punishes his
followers for willingly &lt;em&gt;sharing&lt;/em&gt; these secrets, an act that is anathema to
him. The most common punishment is to transform the heretic into a Secret of
Vecna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures resemble bald humans with plain features, usually wearing robes
and wielding daggers or staffs. When they get seriously wounded, their skin
sloughs off and they turn into an horrific living ghoul with wickedly sharp
fangs and claws. Secrets lack any will of their own, living to do the bidding of
their divine patron. They get sent to guard sites important to Vecna, or to aid
the plans of his priests. A Secret’s ultimate aim is always to advance Vecna’s
goals, though, even to the detriment of his followers. Smart followers know
never to trust a Secret completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legend says there is a ritual capable of mending a Secret and turning them back
into the person they used to be. This could be done for altruistic reasons, or
as a means of getting access to the information that person knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secrets are Medium Natural Humanoids with a speed of 6. They are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; undead
and have no special resistances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their signature ability is &lt;strong&gt;Horrific Visage&lt;/strong&gt;, which triggers as soon as
they’re bloodied. It works as a Close Burst 3 attack vs. Will. On a hit it does
light psychic damage and pushes the target 3 squares. This is the transformation
into a ghoul-like horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the monster’s abilities can only be used before it transforms, while
others can only be used afterwards. So in practice each Secret has two distinct
attack profiles. The human one is usually some degree of tricksy, while the
“monster” one is simpler but stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enigma-of-vecna&quot;&gt;Enigma of Vecna&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spellcaster who grew too greedy and offered to sell or barter the secrets they
learned in service to Vecna. They retain some of their magic, and gain the
ability to temporarily strip a victim of its memories. They’re Level 6
Controllers with 68 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When human, they fight with &lt;strong&gt;daggers&lt;/strong&gt; and magic. &lt;strong&gt;Shock Bolt&lt;/strong&gt; is a ranged
attack that targets Reflex and does lightning damage, also slowing the target
for a turn. And &lt;strong&gt;Memory Ripper&lt;/strong&gt; is another ranged attack targetting Will and
doing light psychic damage with an awesome rider. Targets hit by this spell are
prevented from using encounter or daily attack powers, and any utility powers
(save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Enigma is bloodied, &lt;strong&gt;Horrific Visage&lt;/strong&gt; triggers and it transforms
into a straightforward melee combatant. Its only attack from that point on is
&lt;strong&gt;Rend Flesh&lt;/strong&gt;, which does heavy physical damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spell-howler-of-vecna&quot;&gt;Spell Howler of Vecna&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a more powerful caster who failed Vecna in some way. Maybe they failed
on a mission given to them by the god, or failed to share a secret with Vecna
after discovering it. Or maybe they just dug too deep and looked into matters
forbidden to one of their rank. They’re Level 18 Artillery with 130 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spell Howlers are powerful enough to not need weapons. Their basic attack is a
&lt;strong&gt;Maddening Touch&lt;/strong&gt; that deals psychic damage. Their basic ranged attack is a
&lt;strong&gt;Word of Force&lt;/strong&gt; that targets Fortitude and does force damage. They can use a
&lt;strong&gt;Word of Madness&lt;/strong&gt; to deal psychic damage, slide the target 3 squares and have
it make a free attack against another target of the howler’s choice. This
recharges on a miss, so they can keep trying it. And finally they can say a
&lt;strong&gt;Word of Pain&lt;/strong&gt; once per encounter to deal heavy necrotic damage to a target,
half on a miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this stops after the transformation. Maddening Touch remains an option,
but their only ranged attack is now the &lt;strong&gt;Word of Doom&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals psychic
damage and dazes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secret-of-vecna&quot;&gt;Secret of Vecna&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The titular monster of the entry used to be a high priest of Vecna who allowed
some of the god’s secrets to fall into the hands of a non-believer. Vecna
appears to them personally to shatter their minds and transform their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secrets are Level 19 Skirmishers with 176 HP. Faster than average, they have a
Speed of 8 and a Teleport speed of 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In human form, they use a &lt;strong&gt;Cloak of Ignorance&lt;/strong&gt; spell that covers a Close Burst
3, deals psychic damage, and makes them invisible to the target (save
ends). Then they move in with &lt;strong&gt;Shocking Grasp&lt;/strong&gt;, a basic attack that deals
lightning damage and has a big damage bonus when the target can’t see the
monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After transforming, their only attack is &lt;strong&gt;Thundering Claws&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals heavy
thunder damage, knocks prone, and slides 1 square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the sort of odd monster that you can typically find in Monster
Manuals numbered 3 or above. Fortunately they had enough space for a nicely
evocative bit of lore. Their mechanics are an interesting take on the
“two-stage” monster, and a different one from both the MM2’s Phoeras and Fey
Lingerers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the lore mentions, these are Vecna’s specialty divine servitors, so they’ll
be found wherever the god’s cultists and temples are.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of scary animated scarecrows is a classic, so I’m sure they popped
up in earlier editions. This is their 4e debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarecrows in the middle world are straw mannequins placed on fields to keep
birds away. Scarecrows in the Feywild are terrifying constructs built to keep
&lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; away, and to tear them to pieces if they get too close. Both look the
same, so never forget which plane you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first animated scarecrows were created by a hag with straw stolen from a
farmer at the stroke of midnight, clothes from a freshly slain corpse, and
thread made from the hair of a nightmare. The idea spread quickly, and now lots
of different people use them. I imagine the recipes used by less evil creators
are not as macabre, though the construction of a scarecrow still involves a lot
of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarecrows are a bit less sturdy than golems, but they’re much smarter. They can
understand more complex instructions and have a link to their master that allows
for long-distance, two-way communication. When a scarecrow spots an intruder, it
transmits what it sees to its master. They’re alarm and surveillance systems in
addition to being guardians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the master dies, any surviving scarecrows will keep following their last
orders. This means you could find an ancient ruin guarded by masterless
scarecrows in the Feywild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarecrows are Medium Fey Animates (Constructs). They’re immune to disease,
poison and sleep, though non-minion variants are also vulnerable 10 to
fire. They have low-light vision and a speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scarecrow-shambler&quot;&gt;Scarecrow Shambler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proper scarecrow takes months of careful work, with each stitch and each bit
of straw placed precisely in the configuration that will allow it to hold the
most magic reinforcement and power. A skilled enough ritual caster, however, can
cut a bunch of corners and and produce a small army of these crude models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shamblers are not much tougher than a mundane scarecrow, as their magic barely
holds them together. They are still strong enough to kill someone with their
bare hands, and are filled with toxic mold that spreads through the air when
they are destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures are Level 10 Minion Brutes. Their basic attack is &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; that
does physical damage with no special riders. When destroyed, they disintegrate
in a puff of moldy straw, creating a zone in a Close Burst 1 that lasts until
the end of the encounter. The zone is a poison cloud: it’s lightly obscured and
deals 10 poison damage to anyone who starts their turn inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, shamblers are meant to die en masse and blanket the battlefield in a
giant poison cloud. An ignorant wizard might inadvertently help them along by
popping an entire group with an area attack. I guess they still act as cameras
for their master too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scarecrow-guardian&quot;&gt;Scarecrow Guardian&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “baseline” model discussed in the lore section, painstakingly crafted to act
as a guardian. They’re Level 13 Soldiers with 107 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardians fight with their &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt;, which damage and mark on a hit. They also
have a couple of gaze attacks: &lt;strong&gt;Luring Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (at-will) is a ranged attack that
deals psychic damage and pulls the target 5 squares; and &lt;strong&gt;Horrid Gaze&lt;/strong&gt;
(minor action, encounter) is a Close Blast 3 that deals no damage and
immobilizes for a turn. These are tailored to allow the monster to prevent
intruders from escaping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re also deceptively hard to kill - the &lt;strong&gt;Malleable Straw&lt;/strong&gt; interrupt kicks
in when they’re damaged, and causes them to take half damage from the
attack. Since it’s an interrupt, it only works once per round, but still makes
them more durable than their HP would indicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scarecrow-haunter&quot;&gt;Scarecrow Haunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haunters are created by adding an extra ingredient to the original scarecrow
recipe: the heart of someone who was killed by another scarecrow. It gets sewn
into the construct’s body, from which it irradiates the fear its former owner
felt before dying. The haunter twists this raw emotion into frightening
illusions when hunting down intruders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haunters are Level 13 Lurkers with 99 HP. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; and have
several interesting special attacks. The first one we must mention is the
&lt;strong&gt;Lurking Horror&lt;/strong&gt; passive trait. It makes it so all of their attacks deal 5
extra damage and have their forced movement increased by 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As lurkers, haunters can begin harrassing the party from a distance, while
safely hidden. &lt;strong&gt;Haunting Echoes&lt;/strong&gt; an area burst 2 within 10 attack that targets
the Will of all enemies inside. A hit slides the target 2 squares and forces
them to make a basic attack against a creature of the haunter’s choice as they
try to fight the imaginary ghosts conjured within their minds. With Lurking
Horror, this slide could be as large as 4 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once spotted, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Terrifying Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) as a minor action
to keep the PCs at bay. This is a Close Blast 3 that targets Will, deals light
psychic damage, and pushes 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their “hiding” ability is &lt;strong&gt;Fluttering Straw&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows them to seemingly
burst into a cloud of rotten straw and rags while teleporting 6 squares and
becoming invisible and insubstantial for a turn. They’ll use it to avoid being
surrounded and to resume their stealthy “grenading” with Haunting Echoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite interesting! Animated scarecrows are always good for a bit of scary fun,
and these don’t disappoint. I like the contrast with golems: the creation of a
D&amp;amp;D golem is described like a highly technical process that involves trapping
elemental spirits. The creation of a scarecrow is the telling of a scary fairy
tale, relying on the inherent narrative power of its ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you choose to make less evil scarecrow recipes a thing in your setting,
they’re probably the domain of hags, lamias and other paragon-tier evil fey. A
particularly ancient hag is going to have a small army of Guardians and Haunters
protecting her territory, and the realization that each of these represents at
least one of her previous victims will add to the horror of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want your Heroic-tier players to meet scarecrows without having to trek
to the Feywild, I would suggest statting the Shambler as a Level 3 Regular, and
knocking the other two down to level 6 or so.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Rot Grub</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rog grubs have been around more or less since the beginning, though they used to
be more of a trap than a monster in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rot grubs are voracious parasites with a life cycle so accelerated some scholars
think they’re a divine curse sent by Torog to inflict suffering upon the
world. They burrow into the bodies of larger creatures, eating their flesh and
laying eggs inside. They don’t care if the body in question is alive or dead,
either. A living being infested by a swarm of rot grubs will experience
indescribable agony as they’re eaten alive, and this lasts until the grubs reach
the heart and kill the host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rot grub infestations usually happen in underground dungeons, since they like
the dark and humidity. Sapient creatures that like the same environments quickly
learn to watch out for rot grubs, since an infestation can depopulate their
homes in short order. Some, like orcs, just pull up stakes and move elsewhere
when they find rot grubs. Others try to find uses for them. Kobolds stick them
inside clay pots for use as special sling ammunition. Bugbears use them to
enhance pit traps. Gnolls use them as instruments of torture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These infestations tend to burn themselves out as the rot grubs eat through all
available victims in the area and then die from starvation. Only a few hardy
individuals remain, possibly in hibernation, waiting for the next unwary victim
to approach their corpse host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however legends of entire &lt;em&gt;oceans&lt;/em&gt; of these horrible little things
undulating in the depths of the underdark. Supposedly, they sustain themselves
by feeding on the flesh of a dead god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rot Grubs are Natural Beasts, and a swarm large enough to count as a monster is
Medium in size. These swarms have Speed 5 and Darkvision, so they’re far from
the stationary hazards of earlier editions. If a swarm notices you, it’s going
to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rot-grub-swarm&quot;&gt;Rot Grub Swarm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic model. After killing their first few victims, they retreat inside the
bodies and lay up to ten thousand eggs. These hatch into new swarms after a
month or so. This is the classic “trap” scenario from earlier editions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This swarm is a Level 4 Brute with 63 HP. It has the common traits mentioned
above, and the usual Swarm traits: half damage and no forced movement from
single-target attacks, vulnerable 10 to area attacks, can occupy the same space
as other creatures and squeeze into any space big enough for a single grub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also a &lt;strong&gt;Clumsy Attacker&lt;/strong&gt;, which means it lacks a basic melee attack. It
still has an attack ability, but it’s not considered “basic”. This means the
swarm can’t charge or make opportunity attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;strong&gt;Swarm Aura&lt;/strong&gt; has a size of 1 and deals 5 damage to any enemy that stars
its turn inside. This damage increases by 2 for each extra swarm whose aura
overlaps the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swarm attacks with &lt;strong&gt;Infesting Bites&lt;/strong&gt;, which deal no immediate damage but
inflict ongoing 5 damage on a hit (save ends). This worsens to 10 after the
first failed save, and to 15 after the second. An unlucky level-appropriate
adventurer will find themselves dead from this about as fast as a PC from the
olden days. Save-boosting powers and items are a wise investment here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rot-grub-zombies&quot;&gt;Rot Grub Zombies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-rot-grub-zombie.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even grub-infested corpses are a little more active than they used to be! This
is such a horrible death that it’s not uncommon for the victim to rise as a
zombie soon afterwards. These zombies are on the faster side, and some speculate
they’re controlled by the swarm inside them, since they are drawn to victims
with open wounds that make it easy for the grubs to leap into their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zombie is a Level 8 Skirmisher with 86 HP and Speed 6. Its basic attack is a
&lt;strong&gt;slam&lt;/strong&gt;, and it can also execute a &lt;strong&gt;flailing slam&lt;/strong&gt; that allows it to shift 1
square before or after the attack. Their special attack is &lt;strong&gt;Rot Grub Hunger&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 5+), which targets a bloodied enemy and deals slam damage plus 2d6
necrotic damage. Hit or miss, it also exposes the target to rot grub
infestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the zombie hits 0 HP, &lt;strong&gt;Corpse Collapse&lt;/strong&gt; kicks in and spawns a rot grub
swarm in its space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rot Grub Infestation&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 4 disease with an improve DC of 18 and a
Maintain DC of 12. This makes it a slower version of the infestation implied by
the basic swarm. Stage 1 eats a healing surge and makes the patient vulnerable 5
to necrotic damage. Stage 2 eats a second healing surge and inflicts a -4
penalty to all skill rolls. Stage 3 kills the victim and immediately turns them
into a rot grub zombie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you dislike the way D&amp;amp;D 4 implements disease, you could replace the exposure
effect and bonus necrotic damage of Rot Grub Hunger with the increasing ongoing
damage from the basic swarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;awakened-rot-grub-swarm&quot;&gt;Awakened Rot Grub Swarm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is a swarm that ate something very psionic, maybe it’s a duergar
bioweapon run amok… whatever its origins, this is a rot grub swarm that became
sapient. Its telepathic hive mind emits constant chatter with affirming phrases
such as “Without us, within them, reap their flesh”. Sometimes bits and pieces
of its victim’s minds also contribute to the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awakened swarm is mostly identical to the basic one, but it’s a Level 10
Brute with 123 HP. All the numbers go up, including aura damage and the ongoing
damage inflicted by their attack. They also get a couple of extra psychic
powers. &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Shock&lt;/strong&gt; is a Close Burst 2 that deals no damage but
immobilizes for a turn on a hit. And &lt;strong&gt;Telepathic Lure&lt;/strong&gt; is a ranged attack
(minor action, 1/round) that pulls a target 4 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course this swarm is &lt;em&gt;sapient&lt;/em&gt;, with Int 8, which is plenty to allow it
to set up ambushes or even make conscious alliances with other beings it can’t
eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ewwww. Early D&amp;amp;D modules loved using rot grubs as a sort of lethal trap hidden
inside corpses found in the dungeon, usually those of previous adventurers. It
was not uncommon to also place some enticing loot on these corpses. They can
still be used in this role here, and while they’re not as instantly lethal as
their older versions, they’re still quite dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Ogrémoch</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-ogr%C3%A9moch.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogrémoch is another of the Princes of Elemental Evil, and first appeared
alongside Imix in the Fiend Folio for AD&amp;amp;D 1e. He is the second, but not the
last, epic campaign end boss to make an appearance on the MM3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning there was substance without form, the roiling indistinct mass
of the purest Elemental Chaos. From that mass the eldest primordials arose
spontaneously, and they in turn used their powers to create others. Eventually
this big family decided to get together and create the middle world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogrémoch is one of these eldest Primordials. He witnessed the dawn of time, and
the rise and fall of his children as they built the world and warred with the
gods. Ogrémoch was among the primordials contacted by the Elder Elemental Eye,
and like the other Princes he became convinced the Eye was the very first
primordial. Concerned about the gods’ growing influence on the world, he decided
to join the Dawn War in concert with the other Princes. Despite their atypical
level of teamwork, they lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Imix, Ogrémoch did not escape the gods. He was captured and chained to
his own realm by Moradin. Though he cannot leave, he can still influence the
world through his many cults. His goals are to free both himself and the Elder
Elemental Eye, and to finish what he started during the Dawn War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His greater age and more stable element make Ogrémoch a more patient and wise
Primordial than Imix. Where Imix is a cowardly hothead, Ogrémoch is a cryptic
miser. As the Primordial of Earth, he rules over everything that is hidden
underground, from metal and gem deposits to caves, ruins, and the treasures
buried inside them. Ogrémoch knows many secrets that give one power over the
earth and its hidden bounty, but he’s jealous of them and only gives them up
reluctantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of time and patience for his cultists to earn enough favor to
learn those secrets, so earth magic is rarer among them than you would
expect. It’s no unusual for a cult leader to have to rely on hired muscle to
reinforce the security of their hidden shrines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many independent cults to Ogrémoch spread throughout the world, and
though the details of their beliefs and practices may differ, they’re all
structured like mystery cults. They thrive on the rustic fringes of “civilized”
lands, tricking the innocent and ignorant into believing Ogrémoch is a
benevolent power of the earth. By the time these unfortunates learn the truth,
it’s too late to escape the cult’s grasp. More rarely, they attract more
well-informed people who seek an alternative to the gods. While there are
several deities who preside over the same concepts as the primordial, these
recruits probably reason that, as the older being, Ogrémoch has more of a claim
to these domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the highest levels of initiation, the differences between the many cults fall
away, and the existence of the Elder Elemental Eye is revealed. These
high-ranking cultists serve Ogrémoch and the Eye in equal measure, and out of
all of the elemental cults they’re the most willing to genuinely cooperate in
freeing their masters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll start by looking at the cultists, and finish with the stats for Ogrémoch
himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various cultist stat blocks represent people of various species that managed
to gain power from their worship. As with Imix cultists, there aren’t enough of
them to build encounter groups - they’re meant to be added to groups of other
humanoids or monsters representing hired muscle or “unpowered” cultists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any earth-elemental creature might be associated with a cult of Ogrémoch,
including hill and earth giants. Underground dwellers like grimlocks and
troglodytes are also frequently drawn to his service, as are “giantish” people
like ogres or ettins. And of course, any “generic” humanoid stat block can be
lightly reskinned as a cultist as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;earth-cultist&quot;&gt;Earth Cultist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are common servitors, largely ignorant of the deeper mysteries, serving
because they know nothing else. They’re Level 8 Minion Controllers wearing
leather and wielding &lt;strong&gt;warhammers&lt;/strong&gt;. The scrap of primordial power within then
explodes in a &lt;strong&gt;Petrifying Font&lt;/strong&gt; when they drop to 0 HP: it automatically hits
every enemy adjacent to the cultist and slows them (save ends). After the first
failed save, this worsens to &lt;em&gt;petrified&lt;/em&gt; (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yikes! These poor souls are unwitting time bombs, and quite dangerous for
minions. Evil GMs would mix them in with standard &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/06/05/human.html&quot;&gt;Human minions&lt;/a&gt; and make it
hard for players to tell them apart at first. Once the cultist’s capabilities
have been identified, it’s best to take then out with ranged attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fist-of-the-stone-tyrant&quot;&gt;Fist of the Stone Tyrant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every dwarf culture remembers their period of enslavement to the giants as the
Age of Chains. Most of them became resentful of the primordials after attaining
their freedom, and turned to worship of the gods. One felt the opposite, turning
away from the gods who did not help them and towards the primordials who had
proven they would reward their worshippers well. The Fist of the Stone Tyrant is
a champion from this culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Fist is a Level 9 Soldier (Leader) with 98 HP and a Speed of 5 (Earth
Walk). They have two simultaneous auras with a radius of 1: &lt;strong&gt;Rotting Earth&lt;/strong&gt;
slows enemies inside, and &lt;strong&gt;Stone Tyrant’s Boon&lt;/strong&gt; grants allies inside a +2
bonus to AC and Fortitude. Like any other dwarf, the Fist reduces any forced
movement inflicted upon it by 1. It also gets an immediate save to avoid being
knocked prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fist’s &lt;strong&gt;war pick&lt;/strong&gt; damages and marks for a turn on a hit, and if any marked
enemy leaves its Rotting Earth aura the champion can shift 1 square and make a
free attack against that enemy. The attack deals light physical damage, 5
ongoing necrotic damage (save ends) and immobilizes for a turn on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stone-thrall&quot;&gt;Stone Thrall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogres who live in hill giant territories might end up picking worship of
Ogrémoch from them. Some of these ogres get drawn into the cult and infused with
earth magic to act as guards and shock troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone Thralls are Level 15 Brutes with 184 HP. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;Mauls&lt;/strong&gt; whose
basic attacks damage and force the target to grant combat advantage for a
turn. They can use a &lt;strong&gt;Crushing Smash&lt;/strong&gt; against someone granting them CA to do
heavier damage, knock the target prone, and make them both immobilized and
unable to stand up (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also make &lt;strong&gt;Wild Swings&lt;/strong&gt;, attacking up to 2 creatures with one
action. A hit deals heavy damage and dazes (save ends). This is an encounter
power that recharges when the ogre is first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;earth-weird&quot;&gt;Earth Weird&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogrémoch rarely deigns to notice individual mortals. Sometimes, though, a
cultist comes along with such an aptitude for earth magic that the primordial
ends up giving them a direct blessing. This turns them into earth weirds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one depicted here is an earthsoul genasi, and a Level 16 Controller with 148
HP. It fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Morningstar&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and pushes the target 1
square. It also uses a bunch of different earth-themed spells:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quake Bolt&lt;/strong&gt; is a basic ranged attack that damages and knocks prone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bury&lt;/strong&gt; targets a prone enemy and does no immediate damage, but it
immobilizes the target, prevents them from standing up and inflicts ongoing 10
damage (save ends all). After passing the save, the target is slowed for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stoneburst&lt;/strong&gt; is a ranged area attack that damages and created a zone of
difficult terraint for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;strong&gt;Earthshock&lt;/strong&gt; is a minor action encounter power that does no
damage but knocks every enemy touching a solid surface in a Close Burst 1
prone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weird wants to knock you down and bury you. It pairs well with other enemies
with knockdown abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chthonic-apostle&quot;&gt;Chthonic Apostle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most giants who serve Ogrémoch do so more out of fear than true devotion. This
one is an exception, and has been rewarded for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apostle depicted here is a hill giant, and a Level 24 Soldier with 225
HP. It fights with a giant-sized, Reach 3 &lt;strong&gt;greatspear&lt;/strong&gt; whose basic attacks
damage and mark for a turn on a hit. It can also use the spear to &lt;strong&gt;impale&lt;/strong&gt; a
marked creature, which deals light physical damage to start with and slides the
creature to the apostle’s space as they slide down the length of the weapon. The
target is immobilized and takes 10 ongoing damage, automatically moving when the
apostle moves. The apostle can keep attacking with the spear, and every time
they do so the impaled victim takes another 10 damage and becomes dazed for a
turn. When they successfully save against this, they slide to a space adjacent
to the apostle as they free themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the apostle becomes bloodied, their &lt;strong&gt;Stone Curse&lt;/strong&gt; begins to take
effect. Their speed drops from the standard giant 8 to a 4, and they rain Resist
10 to all damage. When the apostle drops to 0 HP, they permanently become a
stone statue, which counts as blocking terrain. If they have a victim impaled
when that happens, the victim becomes restrained instead of immobilized. A save
still frees them as above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chthonic-stoneshaper&quot;&gt;Chthonic Stoneshaper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worship of Ogrémoch is almost as old as mortal life itself. There are profoundly
ancient shrines and temples to the primordial in the depths of the
Underdark. Those who undertake a prilgrimage to these sites and survive the
journey are rewarded with potent magic, and by having much of their troublesome
free will taken away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stoneshaper depicted here is a human who has undergone this process. It’s
basically a powered-up Earth Weird, with more damaging spells. It’s Level 24
Artillery with 175 HP. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;Warhammers&lt;/strong&gt;, and have several
spells. First there’s &lt;strong&gt;Stony Embrace&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 10), a basic attack that
damages, restrains and inflicts 10 ongoing damage on a hit (save ends). Then
there’s &lt;strong&gt;Rending Earth&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 20), which targets enemies restrained by Stony
Embrace, deals slightly more damage, and stuns then (save ends). Finally there’s
&lt;strong&gt;Unruly Earth&lt;/strong&gt;, a close burst 2 that damages, pushes 3 squares, and knocks
prone on a hit. This only targets enemies, too, so it can be used safely in a
melee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “save ends” stun is extremely powerful, and though the targetting condition
for Rending Earth is fairly restrictive a focused and lucky stoneshaper might be
able to use it every other turn. When fighting an enemy group including a
stoneshaper, follow the old Shadowrun adage and geek the mage first. The
stoneshaper will make this hard because the ranges involved make it easy for the
stoneshaper to stay far away and play hit-and-run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogrémoch&quot;&gt;Ogrémoch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking at the cultists, it’s time to look at the Big Rock
himself. Ogrémoch’s domain is a flat-topped mountain in the depths of the
Elemental Chaos. He’s bound there by chains forged by Moradin from the whipping
winds that used to scoured that mountain. Though Ogrémoch is unable to leave his
domain, his confinement does not prevent him from affecting the mortal world
indirectly, and empowering his cultists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the cowardly Imix, Ogrémoch prefers to fight alone. His preferred
battlefields are vast rocky plains and enormous caverns where his powers can
easily shape the terrain. PCs will mostly likely fight him as a campaign end
boss, either in his own domain or in another similar battlefield after he
escapes his prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogrémoch is a Gargantuan Elemental Humanoid with the Earth and Primordial
keywords, and a Level 34 Solo Soldier with 1244 HP. He has a ground speed of 8
with Earth Walk, and can also burrow and climb at the same speed. His special
senses include Darkvision and Tremorsense 20, and he is immune to poison, sleep
and disease. He also has the best version of demon-style Variable Resistance,
with a value of 20 switchable 3 times per encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primordial has three passive traits that explain why he likes stony or
earthy battlefields. The first is &lt;strong&gt;Jagged Earth&lt;/strong&gt; is an aura (5) that turns its
area into difficult terrain. The first time a creature enters this aura on their
turn, they must pass a DC 32 Athletics or Acrobatics check or take 20
damage. Creatures with Earth Walk ignore the aura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second trait is &lt;strong&gt;Earthbound&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows Big O to ignore any forced
movement or knockdown effects as long as he’s standing on a solid surface. And
finally we have &lt;strong&gt;Earth Glide&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing him to pass through earth and stone
as if he had phasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His attacks of course include a lot of punches and their shockwaves, but before
we get to that, let’s look at the parallel minigame he’s got going with his
minor actions. &lt;strong&gt;Encasing Shards&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) is a Close Blast 5 that targets
the Fortitude of everyone caught inside. It does no immediate damage, but is one
of those very fun gradual petrification effects. On a hit the victims are
immobilized (save ends), and this worsens to stunned and finally to petrified as
they fail their saves. They can still roll saves to end the petrification, but
those have a -5 penalty. Once Ogrémoch is bloodied, he can detonate those stony
cocoons with &lt;strong&gt;Earthshatter&lt;/strong&gt;. This ends the petrification and makes a Close
Burst 3 attack centered on and including the victim. It deals a good bit of
physical damage for a minor action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogrémoch’s basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; that does a big chunk of damage and
automatically dazes all of the target’s adjacent targets for a
turn. &lt;strong&gt;Ogrémoch’s Fury&lt;/strong&gt; allows the primordial to make two slam attacks with
the same action, or three if bloodied. If more than one of these hits the same
target, it pushes that target 10 squares and worsens the Encasing Shards
condition if they’re currently affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth Smash&lt;/strong&gt; is a Close Blast 5 attack that does about half the damage of a
direct slam hit, but causes targets to fall prone and become dazed (save
ends). It does half damage on a miss. And then there’s &lt;strong&gt;Tremendous Quake&lt;/strong&gt;,
which is a Close Burst 10 and so is likely to affect every PC. It’s an attack
vs. Fortitude that does a amazing damage, slides 4 squares, knocks prone, dazes
and prevents the target from getting up (save ends for these last two). Even on
a miss it does half damage, slides 1 square and knocks prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he still has triggered actions! &lt;strong&gt;Jagged Eruption&lt;/strong&gt; is a Close Blast 3
attack that happens as a reaction to Ogrémoch getting hit with a melee
attack. &lt;strong&gt;Eternal Resilience&lt;/strong&gt; is the similar to Lolth’s ability, allowing him
to immediately roll a save when hit by an effect a save can end. This means such
effects only have a 25% chance of happening at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary: good luck keeping your balance or even acting at all when fighting a
living earthquake that’s also trying to petrify you. This much action denial on
a single monster is usually a design no-no, but we’re talking about a solo
endgame boss here, so I feel it’s more than justified.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Ogre</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-ogre.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ogre situation in the Monster Manual 3 is the same as the giant situation:
they first appeared in the Monster Manual 1, and are about to get new and
improved versions of those entries in the Monster Vault. The MM3 contains more
“exotic” variants that will nicely complement the rewritten “basic” ones from
the MV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classic ogres, such as the ones that will show up on the Monster Vault, are
comically stupid brutes. The ones contained in this entry break that stereotype
by being significantly smarter, and capable of sophisticated tactics on the
level of any other humanoid opposition. In other words, the Monster Vault will
Ogre Harder while the Monster Manual 3 will Ogre Smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra brainpower of these ogres doesn’t necessarily make them &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; - the
entries here are still all Chaotic Evil, they’re just smarter about it. Nothing
prevents you from Shreking it up and having ogres that are both smart and
non-evil at your table, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, Ogres are Large Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 8. Everything
else about them varies per stat block, though their abilities tend to be styled
as big smashy strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogre-cave-hunter&quot;&gt;Ogre Cave Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is &lt;em&gt;sneaky&lt;/em&gt;. The Cave Hunter has learned to perform stealthy raids,
evade pursuers, and lure them to ambush spots disguised to look like the ogre’s
home cave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cave Hunters are Level 8 Lurkers with 70 HP. Like typical ogres, they wear hide
and fight with ogre-sized &lt;strong&gt;Clubs&lt;/strong&gt; that have Reach 2. However they can use
these weapons in more creative ways beyond the usual basic attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smash and Swing&lt;/strong&gt; does half the damage of a basic attack, but dazes for a turn
and allows the ogre to slide the target up to 5 squares on a hit. It’s excellent
for herding PCs together so other monsters can use area attacks, and for opening
them up for the truly damaging attacks from the cave hunter itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these is &lt;strong&gt;Skull Bash&lt;/strong&gt;, which requires a dazed target and does
roughly double the damage of a basic attack. The second is &lt;strong&gt;Victim Shield&lt;/strong&gt;, an
interrupt that requires a dazed enemy within 2 squares and triggers when it’s
targeted by a melee or ranged attack. It gives the ogre +4 to defenses against
that attack, and if the attack misses the chosen victim takes its damage
instead. In that case the cave hunter can also slide the victim 4 squares to
another space within 2 squares of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the hunter doesn’t need to have dazed the victims itself in order to
use these abilities, so if there are other monsters who can daze in the fight,
they’ll be able to use these abilities more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogre-ironclad&quot;&gt;Ogre Ironclad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogre Ironclads are smart enough to wear piecemeal metal armor instead of the
more usual raw hides, and to fight using tactics that resemble cavalry, with
closed ranks and powerful charges. Since their armor is still kind of
improvised, being looted from smaller victims, it tends to fall off if it takes
too many hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironclads are Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They wield big &lt;strong&gt;Mauls&lt;/strong&gt; whose basic
attacks mark for a turn on a hit. Their &lt;strong&gt;Ironclad Reaction&lt;/strong&gt; gives them a free
attack against a marked enemy that ignores the mark, and this attack also pushes
the enemy 1 square and knocks them prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the ironclad is bloodied they take a -2 penalty to AC, but their charges
allow them to make basic attacks against up to 2 targets instead of the usual
single attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogre-storm-shaman&quot;&gt;Ogre Storm Shaman&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storm Shamans are perhaps the only ogres in the books that have no negative
modifiers in any of their mental attributes. They worship the primal spirits
that symbolize the fury of the storm, and their magic can bring that fury down
on their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storm Shamans are Level 11 Controllers with 114 HP. All of their attacks have a
storm magic theme. They can cast &lt;strong&gt;Thunder Blasts&lt;/strong&gt; to deal thunder damage and
deafen (save ends), or &lt;strong&gt;Call Lightning&lt;/strong&gt; to deal lightning damage and blind
(save ends). Their melee attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Thunder Staff&lt;/strong&gt; that deals thunder damage
and can daze (save ends) if it hits a blinded or deafened enemy. Those ranged
spells are also area attacks, so there’s a big chance that they’ll leave
&lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; vulnerable to a daze from the staff. A second shaman in the encounter
will make them both even more annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogre-dreadnought&quot;&gt;Ogre Dreadnought&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, this is pretty much an upgraded version of the Ogre Ironclad
above. Unlike the Ironclad, the Dreadnought actually uses custom-fitted gear,
wearing a full suit of plate and wielding a greatsword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreadnoughts are Level 14 Soldiers with 140 HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;greatsword&lt;/strong&gt; has a
Threatening Reach 2, and its basic attack also immobilizes for a turn on a
hit. If the dreadnought fails a saving throw, it can use &lt;strong&gt;Dreadnought Resolve&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 4+) as a reaction to immediately reroll it with a +2 bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re almost Brutes, in other words, since they lack a marking power. Still,
Threatening Reach and immobilizing attacks make them effective at halting the
PCs’ advance, so the Soldier role still fits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pretty varied lineup, especially when combined with the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/08/13/ogre.html&quot;&gt;Monster Vault
ogres&lt;/a&gt;. It should easily allow you to build all-ogre encounters for use as
the inhabitants of a lair or as a special unit in some other villainous force.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Oblivion Moss</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-oblivion-moss.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This based on the Obliviax, a monster that showed up in the 1e MM2. It’s
completely changed for this edition, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oblivion moss, sometimes also known as memory moss, is a sapient predatory plant
that lives in the depths of old forests. It looks like a carpet of moss, but it
can perceive its surroundings and move around slowly in search of prey. The
creature feeds on memories, which it strips from the brains of its victims. It
derives sustenance from those stolen thoughts, and can also use them to spawn
humanoid simulacra that help it defend itself and find more food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memory stripping process is not actually fatal or permanent, but it’s still
very traumatic. Stolen memories return at different rates. An adventurer’s
knowledge of combat spells and maneuvers might come back after mere seconds,
still in the middle of the fight. Important personal memories (“who am I?”) come
back after a day or two, but smaller details (“what does my mother look like?”)
can take weeks to be restored. Of course, the moss and its constructs are quite
capable of fighting to kill, and might choose to kill a victim anyway after
stealing their memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dryads and Treants cultivate patches of oblivion moss close to their own
territories, as a security measure. Invaders who stumble upon them have their
memories ripped away and end up turned around, leaving the forest without
knowing what they were doing or where they went while inside. Even if the
knowledge comes back later, very few people are keen on repeating the
experience. As the book says, in places where oblivion moss grows, lost ruins
tend to stay lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can turn the memory stealing around, too. The remains of a slain patch of
oblivion moss retain memory fragments from its past victims, and if someone eats
those bits they can acquire those memories. While the fragmentary memories of a
bandit might not give you their entire guard rotation or the map of their
stronghold, they might give you the combination to their main vault or to a
secret door.  That can be useful, though eating a sapient being presents obvious
ethical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a bunch of different stat blocks here, one for the moss itself and five
for the humanoid minions it can build from stolen memories. The minions can be
generated mid-fight by the moss, or they might be placed as normal monsters in
an encounter with or without their master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oblivion-moss-mindmaster&quot;&gt;Oblivion Moss Mindmaster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the moss itself, a Large Fey Magical Beast (plant) and a Level 12 Elite
Controller with 250 HP. It perceives the world with Blindsight 20, and moves
around at a glacial ground and climb speeds of 2. It does have Forest Walk,
though, so it’s not further slowed down by difficult terrain in its natural
habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moss projects a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Blindness Aura&lt;/strong&gt; (1) that makes it invisible to
enemies that start their turns inside until the end of the enemy’s next turn. It
can defend itself in melee with a &lt;strong&gt;Corriding Touch&lt;/strong&gt; that does immediate and
ongoing acid damage, but it really wants to use its psychic powers instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has two basic ranged attacks: &lt;strong&gt;Scramble the Mind&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Scour the
Mind&lt;/strong&gt;. Both to the same amount of psychic damage. Additionally, Scramble slides
the target 5 squares and Scour makes the moss or one of its allies invisible to
the target for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its ultimate attack is &lt;strong&gt;Absorb Memories&lt;/strong&gt;, a ranged attack vs. Will that does
no damage. A hit prevents the target from using encounter or daily attack powers
(save ends). Hit or miss, the moss then creates a mossling duplicate of the
target, which uses the most closely matching mossling stat block (see
below). This recharges when there are no created mosslings in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mindmaster can spend a minor action to &lt;strong&gt;Direct&lt;/strong&gt; a mossling, allowing it to
move its speed as a free action. And it can also &lt;strong&gt;Absorb Damage&lt;/strong&gt; as an
interrupt, taking into itself the damage from an attack that would hit a
mossling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a moss mindmaster would only be able to keep a single mossling around at a
time. If you want there to be more of them, add some as part of the initial
encounter makeup. Those don’t count as “created”, so the moss doesn’t have to
wait to use Absorb Memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mosslings&quot;&gt;Mosslings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mosslings are Medium Fey Humanoids, and all of them are Level 12
Minions. They’re meant to be copies of people whose memories were absorbed by
the oblivion moss - the creature is smart enough to seek out competent
combatants for this purpose, since they make for more powerful mosslings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their signature passive trait is &lt;strong&gt;Mindmaster’s Thrall&lt;/strong&gt; - if the mossling in
question was created by an oblivion moss mindmaster, it acts immediately after
its creator’s turn. They all have Forest Walk too, and a basic tendril attack
that does minion-tier damage and has a rider compatible with their role. But the
real star of the show here is the &lt;strong&gt;Simulacrum Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows them to
copy an at-will power from a PC!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the mossling was created by Absorb Memories during this fight, it will be a
power from the PC that attack targeted. If you’re adding the mossling as part of
the encounter, pick a PC whose class is similar to the mossling’s role and give
them one of that PC’s powers. The attack targets AC and its bonus is based on
the mossling’s level as normal, but the damage and all other effects are
identical to the PC’s, as if it was the PC who hit. Some of them copy melee
attacks, others copy ranged attacks, but the match-up is not a problem because
you always use a mossling archetype compatible with the power you want to
replicate, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book recommends having &lt;em&gt;the players themselves&lt;/em&gt; roll and resolve the
mossling’s attacks, to reinforce the feeling that they’re fighting
themselves. That’s clever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the different varieties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Guardian&lt;/strong&gt;: Soldier, speed 6. Has an aura (1) that slows
enemies. Tendril attack allows it to shift 1 square and pull an enemy into the
vacated space. Copies a melee power. Use to copy PC defenders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Creeper&lt;/strong&gt;: Skirmisher, speed 8. Deals extra damage with combat
advantage. Tendril strike allows it to shift 2 squares. Shifts 2 squares when
missed by a melee attack. Copies a melee power. Use to copy rogues and other
melee strikers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Hurler&lt;/strong&gt;: Artillery, speed 6. Explodes on death, dealing a bit of
psychic damage and inflicting Daze (save ends) on a Close Burst 2. No riders
on tendril attack. Steals a ranged power. Use to copy ranged strikers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Grower&lt;/strong&gt;: Controller (Leader). Has an aura (1) that grants +2
defense to plant allies. Tendril attack slows for a turn. Gives 20 temporary
hit points to every nonminion plant ally within 3 squares on death. Copies a
melee power. Use to copy warlords and other leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Vinecaller&lt;/strong&gt;: Controller. Has an aura (1) that makes the covered
spaces difficult terrain. Makes a Close Burst 1 in to difficult terrain for
the rest of the encounter on death. Tendril strike slides target 2
squares. Copies a ranged power. Use to copy wizards and other controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the mossling mechanic is really clever, particularly the bit where
players roll and resolve their duplicate’s attacks. It helps ease the GM’s
cognitive load a bit since mosslings are kinda finnicky even before you factor
the copied attack in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, a moss mindmaster can only keep one mossling around at a
time. If you want to have more of them in play, the easiest way is to add more
of them as standard minions to the encounter. In this case I guess they would
have their own Initiative rolls, and would be worth XP as normal, but the
mindmaster could still target them with Direct Mossling and Absorb Damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option might be to turn the Mindmaster into a solo! Aside from the usual
adjustments, you would want to make Absorb Memories at-will and remove the limit
on the number of created mosslings in play. Maybe also turn Absorb Damage into a
Free or No Action to make it usable as many times per turn as the moss wants.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Nymph</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nymphs have been in the game since the beginning, and they were always one of
its many, many “seductress” monsters. The only reason I can think for there
being so many of them is that Gygax had issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Fourth Edition, Nymphs are fey descended from some of the oldest primal
spirits: the Sisters of the Four Seasons, and the Brothers of the Four
Winds. Thus they combine their mothers’ beauty with their fathers’ impulsive and
fickle personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Dawn War ended and the Four Seasons took upon themselves the work of
maintaining the world’s natural cycles, the nymphs withdrew into the Feywild and
spent a long time living there in harmony with nature. However, they’re not
content with just staying quiet forever, so they eventually began to range
further afield in search of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nymphs just love mortals. They make such wonderful toys, you see. It’s very easy
to convince them to do stuff, and to swear eternal loyalty and love. Toys
sometimes break, but that’s just how things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nymphs are divided into subtypes corresponding to the four seasons, each with a
different basic personality but sharing the same disdain for mortals. There’s
also a fifth type that explains where dryads come from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nymphs are Medium Fey Humanoids with Low Light Vision and Forest Walk (meaning
they ignore forest-themed difficult terrain). All of their other abilities vary
per stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spring-nymph&quot;&gt;Spring Nymph&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-nymph-spring.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring nymphs are always seeing new life appear everywhere to replace the
old. They have power over flowers, and adorn themselves with them. They are the
most childish and romantic of the bunch, so they enjoy seducing mortals and
playing mind games with them to get those mortals to chase her and to fight each
other for her favor. Spring nymphs will often ensure the prettiest mortal
survives these contests, and will then permanently dominate them through
constant exposure to the nymph’s psychotropic scent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring Nymphs are Level 5 Controllers with 63 HP and Speed 6. Their powers are
all seduction and flower-themed, making them some of the most stereotypical
nymphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a &lt;strong&gt;Charmed Defense&lt;/strong&gt; passive that gives them +3 to all defenses while
adjacent to a creature dominated by them. Their basic melee attack is
&lt;strong&gt;Passion’s Kiss&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets Will, does low psychic damage, and dazes (save
ends). Their basic ranged attack is &lt;strong&gt;Song of Spring&lt;/strong&gt;, which is similar but
does a bit more damage and slows instead of dazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she doesn’t have anyone dominated, the spring nymph can use &lt;strong&gt;Floral
Perfume&lt;/strong&gt; to rectify this situation. This is a ranged attack vs. Will that must
target a dazed or slowed creature, and on a hit pulls the target 3 squares and
dominates them (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, once per encounter, the nymph can use &lt;strong&gt;Cloud of Blossoms&lt;/strong&gt;, a ranged
area attack that targets non-dominated enemies, attacks Will, and slows on a hit
(save ends). After the first failed save, the target becomes unconscious
instead. So this is more of an emergency escape hatch than an opening strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When building an encounter with spring nymphs, you can add any number of sapient
humanoids of any species to Team Monster. These are her permanently dominated
pawns, and they should definitely count as “dominated” for the purposes of
Charmed Defense even if they act normally otherwise. Lacking any of these, the
nymph will do her best to keep a PC dominated and stick close to them. Spring
nymphs don’t do a lot of damage on their own, so they need the help of their
pawns. An encounter against &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; spring nymphs is very dangerous, though,
since they’ll be able to dominate multiple PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;autumn-nymphs&quot;&gt;Autumn Nymphs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-nymph-autumn.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the most melancholic members of the family. Autumn is the season when
leaves are reaching the end of their lives and remembering their pasts. Autumn
nymphs are always in that mood, and love collecting and remembering the stories
of mortals’ lives. Autumn nymphs trade in secrets, one for one. This makes them
good sources of information, but you have to be willing to share your own
secrets in exchange. If you don’t, their vengeance can be terrible and
persistent as they turn their secret-themed abilities against you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autumn Nymphs are Level 8 Skirmishers with 89 HP, a ground speed of 6 and a
flight speed of 6 (clumsy, like a leaf in the wind). Their basic attack is a
strike with their &lt;strong&gt;Oaken Strength&lt;/strong&gt;, which damages and pushes the target 1
square. Their other abilities are all secret-themed spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark Revelation&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 6+) is a melee attack that causes light psychic
damage and stuns (save ends). It represents the nymph using contact telepathy to
fill the victim’s head with, well, fake news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whisper Game&lt;/strong&gt; is an interesting ranged attack. It inflicts immediate and
ongoing psychic damage (save ends). Until the end of the encounter, or until the
nymph drops to 0 HP, any time a creature saves against the ongoing damage the
condition “jumps” to the nearest of the victim’s allies within 10 squares. When
the nymph drops to 0 HP, whoever is suffering from this ongoing damage takes 15
psychic damage. This psychic hot potato recharges if the nymph misses with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a move action, the nymph can use &lt;strong&gt;Autumn Winds&lt;/strong&gt; to either shift 1 square or
move her speed, and then use Oaken Strength for free. And when an enemy misses
her with a melee attack, she can use &lt;strong&gt;Secret of Autumn Leaves&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction
to shift 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nymph’s first priority should be to get the Whisper Game going, then stun
someone with Dark Revelation whenever it’s available. After that she wants to
move around and herd the PCs using Oaken Strength so all of them remain close
enough to catch the Whisper Game damage. Autumn Nymphs don’t go for domination,
but they can still have willing fey allies to help with all that. Multiple
autumn nymphs in the same encounter means multiple Whisper Games and multiple
save-ends stuns in a round, so only do that if you really want to make your PCs
suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wood-nymphs&quot;&gt;Wood Nymphs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, an autumn nymph’s melancholy gets the better of her. She grows tired
of her games, or discovers she had actual fondness for a mortal that escaped her
clutches. These nymphs cast off their humanoid guises and give themselves over
to their wild natures, slowly transforming into trees. They stay for a long time
in this in-between state, and some go on to become dryads. The Wood Nymph stat
block represents the in-between state, where the nymph can leave its tree body
to attack trespassers or despoilers, but can’t move too far away from it. This
is actually closer to a mythological dryad than the D&amp;amp;D dryad is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wood Nymphs are Level 10 Soldiers with 104 HP and speed 6. They are
&lt;strong&gt;Treebound&lt;/strong&gt;, which means they’ll be always encountered close to their
tree. This tree occupies 1 square on the battle map. The nymph can enter it and
gains full cover while inside. It also counts as an ally for the purposes of
flanking. While adjacent to or inside the tree, the nymph has &lt;strong&gt;Regeneration&lt;/strong&gt;
5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nymph’s first priority in battle is to tag someone with &lt;strong&gt;Trapped in the
Wood&lt;/strong&gt;, which does no damage but teleports the target inside the nymph’s
tree. This removes the victim from play (save ends). The nymph can teleport 8
squares to a space adjacent ot the tree as an effect. A successful save places
the victim back on the map, adjacent to the tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can also hit a PC with her &lt;strong&gt;Lonely Keening&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter ranged attack
that deals psychic damage on a hit. The interesting thing about it is its
effect, though, which happens even on a miss. Until the end of the encounter, or
until the nymph drops to 0 HP, the victim takes 5 damage at the end of any turn
in which it’s not either adjacent to the nymph or closer to her than they were
at the start of the turn. An excellent attack to use on those ranged PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the nymph can teleport up to 6 squares to a space adjacent to the tree
as a move action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that the victim of Trapped in the Wood is not considered to be in the tree’s
space for game purposes! They’re &lt;em&gt;removed from play&lt;/em&gt;. Which means the Nymph can
hit them with Lonely Keening, trap them in the tree, and stay adjacent to the
tree to keep her regeneration while damaging the victim at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appropriate buddies for wood nymphs include full dryads, wood woads, and other
treelike fey who are hanging around their new sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;winter-nymph&quot;&gt;Winter Nymph&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-nymph-winter.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter nymphs live in cold and remote regions, and like their linked season
they’re cruel and harsh. Winter nymphs are all about reveling in the survival of
the strongest. They run ahead of the Wild Hunt, dressed in buckskin, their
nettle hair spreading out behind them in the wind. They seek the toughest and
most cunning opponents as their prey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter Nymphs are Level 15 Artillery with 116 HP, a ground speed of 7, and a fly
speed of 10. Unlike their sisters, they fight with weapons. Their basic melee
attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Hunter’s Knife&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and allows them to shift 1 square on
a hit. Their basic ranged attack is a longbow that shoots arrows laced with
&lt;strong&gt;Winter’s Wind&lt;/strong&gt;, doing cold damage and slowing on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If too many enemies crowd their space, they can use a &lt;strong&gt;Nettling Wind&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 5+) to target up to 3 creatures in a Close Blast 5. On a hit, this
does physical damage and immobilizes (save ends). And once per encounter they
can fire a &lt;strong&gt;Hail of Arrows&lt;/strong&gt; that works like like Area burst 3, Range 20
attack. It targets enemies, does physical damage, and inflicts ongoing physical
damage (save ends). That’s a good opening strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appropriate companions for winter nymphs are, of course, the Wild
Hunt. Paragon-tier fey hounds and perhaps some eladrin or firbolg hunters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summer-nymph&quot;&gt;Summer Nymph&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-nymph-summer.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring is about the potential of the future; autumn about reflecting on the
past; and summer is the present. Summer nymphs are among the eldest and wisest
of the seasons’ children, for they see everything as it comes to pass. Though
they love to play games with mortals just as much as their sisters, their own
games are much more complex, some times spanning multiple worlds and vast
stretches of time. They are the nymph’s equivalent of board game geeks, and they
love playing live-action Twilight Imperium and Diplomacy. Their motivations and
goals are always hidden from those she uses as playing pieces, and might look
inscrutable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nymph portrayed here is a legit demigodess, a Level 25 Controller with 233
HP and the Leader keyword. She is peer to elder dragons and to the greatest
among angels and devils, and she could end up interacting with gods or exarchs
directly. Not being an elite or solo, she’s not as individually powerful as some
of those dragons and immortals, but she can command nature itself in the form of
large hosts of animals, fey, and plant creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summer nymph projects an aura of &lt;strong&gt;Renewing Growth&lt;/strong&gt; (5) that makes its
covered area into difficult terrain for enemies. Any enemy inside the aura who
doesn’t move during their turn is slowed until the end of their next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her attacks do below-average damage, but have powerful control effects. Her
melee basic attack is &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom’s Touch&lt;/strong&gt;, which damages and dazes for a
turn. Her basic ranged attack is &lt;strong&gt;Eyes of Summer&lt;/strong&gt;,  which deals radiant
damage and blinds (save ends). She can also &lt;strong&gt;Call Storm Winds&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+),
a ranged area attack that deals lighting and thunder damage to enemies, and
slides them 3 squares on a hit. The storm persists for a turn and can be
sustained with a minor action, which also allows the nymph to slide anyone
inside it 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an at-will move action, the nymph can employ her &lt;strong&gt;Omniscient Strategy&lt;/strong&gt; to
shift 1 square and allow one of her allies to move their speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summer nymph is a mastermind, so PCs will likely come into contact with her
minions and with the edges of her scheme long before they fight her in
person. If that happens, she will certainly be accompanied by a bodyguard of
similarly epic fey, including elder treants, mythical beasts, and eladrin
nobles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She can also be used in a more ambiguous role, as a dangerous source of
information. She is guaranteed to know the answer to any question about the
present state of the universe, but the favors she asks in return are also
guaranteed to advance some obscure scheme of hers and make pawns of the PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pleasantly surprised that out of the five nymph variants we saw here, only
one of them is actually a seductress. And even that one is more about
floral-scented mind control than the “she’s just that sexy” trope of old D&amp;amp;D
nymphs. As a bonus, the text never mentions the gender of the hapless mortal
victims, so this is equal-opportunity mind control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorites are the winter and summer nymphs, who do the most to break that old
stereotype. The wood nymph comes next for her tree-based shenanigans, though
narratively she’s very redundant with 4e dryads.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Norker</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-norker.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norkers have been around since the days of AD&amp;amp;D, where their major mechanical
distinction was that they were stronger goblins with AC 3. They play a
significant role in The Forgotten Temple or Tharizdun as the rank and file of
the occupying force the PCs need to clear out before they can delve the temple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norkers in 4e are descendants of goblins who emigrated to the Elemental Chaos
and sought shelter in deep caves in order to survive the harsh conditions of
that plane. The earth-aspected ambient energy of their chosen habitat mutated
them over generations, granting them stony skin and minor earth-based powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norker populations have since crossed back into the middle world, where they
live in mountainous regions, in the Underdark, and near fonts of earth-aspected
elemental power. Some sages speculate that the original norkers lived near sites
of power related to Ogrémoch, the Evil Elemental Prince of Earth, because modern
norkers are often found working for his cultists or those of the Elder Elemental
Eye, guarding his forgotten temples in another very obvious historical
reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norkers retain their conceptual role as rank-and-file opposition for
paragon-tier (AKA “name level”) characters, which in 4e means they’re much
stronger than they ever were. Their levels range from around 12 to 15 here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re Small Elemental Humanoids with Low-Light Vision and Speed 6, with
abilities combining martial training and minor earth magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;norker-stone-shield&quot;&gt;Norker Stone Shield&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone Shields look like an unruly mob at first glance, but they’re professional
soldiers trained by those elemental cults and other earth-themed villains. Their
training and equipment allows them to fight a bit like a roman legion, keeping
tight formations, throwing javelins and them closing in to batter enemies with
their short clubs and shields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone Shields are Level 12 Soldiers with 124 HP, which means a sizable group of
them can eat most typical human military units for breakfast. Their basic
attacks are a &lt;em&gt;club&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;javelin&lt;/em&gt;, both of which mark for a turn on a hit. If
a marked enemy adjacent to the norker shifts, it can attack them with a &lt;strong&gt;Shield
Slam&lt;/strong&gt; vs. Fortitude that damages and knocks prone on a hit. And if someone hits
them in melee they can respond with an &lt;strong&gt;Elemental Rebuke&lt;/strong&gt;, a reaction that
attacks AC and does some minor damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;norker-grunt&quot;&gt;Norker Grunt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, it seems stone shields are rarified elites. The actual rank and
file of a norker force will be made of of these guys, who are far less organized
and prefer to use “charging horde” tactics with their clubs. Their natural
strength and toughness still makes them a very hard problem for human
militaries, and even PCs don’t want to get surrounded by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grunts are Level 15 Minion Brutes, and their only active ability is their
&lt;strong&gt;Club&lt;/strong&gt; attack. Their &lt;strong&gt;Harrassing Brute&lt;/strong&gt; trait is what makes them truly
dangerous. All of the grunt’s allies get a damage bonus against enemies equal to
twice the number of grunts adjacent to that enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s unpack that for a moment. Let’s say 4 grunts are adjacent to the party’s
fighter. Each of those grunts will get a +8 damage bonus when they attack the
fighter. So will the grunt’s artillery and controller bosses who are 5 squares
away from this scrum. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, grunts want to slip past the front line and harrass the enemy
squishies, but as we can see from the example above they can still do pretty
well against defenders if Team Monster decides to focus fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;norker-stone-walker&quot;&gt;Norker Stone Walker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone Walkers norkers who received proper training in earth magic, and who
combine that with a mobile fighting style. They’re Level 15 Skirmishers with 150
HP. They can attack with &lt;strong&gt;handaxes&lt;/strong&gt; in melee or at range, doing extra damage
if they have combat advantage. They also have a +4 AC bonus against opportunity
attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magic-wise, they have the same &lt;strong&gt;Elemental Rebuke&lt;/strong&gt; reaction as the Stone
Shield, and they can also use &lt;strong&gt;Earth Glide&lt;/strong&gt; as a move action to move their
speed and phase through earth and rock during this movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last one makes them excellent additions to an underground encounter. Place
a couple of them behind a thin rock wall and have them flank the PCs after the
stone shields and grunts begin their frontal assault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tough norkers still fill more or less the same narrative role as before, they do
so in a very different way. I think my favorites are the grunts; the damage
bonus they grant is both very distinctive and terrifying to players. When
scaling their level, I’d probably make it +1/tier instead of a flat +2.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first I’ve heard of Nerras, though it’s possible they originated in
a previous edition. If they did, their lore was completely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many ages ago, a sect of mortal invokers called the Sect of Seventy came to
believe that the gods had grown too detached from the middle world in the
aftermath of the Dawn War. They had become incapable of defending it from the
many threats and hazards that lingered from those terrible battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sect of Seventy decided to claim for themselves the role of protectors of
the middle world, and set about building a grand work that would allow them to
keep watch over all reality. They used their divine magic to build an astral
dominion they named The Constellation of Eyes. Located far from all the other
known dominions, it consisted of a central reflective crystal sphere around
which orbited uncountable mirrors that reflected different parts of the universe
and could be used as portals to reach those places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the Constellation is the ultimate panopticon, capable of
maintaining surveillance over the entire universe and allowing its owners to
instantly deploy to places of interest. The Sect intended it to be the perfect
“superhero base” from which they would keep watch over reality, but other
interested parties had far more nefarious uses in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sect was unknowingly infiltrated by a small group of priests of Asmodeus,
who intended to seize it for themselves and use it to open a permanent portal to
the Nine Hells that would give devils free access to the rest of the
multiverse. The invokers only managed to discover this after the final ritual
had already began. The ensuing battle was every bit as epic as you imagine, and
the resulting flare of divine energy from both sides was strong enough for the
other gods to notice and send their angels to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The angels would have been a great help, but they arrived too late. As far as
they were able to determine, the invokers realized they were losing the battle,
and enacted a desperate ritual of their own that would bring terrible ruin upon
all that were in the Constellation of Eyes. The ritual worked. It turned both
the invokers and the Asmodean priests into the creatures now known as Nerras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These mirrored crystaline humanoids still dwell in the Constellation of
Eyes. With no apparent memory of their previous lives, they spent the following
eons acting as dispassionate observers of the multiverse. Their observations are
recorded in specially constructed glass tablets that can only be read from a
slanted angle, and their collected store of information is one of the greatest
in existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatively recently, though, the nerras have changed their behavior and become
more proactive. They’ve taken to crossing their mirror portals and kidnapping
certain powerful and influential individuals. Back at the Constellation, the
nerras use their magic to create a perfect duplicate of the subject, with a
diametrically opposite moral outlook. Then they send both back home. This
predictably causes a lot of problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nerras target both terrible villains and virtuous heroes in equal measure. Those
scholars aware of their history theorize that ancient memories of the nerras’
former lives are resurfacing and causing divisions among them, and that their
new activities are an experiment to see which between good and evil is stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nerras also travel to places they consider interesting to monitor things from up
close, and sometime they interfere in local events for inscrutable
reasons. Sometimes their interference ends up causing wars and disasters, some
times they prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nerras despise demons, devils, and creatures of the Far Realm, but they ally
with other creatures when their goals happen to align. Even their occasional
allies have little insight on their true motives, which they keep to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nerra are Medium Immortal Humanoids, with Speed 6 and human-standard
senses. Their signature ability is &lt;strong&gt;Mirror Step&lt;/strong&gt;, an at-will move action that
allows them to teleport 5 squares to a space adjacent to a mirror or to another
nerra. This means a group of nerras finds it very easy to maintain a cohesive
formation, and that their preferred battlegrounds have lots of mirrors that they
can use for extra mobility. All of the ones we see here are Unaligned, and they
speak Supernal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of their other abilities vary per stat block, though they all tend to share
a strong “mirror” theme. Their levels cover the mid-to-late Paragon tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;varoot-nerra&quot;&gt;Varoot Nerra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varoots are elite scouts and spies. They’re the first to venture forth from the
Constellation of Eyes to lay the groundwork for a nerra expedition. Their
ability to copy the appearances of others makes them great infiltrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varoot Nerras are Level 16 Lurkers with the Shapechanger keyword and 116
HP. Their main weapon is a &lt;strong&gt;shard blade&lt;/strong&gt; similar to a longsword. Their
&lt;strong&gt;Reflection Theft&lt;/strong&gt; ability allows them to perfectly duplicate an enemy within
10 squares of it. The effect lasts until the end of the encounter, or until the
varoot attacks. If the varoot is adjacent to the copying enemy, it gets to roll
a save against any melee or ranged attack that targets it, with a success
forcing the attack to target the copied enemy instead. It also gains a +2 bonus
to attack and a +5 bonus to damage against the copied enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its last ability aside from Mirror Step is &lt;strong&gt;Mirrored Grasp&lt;/strong&gt;, a minor-action
power that lets the nerra teleport an unattended object of up to 20 pounds /
10kg that’s within 10 squares and line of sight to its hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combat, the Varoot does it’s Lurker routine by “hiding” next to a PC it’s
copying, attacking the copied PC with a damage bonus, and teleporting away using
Mirror Step so it can transform and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no way to pierce the varoot’s disguise with a skill check, at least in
the ability’s combat form. It would make sense to rule that outside of combat
this works like a doppelganger’s transformation: it lasts a long time and can be
contested with Insight vs. the nerra’s Bluff of +20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meerak-nerra&quot;&gt;Meerak Nerra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeraks are the rank and file of a Nerra strike force. They charge into the
enemy to cut it up with their spiked, jagged bodies, softening them up for the
more powerful individuals that always follow close behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeraks are Level 18 Minion Soldiers. Their &lt;strong&gt;Mirror Slash&lt;/strong&gt; basic attacks mark
on a hit, and their &lt;strong&gt;Mirror Defense&lt;/strong&gt; ability is an interrupt that triggers
when they’re hit by a melee attack and deals 10 damage to a different enemy
within 10 squares. The meerak is still going to die from the hit, but not before
reflecting some damage to a PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kalareem-nerra&quot;&gt;Kalareem Nerra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kalareems are elite knights among the nerra. Unlike a lot of their crystalline
relatives, they look like they’re made out of mirror-smooth liquid metal. This
makes them hard to hurt, and they can also briefly solidify parts of their
bodies to launch a spray of deadly metal shards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kalareem Nerras are Level 19 Soldiers with 175 HP. Their liquid metal
construction doesn’t translate to specific abilities but it’s a nice
in-character explanation for the high defenses and HP a level 19 Soldier
has. Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Shard Blade&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and marks on a hit, as
do the &lt;strong&gt;Shard Blasts&lt;/strong&gt; they can fire at-will in a Close Burst 3 pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the standard nerra Mirror Step, they also have two other
mirror-themed abilities that make them good bodyguards. &lt;strong&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/strong&gt; is an
interrupt that triggers when a marked enemy makes a melee or ranged attack that
doesn’t include the nerra as a target. It makes the enemy target the nerra
instead. &lt;strong&gt;Mirror Defense&lt;/strong&gt; is another interrupt that triggers when the kalareem
is hit by a melee attack. The creature can then make an attack against the Will
of the triggering enemy, which on a hit deals the same damage inflicted by the
triggering attack. This is an interrupt, so the attacker gets damaged &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;
the nerra, and if they get reduced to 0 HP the kalareem wouldn’t suffer the
damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sillit-nerra&quot;&gt;Sillit Nerra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sillits are nerra spellcasters, who often act as field agents and
mystically-oriented scouts. Like other spellcasting monsters, out of combat they
should have access to whatever rituals are required by the story. In combat,
they use mirror-themed spells and specialize in forcibly teleporting enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sillits are Level 19 Controllers with 181 HP. Even their basic attack is a
&lt;strong&gt;Mirror Portal&lt;/strong&gt; that targets Will, and on a hit damages and teleports the
target adjacent to one of the sillit’s allies within 10 squares. Their basic
ranged attack is &lt;strong&gt;Warped Image&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets Fortitude and on a hit damages
and teleports the target 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their special attack is &lt;strong&gt;Captured Image&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), a ranged power that
targets Will. On a hit it removes the target from play (save ends), trapping it
within the mirrors that make up the sillit’s body. While the target is captured,
it takes 20 damage whenever the sillit is damaged. The effect ends when the
target successfully saves, or when the sillit is reduced to 0 HP. When this
happens the target appears on a square of the sillit’s choice within 5 squares
of the sillit itself. Yes, it’s entirely possible that a sillit who gets lucky
with its recharge rolls will manage to capture multiple targets at the same
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sillits have the standard Mirror Step power, and the same Mirrored Grasp power
of the Varoots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging from their powers, Sillits love to fight in maps containing plenty of
hazardous terrain, and accompanied by bruiser allies. They’ll use Captured Image
as soon and as often as they can, and then move to the front lines to dare PCs
to attack them. Inconveniently strong melee PCs can be teleported next to the
bruisers with Mirror Portal, and Warped Image is good for disrupting the
remaining PCs if no other opportunities arise. Hazardous terrain on the
battlefield makes those forced teleports more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;delphar-nerra&quot;&gt;Delphar Nerra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delphars are the officers and commanders of nerra forces. They’re similar to
kalareems in their training, but they’re much larger and their mere presence has
bolstering effects on the abilities of their allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other nerra, delphars are Large and have Speed 8. They’re Level 20
Soldiers with 187 HP and the Leader tag. They project a &lt;strong&gt;Mirrored Rampart&lt;/strong&gt;
aura (5) that extends the range of other nerras’ Mirror Step to 10. They fight
with a &lt;strong&gt;Shard Blade&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Shard Blasts&lt;/strong&gt; that have the same effects as those
of kalareems, with slightly higher numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a different way of punishing marked enemies, though: &lt;strong&gt;Mirrored
Grasp&lt;/strong&gt; triggers when a marked enemy within 10 squares ignores the mark, and
teleports the enemy adjacent to the delphar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;teltarym-nerra&quot;&gt;Teltarym Nerra&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would expect the strongest monster in the entry to be some sort of dread
overlord, but we’re talking about topsy-turvy mirror people here. Teltarym are
the nerra’s manual laborers, joining the fight either because they must defend
themselves or because they were ordered to. Despite not being formal combatants
they’re very strong and aggressive, charging in to smash enemies with their huge
fists, and reflecting their own wounds back at their attackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teltarym are Level 21 Brutes with 237 HP. Like delphars, they’re Large and have
Speed 8. Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Hammer Fist&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and pushes 1
square, and they can use it twice in the same action. &lt;strong&gt;Reflected Pain&lt;/strong&gt; is a
reaction that triggers when they’re hit by a melee attack, and which inflicts
half the damage they suffered to the attacker. This recharges when they’re first
bloodied. Their last ability is Mirror Step, so like most brutes they’re fairly
simple to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the perfect bruiser allies for Sillits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the lore of the nerra quite a lot. It’s nice and epic and introduces a
new and interesting location on the Astral Sea. I also like how they’re depicted
as enigmatic instead of evil. A campaign against nerra is one where violence
might be necessary to drive them off, but where true victory can only be
achieved through unraveling their mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanics wise it seems varoots are a bit too low level to hang out with their
nerra buddies, so you’re going to meet them alone at the start of a
nerra-focused story arc. They might be accompanied by local agents or
mecernaries. The others are all of a level range where you can use them to build
all-nerra encounter groups.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 1982, there was a movie named &lt;em&gt;The Dark Crystal&lt;/em&gt;. It introduced these
cool villainous vulture people called the Skeksis, which became kind of
iconic. D&amp;amp;D wanted in on some of that action, so it added a species called the
Nagpa to Mystara. Nagpas are to Skeksis what Halflings are to Hobbits, which
means that they started out just barely different enough to avoid a lawsuit and
got significantly changed in each subsequent edition. This is their 4e debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, during the Dawn War, the Primordials realized they needed
servitors that could act as special forces. They already commanded uncountable
hordes of elementals, but they were mostly dumb as rocks and only good as shock
troops. Giants and djinns were smart and individually powerful, but too few in
number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they decided to take a page from the playbook of the gods and create a
servitor species they named the nagpas. Created to be as beautiful as nymphs and
as clever as devils, the nagpas readily took to their new role and proceeded to
wreak havoc on the armies of the gods for a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when the Dawn War was nearing its end, the nagpas were clever enough to
realize that their side would lose. And so it was that they made a deal with the
gods to betray their masters. However, they were caught, and the primordials
cursed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curse took away the beauty of the nagpas, turning them into horrid
vulture-like beings. It also doomed them to never touch that which they desired
the most. A nagpa who loved fine food and wine would always taste foulness when
he tried to eat or drink. One who loved art would see it crumble at a touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagpas were either already immortal, or were made so by the curse. Even when
slain, they reincarnate within a few decades with all memories of their previous
lives and deaths. Every nagpa alive today remembers their life before the curse,
and is obsessed with those things it cannot have. They tend to destroy mirrors
or any other surface that can show them their own faces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primordial curse angle is interesting. Without it, you could argue that
their vulture-like appearance is a subjective thing. Some people think they’re
ugly, they themselves like it just fine. But a curse might make them
“axiomatically” ugly: not only are others unable to see beauty in them, they are
incapable of seeing it in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagpas are Medium Elemental Humanoids with Low-Light Vision and a speed
of 6. Everything else comes from training and varies per stat block. The two
stat blocks here have a wizardly bent, and use magic with a corruption and decay
theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nagpa-corruptor&quot;&gt;Nagpa Corruptor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nagpa Corruptor is given as an example of an art-loving nagpa. Its lair
looks like a museum, with cordoned-off works of art on display (but no
reflective surfaces!). It employs a large number with a similarly evil
disposition to protect its collection and acquire more pieces for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruptors are Level 9 Controllers with 97 HP. Their basic attacks are a
&lt;strong&gt;withering staff&lt;/strong&gt; that deals necrotic damage and pushes 2 squares, and a
ranged &lt;strong&gt;Withering Blast&lt;/strong&gt; that deals necrotic damage and immobilizes (save
ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also use a ranged &lt;strong&gt;Devouring Fire&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) spell that deals
fire damage and ongoing fire damage (save ends). Each failed save also deals a
bit of fire damage to up to 3 enemies adjacent to the target. The text says
“each ally” but I’m interpreting that to mean “each ally of the target”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their strongest attack is an encounter power named &lt;strong&gt;Corrupting Curse&lt;/strong&gt;, a close
blast 5 that deals necrotic damage and creates a zone that prevents enemies
inside from regaining HP. It lasts until the end of the encounter. Their other
encounter power is an &lt;strong&gt;Enervating Blast&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s another close blast 5 that can
be cast as a minor action, deals no damage and weakens those it hits for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruptors let their hired muscle do most of the fighting, hitting their enemies
with opportunistic spells from afar. They’re one of the rare monsters that
include more specific “director’s notes” in their text, though: if the fight
happens inside the corruptor’s lair/gallery, PCs should be able to its beloved
art objects. The first time one is destroyed, the corruptor becomes dazed for a
turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nagpa-carrion-lord&quot;&gt;Nagpa Carrion Lord&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a gourmand who loved good food and drink, but who is cursed to only
taste ashes and filth when it eats. It still likes holding feasts, but its
inability to enjoy them fill it with rage and frustration, which it takes out on
any nearby PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Carrion Lord is a Level 14 Artillery monster with 111 HP. All of its
abilities have a “rot” theme, starting with the &lt;strong&gt;Rotting Staff&lt;/strong&gt; basic melee
attack that targets Fortitude and does necrotic damage. Its basic ranged attack
is the &lt;strong&gt;Bolt of Putrescence&lt;/strong&gt;, targetting Reflex and doing, you guessed it,
necrotic damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand of Ruin&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) is a ranged attack that changes things up a
little and does acid damage. &lt;strong&gt;Consuming Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) is a ranged area
attack that deals immediate and ongoing necrotic damage, and creates a zone that
blocks line of sight to the carrion lord’s enemies. Its allies can see through
it just fine, though. It lasts for a turn and can be sustained with a minor
action. The lord’s last encounter power is &lt;strong&gt;Ghostly Escape&lt;/strong&gt;, a minor action
that gives it insubstantial and phasing for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Carrion Lord likely opens the fight with Consuming Shadows, and then keeps
using its two ranged attacks from beyond the sight of the PCs while its
melee-oriented bodyguards keep them pinned in place. Ghostly escape is reserved
for doing what its name says, and letting the nagpa get away after it sees the
fight is lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to say the same thing everyone who has reviewed a Nagpa entry always
says: they’re skeksis. The way in which they’re skeksis tends to vary with the
edition, though. I think the ones from the source material were pursuing
immortality. These ones achieved it, but found that it brings them no joy.&lt;/p&gt;
