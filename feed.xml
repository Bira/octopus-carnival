        <title>Let&apos;s Play Hell&apos;s Rebels: Player Character Origins</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell&apos;s_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell’s Rebels includes some traits in its Player’s Guide that can be assigned to
PCs to tie them to the campaign either by providing a motivation or by giving
them additional ways to contribute. A PC could be a minor worker in the opera,
or a fed-up citizen, or interested in the city’s history, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think those quite fit what I have in mind for my solo campaign. They are
suitable as backgrounds for level 1 starting characters and their mechanics can
be useful at the start, but pretty much cease to be a factor in the story once
the “main plot” kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being released six years earlier than Hell’s Rebels, the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/neverwinter/&quot;&gt;Neverwinter
Campaign Setting&lt;/a&gt; for D&amp;amp;D 4e does a much better job at allowing players to
create characters who are &lt;em&gt;deeply&lt;/em&gt; involved with the campaign at hand. More than
starting motivations, its character themes provide entire story arcs that will
remain relevant throughout the entire campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want the same thing for my game, so I’m going to replace the relatively
generic reasons given in the Hell’s Rebels player guide with something that’s
narratively on par with Neverwinter’s themes. I want them to not only be more
exciting, but also to reflect the increased starting power of Dungeon Fantasy
characters. They’re going to be key players in the rebellion from minute one of
the campaign. Why just be a random history buff when you can be The Last
Archivist instead? This status might be reflected in some of their traits, but
the story consequences are the main thing here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the “character themes” I intend to use. There are five, one for each of
my intended PCs, but presenting them separately will help provide some
inspiration to other GMs who want to do the same thing whether in GURPS or
another system. I’m using Dungeon Fantasy archetype and ancestry names instead
of those from Pathfinder, but the correlations should be pretty easy to
deduce. Each of them also has plot ties to some of the game’s possible allied
factions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each theme bellow includes a short background description, and paragraphs
listing prerequisites, benefits, and drawbacks. These are mostly story-related,
but they might also add optional mechanical traits to your character’s
template. You can buy these right away with your starting points, or buy them
later with earned points like any other template trait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sixth-raven&quot;&gt;The Sixth Raven&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most surviving historical documents about the Silver Ravens say they were five
in number: Jackdaw the elf swashbuckler, Amyreid the half-elf cleric, Ba the
halfling wizard, Kyda the human bard, and Brakisi the human scout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These documents were wrong. There was one other: you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were a small orphan child then, adopted by the group as a kind of mascot
somewhere along their career. You shared their love for Kintargo and its
freedom, but you were too young to go on any actual adventures, so you mostly
helped by running small errands, and heard from their big battles when they
returned to tell the tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lasted until the last battle, the one against the massed armies of House
Thrune. Jackdaw sent you away with many of her other non-combatant friends the
day before that one, promising she’d call you back when the danger was past. She
never did, because the Ravens lost. Jackdaw surrendered so that the demonic army
would spare the city, and the others were either killed by Thrune agents over in
subsequent years or disappeared forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the following decades you would finally reach adulthood and set out on your
own, becoming an adventurer of some skill and renown elsewhere in the Inner Sea
region. Now, you’re ready to return home and finish the work of your
old friends. Your name has been struck from the history books, but your passion
burns as brightly as it ever did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: You must belong to a species long-lived enough that you could
have been a child 70 years ago and still be of adventuring age in the
present. Being a dwarf or some kind of elf is enough, but the Half-Spirit
ancestries from DF 3 might also fit. Another alternative is to play a
&lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/02/07/warforged-variants.html&quot;&gt;Warforged&lt;/a&gt; who was an &lt;em&gt;active&lt;/em&gt; member of the Ravens and spent some of the
intervening decades disabled and unconscious, but was recently repaired. You can
belong to any profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: You remember things. The GM might occasionally give you hints and
clues about old Silver Raven safehouses and stashes. You also knew the Ravens
personally and they knew you - should any of them still be around, you will be
able to recognize each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add the Serendipity {15} trait to your template if it’s not already
present. This represents your memories of old Kintargo and Raven hangouts, and
might let you find useful shortcuts, items, and passages that are not
pre-written into the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt;: Things remember you. Demons, vampires, and other similarly
long-lived monsters who faced the original Ravens back in the day will recognize
you just as readily, and will be extra-mean to you as a result. Once word
spreads that you’re back, some of them might even travel to Kintargo for the
sole purpose of killing you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be represented by the Enemy (Monster of the Week, 9 or less) {-15}
trait, which gets added as an optional disadvantage to your template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only have the DFRPG, the disadvantage works like this: the GM rolls 3d6
in secret at the beginning of each adventure or each session of an extended
adventure. If the result is a 9 or less, a significantly powerful monster will
appear somewhere along the coming adventure or session, inserting itself into
one of the upcoming situations and making things more complicated and dangerous
for you and your group. It’s usually something complicated to fight, and not
necessarily the same monster every time. This is &lt;em&gt;in addition&lt;/em&gt; to any
pre-existing monsters in the adventure who recognize you and want you dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-last-archivist&quot;&gt;The Last Archivist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were a member of the Sacred Order of Archivists, a secret society made up of
worshipers of various deities of knowledge and wisdom. The Order was dedicated
to preserving the true history of Kintargo and other such “forbidden” knowledge
from Thrune redactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Order is no more: its hideout was raided and ransacked by Thrune forces
during the Night of Ashes. You were away when it happened, on a mission to
retrieve an important document in another city. That’s why you survived. When
you returned, you reached out to a few contacts and learned that some of your
colleagues have surviving family. They were nobles and their family estate was
razed during the Night of Ashes, but one of their sons is still at large. You
are now trying to find this son, help him stay safe, and then get revenge on
House Thrune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: None! While the Order is an excellent origin for Clerics,
Wizards, and other big brains, it could easily have employed fightier or
sneakier types as security or retrieval specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s impossible to be a member of the Archivists and not learn
&lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. In addition to being familiar with the Order’s hideout and its
procedures, you also know a bit of the region’s unredacted history and a few
other tidbits of unrelated but potentially useful knowledge. You can recognize
the Sixth Raven if run into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add the History and Research skills as an option to your template, and
also all specialties of Hidden Lore if they aren’t there already. You also add
Wild Talent {20} as an optional advantage, representing a large trove of random
knowledge. If you’re using the Basic Set, add Intelligence Analysis to your
template as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt;: You’re riven by grief and driven by revenge against Barzilai
Thrune and his minions. This might manifest as Intolerance (Diabolists) {-5}, an
Obsession (depose Thrune)(12) {-10}, or both! The Obsession might seem redundant
since it’s also the overall campaign goal, but it also compels you to take
potentially risky and unwise courses of action if they seem like they will yield
quicker results. It could also prevent you from retreating from a fight against
Thrune’s minions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;knight-of-the-deep&quot;&gt;Knight of the Deep&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You come from one of the subaquatic communities off the coast of Ravounel, where
you enjoy an heroic reputation. You recently went to visit your friend Aava in
the coastal village of Acisazi, only to find her missing and the village
suffering under a strange malaise. The village’s elder told you Aava had led a
small party of scouts into Kintargo to ask seek help breaking the curse, but she
never reported back. She begged you to find Aava, and you accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You arrive at this land-lubber town to find it embroiled in a lot more trouble
than you thought possible. Aava is nowhere to be found and neither is her
contact, the singer Shensen. You suspect both of them vanished into the prisons
of the despotic Barzilai Thrune, and your queries have led you to the Aria Park
protest. You suspect you might need to bloody this human despot’s nose to
fulfill your mission, and that’s just fine with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: You must belong to a species capable of breathing underwater!
Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level contains two possible choices here: the Sea
Elf and the Water-Infused. From this blog, you might also pick the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html&quot;&gt;Argonian&lt;/a&gt;
or perhaps a Warforged who has been modified to be hydrodynamic and Amphibious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This theme is open to any profession, but martial types should probably keep in
mind the rules for &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html&quot;&gt;underwater combat for fish-people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: The people of Acisazi know and trust you, and Aava is your good
friend (or even a relative if you’re also a sea elf).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add Swimming, Aquabatics and Survival (Undersea) to your template as
optional skills, and should probably put some points in them during character
creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt;: Add Obsession (find Aava and her scouts) (12) {-5} to your
template as an optional disadvantage. It’s what you already want to do anyway,
but like the Last Archivist’s Obsession it might drive you to unwise actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;phantom-thief&quot;&gt;Phantom Thief&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are one of Lady Docur’s School for Girls’ most distinguished graduates. You
had parted ways with your alma mater and set up shop in nearby Vyre, but a
recent letter from Lady Docur herself brought you back to Kintargo. The city’s
political climate is getting rather inhospitable to the school, and she hopes
you will be able to help them survive these turbulent times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words: the school is currently the closest thing Kintargo has to a
thieves’ guild. They specialize in training secret couriers and the nicer sort
of thief. Thrune prefers the &lt;em&gt;nasty&lt;/em&gt; sort of thief, so things might get
difficult for the school and its students. That’s where you come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you’re not here just to help your old school. You’re also, er, taking
a breather from some rather complex entanglements you left behind in the good
city of Vyre. Hopefully it will be a long while before you have to set foot
there again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s a school for girls, which means you either are a woman
or only discovered you &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; after graduation. You must also be some manner
of Thief, either the base template or one of the variants from the corresponding
Dungeon Fantasy Denizens book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: You know Lady Docur and other characters associated with your alma
mater, and have their trust. You also know Vyre’s customs, which might come in
handy if you ever need to go back there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add Area Knowledge and Current Affairs for both Kintargo and Vyre to your
template, as well as Connoisseur, Savoir-Faire and the Fashion Sense
advantage. The School does give one a proper high society education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt;: Those Vyre entanglements will come back to haunt you if you ever
return there during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No extra disadvantages here: everything which could make a thief’s life harder
is already part of the relevant templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mysterious-satirist&quot;&gt;Mysterious Satirist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even before Barzilai Thrune rolled in like he owned the place, you were already
well-known among Kintargo’s rebels, malcontents, and antifascists. Whether you
make poems, plays, essays, or songs, your work criticizing House Thrune was on
everybody’s minds and the pseudonym you chose for yourself was spoken in the
same tones as that of The Poison Pen and other such figures. Thrune’s opponents
speak it with admiration; his supporters, with disgust. That’s how you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While no one has figured who you are yet, Barzilai’s arrival and the Night of
Ashes have made your life very difficult already. Most of your contacts among
Kintargo’s several resistance organizations have vanished, left town, or gone to
ground. While you still value your art, you also feel it’s time to engage in
more direct action against this dictator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt;: None! While Bards obviously have a head start in terms of the
artistic skills implied by this theme, the Mysterious Satirist could be anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;: Choose one of the Bellflower Network, the Cult of Sarenrae, the
Rose of Kintargo, or the Poison Pen. You’re indirectly acquainted with that
group or individual. Though you have never met, you have corresponded and set up
pre-arranged signs that will let you recognize each other when the meeting does
happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add the artistic or performance skills of your choice to your template, as well
as an appropriate Talent covering them to your optional advantages. Writing,
Poetry, and Musical Composition are appropriate if you share your work through
in written form. Public Speaking, Singing, Acting and Musical Instrument are
also good if you actually perform it. If you have the GURPS Basic Set, you can
also add Artist to the list of possible artistic skills, and you also add
Propaganda no matter what your medium is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawbacks&lt;/strong&gt;: Add a 10-point Secret (Mysterious Satirist), Selfless, and
Trickster to your optional disadvantage list if they are not already there. The
first represents the risk of bad things happening when the authorities discover
who you are, above and beyond what being a Silver Raven would bring. The other
two represent possible reasons for you to have chosen this path in the first
place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Play Hell&apos;s Rebels: Adjusting Setting Assumptions</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell&apos;s_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s time for me to put on my GM hat and begin preparing my solo Hell’s Rebels
campaign. As mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/07/08/lets-play-hells-rebels.html&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I want to play this using the
GURPS Dungeon Fantasy rule set instead of the campaign’s native Pathfinder
1e. Let’s take a look at what this means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait a minute! Wasn’t that previous most published more than a year ago?
Well, turns out I started writing this one shortly after publishing it, but one
thing and another got in the way and I’m only getting around to publishing it
now. I’m actually a fair bit along in campaign preparation and even started
playing, I’m just behind on documenting the process. Anyway, let’s keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-setting&quot;&gt;The Setting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we all know by now, Hell’s Rebels takes place in Golarion, Pathfinder’s
setting. Golarion was built from the ground up to support dungeon fantasy
campaigns so we don’t have any fundamental friction between it and the Dungeon
Fantasy rules. Despite the many D&amp;amp;D-isms of Pathfinder’s first edition we
already know the setting can easily be used with other systems, since it has an
official Savage Worlds port and Paizo itself is in the process of removing those
D&amp;amp;D-isms from the latest iteration of their house system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I do want to make a few changes to the version I’m going to
use. The most obvious one is I’m going to drop the many different fiend
classifications from D&amp;amp;D and Pathfinder in favor of Dungeon Fantasy’s
simplified “it’s all demons from Hell”. Any of the demons from DF will be fair
game as opposition here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since I’m talking about setting changes, any mention I find of Cheliax’s
fascists and diabolists being in any way “disciplined” or “organized” despite
their evil will be altered because incompetence, corruption, and a disregard for
any rules lies at the heart of fascism. These fucks do not make the trains run
on time and never have. You do not, at any point, gotta hand it to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to lean on the similarities between this campaign and Assassin’s
Creed Brotherhood, so we’ll be at a Renaissance tech level with early guns
widely available to guards and rebels. Make ready your blessed bullets, o devil
hunters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mechanics&quot;&gt;The Mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this will mostly be pretty simple, because this won’t be the first time
I’m converting between Pathfinder and DF. I did already run the first two
volumes of Hell’s Rebels and the first three volumes of Iron Gods to different
player groups. During those times two issues jumped at me as being the most
difficult to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one was treasure conversions, but I think I’ve arrived at a satisfying
process for that &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/06/25/dungeon-fantasy-wealth.html&quot;&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;. Our delvers will eventually end up very
wealthy, but I imagine the rebellion will prove to be a great money sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other difficulty concerns the only somewhat common part of the dungeon
delving experience that’s harder to do in Dungeon Fantasy than in D&amp;amp;D:
underwater adventures. There’s a couple of extended underwater segments in the
middle of the adventure path, and Pathfinder’s default items and spells for it
are a lot more accessible than Dungeon Fantasy’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey, it turns out I already solved that too! &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html&quot;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; collects the
underwater rules I’ll be using, and &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/11/13/underwater-items.html&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; has a nice set of more
accessible items to let our PCs go for a swim and live to tell the tale. The
truth is that I started writing this post before I wrote the underwater ones, so
they were actually part of my effort to figure this campaign out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monster conversions used to be a big problem back when I started the Let’s Read,
but now I have enough DF monster books that I can swipe appropriate stat blocks
for nearly every one of them. If I need to create new ones for specific foes,
you can be sure I’ll post them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coming-up-next&quot;&gt;Coming up Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Character themes! Everybody loves character themes!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Denizens of the Sea</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve published an article about &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html&quot;&gt;underwater adventuring&lt;/a&gt; in the past, in
which I mentioned that “fish-people” had several advantages over “land-lubbers”
when it came to mobility and fighting in an underwater environment. A later post
included &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/11/13/underwater-items.html&quot;&gt;a few items&lt;/a&gt; that could help those land-lubbers close the
gap… so how about we take a look at those fish-people now? As a bonus, you get
a nice little bundle of setting info you can drop on your campaign if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fate-of-atlantis&quot;&gt;The Fate of Atlantis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name “Atlantis” figures in the myths and legends of many more places than it
should. Cultures that have never heard of each other have stories about an
empire that ruled the waves in ancient times but no longer exists. The stories
might differ but the name is always the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because ancient Atlantis was the largest and most powerful underwater
civilization to ever exist. They discovered a means of traveling to other worlds
and exploited it with gusto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its power Atlantis eventually fell, as all empires do. The exact
sequence of events is more or less impossible to piece together, and mostly
irrelevant in the present day. The important bit is that their inter-world
travel network was the first thing to go, instantly fragmenting the
empire. That’s why each of them has a different story about how Atlantis fell -
those stories talk only about the bits of it they knew about. In some, it
happened overnight due to a cataclysm. In others, they eventually morphed into
successor cultures that might still be extant in the present day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from giving rise to a whole bunch of legends and to fueling the occasional
would-be despot’s ambitions, the most enduring legacy of Atlantis was its
underwater engineering. They pioneered a lot of the techniques that used to make
sturdy weapons and tools out of implausible aquatic materials like bone, shell,
coral, and mother-of-pearl. They were also the first civilization to
successfully make and work orichalcum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’re not here to talk about &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;, we’re here to talk about &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-lets-talk-about-people&quot;&gt;So Let’s Talk About People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinions differ on whether Atlantis was a Golden Age utopia or a despotic empire
whose downfall was a blessing to the world, but everyone agrees it was pretty
diverse. Unlike most typical dungeon fantasy kingdoms, its citizens belonged to
many different species with none of them making up an overwhelming majority of
the population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of Atlantis’ citizens can be described using already-published stats. Sea
Elves and Water-Infused from GURPS DF 3: The Next Level fit very well, as do the
Argonians from &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. The octopus- and shark-folk from GURPS Banestorm
are also good fits, though they’re a bit more complex and costly than the
standard for DF racial templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are a few new templates, with the overall goal of allowing a diverse
all-underwater party if the group wants to play that type of campaign. A couple
of the new ancestries I present here might have equivalent official templates
already, but since I don’t have those I’m writing new ones for my own use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These templates assume that being Amphibious also makes you able to see and hear
unimpeded while submerged, and the ability to breathe underwater also makes you
able to speak there. I feel this is in line with the simpler feel of Dungeon
Fantasy. If you want to follow Banestorm’s assumptions instead, give all
templates here one level of Nictitating Membrane {1} and Speak Underwater {5},
increasing their costs by 6 points each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;atlantean-20-points&quot;&gt;Atlantean (20 points)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This template describes people who are a product of successive generations of
intermarriage between the other species that made up the population of Atlantis,
and possibly some surfacers too. They are known as “Atlanteans” because their
general look became associated with that empire. Surprisingly, they look a lot
like humans even when they have no humans among their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlanteans are warm-blooded, have legs, and can breathe both water and
air. Their human-looking bits exhibit the same ethnic variety as
humans. Individuals can also have a variable number of “fishy” traits like visible
gills, fins, blue or gray skin, and so on. These might be visually striking but
are never significant enough to count as more than 0-point features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlanteans can appear in worlds that had an Atlantis, or those whose underwater
peoples are generally friendly with each other. The base stats could also be
used as they are or modified a bit to represent any species of underwater
humanoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Amphibious {10}, Gills {10}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Traits&lt;/strong&gt;: Those fishy bits might count as varying levels of Unnatural
Features in a setting where almost everyone is human and the character is the
only known Atlantean, but in all other situations they’re 0-point traits. If the
character has something like rigid fins or a prominent tail growing out of their
lower back, they might need adapted body armor. This doesn’t cost extra, but
might restrict their usage of looted armor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crab-folk-40-points&quot;&gt;Crab-Folk (40 points)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crab-folk are sapient humanoid crustaceans easily distinguished by their heavy
segmented carapaces. Like crabs, they lack distinct heads and their eyes are
located at the end of a pair of flexible, retractable stalks. Unlike crabs, they
only have the usual complement of humanoid limbs, though these are still
armored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crab-folk can operate normally on the surface, but their gills begin to dry out
if they go more than a day without being immersed in sea water. This means they
tend to stick close to the coast. Their voices sound strange and “bubbly”
outside the water, which most surfacers find off-putting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: 360-degree Vision {25}; Amphibious {10}; Gills {10}; Damage
Resistance 5 (Cannot Wear Armor) {15}; No Neck {5};&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Cold-Blooded {-5}; Disturbing Voice (In Air, -50%) {-5},
Dependency (Sea water, Daily) {-15}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional Traits&lt;/strong&gt;: If your campaign takes place far from a coastal area, the
Dependency disadvantage is worth -30 points, and the template therefore costs
only 25. Your local alchemist can prepare a solution close enough to seawater to
satisfy the requirement, but it’s still not free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deep-ones-50-points&quot;&gt;Deep Ones (50 points)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These humanoids are much more obviously “fishy” than Atlanteans, with an anatomy
closer to that of an abyssal fish than a human’s. They’re adapted to the
lightless depths of the ocean and that’s where they prefer to make their
homes. Deep Ones can swim up to the shallows without suffering ill effects, but
can’t breathe air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Atlantis fell, it was not uncommon for its Deep One settlements to become
more isolated and break contact with shallower or surface communities. This some
times gave rise to sinister legends and rumors about what they got up to down
there. These are mostly bunk: they are no more prone to worshiping Elder Things
than any other species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Amphibious {10}, Dark Vision {25}, Fangs {2}, Gills {0},
Pressure Support 3 {15}, Tough Skin 1 {3}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Cold-Blooded {-5}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional Traits&lt;/strong&gt;: A variant that can operate on the surface would be closer
to several classic D&amp;amp;D fish-people. They have the 10-point version of Gills and
so cost that much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;merfolk-20-points&quot;&gt;Merfolk (20 points)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merfolk are humanoid from the waist up and have fish bodies from the waist
down. They can breathe both air and water and have naturally melodious voices in
both mediums, but they require magic or assistive devices like wheelchairs to
operate on land. Their human halves display the same variance as Atlanteans, and
their fish halves can resemble a variety of species of fish, shark, or cetacean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;: Gills {10}, Voice {10}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/strong&gt;: No Legs (Aquatic) {0}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features&lt;/strong&gt;: The “Leg” and “Foot” hit locations on merfolk refer to their tail
and lower fins instead. Armor for those locations must be specially
constructed. As usual this doesn’t cost extra but limits which looted armor they
can use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optional Traits&lt;/strong&gt;: If your character’s fish half mimics a particularly speedy
species, they might have Enhanced Move 1 (Water) for an extra 20 points. At the
GM’s option, this might be a matter of training instead of biology, which means
any merfolk character can buy this with earned points as a power-up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackaton: Hard Wired Island</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/hard-wired-island-cover.png&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Hard Wired Island&apos;s cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard Wired Island is a cyberpunk game published by Weird Age Games in 2020. It’s
a beefy 400 page tome comparable in size to the Shadowrun or CP RED cores, but
only about 25% of that is rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard Wired Island takes place in Grand Cross, an O’Neil Cylinder habitat
orbiting Earth’s Lagrange 5 point, in the “distant future” of 2020. It was built
according to an idealistic plan in the wake of terrible environmental and
economic disasters on Earth, but is currently in the process of being co-opted
and corrupted by the interests of ultra-rich corporations and elites. The way in
which this is happening is described in very realistic detail throughout the
book, which also talks a bit about what people do to fight back. PCs are usually
expected to help in that fight, if not for moral reasons then because those
billionaires cause constant economic shocks that threaten their survival. This
is the main conflict in the setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grand Cross has cybernetic implants, gene editing, fully sapient AI and
androids. However its “global net” is still pretty much the internet
of 2020. It’s even &lt;em&gt;named&lt;/em&gt; “the internet”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every building in the station is wired for high-speed internet. The airwaves are
serviced by cell carriers like the ones you know from the real world, and some
of its wards even have free public wi-fi, though that tends to be poor quality
because capitalism is the worst virus. The station is linked to Earth’s internet
by satellites, with a 1.2-second lag there due to the physical distances
involved. Most big services have station-local data centers to try and get
around this, and there are some GC-native ones as well like HeoCities (website
hosting) and Pulser (a Crosser social network).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers are simply called hackers. Their equipment is collectively known as a
Hacking Suite, and it can be anything from computers that wouldn’t look out of
place here in the real world to some fancy cybernetic implant. Target systems
tend to be private corporate intranets or other networks located on the station,
and whether hacking is done remotely or on-site depends on the specific mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most tests in Hard Wired Island use 2d6, with bonuses coming from one of the
PC’s main stats/approaches (Cool, Clever, Tough, and Quick), from a skill
specialty, from Augments (implants), and from Assets, which are special
equipment. There are rules for rolling with advantage/disadvantage (add a d6 and
drop the lowest/highest) or for Boosting rolls (add a d6, don’t drop
anything). Criticals happen when two or more dice roll the same value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system for hacking is a mixture of the systems for stealth and social
interaction. It has a set of specific actions associated with it, but also uses
some actions from those other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers begin each hacking attempt in a state called “Ghost”, meaning they
haven’t been detected by the target system’s security. They also begin with
three chances to avoid getting caught. Every time a hacker needs to do something
that requires a die roll, they might get caught if that test fails, and must
spend a chance in order to avoid that. If they fail a roll after running out of
chances, they’re discovered and their physical location is traced. Security is
on its way, but the hacker can still disconnect and try to run. A hacker can try
a Cover Your Tracks action to restore lost chances, but that’s also a roll so it
might backfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Target networks have two stats: a Network Level that determines the basic
difficulty of all tests made against it, and a Mood that describes the
strictness of its security procedures and how willing it is to let you do
things. Hacking is mostly about improving the network’s Mood towards
you. &lt;em&gt;Friendly&lt;/em&gt; networks are helpful, giving Advantage for data searches within
then. &lt;em&gt;Indifferent&lt;/em&gt; networks neither help nor hinder. &lt;em&gt;Hostile networks&lt;/em&gt; assume
everyone is an intruder until they can prove otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most networks start out Indifferent, and their mood can be improved to Friendly
through hacking actions, or degrade to Hostile by failures. Hostile networks
can’t have their mood improved except by gaining admin access. This can be done
by succeeding at a number of rolls equal to its Network Level, but it’s not
strictly necessary to accomplish your goals. Admin access on a network makes it
Friendly, and prevents its mood from lowering. Doing anything in there becomes
almost trivial and you only need to maintain Ghost if someone intelligent is
monitoring the network (like another admin or an AI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no deadly ice here, and no cybercombat at all. Getting discovered and
traced is usually enough of a threat here, since those armed goons will kill you
just as dead, and the heightened state of alertness from the target will also
complicate your teammates’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard Wired Island tries to abstract the extensive planning sessions players of
other games engage in with a resource named “Prep”. Before the mission itself
you use actions to gather both Individual and Group Prep, and you spend those
points during missions to use your Assets or acquire new ones on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do have a sample hacker here, the ever adorable Maru. Her Hacking Suite is
built into her cybereyes but she still operates it with a keyboard. She will be
going with the team on this one, which might mean leaving that keyboard behind
but won’t affect her effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will once again go with three separate target networks here. The office
network is level 5 and Friendly to access from the inside; the security network
used by the guards is Indifferent and level 6; and the isolated server is
Hostile and level 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the first two detect intrusion they grow Hostile, trace Maru’s location, and
notify both the guards and the police. If the secret server detects intrusion it
will destroy itself in a very messy and noisy fashion, drawing guard
attention. This counts as a mission failure for our purposes, since the team
will spend the rest of the run trying to leave the office without the evidence
they came here to collect. As these are separate networks they have separate
Ghost counters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in our series we’ll have to concern ourselves with stuff that
happens before the mission itself. Let’s make an Individual Prep roll for
Maru. She’s getting her software in order before the run, at her hacker den. We
roll 2d6 + Clever + Hacking + Hacker’s Den against a difficulty of 7, and get
a 11. Since this is the first Prep roll we’re making, Maru gains 1 automatic
Prep, and an extra 1 Prep for beating the difficulty by 4. She takes part in
Group Prep later, and let’s say they agree to leave 1 of those points for her
use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the actual run. As always, the rest of the team manages to bullshit the
receptionist and make into the office posing as a repair crew. Maru locks
herself into a stall in the ladies’ room and begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The security network isn’t advertising itself, so I rule Maru needs a Search
roll to find it. Her bonus here is +3 from Clever and +2 from Hacking; the
difficulty is 11 (the network’s level + 5). She succeeds with 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there’s a lot she must do in this net, we spend 1 of her 3 Prep to
activate the Data Bomb program Asset, which gives her Advantage on her next
three rolls here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rule that opening the door and turning off the camera each require an Operate
roll. From what I see in the rules this seems to use the Drone specialty instead
of Hacking. Maru doesn’t have that, so she’s rolling only 2d6+3 from her
Clever. Thankfully, the Data Bomb still gives her Advantage on these rolls. She
succeeds at both rolls with a 12 and a 11, precisely because of that Advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maru and her team move to the records room, and find the secret server. She
jacks into it and begins searching for the data. The difficulties here are all
12 from the Network Level. Maru spends another Prep to activate the Ghost
Protocol program, giving her Advantage on her next Hacking roll and an extra
Ghost chance. These rolls &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use her Hacking specialty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advantage once again lets her succeed with a 14. I think succeeding at this lets
her take the data? Let’s be cruel instead and ask for a Spoof roll to download
the data without authorization. This is a Hostile server after all. No more
advantage here, but she still gets a 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team leaves the records room and Maru connects to the security wifi to open
the exit door. She still has one roll with Advantage remaining from her use of
Data Bomb, and succeeds on the Spoof roll with a 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the way out secured, she searches the office network for the money. No roll
needed to locate it, it’s Friendly and advertising itself to people inside the
office premises. A Search with Advantage lets her find the money with a roll of
11 versus the network’s lower difficulty of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has no advantage for the Spoof roll to transfer the money elsewhere, but she
still succeeds with a 11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mission accomplished! Time elapsed: around 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-analysis&quot;&gt;Run Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard Wired Island feels more complex than Neon City Overdrive in its
presentation, but the hacking sequence here was about as fast. This was in part
due to good rolls all through the run, but a failure here would have had less
impact than in my Neon City run. There, a failed roll would have meant
cybercombat, a system I didn’t get to try at all. Here it would have meant an
extra roll or two as I lost one of my Ghost points and retried the test. Perhaps
I’d have spent another action or two recovering those points as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping it to about one roll per Thing You Do seems to be key to keeping hacking
brief.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read Neverwinter: Veil and Surcross</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;And finally we get to look at the Thayan cities and the road between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;veil&quot;&gt;Veil&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town of Veil is so named because it’s built atop a stable rift to the
Shadowfell, which makes it look like it’s covered by a veil of shadows from
afar. This is where Shadowfell Road ends. Valindra’s people are very aware of
that, so they’re busy fortifying the town and bringing in undead defenders to
gradually replace its living garrison. Should the down fall or the rift close,
their Neverwinter contingent would be cut off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rift also protects Veil from direct bombardment by the flying fortress, as
it makes its shadow-powered projectiles go astray. Its defenses cannot stand up
to a Netherese ground assault, but the attacking army would risk getting caught
between Veil’s defenders and a relief force sent from Surcross. The fortress
therefore focuses on the bigger town, but sometimes comes here to float
ominously over Veil and throw some rocks at it. As we saw before it does this
when it needs to take in supplies, as its own Shadowfell portals require
proximity to a rift to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city’s defenses are led by a priest of Bane named Renault Abrecht, who
coordinates everything from the local temple he took over. When not doing that,
Abrecht spends his time ensuring the forces under his command are more loyal to
him than to Thay, and acquiring more converts from the town’s stressed-out
population. When he judges he has a big enough army of followers, he will cross
into Shadowfell Road and collapse the rift behind him, hoping to conquer a
kingdom for himself elsewhere in Faerûn. The Netherese would actually love that,
as it would achieve their own goal of cutting off Valindra’s supply route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-road&quot;&gt;The Road&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road linking Veil and Surcross is warded and trapped to a frankly ridiculous
level, because the Thayans rightly fear that if it got taken then Veil would
fall soon after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sides of the road are lined with stakes upon which are impaled
bodies. These are enchanted to animate, jump from the stakes, and kill anyone
who attacks the town of Veil or a Thayan national while on the road. Under the
road itself are a series of deadly necromantic rune traps that activate when
anyone living steps on them. They deactivate for five minutes if an &lt;em&gt;undead&lt;/em&gt;
being steps on them, so caravans to and from Surcross use zombie guides to
travel the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it’s possible for the PCs to travel overland between the two cities
without using the road, since by this point they should be able to navigate the
area’s environmental hazards without much trouble. Armies, however, would prefer
to use the road if they can, and supply caravans must use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;surcross&quot;&gt;Surcross&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tam was smart enough to foresee any serious attack against Thay would have to go
through Surcross, so he had potent defenses installed in the city a long time
ago. However he couldn’t imagine that the actual attack would come in the form
of a whole Netherese flying fortress, and the particulars of that attack lead to
the current stalemate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surcross is a town under permanent martial law. It’s governed by the military
garrison stationed here to fight the Netherese. Its civilian population is
suffering greatly because the soldiers requisition all the food for themselves,
and don’t hesitate to kill any who complain about it or displease them in other
ways. A dead Thayan is just an undead Thayan in waiting, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting into the town is hard and will require some ingenuity from the
party. Once inside, though, they can easily pass for residents, because who in
their right mind would want to break &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; the place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town’s governor is Ukulsid, an undead gnoll general who is entirely focused
on the war effort, and therefore dislikes the fact that his town also became the
center of Valindra’s schemes. His loyalty to Tam forces him to obey her, though,
because she outranks him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;external-defenses&quot;&gt;External Defenses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gates of Surcross are made of necromantically animated bone. They open and
close themselves at the orders of Thayan military necromancers, and will attack
others who linger close to them for too long like the animated wall traps we saw
earlier in the Dread Ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wall surrounding Surcross is pretty solid, and also festooned with hundreds
of hidden crypts. If the wall is breached or bypassed by enemy forces, a single
command will trigger a selective zombie apocalypse. Every corpse within the wall
will be animated and the shambling army will be sent into the town to kill every
non-Thayan they find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fingers-of-szass-tam&quot;&gt;Fingers of Szass Tam&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These five bone and marble towers are the reason Surcross hasn’t been flattened
yet. Located at equidistant points around the perimeter of the city wall, they
can project force fields over the city. They can’t cover the whole city for
long, so the towers usually project stronger but smaller fields over whatever
parts of it are being bombarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The towers have no windows, but their walls are enchanted to “not exist” to
anyone inside them. They’re filled with arcane artillery pieces similar to those
that defend the plateau, whose crews can see and fire through the walls just
fine. They also have assault units ready to deploy to anywhere inside the city
or to just outside its walls by marching on force field bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-garrison&quot;&gt;The Garrison&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important structure in Surcross’ defense, the garrison houses all living
Thayan troups stationed in town. It’s guarded around the clock by undead. Its
barracks are not segregated by gender, but by species: human, orc/half-orc,
gnoll, and “other”. It has short-range teleportation circles that can move
soldiers instantly to the front gate or to any of the five Fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particularly luxurious section of the garrison is reserved for the Sunmasters,
a contingent of Bane clerics and star warlocks who specialize in radiant
attacks. They mostly work as a special strike force against the Shadovar, or
when there’s an emergency and they need every soldier in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-tombstone&quot;&gt;The Tombstone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This squat fortress at the very center of town is where its leadership
resides. Its windows and doors can be commanded to meld into the walls and
disappear, allowing it to serve as a last redoubt if the wall is breached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ukulsid holds court here and lets people petition him for judgment on disputes
or to make other requests and complaints, but since he tends to draft those who
annoy him into the army, few people make use of the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building also contains an enchanted audience chamber that’s a perfect
replica of the one Szass Tam uses in his palace. It’s one of many such chambers
spread throughout Thay. The lich can sit in his throne in the original chamber
and establish a link with any of the replicas, causing an illusion of him to
appear on the corresponding throne. This lets him talk to anyone inside the
replica chambers as if he was there, and lets him forcibly teleport people
inside the replica chamber to the original one if he wants. Ukulsid occasionally
uses this room to report to his boss. PCs should probably avoid lingering here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valindra has an area reserved for her use underneath the Tombstone as well. This
currently stores a large and still growing collection of dragon bones, guarded
by skeletal guardians hidden among them. Valindra is stocking up in preparation
for the time when she learns the ritual to raise dracoliches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surcross looks like an even worse place than Evernight, and that’s saying
something. PCs who make it inside the walls will have some freedom of movement,
but still their stay there will resemble a dungeon delve more than a city
adventure. Nowhere is safe, no one can be trusted, and you ideally want to do
what you came to do and leave as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs main reason for coming to Thay is to disrupt the Thayan supply lines,
then Veil is probably their best bet, since the portal can be closed without
them needing to destroy either city. If the GM says Valindra’s Soul Vessel is
here in Thay, though, then its most likely hiding place is her bone collection
under Surcross’ Tombstone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read Neverwinter: Kolthunral, the Flying Fortress</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kolthunral is the Netherese flying fortress currently besieging Surcross. We’ll
look at it first because it kinda dominates the skyline and its goals are
important to contextualize everything else that’s going on in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrival of the fortress was a complete surprise even to Szass Tam, who
considered the current conflict with the Netherese to be a distant and minor
dispute over Shadowfell supply routes way off to the west in Neverwinter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That conflict is happening because, as we already know, both sides have ongoing
plots happening in the Neverwinter area and need a constant influx of material
and personnel from home: Valindra’s group is at the Dread Ring, and Clariburnus’
group is at Xinlenal. The Prince of Shade evidently disagreed with the lich
about the importance of the dispute and dispatched the fortress to solve it once
and for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many rumors and theories about why Szass Tam hasn’t gotten personally
involved in this battle. Some say that if he did it would attract the collective
attention of the other Princes of Shade and lead to one of those Realms-scouring
epic level wars everyone wants to avoid. Others say he realized all of this is
ultimately Valindra’s fault and he wants to see how she gets out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kolthunral is captained by Duchess Antheriss, one of Prince Caliburnus’
subordinates. She was a shadar-kai in life, and is now a Spirit Devourer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;construction&quot;&gt;Construction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kolthunral uses the same principles as any Netherese flying enclave to stay in
the air, with a &lt;em&gt;mythalar&lt;/em&gt; and everything. The thing that makes it atypical is
that it’s thoroughly militarized. Most of the inhabitants are soldiers, and the
rest are only here to work support jobs for the army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom of the flying island is encased in thick enchanted metal armor, and
the city has towers jutting out at all angles (even from the bottom) festooned
with siege and anti-air artillery similar to the engines used by Thay to defend
its borders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spatial-distortions&quot;&gt;Spatial Distortions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interior of the fortress is partly made of shadow-stuff that warps and
distorts space, meaning it’s bigger on the inside and can actively misdirect and
confuse intruders. The same techniques were used to build its ultimate weapons,
the meteor tubes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meteor tubes are, well, straight metal tubes that connect the inside of the
fortress to circular hatches in its bottom armor. Their enchantments make them
“ritual paths” very similar to the Shadowfell Road. You drop a big rock through
the entry hole of a meteor tube, and it falls an unfathomable distance through
the weirdest and most inhospitable reaches of the Shadowfell, coming out the
exit hatch at a speed many times greater than terminal velocity. They’re hard to
aim precisely, but the kinetic energy of an impact is so big it can obliterate
everything within a few dozen yards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A meteor salvo could flatten Surcross or Veil if it hit directly, but the
cities’ defenses have held so far. Surcross has a force field projected by its
five defense towers, and Veil has the Veil of Shadow that gives it its
name. This is the main cause of the current protracted siege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-prison-of-night&quot;&gt;The Prison of Night&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kolthurnal’s prison is a large empty chamber where prisoners are held in place
by levitation magic near the center of the space. They’re stuck in place because
they’re too far away from the walls to push off, and the magic is too strong to
let them move by random thrashing. There’s only the one door, and it’s always
guarded, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This room is reserved for those the Shadovar judge might be useful in a future
hostage exchange, which to them means officers or members of “civilized
races”. Lower-ranking orcs, gnolls and undead are instead killed outright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;movement-and-power&quot;&gt;Movement and Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kolthunral can fly at a leisurely ten miles per hour, and the only thing
limiting its maximum altitude is the fact that it’s not sealed against
vacuum. It could easily have flown over the plateau to attack the Thayan
heartland, but it’s actual goal is to stop the Thayans from using Shadowfell
Road. To do that it needs to destroy Veil and/or Surcross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fortress contains doors that are enchanted to become portals to the
Shadowfell when it passes over an area where the boundaries are
weak. Ironically, this means that it hovers over Veil whenever it needs to take
in new supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city’s mythalar power plant is stored in a nondescript tower near its
center. It’s a standard piece of Netherese tech. Destroying it would make the
city drop from the sky. There are actually rules for this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Magical safety measures slow the city’s fall, but its mass is so high they can
only do so much, and only for a short time. This gives occupants (and PCs!) time
to evacuate, but they’re still in for a bad time if they fail to do so. And you
&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; supposed to give them a good chance to get out - the goal would be to
scare them, not force a TPK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the city hits the ground, effects depend on what its initial altitude was
when it started falling. If it was 100 feet or less, everyone inside takes
damage as if they had fallen that distance - the slowed fall speed is
counteracted by all the collapsing buildings. If it was higher, everyone inside
will be automatically squished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like this region presents the PCs with a sticky situation. Kolthunral’s
goals align perfectly with their own, but both factions here are pretty
terrible. The group can side with one to defeat the other, but the victor will
get a significant boost back in Neverwinter. PCs who don’t want either of them
to win will have to defeat them both here in Thay.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Computering Interval: Fast Firefox Video the Hard Way</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/firefox-logo.png&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
   The Firefox logo.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually write about roleplaying games around here, but I just spend quite a
bit of time chasing down a weird computer issue and I want to write about it
somewhere to record the steps I took.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a big Linux nerd, feel free to skip this. If you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; and have
issues with how I did things, feel free to skip this as well. If you want to
read this anyway, I try to explain some of the basic concepts behind this
quixotic adventure in footnotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happened&quot;&gt;What Happened&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I run Ubuntu on my home desktop, and I currently updated to the latest release
version, 23.10. It was a small upgrade, as I was already running
23.04. Everything worked fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Yi5LFtNTGrs?si=CaEw_fKJMYLh7191&amp;amp;t=256&quot;&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; with some news about version 545 of the nVidia drivers
being released. I was using 535, which again worked fine, but I heard that
545.29.02 fixed a lot of bugs and added some improvements I had been waiting
for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These weren’t part of the official Ubuntu distribution yet, so I added the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa&quot;&gt;Graphics Drivers PPA&lt;/a&gt; to my system, which did have them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I installed the new drivers, tweaked my Firefox config to use Wayland&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and
tested the new setup with a Youtube video. I saw that the videos there remained
weirdly laggy, so I went back to X11 but decided to keep the new driver around
for its other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked quite well for games and everyday usage… but I noticed that my
Youtube videos were still weirdly laggy on X11, and that my computer was
getting quite a bit hotter while playing them than it used to. The “Stats for
Nerds” menu told me they were dropping more or less 50% of their frames, which
is &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little investigation showed me that the Firefox browser did not in fact play
very well with that new graphics driver, at least not in the Snap version that
was installed by default on Ubuntu Linux&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It didn’t really “see” my video
card and so was sending all of its graphical work to the processor instead. It
already did this with videos, but now it was doing this for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest solution to this problem &lt;em&gt;by far&lt;/em&gt;, would have been to go back to
version 535 of my graphics driver, the one I had before that worked just fine. I
could wait for this stuff to get fixed upstream without worrying about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-i-did-instead&quot;&gt;What I Did Instead&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went spelunking into the depths of DuckDuckGo, looking for a way to enable
hardware-based graphical acceleration on Firefox. That would make it use my
video card both for displaying web pages and for playing video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firefox has been able to do this for a while now, but the option was only
enabled by default on Windows or in Linux computers with Intel graphic cards. I
have an Nvidia card with proprietary drivers, so I’m out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firefox uses something called VA-API to talk to the video card when hardware
acceleration is on. On machines like mine the capability is forcibly disabled,
because those drivers don’t support VA-API. It’s possible to bridge the gap, but
the process for that seems to be a bit experimental still. Most people do not
have the time or inclination to worry about that, and are happier for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some trial and error, this was the sequence of events that led me to
success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-one-bridging-the-gap&quot;&gt;Step One: Bridging the Gap&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A developer with the horrible user name of El Farto has &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/elFarto/nvidia-vaapi-driver&quot;&gt;a Github repository&lt;/a&gt;
that contains the code for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nvidia-vaapi-driver&lt;/code&gt; a little wrapper program that
translates VA-API calls into something the Nvidia drivers understand and
vice-versa. The package is actually part of my default Linux distribution, but
since I’m on the 545 drivers I needed a more recent version straight from the
source. That’s v0.0.11, which has support for those drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the excellent documentation in that repository, I did the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Compiled &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nvidia-vaapi-driver&lt;/code&gt; v0.0.11 from source and installed it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Edited &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/default/grub&lt;/code&gt; and changed the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT&lt;/code&gt;
variable to the follwing:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;quiet splash nvidia_drm.modeset=1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edited &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/environment&lt;/code&gt; and added the following environment variables to it:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;nvidia
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;MOZ_DISABLE_RDD_SANDBOX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;NVD_BACKEND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;direct
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I rebooted my computer, and found out the Snap version of Firefox didn’t
detect my video card. Whoops!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was therefore to get rid of Snap Firefox in favor of the
traditionally-packaged version. Give up? Never!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-two-fox-replacement-surgery&quot;&gt;Step Two: Fox Replacement Surgery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I added the repository with the “traditional” packages for Firefox:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I added a file named &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/apt/preferences.d/mozilla-firefox&lt;/code&gt; with the
following contents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Package: firefox&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
Pin: release &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;LP-PPA-mozillateam
Pin-Priority: 1001

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ensures that the PPA’s version is chosen over the Snap. The next step is to
remove the Snap and install the traditional package:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;snap remove firefox

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt remove firefox

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;o=LP-PPA-mozillateam&apos;&lt;/span&gt; firefox
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my user profile is in my home directory this preserved all of my bookmarks
and add-ons. Whew! And Firefox could now see my graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-three-chant-the-deep-magic&quot;&gt;Step Three: Chant the Deep Magic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final step was to change some advanced browser configurations in the dreaded
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;about:config&lt;/code&gt; screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gfx.webrender.all&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; This lets it use the graphics card to
render web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; for video acceleration&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;media.rdd-ffvpx.enabled&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; This disables the built-in-software
codecs in Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gfx.x11-egl.force-enabled&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;widget.dmabuf.force-enabled&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt;
These are needed to get past the “hard blocks” imposed on the browser due to
its default configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These take effect after I restart the browser. Finally, hardware acceleration
works! My computer heads up considerably less than it did, my videos in Firefox
have a buttery-smooth framerate, and I only had to battle a maximum of two Elder
Things to acquire the knowledge of how to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A compositor, the part responsible for drawing windows and whatnot on the
screen of a Linux computer. Wayland is the new hotness in that area, X11 is
the older thing it’s replacing. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Snaps are a form of packaged program that’s a bit more isolated from your
base system than usual. They’re less dependent on the specific traits of
your base system. Snaps are a bit more tricky for developers to configure
right, but they only have to do that once. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>The Great Tabletop Hackathon: Neon City Overdrive</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/nco-cover.png&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;figcaption&gt;
     Neon City Overdrive&apos;s cover.
   &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neon City Overdrive is a game written by Nathan Russel and published by Peril
Planet Game Studio in 2020. This is the smallest core book of all the ones we’ve
seen so far at 72 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also be looking at a supplement named The Grid, which focuses on hacking
and has another 60 pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-overview&quot;&gt;Setting Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of those 132 pages are dedicated to the setting and to a set of adventure
seeds, both of which are largely based on &lt;em&gt;vibes&lt;/em&gt; instead of relying on
laboriously crafted timelines or detailed maps. This is the game of stylish
cyberpunks running dangerous jobs in a neon-lit sprawl. The reader is expected
to take it from there to add details as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting as provided is just a basic sketch. The game takes place in The
City, which is divided into dense residential and commercial zones called
Metroplexes, equally dense hellish industrial blocks named Grinders, and the
Streets that flow in between. The City and the world it’s in are covered by the
Grid, a global computer network where nearly every device that can be described
as “electronic” or “computerized” has a presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Grid gets a somewhat more detailed description because I’m using material
from the supplement here. Like the physical world it has several components. The
Signal lets all those devices connect to the Grid. It’s maintained by an army of
antennas, and repeater drones. The devices attuned to the Signal generate The
Overlay, which is projected into the physical world as a combination of
holograms and augmented reality. Most devices have an augmented reality
interface instead of physical controls, and most signage exists in the Overlay
only. Hubs are big static computers. Some of them help route and maintain the
Signal and the Overlay, or host public virtual environments, but others are
private servers used by the sort of organization your cyberpunks need to hack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the grid through an interface that resembles a real-world smartphone
or desktop browser, but it’s also possible to go into full immersion VR. This
works as you’d expect if you’re familiar with the genre (and if you’ve read the
other entries in this series, you are). We have our Gibsonian matrix here, with
wireframe or low-poly graphics by default, but with specific hubs represented as
more realistic environments. The more powerful the owner, the more realistic
their hubs’ presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of social events happen entirely in the Grid’s virtual reality, from
important business conferences to sport tournaments and nightclub
gatherings. Virtual reality ensures they feel mostly like physical events. That
sure would have been handy during our real world pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that “common” grid users are constantly monitored and
tracked. Player characters and other dirty criminals have their ways of evading
this, and despite the efforts of law enforcement agencies and corporate
security, grid crime is very common and not going away any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you go into VR, you emerge at the Local Area Zone corresponding to your
physical location but can move to any other LAZ you can access with a
thought. Movement within a LAZ is restricted to the sort of thing a real person
would be able to do in the physical world, and the landscape reflects this. Want
to go to a site in your LAZ? You need to walk. The book recognizes this is
inconvenient. Some area zones are private, either disconnected from the public
Grid entirely or separated from it by virtual gates that admit only those with
the proper credentials. A skilled enough hacker might be able to break through a
gate. Totally isolated networks can only be accessed by physically jacking into
their hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can access the grid using wearable computers, which are cheap and widely
available. Serious hackers (called &lt;em&gt;codeslingers&lt;/em&gt; here) have an implanted
interface chip that has all the same functions and allows diving into VR as
well. Those who can’t or won’t use implants can make do with a “Grid-box”, a VR
helmet that also covers the mouth and nose. And both can further benefit from a
sensory deprivation chamber if they’re &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This default presentation is subject to change, as GMs are encouraged to tweak
the arrangement to get the right vibe they want. By tweaking the list of
available technologies and how common they are you could get anything from
mainframes-and-telephones with a chrome veneer to a Ghost in the Shell-like
ubiquitous net where everyone has implanted computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mechanics-overview&quot;&gt;Mechanics Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I understand the rules of Neon City Overdrive belong to the lineage of
Forged in the Dark games. There are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; specific mechanics for the Grid here,
not even if you use the supplement. Hacking uses the exact same mechanics as
everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests use six-sided dice. You start with one Action Die, and gain more for each
factor in your character sheet or the story that helps you succeed, and a Danger
Die for each factor that gets in the way. Then you roll the resulting pool. Each
Danger Die cancels an Action Die that rolled the same value. You take the
highest value rolled in the remaining Action Dice, and use it to determine the
result. A 3 or less is a failure, a 4 or 5 is a partial success with a cost
attached, and a 6 is a complete success. The book goes into a bit more detail
than this, but we don’t need it for this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Narration and the fiction it creates are &lt;em&gt;supremely&lt;/em&gt; important because they’ll
set the stakes for the roll and inform you of which positive and negative
factors are in play to build your die pool. Players are the only ones who roll
dice. Enemies and obstacles are a source of Danger Dice but the GM never needs
to roll for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking also uses those rules. The additional rules material in the Grid
supplement is just a clarification that purely physical traits and tags don’t
apply to tests made in the Grid, and Grid-specific ones don’t apply to the meat
world. Can´t use your muscle grafts to hack the Gibson, can’t use your fancy
programs to lift a car. Mental traits might apply to either “reality”, though.
The book encourages focusing on the imagery of the simulation and making it as
close to the physical world as possible, to make it easier for the group to
describe actions without needing to know a lot about computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-parameters&quot;&gt;Run Parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re supposed to set the exact shape of our Grid when we play, so let’s say
it’s more or less the same as Shadowrun 4th Edition’s. It’s not a pure mesh
network, there’s cell tower hubs and such, but it’s close enough for our
purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hacker will be going along with the physical team. The target office’s Grid
layout is the same as in the SR4 version. The physical location surely has its
own set of tags but the one that affects us is that our good disguises give us
the &lt;em&gt;element of surprise&lt;/em&gt;. Losing this might be one of the consequences for a
hacking complication here. In a real game that’d affect the rest of the team
too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;target-systems&quot;&gt;Target Systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have an office intranet that’s connected to the general Grid through a
firewall, which we bypass by being inside the office. Its security from the
inside is &lt;em&gt;nothing special&lt;/em&gt; except that access to the bank accounts is
&lt;em&gt;well-guarded&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internal security wireless network covers the office but not connected to
the outside. It’s &lt;em&gt;hardened against intrusion&lt;/em&gt; and has a piece of Blue ICE
that will trigger at the first complication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our secret server in the records room with no wireless network at all. Our
hacker must physically jack into it. It’s also &lt;em&gt;hardened&lt;/em&gt;, and has Black ICE
constantly watching over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-hacker&quot;&gt;Our Hacker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pixie-non-binary-human&quot;&gt;Pixie (non-binary human)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trademarks and Edges&lt;/strong&gt;: Metroplexer, Codeslinger (Hacking, Cyber Combat),
Infiltrator (Alarms, Locks)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flaws&lt;/strong&gt;: Greedy, Socially Awkward&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gear&lt;/strong&gt;: Interface Chip (Fast, Advanced), Icebreaker (Silent, Deadly), Stealth
Program Suite (Mimetic, Subtle), something else non-hacking related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixie is kinda min-maxed to fit our scenario, to be honest, with lots of traits
that would apply to hacking. They’re a passable sneak in the physical world but
not very good at physical combat and bad at social interaction. That’s what the
rest of the team is for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-summary&quot;&gt;Run Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team gets into the office as usual - we always assume this part works
out. Pixie hides in the bathroom to find the security network and hack into it
via VR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decide to roll the security server hack as an extended task, since those
require three successes and we have three goals in here. Pixie decides to use
Infiltrator instead of Codeslinger for this, since it is an infiltration of
sorts and that’s where they put put their Alarms and Locks edges. I’m being
lenient towards my player (who is also me) here. Those traits plus all other
relevant tags give Pixie a total of seven action dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pixie is opposed by a single danger die, from the server being Hardened, but
that die rolls a six and eats the one I rolled on the action dice. They’re left
with a 5 and a 4, which count as successes towards our goal but apply
consequences as well. So I rule we lost our Element of Surprise and that the
Blue ICE on the server activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rule that the ICE hasn’t found Pixie yet, but it does get to add its relevant
tags as danger dice on the next roll as it looks for them. Fortunately none of
those roll a six and the action dice do, allowing Pixie to unlock the final door
ahead of time. Tests from this point on are made using Codeslinger as expected,
since they deal purely with stuff that lives in the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get to the secret server and I rule that the Black Ice in there is already
active but will only spot Pixie as a consequence - they start out stealthy. The
ICE however does get to add its Counter-Intrusion and Scary tags as danger dice
even so. Fortunately its rolls are crap and Pixie gets a 6, finding and
downloading the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s go for the money! This means the office network’s Well-Guarded
tag becomes a danger die, but as before the ice only comes online as a
consequence. We roll a 5 here, so it does come online, but not before we
transfer the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical team proceeds to try to leave the office, but as usual we stop our
simulation here since the main hacking bits are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total elapsed time: 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;run-analysis&quot;&gt;Run Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love engaging with crunchy mechanics but narrative systems do have their
advantages! 15 minutes is the fastest time we have so far, beating the “silent
run” from SR 4th Edition by 2 minutes. And this only took so long because I have
absolutely no experience with Neon City Overdrive and had to keep looking at the
books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible this run was too easy, but it’s okay because it’s inserted into
the larger context of the physical break-in. Pixie would have plenty to do in
that part of the run. I might have made a mistake here in simply having
“unaware” ICE add some of its tags to the hacking roll. The system is abstract
enough that I could have ruled slipping past the ICE undetected would require
“fighting” it and filling its Harm boxes while describing it as a sneaking
attempt. Whatever form it took in the narrative, combat would have made things
take longer, but not by much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mechanical bits of the run would probably be much faster than the 50/90
minutes I’ve been assuming here, but this would be offset in all cases by the
extended narration and roleplaying the game demands to frame those mechanics and
establish all the influencing factors for each roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our experiment however does allow us to conclude the obvious: when you use the
exact same simple resolution mechanic for everything, everyone has more or less
the same spotlight time and the classic “Decker problem” won’t manifest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Underwater Dungeon Fantasy 2: Items and Artifacts</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I posted a compilation of methods and tools for &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html&quot;&gt;underwater
adventuring&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, I’ll add a few items and artifacts that further
help with that or that make sense as possessions for underwater people. This is
a grab-bag article without much direction, but I hope it will be useful
nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alchemical-pills&quot;&gt;Alchemical Pills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any drinkable concoction (including magic potions) might be made as a solid pill
instead. Pills tend to be round, thumbnail sized, hard, and meant to be
swallowed whole. Pills are popular with alchemists and herbalists who don’t have
a line to a crystal vial supplier, and with underwater civilizations since
liquid potions don’t really work there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pill costs the same as the equivalent liquid potion. It’s waterproof and not
at risk of breaking from falls and the like, but it also can’t be put into
bandoliers for easy access during combat. Dry-swallowing a pill during a fight
requires either two Ready maneuvers or a single maneuver and a HT roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; put each of your pills into a separately-purchased crystal vial (DF1
p. 111) in order to have them in your potion belt, but that does add an extra
Ready maneuver to the process of ingesting it since you have to open the vial
first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;elixir-of-water-breathing&quot;&gt;Elixir of Water Breathing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This alchemical elixir can be found on GURPS Magic, and is “reprinted” here with
additional options. It’s a drinkable potion that lets you breathe underwater as
if you had Gills for 1d hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GM rolls the die in secret when you drink it, and you remain unaware of how
long you have… until 5 minutes before that time expires, when you get an
instinctive mental warning that you only have 5 minutes left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GMs who dislike the randomness can set a fixed duration based on how much they
want their PCs to spend on these potions. I suggest from 1 to 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Purely aquatic people can instead get Elixirs of &lt;em&gt;Air&lt;/em&gt; Breathing for the same
price and with the equivalent effect for air. Both variants are very likely to
be found in pill form (see above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all cases, the potion is $600, 0.25kg (0.5 lbs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coral-items-4-cf&quot;&gt;Coral Items (+4 CF)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coral is a new implausible material: items made from it have a somewhat porous
texture but are covered in intricate natural patterns of bright colors. Coral
comes in rough or polished varieties, though both cost the same. Surfacers value
it because it’s pretty, underwater civilizations value it for its incidental
properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coral items can be made without fire, though they do require special magic and
techniques known to underwater armorers. They also have neutral buoyancy: their
weight does not count towards Encumbrance when determining the user’s penalty to
Swimming. Anything that’s usually made of metal or wood can be made of coral
instead. Being made of coral adds +4 CF to the item’s total cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;artifact-atlantean-armbands&quot;&gt;Artifact: Atlantean Armbands&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Origin: Divine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pair of gilded orichalcum armbands decorated with reliefs of sharks
and other marine creatures. The Atlantean Armbands were said to be a gift of the
gods to a human hero destined to become the queen of a great underwater
nation. That did indeed happen, and since all of the queen’s descendants were
born with the ability to live underwater the armbands became honored museum
pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That ancient empire has long since fallen to the tides of history, so who knows
where these artifacts might surface next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell Price&lt;/strong&gt;: $50.000.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight&lt;/strong&gt;: 0.5kg (1 lb) for the pair.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Item Capacity&lt;/strong&gt;: 20 FP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;properties&quot;&gt;Properties&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When worn (one in each arm), they allow the wielder to freely breathe and move
underwater as if they had the Gills and Amphibious traits.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If used as power items, any FP from the armbands that’s spent on the Swim and
Breathe Water spells is worth double the energy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;variations&quot;&gt;Variations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some legends tell of another pair of armbands, of silver-plated orichalcum and
decorated with land-animal motifs, that would allow an aquatic wearer to breathe
air and walk on land, assuming a humanoid form if necessary. These were created
by an evil but powerful witch for a mermaid that wanted to walk among humans,
and are Druidic in origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of armbands, you could have rings, piercings, or amulets with the same
enchantments.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read Neverwinter: Thay</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Shadowfell Road ends in Thay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the book technically breaks its promises. While every other place
so far has been presented as somewhere the party could go, the text here sounds
almost scared when it talks about the Thayan heartland because that’s where
Szass Tam and all his epic-level wizard buddies live. It makes it very clear
that the PCs should not go there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the bulk of this section is not actually talking about the massive
plateau that makes up the Thayan heartland, but about the peripheral areas
surrounding that plateau. Special attention is given to Surcross and Veil, a
pair of fortified towns at its base, as well as to the Netherese flying fortress
that’s currently besieging them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Veil is where the Shadowfell Road ends. Surcross is a short distance away and is
where all of Valindra’s supplies come from. The main reason the PCs would want
to come here is to disrupt that supply network in order to defeat her back in
Neverwinter. Depending on how the GM sets things up, it’s also possible her soul
vessel is hidden somewhere in Surcross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area around these two cities is a horrifying wasteland of destroyed nature
and abandoned villages whose ground is coated in bits of bone and flesh that
were too broken up to animate. We’ll take a look at the general area here, and
then zoom into the cities and fortress in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview-of-thay&quot;&gt;Overview of Thay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In editions past, Thay used to be a slave-holding nation of evil wizards whose
schtick was over-specializing in one of D&amp;amp;D’s schools of magic. Their ideology
was very similar to fascism with wizards at the top of the heap, but they tried
to present a more “friendly” face to the outside world, setting up trade
enclaves while keeping their dastardly schemes secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the lich Szass Tam used to be a member of Thay’s ruling council, but
now he’s taken over completely and became its supreme leader. He turned Thay
into a “nation of undeath”, equally devoted to necromancy and conquest. Why
pretend to be friendly to other nations when you can just invade them and take
their stuff? The only deity whose worship Tam permits is Bane, the evil god of
conquest, and he’s suspicious of even that. Yes, worship of Vecna is completely
forbidden - I think Tam sees him as the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thay remains in this state when we switch to 5th Edition, by the way - it’s one
of the things they didn’t change back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climbing to the top of the Thayan plateau is discouraged not only by the book’s
scared tone, but by the many defenses placed around it. Its walls are almost
vertical and the only ways up are a set of narrow switchbacks that leave
characters exposed to artillery fire from both sides of the ongoing war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Surcross and the Netherese fortress of Kolthunral have amazingly powerful
weapons and defenses at their disposal. Kolthunral’s mission is to cut
Valindra’s supply line by destroying Surcross and/or Veil, which is why it
hasn’t moved away. The PCs arrive to find them locked in a prolonged siege, as
neither is able to fully overcome the others’ defenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A significant portion of Thay’s forces are composed of undead, both at the grunt
and officer levels. Their living soldiers are mostly humans, orcs, and gnolls,
with plenty of spellcasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A character like the Renegade Red Wizard could be very helpful here if they
still have friends in the region, but they’re also coming back to the lion’s den
and if the Thayans realize the renegade is here they will be relentless in their
pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to any friends of the Red Wizard PC that might be here, the area
also contains a bunch of spies and infiltrators sent by Dempharis Sibront, an
elderly Red Wizard who escaped Tam’s conquest of the nation. Sibront considers
himself nobility in exile and his network of infiltrated rebels is looking for
any way to weaken’s Tam’s hold on the country. The PCs can form an alliance of
convenience with him to fulfill their own goals, since they align, and his
forces will be genuinely helpful in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However he is likely to interpret this situation as the PCs agreeing to serve
him indefinitely, and could become an enemy in future adventures when he
realizes that wasn’t the case. That seems like an interesting opportunity for
continuing the campaign past the material in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-charnel-fields&quot;&gt;The Charnel Fields&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The horrifying plains of death in the area surrounding the two Thayan towns are
a product not just of the war, but also of Thayan fuckery. Since right after the
first battles, the Thayans started hauling corpses from the battlefield for
animation. But since some of those battles happened far away, they decided to
enact a “little” ritual to make things more convenient, using the blood of the
fallen as a focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any corpse left on or under the earth within a hundred miles of Surcross will be
sucked by the enchanted soil and transported to an area near the city, where it
will be extruded to the surface. This makes it easy for Thayan necromancers to
haul them back for reanimation, and it also attracts all sorts of natural and
supernatural predators who want to feast on the remaining bits. The Netherese
have also started hauling corpses away from the charnel fields, to deny the “raw
material” to their enemies and maybe animate some of it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relsforin&quot;&gt;Relsforin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desperate inhabitants of this small village survived by making themselves
useful to Thay. They make up the bulk of the labor force that hauls corpses from
the Charnel Fields to Surcross, and in exchange receive some protection from
Netherese attacks. They fear the Netherese more than they resent the Thayans,
and if they think a group of strangers (such as the PCs) are likely to be
enemies of their masters, they will turn them in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;echo-village&quot;&gt;Echo Village&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This village belonged to the neighboring nation of Thesk until a short while
ago. The mercantile Theskans built it as a trade post near the Thayan border, to
facilitate commerce with the wizard nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the war started the Thayans invaded the village and slaughtered
all of its inhabitants to turn them into more undead soldiers. They left the
village behind as an empty husk, but the angry ghosts of the inhabitants soon
appeared to haunt the place and wail about the hatred they felt for their
murderers. This attracted the spirits of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; Thayan victims, turning Echo
Village into a sort of gathering point for ghosts with a grudge against Thay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ghosts’ default reaction to any living people approaching their village is
violence - they’ll attack while shouting rants against Thay. PC groups who are
perceptive and diplomatic enough might be able to figure things out from these
rants and convince the ghosts that they too are enemies of Thay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would ironically make Echo Village the safest refuge for the PCs in the
entire region, as the ghosts would allow them to stay while still attacking any
intruders. It’s an interesting contrast with Relsforin, which &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; safe but
is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs then manage to lure the Thayan legion that contains the villagers’
original bodies back to Echo, the ghosts will be able to “repossess” their
bodies and turn against their commanders, potentially slaughtering the whole
legion. This will finally let them rest, and they will inform the PCs of any
sensitive information their bodies learned before moving on from the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yikes! War crimes as far as the eye can see. It does put the events happening in
Neverwinter into context. GMs and players might be used to thinking of
heroic-tier campaigns as being “no big deal” in the grand scheme of things, but
everything that’s happening here in Thay is a B plot for the events in
Neverwinter.&lt;/p&gt;
