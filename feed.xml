        <title>Let's Read the Neverwinter Campaign Setting: Netherese</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned several times in this Let’s Read already, Netheril was a human
empire who ruled over most of the world around three thousand years before our
narrative present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their understanding of magic reached levels never seen before or since, but they
fell literally overnight when one of their top archmages tried to cast a spell
that was supposed to make him into a god but instead irreversibly fucked up
Toril’s magic. This caused the vast majority of the flying islands where these
archmages lived to plummet to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One such island managed to avoid this fate when its inhabitants plane-shifted it
into the Shadowfell (known as the Plane of Shadow back then). They stayed there
until the end of Second Edition, when they started coming back into the world,
mutated by their millenia in darkness and with a desire to rebuild their former
empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These shadow-people are known as Shadovar, but they also consider themselves to
be Netherese and the book uses the two terms interchangeably. There’s a group of
them hiding in the Neverwinter Wood, led by a mage named Clariburnus Tanthul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shadovar have a single major goal in this region: to repair the fallen
island of Xinlenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xinlenal was the first Netherese flying island ever built, the crowning
achievement of the ancient archmage Iolaum, who discovered the technique to
making them. Making it fly again would raise the flag of Netherese dominance
over the whole region, and it would become their greatest center of power in the
entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to fixing Xinlenal is to repair its &lt;em&gt;mythallar&lt;/em&gt;, a magical engine that
looks like a giant crystal sphere and shines like a contained sun. It shattered
when the city fell, and Shadovar artificers are hard at work repairing it as the
campaign starts. The process requires immense quantities of Residuum, and the
easiest way to produce Residuum is to destroy magic items. The older and more
powerful, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means Shadovar agents are scouring the entire region looking for ancient
ruins and the magical relics they contain. The ruined cities of Illefarn, the
crumbling outposts of Delzoun, even the burial mounds of Uthgardt heroes: all of
these are fair game, and anyone who would object to their plundering is an
enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even these ancient ruins might yield enough residuum for their purposes,
though. They’ve started looking at less-old places too. As the campaign starts
that’s still mostly consists of clashing with and looting the bodies of Thayan
and Ashmadai goons, but they could soon move up to plundering Neverwinter
itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Caliburnus’ secondary goals include discovering the fate of Iolaum. Sure,
the wizard lived thousands of years ago and was on Xinlenal when it fell, but
surely one of the bestest mages from the bestest magical empire ever wouldn’t
let little details like that kill him, would it? Imagine what he could do for
the Shadovar cause if he’s brought on-board!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other secondary goal is to pursue their war with Thay. There’s only room for
&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; world-spanning fascist mage empire in this planet, after all. The Shadovar
regularly attack the Thayan base in the Dread Ring, and they’ve also managed to
park one of their flying fortresses above the Thayan city of Surcross, which
they bombard regularly. In case you don’t remember, that’s one of the possible
locations where Valindra might have hidden her soul vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, further down the list, there’s the handling of the Gray Wolf
Uthgardt tribe. The Shadovar recruited them into their service with appeals to
their “ancient Netherese heritage” and gave them the mission to infiltrate and
eventually conquer Helm’s Hold. So far the werewolves have managed to place
several agents in the town, who are busy sowing unrest and generally making it
ready for a takeover. Their progress is slow but in Caliburnus’ view the tribe’s
main purpose is to act as a red herring when people start trying to investigate
Netherese activities. In the meantime, Gray Wolf warriors also get used as
muscle when the need for it arises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;player-tie-ins&quot;&gt;Player Tie-Ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherese seems to be the major faction with the most explicit tie-ins to PC
backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scion of Shadow, of course, starts the game in direct conflict with
them. They have enough information to begin opposing the faction right away, and
especially bold Scions might think to pretend to be loyal in order to infiltrate
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their rampant plundering of ancient ruins also places them in direct opposition
to the Iliyanbruen Guardian, Heir of Delzoun, and the Uthgardt Barbarian. The
book says they are definitely guilty of stealing those eladrin relics, but it’s
less definitive about their role in plundering the Uthgardt barrow - that could
have been the Thayans depending on what the GM desires. Even so, their control
of the Gray Wolves will still make them cross paths with both the Barbarian and
the Pack Outcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Netherese don’t care about &lt;strong&gt;New Neverwinter&lt;/strong&gt; at all, though that will
change a bit when they start targeting the city for its magic items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are completely ignorant of the &lt;strong&gt;Abolethic Sovereignity&lt;/strong&gt;. Some of their
officials suspect there’s something funky going on beneath Neverwinter and have
sent agents to investigate, but they’re only going to bother Caliburnus about
this when those agents return with answers. This makes the fact that they’re
trying to conquer Helm’s Hold particularly funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They see the &lt;strong&gt;Ashmadai&lt;/strong&gt; as nothing more than minions of the Thayans and have
no idea the cult has plans of its own. The &lt;strong&gt;Thayans&lt;/strong&gt; of course are their
greatest enemies in the region and the Shadovar devote as many resources to
fighting them as they do to restoring Xinlenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have some important links to minor factions, as mentioned above. Their
hold over the Gray Wolves means they will have to deal with the other &lt;strong&gt;Uthgardt
Tribes&lt;/strong&gt; eventually, and the &lt;strong&gt;fey of Iliyanbruen&lt;/strong&gt; are the primary targets of
their relic raids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Netherese are a bit less cognizant of the other factions than I
expected, their plans are appropriately ambitious and they have a real shot at
success barring PC intervention. They also have a bunch of strong ties to
several PC themes, so they’re very likely to feature in your campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Play Hell's Rebels: Devils and other Fiends</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My recent adaptation efforts for that Hell’s Rebels campaign had me going on a
spelunking expedition about fiend stats in D&amp;amp;D. Here’s what I found out, and
what I intend to do about it on this GURPS adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes here, “fiend” refers to all of the monsters that originate from
the “evil planes” of the D&amp;amp;D universe: demons, devils, daemons, and
others. “Fiend” was the only general term left, so we’re using it in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fiends-in-dd&quot;&gt;Fiends in D&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D&amp;amp;D’s fiend situation is one of the most egregious examples of its tendency
towards overly-complicated taxonomies&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Every synonym becomes the name of a
distinct type of monster with stats that differ from those of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real purpose of the divide here seems to be mechanical: in most editions
each type has a different lengthy list of weaknesses and resistances that seems
calculated to confuse players. Things that are good against devils are bad
against demons and vice-versa - if the PCs guess wrong, they’re in trouble. The
specifics here change from edition to edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lore-wise, early editions made a big deal out of the fact that devils were
Lawful Evil and demons Chaotic Evil. Later ones tried to elaborate on it and
find more ways to explain that the two alignments were different at a
fundamental cosmic level. Pathfinder really doubles down on that, trying to find
additional themes for every fiend type it presents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pathfinder 1e, which is what we’re interested in, has this configuration for the
mechanical bits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Demons are immune to lightning; Devils take normal damage from it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Devils are immune to fire; Most demons are merely resistant to it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re equally resistant to acid and cold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re both immune to poison.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They’re resistant to weapon attacks unless the weapon is Good-aligned &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;
made from a special material. For demons, that’s cold iron; for devils,
silver. Powerful specimens have resistance that can only be bypassed by
weapons fulfilling both the alignment and material requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about as complex to describe as it was in previous editions, but it’s
actually much easier to completely bypass due to the combinatorial explosion in
spells and magical effects available to players compared to AD&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first couple of levels you can forget about the materials requirement
entirely, because you’ll have access to Align Weapon or the Holy enchantment. By
the time you’re fighting those stronger fiends, you’ll probably have a +3 weapon
in hand, which also bypasses both material requirements. And as for elemental
damage types, this is the edition that introduces sonic damage, which damages
both demons and devils normally. It also makes it quite easy for a character to
swap all of their spells’ damage to sonic&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fiends-in-dungeon-fantasy&quot;&gt;Fiends In Dungeon Fantasy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dungeon Fantasy is a lot simpler. Demon is one of the big monster categories in
the game, and all demons come from the area colloquially known as Hell. The
specifics are left as an exercise to the GM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belonging to the Demon category makes them immune to magic that affects the
minds of natural creatures and susceptible to magic that affects spirits in
general or demons in particular. They don’t count as “alive” for spells that
strictly require living targets but always count as “evil” for spells and
abilities that affect evil creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most notably, they do not have any universal resistances to elemental damage or
mundane weapons. Each demon “species”, other than the very weakest ones, does
have additional defenses. Most take damage as normal but can only &lt;em&gt;die&lt;/em&gt; if a
specific condition is met. They also often lack some or all of the weak points
of natural creatures, such as blood and vital organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaming Ballistic’s &lt;em&gt;Nordlond Bestiary&lt;/em&gt; does include some demons that are direct
adaptations of D&amp;amp;D fiends, but only the most powerful of them (the Balor and Pit
Fiend equivalents) have resistances that resemble Pathfinder’s to any degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-will-i-do-in-hells-rebels&quot;&gt;What Will I Do in Hell’s Rebels?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was starting this project way back in 2017, I’d probably be gearing up to
convert every devil that appeared in Hell’s Rebels to GURPS. But since this is
2023, I don’t have to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of first- and third-party Dungeon Fantasy books now, and between
them I have more than enough stat blocks available that I can just pick whatever
looks closer to the original monster and use that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does mean that I’m going to end up ignoring a lot of the default D&amp;amp;D
cosmology and lore when picking my monsters. “Demon” and “devil” are once again
synonyms - there is no fundamental cosmic difference between them. They all come
from the same place. Any differences, if they ever become relevant, are
political rather than taxonomical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also ignoring the difference between Lawful Evil and Chaotic Evil because
1) there is no alignment in GURPS DF and 2) it’s a bit nonsensical anyway. In
fact, &lt;em&gt;Pathfinder itself&lt;/em&gt; is going to get rid of alignment in its upcoming
revised second edition, which was motivated by an attempt to rid itself of all
remaining ties to the OGL after this January’s brouhaha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game’s existing rules should suffice to determine whether something counts
as “holy”/”good” or “unholy”/”evil” for game purposes. This is a similar
approach to what I hear PF 2.5 is going to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Another famous one is incorporeal undead. Is that thing a wraith, a
specter, a shade, or a ghost? &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That’s assuming they want to fight fair in the first place instead of
casting one of this edition’s many instant fight-enders. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Thayan Encounters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The encounter table includes a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of undead, and some spellcasters like the
Human Transmuter from the MV to act as living Red Wizards. Valindra’s special
projects also get some consideration here, and then we move on to the lich
herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-neverwinter-nine&quot;&gt;The Neverwinter Nine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the renowned bodyguards of Lord Nasher Alagondar a century ago. After
their deaths, they were buried in the castle crypts in honor of their exemplary
service. Should Valindra manage to animate them as undead, they’d have the stats
of a Deathlock Wight from the MV or the stats for a Unhallowed Wight presented
in this book (level 7 soldier, 80 hp, claws that immobilize and drain healing
surges, auto-damage as an opportunity action on enemies who pass a saving
throw). You can also use similar undead monstrosities if you want to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the Neverwinter Nine get two extra powers in addition to whatever
their base stat block gives them. &lt;strong&gt;One in Nine&lt;/strong&gt; is an encounter power that
lets the creature teleport and swap places with another of the Nine that’s
within 20 squares. And &lt;strong&gt;Change Shape&lt;/strong&gt; lets them take the form of a Medium
humanoid they killed during the last encounter, lasting until they use the power
again or cancel the transformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last one means the Nine can serve story roles as infiltrators. One might
even manage to replace Lord Neverember or another big shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ash-zombie&quot;&gt;Ash Zombie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are zombies produced by the particular conditions of the eruption disaster
area. They leave a trail of ash in their wake and are drawn to “fresh” life, the
younger the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any corporeal undead can be converted into the “Ash” equivalent with the
addition of the &lt;strong&gt;Puff of Ash&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power. When the creature is first
bloodied, this triggers and enemy Fortitude in a Close Burst 2. A hit makes the
target grant combat advantage and prevents them from spending healing surges
(save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lorragauth&quot;&gt;Lorragauth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lorragauth was a particularly despicable elder black dragon who died in the
process of destroying his own domain, which he started doing because he realized
he was dying. If he couldn’t have it, then no one else could!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Valindra succeeds at reanimating him, he’s going to use the stats for a
dracolich from the Monster Vault or the Forgotten Realms Campaign
Setting. Either is going to make him a Level 12 Solo Controller and one the most
powerful monsters in the entire campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;valinda-shadowmantle&quot;&gt;Valinda Shadowmantle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valindra is much like a typical lich in that she’s extremely arrogant,
egotistical and ambitious. She serves Tam because it suits her for now and is a
very competent lieutenant, but her arrogance makes her prone to underestimating
her opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has complete confidence that her soul vessel is securely hidden and will
never be found by any of her enemies, so she doesn’t fear destruction and fights
with seemingly suicidal zeal to protect her plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How right she is depends on how the GM wishes to play her. If they want the PCs
to defeat her after a single climatic battle, the vessel is right there in her
inner sanctum at the Dread Ring. If they want to make her a recurring threat,
it’s hidden in the far away Thayan city of Scorrus (which is covered later in
the book).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Velindra’s stats shows us she was an eladrin in life, probably a sun elf. She’s
a Level 9 Elite Controller with 188 HP. She has a ground speed of 6, a flight
speed of 4, and darkvision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her basic melee attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Vampiric Touch&lt;/strong&gt; that deals necrotic damage and
heals Valindra for the same amount. This will be quite annoying to PCs and
greatly increase her staying power. Her basic ranged attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Phantom
Claw&lt;/strong&gt; that targets one or two creatures, deals necrotic and psychic damage, and
immobilizes (save ends). Each failed saving throw lets her slide the target 2
squares. On a miss, the target is still slowed (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has a &lt;strong&gt;Profane Fire&lt;/strong&gt; attack that’s pretty much a fireball that does
necrotic and fire damage, and recharges when she’s bloodied. And she retains the
&lt;strong&gt;Fey Step&lt;/strong&gt; she had in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As minor actions, she can use one of two encounter powers. &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Cloak&lt;/strong&gt;
gives her insubstantial and phasing but prevents her from taking standard
actions until she ends the whole effect as a free action. And &lt;strong&gt;Reanimate&lt;/strong&gt; lets
her bring a dead non-minion ally back into the fight as an undead creature. The
creature comes back with HP equal half its bloodied value and gains Resist
Necrotic 10 and Vulnerable Radiant 5. The target must have been a living
creature before dying - if it was undead already, this doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which of these is the Thayan’s most fearsome weapon depends on how you want to
play them. If they’re an insidious and secretive threat in your campaign, then
you’ll get a lot of mileage out of the Neverwinter Nine and their ability to
replace key people in other organizations. If they’re a more direct and forceful
enemy, facing Lorragauth is a distinct possibility in the PCs’ futures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, Valindra herself is a key player and should likely be there for the
final fight. PCs might end up facing her a few times before then, depending on
how secure you want her soul vessel to be. Finding it could be a neat series of
adventures in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: The Red Wizards of Thay</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When Szass Tam the epic lich took over the nation of Thay, he tasked the Red
Wizards with building a series of fortresses over powerful sources of
necromantic magic all through the Realms. These fortresses would siphon and
channel magic energy to him, helping him power a major ritual that would turn
him into a god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dread Ring was the fortress built into the Neverwinter Wood. The Thayans’
plan here was to wake up the slumbering primordial Maegera, which would level
Neverwinter completely and kill every one of its inhabitants. The power derived
from these deaths would then be sent to Tam. The wizards were foiled at the last
minute, yet Maegera still woke up a little and caused the eruption which
&lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; destroyed Neverwinter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Thayans are back. There are little more than frightened whispers about
their presence in the region, and no one knows they were responsible for
destroying the city thirty years ago, but if left unchecked there’s a good
chance they’ll finish the job, one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-and-strategies&quot;&gt;Goals and Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thayan presence in the region is focused on the ruins of the Dread Ring,
where living wizards and undead laborers work tirelessly to rebuild the walls of
the fortress and fix its damaged magic circuits. They’re led by a lich named
Valindra Shadowmantle, one of Tam’s lieutenants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her mission is to either restore the Ring to its old purpose, or to find a new
one for it. The first goal is likely impossible - the godhood ritual does not
allow for second chances and all of the other fortresses have proved
unusable. Valindra has a pretty good idea of how she will reach the second goal,
though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She has discovered why this site was a suitable location for the fortress in the
first place! Deep beneath its location is the incredibly ancient tomb of a great
black dragon named Lorragauth. Inside rests the beast’s intact skeleton, which
emits a great deal of necrotic energy. Valindra thinks it’s possible to animate
the skeleton as a dracolich under her control, and she’s “conquered” a local
cell of the Cult of the Dragon to aid her in this endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cult of the Dragon are an old Forgotten Realms standby: yet another bunch of
evil maniacs intent on ruling the world, but also the only group in the setting
who knows how to make dracoliches. Their ritual requires a &lt;em&gt;living&lt;/em&gt; dragon, but
Valindra is confident her pet cult can change it to work on ancient bones. And
if they can’t, she’ll find someone to resurrect the dragon first and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; turn
it into a dracolich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cult, of course, is not happy about this. Its leader, Adimond Kroskas, is
being forced to work for Valindra because she stole his Ring of the Dragon,
which acts as his symbol of authority and is a powerful magical item in its own
right. He can’t call on his own superiors for help because they’ll destroy him
for losing the ring. He’s currently maintaining the loyalty of his underlings
because he’s promised to get the ring back. While he figures out a way to do it,
he and his cult are working to find a way to raise Lorragauth… as slowly as
possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Valindra is still trying to find a way to properly “refuel”
the Dread Ring. One of her theories is that it might be possible to drain power
directly from Maegera to feed into the fortress. That would require finding a
new path to Gauntlgrym (the one they used in the novel has collapsed). If the
Netherese manage to fix Xinlenal, though, she might divert her efforts to
capturing it in order to use its mythalar engine as that power source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third goal they’re working towards is building up an undead army. They’ve
begun a mass grave-robbing operation in Neverwinter’s cemetery to produce
low-level undead to act as laborers and guards, and are sending the surplus back
to Thay to aid in their war with Netheril as well. They’re also established an
outpost in the crypts beneath Castle Never, where they are attempting to raise
an old group of heroes (the Neverwinter Nine) as powerful revenants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;player-tie-ins&quot;&gt;Player Tie-Ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Renegade Red Wizard is our theme that’s on a collision course with the
Thayans, but others might also find themselves involved. People have started to
notice the grave-robbing and might contact someone like Oghma’s Faithful or the
Neverwinter Noble to help them solve this mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uthgardt Barbarian would also be very interested in this as the Thayans are
a very likely suspect in the sacking of their holy burial mound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Oghma’s Faithful might be approached my mysterious but generous
patrons who wish to hire them to perform some important magical research…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, we also get full stats for the stolen &lt;strong&gt;Ring of Dragons&lt;/strong&gt;, which might make
a cool magic item for the PCs if they manage to acquire it. It’s a Level 7 Rare
item. Wearing it gives you the ability to speak, read, and write Draconic, and
to communicate telepathically with dragons in your line of sight. It also has
two active daily powers. One of them makes your location known to every evil
dragon within a day’s travel, which cultists use as a way to summon allies but
is likely to backfire for PCs. The other projects sustainable illusion of a
dragon of up to Gargantuan size within 40 squares of you. It can make sounds and
move, and generally does a convincing job of looking like you summoned an elder
dragon bodyguard. However it will pop like a soap bubble if it touches anything
or is hit by an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Neverwinter has just started to look into Thayan activities in the region,
and the Thayans have begun providing material support to the Sons of Alagondar
to thrown them off the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Valindra knows the Abolethic Sovereignity has an operation in the region, but
that’s all she knows, and it makes her very angry. She’s begun sending people to
investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Thayans and Netherese are at war all over the Realms, and this area is no
exception. A lot of that undead manpower Valindra has been building up is being
used in an ongoing battle against the local Netherese operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also has some conflicts with the Many-Arrows Orcs, who occasionally encroach
upon the Dread Ring and must be driven off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, you’ll notice that I did not mention the Ashmadai even once despite
Valindra living in their head rent-free over in the Ashmadai entry. That’s how
much she thinks of them. They are nothing more than disposable muscle to her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we’ll see from the encounter table in the next post, the Thayans are clearly
set up to be one of the campaign’s final bosses - possibly &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; final boss if
they manage to animate Lorragauth. Valindra is the most powerful faction boss so
far even without the dragon, and their backstory does have a nice thematic link
to the event that started this whole situation in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Ashmadai Encounters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The enemy table for the Ashmadai includes Heroic-tier devils and cambions from
several books, and also several humanoid opponents that could be reskinned as
cultists. We also get a few new stat blocks for cultists and devils, and for the
cult’s leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seared-devil&quot;&gt;Seared Devil&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking like a stinky burned corpse, this devil hurls itself at its victims,
driven by envy of their uncooked state. It’s a Level 3 Soldier with 50 HP, speed
5, and Resist 10 Fire. Its basic attack is an &lt;strong&gt;Ashen Slam&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and
marks for a turn on a hit. Enemies that ignore the mark are hit by the &lt;strong&gt;Choking
Ashes&lt;/strong&gt; power, taking 5 fire damage and getting slowed for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;branded-zealot&quot;&gt;Branded Zealot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who get initiated into the cult are branded with the symbol of
Asmodeus. Most of them use this stat block. The typical zealot has a frightful
temper and is easily goaded into fights. They’re Level 4 Brutes with 66 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zealots attack in melee with a &lt;strong&gt;Branding Iron&lt;/strong&gt; that deals fire damage, and at
range with a Range 3 &lt;strong&gt;Hellfire Chain&lt;/strong&gt; spell that deals fire damage, pulls 2
squares, and slows for a turn on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their special move is named &lt;strong&gt;Bow to Your Master&lt;/strong&gt;, and it lets them do a
Hellfire chain attack followed by a Branding Iron attack if the target is
adjacent to them. It recharges when neither attack hits. If both of them do, the
target falls prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hellfire-warlock&quot;&gt;Hellfire Warlock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more discreet cultist, who got infernal warlock powers from deals with
Asmodeus. They’re better at concealing their brands and like to infiltrate enemy
centers to spy and sabotage them. They’re Level 4 Artillery with 48 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warlock’s &lt;strong&gt;Hellfire Affinity&lt;/strong&gt; gives them +2 to defenses against enemies
who are taking ongoing fire damage. Both of their basic attacks (a &lt;strong&gt;dagger&lt;/strong&gt;
for melee and a &lt;strong&gt;Hellfire&lt;/strong&gt; bolt for ranged combat) damage and inflict ongoing
fire damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter they can release a &lt;strong&gt;Concussive Inferno&lt;/strong&gt; in a Close
Burst 2, targeting enemies. On a hit, this deals fire and force damage, pushes
the targets 2 squares, and knocks them prone. On a miss it still deals half
damage and pushes 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a creature within 10 squares of the warlock is taking fire damage, they can
&lt;strong&gt;Ride the Fire&lt;/strong&gt; as a move action (recharge 5+) and teleport to swap places
with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fimbrul-devil&quot;&gt;Fimbrul Devil&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks just like a seared devil, but is cold. These things hail from Nessus or
Cania, and it is said that someone who survives a fight with them suffers from
persistent chills for years afterwards. They’re Level 5 Controllers with 66 HP,
Speed 6 with Ice Walk, and Resist 10 to both fire and cold damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Icy Claws&lt;/strong&gt; deal cold damage; their &lt;strong&gt;Icy Exhalation&lt;/strong&gt; hits a Close
Blast 3, deals cold damage, and slows for a turn. Targets that were already
slowed are instead immobilized. Once per encounter they can encase a creature in
a &lt;strong&gt;Frozen Prison&lt;/strong&gt; as a ranged attack, which deals cold damage and restrains
(save ends). On a miss, the target takes half damage and is immobilized (save
ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mordai-vell&quot;&gt;Mordai Vell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pleasant face of the cult, Mordai Vell is a tiefling aristocrat descended
from one of Neverwinter’s minor noble clans that was largely unaffected by the
cataclysm. This doesn’t give him a claim to the throne, but does leave him with
a lot of inherited wealth. His money and title make him an influent character in
the city’s politics, and his public reputation is generally good because he’s
almost as charismatic as he thinks he is. He sees Asmodeus not as his master,
but as a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the deals and schemes detailed above, Vell is also dealing with a
duergar named Nimor Ironvoice who claims to have access to a source of
hellthorn, a special metallic alloy that is very easy to enchant with infernal
magic. He has people following Ironvoice around for a while now, but the duergar
is careful enough to avoid revealing his sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When faced in combat, Vell is a Level 6 Lurker with 60 HP and Resist 10
Fire. His basic melee attack is with a &lt;strong&gt;rod&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and pushes 2
squares, but his special powers are the most interesting part about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiery Corona&lt;/strong&gt; attacks a Close Burst 2, dealing fire and force damage and
inflicting ongoing fire damage. &lt;strong&gt;Shrouded in Fire&lt;/strong&gt; deals 5 automatic fire
damage to everyone adjacent to Mordai and lets him become invisible and teleport
5 squares. He remains invisible until he attacks or until the end of his next
turn. Using one of these powers recharges the other, so he’s going to alternate
them if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;favria&quot;&gt;Favria&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favria had been enslaved by a far-away band of Asmodeus-worshiping duergar since
her birth. She escaped their service, but kept their faith. She made her way to
Neverwinter to search for Gauntlgrym, joining up with the local cult and rising
to a leadership position mostly through force and intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Vell is the pleasant lie, Favria is the harsh reality of Asmodeus
worship. Instead of lies and intrigue, she prefers to deal with problems by the
direct application of violence. Still, she sees value in his way of doing
things, and cooperates by keeping herself and her underlings mostly out of
Neverwinter proper. They have a hideout in the ruins of the village of
Thundertree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Vell, Favria knows exactly what the unholy relic of Asmodeus held by the
Thayans is capable of, which is why she is so intent on recovering it. She’s
also still looking for Gauntlgrym. She is unaware that it’s currently occupied
by Asmodeus-worshiping duergar, and her reaction to that discovery is
unpredictable. Will she readily cooperate with her fellows in faith, or will she
try to kill them to avenge her suffering at the hands of a similar group?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favria is a Level 5 Skirmisher with 68 HP. She has Resist 5 to fire and poison,
and fights using a pair of custom &lt;strong&gt;bladed hand crossbows&lt;/strong&gt; that can be used in
melee or at range. The melee attack deals extra damage if the target grants
combat advantage, and the ranged attack fires &lt;strong&gt;poisoned bolts&lt;/strong&gt; that damage and
inflict ongoing poison damage (save ends). &lt;strong&gt;Dual Assault&lt;/strong&gt; lets her make one of
each attack once per encounter, recharging if neither hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did say I wasn’t inclined to make the Ashmadai a major thread but if I still
wanted them to have a bit of staying power I’d probably tone down Mordai Vell’s
personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As written, his demeanor is so Trump-like any players here in 2023 will
immediately figure out he’s a bad guy and do their best to gank him early. That
might bring some attention from the other factions, but would remove the cult
itself as an effective threat.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Ashmadai</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since before the cataclysm that destroyed the city, the Neverwinter region was
being infiltrated by the Ashmadai, a particularly powerful cult of
Asmodeus. There’s a lot of backstory here, which seems to tie into to a Drizz’t
novel. Let’s try to go over it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back before the Cataclysm, the Ashmadai mostly worked as flunkies for the
Thayans, because the Thayan leader Szass Tam had in his possession a scepter
believed to be an unholy relic of Asmodeus. They were the wizards’ muscle when
they tried to destroy Neverwinter to build the Dread Ring, their super
necromantic fortress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that plan fell through in a Drizz’t novel, the Thayans fled the area and
left the Ashmadai to their own devices until recently, when this Thayan lich
named Valindra came back and announced she was the unholy scepter’s new owner,
demanding the cultists’ loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cult now finds itself split into two sub-factions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditionalists are older and less educated, and serve out of genuine faith
in their evil god. They’re okay with going back to being Thayan flunkies because
of the scepter, which they value highly. They’re led by a dwarf named Favria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “new guard” is less religious and a lot more pragmatic. They want to retain
their independence and rule the region themselves. They’re led by a tiefling
named Mordai Vell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those two sub-factions are actually quite friendly with each other. Their
leaders meet regularly, even though their lower-ranking members have no
contact. Favria will happily leave the Thayans’ service if Vell can steal the
scepter from them. Vell also wants to capture Valindra’s soul vessel, which will
let him extract some payback from the lich for all the abuse she has been
heaping upon them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they’ve attained their independence, the Ashmadai plan to move on to
dominating the region. What exactly this means is up to the GM, and will inform
their strategies. Do they want to rule the region openly as its new imperial
masters? Do they want to establish themselves as a “legitimate” religion and
rule that way? Do they want to be a power behind the throne? Do they want to
harness Maegera’s power to do so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, the Ashmadai are by far the weakest of the major factions from this
book, so a lot of their more immediate goals revolve around fixing that and
avoiding the notice of the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pragmatist faction operates mostly from the shadows. Mordai Vell established
a complex system of cells or “pods”, where the highest-ranking leaders report to
him but don’t know each other, and this structure repeats down each leader’s
hierarchy all the way down to the dumb muscle on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditionalist faction is more direct and violent, though they mostly keep
out of town unless called upon. In areas already under their control, they paint
their symbol on buildings and alleys as a way to remind the local populace who’s
boss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the aboleths, the Ashmadai are fond of kidnapping people. Their victims
become sacrifices in a peculiar arrangement they have with their diabolic
patron. For each devil they summon into the world, they must also bind a mortal
to a devil’s spirit. These possessed individuals can look like mortals while
using devil stats, or use their original stats with the addition of a couple of
thematic powers. I guess this devil-summoning must be the Ashmadai’s primary
means of increasing their firepower, but since those possessions are framed as
the &lt;em&gt;price&lt;/em&gt; of the summonings I’m guessing the possessed are not directly
beholden to the cult’s hierarchy. Whether it’s possible to rescue them
from this possession is up to the GM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;player-tie-ins&quot;&gt;Player Tie-Ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Devil’s Pawn is on a collision course with the Ashmadai, who will make big
efforts to recruit them. They will also go after people who look like they can
rise to positions of power in Neverwinter, like the Noble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the cult tries to actively recruit the PCs or not, they can certainly
use their services against the aboleth menace. PCs who would never accept
working with diabolists might be approached by disguised agents intending to
point them at their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not actually stated anywhere within this entry, but other places in the
book say the Ashmadai control the above-ground portion of Oghma’s temple,
meaning Oghma’s Faithful is very likely to end up fighting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ashmadai are hard at work trying to infiltrate New Neverwinter, but they
haven’t managed to make any progress with Mayor Soman Galt (who, as we saw, is a
pawn of the aboleths already). Mordai himself is busily trying to convert
General Sabine of New Neverwinter to his cause, and has a good shot of managing
this as her natural disposition is compatible with the cult’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Abolethic Sovereignity is the competition, and they’re ahead. The cultists
ideally want to seal the chasm leading to their base, or otherwise drive them
off permanently, but they’re not even close to accomplishing this. The only
reason the Ashmadai are still around is that the aboleths don’t consider them a
serious threat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, the Ashmadai are nominally serving the Thayans while looking
for a way to break free of that servitude. They only do the minimum to prevent
Valindra from suspecting them, but their rebellious plot is doomed to failure as
Valindra does not have that relic scepter any more - she shipped it back to
Szass Tam as soon as she was done showing it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cult looks at the Netherese with much more genuine awe, though. They’ve
begun holding secret talks to forge an alliance, though they’re still having to
keep that hidden from the Thayans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as major factions go the Ashmadai are kinda weak. All of their major
goals and strategies lead them down a path that ends in a face-first collision
with one of the factions. They can’t recover the scepter because it’s not here
any more. They can’t corrupt New Neverwinter entirely because the aboleths got
there first. The direct approach to conquest doesn’t work because all the other
would-be conquerors are stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there’s a small chance that campaign events and PC actions end up
giving them a leg up, if only because the PCs open a power vacuum the cult can
exploit. I myself am not inclined to make them into a major threat, because it’s
always refreshing to have a group of villains you can easily stomp into the
ground.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Underwater Dungeon Fantasy</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/octopus-carnival/assets/geoffrey-ernault-skeletonpirateslq.jpg&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a
  href=&quot;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/3dvodY&quot;&gt;Illustration by Geoffrey Ernault&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underwater adventuring is one of those things that older editions of Dungeons
and Dragons seemed to like more than their players did. Lots of monster books
included a selection of monsters that could only be encountered under the sea,
but every bit of commentary I read on those was always about how no one ever
bothered to include submarine delves in their campaigns. If a sea monster
couldn’t go up to the surface to attack a ship or climb on its deck, it was
usually ignored by GMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dungeon Fantasy lines learned this lesson well, and don’t spend a lot of ink
on support for underwater adventures. This was a big problem for me when I was
GMing Hell’s Rebels to a group of friends. This particular adventure path
follows the old tradition of making PCs spend a chunk of levels 5-8
underwater. When I got to that part in my GURPS conversion, I had no idea what
to do and got a bit stressed out trying to figure this out on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frantically researching rules in real time is no fun at all even when I am the
only player, so for the benefit of my solo Hell’s Rebels game and any future
run-throughs with actual players, I’m going to collect everything I know about
fighting underwater in GURPS right here in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit I don’t have all the officially published primary sources that discuss
underwater adventuring. The ones I’m using are &lt;strong&gt;DF: Exploits&lt;/strong&gt; and the
simplified rules that can be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com/2019/01/simplified-df-underwater-combat-revised.html&quot;&gt;Dungeon Fantastic&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;
reference the sources I don’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;underwater-fighting-for-land-lubbers&quot;&gt;Underwater Fighting For Land-Lubbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not an aquatic creature, you use these rules when fighting underwater.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your Move is limited to your Swimming move: Basic Speed/5, minimum 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of your skills are capped at the level of your DX-based &lt;strong&gt;Swimming&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thrusting and unarmed strikes receive no penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some grappling techniques won’t work. Others work as normal. GM adjudicates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Swinging attacks with Reach 1+ weapons are impossible. This does cover pretty
much every weapon listed in DF: Adventurers, as even small knives have a Reach
of “C, 1” when swung.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shield bashes are -2 x DB to hit and do half damage. Don’t bother trying.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blocks are impossible but you still get your shield’s DB.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Parries with Reach 1+ weapons are impossible. Parries with close-combat-only
weapons like daggers, and unarmed parries, are allowed and suffer no
penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dodge is possible and not penalized, but you can’t Retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No thrown ranged attacks, even from Missile spells. Special underwater ranged
weapons exist and use specific stats.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ranged attacks into our out of water have -4 to hit, 1/10 range, and do half
damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All through this, you’ll be holding your breath under Heavy Exertion (DF:
Exploits p. 21)!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;underwater-fighting-for-fish-and-fish-people&quot;&gt;Underwater Fighting for Fish and Fish-People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water adaptation in GURPS has two main components. One is the ability to
&lt;em&gt;breathe&lt;/em&gt; underwater. The other is the ability to &lt;em&gt;move freely&lt;/em&gt; while
submerged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In monsters, the first is handled by traits such as &lt;strong&gt;Gills&lt;/strong&gt;, some variety of
&lt;strong&gt;Doesn’t Breathe&lt;/strong&gt;, or the ability to hold their breath for a really long time
even in combat. A combatant with one of these traits doesn’t need to worry about
the standard Breath Holding rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is handled by the &lt;strong&gt;Amphibious&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Aquatic&lt;/strong&gt; traits. If you have
one of these traits, you get a lot of advantages over land-lubbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your get to use your full Move and skills, not limited by your Swimming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are exempt from most skill penalties from being underwater and from many
Swimming tests.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can Retreat!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your other attacks and defenses are limited as for land-lubbers. This is
important for weapon users, not so much for aquatic beasts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-delver-to-diver&quot;&gt;From Delver to Diver&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a typical delver belonging to one of DFRPG’s standard ancestries, then
you fall squarely in the “land-lubber” category, and you have to solve a couple
of problems before you can dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;breathing&quot;&gt;Breathing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want your underwater life expectancy to be measured in seconds, you
need to find a way to breathe in there. In most typical DF settings, that means
magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spells&quot;&gt;Spells&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DFRPG boxed set includes two main drowning-prevention measures: the
&lt;strong&gt;Breathe Water&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Hold Breath&lt;/strong&gt; spells. They have different
prerequisite chains but work the same, letting you ignore that part of the rules
for as long as they last. Both have a base duration of 1 minute and an energy
cost of 4 to cast and 2 to maintain, reduced by skill as normal. Hold Breath
is a little better because it also let you survive in non-watery environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their main disadvantage is that their duration is relatively short. Unless the
PC casting these spells has a skill of 20 or more with them, the affected
character is only going to be able to remain underwater for a few minutes at a
time. That’s nowhere near enough for a full delve, and it’s an even shorter time
if you need to maintain this spell for multiple PCs. If the caster &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have
skill 20 then things get a lot easier, but that costs a lot of points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;items&quot;&gt;Items&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we expand our scope a little to look at DF supplements, then we see that
Dungeon Fantasy Magic Items 1 has an alchemical &lt;strong&gt;Water-Breathing Amulet&lt;/strong&gt;. You
can breathe underwater as long as you wear it… but it costs an amazing
$23.400. Outfitting a party of 5 with that is a very expensive proposition,
unless you find them as treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reusable casting item like a wand or ring with the Breathe Water spell would
cost at least $8200. This basic version would be powered by the user, so it has
the same duration limits as the spell. Doubling the price would halve the energy
cost, which is better but not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if we expand our scope even further and break out of the DFRPG bubble,
we can go to GURPS Magic and find an alchemical &lt;strong&gt;water-breathing elixir&lt;/strong&gt; that
costs $600 in a setting with common magic and gives you the ability to breathe
water for 1d hours! Even a minimal roll gives you a nice amount of time to
explore, and per that book’s rules you’ll know the duration is about to expire 5
minutes in advance, which is better than nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That elixir is clearly the best approach for campaigns where underwater delves
are a sometimes thing. They’re a little less convenient than the amulet, but the
price can’t be beat. I’m definitely including this in my campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moving&quot;&gt;Moving&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless your delvers are willing to spend the time and points to become
better-than-Olympic swimmers, solving their underwater movement issues also
means resorting to magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;spells-1&quot;&gt;Spells&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DF: Spells gives us two options here: &lt;strong&gt;Swim&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ethereal Body&lt;/strong&gt;. The first
makes the subject effectively Amphibious, the second makes them intangible and
thus able to ignore all that water. GURPS Magic additionally gives us &lt;strong&gt;Walk
Through Water&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes the user intangible only to water and ice. This
means you don’t enjoy 3D movement while underwater… but your maneuvers in
combat are unrestricted! I think I can kinda see why this one didn’t make the
cut to the DFRPG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with water-breathing, our biggest limitation here are spell maintenance
costs, which limit our unimpeded movement to a few minutes at most. These are
also harder to completely eliminate, since Ethereal Body costs 4 energy per
minute to maintain and the others cost 3. Still, a caster could conceivably save
these for when a fight is about to start, and only cast it on the group’s
physical fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;magic-items&quot;&gt;Magic Items&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t find an always-on item with a Swim enchantment in the books I own. A
basic casting item for Swim will cost at least $20500, almost as expensive as
the always-on water breathing amulet. Lowering its casting/maintenance cost from
6/3 to 3/2 doubles the price, lowering it to 2/1 quadruples it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might built this as a charged item instead, with each charge giving you 2
minutes of Swim time and costing 9 energy. A non-rechargeable item would cost
$1350 per charge, a rechargeable one $2700 (plus $180 per charge to reload).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Walk Through Water is allowed in the campaign, an item with the same duration
per charge would be a tad cheaper: $910/$1820/$140.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any of these cases, the item is best used sparingly, in the same manner as
the spell. You activate it when it’s time for a big fight or a crucial skill
test, and rely on your Swimming lessons the rest of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optimal-strategies&quot;&gt;Optimal Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given all of the above, I think we can pretty easily arrive at an “optimal”
strategy for underwater expeditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your group is about to embark in a &lt;strong&gt;campaign centered around underwater
delving&lt;/strong&gt;, your PC party should include a caster who can use Breathe Water at
Skill-20, and also someone who can use Swim at Skill-15. A druid or wizard could
do both, a cleric can use Breathe Water and leave Swim to someone else. This is
a hefty investment, but worth it for the amount of use they’ll get out of
it. Every PC, caster or not, should also consider investing points into the
Swimming skill, because it can help conserve spell energy and is pretty useful
in itself. You might want to give them extra points for these purposes depending
on your desired power level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative here is for you to allow players to make PCs from ancestries that
have an easy time underwater. Both Sea Elves from GURPS DF 3 and &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2018/10/10/elder-scrolls-others.html&quot;&gt;Argonians&lt;/a&gt;
from this blog have Gills and are Amphibious. &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2017/09/17/dfrpg-warforged.html&quot;&gt;Warforged&lt;/a&gt; are a bit less
nimble but don’t need to breathe at all. Each delver who is a natural-born diver
will make the rest of the party’s life that much easier. For those who aren’t,
Water-Breathing Amulets make excellent treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re planning a standard campaign that features a &lt;strong&gt;one-off underwater
dungeon&lt;/strong&gt;, Water-Breathing Elixirs are the way to go, possibly supplemented by
one or two rechargeable Wands of Swimming. The elixirs should definitely be
easily available in a nearby town (perhaps it’s a coastal fishing village?). The
wands might be for sale as well, or might be found as treasure either before or
during the delve. Proper safety procedure is to carry two elixirs per
PC, saving the second one for the return trip if the first one wears off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you only have &lt;strong&gt;isolated underwater encounters&lt;/strong&gt;, we’re back to learned
spells, but they don’t need to have high levels. The submerged environment
becomes an additional challenge, but no one is going to spend too long inside
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell’s Rebels in particular fits the second category, so I’ll be using that
solution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Play Hell's Rebels!</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell's_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a Let’s Read of Hell’s Rebels way back when it was new, in 2017. I had
gotten the campaign’s first three volumes with alongside a huge pile of other
Pathfinder PDFs in one of Humble Bundle’s offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to publish articles about the first three of those books here, though
I kinda stalled out between volumes 2 and 3. I still want to “Let’s Read” the
rest one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post, and the series it starts, are about something a bit different. You
see, ever since I got those books I also had a desire to &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt; this campaign,
but I didn’t want to do so using Pathfinder 1e’s default system. No, I wanted,
and still want, to use the Dungeon Fantasy RPG for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually did it, too! This was during the thick of the pandemic here in
Brazil, so I ran it on Roll20 with a group of friends. We got through the first
two adventures, but I ended up stopping that campaign because the combined
workload became a bit too heavy for me. I had to convert everything, prepare
battle maps and tokens for Roll20, adjudicate setting developments in response
to PC actions, and do all of that on time for the next session in two weeks
while juggling all the other stress sources those interesting times produced for
me and my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still wanted to go through the whole thing, whether as a GM or as a player. As
a GM, I no longer had any confidence I could prepare everything I needed on
schedule. As a player, I had that peculiar problem where the only person I knew
who wanted to run that adventure in the exact way I wanted to play it was
me. Clearly, there was only one solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-this-thing-as-a-solo-campaign&quot;&gt;Running this thing as a solo campaign&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually decided to run Hell’s Rebels for myself as a solo campaign way back
at the beginning of 2023, but it took until the start of June for me to finally
find the inspiration I was lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This won’t be my first “solo” campaign: I ran through the first two Zeitgeist
adventures that way between 2015 and 2017, give or take a year. That attempt
lost steam due to the issues I’m about to discuss, but it was pretty fun while
it lasted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My solo campaign attempts don’t have much in common with others I’ve seen
online. Those games tend to be quite minimalistic, with a single protagonist run
by the solo player, a setting sketched in broad strokes, and some sort of
“divination engine” taking the place of the GM. There is no pre-defined plot at
all - it’s entirely decided by asking questions to the engine and interpreting
its answers. The protagonist might have a starting goal, but how hard that is to
reach and what happens on the way are determined randomly. Note-taking seems
pretty minimal, unless the player in question wants to post actual play reports
online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that approach and it is in
fact the one I would recommend to most people who want to do a solo game. All of
the solo game products out there support it, and it is excellent at replicating
the experience of being a player in a game and not knowing what will happen
next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also not the approach I’m going to use for myself. I guess I’m built
different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference between this game and one using the “best practice”
approach outlined above is that I have a pre-defined module I want to run: the
Hell’s Rebels Adventure Path. Not only do I want to play that, I’ve already read
the first four volumes quite closely. While I find it easy to “forget” this
stuff when I’m just a player, here I’m also the GM, which makes separating this
knowledge impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, I have this weird desire to run it in a way that mirrors a
standard party-based campaign with multiple players as closely as possible. I
want a &lt;em&gt;party&lt;/em&gt; of heroes, and I want to be both player and GM at the same
time. I want it to be GURPS, and I want to interact with the mechanical widgets
of that system because I find them fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, I don’t want to just keep a minimal set of notes. I’m not gonna
write things as a novel or anything, but I kinda want to see the game’s events
rendered as a reasonably comprehensive actual play report of the sort I see in
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Dungeon Fantastic&lt;/a&gt; blog. I’d do that even if I &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; intend to post
them publicly - it’s what I did for Zeitgeist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-im-doing-this&quot;&gt;How I’m doing this&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My strange preferences bring two big risks to this endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is the lack of an “information barrier” between player and
GM. This barrier and the dramatic tension it brings do not exist when player and
GM are the same person. The usual strategies for separating in-character
knowledge from out-of-character information do not work here, at least for
me. This gives me the strange simultaneous feeling that I’m “cheating” (as a
player) and “going too easy on the PCs” (as a GM). This is obviously an obstacle
to fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue is with preparing maps and tokens. Sure, this would be much
easier on me if I ran everything in the theater of the mind, but I like moving
figures around on a battle map. The problem on my earlier attempts was that I
would usually leave the &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt; of those battle maps to the very last second,
when I’d be in a rush to get on with the action. This also means I never took
the necessary time to familiarize myself with the software I was using. So I’d
stall, and procrastinate, and take two months to finish something that could
have been done in a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve both of these issues, I’m going to make a resolution to never wear the
GM and player hats at the same time. The GM hat is for preparation. The player
hat is for “actual play”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-gm-hat&quot;&gt;The GM Hat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During preparation, I’m going to consider myself a mix of GM and designer and
I’m going to lean on my newly-discovered feelings of Miniature Envy. You see, a
lot of the online friends I’ve made in the past year and a half are very much
into tabletop wargaming. They have extensive miniature collections and extremely
well-organized workspaces for assembling and painting them. They often post the
results of their work online and it always looks awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have neither the space, skill, nor the budget to do the same thing, but I
&lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; look at the process of building battle maps and actor tokens in GCS,
TokenTool and Foundry with the same sort of perspective. Learning how to use the
software and actually building the things, then, becomes a hobby in itself. And
there’s no time or schedule pressure, so there’s no problem if I take a bit
longer in this part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will also be when I actually convert enemy stats, tests, and treasure from
the adventure’s original Pathfinder 1e to GURPS Dungeon Fantasy. I’ll try to
make them useful to others who want to try running the adventure in a more
traditional manner, but I won’t bother converting rules material for those paths
my PCs never take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also perform some significant “condensation” in the campaign. Like all
Pathfinder adventure paths, Hell’s Rebels includes a lot of filler fights
placed to give your PCs enough XP for them to hit the expected character levels
at the right times. It also features lots of elements that get added only on
later books but which could be relevant from the start. Neither of these things
are necessary in a Dungeon Fantasy campaign where the PCs already start out
powerful and advance in a completely different manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I have a large enough chunk of unplayed material, I’m going to take
off my GM hat and become a player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-player-hat&quot;&gt;The Player Hat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve the information barrier issue, I’m going to just learn to stop worrying
and love the cheese. When I’m wearing my player hat, it will be like I’m playing
a computer game with a walkthrough open. Sure, I might know what’s coming, and I
might even have a party custom-tailored to overcome those challenges, but the
&lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; of overcoming those challenges can still be quite fun. It can even
still be surprising, depending on what the dice tell me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It helps that this is the campaign whose main goal is punching fantasy
Nazis. Even if I know what’s coming, the actual process of going through it can
still be fun. Let us make awesome heroes tailored to the challenge and
completely stomp those fascist fuckers into the fucking ground! Let’s kick their
asses all the way to the Hell they came from! I want catharsis, dangit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also try to pay special attention to my characters’ disadvantages and
other traits, and obey the dictates of those self-control rolls. And when some
kind of question appears during the “actual play” part, I’m going to use
the Mythic GM Emulator to answer it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-in-this-for-you&quot;&gt;What’s in this for you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effort is going to generate a lot of material for this blog! I expect
readers will get some use out of my premade PCs, and out of the enemy stat
blocks I generate. Everything from those stats to the “actual play” reports and
design commentary is going to be published here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Abolethic Sovereignity Encounters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The table of standard monsters that make up the AbSov’s roster includes pretty
much every heroic-tier aberrant creature, from Fell Taints (MM2) to the weaker
varieties of Mooncalf (Threats to the Nentir Vale). It also includes Heroic-Tier
versions of iconic aberrants usually found in Paragon, and non-aberrant
creatures and humanoids that can act as covert agents or as the basis for
mutated monstrosities with the Plaguechanged Monster theme described here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll take a look at the new monsters, NPCs, and at the template here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aboleth-opener&quot;&gt;Aboleth Opener&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an aboleth specializing in brute-force psychic intrusion, “opening the
mind” of its victims using mental attacks and then dominating them for transport
to the underground base, where they will become test subjects. It’s a Large
Aberrant Magical Beast and a Level 7 Controller with 82 HP and the Aquatic
keyword. It has darkvision, a ground speed of 5, and a swim speed of 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Opener projects an &lt;strong&gt;Eroding Mucus Haze&lt;/strong&gt;, an aura (5) that is difficult
terrain for enemies and deals 5 psychic damage to any dazed enemy that starts
their turn inside. It can fight in melee with its &lt;strong&gt;Flaying Tentacles&lt;/strong&gt;, which
do immediate and ongoing damage, but it prefers to stick to mental attacks if
possible in order to avoid damaging the goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature’s title comes from its &lt;strong&gt;Mental Lance&lt;/strong&gt; ranged attack, which deals
psychic damage and dazes for a turn. It can then target dazed targets with
&lt;strong&gt;Enslaved Open Mind&lt;/strong&gt;, a minor action power that dominates the target (save
ends). This recharges whenever the Opener has no dominated victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aboleth-remnant&quot;&gt;Aboleth Remnant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not even the aboleths themselves are immune to Spellplague corruption. Exposure
tends to turn them into these Remnants, whose body constantly spawns and sheds
tentacles and other limbs, and whose mind is in tatters. Remnants can fly,
unlike typical aboleths. They’re treated like the rest of the base’s “trash”,
and sent up the chasm to harass Neverwinter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These wretches are Large Aberrant Magical Beasts and Level 5 Brutes with 78 HP
and the Aquatic keyword. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 5, a flight
speed of 7 (hover) and a swim speed of 10. They project an aura (2) of
&lt;strong&gt;Maddening Mucus&lt;/strong&gt;, which acts as difficult terrain for enemies and makes them
grant combat advantage while inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their attacks are a Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;Telescoping Tentacle&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and knocks
prone on a hit, and a &lt;strong&gt;Tentacle Flurry&lt;/strong&gt; that targets enemies in a Close Burst
2, damaging and dazing them on a hit (save ends). A miss here deals half
damage. This recharges when the creature is first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grell-strangler&quot;&gt;Grell Strangler&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This less-venomous variety of Grell is fond of strangling its victims. It’s a
Medium Aberrant Magical Beast with the Blind keyword. It has Blindsight 12, a
ground speed of 1, and a flight speed of 6 (hover).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its basic attack is a Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;Tentacle Lash&lt;/strong&gt; that deals physical damage and
forces the target to grant combat advantage for a turn. That last one seems to
be a poison effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the strangler isn’t grabbing anyone at the moment, it can use &lt;strong&gt;Grasping
Tentacles&lt;/strong&gt; to remedy the situation. This Reach 2 attack does a bit of physical
damage and grabs the target (escape DC 16). The grell can immediately shift 1
square and pull the victim up to 2 squares, and while the grab persists the
victim takes 5 ongoing damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the strangler grabs someone, it will use &lt;strong&gt;Haul Away&lt;/strong&gt; to do exactly
that. This move action lets it shift half its speed and drag a victim along with
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are great for separating the party and messing up their
formations. Defenders and controllers should focus on locking them down to
prevent that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nothic-plagegazer&quot;&gt;Nothic Plagegazer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This monster is entirely made by the chaotic magic of the Spellplague
pocket. Its gaze can inflict a debilitating spell sickness on its victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plaguegazers are Medium Aberrant Humanoids and Level 6 Artillery with 60
HP. They have a speed of 6, darkvision, and truesight 10. They exude an &lt;strong&gt;Oozing
Plague&lt;/strong&gt; from their skin that causes any creature that ends their turn adjacent
to the nothic to take ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nothic prefers to keep away from enemies and attack them with its
&lt;strong&gt;Sickening Gaze&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals necrotic damage, ongoing 5 poison damage, and
slows (save ends both). After the first failed save, the Slowed condition
worsens to Immobilized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also use an area attack named &lt;strong&gt;Spread the Infection&lt;/strong&gt;. This targets a
creature taking ongoing poison damage, and affects an Area Burst 1 centered on
them. It deals necrotic damage and inflicts ongoing 10 poison damage (save ends)
on those it hits. On a miss, it still inflicts half its immediate and ongoing
damage. It recharges when the nothic is bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it has no other choices, it will use its &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; in melee. They have no
riders, but Oozing Plague will probably be in effect here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nothic-mindwarp&quot;&gt;Nothic Mindwarp&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another nothic produced by the plague pocket. It’s more insane than usual, and
likes to caper and cackle about as it drives others mad with its gaze. It’s a
Level 3 Lurker with 42 HP and a Speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mindwarp will try to affect someone with its &lt;strong&gt;Warping Gaze&lt;/strong&gt;, a ranged
attack that deals psychic damage and forces the target to grant CA (save
ends). While the target is affected by this condition, the nothic becomes
invisible to everyone but the target, and its basic &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack does 1d6
extra damage. On a miss, the nothic still has partial concealment for a
turn. The power recharges when the victim saves against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the tactic here is to use Warping Gaze on someone, and then try to attack
&lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt; with enhanced claw attacks, repeating the procedure when the
gaze’s victim saves against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the nothic gets surrounded, it can use its &lt;strong&gt;Forbidding Glare&lt;/strong&gt; encounter
power to attack enemies in a Close Burst 2, dealing psychic damage and pushing
them 2 squares on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plaguechanged-monster-theme&quot;&gt;Plaguechanged Monster Theme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A monster &lt;em&gt;theme&lt;/em&gt; modifies a monster in a less drastic way than a monster
&lt;em&gt;template&lt;/em&gt;. Templates turn a regular into an elite or an elite into a
solo. Themes add a couple of flavorful powers without changing the monster’s
level or “quality”. They’re a great way to really tie a dungeon together, even
if the base creatures are very disparate otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plaguechanged monsters are affected by the Spellplague. They show the scars or
mutations associated with it, and possess magic abilities that use its
characteristic blue flames and corruptive effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was mistaken before - plaguechanged monsters do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; gain the ability to
sense spellscarred PCs, nor do they suffer defense penalties against these
PCs. To create one, you just add one attack and one utility power to the base
creature from the sets provided here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attack powers include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Fire Burst&lt;/strong&gt;: Encounter, triggers when first bloodied. Close burst 2
vs. Reflex, deals fire and force damage, pushes 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inferno Step&lt;/strong&gt;: Teleport 5 squares and attack a Close Burst 1 on
arrival. This deals fire damage and knocks prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scouring Lash&lt;/strong&gt;: At-will reach 2 melee attack, deals fire and force damage
and slides 1 square on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unraveling Touch&lt;/strong&gt; Encounter reach 1 melee attack, deals necrotic damage and
dazes (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attack and damage from all of these are expressed in terms of the base
creature’s level, so they can be applied to any monster from any book - even
minions, as the DMG2 has rules for applying themes to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Utility powers include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burning Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; Encounter, minor action. Invisible or otherwise hidden
enemies within 5 squares of the creature glow with blue flame, losing the
benefits from cover and concealment and granting combat advantage until the
end of the creature’s next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devourer of Flame&lt;/strong&gt;: Encounter, triggers in reaction to taking fire
damage. The creature gains temporary HP equal to half the fire damage, and a
+4 bonus do damage rolls until the end of its next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wings of Blue Fire&lt;/strong&gt;: Encounter, move action. The creature flies its speed,
and anyone making opportunity attacks against it during this movement takes
fire damage equal to the creature’s level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rohini-the-prophet-of-helms-hold&quot;&gt;Rohini, The Prophet of Helm’s Hold&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have a surprise NPC big-shot belonging to the AbSov faction. Rohini is
the person in charge of Helm’s Hold, which as we saw before has been converted
into a hospital for Spellplague victims and has a Realms-wide good reputation
for its humanitarian efforts. This is where we learn that the Hold is a front
for the Abolethic Sovereignity, and Rohini is their agent. There was already
some mention of it in the New Neverwinter section, but this one gives us the
full details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prophet of Helm’s Hold presents herself as an attractive and charismatic
female human, but she’s something fair weirder. Not long ago, she was a succubus
summoned by the Ashmadai and tasked with infiltrating the spellscarred treatment
center in Neverwinter’s House of Knowledge. There, a priest corrupted by the
Sovereignity exposed her to an artifact named the Hex Locus, a solidified chunk
of Spellplague magic. This warped the devil and infused her with the same
essence that turns humans into foulspawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohini’s main mission is to safeguard the Locus, which she moved to Helm’s
Hold. Her secondary goal is to collect new Choir candidates from among the
Hold’s patients and send them to the underground base. She is called the Prophet
because she makes statements about future events that tend to come true (due to
AbSov meddling). Her healing blessings are entirely fake, and make patients feel
good just as their condition steadily worsens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohini has stats very similar to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2019/12/15/succubus.html&quot;&gt;standard succubus&lt;/a&gt;, making her a Level 9
Controller. There are some important differences, though. She’s Aberrant instead
of Immortal. Her basic Corrupting Touch is upgraded to a &lt;strong&gt;Maddening Touch&lt;/strong&gt;
that does psychic damage and slides 2 squares. Her Charming Kiss turns into a
&lt;strong&gt;Soul-Wrenching Kiss&lt;/strong&gt; that places more restrictions upon the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As before, the victim of the kiss is unable to attack the succubus, but they
also can’t willingly move away from her, closing the main loophole in the basic
succubus’ power. They also take 10 ongoing fire and psychic damage while under
the effect of the kiss. All of this is a (save ends) package, and it also ends
when Rohini attacks the victim or uses the kiss on someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her Loyal Consort power is upgraded to &lt;strong&gt;Mind-Warped Bodyguard&lt;/strong&gt;. Now it works
as long as the victim of the Kiss is within 5 squares of Rohini, and lets them
teleport to switch places before redirecting attacks to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chartilifax&quot;&gt;Chartilifax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This complicated name belongs to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2020/01/16/green-dragon.html&quot;&gt;young green dragon&lt;/a&gt; who used to inhabit
the Neverwinter Wood, and which Rohini managed to seduce and
subvert. Experiments performed by the AbSov’s foulspawn sorcerers have given him
the ability to transform into a Medium humanoid like his master, and the
Devourer of Flame power from the Plaguechanged theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chartilifax spends most of his days in the shape of a green-skinned elf in the
basements under Helm’s Hold, performing menial tasks. He’s also pretty close to
Rohini’s seat of power, so he’s gonna be there as a nasty surprise when the PCs
manage to corner her.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Neverwinter: Abolethic Sovereignity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, one of the things the Spellplague did a century ago was to
bring parts of the world of Abeir into Toril, and vice-versa. These transplanted
chunks of geography also brought whoever happened to be living on them. And one
of these whoevers was the Abolethic Sovereignity, a kingdom ruled by these
aberrant creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after arriving, the Sovereignity built a flying citadel named Xxiphu to
act as their headquarters. Interested in studying the phenomenon that isekaied
them, the aboleths started searching for pockets of the chaotic magic that makes
up the Spellplague and sending in research teams to investigate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the pockets they found was in the Underdark beneath Neverwinter. A branch
of the Sovereignity built a permanent base around it and have been studying it
for the past few decades, occasionally kidnapping people from the surface to
serve as test subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the eruption happened, it opened a chasm on the surface that went all the
way down to the aboleth base, potentially exposing it to curious delvers from
the surface. Moving the base was not an option, so they instead fortified it and
began sending the results of their early experiments up the chasm as a way to
discourage explorers. This worked for a long time, since the city was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Neverember arrived and began rebuilding, the aboleths felt threatened and
began taking more active steps to divert the lord’s attention elsewhere and to
infiltrate his organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a century of research the aboleths have a pretty good handle on the
properties of the Spellplague, and they have a planned use for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, they know where Maegera is. Their entry in the book off-handedly
remarks that it was a brief awakening of the primordial that caused that
city-destroying eruption. The AbSov’s ultimate plan is to expose the primordial
to the Spellplague, using the techniques they developed to then dominate her
mind or control her in some other fashion. With a genuine primordial under their
command, the Sovereignity has a real shot at taking over the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, they’re using that expertise on a steady stream of victims
brought from the surface by their agents. These unfortunates are exposed to the
Spellplague in a controlled manner. Those who fail to display the proper
strength of mind and soul after initial exposure to the Plague become the
monsters regularly released upon the surface. Those who pass this test are then
subject to a very specific series of tortures and procedures that turn them into
near-mindless members of the Choir that sings the Symphony of Madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Symphony can channel the chaotic energies of the Spellplague in ways that
the aboleths can control, and it’s what they use to mutate their kidnapped
victims. They also use it to broadcast nightmares all over the region, which
afflict its more psychically sensitive individuals. The stronger it gets the
more people are affected. This could eventually be the tool they use to tame
Maegera, or could lead to the development of that tool depending on the GM’s
designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;player-tie-ins&quot;&gt;Player Tie-Ins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nightmares mentioned in the descriptions of Oghma’s Faithful and the
Spellscarred Harbinger come from the Symphony of Madness. The latter in
particular has very strong thematic ties to the AbSov - their starting hook
sends the PC right into their clutches, as we’ll see soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the GM decides to make the AbSov a major antagonist in the campaign, then the
Symphony’s nightmares will likely begin affecting more and more people. Its
effects are not set in stone, but the book gives various suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They might make victims irritable and violent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They might drain healing surges after a long rest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They might impost long-lasting penalties from lack of sleep or psychological
trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;They might provide hints about where to find their source.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepping up the frequency or severity of these effects over the course of the
campaign will provide a very strong incentive for PCs to find the source of
these dreams and shut it down, leading to a big confrontation against the AbSov
in their home base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way the PCs might protect themselves from the nightmares is to buy these
creepy little dolls sold by Helm’s Hold. If you place one of these Dreamthief
Dolls under your pillow at night, you won’t experience the nightmares. Rumor has
it that the dolls send the nightmares they catch to the Hold’s patients, but
Rohini, who runs the hospice at the Hold, says they’re just imbued with minor
protective blessings (she’s lying; the rumors are true).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relationships&quot;&gt;Relationships&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already know the AbSov is busily infiltrating New Neverwinter. Here we also
learn that they sort of disdain the Ashmadai, because all of the cult’s attempts
to infiltrate them have only fed them more converts (including Rohini). They are
however more circumspect when dealing with the Thayans or the Netherese, because
they fear the powerful magic those factions might be able to bring to bear if
they call on their far-away epic bosses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;impressions&quot;&gt;Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a comparatively huge entry with an extensive encounters section, as
we’ll see in the next post. This leads me to think the Aboleths are intended to
be one of the campaign’s top antagonists. A campaign where you start opposing
(or even working for) New Neverwinter and uncover the aboleth conspiracy seems
to be an easy one to make with the book’s default setup.&lt;/p&gt;
