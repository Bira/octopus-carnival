&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cacti are an important part of the Athasian ecosystem, and their natural water
collection mechanisms are often vital to allow people to survive in its
deserts. But in Dark Sun, sometimes the cactus drinks you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry presents two D&amp;amp;D Plant Monsters with that Darker and Sunnier edge to
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;zombie-cactus&quot;&gt;Zombie Cactus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most prized cactus species in Athas is the Flowering Oasis Cactus, a
beautiful plant whose sweet fruit can instantly satisfy someone’s hunger or
thirst. Finding one of those out in the desert can be a real lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Zombie Cactus takes advantage of this by looking exactly like a Flowering
Oasis Cactus to draw its victims in. Its fruit is just as sweet, but it’s filled
with mind-affecting poison nectar that dominates those who eat it. If the victim
is too wary to eat, the cactus can release a cloud of spores that has the same
effect before uncoiling its tendrils to deal with anyone still free. People
killed while under the cactus’ influence immediately raise as zombie cactus
thralls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is way too evil to be a coincidence. Sages believe zombie cacti are
an engineered bioweapon, the work of slavers employing psychic powers and
defiling magic. The creatures proved too uncontrollable to be used as tools, and
enough escaped their creators to take root in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zombie Cacti are Large Natural Magical Beasts with the Plant tag. Yes, they’re
intelligent. They’re also Level 11 Elite Lurkers with 182 HP, Tremorsense 10,
and a ground speed of 2 with Earth Walk. Yes, they’re ambulatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll usually find the cactus in its &lt;strong&gt;Innocuous Form&lt;/strong&gt;, which is nearly
identical to a flowering oasis cactus (Nature DC 27 to notice the
difference). It can do nothing in this state except assume its true form as a
minor action. While disguised, the cactus has Resist 15 all and
Regeneration 5. Wearing the disguise again takes a standard action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A disguised cactus is still dangerous because of its &lt;strong&gt;Poison Fruit&lt;/strong&gt;, described
as a passive trait. It will have between four and eight of these, which can be
eaten by another character as a minor action. Anyone who eats them is dominated
by the cactus (save ends). A dominated victim who is reduced to 0 HP can no
longer save against this. Note there’s no attack roll here - eat the fruit, get
dominated, period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the jig is up, the cactus uncoils and releases a cloud of &lt;strong&gt;Dominating
Spores&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 3 vs. will), which has the same effect as the fruit on a
hit. The burst also creates a spore-filled zone that inflicts -5 to saves
against zombie cactus domination for a turn. This power recharges when the
cactus uses Innocuous Form, giving us our “lurker loop” (breathe out, breathe
in).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once enough people are dominated, the cactus will use its &lt;strong&gt;Tendrils&lt;/strong&gt;, which do
standard damage and an additional ongoing 10 necrotic (save ends) if the target
is dominated by the cactus. &lt;strong&gt;Lashing Tendrils&lt;/strong&gt; lets it attack two different
targets with this attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone dominated by the cactus dies, they become a Zombie Cactus Thrall at
the start of their next turn. This zombie is a Level 11 Minion Brute. It can
&lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Grab&lt;/strong&gt; for the same amount of damage, but it prefers the later
because it can pull grabbed targets along with itself when it moves (probably
closer to the cactus). When it drops to 0 HP, it releases a &lt;strong&gt;Spore Burst&lt;/strong&gt; in a
Close Burst 1 that has the same attack bonus and effects as the cactus’ cloud!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the PCs want to resurrect a victim of the cactus, they must destroy the
corresponding thrall first. After that, the usual rituals can be applied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hunter-cactus&quot;&gt;Hunter Cactus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t engineered bioweapons. They’re “merely” fast, aggressive predators
that pose as innocent plants and use their venomous spines to drain the blood of
their prey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Hunter Cactus is a Large Natural Magical Beast with the Plant tag, and a Level
12 Lurker with 82 HP. It has Tremorsense 20 and a ground speed of &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the hunter cactus stands still, it takes a DC28 Nature check to realize
it’s not a mundane plant. It will probably begin its attack with a &lt;strong&gt;Spine
Burst&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 3 vs. Reflex, recharge 5+). It deals no damage right away,
but inflicts 20 ongoing poison damage and blindness (save ends both)! From then
on it will use its &lt;strong&gt;Feeding Spine&lt;/strong&gt; on any blinded creatures, damaging and
grabbing them on a hit. It can grab up to two creatures this way. A minor action
lets it sustain all grabs and auto-damage the grabbed creatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the cactus cannot run away with grabbed creatures, so it will stand
its ground and fight any remaining foes with &lt;strong&gt;Slams&lt;/strong&gt; that deal standard damage
and ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends). If the cactus is hit while it has a
creature grabbed, the &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Feedback&lt;/strong&gt; reaction deals psychic damage to the
victim equal to the damage the cactus just took.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zombie cacti are found in the wild alone or in pairs, surrounded by thralls who
rise up to fight when the cactus reveals itself. Note they are &lt;em&gt;magical beasts&lt;/em&gt;,
and therefore capable of forming alliances with other creatures. Commonly, that
will be a wild predator who they train to draw victims to the cactus so they can
share the spoils. Sometimes other people will coerce a zombie cactus into
service, a fate it will always try to escape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter cacti are more amenable to cooperation with humanoids, who can easily
train them to attack only designated targets in exchange for a regular supply of
food. In these cases they will be found alongside other guardians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are neat, and very nasty. Cactus drinks you indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry goes on and on about how stupid brohgs are, but I think that’s
terribly unfair to them. They’re some of the nicest people we’ve met in this
reading so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four-armed giant-kin wander the wastes in small nomadic bands that
occasionally cross paths to trade gossip and partners. They’re extremely skilled
at surviving the environment in Athas, taking only what they need and leaving
little trace of their passage. Their strong primal magic tradition helps them
with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, being both big and relatively peaceful makes them frequent targets
for the many odious slaver organizations in this setting, so they often end up
captured and put to work as heavy laborers, muscle, or gladiators. Enslaved
brohg who manage to break free often seek employment as mercenaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brohgs have both an innate ability to sense arcane magic, and an intense
cultural distrust of it, as they associate all arcane magic with defiling and
believe it to be cursed. Very rarely, a brohg will be born with innate arcane
potential (like a PC sorcerer). These individuals end up exiled from their
communities, as they’re believed to be hosts to “evil spirits” and destined to
bring disaster. Left to fend for themselves with no support, they often end up
creating a self-fulfilling prophecy scenario and becoming cruel defilers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brohgs are Large Natural Humanoids with the Giant tag. They move at a relatively
slow speed of 6, and have low-light vision. They have four arms and are
ambidexterous, but that doesn’t translate into a specific trait in their stat
blocks - each one has different abilities related to training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brohg-hurler&quot;&gt;Brohg Hurler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hurlers are civilians without a lot of combat training, but they get by just
fine by throwing stuff really far away, be that stuff boulders or
enemies. They’re Level 10 Artillery with 82 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; attack lets them grab the target on a hit, which is
hilarious because they can then use &lt;strong&gt;Hurl Away&lt;/strong&gt; to throw them 10 squares at
another creature, further damaging the “ammunition” as an effect and making a
ranged attack against the second target. For rules purposes, this counts as a
push that leaves the hurled creature adjacent to the second target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no one’s stupid enough to get within arm’s reach of a hurler, they can hurl a
&lt;strong&gt;rock&lt;/strong&gt; instead, which does similar damage, pushes the target 2 squares, and
knocks it prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brohg-warrior&quot;&gt;Brohg Warrior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what a trained brohg combatant looks like. When a brohg community is
under attack, warriors step up to cover their retreat. This could also represent
an enslaved or mercenary brohg working for someone else. Warriors are armed with
2 spears, a shield, and a hand kept free to throw rocks. They’re Level 10 Elite
Soldiers with 212 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can attack with a &lt;strong&gt;spear&lt;/strong&gt; that marks for a turn or a thrown &lt;strong&gt;rock&lt;/strong&gt; that
knocks prone, and &lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt; lets them do that twice in an action in any
combination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Brohg Taunt&lt;/strong&gt; ability is a minor action that lets them mark everyone in
a Close Burst 2, and recharges when they’re bloodied. If a marked enemy within 2
squares moves, the brohg can use &lt;strong&gt;Battle Alacrity&lt;/strong&gt; to get a free attack on
them that does light damage and lets then shift 1 square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;brohg-renegade&quot;&gt;Brohg Renegade&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those banished sorcerers who went all in on defiling magic, and now
wanders alone or at the head of a villainous band, plotting to increase his
power. The Renegade is a Level 13 Solo Controller with 512 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defiler knows an &lt;strong&gt;Arcane Secret&lt;/strong&gt; that lets them roll saves against daze
or stun effects both at the start and end of its turn, even if that effect
doesn’t allow a save (i.e., by having a fixed duration instead). Its &lt;strong&gt;dagger&lt;/strong&gt;
basic attack is a &lt;em&gt;minor&lt;/em&gt; action that does normal damage, and a little bit of
extra force damage if the target doesn’t end their next turn at least two
squares away from the renegade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its standard actions are all spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entropy Belt&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10 vs. will) targets one to three creatures, dealing
psychic damage and pushing 3 squares on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defiling Vortex&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 3 vs. Fort, recharges when bloodied) deals no
damage on a hit, but instead knocks targets prone and weakens then (save
ends). Missed enemies take necrotic damage. At the end of all this, the
renegade gains 5 temp HP for every target it hit with the power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defiling Blast&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Ref, recharge 5+) does necrotic damage
and dazes (save ends). The renegade gains a +4 to all damage while any target
remains dazed by this power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as it suits a solo, we also get a ton of triggered actions. The renegade has
the same &lt;strong&gt;Variable Resistance&lt;/strong&gt; as a demon, usable 2 times per encounter. To
refresh our memories: the value of this resistance is 10, and when the renegade
takes elemental damage it can switch the resistance to resist that damage type
as a free action, up to the encounter limit, when the resistance retains its
final type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an enemy hits the renegade while granting combat advantage to it, the
renegade can cast a &lt;strong&gt;Wrath Sphere&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 1 vs. Fort) against that
enemy, dealing force damage and pushing it 2 squares on a hit. And when the
renegade is first bloodied, &lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Defiling&lt;/strong&gt; triggers to let it immediately
recharge and use Defiling Blast again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of stuff, but that’s a solo for you. Almost dragon-like, this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free broghs have no reason to quarrel with PCs unless provoked, and if that
happens the warriors will cover the retreat of the rest of the group while
hurlers help from further away. They might also keep several of the hardy beasts
described in this book, and they might help in a fight too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enslaved or mercenary individuals might be found in mixed sapient encounter
groups. Renegade defilers will often be &lt;em&gt;leading&lt;/em&gt; such a villain group. A single
renegade is a nice “welcome to paragon tier” boss fight. One plus some
lieutenants makes for a nice set piece battle for mid-paragon heroes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like their mechanics and I like parts of their lore, but as I already
mentioned I don’t like the way the book keeps saying how brohgs are stupid and
simple-minded, and how it manages to make them superstitious despite living in a
D&amp;amp;D world and having their own working magical tradition. Distrusting arcane
magic in Dark Sun is sensible, but having the brohgs do it because they falsely
believe it’s a curse from evil spirits is a step too far in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braxats used to be natural beasts long ago, but according to the book were
uplifted by a “grim magical influence” over centuries of exposure to become the
huge and extremely antisocial insectile/reptilian humanoids they are today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braxats view all relationships, including those with other braxats, in terms of
dominance and coercion. They treat anyone weaker than them with contempt at
best, viciously hate anyone they see as equals, and only grudginly submit to
those they perceive as stronger. Each group is smaller than the one before, of
course. They have a particularly hate for half-giants for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes one of Athas’ many shady organizations manages to convince young
braxats to work for them as muscle through either bribery or intimidation. This
never lasts long, as the creatures are incapable of forming true loyalties and
either leave or betray their bosses if they survive and grow strong enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That same emphasis on coercion also applies to braxat reproduction
(yikes!). Braxats reproduce when there’s enough surplus food to go around, and
lay their eggs in secluded caves and other similar shelters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braxats are Natural Humanoids, with young specimens starting at Large and adults
reaching Huge size. They have Speed 8, acid resistance that increases with tier,
low-light vision, and the &lt;strong&gt;Threatening Reach&lt;/strong&gt; trait, which means they can make
opportunity attacks against anyone inside their full melee reach, not just
adjacent enemies. They rely on their carapace for protection and use their fists
or heavy clubs as weapons. They can also spit acid and use psychic powers,
though the exact mechanics vary on each stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;braxat-juvenile&quot;&gt;Braxat Juvenile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A still-young individual that’s nevertheless old and large enough to strike out
on its own. As mentioned above, some juveniles are conditioned from an early age
to view another creature as its superior, but that only lasts until the braxat
grows large and smart enough to see it’s stronger. Mercenary arrangements tend
to last a bit more. Many juveniles never grow to see adulthood, dying during
their work as muscle for Athas’ various villainous organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Juveniles are Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They’re “merely” size Large, and have
Acid Resistance 10. Their melee attacks are reach 2 and consist of either a
basic &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; that marks for a turn on a hit, or a &lt;strong&gt;Thrash&lt;/strong&gt; ability that does
the same damage and knocks prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At range, they can use their &lt;strong&gt;Caustic Spit&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5 vs. Reflex) to deal
immediate and ongoing acid damage, also slowing the target (save ends
both). When a marked enemy within 3 squares tries to move away from the
juvenile, they can use a &lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic Barrier&lt;/strong&gt; as an interrupt to slide the
enemy back towards a square adjacent to the braxat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;braxat-raider&quot;&gt;Braxat Raider&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical adult specimen, now grown to Huge size. It wanders the wastes alone or
with a small band of followers, setting up camp near caravan routes or villages
that they periodically raid for livestock and people to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raiders are Level 14 Elite Soldiers with 280 HP. Their melee reach is 3, and
their acid resistance is 15. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;greatclubs&lt;/strong&gt; whose basic attacks
damage and slide 1 square on a hit, and mark for a turn as an effect. They can
also be used for &lt;strong&gt;Greatclub Sweeps&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) that target a Close Burst 2
and knock prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The raider’s acid spit is a &lt;strong&gt;Scathing Spray&lt;/strong&gt; (Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex,
recharges when first bloodied) that has similar effects to the juvenile’s spit
on anyone it hits, and does half damage on a miss. Its TK barrier evolves to
&lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic Harness&lt;/strong&gt; (immediate reaction), letting it pull marked enemies
that end their turns not adjacen to the raider up to 6 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also get an entirely new psychic power: &lt;strong&gt;Agonize&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10 vs. will)
deals psychic damage and slows for a turn, and doesn’t provoke opportunity
attacks when used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;braxat-lord&quot;&gt;Braxat Lord&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braxats who live to reach the peak of their power are strong enough to set
themselves up as regional despots, as only the most powerful creatures in Athas
can hope to win against them. They view pretty much anyone else as either
potential slaves, or potential meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Braxat Lord is a Level 23 Elite Soldier with 428 HP and 20 acid
resistance. Like the Raider, it’s Huge and its melee reach is 3. It fights with
a &lt;strong&gt;Maul&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and slides 2 squares on a hit, and marks for a turn as
an effect. It can attack at range with the &lt;strong&gt;Crushing Pain&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10
vs. Fort) psychic power, which deals psychic damage, immobilizes for a turn, and
slows for another turn as an aftereffect. The &lt;strong&gt;Attack Flurry&lt;/strong&gt; power lets it
use the maul twice and Crushing Pain once in the same standard action, against 2
or 3 targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its acid spit power is &lt;strong&gt;Vitriolic Spew&lt;/strong&gt;, a Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex that deals
immediate and ongoing acid damage. It also turns the blast area into lightly
obscured difficult terrain that deals acid damage to anyone ending their turn
inside, and lasts until the end of the lord’s next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The psychic powers don’t end there either! &lt;strong&gt;Overawe&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) is a minor
action Close Burst 10 that targets all creatures marked by the lord, deals
psychic damage, makes them grant combat advantage, and forbids them from using
opportunity or immediate actions (save ends both). And its &lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic
Harness&lt;/strong&gt; works like the raider’s but also restrains those pulled by it and
deals ongoing psychic damage (save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the encounter examples are pretty well described above. As for my
impressions, braxats seem to be some of the worst people in Athas, and that’s
saying something. They feel like Darker and Sunnier evil ogres or giants. The
three variants slot neatly into the ogre/giant/titan role, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do fey look like in a world whose environment as deeply fucked up as
Athas’? Let’s check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Belgoi (singular and plural are the same) lived in the Feywild before it was
destroyed in ancient Athasian history, and they weren’t the most pleasant of fey
back them. They took refuge in the world, but eventually came to hate it and all
its residents. Now they live to despoil everything they touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belgoi organize into small nomadic tribes led by the strongest member. They’ll
stop at a location and live there for a while, moving on when everything around
them is ruined, consumed, or polluted. They often go out hunting, and will eat
anything and anyone they can catch. They prefer sapient victims because they
think meat tastes better when seasoned with terror, and that eating someone lets
them absorb the victim’s power. That’s why they also eat their own dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eladrin are their preferred victims, since the belgoi blame them for the
destruction of their homelands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belgoi wear leather or hide armor, which I guess is true of most fighters on
Athas. They fight with claw or spear, and wield small bells which they use to
channel their magic. Ringing the bell allows them to lure targets closer for the
kill, isolating them from their peers and breaking their formations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes me think their name is a horrible pun (belgoi == “bell guy”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of them have the ability to drain a victim’s life force through the wounds
they inflict. You can see it seeping out and flowing into the creature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belgois are Medium Fey Humanoids with Speed 6 and Low-Light Vision. They speak
Common, and all of the stat blocks here are Chaotic Evil. Their signature trait
is that they’re &lt;strong&gt;Hungry For Blood&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes all their attacks deal extra
damage against bloodied targets. All of them also have a bell-related power,
which is a little different for each variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;belgoi-craven&quot;&gt;Belgoi Craven&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weakest and most cowardly of their number, hiding behind more powerful
warriors and waiting for the chance to pounce upon weak or isolated enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are Level 7 Minion Skirmishers, whose &lt;strong&gt;Craven Slink&lt;/strong&gt; gives them a +2
bonus to all defenses when adjacent to an ally (even another craven). Their
&lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; is a standard minion basic attack, and their &lt;strong&gt;Compelling Ring&lt;/strong&gt;
(ranged 10 vs. Will, Encounter) can slide the target 5 squares to a square
adjacent to the craven or one of their allies. Dangerous when the more powerful
variants are around!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;belgoi-stalker&quot;&gt;Belgoi Stalker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not every belgoi belongs to a tribe. Stalkers usually travel alone, but can
sometimes join up with mixed humanoid bands that have similar inclinations. They
will also opportunistically insert themselves into ongoing fights, trying to
lure a victim out while they’re busy with other enemies. And you can also just
say a given stalker is with a tribe too, of course. They’re Level 7 Lurkers with
63 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stalkers will star the fight at a distance, and use the &lt;strong&gt;Enticing Ring&lt;/strong&gt;
(Ranged 10 vs. Will) of their bells to lure a target. On a hit the target is
pulled 5 squares and dazed for a turn. The stalker then moves up and uses its
basic &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack, which deals light physical damage and ongoing 5 damage
(save ends). If the target is dazed, like they would be in this scenario, the
ongoing damage is increased to 15 and the &lt;em&gt;Stalker&lt;/em&gt; takes a -5 penalty to its
defenses until the start of its next turn, giving it an incentive to stay
away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;belgoi-hunter&quot;&gt;Belgoi Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunters are the main frontline units of a Belgoi attack, engaging enemies
directly with their spears and trying to make them vulnerable to the attacks of
their sneakier fellows. They’re Level 8 Soldiers with 89 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunters fight with their &lt;strong&gt;spears&lt;/strong&gt;, but instead of charging into the fray
they’ll try to draw enemies to them with the &lt;strong&gt;Ringing Attraction&lt;/strong&gt; of their
bells. This minor action power attacks the Will of all enemies in a Close
Burst 5. On a hit, the hunter pulls the target 3 squares and marks it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hunter can then use its &lt;strong&gt;Stakeout&lt;/strong&gt; attack against an enemy it has marked,
which deals the same damage as the basic spear strike and immobilizes the target
for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This set of powers is perfect for a tactic where hunters get the party’s
defenders out of position so a large horde of cravens or a stalker can slip
through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;belgoi-caller&quot;&gt;Belgoi Caller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Callers usually lead belgoi tribes and hunting bands. They’re visibly more
powerful than their followers, and have access to stronger magic and psychic
powers that help their allies and hinder their foes. Not every hunting band will
have a caller in it, but when they show up they’re bad news. Callers are Level 8
Elite Controllers with the Leader tag and 178 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can fight with &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; that damage and inflict ongoing 5 damage (save
ends), but their actions are better spent on their &lt;strong&gt;Ennui Lash&lt;/strong&gt; power (minor
action, melee 3 vs. Will), which does equivalent psychic damage and inflicts a
-2 penalty to Will for a turn. That opens the enemy up to their bigger powers,
and to the psychic attacks of their buddies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first big power is &lt;strong&gt;Command of the Bell&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 10 vs. Will, recharge
4+), which deals psychic damage, slides the target 3 squares, and forces them to
make an at-will attack against an ally of the caller’s choice. Not a basic
attack, an &lt;em&gt;at-will&lt;/em&gt; attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other big power is &lt;strong&gt;Distant Ringing&lt;/strong&gt; (area burst 3 within 10 vs. Will,
recharge when first bloodied), which deals psychic damage to enemies caught
inside and pulls them towards the center of the burst. Allies caught inside can
shift 1 square and roll a save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encounters with groups of belgoi are pretty similar to the ones described for
the lone stalker above. They creep around the party trying to stay undetected
until their targets are vulnerable or engaged in another fight, try to lure and
kill as many victims as they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ll use clever ambush tactics and take advantage of terrain as much as
possible, but don’t seem to like surrendering or talking. They always begin with
the ambush, and run away if things don’t go their way, possibly to return later
for revenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like their mechanics, but I’ll admit I can’t get over the pun. Bell
guys. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-baazrag.jpeg&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athas has no mundane Earth animals. Instead of wolves or dogs, you get these
things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baazrags are beetle-lizard things the size of large dogs. In their natural
environment, they’re desert predators organized in large but loose packs. Pack
members stick close to each other but most fend for themselves, feeding on weeds
and small animals and accumulating water in a sac under their shell. When one of
them detects large prey it alerts the others, and the entire pack works together
for the big meal ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All baazrags are born female, but only a few manage to reach the right size,
age, and biochemical triggers to become egg-laying breeders. When a breeder is
present, some of the other baazrags will become male, and will help fertilize
and defend the eggs. Breeders and other powerful baazrags have some innate
psychic sensitivity - proximity to psychic characters irritates them, making
them more hostile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bazraags are Natural Beasts with the Reptile tag. Like most monster tags, it
does nothing by itself but some effects may key off it. Most specimens are
Medium, but Whelps are Small and breeders are Large. Their signature trait is
&lt;strong&gt;Pack Harrier&lt;/strong&gt;, a passive trait which gives them combat advantage against any
target surrounded by two or more of their allies. They have a ground speed of 8,
so good lock outrunning them when they find you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;baazrag-whelp&quot;&gt;Baazrag Whelp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baazrags are capable of fighting from the moment they hatch, but they’re still
too vulnerable to strike out on their own and so stick close to their
mother. When they grow up a little more, they join the other members of the pack
in their semi-independent activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whelps are Level 1 Minion Skirmishers with the signature traits mentioned above,
plus the &lt;strong&gt;Scrambler&lt;/strong&gt; trait that lets them ignore difficult terrain when they
shift. Their &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; does the kind of damage you’d expect from a Level 1
Minion, which isn’t anything spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;baazrag-gnawer&quot;&gt;Baazrag Gnawer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particularly tenacious hunter that strays a bit further from the pack to act
as a scout. It’s usually the first to spot large prey and warn its companions,
and when it bites down it doesn’t let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gnawers are Level 1 Skirmishers with 29 HP and all the standard traits. It also
has the &lt;strong&gt;Latcher&lt;/strong&gt; trait, which gives it +2 AC when it’s latched onto a victim
(see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gnawer’s &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; does a lot of work here. It deals standard damage on a hit
and lets the creature latch onto the target, which works like a custom status
effect. While the gnawer is latched on a target, it moves when the target moves,
without provoking opportunity attacks, and can stop at any unoccupied square
adjacent to the target at the destination. It can obviously only latch onto one
creature at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the gnawer is latched, it can use the &lt;strong&gt;Gnaw&lt;/strong&gt; attack, which on a hit
deals heavy physical damage, ongoing 5 poison (save ends) and lets the creature
detach and shift 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between having a gnawer attached and being grabbed is that
the target is not immobilized. Therefore, even though the stat block doesn’t say
it, I’d let PCs treat it like a grab for purposes of escaping it early. On the
other hand, while a gnawer can only grab one target, &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; gnawers can
attach to the same target. Don’t let it happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as a move action, the gnawer can use &lt;strong&gt;Bounder&lt;/strong&gt; to jump 4 squares
without provoking opportunity attacks. This is at-will, so it’s a very slippery
creature if you don’t have a fighter with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;baazrag-swarm&quot;&gt;Baazrag Swarm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One whelp is nearly harmless, but the whole litter at once is bad news. This
is a Medium swarm, counting as a Level 3 Soldier with 46 HP. They have the usual
swarm resistances: half damage from melee and ranged attacks, vulnerable 5
against close and area attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all Swarms, this one can occupy the same space as its enemies, and its area
counts as difficult terrain. It cannot be pushed, pulled or slid by melee or
ranged attacks, and can squeeze past any opening big enough for an individual
member without penalty. In this case, the members are probably Small. It also
has Pack Harrier, and a &lt;strong&gt;Hinder&lt;/strong&gt; aura (1) that slows enemies who start their
turns inside. Being inside the swarm also counts as being inside the aura,
obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic melee attack is &lt;strong&gt;Bloodthirsty Swarm&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals extra damage
against prone targets. Their other attack is of course &lt;strong&gt;Pull Down&lt;/strong&gt;, which
damages and knocks prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things are &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; less dangerous &lt;a href=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2020/01/27/drakes.html&quot;&gt;needlefang drake swarms&lt;/a&gt;. They’re
higher level and do more base damage, but their aura doesn’t give them
additional free attacks against prone targets. This means they will probably
leave incapacitated PCs alone while other enemies remain in the map, though
those would still be fair game if nothing else is in reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;baazrag-breeder&quot;&gt;Baazrag Breeder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical baazrag who managed to grow and develop the ability to lay eggs. It’s
Large in size, and a Level 5 Brute with 77 HP. I’m guessing not every old-enough
baazrag will reach this state - it might be something related to hormones, like
in an insect hive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breeder upgrades her Pack Harrier trait to &lt;strong&gt;Pack Master&lt;/strong&gt;, and only needs
one other adjacent ally to gain Combat Advantage against a target. She can
attack with a basic &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack or with a &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; that deals bonus damage
against prone targets and inflicts ongoing 5 poison (save ends) on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also has psychic powers! &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Lure&lt;/strong&gt; is a minor action Close Burst 5
vs. Will that targets one enemy and pulls them 3 squares on a hit. And that
irritability when near other psychic sources translates into the &lt;strong&gt;Psychic
Provocation&lt;/strong&gt; reaction, which lets the breeder immediately charge anyone who
deals psychic damage to her once per turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Baazrags look like typical random encounters during wilderness travel, but
depending on how the PCs are doing in their trek they could also seek the
creatures out to harvest their water sacs and meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first sign of a baazrag pack is the lone scout that will make an effort to
call its buddies when it finds the party. Then they’ll swarm the prey and try to
pull it down for the kill, but will give up if they think the prey is too tough
and the fight is going against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breeders, if present, stay a bit further away and try to lure a lone victim with
Psychic Lure. If they manage it, they’ll attack the isolated PC with the help of
any nearby young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individual adult Baazrags could all be represented by gnawers, though you could
also reskin Gray Wolves from the Monster Vault as other baazrag adults. Any and
all of these might be found as members of humanoid encounter groups as guard and
war animals, just like the beasts they replace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if anakores appeared before. This is the first time I’ve read
about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little is known about the origins of these creatures. Ancient tales speak of a
terror from beyond the sky that touched their humanoid ancestors, causing them
to recoil from the sun and seek shelter underground. Over time, these ancestors
became today’s anakores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anakores live in small hunter-gatherer bands led by their most accomplished
tracker. They burrow beneath the desert sands during the day, and from there
they can feel the vibrations of prey passing overhead, and smell blood spilled
on the ground. When anakores detect prey, they can follow it all day by
tunneling through the sands, waiting until nightfall to spring their ambush from
below. Then they will fight with their powerful digging claws and their
paralytic bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While on the move, the creatures subsist on plant roots, including certain
poisonous species that help the formation of their venom. Rootless vegetation
spread around an area is a possible signt of anakore presence, though they’re
smart enough to clean this up if they intend to stay in place for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different band members specialize in different parts of an attack - some lead
the ambush, others strike to hurt and incapacitate victims, and yet others drag
those victims underground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess a lot of the time they prey on the local fauna, but anakores don’t mind
attacking sapient travellers, and judging from what the book says seem to prefer
it. They don’t have any visible sexual dimorphism, and rumor has it that they
reproduce by dragging some of their sapient victims to weird cocoons under the
sands. There, the victims are transformed into more anakores. No one knows what
criteria they use to select new candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anakores are Medium Aberrant Humanoids, which means they’re sapient. They have
low-light vision and Tremorsense 5, plus a ground speed of 5 with Earth Walk and
a burrow speed of 6 on loose earth only. They communicate in Deep Speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their signature traits are &lt;strong&gt;Dune Diver&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them charge while
burrowing, and &lt;strong&gt;Sensitive to Light&lt;/strong&gt;, which gives them a -2 penalty to attacks
for a turn when they’re exposed to direct sunlight or take radiant damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their poison is a rider on a different attack on every stat block, but the
effect is always the same: the target is slowed on a hit (save ends), worsening
to immobilized (save ends) after the first failed save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anakore-hunter&quot;&gt;Anakore Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the ones who drag people under. They’re Level 5 Lurkers with 48
HP. Their basic &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; attacks grab the target on a hit, and on their next
turn they can choose to either bite the victim or drag them under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; targets a grabbed creature and deals a bit less damage than the
claws, but applies the poison described above. &lt;strong&gt;Drag Under&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 1
vs. Fortitude) can target either immobilized or grabbed creatures. It deals more
damage than the claw, inflicts 5 ongoing damage and removes the target from play
(save ends both). When the effect ends the target reappears at its previous
position or on the closest unoccupied square. And even them they’re still
immobilized (save ends), so the hunter can try to drag them under again right
away instead of having to bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presumably, victims who drop to 0 HP by this attack would be dragged further
down and not come back up. Don’t let that happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anakore-render&quot;&gt;Anakore Render&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the one that hurts the prey and makes it more vulnerable to the
others. Renders are Level 7 Brutes with 96 HP and a ground speed of 7 instead
of the usual 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; do heavy damage on a hit, pushing the target 2 squares and
knocking it prone. Their &lt;strong&gt;blood frenzy&lt;/strong&gt; ablity (recharge 5+) lets them perform
two of these attacks in one action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a move action, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Blood Hunger&lt;/strong&gt; to shift 3 squares closer to a
bloodied creature. As a minor action, they can use a &lt;strong&gt;rending bite&lt;/strong&gt; against a
prone or bloodied creature, which does light physical damage and applies anakore
venom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anakore-dune-king&quot;&gt;Anakore Dune King&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often the leaders of a pack, Dune Kings signal the start of an attack by
bursting up from the ground in the middle of their targets and distracting them
so their fellows can attack the victims more safely. They’re Level 9 Skirmishers
with 94 HP and the Leader tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; damage and apply anakore poison on a hit, but the real threat
here is the &lt;strong&gt;Sand Eruption&lt;/strong&gt; ability (recharge 5+). The dune king must be
underground to start this, and the action lets him move 4 squares to a square
that’s not underground. The first time they enter such a square, they can
perform a Close Burst 2 attack that targets enemies and deals very heavy
physical damage on a hit, sliding the targets 2 squares. Additionally, each
anakore in the burst can shift 3 squares as a free action, and the area of the
burst becomes difficult terrain until the end of the encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Dune Kings can shift 1 square as a minor action using &lt;strong&gt;Sand Slide&lt;/strong&gt;,
which makes them as slippery as kobolds despite their size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anakore bands only hunt in places where they can burrow, which means the terrain
on the map will mostly be soft earth, sand, or silt. An anakore-only encounter
is the most common one, I think, but they can also appear with other burrowing
predators that they either trained, or which happen to be opportunistically
hanging around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also work with other sapients that pay them in food and trinkets for
doing what they were already going to do anyway, and you might also find them
in bizarre aberrant ruins on or under the surface, drawn there by strange dreams
and performing unspeakable rituals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anakores are smart enough to recognize when they’re in a poor situation, and
when they should negotiate instead of fighting. But if they think they should
fight, their underground ambushes can be pretty terrifying, as all of their
powers synergize very well and make the tactics described in the lore section
very effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their burrow speed lets them go back underground at will, meaning each Dune King
might be able to perform more than one Sand Eruption in a fight, and the Hunters
can move with relative impunity among the party to harass and grab the
PCs. Renders stay up top once they emerge, and all of them are immune to the
difficult terrain created by the Kings due to Earth Walk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I know Aarakocra first show up on the 1e Fiend Folio as relatively
peaceful and good-natured bird people. They’re like that in most of their
appearances, but just like with all everything else about this setting the
Athasian version is Darker and Sunnier(TM).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, Aarakocra are vulture-people, who band together in insular tribes for
survival in the harsh wastelands of Athas. They just want to be left alone to do
their own thing, but are understandably mistrustful of outsiders in a setting
full of slavers and sorcerer-kings. Each tribe claims a territory, and fiercely
defends it. Their settlements are built atop desert mesas and other high places,
and they use these vantage points to survey their territory for food and
intruders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreigners traveling through a tribe’s territory will be approached by the
aarakocra, who demand tribute in exchange for safe passage. Those who pay are
guided to safer paths or useful landmarks. The aarakocra attack those parties
who refuse, trying to kidnap some of their members for ransom. Some large
merchant houses make deals with the more powerful tribes, paying protection fees
in advance to avoid harassment from both the paid off tribe and any weaker ones
that might lie along the route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aarakocra have a long tradition of reverence for primal spirits of the wind and
sun. Many of them display the ability to cast primal spells, and they know
rituals to summon air elementals and other spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aarakocra are Medium Natural Humanoids (take that, Aristotle!). They have
low-light vision, ground speeds of 5, and fly speeds of 6. Their signature power
is &lt;strong&gt;Sly Takeoff&lt;/strong&gt;, a move action that lets them shift 1 square and then fly 5
squares. It’s very useful for disengaging from melee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aarakocra-diver&quot;&gt;Aarakocra Diver&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braver than most of their kin, these warriors like to fly high and dive at their
targets from an angle that leaves the sun at their backs, making it difficult
for the victim to spot them until it’s too late. They’re Level 6 Skirmishers
with 66 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divers fight in the traditional aarakocra style, gripping a Reach 2
&lt;strong&gt;longspear&lt;/strong&gt; in their prehensile feet while flying. “Brave” doesn’t mean
stupid, so they do everything they can to avoid getting bogged down in ground
combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their most likely maneuver is a &lt;strong&gt;Flyby Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, where they can move 6 squares,
and make a longspear attack against a target anywhere along the movement. If the
target grants combat advantage to the diver, the diver can also make a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;
attack as a minor action for a little extra bit of damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also make a more powerful &lt;strong&gt;Diving Charge&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+), which lets
them charge and make an extra strong longspear attack that also knocks prone on
a hit. They’ll likely need to use &lt;strong&gt;Sly Takeoff&lt;/strong&gt; to move away afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aarakocra-warrior&quot;&gt;Aarakocra Warrior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical vulture-folk warrior is not as mobile or brave as the diver, relying
on strength of numbers. They descend from the sky and try to stay just high
enough off the ground to stab with their spears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warriors are Level 6 Minion Skirmishers that fight with reach 1 &lt;strong&gt;Spears&lt;/strong&gt; which
do an extra point of damage on a charge. So they still want to charge in and use
&lt;strong&gt;Sly Takeoff&lt;/strong&gt; to move away when fighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aarakocra-windcaller&quot;&gt;Aarakocra Windcaller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priests and mystics trained in the aarakocra primal tradition, they know the
secret spells to command the wind and use it to fight. They’re Level 8
Controllers with the Leader tag and 82 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windcallers really lean into the whole “vulture-folk” thing for DS aarakocra,
since their powers seem to have a &lt;em&gt;stench&lt;/em&gt; theme in addition to a wind
theme. For example, their &lt;strong&gt;Carrion Scent&lt;/strong&gt; (aura 10) let flying allies inside
hover if they have a fly speed, and make them deal +4 damage to bloodied
enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their melee basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Wafting Claw&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and slows (save
ends) in a hit. On the first failed save, the target falls prone. They also have
a ranged basic attack, &lt;strong&gt;Foul Gust&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex) that damages and
slides 3 squares on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In less stinky news, they can also envelop a target in a &lt;strong&gt;Dust Veil&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged
10 vs. Reflex, recharge 4+) that damages and forces the target to treat any
nonadjacent creatures as having concealment (save ends). On the first failed
save, the target is blinded for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter they can also generate an &lt;strong&gt;Instant Whirlwind&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast
5 vs. Fortitude), which damages enemies, slides them 4 squares, and knocks them
prone on a hit. As an effect, it also lets allies inside the blast shift 2
squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters&quot;&gt;Encounters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aarakocra rarely work with other sapients, except maybe for the occasional
cooperation with kenku. They will however follow or lure dangerous predators who
live in their territory towards groups of intruders they want to kill, and then
swoop down to deal with the survivors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, their traditional ability to summon elementals is still here, now
as an off-screen ritual instead of something that has to happen mid-fight. So
it’s entirely possible for encounters to include elementals or other primal
spirits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as with any kind of sapient person in this hellish wasteland, they might be
found in the service of the many despots of Athas as enslaved scouts and
soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically I think these are mostly equivalent to traditional aarakocra in
terms of capabilities, but I like that their lore makes them a group PCs are
likely to deal with at some point, instead of putting them atop isolated
mountain ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the Dark Sun Creature Catalog!</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I write this, RPGnet forum user zedturtle is just starting a Let’s Read of
the Dark Sun Campaign Setting for 4e, and I thought I’d join in on the fun by
doing a parallel Let’s Read of the Creature Catalog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Creature Catalog was published alongside the Campaign Setting in 2010, and
is the “second to last” monster book published for D&amp;amp;D Fourth Edition. The last
one would be Threats to the Nentir Vale, which I already covered and which can
be read either &lt;a href=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/&quot;&gt;in my blog&lt;/a&gt; or on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.rpg.net/index.php?threads/lets-read-threats-to-the-nentir-vale.904788/&quot;&gt;RPG.net forums&lt;/a&gt;. It did still come
after the Monster Manual 3, and so enjoys the rules and formatting improvements
that came with that book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book opens up with a short description of the stat block format, and tells
us that the book is divided into two sections. “Monsters A to Z” is the kind of
thing you’ve come to expect from a monster book, and “Personages of Athas” is a
bunch of important NPCs and major villains like the Sorcerer Kings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fourth-edition-monster-rules-a-refesher&quot;&gt;Fourth Edition Monster Rules: A Refesher&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I posted something similar at the start of every monster book Let’s Read, and
I’ll do so again this time, since it’s been a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;level-and-role&quot;&gt;Level and Role&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike 3e and 5e, Fourth Edition D&amp;amp;D doesn’t have the concept of a “Challenge
Rating”. Monsters instead have levels ranging from 1 to 30, just like PCs. A
monster’s base attack bonus, damage, defenses, and HP are all based on its
level, with adjustments for its combat role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A monster’s combat role determines the monster’s baseline stats and most of its
preferred tactics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Skirmishers are highly mobile melee combatants.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soldiers have good AC, accurate attacks, and usually some ability that helps
draw PC attention to themselves. They form a “front line” that protects Team
Monster’s squishier damage dealers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brutes deal heavy damage and have more HP, but are a bit less accurate and
easier to hit. They’re also good components of the front line, particularly
when paired with soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Controllers are good at both melee and ranged combat, and have lots of area
attacks and other powers that impose negative conditions on PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Artillery monsters have strong and accurate ranged attacks, but are worse at
melee and kinda fragile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lurkers are fragile in a direct fight but have attacks that deal huge damage
if certain conditions are met. Most commonly, that’s when they attack from
hiding. They have abilities that let them re-establish that condition, so a
typical lurker will attack one turn and spend the next one hiding again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this “primary” role, there are some extra roles a monster might
have. An Elite monster is worth two regular monsters, with double the HP and
some ability to perform multiple attacks per turn. A Solo monster is worth five
regulars, has four times the HP, attacks that affect a large number of PCs at
the same time, and usually some resistance to being “stun-locked”. Minions are
weak monsters that deal half the damage for their level and always have 1 HP
(but cannot be damaged by missed attacks). Four to six minions are worth one
regular monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a monster tagged as a Leader will have abilities that enhance their
buddies somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blogofholding.com/?p=512&quot;&gt;famous post&lt;/a&gt; from the Blog of Holding has the individual monster design
formula written out as compactly as possible. This also shows us that it’s easy
to adjust a monster’s level on the fly, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;origin-and-type&quot;&gt;Origin and Type&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monsters also have an origin and a type, though that’s more of a lore component
and doesn’t affect mechanics like it does in 3e and 5e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origin tells us the place in 4e’s cosmology to which the monster is most
closely tied, even if it’s not currently where it lives. Each of the big planes
has its own origin tag. Natural monsters are from the natural world (known as
the “Prime Material” in other editions), Fey monsters from the Feywild, Aberrant
monsters are tied to the Far Realm, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monster type is largely “vibes” based in a way I really like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beasts behave like animals; magical beasts look like animals and behave like
people; humanoids look and behave like people; animates are non-intelligent
things that move because of magic. A giant ant is a natural beast, an elf is a
fey humanoid, a shield guardian is a natural animate, a zombie is a shadow
animate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humanoid doesn’t even mean “two arms and two legs”: centaurs are fey humanoids!
I love this system. In previous readings, I tended to go with Int scores and the
like to guess if a monster was sapient or not, but in this one I’m going mostly
from the classification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;encounter-design&quot;&gt;Encounter Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When designing encounters, the GM decides the encounter’s level (which is
usually from 1 to 35). That and the number of PCs in the party gives them a XP
budget for the encounter. The easiest way to fill this budget is to add a number
of regular monsters equal to the number of PCs, of the same level as the
encounter. Obviously GMs can mix it up by varying monster levels, and adding
minions, elites or solos too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encounter level &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; have to be equal to the party’s level. An “equal
level” encounter is considered a easy-to-moderate difficulty fight. Level-1 or
Level-2 are easy, and anything lower than that is not worth playing out using
the full combat rules. Level+4 or Level+5 are scary nightmare battles where
victory is no longer assured, suitable for final boss fights. Anything harder
than that will dramatically increase the chances of a TPK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encounters don’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be “perfectly balanced”, not anymore than they do in
any other edition. What this system does is deliver &lt;em&gt;consistent&lt;/em&gt; encounters. If
you want them to be easy, they’ll be easy. If you want them to be hard, they’ll
be hard. The number of times where the opposite of what you want happens is kept
to a minimum. And that’s why I love these rules to bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coming-up-next&quot;&gt;Coming up Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from the next post, we’ll get right to the monster entries!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Como Obter e Instalar um e-CPF ou e-CNPJ A3 no Ubuntu Linux em 2025</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Este post é completamente diferente do conteúdo usual do Octopus Carnival, mas
obter a informação aqui foi tão complicado que eu me sinto compelido a deixar
instruções para as gerações futuras (e para mim mesmo, caso eu esqueça). Ele
está em português porque estas instruções são relevantes para quem está no
Brasil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neste artigo, eu vou explicar todos os passos necessários para emitir e instalar
um certificado digital A3 (e-CPF ou e-CNPJ) em uma máquina rodando Ubuntu 22.04
ou 24.04.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O post foi originalmente escrito no meio de 2024, mas até onde eu sei suas
instruções ainda são válidas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background-e-introdução&quot;&gt;Background e Introdução&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pode pular essa sessão inteira se você só quer as instruções. Vá direto aos
Pré-Requisitos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apenas uma raríssima minoria das certificadoras brasileiras sequer apresenta
instruções para emitir um utilizar um certificado A3 em Linux, e essas
instruções são invariavelmente para uma versão mais antiga do Ubuntu, como a
18.04 ou a 20.04. Se você tem uma versão mais recente, como provavelmente é o
caso, você está por conta própria. O propósito deste artigo é remediar isso. Ele
reúne informações de diversas fontes separadas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minha inspiração para escrever este post foi &lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxuniverse.com.br/linux/token-a3&quot;&gt;este outro excelente artigo&lt;/a&gt;
que explica muitas das mesmas coisas. A diferença aqui é que ele usa uma versão
um pouco mais antiga de alguns softwares, com instalação mais complicada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pré-requisitos&quot;&gt;Pré-requisitos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Você precisa de um computador rodando a versão mais atualizada do Ubuntu 22.04
ou 24.04, ou um de seus derivados (como o Pop OS). Os passos a seguir em geral
são válidos para as duas versões, com uma única excessão:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O Assinador SERPRO só pode ser instalado no Ubuntu 22.04 ou derivados!&lt;/strong&gt; A
versão mais recente quando da autoria deste post é a 4.2.1, que depende da
biblioteca &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;libappindicator1&lt;/code&gt;, que por sua vez foi removida do Ubuntu 24.04.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passo-1-adquira-o-token&quot;&gt;Passo 1: Adquira o Token&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escolher um dispositivo físico com bom suporte a Linux costumava ser uma dor de
cabeça sem tamanho, mas isso agora está bem mais fácil: usaremos um token USB do
modelo Safenet eToken 5110.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Se você conhecer uma certificadora que venda certificados A3 em tokens com esse
modelo, pode pular este passo, o passo 3, e o passo 6. Caso contrário,
precisamos de um token vazio para cada certificado que queremos obter. Cada
token guarda apenas um único certificado. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://loja.digitalsecurity.com.br/&quot;&gt;Digital Security do Brasil&lt;/a&gt;
vende tokens vazios, e ela não é a única. Se tiver outra loja de sua confiança,
pode encomendar por lá.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passo-2-instale-o-driver-do-token&quot;&gt;Passo 2: Instale o Driver do Token&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mesmo um token USB ainda precisa de um driver especializado para ser lido. O
eToken 5110 utiliza o Safenet Authentication Client, e foi por isso que eu o
escolhi - ele roda em ambas as versões do Ubuntu visadas por este artigo e tem
uma interface um pouco mais agradável e completa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Precisamos da versão 10.8 do cliente. A maioria dos lugares só tem até a 10.7
para download, mas a GlobalSign tem a 10.8 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalsign.com/en/safenet-drivers/USB/10.8/GlobalSign-SAC-Ubuntu-2204.zip&quot;&gt;aqui&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faça o download (é gratuito e não requer registro), extraia o arquivo zip, e
ache o arquivo chamado &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;safenetauthenticationclient_10.8.1050_amd64.deb&lt;/code&gt; dentro
da estrutura. Instale-o em seu sistema usando os seguintes comandos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;dpkg &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; safenetauthenticationclient_10.8.1050_amd64.deb
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--fix-broken&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O primeiro comando acima instala o pacote; o segundo instala quaisquer
dependências dele que estejam faltando. Todas essas dependências existem nos
repositórios padrão do Ubuntu 22.04 e 24.04.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passo-3-inicialize-o-token&quot;&gt;Passo 3: Inicialize o Token&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cada token deve ter duas senhas associadas a ele. Uma senha “de usuário” (PIN)
que é usada para acessar o conteúdo do token, e uma senha de administração (PUK)
que é usada para modificar as informações dele. Neste passo vamos definir as
duas para o(s) token(s) que você adquiriu no primeiro passo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.locasuporte.com.br/suporte_manuais/safenet/manual_etoken5110.pdf&quot;&gt;Este manual&lt;/a&gt; explica como inicializar um eToken 5110 vazio usando o Safenet
Authentication Client que instalamos no passo anterior. As instruções relevantes
começam na página 11. Lembre-se de anotar as senhas em um local seguro, como um
gerenciador de senhas. Elas não podem ser recuperadas de outra maneira depois de
definidas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O processo basicamente consiste em mudar as senhas de um valor pré-defindo “de
fábrica” para os valores que você deseja. Se você adquiriu o seu token de outra
loja que não a Digital Security, pode ser que a senha default seja outra -
cheque o manual que vier com ele. &lt;strong&gt;Jamais mantenha a senha de fábrica do
token!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passo-4-compre-seu-certificado-a3&quot;&gt;Passo 4: Compre Seu Certificado A3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aqui eu tive uma boa experiência com a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soluti.com.br/&quot;&gt;Soluti&lt;/a&gt; e o &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mafragrupo.com.br/&quot;&gt;Grupo Mafra&lt;/a&gt;. Em
ambos os casos foi necessário falar com o canal de vendas por WhatsApp deles
para especificar que eu precisava de um certificado digital A3 sem mídia. A
Soluti vende e-CPF e e-CNPJ - eles têm loja virtual mas para adquirir sem mídia
ainda é necessário falar com um representante. O Grupo Mafra vende direto por
WhatsApp e representa a certificadora ABS, que no final das contas também emite
certificado pela Soluti - mas o preço deles é bem menor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Em ambos os casos o procedimento foi o mesmo. Após pagar o certificado, marquei
uma videoconferência pelo sistema deles, na qual foi verificada minha identidade
e obti uma &lt;em&gt;senha de emissão e revogação&lt;/em&gt;. No caso da Mafra/ABS, fui direcionado
a uma página onde eu mesmo gerei a senha. No caso da Soluti, eles me passaram a
senha durante a chamada de vídeo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Após o sucesso da chamada, recebi um e-mail com um assunto parecido com
“Solicitação de Certificado Digital aprovada”. No corpo desse e-mail, há um
número de solicitação e um “Usuário de Emissão”. Esse é o nome de usuário que
faz par com a senha obtida na chamada. Precisamos dos dois para os próximos
passos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passo-5-instale-o-java-8&quot;&gt;Passo 5: Instale o Java 8&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sim, é o Java. Sim, é o oito. Vamos precisar dele para rodar o programa que
realiza a emissão dos certificados. Felizmente, não precisa ser o java da
Oracle. Use o seguinte comando:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install &lt;/span&gt;openjdk-8-jdk icedtea-netx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isso instala a mais recente versão do OpenJDK 8, que tem paridade com o da
Oracle para os nossos propósitos. O &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;icedtea-netx&lt;/code&gt; nos dá a funcionalidade do
Java Web Start porque sim, também precisamos disso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Após instalar o JDK, configure seu sistema para que ele seja o
padrão. Precisamos fazer isto de duas maneiras diferentes. A primeira é:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;update-alternatives &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--config&lt;/span&gt; java
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isso vai mostrar um menu com os diferentes executáveis Java no seu
sistema. Mesmo que você não tenha instalado nenhum antes do 8, pode ser que o
sistema tenha instalado o 11 junto. Pressione o número correspondente ao &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;java&lt;/code&gt;
to JDK 8 e depois &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;enter&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depois, use esta sequência de comandos para fazer o Java Web Start entender que
queremos executá-lo com Java 8:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /usr/lib/jvm/
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo rm &lt;/span&gt;default-java
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; java-8-openjdk-amd64 default-java
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passo-6-prepare-para-a-emissão&quot;&gt;Passo 6: Prepare para a Emissão&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Com o Safenet Authentication Client rodando, plugue o seu token vazio no
computador. Tenha à mão a senha PIN gerada no passo 3, e também o usuário e
senha obtidos no passo 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Soluti possui um manual de emissão bem completo &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soluti.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Instalacao-A3.pdf&quot;&gt;aqui&lt;/a&gt;. Note que já fizemos
muito do que está lá: temos o driver certo do nosso token, e a versão correta do
Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seguindo o manual, o próximo passo é baixar o aplicativo emissor &lt;a href=&quot;https://emissor.ca.inf.br/prod/Emissor.jnlp&quot;&gt;aqui&lt;/a&gt;. Você
vai notar que isso é um arquivo de extensão &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jnlp&lt;/code&gt;. É por isso que precisamos do
Java Web Start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Em um terminal, vá ao diretório onde você baixou o arquivo &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Emissor.jnlp&lt;/code&gt; e
execute o seguinte commando:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;javaws Emissor.jnlp
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Você pode a partir daqui seguir o &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.soluti.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Instalacao-A3.pdf&quot;&gt;manual da Soluti&lt;/a&gt;. Como já disse, vai
precisar do nome de usuário e senha do Passo 4 para iniciar a emissão, e a senha
do passo 3 para abrir seu token para a gravação das chaves e certificados.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ao final deste passo, você já tem seu certificado digital emitido! Os próximos
passos deixam seu sistema pronto para &lt;em&gt;usar&lt;/em&gt; o certificado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passo-7-certifique-se-de-que-o-firefox-é-um-pacote-deb&quot;&gt;Passo 7: Certifique-se de que o Firefox é um pacote .deb&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conforme é dito no &lt;a href=&quot;https://linuxuniverse.com.br/linux/token-a3&quot;&gt;post que me inspirou a inscrever este artigo&lt;/a&gt;, a versão
Snap do Firefox, que vem com o Ubuntu, não reconhece o token, porque não tem
acesso às portas USB. Precisamos instalar o browser como um pacote .deb
tradicional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;É possível que você já tenha feito isso por algum outro motivo, ou esteja usando
uma variante que já faz isso como o Pop_OS. Se esse for o caso, pode pular este
passo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caso contrário, adicione o PPA da equipe Mozilla às suas fontes de software:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Em seguida, crie um arquivo chamado &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/etc/preferences.d/mozilla-firefox&lt;/code&gt; com os
seguintes conteúdos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Package: firefox&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
Pin: release &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;LP-PPA-mozillateam
Pin-Priority: 1001

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isso guarante que a versão do PPA tenha precedência sobre o Snap. A seguir,
remova o Snap e instale a versão do PPA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;snap remove firefox

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt remove firefox

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;sudo &lt;/span&gt;apt &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;o=LP-PPA-mozillateam&apos;&lt;/span&gt; firefox
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passo-8-adicione-suporte-ao-token-ao-firefox&quot;&gt;Passo 8: Adicione Suporte ao Token ao Firefox&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vá em “Edit” -&amp;gt; “Settings” e procure por “Security Devices”. Clique o botão que
aparece nos resultados.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na janela que vai aparecer, clique em “NSS Internal PKCS #11 Module”, depois em
“Load” no canto direito da tela. No diálogo que aparecer, dê o nome que quiser
ao módulo e em “Module filename” entre &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/usr/lib/libeToken.so&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O módulo vai carregar e aparecer na lista do canto esquerdo desta mesma
janela. A partir daí você pode plugar seu token, escolher “Log In”, e entrar com
a senha PIN dele para ter acesso ao certificado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Com isso, você já pode usar seu certificado para realizar login em serviços que
o exijam. Ele também permite que procurações sejam assinadas pelo serviço e-CAC
do Ministério da Fazenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passo-9-assinador-serpro&quot;&gt;Passo 9: Assinador SERPRO&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conforme dito na introdução, &lt;strong&gt;o Assinador SERPRO só pode ser instalado em
Ubuntu 22.04 ou derivados&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Se o seu sistema se encaixa nessa categoria, basta seguir o &lt;a href=&quot;https://tutorial.assinadorserpro.estaleiro.serpro.gov.br/html/demo_4.html&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; da
própria SERPRO. Isso vai instalar a versão 4.2.1 do assinador, que é a mais
recente quando da autoria deste post. O Assinador SERPRO é usado para assinar
documentos em PDF ou XML em sua máquina local.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read Hell&apos;s Rebels: Adventure 04, Part 3</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/350px-Hell&apos;s_Rebels_Logo.png&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re firmly in the wrap-up stage now. If you’re here, the PCs have succeeded at
dismantling the powerful magical defenses of the Temple of Asmodeus and
disrupted a dire summoning ritual that was Barzilai Thrune’s last attempt at
squashing the Silver Raven rebellion. They made it out with a literal dragon’s
hoard worth of loot and if they were particularly skilled they might even have
managed to kill Thrune himself during the raid! In this post, we’ll see what all
of that means for the rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;strategic-and-campaign-implications&quot;&gt;Strategic and Campaign Implications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the rebellion is concerned, it has achieved its major goal. All of the
Thrune leadership has been neutralized one way or the other, ceding control of
not just Kintargo but the entire province of Ravounel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few days immediately after the PC’s victory at the temple are a flurry
of activity as the former rebel organization sets itself up as the new
government. If Jilia Bailinus has been rescued and revived (a likely outcome),
then she’s immediately reinstated as Lord Mayor. Otherwise the job goes to a
sympatethic noble or priestly NPC - the players should have some input on who
gets the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new mayor will have several difficult issues to solve in the medium term,
but for now it’s time to celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-silver-span-celebration&quot;&gt;The Silver Span Celebration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the PC’s heroics quickly become common knowledge, now that there is no
more need for secrecy on their part. Soon after they recover from the temple
raid, they and their allies are invited to a huge party in their honor. It takes
place on Bleakbridge - the same spot where the PCs busted a blockade in Part 01
of the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place is quite crowded now. A wooden stage has been erected right in the
middle of the bridge, where a whole bunch of statues are covered with cloth
awaiting for their unveiling. The PCs, every single member of the Silver Ravens,
and anyone else whom they had positive interactions with will be at the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time after the party gets going, the mayor calls the PCs up to the stage,
makes a speech renaming the bridge from Bleakbridge to the Silver Span, and
unveils the statues. These represent all the PCs, plus any NPCs who were
especially important to the rebellion’s success at the group’s discretion. These
are going to be installed along the Silver Span, as an eternal reminder of their
heroic deeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCs themselves are then presented with silver Keys to the City! The keys are
worth quite a bit of money, but the real prize here is the major reputation
boost that comes with being recognized as an official hero. That’s a hefty bonus
to gather information or perform for money in the city, as well as a permanent
10% discount on all Kintargan shops that don’t have reason to actively hate the
characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can close the curtains on this adventure, however, there is the small
matter of the retributive strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-hells-heart&quot;&gt;From Hell’s Heart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… I stab at thee! That’s a particularly appropriate quote here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, right after the PCs receive those keys, the remnants of the Thrune
faction teleport in and try to kill the PCs. I don’t think they can take the
province back at this point - this is simply done out of spite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who the attackers are depend on what exactly happened so far. From the worst
case to the best one, we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barzilai on a Fucking Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;: If both Thrune and the dragon Rivozair are
still alive, they both show up, with Thrune riding the dragon. This happens
even if Rivozair fled the city after being defeated by the PCs in their
previous confrontation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barzilai OR a Fucking Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;: if either one of the pair is dead, the other
still attacks. Rivozair shows up alone; Thrune appears accompanied by four
bone devils.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Dregs&lt;/strong&gt;: If both main baddies are dead, the GM should build a CR 13
encounter with any secondary villains who managed to escape death over the
course of the adventure, focusing on those the players loved to hate the
most. If there are not enough to hit CR 13 on their own, fill the encounter
with appropriate minions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No One!&lt;/strong&gt;: Particularly thorough groups might have not left anyone alive to
attempt revenge! The chance of this happening is quite low, as there are a lot
of named villains here and many of them will make an effort to escape when
first fought. But if this does happen, just skip this battle altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone shows up at all, they fight to the death this time around regardless
of their previous cowardice. This encounter is the “main event”, and it’s
accompanied by a “sideshow” in the form of a bunch of loyalist dottari and minor
devils who arrive more conventionally and try to slaughter the crowd. These keep
the rest of the NPC Silver Ravens occupied, and are handled as series of
Security checks to prevent civilian deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thrune remains as hard to kill as ever, but this time the PCs are fully rested
and have no other encounters to worry about. And with all those NPCs present,
someone is bound to have a handy spell to finish him off if the PCs don’t have
one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;victory-tally&quot;&gt;Victory Tally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this fight is over, we finally get to tally the party’s XP award for
liberating Kintargo. This depends entirely on how many inhabitants have survived
the whole ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city starts the game with 11900 inhabitants, according to its stat sheet in
the Player’s Guide. The GM is supposed to keep track of this number from the
start of the campaign until now. There are several events in the strategic layer
(Thrune reprisals, mostly) that kill a number of innocents and reduce this
number. Deaths of innocents during the “tactical adventuring” portions also
reduce the number - for example, the Ruby Masquerade trap, or if the PCs fail to
rescue a sacrifice victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the city has at least 9000 surviving inhabitants at the end of this last
party, the game considers the rebellion an Unmitigated Success. 7500 or more
survivors makes for a Grim Success, and less than that is a pyrrhic victory
marked by Tragic Loss. I think it’s quite hard to end up with less than 9000
citizens unless the group completely fails to prevent the Ruby Masquerade
massacre and really slacks off during the “hot war” portion of this adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-chelish-crux&quot;&gt;The Chelish Crux&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This device, apparently a Hellraiser-style puzzle box, is also the plot coupon I
mentioned earlier. It sits inside Barzilai Thrune’s chest cavity - he replaced
his heart with it back during adventure 2. The book mentions that retrieving
this thing from Thrune’s corpse and opening it up are vital steps to proceed
with the remaining two adventures in the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concluding-the-adventure-and-what-happens-next&quot;&gt;Concluding the Adventure, and What Happens Next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, nothing &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to happen from this point on. This is an excellent
stopping point for the campaign if the GM doesn’t feel like spending money on
the last two volumes. Just remove the Crux, and say that Barzilai has lost his
chance to become a genius loci by dying. He’s in Hell forever. Campaign
complete, mission accomplished, let’s leave nation-building to the government
and retire as glorious heroes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do want to continue playing Hell’s Rebels, though, then the Crux still
exists and the situation is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kintargo is free for now, and Cheliax is busy fighting the Glorious Reclamation
in its heartland, but that situation won’t last much longer. Cheliax will
eventually send an army to retake the city, which won’t be able to hold against
an all-out military assault. The key to solving that problem happens to be
inside the Chelish Crux, and we’ll deal with that in the next adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barzilai himself isn’t exactly out of the picture either. Even dead, he’s still
on track to become a genius loci, and solving the Cheliax issue will actually
make that process much faster. Dealing with him once and for all is the subject
of the last adventure in the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
