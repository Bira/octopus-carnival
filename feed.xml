        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Slaad</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaads have appeared in every 4e Monster Manual so far. This one gives us more
exotic varieties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic slaad lore remains the same: technically sapient frog-like monsters from
the Elemental Chaos with lolrandom minds and a propensity to implant eggs into
other creatures. You can see the lore specific to each new variety in their
descriptions below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, chaos phage is a level 16 disease that represents being implanted
with a slaad egg. Stage 1 has no effect beyond this, stage 2 gives you a Will
penalty and makes you attack randomly while bloodied, stage 3 means the embryo
bursts out of your skull and kills you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like other diseases it’s not hard to remove with the right ritual, but the
symptoms are severe enough that you’ll want to do it sooner rather than
later. And as usual the ritual takes time and costs a bunch of healing surges,
so it’s something that might add time pressure to a slaad focused adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;golden-slaad&quot;&gt;Golden Slaad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slaads are mostly immune to the chaos storms that often rage through portions of
the Elemental Chaos, which is why they like to follow these storms around. When
one of these storms manages to affect a slaad, it can mutate it into a golden
slaad. Golden Slaads are revered by their chromatic brethren, who follow them
around as if they were a chaos storm themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golden slaads are even more chaos-infused than their relatives, and can inject
that raw chaos in any victims they bite. Their gold-colored forms are unstable,
and if they’re wounded they became unable to sustain those forms, becoming
quivering (but still dangerous!) piles of ooze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures are Huge Elemental Humanoids and Level 20 Controllers with 193
HP. They have a ground speed of 8 and a teleport speed of 6, as well as
low-light vision and an immunity to chaos phage (like all slaads).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; is reach 3 and deals physical damage, with a random rider
depending on the result of the attack roll. If the roll is odd, it slides the
target 3 squares. If it’s even, it dazes them for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also emit &lt;strong&gt;Chaos Croaks&lt;/strong&gt; in a Close Burst 5 (recharge 5+). This
targets Will, does psychic damage, and has a random rider rolled on a d6 table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target is teleported 1d6 squares in a random direction (rolled on a d8).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target makes a melee basic attack against a random creature adjacent to it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target is stunned for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target is slowed (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target takes an extra 10 damage of a random elemental type rolled on a d10.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Target is exposed to chaos phage, and if it was dazed by the slad it becomes
stunned instead (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the slaad is first bloodied it suffers an &lt;strong&gt;Amniotic Transformation&lt;/strong&gt; and
becomes an ooze. It becomes unable to teleport and its speed drops to 4, but it
gains a &lt;strong&gt;Corrosive Pseudopodia&lt;/strong&gt; attack that can be used as an opportunity
action against any adjacent enemy who moves or makes an attack. It deals minor
acid damage and grabs the target on a hit. With a minor action, the slaad can
sustian all of its grabs, deal acid damage to the victims, and regain 5 HP per
grabbed victim. So the loss of speed isn’t that crippling, because the slaad now
&lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; people to get adjacent to it. And it still retains the use of its other
attacks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;putrid-slaad&quot;&gt;Putrid Slaad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an undead slaad. While it’s most often created on purpose by powerful
necromancers, it can also arise naturally when a slaad dies in the Abyss. These
“natural” putrid slaads have a tendency to obey demon lords, so you bet Orcus
loves them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The putrid slaad loses its ability to spread chaos phage, but it still fights
very similarly to a living one. It will even eat its victims. The remains rot
inside its non-functional guts, and then the monster vomits them when it attacks
its &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putrid Slaads are Large Elemental Animates (Undead), and Level 19 Brutes with
227 HP. Its basic &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack pulls the target 1 square, and &lt;strong&gt;Graping
Claws&lt;/strong&gt; allows it to make 2 of those with a single action. If both attacks hit,
the slaad grabs the victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the putrid slaad has grabbed someone, it will hit them with its &lt;strong&gt;Horrific
Spew&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 6), which deals both immediate and ongoing acid and necrotic
damage (save ends). The spew can also be used as a Close Blast 3 attack, but it
has a +2 to-hit bonus when focused on the grabbed victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slaad can also &lt;strong&gt;cast aside&lt;/strong&gt; its grabbed victim, pushing them 5 squares,
dealing some automatic physical damage to the victim, and using it to make an
area attack against anyone adjacent to the victim when it lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-impressions&quot;&gt;Personal Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More slaads. As far as late-edition slaads go, these are pretty cool
mechanically. Golden Slaads finally deliver the promised dose of pure chaos
people expect when they first read the slaad’s basic lore, and putrid slaads
have this cool cycle of grabbing people and tossing them aside, with an
occasional dose of disgusting barf.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Skulk</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skulks first appeared on the AD&amp;amp;D Fiend Folio. This is their 4e debut, with
all-new lore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Centuries ago, the human empire of Bael Turath fought a dreadful war against the
dragonborn empire of Arkhosia. Bael Turath was never a nice place: its society
was severely stratified, and its ruling nobles were slavers that spared little
thought to those they enslaved. When it found itself losing the war against
Arkhosia, those same ruling nobles did not hesitate to turn to Hell for help,
and forged the diabolic pact that would see them and their descendants
transformed into tieflings. We’ve seen all of this before, and we also know that
the pact didn’t help them in the end. Bael Turath fell just the same, with the
pact’s boon at most allowing them to take Arkhosia with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this entry we see one of the reasons why it fell. The pact for infernal power
excluded Bael Turath’s large enslaved population, even as it lowered the
slavers’ guard. There was a huge rebellion where many of Bael Turath’s noble
caste were murdered in their sleep. Some of the rebels did this to escape their
bonds, but some did it because they were angry at being excluded from the
infernal pact. The Demon Prince Graz’zt was impressed with the latter and
reached out to them to offer his patronage. Those who accepted became the
creatures known as skulks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skulks are sapient humanoids with a supernatural affinity for
stealth. Ironically enough, they are much more indebted to their demon patron
than modern-day tieflings are to whatever devil mutated their ancestors. This
eternal debt is encoded in a document known as the &lt;em&gt;Book of the Blinded Eye&lt;/em&gt;,
and it bids even present-day skulks to follow the orders of Graz’zt’s
servants. They’re often sent out as assassins to eliminate threats to the cult
or their demon master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skulks’ hatred of tieflings is equally eternal, and probably also enforced
by the demonic pact. Skulks live as if Bael Turath never fell, and as if they’re
still infiltrated behind enemy lines. Left to their own devices, they will
pursue their original mission of murdering all tieflings. They spread along with
the tiefling diaspora as the latter fled their fallen empire. Any present-day
settlement that contains a sizable tiefling population is also likely to contain
a skulk population preying on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book paints all skulks with this demonic brush, but it would be simple to
say only a small percentage of them are this horrible, just like only a small
percentage of tieflings are diabolists. As with most other humanoid entries, you
can treat this one describing the form skulk &lt;em&gt;villains&lt;/em&gt; usually take, and not as
a species-wide portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine non-evil skulks would simply be reclusive and wish to be left alone,
either living in their own isolated communities or still “infiltrating” those of
others but without trying to murder anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skulks are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 6 and Low-Light
Vision. Their signature trait is Stealthy Step, which exempts them from the
Stealth penalty for moving more than 2 squares per turn or for running. All of
the individual entries have additional stealth powers beyond that, appropriate
to their role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entries here are appropriate threats for an early-to-mid-Heroic party. More
powerful skulks up to epic tier certainly exist, but are left as an exercise to
the GM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skulk-mesmerist&quot;&gt;Skulk Mesmerist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spellcaster specializing in charm and illusion magic. It’s a Level 3
Controller with 45 HP. Mesmerists fight with a &lt;strong&gt;short sword&lt;/strong&gt; and have a couple
of active attack powers. The first is &lt;strong&gt;Luring Charm&lt;/strong&gt;, a non-damaging ranged
attack that targets Will, slides the target 4 squares, and dazes then for a
turn. The other is &lt;strong&gt;Mesmerize&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) a ranged attack that targets
Will, deals psychic damage, and makes the target unable to see any enemies other
than the mesmerist themselves (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, they can also use &lt;strong&gt;Deceptive Veil&lt;/strong&gt; to look like any Medium
or Small humanoid. Piercing the illusion requires a DC 26 Insight check, which
is very hard even for a dedicated PC at this level. This is actually more
powerful than the Changeling’s disguise ability, since it also allows the
mesmerist to look like a Small humanoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skulk Mesmerists like to kill two birds with one stone by murdering a target
while looking like someone they want to frame for that murder. Their Veil also
makes it possible for the GM to make an adventure where an innocent changeling
is charged for a string of murders perpetrated by a skulk mesmerist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skulk-murderer&quot;&gt;Skulk Murderer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one does what it says on the tin. Over and over and over. It’s a Level 3
Lurker with 37 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the standard Stealthy Step trait, the murderer also has &lt;strong&gt;Peerless
Camouflage&lt;/strong&gt; that allows it to hide while it only has partial cover or
concealment, and to remain hidden if it still has cover or concealment at the
end of a movement. It also has &lt;strong&gt;Unseen Strike&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets it deal extra
damage against targets that couldn’t see at the start of its turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The murderer fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Short sword&lt;/strong&gt; and can thrown a &lt;strong&gt;Shuriken Volley&lt;/strong&gt;
once per encounter. This lets it make three ranged attacks, which deal a bit of
damage and immobilize (save ends) on a hit. All of these can benefit from Unseen
Strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When playing one of these, you want to start the fight hidden and open it with a
Shuriken Volley. Then you alternate between re-establishing stealth and striking
with the sword. A mesmerist in the same team as the murder makes it a lot more
dangerous, because now the murderer doesn’t need to waste time hiding to benefit
from Unseen Strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;skulk-hunter&quot;&gt;Skulk Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another stealthy killer, but this one is a Level 5 Soldier with 61 HP. It fights
with a longsword, and even its basic attack is funny: it’s called &lt;strong&gt;Baffling
Blade&lt;/strong&gt;, and it if hits it allows the hunter to stay hidden from the target. Its
special attack is the &lt;strong&gt;Invisible Blade&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), which targets someone
who can’t see the hunter, deals double damage, and inflicts ongoing 5 damage
(save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both attacks mark the target as an effect, and if an enemy marked by the hunter
shifts the hunter gets to use Baffling Blade against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunters also go very well with mesmerists: the mesmerist can make them invisible
to a PC while they set up as the traditional front line preventing the PC from
reaching the mesmerist. They can use Invisible Blade against the afflicted
victim without having to hide, and they can also hide without having to leave
formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in the lore entry, I like this entry much better if I read it as
describing the typical skulk &lt;em&gt;villain&lt;/em&gt; instead of describing the typical
&lt;em&gt;skulk&lt;/em&gt;. Mechanically, I like how the three stat blocks synergize - they’re
clearly meant to be used together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allied monsters might include Graz’zt cultists and minor demons. Anything that
can make their monster buddies invisible also works really well with skulks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Shardmind</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shardminds made their debut as a playable option in the Player’s Handbook 3 for
4e. They’re new to this edition and really lean into its background lore for
psionics. They also have the honor of being the second living construct species
presented in the game (after Warforged). This entry presents some shardmind stat
blocks for use as NPCs or enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the dawn of time there was a crystaline entity named the Living Gate. Neither
god nor primordial, the Gate protected the border between the known planes and
the Far Realm. It stood firm even during the Dawn War, but it was eventually
sundered by the combined efforts of mind flayers, beholders and other Far Realm
inhabitants who wanted to enter the world for reasons ranging from the
inscrutable to the foul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Living Gate was shattered and its pieces spread through the cosmos,
its will lived on, gifting the disparate shards with life and purpose. These are
the shardminds, living constructs with a strong affinity for psionic power and
ancestral memories that compel them to rebuild the Living Gate and once again
seal the Far Realm away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite that common ancestral memory shardminds as individuals are as varied in
outlook and personality as any other sapient species. Over the ages they have
formed three major schools of thought that propose different ways of continuing
the mission of the Living Gate. The MM3 doesn’t describe all of them, but I will
because they’re cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Thought Builders&lt;/strong&gt; believe the correct solution is to build a new Living
Gate and imbue it with the psionic power necessary to seal the Far Realm. Their
main goal is to acquire the knowledge necessary to do so. They tend to be Good
and worship Ioun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The God Shards&lt;/strong&gt; believe that the Shardminds now form a distributed network
that carries on the duties of the Living Gate. It’s each individual’s duty to
train and nurture their own power so that they can better contribute to this
task. Once this network is strong enough, the Far Realm will be sealed. They
tend to be Unaligned and worship no gods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Shard Slayers&lt;/strong&gt; are the faction most likely to come into conflict with the
PCs. They believe that the original Living Gate can rebuild itself if it’s
psionic energy is allowed to return to its original site. However, this energy
is “trapped” in the shardminds, and must be forcibly “released”. So yeah,
adherents of this philosophy want to kill all other shardminds and then
themselves. They are usually Evil and worship Vecna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stat blocks in this entry represent Shard Slayers suitable as mid-to-late
Heroic opposition. If your group has one or more shardminds, they have a
built-in reason to be hostile. Even if it doesn’t, most non-Evil PCs will be
interested in stopping a bunch of genocidal maniacs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shardminds are Immortal Humanoids with the Living Construct keyword. They have
Resist 5 Psychic and a ground speed of 6. Their signature power is the same one
PCs get: &lt;strong&gt;Shardswarm&lt;/strong&gt;, an encounter power which allows them to break apart and
reform a short distance away. This causes every adjacent enemy to grant combat
advantage for a turn and lets the shardmind teleport half their speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shardminds speak Common, Deep Speech, and have telepathy with range 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shardmind-warseeker&quot;&gt;Shardmind Warseeker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-shardmind-jasper.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This psychic warrior disguises its true nature beneath a suit of plate, and
wanders about seeking shardminds to slay. Its outwardly calm demeanor hides a
murderous rage, which reveals itself when it’s wounded in combat or when an
innocent bystander fails to answer its questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warseeker is a Level 6 Soldier with 70 HP. It wears plate and fights with a
broadsword and a heavy crossbow. Heavy armor means its speed is only 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;crossbow&lt;/strong&gt; are basic attacks that damage and mark
for a turn. If a marked enemy within 5 squares of the warseeker targets makes an
attack that doesn’t target it, the warseeker can deal 5 psychic damage to that
enemy. Once the warseeker is bloodied, its &lt;strong&gt;Furious Mind&lt;/strong&gt; grants it 10
temporary HP, a -2 penalty to AC, and a +4 bonus to damage for the rest of the
fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a basic frontline fighter with some tricks borrowed from the paladin and
the barbarian. It’s sticky and a good choice to form a solid “wall” with other
soldiers and brutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shardmind-dominator&quot;&gt;Shardmind Dominator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A psion who is a big fan of mind control. It’s a Level 8 Controller with 86
HP. It wields a &lt;strong&gt;dagger&lt;/strong&gt; as a basic melee attack, but the important bits are
its powers geared towards brute-force mind control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overwhelming Mind&lt;/strong&gt; is an at-will power that only has an “Effect” line,
meaning this always happens: it forces an enemy within 5 squares to make a melee
or ranged basic attack against a target of the dominator’s choice. If the attack
hits, the dominator slides the enemy 3 squares. &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Puppet&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+)
is a non-damaging ranged attck that dominates the target on a hit (save
ends). And &lt;strong&gt;Mind Swarm&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) is an area attack that deals psychic
damage and creates a zone that lasts the rest of the encounter. Enemies who end
their turn inside can be slid 3 squares by the dominator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dominators will be doing little damage on their own, but they’ll cause lots of
friendly fire incidents and will make it very hard for the party to maintain any
sort of coherent formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shardmind-executioner&quot;&gt;Shardmind Executioner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A skilled assassin dispatched to murder shardminds identified by its
buddies. It’s a Level 10 Lurker with 81 HP, wielding a crystal greatsword called
a &lt;strong&gt;Shardblade&lt;/strong&gt;. It does standard damage for its level, which can be increased
by the &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Boost&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+). This is a free-action power that
triggers when the executioner hits with the sword, so it’s never wasted on a
missed attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The executioner attacks a range with a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; power, which deals light
psychic damage and blinds the target for a turn. It can also perform a &lt;strong&gt;Psychic
Infiltration&lt;/strong&gt;, a melee attack vs. Will. On a hit this removes the executioner
from play and causes the target to suffer 20 ongoing psychic damage and be dazed
(save ends). When the target saves, the executioner appears adjacent to it. This
is an at-will power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A boosted sword strike actually deals more damage than a round of Infiltration,
but the latter is an excellent move to use while Psychic Boost recharges, as it
shields the shardmind from damage. So this lurker actually hides inside the
enemy’s minds, and deals massive damage while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love all the living constructs, and shardminds are no exception. Their default
appearance is a bit meh, but as you can see by the illustrations I chose here
this can be easily remedied.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadows have been in the game since the beginning. They were usually undead in
previous editions, but here they get a bit of new lore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s understandable that someone would think shadows are undead, but the truth
is that they are a species of creature native to the Shadowfell. They’re
sapient but they perceive the world in a way that makes then inimical to most
other living creatures. They hate light, and believe the shadows cast by living
creatures to be prisoners in cages of flesh. Many seek to rescue these prisoners
by destroying their cages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadows might form alliances of convenience with other people that would offer
them the chance to “liberate” lots of living creatures, but they rarely care for
the causes or gods of us fleshlings. The exception seems to be spellcasters
versed in shadow magic, who can summon them very easily and always find them to
be obsequious and eager servants. It’s almost like the shadows know something
that these mortal masters don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadows slip into the world via these summonings or at natural contact points
between the world and the Shadowfell. Their number has increased in recent
years, but no one knows why yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadows are Medium Shadow Humanoids with a ground speed of 8 and
Darkvision. They’re insubstantial but vulnerable to radiant damage. Exposure to
ambient light doesn’t damage them, but reveals their position and leaves them
with less places to hide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their signature trait is &lt;strong&gt;Born of Shadows&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows them to make Stealth
checks to hide mid-combat when they have any amount of concealment, instead of
needing total concealment. All of the variants here are trained in Stealth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shadow-stalker&quot;&gt;Shadow Stalker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is equivalent to the classic shadows of editions past. It’s a Level 3
Lurker with 25 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stalker attacks with a &lt;strong&gt;shadowy touch&lt;/strong&gt; that does necrotic damage, and it
has a &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Stalk&lt;/strong&gt; power that deals necrotic damage and allows it to meld
with an enemy’s shadow (save ends). While melded, the shadow moves in lockstep
with its victim, without provoking opportunity attacks. It gains a +4 to all
defenses and a +5 to attack the victim. When the victim saves, the shadow
appears on an adjacent square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its triggered action is &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Step&lt;/strong&gt;: when a nearby creature drops to 0 HP,
the stalked teleports to an adjacent square and gains a +2 bonus to attacks for
a turn (from eating the victim’s shadow). This also recharges Shadow Stalk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow Stalkers become major threats if they manage to land their Shadow Stalk
attack. Its buddies should focus fire on the stricken PC, which increases the
chances of the PC dropping to 0 HP and recharging the power. Note that it’s
possible for multiple stalkers to meld with the same PC’s shadow, and that the
attack also recharges if an &lt;em&gt;enemy&lt;/em&gt; hits 0 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs should focus their fire on any shadow stalkers in Team Monster, preferrably
with radiant and force attacks to kill them quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shadow-strangler&quot;&gt;Shadow Strangler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a spellcaster specializing in remote shadow control. It uses the shadows
it devours to fuel its magic, so it must feed more frequently than its
fellows. Stranglers are Level 9 Artillery with 53 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strangler’s &lt;strong&gt;shadowy touch&lt;/strong&gt; deals necrotic damage and makes invisible to
the target for a turn. Its basic ranged attack is a spell namd &lt;strong&gt;Blinding
Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; that deals the same amount of necrotic damage and makes the target
unable to see further than 3 squares for a turn. Its special attack is
&lt;strong&gt;Strangling Darkness&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) which restrains and deals ongoing 15
damage (save ends). And finally it has an encounter power named &lt;strong&gt;Devouring
Dark&lt;/strong&gt; that’s basically a “shadow fireball” that deals light necrotic damage and
blinds everyone it hits for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being artillery, stranglers are very controllery. They pair well with
lurkers whose increased damage depends on combat advantage or on being unseen by
their targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shadow-puppeteer&quot;&gt;Shadow Puppeteer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This powerful shadow has a more refined palate. It seeks to feed on the shadows
cast by souls as they depart for the afterlife. So while the others might leave
their victims a bit drained but alive, this one is definitely out for murder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppeteers are Level 14 Lurkers with 74 HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;shadowy touch&lt;/strong&gt; deals extra
damage against targets that cannot see it, and creates a zone of lightly
obscured squares centered on the target’s space that lasts for a turn. Its
special attak is &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Puppet&lt;/strong&gt;, which targets a creature that cannot see the
puppeteer, deals light necrotic damage, and dominates them until they start
their turn not adjacent to the shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puppeteers and stranglers have amazing synergy. If you want your PCs to sweat
for their victory, it’s definitely worth it to adjust their levels so they’re
closer to each other and can be included in the same encounter. Keep the
strangler as the lower-level half of the pair to make things slightly less hard
for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs fighting a puppeteer should remain mobile to avoid lingering in the darkness
it creates, and should use forced movement powers to keep it away from potential
domination targets. If they face the tag team described above, they should focus
on killing the strangler first, since it frees the puppeteer from having to set
up its lurker bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadows don’t usually work well with other monsters, so you’re most likely
looking at all-shadow teams when building encounters. If you want more variety
it might be possible to turn another monster into a shadow by changing its
origin, halving its HP, making it insubstantial, and making its basic attack
into a touch that targets Reflex and deals necrotic damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original reason shadows were scary was that they drained Strength, but here
they’re scary because they’re &lt;em&gt;sticky&lt;/em&gt;. The basic stalker can enter your shadow
and attack you from there until it kills you. The puppetter does the same but
dominates you to attack your friends while it’s doing it. And the strangler
makes it a lot easier for the other two to do their part.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Secret of Vecna</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;(The book has an illustrated Secret of Vecna. I did not include the image here
because it’s gross.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first saw a stat block for these in Thunderspire Labyrinth, the second
heroic-tier module published for 4e. They appear here in revised form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vecna is an ascended lich, the evil god of secrets and magic. He teaches that
secret knowledge is the path to power, encouraging and rewarding his followers
to learn all they can by whatever means necessary. He also punishes his
followers for willingly &lt;em&gt;sharing&lt;/em&gt; these secrets, an act that is anathema to
him. The most common punishment is to transform the heretic into a Secret of
Vecna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures resemble bald humans with plain features, usually wearing robes
and wielding daggers or staffs. When they get seriously wounded, their skin
sloughs off and they turn into an horrific living ghoul with wickedly sharp
fangs and claws. Secrets lack any will of their own, living to do the bidding of
their divine patron. They get sent to guard sites important to Vecna, or to aid
the plans of his priests. A Secret’s ultimate aim is always to advance Vecna’s
goals, though, even to the detriment of his followers. Smart followers know
never to trust a Secret completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legend says there is a ritual capable of mending a Secret and turning them back
into the person they used to be. This could be done for altruistic reasons, or
as a means of getting access to the information that person knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secrets are Medium Natural Humanoids with a speed of 6. They are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; undead
and have no special resistances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their signature ability is &lt;strong&gt;Horrific Visage&lt;/strong&gt;, which triggers as soon as
they’re bloodied. It works as a Close Burst 3 attack vs. Will. On a hit it does
light psychic damage and pushes the target 3 squares. This is the transformation
into a ghoul-like horror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the monster’s abilities can only be used before it transforms, while
others can only be used afterwards. So in practice each Secret has two distinct
attack profiles. The human one is usually some degree of tricksy, while the
“monster” one is simpler but stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enigma-of-vecna&quot;&gt;Enigma of Vecna&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A spellcaster who grew too greedy and offered to sell or barter the secrets they
learned in service to Vecna. They retain some of their magic, and gain the
ability to temporarily strip a victim of its memories. They’re Level 6
Controllers with 68 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When human, they fight with &lt;strong&gt;daggers&lt;/strong&gt; and magic. &lt;strong&gt;Shock Bolt&lt;/strong&gt; is a ranged
attack that targets Reflex and does lightning damage, also slowing the target
for a turn. And &lt;strong&gt;Memory Ripper&lt;/strong&gt; is another ranged attack targetting Will and
doing light psychic damage with an awesome rider. Targets hit by this spell are
prevented from using encounter or daily attack powers, and any utility powers
(save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Enigma is bloodied, &lt;strong&gt;Horrific Visage&lt;/strong&gt; triggers and it transforms
into a straightforward melee combatant. Its only attack from that point on is
&lt;strong&gt;Rend Flesh&lt;/strong&gt;, which does heavy physical damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;spell-howler-of-vecna&quot;&gt;Spell Howler of Vecna&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a more powerful caster who failed Vecna in some way. Maybe they failed
on a mission given to them by the god, or failed to share a secret with Vecna
after discovering it. Or maybe they just dug too deep and looked into matters
forbidden to one of their rank. They’re Level 18 Artillery with 130 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spell Howlers are powerful enough to not need weapons. Their basic attack is a
&lt;strong&gt;Maddening Touch&lt;/strong&gt; that deals psychic damage. Their basic ranged attack is a
&lt;strong&gt;Word of Force&lt;/strong&gt; that targets Fortitude and does force damage. They can use a
&lt;strong&gt;Word of Madness&lt;/strong&gt; to deal psychic damage, slide the target 3 squares and have
it make a free attack against another target of the howler’s choice. This
recharges on a miss, so they can keep trying it. And finally they can say a
&lt;strong&gt;Word of Pain&lt;/strong&gt; once per encounter to deal heavy necrotic damage to a target,
half on a miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this stops after the transformation. Maddening Touch remains an option,
but their only ranged attack is now the &lt;strong&gt;Word of Doom&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals psychic
damage and dazes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;secret-of-vecna&quot;&gt;Secret of Vecna&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The titular monster of the entry used to be a high priest of Vecna who allowed
some of the god’s secrets to fall into the hands of a non-believer. Vecna
appears to them personally to shatter their minds and transform their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secrets are Level 19 Skirmishers with 176 HP. Faster than average, they have a
Speed of 8 and a Teleport speed of 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In human form, they use a &lt;strong&gt;Cloak of Ignorance&lt;/strong&gt; spell that covers a Close Burst
3, deals psychic damage, and makes them invisible to the target (save
ends). Then they move in with &lt;strong&gt;Shocking Grasp&lt;/strong&gt;, a basic attack that deals
lightning damage and has a big damage bonus when the target can’t see the
monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After transforming, their only attack is &lt;strong&gt;Thundering Claws&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals heavy
thunder damage, knocks prone, and slides 1 square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the sort of odd monster that you can typically find in Monster
Manuals numbered 3 or above. Fortunately they had enough space for a nicely
evocative bit of lore. Their mechanics are an interesting take on the
“two-stage” monster, and a different one from both the MM2’s Phoeras and Fey
Lingerers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the lore mentions, these are Vecna’s specialty divine servitors, so they’ll
be found wherever the god’s cultists and temples are.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of scary animated scarecrows is a classic, so I’m sure they popped
up in earlier editions. This is their 4e debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarecrows in the middle world are straw mannequins placed on fields to keep
birds away. Scarecrows in the Feywild are terrifying constructs built to keep
&lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; away, and to tear them to pieces if they get too close. Both look the
same, so never forget which plane you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first animated scarecrows were created by a hag with straw stolen from a
farmer at the stroke of midnight, clothes from a freshly slain corpse, and
thread made from the hair of a nightmare. The idea spread quickly, and now lots
of different people use them. I imagine the recipes used by less evil creators
are not as macabre, though the construction of a scarecrow still involves a lot
of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarecrows are a bit less sturdy than golems, but they’re much smarter. They can
understand more complex instructions and have a link to their master that allows
for long-distance, two-way communication. When a scarecrow spots an intruder, it
transmits what it sees to its master. They’re alarm and surveillance systems in
addition to being guardians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the master dies, any surviving scarecrows will keep following their last
orders. This means you could find an ancient ruin guarded by masterless
scarecrows in the Feywild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scarecrows are Medium Fey Animates (Constructs). They’re immune to disease,
poison and sleep, though non-minion variants are also vulnerable 10 to
fire. They have low-light vision and a speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scarecrow-shambler&quot;&gt;Scarecrow Shambler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proper scarecrow takes months of careful work, with each stitch and each bit
of straw placed precisely in the configuration that will allow it to hold the
most magic reinforcement and power. A skilled enough ritual caster, however, can
cut a bunch of corners and and produce a small army of these crude models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shamblers are not much tougher than a mundane scarecrow, as their magic barely
holds them together. They are still strong enough to kill someone with their
bare hands, and are filled with toxic mold that spreads through the air when
they are destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures are Level 10 Minion Brutes. Their basic attack is &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; that
does physical damage with no special riders. When destroyed, they disintegrate
in a puff of moldy straw, creating a zone in a Close Burst 1 that lasts until
the end of the encounter. The zone is a poison cloud: it’s lightly obscured and
deals 10 poison damage to anyone who starts their turn inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, shamblers are meant to die en masse and blanket the battlefield in a
giant poison cloud. An ignorant wizard might inadvertently help them along by
popping an entire group with an area attack. I guess they still act as cameras
for their master too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scarecrow-guardian&quot;&gt;Scarecrow Guardian&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “baseline” model discussed in the lore section, painstakingly crafted to act
as a guardian. They’re Level 13 Soldiers with 107 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardians fight with their &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt;, which damage and mark on a hit. They also
have a couple of gaze attacks: &lt;strong&gt;Luring Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (at-will) is a ranged attack that
deals psychic damage and pulls the target 5 squares; and &lt;strong&gt;Horrid Gaze&lt;/strong&gt;
(minor action, encounter) is a Close Blast 3 that deals no damage and
immobilizes for a turn. These are tailored to allow the monster to prevent
intruders from escaping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re also deceptively hard to kill - the &lt;strong&gt;Malleable Straw&lt;/strong&gt; interrupt kicks
in when they’re damaged, and causes them to take half damage from the
attack. Since it’s an interrupt, it only works once per round, but still makes
them more durable than their HP would indicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scarecrow-haunter&quot;&gt;Scarecrow Haunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haunters are created by adding an extra ingredient to the original scarecrow
recipe: the heart of someone who was killed by another scarecrow. It gets sewn
into the construct’s body, from which it irradiates the fear its former owner
felt before dying. The haunter twists this raw emotion into frightening
illusions when hunting down intruders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haunters are Level 13 Lurkers with 99 HP. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; and have
several interesting special attacks. The first one we must mention is the
&lt;strong&gt;Lurking Horror&lt;/strong&gt; passive trait. It makes it so all of their attacks deal 5
extra damage and have their forced movement increased by 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As lurkers, haunters can begin harrassing the party from a distance, while
safely hidden. &lt;strong&gt;Haunting Echoes&lt;/strong&gt; an area burst 2 within 10 attack that targets
the Will of all enemies inside. A hit slides the target 2 squares and forces
them to make a basic attack against a creature of the haunter’s choice as they
try to fight the imaginary ghosts conjured within their minds. With Lurking
Horror, this slide could be as large as 4 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once spotted, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Terrifying Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) as a minor action
to keep the PCs at bay. This is a Close Blast 3 that targets Will, deals light
psychic damage, and pushes 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their “hiding” ability is &lt;strong&gt;Fluttering Straw&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows them to seemingly
burst into a cloud of rotten straw and rags while teleporting 6 squares and
becoming invisible and insubstantial for a turn. They’ll use it to avoid being
surrounded and to resume their stealthy “grenading” with Haunting Echoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite interesting! Animated scarecrows are always good for a bit of scary fun,
and these don’t disappoint. I like the contrast with golems: the creation of a
D&amp;amp;D golem is described like a highly technical process that involves trapping
elemental spirits. The creation of a scarecrow is the telling of a scary fairy
tale, relying on the inherent narrative power of its ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you choose to make less evil scarecrow recipes a thing in your setting,
they’re probably the domain of hags, lamias and other paragon-tier evil fey. A
particularly ancient hag is going to have a small army of Guardians and Haunters
protecting her territory, and the realization that each of these represents at
least one of her previous victims will add to the horror of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want your Heroic-tier players to meet scarecrows without having to trek
to the Feywild, I would suggest statting the Shambler as a Level 3 Regular, and
knocking the other two down to level 6 or so.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Rot Grub</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rog grubs have been around more or less since the beginning, though they used to
be more of a trap than a monster in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rot grubs are voracious parasites with a life cycle so accelerated some scholars
think they’re a divine curse sent by Torog to inflict suffering upon the
world. They burrow into the bodies of larger creatures, eating their flesh and
laying eggs inside. They don’t care if the body in question is alive or dead,
either. A living being infested by a swarm of rot grubs will experience
indescribable agony as they’re eaten alive, and this lasts until the grubs reach
the heart and kill the host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rot grub infestations usually happen in underground dungeons, since they like
the dark and humidity. Sapient creatures that like the same environments quickly
learn to watch out for rot grubs, since an infestation can depopulate their
homes in short order. Some, like orcs, just pull up stakes and move elsewhere
when they find rot grubs. Others try to find uses for them. Kobolds stick them
inside clay pots for use as special sling ammunition. Bugbears use them to
enhance pit traps. Gnolls use them as instruments of torture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These infestations tend to burn themselves out as the rot grubs eat through all
available victims in the area and then die from starvation. Only a few hardy
individuals remain, possibly in hibernation, waiting for the next unwary victim
to approach their corpse host.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are, however legends of entire &lt;em&gt;oceans&lt;/em&gt; of these horrible little things
undulating in the depths of the underdark. Supposedly, they sustain themselves
by feeding on the flesh of a dead god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rot Grubs are Natural Beasts, and a swarm large enough to count as a monster is
Medium in size. These swarms have Speed 5 and Darkvision, so they’re far from
the stationary hazards of earlier editions. If a swarm notices you, it’s going
to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rot-grub-swarm&quot;&gt;Rot Grub Swarm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic model. After killing their first few victims, they retreat inside the
bodies and lay up to ten thousand eggs. These hatch into new swarms after a
month or so. This is the classic “trap” scenario from earlier editions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This swarm is a Level 4 Brute with 63 HP. It has the common traits mentioned
above, and the usual Swarm traits: half damage and no forced movement from
single-target attacks, vulnerable 10 to area attacks, can occupy the same space
as other creatures and squeeze into any space big enough for a single grub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also a &lt;strong&gt;Clumsy Attacker&lt;/strong&gt;, which means it lacks a basic melee attack. It
still has an attack ability, but it’s not considered “basic”. This means the
swarm can’t charge or make opportunity attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;strong&gt;Swarm Aura&lt;/strong&gt; has a size of 1 and deals 5 damage to any enemy that stars
its turn inside. This damage increases by 2 for each extra swarm whose aura
overlaps the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swarm attacks with &lt;strong&gt;Infesting Bites&lt;/strong&gt;, which deal no immediate damage but
inflict ongoing 5 damage on a hit (save ends). This worsens to 10 after the
first failed save, and to 15 after the second. An unlucky level-appropriate
adventurer will find themselves dead from this about as fast as a PC from the
olden days. Save-boosting powers and items are a wise investment here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rot-grub-zombies&quot;&gt;Rot Grub Zombies&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even grub-infested corpses are a little more active than they used to be! This
is such a horrible death that it’s not uncommon for the victim to rise as a
zombie soon afterwards. These zombies are on the faster side, and some speculate
they’re controlled by the swarm inside them, since they are drawn to victims
with open wounds that make it easy for the grubs to leap into their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zombie is a Level 8 Skirmisher with 86 HP and Speed 6. Its basic attack is a
&lt;strong&gt;slam&lt;/strong&gt;, and it can also execute a &lt;strong&gt;flailing slam&lt;/strong&gt; that allows it to shift 1
square before or after the attack. Their special attack is &lt;strong&gt;Rot Grub Hunger&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 5+), which targets a bloodied enemy and deals slam damage plus 2d6
necrotic damage. Hit or miss, it also exposes the target to rot grub
infestation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the zombie hits 0 HP, &lt;strong&gt;Corpse Collapse&lt;/strong&gt; kicks in and spawns a rot grub
swarm in its space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rot Grub Infestation&lt;/strong&gt; is a level 4 disease with an improve DC of 18 and a
Maintain DC of 12. This makes it a slower version of the infestation implied by
the basic swarm. Stage 1 eats a healing surge and makes the patient vulnerable 5
to necrotic damage. Stage 2 eats a second healing surge and inflicts a -4
penalty to all skill rolls. Stage 3 kills the victim and immediately turns them
into a rot grub zombie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you dislike the way D&amp;amp;D 4 implements disease, you could replace the exposure
effect and bonus necrotic damage of Rot Grub Hunger with the increasing ongoing
damage from the basic swarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;awakened-rot-grub-swarm&quot;&gt;Awakened Rot Grub Swarm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is a swarm that ate something very psionic, maybe it’s a duergar
bioweapon run amok… whatever its origins, this is a rot grub swarm that became
sapient. Its telepathic hive mind emits constant chatter with affirming phrases
such as “Without us, within them, reap their flesh”. Sometimes bits and pieces
of its victim’s minds also contribute to the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awakened swarm is mostly identical to the basic one, but it’s a Level 10
Brute with 123 HP. All the numbers go up, including aura damage and the ongoing
damage inflicted by their attack. They also get a couple of extra psychic
powers. &lt;strong&gt;Psychic Shock&lt;/strong&gt; is a Close Burst 2 that deals no damage but
immobilizes for a turn on a hit. And &lt;strong&gt;Telepathic Lure&lt;/strong&gt; is a ranged attack
(minor action, 1/round) that pulls a target 4 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course this swarm is &lt;em&gt;sapient&lt;/em&gt;, with Int 8, which is plenty to allow it
to set up ambushes or even make conscious alliances with other beings it can’t
eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ewwww. Early D&amp;amp;D modules loved using rot grubs as a sort of lethal trap hidden
inside corpses found in the dungeon, usually those of previous adventurers. It
was not uncommon to also place some enticing loot on these corpses. They can
still be used in this role here, and while they’re not as instantly lethal as
their older versions, they’re still quite dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Ogrémoch</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-ogr%C3%A9moch.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogrémoch is another of the Princes of Elemental Evil, and first appeared
alongside Imix in the Fiend Folio for AD&amp;amp;D 1e. He is the second, but not the
last, epic campaign end boss to make an appearance on the MM3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning there was substance without form, the roiling indistinct mass
of the purest Elemental Chaos. From that mass the eldest primordials arose
spontaneously, and they in turn used their powers to create others. Eventually
this big family decided to get together and create the middle world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogrémoch is one of these eldest Primordials. He witnessed the dawn of time, and
the rise and fall of his children as they built the world and warred with the
gods. Ogrémoch was among the primordials contacted by the Elder Elemental Eye,
and like the other Princes he became convinced the Eye was the very first
primordial. Concerned about the gods’ growing influence on the world, he decided
to join the Dawn War in concert with the other Princes. Despite their atypical
level of teamwork, they lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Imix, Ogrémoch did not escape the gods. He was captured and chained to
his own realm by Moradin. Though he cannot leave, he can still influence the
world through his many cults. His goals are to free both himself and the Elder
Elemental Eye, and to finish what he started during the Dawn War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His greater age and more stable element make Ogrémoch a more patient and wise
Primordial than Imix. Where Imix is a cowardly hothead, Ogrémoch is a cryptic
miser. As the Primordial of Earth, he rules over everything that is hidden
underground, from metal and gem deposits to caves, ruins, and the treasures
buried inside them. Ogrémoch knows many secrets that give one power over the
earth and its hidden bounty, but he’s jealous of them and only gives them up
reluctantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes a lot of time and patience for his cultists to earn enough favor to
learn those secrets, so earth magic is rarer among them than you would
expect. It’s no unusual for a cult leader to have to rely on hired muscle to
reinforce the security of their hidden shrines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many independent cults to Ogrémoch spread throughout the world, and
though the details of their beliefs and practices may differ, they’re all
structured like mystery cults. They thrive on the rustic fringes of “civilized”
lands, tricking the innocent and ignorant into believing Ogrémoch is a
benevolent power of the earth. By the time these unfortunates learn the truth,
it’s too late to escape the cult’s grasp. More rarely, they attract more
well-informed people who seek an alternative to the gods. While there are
several deities who preside over the same concepts as the primordial, these
recruits probably reason that, as the older being, Ogrémoch has more of a claim
to these domains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the highest levels of initiation, the differences between the many cults fall
away, and the existence of the Elder Elemental Eye is revealed. These
high-ranking cultists serve Ogrémoch and the Eye in equal measure, and out of
all of the elemental cults they’re the most willing to genuinely cooperate in
freeing their masters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll start by looking at the cultists, and finish with the stats for Ogrémoch
himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The various cultist stat blocks represent people of various species that managed
to gain power from their worship. As with Imix cultists, there aren’t enough of
them to build encounter groups - they’re meant to be added to groups of other
humanoids or monsters representing hired muscle or “unpowered” cultists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any earth-elemental creature might be associated with a cult of Ogrémoch,
including hill and earth giants. Underground dwellers like grimlocks and
troglodytes are also frequently drawn to his service, as are “giantish” people
like ogres or ettins. And of course, any “generic” humanoid stat block can be
lightly reskinned as a cultist as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;earth-cultist&quot;&gt;Earth Cultist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are common servitors, largely ignorant of the deeper mysteries, serving
because they know nothing else. They’re Level 8 Minion Controllers wearing
leather and wielding &lt;strong&gt;warhammers&lt;/strong&gt;. The scrap of primordial power within then
explodes in a &lt;strong&gt;Petrifying Font&lt;/strong&gt; when they drop to 0 HP: it automatically hits
every enemy adjacent to the cultist and slows them (save ends). After the first
failed save, this worsens to &lt;em&gt;petrified&lt;/em&gt; (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yikes! These poor souls are unwitting time bombs, and quite dangerous for
minions. Evil GMs would mix them in with standard &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/06/05/human.html&quot;&gt;Human minions&lt;/a&gt; and make it
hard for players to tell them apart at first. Once the cultist’s capabilities
have been identified, it’s best to take then out with ranged attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fist-of-the-stone-tyrant&quot;&gt;Fist of the Stone Tyrant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every dwarf culture remembers their period of enslavement to the giants as the
Age of Chains. Most of them became resentful of the primordials after attaining
their freedom, and turned to worship of the gods. One felt the opposite, turning
away from the gods who did not help them and towards the primordials who had
proven they would reward their worshippers well. The Fist of the Stone Tyrant is
a champion from this culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Fist is a Level 9 Soldier (Leader) with 98 HP and a Speed of 5 (Earth
Walk). They have two simultaneous auras with a radius of 1: &lt;strong&gt;Rotting Earth&lt;/strong&gt;
slows enemies inside, and &lt;strong&gt;Stone Tyrant’s Boon&lt;/strong&gt; grants allies inside a +2
bonus to AC and Fortitude. Like any other dwarf, the Fist reduces any forced
movement inflicted upon it by 1. It also gets an immediate save to avoid being
knocked prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fist’s &lt;strong&gt;war pick&lt;/strong&gt; damages and marks for a turn on a hit, and if any marked
enemy leaves its Rotting Earth aura the champion can shift 1 square and make a
free attack against that enemy. The attack deals light physical damage, 5
ongoing necrotic damage (save ends) and immobilizes for a turn on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stone-thrall&quot;&gt;Stone Thrall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogres who live in hill giant territories might end up picking worship of
Ogrémoch from them. Some of these ogres get drawn into the cult and infused with
earth magic to act as guards and shock troops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone Thralls are Level 15 Brutes with 184 HP. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;Mauls&lt;/strong&gt; whose
basic attacks damage and force the target to grant combat advantage for a
turn. They can use a &lt;strong&gt;Crushing Smash&lt;/strong&gt; against someone granting them CA to do
heavier damage, knock the target prone, and make them both immobilized and
unable to stand up (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also make &lt;strong&gt;Wild Swings&lt;/strong&gt;, attacking up to 2 creatures with one
action. A hit deals heavy damage and dazes (save ends). This is an encounter
power that recharges when the ogre is first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;earth-weird&quot;&gt;Earth Weird&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogrémoch rarely deigns to notice individual mortals. Sometimes, though, a
cultist comes along with such an aptitude for earth magic that the primordial
ends up giving them a direct blessing. This turns them into earth weirds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one depicted here is an earthsoul genasi, and a Level 16 Controller with 148
HP. It fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Morningstar&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and pushes the target 1
square. It also uses a bunch of different earth-themed spells:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quake Bolt&lt;/strong&gt; is a basic ranged attack that damages and knocks prone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bury&lt;/strong&gt; targets a prone enemy and does no immediate damage, but it
immobilizes the target, prevents them from standing up and inflicts ongoing 10
damage (save ends all). After passing the save, the target is slowed for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stoneburst&lt;/strong&gt; is a ranged area attack that damages and created a zone of
difficult terraint for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;strong&gt;Earthshock&lt;/strong&gt; is a minor action encounter power that does no
damage but knocks every enemy touching a solid surface in a Close Burst 1
prone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weird wants to knock you down and bury you. It pairs well with other enemies
with knockdown abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chthonic-apostle&quot;&gt;Chthonic Apostle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most giants who serve Ogrémoch do so more out of fear than true devotion. This
one is an exception, and has been rewarded for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Apostle depicted here is a hill giant, and a Level 24 Soldier with 225
HP. It fights with a giant-sized, Reach 3 &lt;strong&gt;greatspear&lt;/strong&gt; whose basic attacks
damage and mark for a turn on a hit. It can also use the spear to &lt;strong&gt;impale&lt;/strong&gt; a
marked creature, which deals light physical damage to start with and slides the
creature to the apostle’s space as they slide down the length of the weapon. The
target is immobilized and takes 10 ongoing damage, automatically moving when the
apostle moves. The apostle can keep attacking with the spear, and every time
they do so the impaled victim takes another 10 damage and becomes dazed for a
turn. When they successfully save against this, they slide to a space adjacent
to the apostle as they free themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the apostle becomes bloodied, their &lt;strong&gt;Stone Curse&lt;/strong&gt; begins to take
effect. Their speed drops from the standard giant 8 to a 4, and they rain Resist
10 to all damage. When the apostle drops to 0 HP, they permanently become a
stone statue, which counts as blocking terrain. If they have a victim impaled
when that happens, the victim becomes restrained instead of immobilized. A save
still frees them as above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chthonic-stoneshaper&quot;&gt;Chthonic Stoneshaper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worship of Ogrémoch is almost as old as mortal life itself. There are profoundly
ancient shrines and temples to the primordial in the depths of the
Underdark. Those who undertake a prilgrimage to these sites and survive the
journey are rewarded with potent magic, and by having much of their troublesome
free will taken away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Stoneshaper depicted here is a human who has undergone this process. It’s
basically a powered-up Earth Weird, with more damaging spells. It’s Level 24
Artillery with 175 HP. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;Warhammers&lt;/strong&gt;, and have several
spells. First there’s &lt;strong&gt;Stony Embrace&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 10), a basic attack that
damages, restrains and inflicts 10 ongoing damage on a hit (save ends). Then
there’s &lt;strong&gt;Rending Earth&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 20), which targets enemies restrained by Stony
Embrace, deals slightly more damage, and stuns then (save ends). Finally there’s
&lt;strong&gt;Unruly Earth&lt;/strong&gt;, a close burst 2 that damages, pushes 3 squares, and knocks
prone on a hit. This only targets enemies, too, so it can be used safely in a
melee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “save ends” stun is extremely powerful, and though the targetting condition
for Rending Earth is fairly restrictive a focused and lucky stoneshaper might be
able to use it every other turn. When fighting an enemy group including a
stoneshaper, follow the old Shadowrun adage and geek the mage first. The
stoneshaper will make this hard because the ranges involved make it easy for the
stoneshaper to stay far away and play hit-and-run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogrémoch&quot;&gt;Ogrémoch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After looking at the cultists, it’s time to look at the Big Rock
himself. Ogrémoch’s domain is a flat-topped mountain in the depths of the
Elemental Chaos. He’s bound there by chains forged by Moradin from the whipping
winds that used to scoured that mountain. Though Ogrémoch is unable to leave his
domain, his confinement does not prevent him from affecting the mortal world
indirectly, and empowering his cultists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the cowardly Imix, Ogrémoch prefers to fight alone. His preferred
battlefields are vast rocky plains and enormous caverns where his powers can
easily shape the terrain. PCs will mostly likely fight him as a campaign end
boss, either in his own domain or in another similar battlefield after he
escapes his prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogrémoch is a Gargantuan Elemental Humanoid with the Earth and Primordial
keywords, and a Level 34 Solo Soldier with 1244 HP. He has a ground speed of 8
with Earth Walk, and can also burrow and climb at the same speed. His special
senses include Darkvision and Tremorsense 20, and he is immune to poison, sleep
and disease. He also has the best version of demon-style Variable Resistance,
with a value of 20 switchable 3 times per encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primordial has three passive traits that explain why he likes stony or
earthy battlefields. The first is &lt;strong&gt;Jagged Earth&lt;/strong&gt; is an aura (5) that turns its
area into difficult terrain. The first time a creature enters this aura on their
turn, they must pass a DC 32 Athletics or Acrobatics check or take 20
damage. Creatures with Earth Walk ignore the aura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second trait is &lt;strong&gt;Earthbound&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows Big O to ignore any forced
movement or knockdown effects as long as he’s standing on a solid surface. And
finally we have &lt;strong&gt;Earth Glide&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing him to pass through earth and stone
as if he had phasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His attacks of course include a lot of punches and their shockwaves, but before
we get to that, let’s look at the parallel minigame he’s got going with his
minor actions. &lt;strong&gt;Encasing Shards&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) is a Close Blast 5 that targets
the Fortitude of everyone caught inside. It does no immediate damage, but is one
of those very fun gradual petrification effects. On a hit the victims are
immobilized (save ends), and this worsens to stunned and finally to petrified as
they fail their saves. They can still roll saves to end the petrification, but
those have a -5 penalty. Once Ogrémoch is bloodied, he can detonate those stony
cocoons with &lt;strong&gt;Earthshatter&lt;/strong&gt;. This ends the petrification and makes a Close
Burst 3 attack centered on and including the victim. It deals a good bit of
physical damage for a minor action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogrémoch’s basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; that does a big chunk of damage and
automatically dazes all of the target’s adjacent targets for a
turn. &lt;strong&gt;Ogrémoch’s Fury&lt;/strong&gt; allows the primordial to make two slam attacks with
the same action, or three if bloodied. If more than one of these hits the same
target, it pushes that target 10 squares and worsens the Encasing Shards
condition if they’re currently affected by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth Smash&lt;/strong&gt; is a Close Blast 5 attack that does about half the damage of a
direct slam hit, but causes targets to fall prone and become dazed (save
ends). It does half damage on a miss. And then there’s &lt;strong&gt;Tremendous Quake&lt;/strong&gt;,
which is a Close Burst 10 and so is likely to affect every PC. It’s an attack
vs. Fortitude that does a amazing damage, slides 4 squares, knocks prone, dazes
and prevents the target from getting up (save ends for these last two). Even on
a miss it does half damage, slides 1 square and knocks prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he still has triggered actions! &lt;strong&gt;Jagged Eruption&lt;/strong&gt; is a Close Blast 3
attack that happens as a reaction to Ogrémoch getting hit with a melee
attack. &lt;strong&gt;Eternal Resilience&lt;/strong&gt; is the similar to Lolth’s ability, allowing him
to immediately roll a save when hit by an effect a save can end. This means such
effects only have a 25% chance of happening at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary: good luck keeping your balance or even acting at all when fighting a
living earthquake that’s also trying to petrify you. This much action denial on
a single monster is usually a design no-no, but we’re talking about a solo
endgame boss here, so I feel it’s more than justified.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ogre situation in the Monster Manual 3 is the same as the giant situation:
they first appeared in the Monster Manual 1, and are about to get new and
improved versions of those entries in the Monster Vault. The MM3 contains more
“exotic” variants that will nicely complement the rewritten “basic” ones from
the MV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Classic ogres, such as the ones that will show up on the Monster Vault, are
comically stupid brutes. The ones contained in this entry break that stereotype
by being significantly smarter, and capable of sophisticated tactics on the
level of any other humanoid opposition. In other words, the Monster Vault will
Ogre Harder while the Monster Manual 3 will Ogre Smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extra brainpower of these ogres doesn’t necessarily make them &lt;em&gt;nice&lt;/em&gt; - the
entries here are still all Chaotic Evil, they’re just smarter about it. Nothing
prevents you from Shreking it up and having ogres that are both smart and
non-evil at your table, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, Ogres are Large Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 8. Everything
else about them varies per stat block, though their abilities tend to be styled
as big smashy strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogre-cave-hunter&quot;&gt;Ogre Cave Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is &lt;em&gt;sneaky&lt;/em&gt;. The Cave Hunter has learned to perform stealthy raids,
evade pursuers, and lure them to ambush spots disguised to look like the ogre’s
home cave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cave Hunters are Level 8 Lurkers with 70 HP. Like typical ogres, they wear hide
and fight with ogre-sized &lt;strong&gt;Clubs&lt;/strong&gt; that have Reach 2. However they can use
these weapons in more creative ways beyond the usual basic attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smash and Swing&lt;/strong&gt; does half the damage of a basic attack, but dazes for a turn
and allows the ogre to slide the target up to 5 squares on a hit. It’s excellent
for herding PCs together so other monsters can use area attacks, and for opening
them up for the truly damaging attacks from the cave hunter itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these is &lt;strong&gt;Skull Bash&lt;/strong&gt;, which requires a dazed target and does
roughly double the damage of a basic attack. The second is &lt;strong&gt;Victim Shield&lt;/strong&gt;, an
interrupt that requires a dazed enemy within 2 squares and triggers when it’s
targeted by a melee or ranged attack. It gives the ogre +4 to defenses against
that attack, and if the attack misses the chosen victim takes its damage
instead. In that case the cave hunter can also slide the victim 4 squares to
another space within 2 squares of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the hunter doesn’t need to have dazed the victims itself in order to
use these abilities, so if there are other monsters who can daze in the fight,
they’ll be able to use these abilities more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogre-ironclad&quot;&gt;Ogre Ironclad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ogre Ironclads are smart enough to wear piecemeal metal armor instead of the
more usual raw hides, and to fight using tactics that resemble cavalry, with
closed ranks and powerful charges. Since their armor is still kind of
improvised, being looted from smaller victims, it tends to fall off if it takes
too many hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironclads are Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They wield big &lt;strong&gt;Mauls&lt;/strong&gt; whose basic
attacks mark for a turn on a hit. Their &lt;strong&gt;Ironclad Reaction&lt;/strong&gt; gives them a free
attack against a marked enemy that ignores the mark, and this attack also pushes
the enemy 1 square and knocks them prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the ironclad is bloodied they take a -2 penalty to AC, but their charges
allow them to make basic attacks against up to 2 targets instead of the usual
single attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogre-storm-shaman&quot;&gt;Ogre Storm Shaman&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storm Shamans are perhaps the only ogres in the books that have no negative
modifiers in any of their mental attributes. They worship the primal spirits
that symbolize the fury of the storm, and their magic can bring that fury down
on their enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storm Shamans are Level 11 Controllers with 114 HP. All of their attacks have a
storm magic theme. They can cast &lt;strong&gt;Thunder Blasts&lt;/strong&gt; to deal thunder damage and
deafen (save ends), or &lt;strong&gt;Call Lightning&lt;/strong&gt; to deal lightning damage and blind
(save ends). Their melee attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Thunder Staff&lt;/strong&gt; that deals thunder damage
and can daze (save ends) if it hits a blinded or deafened enemy. Those ranged
spells are also area attacks, so there’s a big chance that they’ll leave
&lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; vulnerable to a daze from the staff. A second shaman in the encounter
will make them both even more annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ogre-dreadnought&quot;&gt;Ogre Dreadnought&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, this is pretty much an upgraded version of the Ogre Ironclad
above. Unlike the Ironclad, the Dreadnought actually uses custom-fitted gear,
wearing a full suit of plate and wielding a greatsword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dreadnoughts are Level 14 Soldiers with 140 HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;greatsword&lt;/strong&gt; has a
Threatening Reach 2, and its basic attack also immobilizes for a turn on a
hit. If the dreadnought fails a saving throw, it can use &lt;strong&gt;Dreadnought Resolve&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 4+) as a reaction to immediately reroll it with a +2 bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re almost Brutes, in other words, since they lack a marking power. Still,
Threatening Reach and immobilizing attacks make them effective at halting the
PCs’ advance, so the Soldier role still fits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pretty varied lineup, especially when combined with the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/08/13/ogre.html&quot;&gt;Monster Vault
ogres&lt;/a&gt;. It should easily allow you to build all-ogre encounters for use as
the inhabitants of a lair or as a special unit in some other villainous force.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This based on the Obliviax, a monster that showed up in the 1e MM2. It’s
completely changed for this edition, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oblivion moss, sometimes also known as memory moss, is a sapient predatory plant
that lives in the depths of old forests. It looks like a carpet of moss, but it
can perceive its surroundings and move around slowly in search of prey. The
creature feeds on memories, which it strips from the brains of its victims. It
derives sustenance from those stolen thoughts, and can also use them to spawn
humanoid simulacra that help it defend itself and find more food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memory stripping process is not actually fatal or permanent, but it’s still
very traumatic. Stolen memories return at different rates. An adventurer’s
knowledge of combat spells and maneuvers might come back after mere seconds,
still in the middle of the fight. Important personal memories (“who am I?”) come
back after a day or two, but smaller details (“what does my mother look like?”)
can take weeks to be restored. Of course, the moss and its constructs are quite
capable of fighting to kill, and might choose to kill a victim anyway after
stealing their memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dryads and Treants cultivate patches of oblivion moss close to their own
territories, as a security measure. Invaders who stumble upon them have their
memories ripped away and end up turned around, leaving the forest without
knowing what they were doing or where they went while inside. Even if the
knowledge comes back later, very few people are keen on repeating the
experience. As the book says, in places where oblivion moss grows, lost ruins
tend to stay lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can turn the memory stealing around, too. The remains of a slain patch of
oblivion moss retain memory fragments from its past victims, and if someone eats
those bits they can acquire those memories. While the fragmentary memories of a
bandit might not give you their entire guard rotation or the map of their
stronghold, they might give you the combination to their main vault or to a
secret door.  That can be useful, though eating a sapient being presents obvious
ethical problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a bunch of different stat blocks here, one for the moss itself and five
for the humanoid minions it can build from stolen memories. The minions can be
generated mid-fight by the moss, or they might be placed as normal monsters in
an encounter with or without their master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oblivion-moss-mindmaster&quot;&gt;Oblivion Moss Mindmaster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the moss itself, a Large Fey Magical Beast (plant) and a Level 12 Elite
Controller with 250 HP. It perceives the world with Blindsight 20, and moves
around at a glacial ground and climb speeds of 2. It does have Forest Walk,
though, so it’s not further slowed down by difficult terrain in its natural
habitat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moss projects a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Blindness Aura&lt;/strong&gt; (1) that makes it invisible to
enemies that start their turns inside until the end of the enemy’s next turn. It
can defend itself in melee with a &lt;strong&gt;Corriding Touch&lt;/strong&gt; that does immediate and
ongoing acid damage, but it really wants to use its psychic powers instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has two basic ranged attacks: &lt;strong&gt;Scramble the Mind&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Scour the
Mind&lt;/strong&gt;. Both to the same amount of psychic damage. Additionally, Scramble slides
the target 5 squares and Scour makes the moss or one of its allies invisible to
the target for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its ultimate attack is &lt;strong&gt;Absorb Memories&lt;/strong&gt;, a ranged attack vs. Will that does
no damage. A hit prevents the target from using encounter or daily attack powers
(save ends). Hit or miss, the moss then creates a mossling duplicate of the
target, which uses the most closely matching mossling stat block (see
below). This recharges when there are no created mosslings in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mindmaster can spend a minor action to &lt;strong&gt;Direct&lt;/strong&gt; a mossling, allowing it to
move its speed as a free action. And it can also &lt;strong&gt;Absorb Damage&lt;/strong&gt; as an
interrupt, taking into itself the damage from an attack that would hit a
mossling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a moss mindmaster would only be able to keep a single mossling around at a
time. If you want there to be more of them, add some as part of the initial
encounter makeup. Those don’t count as “created”, so the moss doesn’t have to
wait to use Absorb Memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mosslings&quot;&gt;Mosslings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mosslings are Medium Fey Humanoids, and all of them are Level 12
Minions. They’re meant to be copies of people whose memories were absorbed by
the oblivion moss - the creature is smart enough to seek out competent
combatants for this purpose, since they make for more powerful mosslings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their signature passive trait is &lt;strong&gt;Mindmaster’s Thrall&lt;/strong&gt; - if the mossling in
question was created by an oblivion moss mindmaster, it acts immediately after
its creator’s turn. They all have Forest Walk too, and a basic tendril attack
that does minion-tier damage and has a rider compatible with their role. But the
real star of the show here is the &lt;strong&gt;Simulacrum Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows them to
copy an at-will power from a PC!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the mossling was created by Absorb Memories during this fight, it will be a
power from the PC that attack targeted. If you’re adding the mossling as part of
the encounter, pick a PC whose class is similar to the mossling’s role and give
them one of that PC’s powers. The attack targets AC and its bonus is based on
the mossling’s level as normal, but the damage and all other effects are
identical to the PC’s, as if it was the PC who hit. Some of them copy melee
attacks, others copy ranged attacks, but the match-up is not a problem because
you always use a mossling archetype compatible with the power you want to
replicate, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book recommends having &lt;em&gt;the players themselves&lt;/em&gt; roll and resolve the
mossling’s attacks, to reinforce the feeling that they’re fighting
themselves. That’s clever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the different varieties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Guardian&lt;/strong&gt;: Soldier, speed 6. Has an aura (1) that slows
enemies. Tendril attack allows it to shift 1 square and pull an enemy into the
vacated space. Copies a melee power. Use to copy PC defenders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Creeper&lt;/strong&gt;: Skirmisher, speed 8. Deals extra damage with combat
advantage. Tendril strike allows it to shift 2 squares. Shifts 2 squares when
missed by a melee attack. Copies a melee power. Use to copy rogues and other
melee strikers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Hurler&lt;/strong&gt;: Artillery, speed 6. Explodes on death, dealing a bit of
psychic damage and inflicting Daze (save ends) on a Close Burst 2. No riders
on tendril attack. Steals a ranged power. Use to copy ranged strikers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Grower&lt;/strong&gt;: Controller (Leader). Has an aura (1) that grants +2
defense to plant allies. Tendril attack slows for a turn. Gives 20 temporary
hit points to every nonminion plant ally within 3 squares on death. Copies a
melee power. Use to copy warlords and other leaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossling Vinecaller&lt;/strong&gt;: Controller. Has an aura (1) that makes the covered
spaces difficult terrain. Makes a Close Burst 1 in to difficult terrain for
the rest of the encounter on death. Tendril strike slides target 2
squares. Copies a ranged power. Use to copy wizards and other controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the mossling mechanic is really clever, particularly the bit where
players roll and resolve their duplicate’s attacks. It helps ease the GM’s
cognitive load a bit since mosslings are kinda finnicky even before you factor
the copied attack in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, a moss mindmaster can only keep one mossling around at a
time. If you want to have more of them in play, the easiest way is to add more
of them as standard minions to the encounter. In this case I guess they would
have their own Initiative rolls, and would be worth XP as normal, but the
mindmaster could still target them with Direct Mossling and Absorb Damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option might be to turn the Mindmaster into a solo! Aside from the usual
adjustments, you would want to make Absorb Memories at-will and remove the limit
on the number of created mosslings in play. Maybe also turn Absorb Damage into a
Free or No Action to make it usable as many times per turn as the moss wants.&lt;/p&gt;
