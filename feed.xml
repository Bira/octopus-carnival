        <title>Let&apos;s Read the Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Dragon of Tyr</title>

  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    The Dragon of Tyr, making a dapper pose for the camera.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry appeared among the monsters, right where you’d find standard dragons
in another monster book. I thought this was odd, because he’s the only dragon in
Athas and also one of its more important “personages”, so why isn’t he in that
section?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer, I suspect, is because to be in the Personages section the character
has to be someone who could be a potential ally to the PCs, and the Dragon of
Tyr is not someone any party of PCs should be allying with. Instead, he’s the
final boss of Dark Sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless I’m talking about him here, because he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; an important personage
and knowing his story gives a lot of context for the sorcerer-kings you’ll also
find in this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone in Athas knows and fears the Dragon of Tyr. This great and terrible
monster comes in from somewhere on the other side of the Sea of Silt every once
in a while, and demands a huge tribute of treasure and slaves. Even the
sorcerer-kings fear him, and so they scramble to meet his demands. Once that’s
done, the Dragon flies home with his loot, leaving the region alone until his
next appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is common knowledge. Only the sorcerer-kings themselves know the
full story: the Dragon was once one of them. His original name was Borys the
Butcher, and like his colleagues he was one of the fifteen secret apprentices of
Rajaat the Sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, arcane magic on Athas is a truly unnatural phenomenon, a flaw that
slipped into the world when the primordials defeated the gods way back when
Athas was still green. Rajaat was the first mortal to discover and master arcane
magic. He was also the first to learn that you could pull more power from the
life around you to cast bigger spells - in other words, the first defiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajaat taught dozens of pupils, but he only taught the secret of defiling to his
inner circle of fifteen secret apprentices. For Rajaat was a major asshole, and
when he felt his Champions were ready, he ordered them to go out on a worldwide
genocidal rampage to cleanse Athas of all the species he deemed “impure”. So
much defiling magic was flung around in those wars that Athas’ previously green
ecosystem was completely destroyed, starting the world’s transformation into the
desert it is today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, even the Champions became convinced that all of this was a bit too
much. Led by Borys, they turned on their master and managed to imprison him in a
pocket dimension outside of time and space. Once Rajaat was out of the picture,
the former Champions quickly conquered or built city-states in one of the last
habitable regions of Athas, setting themselves up as the Sorcerer-Kings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By then, they knew that attaining the pinnacle of power as a defiler would lead
to transformation into a dragon. Borys, who had taken it upon himself to guard
Rajaat’s prison, successfully argued that the other Sorcerer-Kings should help
him speedrun the transformation, since he’d need the power to contain their
former master forever. And so they did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ritual for the final transformation required the sacrifice of every citizen
of Ebe, the island city Borys ruled. Borys renamed the resulting hellish
wasteland Ur Draxa, the City of Doom. The Dragon dwells in the ruins of Ur
Draxa’s palace to this day, leaving the city only to collect his tributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city itself is inhabited by a very large number of undead, and by the living
slaves brought in as tribute. The city’s day to day operation is in the hands of
the Dead Lords, a council of liches who serve the Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dragon keeps their soul vessels (the book uses the p-word here) hidden deep
within his palace to ensure compliance. He is wise to do this, for the Lord
Vizier who leads the council has his own agenda. He’s secretly researching a way
to cross into the Astral Sea and escape Athas altogether, and often sends his
personal minions out on missions to recover any bit of planar lore he hears
about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get stats for the Dragon of Tyr and for the Lord Vizier in this entry. The
two are completely different, of course, so we’ll cover all their traits in
their respective entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-dragon-of-tyr&quot;&gt;The Dragon of Tyr&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only dragon in Athas is a Gargantuan Natural Magical Beast with the Dragon
tag (obviously). He’s also a Level 33 Solo Controller with 1216 HP, Darkvision,
ground and flight speeds of 10, and a teleport speed of 5. He can hover,
too. His alignment is Chaotic Evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Dragon’s Actions&lt;/strong&gt; trait means old Borys doesn’t roll initiative at
all. He has three whole turns per round at initiative counts 40, 30, and 20. He
cannot delay or ready actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His basic attack is a massive Reach 4 &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and strips all
necrotic and psychic resistance on a hit (save ends). His &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; deals more or
less the same damage and immobilizes (save ends), with a Slow aftereffect (save
ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can also use wider swipes to perform the &lt;strong&gt;Raking Claws&lt;/strong&gt; attack, attacking
all enemies in a Close Blast 4 for slightly less damage than the single-target
version and also sliding them 2 squares on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for physical attacks. Now for the spells and psychic powers, because
of course he has both!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Dragon’s Defiling&lt;/strong&gt; is a hazard all on its own, targetting all creatures
in a Close Burst 5 and dealing necrotic damage on a hit. He can use the energy
gathered with this to cast &lt;strong&gt;Defiling Death&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10), dealing heavy
necrotic damage and ongoing 20 necrotic damage to the target (save ends). After
the first failed save, the ongoing damage increases to 30!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dragon of Tyr starts the fight with Defiling Death charged, and once it’s
cast he must hit with Dragon’s Defiling to recharge the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the Dragon is bloodied, he can use his &lt;strong&gt;Breath of Shredding Sand&lt;/strong&gt;,
attacking all creatures in a &lt;em&gt;Close Blast 20&lt;/em&gt; and dealing the same amount of
damage as the bite on a hit, half on a miss. Fortunately this is an encounter
power and doesn’t recharge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if the PCs manage to surround Borys, he can use a &lt;strong&gt;Telekinetic Pulse&lt;/strong&gt;
(encounter), a Close Burst 5 that deals the same damage as the bite, pushes its
targets 5 squares, and knocks them prone. On a miss, it deals half damage and
pushes 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dragon can use his move action on a &lt;strong&gt;Psionic Uplift&lt;/strong&gt;, automatically
pushing every adjacent enemy 2 squares and flying his Speed + 2 (i.e, 12
squares). If an enemy ends its movement within 4 squares of the Dragon, he can
hit them with his &lt;strong&gt;Lashing Tail&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction, dealing the same damage as the
claw and knocking them prone. And when the dragon is first bloodied, Telekinetic
Pulse recharges and he can use it immediately as a free action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The physical attacks all target AC, the necrotic and tekekinetic ones all target
Fortitude, and the sand breath targets Reflex. As the most powerful arcane
caster in the whole world, you can say he knows pretty much every ritual in the
game for use outside of combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-lord-vizier&quot;&gt;The Lord Vizier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the oldest and most powerful lich among the council of Dead Lords, which
makes him their leader. Ostensibly, he un-lives to serve his master the Dragon,
but as we saw he’s also privately looking for a way off this dying rock. He is a
Medium Natural Humanoid with the Undead tag, and Level 26 Elite Artillery. He
has Speed 6, and Darkvision. He’s immune to diseases like all undead, and has
Resist 15 Necrotic and Resist 10 Poison. His alignment is Evil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord Vizier has a &lt;strong&gt;Necrotic Aura&lt;/strong&gt; (5) that deals 10 necrotic damage to
anyone who enters it or starts their turn inside. Like all liches, he’s
&lt;strong&gt;Indestructible&lt;/strong&gt; while his soul vessel remains intact: when reduced to 0 HP,
his body and possessions become dust and reform within 1d10 days near the
vessel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wields the &lt;strong&gt;Dead Lord’s Scepter&lt;/strong&gt;, and his basic attack is to bonk someone
with it, dealing lightning-and-necrotic damage. His basic ranged attack is the
&lt;strong&gt;Grasp of the Dead&lt;/strong&gt; spell (range 20 vs. Fortitude), which deals necrotic
damage and lets one undead creature adjacent to the target make a free melee
basic attack. If the attack hits, the creature marks the target for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can also cast a &lt;strong&gt;Plume of Death&lt;/strong&gt; (area 2 within 10 vs. Fortitude, recharge
5+), a fireball-sized spell that deals acid-and-necrotic damage and summons a
Vizier’s Skeleton on a square within the burst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a move action, the Lord can draw on his secret knowledge and perform a brief
&lt;strong&gt;Planar Displacement&lt;/strong&gt;, teleporting 15 squares and leaving a brand-new Vizier’s
Skeleton in the origin square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;viziers-skeleton&quot;&gt;Vizier’s Skeleton&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sophisticated undead minions are constantly produced by the Lord Vizier’s
special attacks, and he will probably have a whole bunch of them on hand when
the fight starts in addition to some powerful non-minion undead. They’re Medium
Natural Animates (undead) and Level 26 Minion Brutes who fight with &lt;strong&gt;Deadflame
Swords&lt;/strong&gt; that do fire-and-necrotic damage, and can shoot &lt;strong&gt;Chill Shards&lt;/strong&gt;
(Ranged 10) to do cold-and-necrotic damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When met outside his city, the Dragon is always alone and on a specific
mission. He will usually completely ignore most people who have nothing to do
with his goal, believing they are beneath his notice. Of course, if those people
are stupid enough to pick a fight with him, he is only too glad to oblige,
completely confident of his victory and with good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he is attacked &lt;em&gt;in Ur Draxa&lt;/em&gt;, I imagine the Dead Lords would join the fight
too. Better bring an army or ten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord Vizier generally obeys the Dragon’s every order and kills whoever he
wants dead. I wonder if he can be met in friendlier terms when following his own
agenda. Epic PCs would make perfect agents for recovering that lost lore without
the Dragon noticing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Personages of Athas</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’d normally expect a monster book to end right after the “Zombie” entry, but
we’re only at the two-third mark on this one. We’re now entering the section on
the “Personages of Athas”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book has a really short intro for it, explaining that it takes a lot of
skill and luck to survive for long in this world, and that this is a sample of
people who managed to do exactly that and are therefore remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between the entries in this section and the ones in the monster
section are not mechanical. As far as I can understand, every entry in this
section concerns one or more specific individuals. And while I haven’t read
every entry yet, I also suspect the book doesn’t expect them to automatically be
your enemies. They could be entirely neutral to your goals, or they might even
be potential allies. While one of these things is also often true about the
monster entries, both should be true for everyone in this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is why the Dragon of Tyr was in the monster section. He is a
specific individual, but he’s also the “final boss” of Dark Sun. By default,
he’s not particularly interested in making new alliances and no PC party who
isn’t completely rotten to the core would think of allying with him for real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sorcerer-Kings, however, &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in the Personages section, because I imagine
PCs might want to form temporary alliances with some of them against the
others. We’ll also see a bunch of much lower level randos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stated in an earlier post, I decided to move the Dragon’s description to
this section as I consider him to be more of a Personage than a monster. So
we’ll start with him on the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Creature Catalog: Zombie</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-zombie.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    This is similar to a zombie, but it seems to be a repurposed
    picture of another creature.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zombies in Athas have the same origin as zombies in every other D&amp;amp;D world:
they’re created either intentionally by necromancy, or accidentally from dead
bodies left for long enough in areas exposed to strong necrotic energies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Athas that means areas touched by the Gray, the Darker and Sunnier version of
the Shadowfell. Any bodies left in these places have a high chance of rising as
zombies. As the natural environment in these areas tends to be particularly
harsh as well, they can do interesting things to these bodies before they rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common of those is that by the time the body rises its flesh is long
gone due to the actions of predators and scouring winds, so you get a skeleton
instead. But some places like the ones named below can preserve the flesh of a
corpse, giving enough time to rise as a Darker and Sunnier Zombie with extra
powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The zombies described in this entry are Natural Humanoids, which I think
is an error because every other zombie is a Natural Animate. In any case, they
have the Undead tag and the usual immunity to poison and disease and resistance
to necrotic damage. They also tend to be faster than standard zombie varieties
(which still exist in Athas!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;salt-zombie&quot;&gt;Salt Zombie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are created from the big necrotic zone in the Salt Meres. They tend to lie
beneath the salt flats, erupting out of the ground when they sense living beings
walking the surface. They probably look dried out and mummified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salt Zombies are Level 1 Soldiers with 28 HP and a ground speed of 6. Their
necrotic resistance is 5 and they have Vulnerable 5 to Radiant damage. Their
basic &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; damage and grab on a hit, but their &lt;strong&gt;Salt Feast&lt;/strong&gt; attack is
usually more effective: it does the same damage and also grabs, but the target
has a -4 penalty to escape the grab and takes another 5 damage every time they
fail. And of course, the zombie can also keep attacking the grabbed target
either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also suffer from the &lt;strong&gt;Zombie Weakness&lt;/strong&gt; that afflicts a lot of standard
zombies, and so are instantly destroyed when someone scores a critical hit on
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;black-reaver-zombies&quot;&gt;Black Reaver Zombies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There originate from the Black Sands region. Legend has it that an ancient act
of defiling magic summoned these sands into the region, and that they drained
the souls of everyone they touched. There’s a creepy deserted city at its
center, which was presumably the target of this magical WMD. Modern Athasians
tend to give it a wide berth, and anyone who dies here will probably rise as one
of these zombies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black Reavers are Level 5 Lurkers with 51 HP and a zippy ground speed
of 7. They’re blind, and so have the corresponding tag and are immune to
blinding and gaze attacks, perceiving the world through their
Blindsight 10. Their necrotic resistant is 10, and while they don’t take extra
damage from radiant damage it does prevent them from using their Shadow Burst
power for a turn, basically defanging them for that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, their basic &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; does a relatively weak mix of physical and
necrotic damage, so they really need the extra necrotic damage from attacking a
target that couldn’t see them at the start of their turn in order to be a threat
to equivalent-level PCs. And the most likely way for them to get that bonus is
&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Burst&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+), a move action that lets them teleport 5 squares
and create a Burst 1 zone that blinds everyone inside around their arrival
point. This zone lasts for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using these in an encounter, you might want to add plenty of
vision-blocking terrain to the battle map, like ruined buildings or big rocks. A
zombie without Shadow Burst could still get that damage bonus if it was behind
such terrain before charging out and attacking, something its high Speed would
help with. Darkness also helps, but not as much since PCs are likely to have
many options for lighting up the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;feasting-zombie&quot;&gt;Feasting Zombie&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one appears in the Forest Ridge where halflings live. Halflings who catch
terminal diseases are not eaten when they die, for obvious reasons. Instead,
they’re buried, which is believed to return them to nature’s embrace. This
alternate funerary practice is less effective at preventing them from rising as
zombies when conditions are right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feasting zombies are Small, since they originate from halflings, and they’re
Level 6 Minion Brutes with Speed 5. They &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;, and when they die they
perform a &lt;strong&gt;Clamping Bite Death Chomp&lt;/strong&gt;, which does the same damage as the bite
attack and also slows (save ends) because the dead zombie doesn’t let go until
you pry it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cinder-zombies&quot;&gt;Cinder Zombies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were killed and preserved by fire. This could be because they lived in
some of the volcanic islands in the Sea of Silt, of because their village was
torched by raiders. They’re charred instead of rotten, and therefore smell of
burned meat. They’re also quite strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cinder Zombies are Level 12 Soldiers with 121 HP and Speed 5. They have Resist
Necrotic 15, Resist Fire 10, and Vulnerable Radiant 5. They project an aura of
&lt;strong&gt;Burning Embers&lt;/strong&gt; that deal 10 fire damage to any enemy who leaves the aura,
giving them an incentive to remain close. They pummel enemies with their &lt;strong&gt;Fists
of Cinder&lt;/strong&gt; that do a mix of physical and fire damage. If an enemy within their
aura makes an attack that doesn’t target them, the zombie uses &lt;strong&gt;Punishing
Sparks&lt;/strong&gt; on them to deal a bit of fire damage on a hit. When the creature is
first bloodied, it releases a &lt;strong&gt;Choking Cloud&lt;/strong&gt; that attacks the Fortitude of
enemies in a Close Burst 3. On a hit it deals poison damage and prevents them
from spending healing surges (save ends). On a miss it deals half damage and
prevents surge expenditure for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the four zombie types presented here are new, they’re still zombies. You
use them in the same way you use standard zombies which, again, exist on
Athas. I think I like the cinder zombies the most, as they have an interesting
Defender Aura-like setup and fire zombies make sense in non-Athas settings too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While three of the four zombies presented here are strongly associated with
their specific home regions, there’s nothing preventing an enterprising villain
from importing them to wherever their lair is, or from somehow replicating the
process of their creation in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Wight</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-wight.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A wight posing in a threatening manner.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athasian wights are, at their root, pretty much the same as standard ones:
undead whose soulless bodies are animated by a scrap of animus (or will) the
dead person left behind. However, their description here goes on to say that
wights were driven to complete some kind of mission or achieve an important goal
when they died, and the “will” that animates them is an obsession with
fulfilling that task. It also gives them an eternal hunger for life force, and
robs them of the capacity to feel anything but hatred, grief, and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can technically exorcize a wight by fulfilling its task. This is extremely
difficult &lt;em&gt;at best&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s often impossible. Wights are not exactly willing
to give detailed interviews about the circumstances of their death. Even if the
PCs can discover those many of the creatures have been dead for so long that all
people and places involved are simply gone. This will probably force the PCs to
resort to the second most effective anti-wight strategy: extreme violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a wight to be truly destroyed, its body must be obliterated. A popular
tactic is to dismember and then burn their corpses. Not doing this means the
creature will restore itself and return eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wights presented here are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead keyword,
and a bunch of traditional undead traits: Darkvision, immunity to disease and
poison, 10 resistance to necrotic damage, and and 5 or 10 vulnerability to
Radiant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These wights tend to lack the default ability to eat your healing surges, but
they gain other individualized tricks in its place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wight-thrall&quot;&gt;Wight Thrall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the exception to the wight lore I described above because they’re
&lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; living their best unlife. Their obsession was to serve their beloved
master for all eternity, and that’s exactly what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wight thralls have about as much initiative as your typical zombie, but they’re
&lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better at following their master’s commands. If you find these, their
master is likely nearby, either as a more powerful wight or as some other
monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures are Level 12 Minion Brutes with a speed of 7 and the standard
traits mentioned above (except radiant vulnerability). Their &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; damage
and have a life drain effect that’s modeled slightly differently: targets hit by
the attack cannot gain temporary HP at all and recover 5 less HP from healing
effects (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When destroyed by non-radiant damage, their &lt;strong&gt;Dark Passing&lt;/strong&gt; ability restores 5
HP to a nearby undead ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dune-runner-wight&quot;&gt;Dune Runner Wight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an elf who died trying to deliver an important message or warning to
their community. Every night they arise and try to complete the impossible run,
only to appear back at the starting point when the sun rises. During the day,
they terrorize nearby creatures to vent their frustration and slake their
thirst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dune Runner Wights are level 12 Minion Skirmishers with 124 HP and the common
traits mentioned above. Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; have no effect beyond their decent
damage, but they deal extra damage if the runner moved at least 4 squares before
attacking, and can be used as part of a &lt;strong&gt;Mobile Melee Attack&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver that
lets the runner move its speed without and attack at any point during the move
without provoking an opportunity attack from the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a 1/round minor action, they can try to afflict someone with a &lt;strong&gt;Running
Curse&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5 vs. Will), which forces at target to move at least 4 squares
on their turn or take a bit of psychic damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oath-wight&quot;&gt;Oath Wight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These used to be inhabitants of one of Athas’ many ancient ruins, who were on
the verge of completing an important task when their entire city was leveled by
a sorcerous WMD of some kind. Maybe they were scholars nearing a research
breakthrough, maybe they were thieves about to pull that big score… or maybe
they were mothers undergoing childbirth. So there’s some nightmare fuel for
ya. They’re Level 14 Elite Controllers with 140 HP and a speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their frustration with the futility of their task is so potent it leaks out, and
can be used as a weapon. This aura of &lt;strong&gt;Inevitable Failure&lt;/strong&gt; inflicts a -2
penalty to attacks, skill checks, and defenses to any non-dominated enemies
inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wight can dominate enemies with its &lt;strong&gt;Accursed Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (minor action, ranged
5 vs. Will), which dominates for a turn on a hit. It can also use the
&lt;strong&gt;Frustration’s Fury&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power, which attacks the Will of 2 nearby
targets. On a hit, it reals psychic damage and forces the target to make a free
melee basic attack (or a charge!)  against another target of the wight’s
choice. If this secondary attack &lt;em&gt;misses&lt;/em&gt;, the target is dominated (save
ends). A miss with the power deals half damage and dazes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Frustration’s Fury is unavailable, the wight uses its basic &lt;strong&gt;Rotting
Touch&lt;/strong&gt;, which does necrotic damage and prevents HP recovery for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were wondering why the wight has so little HP for an elite, it’s because
reaching 0 HP triggers its &lt;strong&gt;Promised Return&lt;/strong&gt; power, causing it to reappear
with full HP near its last position at the start of its next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The description of wights as the products of obsession that lingers beyond death
is so cool that I’m tempted to make this the default description of wights in
any game I run. The mechanics of the ones presented here are interesting and
help bring them into the paragon tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wights might very rarely work with the living if they can convince the creature
they have similar goals, but they mostly hang out with other undead or with
predatory beasts who don’t see them as food.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Thri-Kreen</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-thri-kreen.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A thri-kreen mantis warrior with a green carapace.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thri-kreen are the famous mantis-people of Athas. A slightly more generic
version of them appeared in the Monster Manual 3, and now we get more NPC stat
blocks here and a playable version in the Campaign Guide. Unlike what happened
to muls a few pages back, thri-kreen in the Creature Catalog are given a
description that’s about as positive as the one for the playable version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thri-kreen have deep instinctual bonds of loyalty to their “clutch” and their
“pack”. As the Campaign Guide explains, a clutch is a small group of at most six
individuals to whom the thri-kreen feels closest, and a pack is an extended
family composed of multiple clutches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally a clutch is formed by individuals who hatched from their eggs at
around the same time, but kreen can “adopt” other clutches over time if
circumstances demand. For PCs, this means their adventuring party is their
clutch. NPC kreen away from their homes will have similar arrangements with
their ally groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those ubiquitous asshole slavers like to steal Thri-kreen eggs so that their can
exploit their bonding instinct, making them extremely loyal to their new
masters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thri-kreen packs prefer to hunt non-sapient creatures for food, but they will
make exceptions in truly desperate times. They will fight with all their
strenght to protect themselves from attacks by other people, but will almost
never be the aggressors in such fights. Their spiritual leaders are known as
desert talkers, and are responsible for maintaining their connection to the
primal spirits of the desert and those of their ancestors. This gives them a
very long genetic memory, stretching back to an ancient age where they had their
own great empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These NPC thri-kreen are Medium Natural Humanoids with Low-Light Vision. The
ones here have ground speeds between 6 and 7, slightly slower than the MM3
ones. Their signature ability remains &lt;strong&gt;Mantis Jump&lt;/strong&gt;, an move-action encounter
power that lets them jump their speed without provoking opportunity
attacks. This is indeed different from the power PCs get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get three new stat blocks here, which can be mixed in with the ones from the
MM3 without any extra work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thri-kreen-bounder&quot;&gt;Thri-Kreen Bounder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are less experienced hunters who are still learning the tricks of the
trade by observing the pack’s veterans at work. They tend to be a little more
skittish than those veterans. They’re Level 6 Minion Skirmishers with a ground
speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Deft Dodger&lt;/strong&gt; trait gives them +2 to defenses against ranged attacks,
which helps them survive longer in a fight. They attack in melee with &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt;
and at range with thrown &lt;strong&gt;Chatkchas&lt;/strong&gt;, which are three-pointed throwing blades
with Range 6/12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of Mantis Jump they have &lt;strong&gt;Mantis Bound&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them jump 3
squares without provoking opportunity attacks as a reaction to being missed by
an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thri-kreen-mauler&quot;&gt;Thri-Kreen Mauler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the veteran hunters, big and beefy thri-kreen who single out a quarry,
jump on top of it, and tear it apart. They’re Level 8 Brutes with 105 HP and a
speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic &lt;strong&gt;Claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack is way too weak for a level 8 brute (average damage
9), but &lt;strong&gt;Mauler Frenzy&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+) lets them make two of those, three when
bloodied. &lt;strong&gt;Mauler Leap&lt;/strong&gt; lets them jump 6 squares and make two claw attacks
with a +1 to attack and a +4 to damage, which definitely matches the
formula. This recharges when they’re first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the mauler hits a bloodied target with their claws, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Pain
Amplification&lt;/strong&gt; against that rarget with a minor action, attacking their
Fortitude. A hit causes the target to take ongoing 5 psychic damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If multiple claw attacks aren’t on the cards this turn, the mauler can use its
&lt;strong&gt;Chatkchas&lt;/strong&gt; at range, which do level-appropriate physical damage. Mantis Jump
rounds out their arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Maulers will try to avoid getting killed like any opponent, they don’t
mind getting bloodied since it makes them stronger. They probably should try to
open the fight with a Leap, get stuck in for a Frenzy or two, and then jump away
for that second use of Mauler Leap once bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thri-kreen-mantis-warrior&quot;&gt;Thri-Kreen Mantis Warrior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mantis Warriors are hunt leaders, highly skilled with both weapons and psychic
powers. They’re Level 10 Elite Soldiers with 208 HP and a ground speed of 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They still have their &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt;, and also carry a &lt;strong&gt;Gythka&lt;/strong&gt;, a light polearm
with a trident-like head on either end. Both do equivalent damage, but the
gythka marks for a turn on a hit and does a blend of physical and psychic damage
instead of just physical. They can also throw &lt;strong&gt;Chatkchas&lt;/strong&gt;, though these are a
bit weaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Mantis Flurry&lt;/strong&gt; ability allows the warrior to make a claw and a gythka
attack, or to throw two chatkchas, with a single action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally they can pull off a &lt;strong&gt;Springing Assault&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+): this lets
them jump 4 squares, make a gythka attack, then jump another 3 and make another
gythka attack. None of this movement provokes opportunity attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter they can perform a &lt;strong&gt;Mind Wrench&lt;/strong&gt;, attacking the Will of all
enemies in a Close Burst 2. On a hit this deals psychic damage and marks for a
turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When an adjacent marked enemy moves, shifts, or makes an attack that doesn’t
target the warrior, it can cause a &lt;strong&gt;Spasm&lt;/strong&gt; as an interrupt. This is an attack
against Will that does psychic damage on a hit, knocks the target prone, and
slows them until the end of the warrior’s next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three stat blocks combined with the Ambusher, Scout, and Sand Talker from
the MM3 will let you build a large variety of thri-kreen encounters. They can
also be part of “found clutches”, AKA Mixed Groups of Humanoids, voluntarily or
not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I note that the MM3 Thri-Kreen are described as using “spears” and “shuriken”,
which clearly correspond to the gythkas and chatkchas used by these ones. A
simple find-and-replace of the names should work, as there is no mechanical
difference between them in the stat blocks themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Thrax</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-thrax.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A thrax holding what remains of his latest victim.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there was a town named Gerot at the foot of a mountain near the
city-state of Raam. Its people were great warriors, but also haugthy. When the
Sorcerer Queen Abalach-Re sent them an offer of alliance in exchange for them
joining Raam’s legions, they signaled their refusal by killing the envoys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abalach-Re was obviously very angry at this, so she double-cursed the people of
Gerot: they would be afflicted with an unquenchable thirst &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; pure water
would become like a poison to them. In short order, the entire town was
dead. The bit the queen hadn’t predicted was that the dead of Gerot would rise
again, as the first thraxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thrax is a water vampire. Still afflicted by the sorcerous curse, it suffers
from constant, unquenchable thirst, which it tries to satisfy by draining the
fluids from the flesh of the living. Thrax victims become desiccated husks, and
it’s said to be an agonizing death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a standard D&amp;amp;D vampire, a thrax seems to retain the mind and personality
it had in life. This means they’re even more miserable, tormented not just by
their cursed thirst but also by their regret at having to feed. Prime personal
horror material there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, we’re talking about the thraxes that seek revenge on
Abalach-Re by haunting Raam and drinking her supporters dry. I imagine those are
a fair bit less conflicted than the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thraxes can drain fluids through skin contact, and they also have this trick
where they can cause a victim’s fluids to all move close to the skin, making the
victim bloated and easier to drain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only get a single stat block here, so let’s get right to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thrax&quot;&gt;Thrax&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thrax shown here is Medium Natural Humanoid (undead) and a Level 11 Lurker
with 88 HP, putting it about on par with the traditional vampires from the
Monster Vault. It has darkvision, Resist 10 Necrotic, and Vulnerable 5
Radiant. Unlike a lot of other undead, it has no special resistance against
poison and disease. And unlike a traditional vampire, it is not vulnerable to
natural sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thraxes are surrounded by &lt;strong&gt;Roiling Shadows&lt;/strong&gt; which give them +2 to defenses
against ranged attacks, and their &lt;strong&gt;Clinging Grasp&lt;/strong&gt; makes them insubstantial
and immune to forced movement while they have a creature grabbed. This takes
away the PC’s easiest tactic for making them let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is the &lt;strong&gt;Grasp of the Dead&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals necrotic damage. If
the thrax has combat advantage, a hit also grabs the victim, which has a -5
penalty to escape rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once it has a creature grabbed, the thrax can proceed to &lt;strong&gt;Drain Fluids&lt;/strong&gt;, which
deals heavy necrotic damage, heals the thrax for 10 HP, and ends the grab. If the
attack bloodies the target, they also fall unconscious (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thrax can also attack with &lt;strong&gt;Flesh Bloat&lt;/strong&gt;, the “trick” mentioned
above. This is an at-will melee attack that deals a bit more necrotic damage
than the Grasp, and also dazes and slows the target (save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Standard tactics for a thrax will likely be to bloat their intended victim, grab
them with Grasp of the Dead, and then Drain Fluids, repeating as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water vampires feel much more appropriate for Dark Sun than the traditional
blood kind. I’m guessing all the traditional vampires in Athas must have melted
in the heat from all those layers they tend to wear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thraxes will probably only join up with other thraxes, and a fight against five
of them will be nightmarish for the party. You could also mix it up with other
relatively “dry” undead types. Maybe angry ghosts, or the animated corpses of
their dried-out victims.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Tembo</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-tembo.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A tembo, who looks like a giant scaled rat with sabertooth fangs.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our previous entry was kind of vague about whether tareks were a product of
the genocidal “Cleansing Wars” in Athas’ distant past, this one is pretty
categorical. Tembos are bioengineered terror weapons, created using magic most
foul for the purposes of facilitating genocide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Champions” of that time (which unknown to most are the sorcerer-kings of
today) created them to sneak upon the homes of their opponents, and take from
them those they loved most. In addition to their stealthy forms and sharp fangs,
they received a limited ability to blend with shadows, the power to bite
someone in the soul, and a sophisticated intellect that is entirely devoted to
finding new ways of fulfilling their purpose in crueler ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have survived as a species to this day, roaming mainly through the western
wastelands of the Tyr region, but they have been sighted elsewhere too. There’s
no one to give them specific targets any more, so they choose their victims
themselves, for food and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirmation that a tembo is targetting a settlement is one of the only things
that will immediately end any infighting and other disagreements and make its
whole population unite against the threat. Everyone hates these things more than
they hate each other, which is saying something in Athas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How exactly these attacks happen vary with the creature’s whims, as well as with
what it judges to be the most effective tactic for a given situation. Sometimes
they stay hidden and let their deadly magical aura slowly kill the population,
and sometimes they tear people apart in broad daylight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tembos are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts and Level 6 Solo Skirmishers with 280
HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;Killing Presence&lt;/strong&gt; acts as an aura (2) that deals 5 necrotic damage
to anyone who starts their turn inside. When the tembo is bloodied, its &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt;
aura kicks in. &lt;strong&gt;Tainted Wounds&lt;/strong&gt; (aura 5) halves any HP recovery from healing
effects for those inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a solo, the tembo has &lt;strong&gt;Double Actions&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning it rolls initiative twice
and takes full turns in both counts. And finally, it’s &lt;strong&gt;Immovable&lt;/strong&gt;, being
completely immune to any kind of forced movement, and getting a free save
against being knocked prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monster’s main attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; that damages, inflicts a -2 attack
penalty for a turn, and serves as a carrier for the &lt;strong&gt;Unspeakable Violation&lt;/strong&gt;
secondary attack. This targets Fortitude, and on a hit eats a healing surge and
doubles the damage from Killing Presence against that target for a
turn. Fortunately, it has Recharge 6+, so it doesn’t happen with every bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its attack it’s likely to use the most is a &lt;strong&gt;Raking Assault&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals the
same damage as the bite then lets the Tembo shift 4 squares and use the bite. So
that’s two or three attacks for the price of one, with the creature being able
to do this two times per round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its camouflage powers take two forms: &lt;strong&gt;Blending&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) is a move action
that makes the tembo invisible for a turn or until its next attack. And &lt;strong&gt;Shadow
Evasion&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge when first bloodied) is a reaction that triggers when it’s
hit by a melee or ranged attack, letting it shift 4 squares and become
insubstantial for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having two full turns per round can actually make Blending last even less, so
it’s not something a tembo will use to lie in wait for a long time. It will
instead rely on mundane stealth for this. Then it will charge in, use as many
Raking Assault flurries as it can, and combine Shadow Evasion with Blending to
escape from sight, only coming back to attack when its enemies’ guards are
down. Its ability to delete healing surges makes such long-term harassment
tactics even more effective, since it will obviously attack you in your sleep
and stop you from taking a long rest. Fighting the creature to the finish
in a single encounter will require preventing its escape somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a horrible, horrible monster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tembos are almost always found alone. As mentioned above, everyone hates these
things. They will sometimes join together in small packs, but these end up
breaking apart pretty soon because they suck at organizing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re back to using the s-word for this one, though it only appears once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the book, legends tell that “an entity of mad destruction” created
the tareks in the very distant past to serve as “instruments of murder”. I guess
this means that they were created as bioweapons for the genocidal wars of the
Red Age, which would explain why they’re so strong and tough. In any case, their
earth priests helped them revolt against their masters and attain independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our narrative present, tareks live in isolated communities in Athas’ hilly
and moutainous regions. They’re intensely isolationist and xenophobic, so most
of the contact they have with other humanoids is when they raid any of their
communities that might be located too near to tarek territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they seemingly hate everyone, they are “sworn enemies of the gith”. Like
all particularly strong humanoid species, they’re popular targets for slavers
because they do well at the arena. It’s no wonder most revolts in Athas seem to
start there…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tareks are Medium Natural Humanoids with a ground speed of 6. Their signature
trait is &lt;strong&gt;Deathless Warrior&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them roll a save when they hit 0
HP. If they pass, they only drop at the end of their next turn, and can act
normally until them. They speak Common and Giant, and are Unaligned by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book recommends adding additional varieties of tarek by taking orc stat
blocks and replacing their bonus charge speed and Warrior’s Surge with Deathless
Warrior. So I guess they’re explicitly Darker and Sunnier orcs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tarek-raider&quot;&gt;Tarek Raider&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raiders are Level 3 Soldiers with 49 HP. They’re disciplined and try to stick
together in a fight even if scattered by forced movement. Their &lt;strong&gt;Tarek Squad
Tactics&lt;/strong&gt; give them Combat Advantage against anyone adjacent to at least one
other Tarek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A raider is usually armed with a &lt;strong&gt;Bone Heartpick&lt;/strong&gt; whose attacks damage, slide
1 square, and mark for a turn on a hit. If someone decides to ignore the mark,
their &lt;strong&gt;Dangerous Aggression&lt;/strong&gt; gives them a free attack against the offender,
and if that hits the target is also immobilized (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tarek-earth-shaman&quot;&gt;Tarek Earth Shaman&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earth shamans are Level 4 Controllers with the Leader tag. They fight much like
Earthbenders from the Avatar shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their melee attacks use &lt;strong&gt;Fists of Stone&lt;/strong&gt; which target Fortitude, damage on a
hit and slide 3 squares as an effect. They can also use a spell named
&lt;strong&gt;Clutching Stone&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 3 vs. Fort, recharge 5+) that does the same
damage, knocks targets prone, and restrains them (save ends). And their ultimate
technique is &lt;strong&gt;Tide of Stone&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Ref, recharges when first
bloodied), which deals heavy damage and knocks prone on a hit. Allies caught in
the blast can instead shift 3 squares as an effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tareks will only buddy up with other tareks and whatever domesticated beasts
they might train. You will only find them in Mixed Groups of People if they’re
enslaved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seen above, they like to stick close to each other in fights, and the book
also mentions they like the same focused fire tactics that tend to be described
as optimal for PCs. In other words, if they can they’ll pick a particularly
vulnerable target and focus their attacks there until the target is dead before
moving on to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Ssurran</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-ssurran.png&quot;/&gt;

    on a desert ridge and armed with a bone pick.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe this entry confirms that different monster entries in the Catalog are
written by different authors, because its description of Athasian lizardfolk is
as even-handed and respectful as the one for muls was racist, and they’re not
even playable by default!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, ssurrans are Athasian lizardfolk. They’re as adapted to the
desert wastes as their relatives from other worlds are to swamps. Like all other
humanoids in Athas, their daily goal is survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ssurrans (also known as “sandscale lizardfolk”) organize in nomadic tribes made
up of several family groups and a number of reptilian beasts that serve the
usual purposes from hauling cargo to helping in fights. They hunt, forage, and
sometimes raid while on the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ssurran raids on settled communities are downright merciful when compared to
most others described so far. They allow the inhabitants to flee and only kill
those who try to fight back. Then they steal every usable good they can carry
and move away, taking care to erase their tracks and lay some false trails to
deter pursuers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ssurrans are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Reptile and Lizardfolk tags. They
have a ground speed of 6 with Earth Walk, and speak Draconic. While this entry
only has two stat blocks, it does outright say that you can take any standard
lizardfolk from other books and replace Swamp Walk with Earth Walk to get a
sandscale version. You can also apply one of the monster themes found in the
back half of the book (and which we’ll see eventually).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ssurran-shaman&quot;&gt;Ssurran Shaman&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandscales have a long tradition of worshipping the sun and related primal
spirits. A shaman’s duties also include preserving their tribe’s oral history
and culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your typical ssurran shaman is a Level 3 Controller with 47 HP. They fight with
a Spear that damages and pushes 1 square on a hit, and can cast at-will &lt;strong&gt;Sun
Curses&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 5 vs. Reflex) that deal fire damage and daze for a turn. Their
&lt;strong&gt;Treacherous Spirit&lt;/strong&gt; spell (ranged 5 vs. Will, recharge on a miss) dominates
the target (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite their low-level, ssurran shamans are pretty dangerous and are likely to
be an unfortunate PC party’s first introduction to the Dazed and Dominated
conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ssurran-hunter&quot;&gt;Ssurran Hunter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These make up the bulk of any ssurran scout, hunting, or raiding party. They’re
Level 4 Minion Skirmishers that fight with &lt;strong&gt;picks&lt;/strong&gt; that deal a little extra
damage to enemies granting Combat Advantage. If an enemy hits one of their
adjacent allies, the hunter can use &lt;strong&gt;Sidestep&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction to shift 1
square.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ssurran tribes tend to stick together. Lone lizardfolk will either be outcasts,
or the last survivors of their tribes. Sometimes, slavers kidnap their young for
sale as “exotic merchandise”, so they might be found among enslaved guards or
gladiators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the way they were described in the book - my text here is barely
paraphrased. Simply by describing these lizardfolk as &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, it already
allows me to imagine a bunch of situations where they’re potential oposition but
where things can still be solved by means other than murder. They also make
great potential allies in many other scenarios, because even when a group of
ssurrans is not nice there will likely be someone much worse nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let&apos;s Read the 4e Dark Sun Creature Catalog: Spider</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-dscc-crystal-spider.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    A large spider made of translucent crystal.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/dscc/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark Sun is still a D&amp;amp;D setting. Therefore it needs giant spiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athasian giant spiders behave much like their kin from other worlds. They prefer
locations that afford them plenty of hiding and ambush spots like caves, deep
valleys, and so on. While neither of the varieties presented here can spin webs
fast enought to do so during combat, they still might cover entire chasms or
large passages in them as they wait for more prey to wander by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crystal-spider&quot;&gt;Crystal Spider&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the prettiest monsters in the Tablelands, its carapace is made of actual
crystal. Aside from the usual venomous bite and their razor-sharp appendages,
crystal spiders also have smome power over light and are capable of radiant
attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crystal Spiders are Large Natural Beasts and Level 4 Lurkers with 39 HP. Their
ground and Spider Climb speeds are both 8, and they have Tremorsense 10 to
detect people touching their webs. Their carapace makes gives them Resist 5
Radiant, but also Vulnerable 5 Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also gives them the &lt;strong&gt;Gleaming Carapace&lt;/strong&gt; trait, which gives them concealment
until the end of their next turn any time they move more than 5 squares in the
same action. I guess glare is a major problem with fighting crystal spiders on
their home turf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is a decently damaging &lt;strong&gt;Razor Leg&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 2), and they can
use a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 1 vs. Fort) against a target that cannot see them, dealing
both immediate and 10 ongoing poison damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crystal spiders could achieve that unseen state by moving more than 5 squares
and hiding, but they have a couple of shortcuts in the form of their
light-bending powers. &lt;strong&gt;Radiant Agony&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 2 vs. Fort) pushes its
targets 3 squares and blinds them for a turn, recharging whenever no one is
blinded or when the spider hits with its bite. &lt;strong&gt;Brilliant Ray&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10
vs. Ref, recharge 5+) does a good chunk of radiant damage and blinds for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;crystalline-web&quot;&gt;Crystalline Web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any place where crystal spiders hunt will be filled with these razor sharp
traps. They’re statted up as Level 4 Obstacles, each consisting of a patch of
webbing 4x4 squares in size, stretched between two surfaces. They’re
semi-transparent and require a DC 14 Perception check to notice in bright light,
or 19 in dim light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a character enters a web square, the web attacks their Reflex, doing
immediate and ongoing 5 physical damage on a hit (save ends). Hit or miss, the
target’s movement ends and it gets pushed back to the last square it occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A character can use Acrobatics (DC 14) to move through a webbed square, or they
can attack the web and deplete its 25 HP to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An elite version of this trap has 50 HP instead, and deals increased damage when
it catches someone. In either case, good luck dodging these in dim light or
while blinded by the crystal spiders who made them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book doesn’t explicily state it, but I would say crystal spiders should be
immune to the effects of their own webs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;white-widow&quot;&gt;White Widow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White Widows are a bigger, stronger, and &lt;em&gt;stealthier&lt;/em&gt; relative of the crystal
spider. While they lack the ability to fire lasers, they still have some control
over light and like to blind their prey. They’re Huge Natural Beasts and Level
15 Lurkers with 110 HP, resist 10 poison and radiant, and Vulnerable 10
thunder. Their speed and senses are the same as a crystal spider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason white widows like to blind their prey is that they deal 15 ongoing
“poison and radiant” damage (save ends) when they hit blinded targets with any
attack. Yes, this means their venom is deadly even to things that are normally
resistant or immune to poison. This trait is named &lt;strong&gt;Combat Advantage&lt;/strong&gt; but
that name is misleading, as it only grants its benefit against &lt;em&gt;blinded&lt;/em&gt;
targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spider’s &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; is a basic attack that also deals “poison and radiant”
damage, but it’s not going to be used on its own unless conditions are
right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of biting it can turtle up and use its &lt;strong&gt;Reflective Defense&lt;/strong&gt;, which
gives it a +5 bonus to all defenses for a turn and blinds anyone who misses them
with an attack during that time. The &lt;strong&gt;Scuttling Attack&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver (recharge 5+)
lets it shift half its speed, bite someone, and shift the other half.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hit by a fire, radiant or lightning attack (in other words, anything shiny)
the spider can react with the &lt;strong&gt;Venomous Dawn&lt;/strong&gt; attack, enhancing and reflecting
that light back at its attackers. This is a Close Burst 5 vs. Reflex, deals
radiant damage, and blinds (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;widows-web&quot;&gt;Widow’s Web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any battle against white widows will happen in a place filled with
these. They’re not sharp like a crystal spider’s, but they’re still quite
dangerous as Level 15 Obstacle traps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White widow web patches are 10x10 squares in size and require a DC 22 Perception
check to notice in dim light, but are automatically visible in bright
light. The web attacks the Reflex of anyone who enters one of its squares, and
restrains on a hit (save ends). Webbed squares are also difficult terrain to
anyone without the Spider Climb ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Characters can avoid the trap by leaping over webbed terrain, or destroy the web
by dealing 40 HP of damage to it. An elite version has double the HP and can
take two opportunity attacks per turn, which is useful in case two or more
targets get pushed into it in the same action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll mostly commonly be meeting these spiders singly or in pairs, with the
rest of the encounter balance being made up of web patches. They can appear
anywhere you would expect to find the standard varieties of D&amp;amp;D giant spider,
which also exist in Athas because why wouldn’t they?&lt;/p&gt;
