&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creature first appeared as an “Ultrodaemon” in AD&amp;amp;D, as part of the effort
to give every alignment its own brand of outsider. In 4e, daemons lost an “a”
and became demons. We already saw some of them in the readings of earlier books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultrodemons are somewhat atypical among demons because they’re more about greed
than about cruelty for cruelty’s sake. They enjoy carnage and torture as much as
the next demon, but their real passion is material wealth. They command armies
of mezzodemons and nycademons, sell their mercenary services for ruinous prices,
and loot as much as they can during these operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultrodemons and their underlings can be found in a wide variety of places,
either under contract to some other villain, or working independently. They’re
very rarely loyal to their employers, though, and will turn on them as soon it
looks more profitable than fulfilling the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry only has a single stat block, for an &lt;strong&gt;Ultrodemon Schemer&lt;/strong&gt;. This is
a manipulative villain who will likely only fight the PCs in a battlefield of
its own choosing and backed up by a large number of demon allies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a Medium Elemental Humanoid with the Demon tag, and a Level 22 Controller
(Leader) with 205 HP. It has a ground speed of 7 with Phasing, which allows it
to walk through walls. It also has Blindsight with range 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schemer wields a &lt;strong&gt;longsword&lt;/strong&gt; whose attacks deal physical damage and daze
for a turn on a hit. It can also use magic to shoot &lt;strong&gt;Fiery Rays&lt;/strong&gt; that deal
fire damage. Its command ability is represented by the &lt;strong&gt;Demonic Authority&lt;/strong&gt;
power, which allows each ally adjacent to the schemer to make a melee basic
attack with combat advantage as a free action. This recharges when the demon is
first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To complement its sword, combat magic, and command ability, the schemer also has
a few nasty mind tricks it can use as minor actions. The first is &lt;strong&gt;Hypnotic
Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+) immobilizes on a hit, and has an effect that prohibits the
target from attacking the schemer for a turn. “Effects” in 4e parlance are
things that happen even on a miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other trick is &lt;strong&gt;Treacherous Gaze&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 6+), which dominates for a
turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As its triggered actions, the schemer has a middling version of Variable
Resistance, which gives Resistance 20 but only works once per encounter. It also
has &lt;strong&gt;Self-Preservation&lt;/strong&gt;, which triggers when an enemy bloodies it. It causes
the schemer to teleport and swap places with an ally within 10 squares, and
gives the ally a chance to make a free basic attack against the triggering
enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this points to a demon who wants to be close to Team Monster’s
skirmishers and assassins, and who will accompany them to try to get around the
party’s front line. It things become too hot, it will bring in a soldier or
brute from its own front line to spice things up while it flees to safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remain a big fan of folding daemons into demons! Mechanically, ultros work
well as “sneaky leaders”, which isn’t a combination you see very often.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Star Wars RPGs and The Force: A Thought</title>
        <description>&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t part of a series or anything, but it’s a random though I’ve been
having and I feel it’s worth turning into a post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-thought&quot;&gt;The Thought&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I ever to a Star Wars adaptation, it’s going to be one where everybody is
Force-sensitive. Let’s do away with the absolutist “magic/no-magic” divide
inspired by D&amp;amp;D that all the official RPGs so far have used. If the Force is
described in the source material as being in everyone, then it should &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; in in
everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players would not be forced to play Jedi - rather, the badassitude of their PCs
would be explained by their connection to the Force. No more of that nonsense
about how “you can still be cool even though you’re blind to the Force”. No,
you’re cool because you opened yourself to it. It’s everywhere, and getting past
a certain threshold of skill at any endeavor means becoming attuned to the
Force. By definition, any character who is PC material in the sort of heroic
story Star Wars favors is past that threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like, yeah, you can still be a Jedi who throws stuff around telekinetically and
parries blaster bolts with a lightsaber, but you can also be an amazing
gunfighter from the slums of Coruscant who can &lt;em&gt;dodge&lt;/em&gt; blasters, react to stuff
before it happens, and make shots that ricochet from five different surfaces
before hitting some impossibly small target. And maybe both of you can jump
really high because that’s always useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a set of Force-based mechanics that all PCs gets access to, even if they
have the least mystical background possible. They can use it to perform
impossible feats of skill and luck. They can have intuitions and
premonitions. Maybe they can study a mystical tradition to do more overtly
supernatural stuff, but that’s not required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe one of the reasons the Dark Side and the Empire are evil is that
they’re the ones who believe that only a select few elites should be given
access to the Force.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Demon, Quasit</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-demon-quasit.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe quasits have been around since AD&amp;amp;D 1st Edition, and they’ve
re-appeared in every edition since. This is where they enter 4e.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when they first appeared, quasits were simply the demon equivalent of
Imps: tiny, winged, and tricksy. The only reason they were a different creature
at all is was because of the game’s insistence that demons and devils are
completely different creature types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons Fourth Edition, quasits are… the demon equivalent of
&lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2019/11/30/imp.html&quot;&gt;Imps&lt;/a&gt;. Still tiny, still tricksy, they’re extremely easy to summon as
familiars and live to tempt their masters into committing ever more horrible
acts of destruction. When one of these masters die, the quasit captures their
soul and takes it to its &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; master, usually a demon lord. Demons don’t need
souls, but I guess they’re tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quasits are usually encountered with whatever dupes they’ve managed to tempt
this time or with other, bigger, demons. Minions might include people of any
sapient species, with or without a spellcaster. They also like
arcanians. Quasits tend to remain invisible for as long as possible and let the
others do most of the work for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quasits are Tiny Elemental Humanoids with the Demon tag. They’re a bit stronger
than imps by default, being Level 7 Controllers with 75 HP. They have darkvision
and a fantastic ground speed of 8, though they’re not winged and can’t fly in
this edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re unusual among demons in that most of their attacks have a trickery and
temptation theme, to an even greater extend than an imp. This starts with their
&lt;strong&gt;Tempter’s Influence&lt;/strong&gt; aura (2), which inflicts a -2 penalty to saves on
enemies caught inside. They can also become &lt;strong&gt;Invisible&lt;/strong&gt; at will with a minor
action (1/round), and stay in this state until they make an attack roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is a Reach 0 venomous &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;, which does physical damage
and forces the target to grant combat advantage (save ends). Reach 0 means they
need to enter the target’s square, which they can do because they’re Tiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their other attack is &lt;strong&gt;Evil Temptation&lt;/strong&gt;, a mind-affecting spell that targets
Will and affects enemies in a Close Blast 3. This is another at-will minor
action (1/round), and though it does no damage it dazes (save ends). The
“temptation” here is that victims can choose to end the effect early by making
an attack against one of their allies!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess quasits aren’t just demonic imps in 4e. They’re also doing some of
the succubus’ job now that she left to become a devil. PCs affected by Evil
Temptation are likely to try to shrug it off with saves at first, but if they
have a streak of unlucky rolls that friendly fire incident is going to start
feeling mighty attractive. Daze is such a serious condition after all…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a genuine temptation mechanic! I think I only saw one other instance of
this, for the MM2’s &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2021/07/11/devils-02.html&quot;&gt;Misfortune Devils&lt;/a&gt;. Not even succubi themselves have
temptation mechanics, since their powers and “lore baggage” end up making them
better for &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2019/12/15/succubus.html&quot;&gt;making PCs run away&lt;/a&gt;. This is an at-will Blast attack, so you’ll
likely have &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; PCs affected by the power at any one time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quasits should fight by alternating Evil Temptation and Invisibility, and should
hang around close to “tempted” PCs while invisible to make their saves
harder. While this is happening, the quasit’s larger allies are going to have a
field day with all those dazed heroes. Brutes and artillery work well here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PC tactics when fighting a group containing a quasit are very clear: crush it
&lt;em&gt;as soon as possible&lt;/em&gt;. Have your party’s scouts use their high Perception to
find the invisible little bugger and smite him with close or area attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Demon, Nafelshnee</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember seeing these things in 3e, and they probably date from earlier. My
memory of them is not very detailed because I had no patience for reading
page-long lists of spell-like abilities, which were the style of the time for
epic demons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nafelshnees are something of a rarity in the Abyss: demons with a
&lt;em&gt;civilization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These demons hail from the 400th layer of the Abyss, known as the Woeful
Escarand. In the distant past, this layer was ruled by a demon lord named
Tantagaras, a corpulent beast who sired many lesser demons made in his
image. These were known as his Waddling Legions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tantagaras took part in Tharizdun’s uprising against the gods, during which he
entered a duel with Kord. Kord killed him, and the Waddling Legions brought his
corpse back to the Woeful Escarand. They paid their respects by devouring the
corpse, which causes fragments of Tantagaras’ essence to transfer to them and
make them a lot smarter and more ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course resulted in a long and bloody demon civil war, which in turn
ended when six of the most powerful nafelshnees got together and named
themselves the rulers of the 400th layer. Known as the Lords of Woe, they carved
the layer into a sprawling feudal realm, each of them sitting at the top of a
large hierarchy of vassals that rule their own fiefs as they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, these lords and ladies exhausted all the resources of their abyssal
layer, because demons might be able to build a society but they can’t make it
sustainable. So now they make deals with “foreign” demon lords, offering their
services in exchange for slaves, materials, food, and treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your typical nafelshnee divides people into three groups: “food”, “tools” and
“masters”. The first group includes almost everyone weaker than themselves, from
animals to humanoids to lesser demons. They never negotiate with food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second group includes those who aren’t tasty enough to eat, like insects,
spiders, immortals, powerful elementals and, amusingly enough, gnomes. They’ll
try to bully the weaker “tools” into servitude, and might try to manipulate the
stronger ones, but I guess they might just try to kill them without eating if
talks break down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last group is very small and consists of the mightiest demons, demon lords,
and efreets. With these, their usually arrogant behavior melts into a wheedling
servitude worthy of Starscream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nafelshnees are Huge Elemental Humanoids with the Demon tag, Darkvision, and a
ground speed of 6. They can also fly with a speed of 4 (clumsy). They have very
good Variable Resistance (20). We get two stat blocks for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nafelshnee-swine-guard&quot;&gt;Nafelshnee Swine Guard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most nafelshnees fit this profile, and have a role roughly equivalent to that of
a landless knight in their society. They serve more powerful lords and hire
themselves out as mercenaries, and have actually managed to get a good
reputation for being both resilient and obedient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swine Guards are Level 20 Brutes with 237 HP. They wield giant Reach 3
&lt;strong&gt;halberds&lt;/strong&gt; that do solid physical damage and push the target 2 squares on a
hit. If someone manages to get closer they can try to take a &lt;strong&gt;Noisome Bite&lt;/strong&gt;
out of the enemy, which does slightly less damage but inflicts ongoing 10 poison
damage (swine guards never brush their teeth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their variable resistance can change twice per encounter, and when they’re first
bloodied they immediately use a power called &lt;strong&gt;Shattered Minds&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a
Close Burst 3 that targets enemies’ Will. On a hit it does psychic damage and
dazes (save ends). If the first save fails, the demon can slide the victim 3
squares, and the daze worsens to a stun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes swine guards the kind of brute who wants the PCs to surround them and
beat them up a bit. The halberd’s push rider means they can also herd the PCs
towards other monsters as this happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nafelshnee-tyrant&quot;&gt;Nafelshnee Tyrant&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the lords and ladies of the Woeful Escarand. They’re powerful
magicians with great knowledge of rituals and access to libraries of forbidden
lore. They are willing to part with ritual scrolls and bits of relevant
information in exchange for suitable tribute, which usually consists of food
(the book mentions “a brace of plump halflings” as an example). In a fight, they
like to fling destructive magic while sitting on their thrones, though they can
move at standard nafelshnee speeds if forced to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyrants are Level 23 Controllers with 215 HP. Their reach 3 &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; slide the
target 3 squares on a hit, and their basic ranged attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Black
Lightning&lt;/strong&gt; spell that does necrotic damage and makes the victim vulnerable 15
to psychic damage for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their psychic attack is &lt;strong&gt;Unholy Whispers&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), a fireball sized area
burst that does psychic damage and dazes (save ends). A miss still does half
damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, they can curse enemies with a &lt;strong&gt;Vile Glare&lt;/strong&gt;, a non-damaging
attack that targets Will and makes it so the target is only able to use basic
attacks (save ends). It recharges every time a target fails a save against the
effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I say this all the time, but I really love these more focused fiend stat
blocks. Earlier editions just had long lists of spell-like abilities and
memorized spells for each demon, so I tended to just skip over their
descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyrants obviously pair really well with other monsters that can deal psychic
damage. A simple but flavorful and effective encounter might be a pair of
happily married nafelshnee tyrants and their swine guard retinue. Two tyrants
means you can assemble the Black Lightning + Unholy Whispers combo much quicker.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Demon, Molydeus</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-demon-molydeus.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Tharizdun first planted the cosmic Seed of Evil in the Elemental Chaos, he
ordered his seven most powerful angels to stand guard over it. The angels’ oaths
and sense of duty compelled them to obey. However, they all had some serious
personal misgivings about this whole “corrupt and destroy the universe”
business, so they were reluctant guardians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the seed inevitably corrupted them, it seized on this reluctance and turned
the seven into two-headed Molydeus demons. They have a wolf’s head symbolizing
their fierceness, and a snake’s head symbolizing their uncertain loyalty. They
also carry the same axes they wielded as angels, which in a surprising twist
contain a bit of the unspoiled light of creation. The demons are bound to their
weapons - when one dies, the axe dissolves into sludge. If it’s stolen or lost,
the molydeus will not rest until it has been recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seed of evil hasn’t needed guarding for a long time now, and the molydeus
have scattered. They wander the Abyss alone, or followed by small retinues of
other epic-level demons. They usually prefer Mariliths, but will also work with
Balors or Klurichirs. Very rarely you’ll find one of them doing a demon lord’s
dirty work, but these relationships rarely last long. I mean, if anyone is
really at an “almost demon lord” level of power it’s the molydeus, so I guess
they don’t like being the junior partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s only one stat block in this entry, which is okay because there are only
seven molydeus demons in all the universe. They’re Large Elemental Humanoids
with the Demon tag, and Level 29 Elite Soldiers with 544 HP. Stronger than
balors and pit fiends, and on par with primordial colossi. They have Blindsight
5, a ground speed of 8, and are immune to fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, molydeus share some similarities with Ettins, due to their two
heads. They have &lt;strong&gt;All-Around Vision&lt;/strong&gt; and therefore can’t be flanked; &lt;strong&gt;Double
Actions&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to roll Initiative twice and take two full turns per
round; and &lt;strong&gt;Dual Brain&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to automatically save against dazing,
stunning or charm effects at the beginning of each of their turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all demons, the molydeus has &lt;strong&gt;Variable Resistance&lt;/strong&gt;, and since it’s epic
the trait is at its most powerful: 30 resistance to an element, switchable 3
times per encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a fight, it’ll probably open up with its &lt;strong&gt;Dread Word&lt;/strong&gt; encounter power, a
fear attack that targets Will in a Close Burst 5, affecting only enemies. A hit
dazes them (save ends); a miss slows them and inflicts a -2 attack penalty (save
ends both). If it needs to mark someone, it will attack with its Reach 2
&lt;strong&gt;axe&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a pretty beefy attack already. Otherwise it will alternate
between &lt;strong&gt;Wolf Bites&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Snake Bites&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolf bites are Reach 2 do about as much damage as the axe and slide the target 6
squares to a square adjacent to the demon. Snake Bites are weaker, but have
Reach 3, make the target grant combat advantage, and inflict 20 ongoing poison
damage (save ends both). Both the axe and the bites count as basic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wolf bite is an excellent positioning tool, so I guess the demon might use
if a few times to set the party up for the Dread Word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;em&gt;here’s&lt;/em&gt; some proper epic demon lore! Mechanically, it has a suite of
attacks that’s both thematic and varied, and indeed pairs well with mariliths
and klurichirs. The klurichir stat block works better as a demon created to
serve the molydeus than as a demon lord contender itself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Demon, Maw</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn’t much to a maw demon. It’s a huge fanged mouth with some extra bits
attached so it can move to wherever the food is. While most other demons are
motivated by rage, hatred, or ruinous ambition, these things just want to
eat. They’re a bit like sharks, drawn to the smell of blood, and will prioritize
an easy meal over a fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maw demons are still demons, so they prefer their meals bloody and still
twitching. If there are none already in that state, they’ll advance on the
nearest living creature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The typical maw demon is rather weak as far as demons go, though it still
presents a big threat to non-combatants. Those who manage to live longer become
much stronger and hungrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maw demons are sapient, but just barely. They don’t really form alliances, but
stronger demons can bully them into servitude, and even amateur demonologists
might be able to summon and bind one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;maw-demon&quot;&gt;Maw Demon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Medium Elemental Humanoid with the Demon tag. It’s a Level 2 Brute
with 42 HP, darkvision, and a speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demon’s &lt;strong&gt;snapping jaws&lt;/strong&gt; act like an aura (1) that make all enemies inside
grant combat advantage. Its basic attack is obviously a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;. It can use a
move action to perform a &lt;strong&gt;Ravenous Advance&lt;/strong&gt; and shift 5 squares to end
adjacent to a bloodied enemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as a demon, it has &lt;strong&gt;Variable Resistance&lt;/strong&gt; and can switch it once per
encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;greater-maw-demon&quot;&gt;Greater Maw Demon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is mostly just a leveled-up maw demon. It’s a Level 16 Brute with 187 HP
and correspondingly bigger numbers. Its variable resistance works twice per
encounter, and  it has a new hability: &lt;strong&gt;Howling Hunger&lt;/strong&gt; targets Will, hits a
Close Burst 3, does thunder damage, and knocks targets prone. It can only be
used when the demon is bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just another demonic brute. Its low level makes it an interesting variation on
the MM2 dretches, with better math. Their most interesting power is actually the
Snapping Jaws aura, which makes them pair really well with ranged monsters that
benefit from combat advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the MM2 reading on the RPG.net forum, someone mentioned that these things
could be abyssal xorns, and it fits really well with their mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: A Note on Fiends</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post doesn’t correspond to an entry in the book, but I figured I’d write it
to explain a few important differences in organization between the MM3 and its
predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two Monster Manuals had huge multi-monster entries for the “Three
Dees”: Demons, Devils, and Dragons. These entries included some general lore
that applied to all of them, and a huge number of individual stat blocks with
their own bits of lore. They were a real chore to cover!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragons are still like that, because we’re going to be looking at a whole new
dragon sub-category here. But the fiends (demons and devils) are organized
differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the third main monster book in the edition. Pretty much everything that
needed to be said about general demon and devil lore has already been said in
the previous books, and likely on a few extra supplements that came out
alongside them. So the demons and devils in this book are all in their own
individual entries labeled as “Demon, X” and “Devil, Y”. That’s going to make
them much easier to cover!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one demon we already covered in the past, the Babau, and for that one
I’m just going to refer you to the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2019/11/07/babau.html&quot;&gt;original post&lt;/a&gt; I made a while back. I
believe every other demon and devil here is new to the Let’s Read project, so
I’ll cover one entry per post on them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Demon, Klurichir</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Abyss is home to several powerful demon lords, each of whom has their own
ruinous designs on the rest of the universe and is building an army to enact
those designs. Yet these armies rarely seem to leave the Abyss to start their
invasions. One of the reasons for this is that the demon lords hate each other
as much as they hate everything else, and spend much of their time locked in
eternal bloody warfare. Another one is that you have huge hordes of “unclaimed
demons” who prefer to pursue their own personal goals instead of organizing into
a large force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it looks like the seed of cosmic evil at the bottom of the Abyss has had
enough of this lack of focus, so it started producing a special brand of demon
from pure elemental evil energy and sending them to the upper layers to clean
house. These are the klurichirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every klurichir is a contender for the rank of demon lord, and has a real shot
at it given enough time. They differ from the existing demon lords in that they
were never primordials, but were instead born as demons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These demons are quick to take control of those unclaimed hordes, and use them
to shake things up in the Abyss. They do this by throwing them against the
forces of the incumbent demon lords as they fight each other. They surround
themselves with other epic-tier officers like balors and nafelshnees, and spend
the lives of their lesser underlings freely because there are always more where
those came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only get a single stat block for klurichirs. They’re Huge Elemental Humanoids
with the Demon tag, and Level 28 Soldiers with 258 HP. They have Blindsight 5,
and are immune to fear. Their ground speed is 8, and they fly at speed 12 with
clumsy maneuverability, meaning they fight on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klurichirs project a &lt;strong&gt;Malign Influence&lt;/strong&gt; aura (2) that prevents enemies inside
from regaining HP by any means. They fight with gigantic Reach 3 &lt;strong&gt;axes&lt;/strong&gt; that
do more damage when the demon is bloodied and mark for a turn. They can make
occasional &lt;strong&gt;Savage Hew&lt;/strong&gt; attacks (recharge 5+) that hit everyone in a Close
Burst 3 for the same damage and effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a marked enemy moves, the klurichir can try to grab then with its Reach 2
&lt;strong&gt;pincers&lt;/strong&gt; a reaction. This does some initial damage on a hit, and from that
point on the demon can spend minor actions to sustain the grab and deal the same
amount of damage automatically. Only one victim can be grabbed at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the klurichir is first bloodied, it speaks a &lt;strong&gt;Blasphemous Utterance&lt;/strong&gt; that
deals necrotic damage and dazes (save ends) in a Close Blast 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huh, it turns out klurichirs are actually a bit weaker than Balors, who are
Level 27 Elite Brutes. So I have a bit of a hard time believing the text that
says they’re “on the cusp of becoming demon lords”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that also applies to balors, and you can reskin klurichirs into “baby
balors” wielding axes instead of the classic sword and whip combo. It’s also
relatively easy to make klurichirs into elites via the usual rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanically, I like the “no healz” aura and the pincers, which combine to put
grabbed PCs in a very unfortunate situation. Damaging a grabbed PC is a minor
action and the demon can still attack them with that high-damage axe.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Dark One</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark Ones appeared in the first 4e Monster Manual, and you can read my take on
that book’s entry &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2019/09/16/dark-one.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This entry adds a few more stat blocks and tries to
fill in the lore gaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-dark-one.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2010 Wizards of the Coast
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read the post linked above, you’ll see that the MM1 contained little in
the way of Dark One Lore. I speculated that most of them would be peaceful
civilians like halflings are, but it seems that the Monster Manual 3 is moving
in the opposite direction by saying they’re &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; thieving murderers. I guess
this is a prelude for some of the even more egregious stuff you could find on
the Monster Vault and on some early 5e supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book says Dark Ones are “incapable” of crafting beautiful or useful
objects. This is described more like a divine curse than some sort of
neurological limitation. Everything they make is destined to be ugly, fragile,
and useless. Their armor crumples, their weapons shatter. So instead of making
their own stuff, they steal other people’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the MM1 said, most Dark Ones live in the Shadowfell. This one says that they
tend to see the middle world as a, well, “loot pinãta”, full of stuff just
waiting to be taken. They tend to go for “loot caches” that are relatively
hidden from the larger societies of the middle world, and target groups that are
isolated from those same societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other worlds, your typical team of Dark One acquisition experts is in direct
competition with adventuring parties for the XP and treasure contained in
dungeons, bandit lairs, and cultist strongholds. The PCs could arrive at one of
these places only to discover a group of Dark Ones got there first and took all
the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of them prefer to work as mercenaries instead of thieves, and they’ll join
forces with anyone who pays them. Often their clients end up being cults of
Vecna and other appreciators of the sneaky-stabby arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, if you want to tone down the speciesism here, you can just remove
the divine curse bit. If you still want a Dark One community to be dependent on
goods from outside, you can say they rely on &lt;em&gt;trade&lt;/em&gt; more than on theft and
mercenary work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the basic Dark One information remains identical to what it was on the
MM1. They’re Small Shadow Humanoids with Darkvision, a Speed of 6, and two
signature abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is &lt;strong&gt;Dark Step&lt;/strong&gt;, an at-will move action that lets them move 4 squares
with a +4 AC bonus against opportunity attacks, and gain combat advantage
against any enemies it ends up adjacent to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is &lt;strong&gt;Killing Dark&lt;/strong&gt;, which causes them to explode in a cloud of inky
darkness when reduced to 0 HP, blinding any enemies adjacent to them for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hex-knight&quot;&gt;Hex Knight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hex Knights are the closest thing Dark Ones have to noble warriors, though their
codes of conduct apply only to members of their own society. Their gear is very
similar to that of a common sneaky-stabby Dark One: leather or hide armor, short
sword, hand crossbow. Their fighting style, however is much more direct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hex Knights are Level 4 Soldiers with 54 HP. They mark enemies using the
&lt;strong&gt;Shadow Hex&lt;/strong&gt; minor action, which lasts until the fight ends or the knight uses
it on someone else. Enemies who ignore the mark grant combat advantage to all
enemies for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;hand crossbow&lt;/strong&gt; is a basic ranged attack and it’s merely okay. Knights are
better in melee, where their basic &lt;strong&gt;short sword&lt;/strong&gt; can attack twice with one
action, and each hit slows the target. Knights can also use their swords in a
&lt;strong&gt;Vicious Flurry&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), which targets 1 or 2 enemies with a sword
attack that also does ongoing damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shadow-bolters&quot;&gt;Shadow Bolters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These spellcasters are usually on some secret mission to acquire a treasure or a
valuable bit of information, and will prioritize that mission over whatever else
might be going on. They might pose as mercenaries or allies to some other
faction as a cover. Once they have what they seek, they’ll abscond, leaving
enemies and allies alike behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bolters are Level 5 Artillery with 50 HP. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;daggers&lt;/strong&gt; in melee
and with &lt;strong&gt;black bolt&lt;/strong&gt; spells at range, and they’re all about gaining combat
advantage. The &lt;strong&gt;Deadly Precision&lt;/strong&gt; trait gives them combat advantage against
any enemy flanked by two allies, even if the bolter themselves are far
away. When they hit someone with combat advantage, they deal 5 extra necrotic
damage to the target and to any of the target’s allies adjacent to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The black bolts also make a hit target take 5 necrotic damage whenever they
provoke an opportunity attack (save ends), which is very situational but might
be useful to punish mobile PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shadow-speakers&quot;&gt;Shadow Speakers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow Speakers are the Dark Ones that know the necessary rituals for crossing
between the middle world and the Shadowfell. They lead “acquisition” expeditions
into the middle world, and are responsible for bringing them back home. They
carry little clay jugs filled with soil from the Shadowfell as a focus for their
powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shadow speakers are Level 6 Controllers with 70 HP. They fight with &lt;strong&gt;short
swords&lt;/strong&gt; and shadow magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic ranged attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Curse&lt;/strong&gt; that deals necrotic damage,
makes the target grant combat advantage, and inflicts 5 necrotic damage when the
target provokes an opportunity attack (save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Less often, they can cast a &lt;strong&gt;Choking Shadow&lt;/strong&gt; spell (recharge 5+), which deals
heavy necrotic damage and immobilizes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even one of these is an excellent force multiplier for a Dark One party, or
really for any encounter group whose members deal extra damage with combat
advantage. Just have then stay at the range limit for Shadow Curse and spam it
on the PCs to make them all grant combat advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Shadow Speakers tend to be “load-bearing monsters” for Dark
One encounter groups, since they’re the group’s only way home. If the Shadow
Speaker is in too much danger, the entire group might try to make a run for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the greater encounter variety, but I dislike the extra emphasis on a
species-wide negative stereotype (“they’re all thieves, every last one of
them”). I’ll stick to my initial assumptions that these stat blocks represent
the Dark One equivalent of adventurers and other combatants rather than typical
members of the culture.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Craud</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think crauds are a new monster. At the very least they’re one I haven’t met
before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crauds are giant crawdads! These crustaceans are about the same height as a
halfling, but bulkier. They tend to show up in large numbers in maritime and
coastal areas that have suffered extensive environmental damage such as from
pollution or overfishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these circumstances they’re very aggressive and voracious man-eaters, raiding
ships and villages with terrifying frequency. If a craud “army” shows up at your
village or town, they’ll keep showing up every few days until either all of them
or all of you are dead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This causes some scholars to speculate that crauds are the vengeance of Melora
made manifest and sent against those who despoil her coasts. Others defend the
more mundane explanation that crauds attack sapients because their usual food
sources have been driven to extiction by the environmental damage. In a world
where the goddess of nature is real, though, is there any difference?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess non-distressed crauds normally stay mostly underwater and feed on fish
and such. They’re non-sapient but have good teamwork instincts and a somewhat
“hive-like” social organization where certain individuals known as Kings can
direct other crauds via patterns of flashing colors and lights in their
carapaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes an unscrupulous sea-borne villain like a pirate captain will manage to
catch a craud king, torturing it in specific ways to direct its “subjects” to
attack interesting targets. Coastal druids and clerics of Melora know gentler
ways to secure the cooperation of these crustaceans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-monsters&quot;&gt;The Monsters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crauds are Medium Natural Beasts with the Aquatic keyword. They have darkvision,
and move at speed 6 on land or in water. The effects of the Aquatic keyword
haven’t changed, but in this book they’re written down on all the stat blocks as
a trait: aquatic creatures can breathe underwater, and when fighting underwater
gain a +2 attack bonus against non-aquatic opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;craud-impaler&quot;&gt;Craud Impaler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impalers are lithe and quick on their feet, usually arriving at the head of a
craud “army”. Their job is to tie up the opposition until their stronger cousins
can arrive. They’re cautious, and become more so after being bloodied,
preferring to focus on already weakened opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impalers are Level 3 Skirmishers with 51 HP. They fight using &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; and some
sort of pointy appendage that allows them to make an &lt;strong&gt;Impale&lt;/strong&gt; attack. It has
Reach 2, deals light physical damage, and inflicts ongoing 5 damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impale is an encounter power, and the claws are a bit underpowered too. But the
&lt;strong&gt;Scissor Claws&lt;/strong&gt; at-will ability allows the impaler to make two claw attacks,
and if both hit the creature immediately recharges Impale and uses it as a free
action. That’s a lot of damage if everything hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when the impaler misses with an attack, &lt;strong&gt;Scuttle&lt;/strong&gt; allows it to shift 2
squares as a free action. So if that any component of that claw/claw/impale
combo fails to hit, the beast can try to get away safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;craud-crusher&quot;&gt;Craud Crusher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the “stronger cousins” the impalers are waiting for. Their claws are
so huge they can crush a human torso, or bludgeon that human with enough force
to send them flying. When they arrive, they engage the impalers’ opponents and
free the impalers up to scuttle around and be skirmishers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crushers are Level 4 Brutes with 70 HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; do surprisingly little
basic damage, but a hit with them also grabs the target. Crushers can grab one
victim at a time, and can inflict automatic damage to them with a minor
action. Once per encounter they can also use &lt;strong&gt;Hammerclaw&lt;/strong&gt; to backhand a fool,
dealing heavy damage, pushing 1 square, and knocking them prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the crusher reduces anyone to 0 HP by any means, &lt;strong&gt;Red Tide&lt;/strong&gt; gives them a +5
bonus to their next damage roll. This is an incentive for them to target enemies
previously softened by impalers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;craud-king&quot;&gt;Craud King&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craud Kings are imposing specimens whose shells are covered in bio-luminescent
organs. Signals from these organs direct other crauds and boost their morale in
a fight. There might be some magic involved here, as some of their light
patterns have an effect on humanoids too. The creature is also a pretty good
fighter itself, so its ideal location is at the forefront of the melee
surrounded by loyal subjects. The best way to influence a craud force is to
influence its king, as discussed in the Lore section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kings are Level 5 Soldiers with the Leader tag and 67 HP. Their lights project
an aura (3) named &lt;strong&gt;Blood in the Water&lt;/strong&gt;, giving allies a +2 bonus to attack
bloodied targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; do good damage and slide the target 1 square. &lt;strong&gt;Claw Flurry&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 5+) allows them to attack twice, and if a slid enemy ends up adjacent
to one of the king’s allies, the ally gets to make a free attack too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By changing the pattern of its lights, the King can use the &lt;strong&gt;Angler’s Lure&lt;/strong&gt;
ability as a minor action. This is a charm attack that does no damage, pulls
the victim 3 squares, and marks it for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, when the king is bloodied it prompts all of its allies to act &lt;strong&gt;For The
King&lt;/strong&gt;. All allies within 5 squares of the wounded sovereign immediately shifts
4 squares closer to the king and make free attacks against any enemy they end up
next to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this had been a 3e-style entry, I’d probably have glossed over it
entirely. Giant crawdads, yawn. The varied stat blocks to make them more
interesting, as does the “nature’s vengeance” aspect of their lore. That’s a
handy adventure hook built right into the monster entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you could complete the lineup seen here with custom-made artillery
crauds that fire high-pressure water jets. Or maybe you could use the
“controlled by pirates” angle to pair them up with pirate musketeers.&lt;/p&gt;
