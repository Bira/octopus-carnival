&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another setting-specific group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dythan’s Legion is a large all-dragonborn military organization. As the name
implies, their leader is Legatus Dythan, an ambitious and charismatic leader who
dreams of seeing Arkhosia restored to its ancient glory, presumably with him at
the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Legion uses the same ranks and organization as the ancient armies of
Arkhosia, and numbers about 500 members in total, usually operating in platoons
of 20 to 24 people. These are supported by war-trained drakes and behemoths, and
sometimes even by salvaged Arkhosian battle constructs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon admission into the Legion, every member is branded with a symbol that used
to be a Turathi slave marking. Dythan’s ancestors in the Drakerider clan used to
live in the border between Arkhosia and Bael Turath, and were taken captive in a
Turathi raid. After they were freed or escaped their enslavement, they took the
mark for their own as a reminder of what Arkhosia was fighting against, and
passed it onto their descendants. Dythan himself bears such a mark, and makes
sure his soldiers remember as he does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the Legion usually operates far south of the Vale, a contingent of them
arrived here recently looking for ruins of Arkhosian outposts that are said to
have been here back in the old days. One of them, Rolaz-Gaar, is somewhere along
the shores of Lake Nen (in the NE corner of the Vale). Another might be
somewhere beneath the Ogrefist Hills near the Vale’s western border. The Legion
detachments concentrate in these two locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite being fairly small when compared to those ancient imperial armies, the
Legion is still a large force by the standards of our narrative present, and its
members are well-trained and well-equipped professionals. They’re not interested
in conquering the Vale, but they’re unlikely to be very nice to anyone who
stands in the way of their search. It’s unclear from the text whether Dythan
himself is in the Vale at the moment. If the GM judges the ruins contain
something really important, then he’s likely to be here overseeing the searches
personally. If he’s not, a sufficient challenge to the Legion’s operations in
the area might result in him appearing with reinforcements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual people who make up the legion are all dragonborn, and their elite
training places them as early Paragon threats. We also get stats for their
salvaged Arkhosian siege towers, and for the Liondrakes they use as mounts. They
use other drakes and behemoths in various roles, but those use the base
stats for these creatures, perhaps leveled-up to match their handlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As dragonborn, all members of Dythan’s Legion can use &lt;strong&gt;Dragon Breath&lt;/strong&gt;, which
like the PC version is an encounter power that lets them breathe energy in a
Close Burst 3 vs. Reflex. The damage type varies per stat block, and can be
changed to match specific individuals. They also have Speed 6, and the
non-minions have the PC trait that gives them +1 to hit while bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alignment-wise, every dragonborn here including Dythan has the Evil alignment,
which paints us an interesting picture combined with the slave marking story in
the Lore section. You could perhaps see them as greedy and ruthless imperialists
who are nevertheless vehemently against slavery in all its forms. It would also
be relatively easy to say they focus on the less-bad parts of Arkhosia’s past
and make them Unaligned. Making them actively heroic is more of a stretch, I
feel, and would require bigger changes to their background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like we did with the Daggerburg goblins, we’ll look at them in order of
increasing level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dythans-legion-warrior&quot;&gt;Dythan’s Legion Warrior&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rank and file of the Legion is made up of these veteran soldiers. They’re
Level 10 Minion Skirmishers wearing leather armor and carrying heavy
shields. They fight with spears in melee, and can throw javelins at range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Phalanx Formation&lt;/strong&gt; trait gives them an extra +1 AC per adjacent ally,
up to a maximum of +4. This would be a big no-no on a regular monster (remember
MM1 hobgoblins?) but it’s OK to have on a minion since you only need to hit them
once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Spear&lt;/strong&gt; Attack deals a bit of extra damage when they have combat
advantage, and allows the warrior to shift 1 square before or after the
attack. The &lt;strong&gt;Javelin&lt;/strong&gt; is a standard ranged attack. Their breath is lightning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs are unlikely to meet legionnaires in numbers smaller than a platoon, and
this stat block helps fill out those numbers without making the encounter
impossible. They can be easily made into regulars if you need more powerful
infantry for an encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dythans-legion-archer&quot;&gt;Dythan’s Legion Archer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are battlefield archers, so they’re trained to put a lot of arrows into a
group of clustered targets. They’re Level 10 Artillery with 84 HP. The &lt;strong&gt;short
sword&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Longbow&lt;/strong&gt; basic attacks are solid, with the latter being the
better option. They can also fire an &lt;strong&gt;Arrow Volley&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 4+) that targets
enemies in an Area Burst 1 within 20 squares and does light physical damage to
each one it hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;dragon breath&lt;/strong&gt; deals cold damage and also pushes 1 square on a hit,
making it a good “keep-away” emergency power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dythans-legion-vanguard&quot;&gt;Dythan’s Legion Vanguard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vanguards march into battle at the front of the Legion’s infantry formations,
engaging the enemy directly to give space for the mobile Warriors to flank
them. They’re Level 11 Soldiers with 111 HP, wear plate, and carry swords and
heavy shields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have the same &lt;strong&gt;Phalanx Formation&lt;/strong&gt; trait as the Warriors, which means they
punch above far above their weight as far as AC is concerned. If you can’t
isolate them from their allies, hit them in the non-armor defenses!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic &lt;strong&gt;Longsword&lt;/strong&gt; attack marks for a turn on a hit, and they can use
minor actions to &lt;strong&gt;shield bash&lt;/strong&gt; marked targets. This does no damage, but dazes
for a turn. &lt;strong&gt;Vanguard’s Mark&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge when first bloodied) allows them to
mark a target that’s up to 5 squares away with a minor action. If the marked
target doesn’t end their next turn adjacent to the vanguard, the vanguard can
charge it as a free action that doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. This makes
the power an excellent way to hit the PC’s squishies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Dragon Breath&lt;/strong&gt; does poison damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dythans-legion-dragoon&quot;&gt;Dythan’s Legion Dragoon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real-world dragoons were so named because they were cavalry that carried
firearms (so their weapons “spat fire”). The dragoons of Dythan’s Legion got
this name from the fact that they ride the next best thing to an actual dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragoons are Level 12 Controllers with the Leader keyword and 119 HP. They wear
leather like the infantry, and carry &lt;strong&gt;lances&lt;/strong&gt; into combat. Most of their
abilities are related to mounted combat. The &lt;strong&gt;Masterful Rider&lt;/strong&gt; trait negates 1
square of all forced movement imposed upon them if they’re mounted; the
&lt;strong&gt;Incensed Mount&lt;/strong&gt; reaction allows their mount to make a free basic attack
against an enemy who damages the rider; and even their basic lance attack knocks
prone on a hit if the dragoon is mounted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Battlefield Mastery&lt;/strong&gt; power (recharge 4+) is a minor action that allows
every ally in a Close Burst 2 to shift 1 square. And yeah, the mount is an
ally. Their &lt;strong&gt;Dragon Breath&lt;/strong&gt; does acid damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragoons are quite dangerous when mounted! Canny PCs will seek to knock them
down and prevent them from remounting again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;liondrake&quot;&gt;Liondrake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Captured young in the distant deserts of the south, these Large Natural Beasts
are the mount of choice for Dythan’s Dragoons. They look a lot like dragons, and
have many of the same attacks, but are not sapient and lack breath weapons. The
specimen statted up here has been trained as a war mount and is a Level 12
Skirmisher with 122 HP. It has a ground speed of 7, a fly speed of 10, and
Darkvision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drake’s &lt;strong&gt;Fierce Mount&lt;/strong&gt; trait gives both it and its rider a +4 bonus to
defenses against opportunity attacks. It has both a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; as
basic attacks, and can perform &lt;strong&gt;Battle Leaps&lt;/strong&gt; that allow it to shift up to 4
squares and then either bite once or claw twice. It has a &lt;strong&gt;Terrifying Roar&lt;/strong&gt;
encounter power that is kinda like dragon breath, targeting a Close Blast 5,
doing thunder damage, and dazing (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liondrakes are dangerous even on their own, but they synergize very well with
Dragoons. They also make great mounts for other kinds of paragon-tier “rider”
opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;arkhosian-siege-tower&quot;&gt;Arkhosian Siege Tower&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-dythans-legion-tower.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are ancient constructs built by Arkhosia and salvaged by the Legion. They
were either brought to the vale from the South, or salvaged from local Arkhosian
ruins depending on how you want to play it in your campaign. They are 30-foot
tall and 15-foot wide stone towers that move on 10-foot tall granite rollers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tower can transport troops in its two internal floors, allowing them to
disembark on enemy battlements. On top of it is a sculpted dragon head that can
swivel in a 360-degree arc and shoot fireballs at enemies. Being a construct,
the tower is capable of driving and shooting by itself, though if it gets too
damaged its occupants will dearly feel the lack of internal safety equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arkosian Siege Towers are Huge Natural Animates with the Construct keyword and
336 HP. They’re immune to charm, disease, and poison, and have Resist 15 to all
damage originating from outside themselves. The rest of their stat block really
stretches the format in an attempt to model all they can do, starting with a
trio of very interesting traits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All-Around Vision&lt;/strong&gt; means they don’t grant combat advantage when flanked;
&lt;strong&gt;Juggernaut&lt;/strong&gt; means it ignores difficult terrain and doesn’t provoke
opportunity attacks, but it also can’t squeeze, make OAs, or grab
creatures. &lt;strong&gt;Living Building&lt;/strong&gt; has a list of effects as long as my arm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tower can occupy other creature’s spaces, and other creatures can end
their movement in its spaces. That’s rules-talk for “it can fit people inside
itself”. When it moves, creatures inside move along with it as if it was a
vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tower is 30 feet tall and has two internal 15-foot tall levels. The
Athletics DC for climbing it from the outside is 20.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The lower level has two iron double doors (break DC 25) that it can open and
close as a free action. When the doors are closed, there is no line of sight
or effect between the inside and outside.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The upper level has arrow slits that allow occupants to shoot outside. It’s
linked to the lower level by 2 ladders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &lt;strong&gt;Rough Ride&lt;/strong&gt; trait models how damage impacts the tower. While
bloodied, the tower is slowed and inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks on all its
occupants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a construct, the tower has two attacks. The &lt;strong&gt;Dragon’s Head&lt;/strong&gt; shoots
fireballs (Area 1 within 20) that deal immediate and ongoing fire damage, half
on a miss. And it can &lt;strong&gt;Crush&lt;/strong&gt; with its move action, which allows it to make
attacks against any creatures whose spaces it enters during the move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the tower drops to 0 HP, it &lt;strong&gt;Collapses&lt;/strong&gt;, making an attack vs. the Reflex
of every occupant that deals heavy damage and knocks them prone on a hit. The
tower’s space becomes difficult terrain (a giant pile of rubble!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stats make no mention of a disembarking ramp on the second level, but it’s
easy to say there is one there. It’d be as sturdy as the ground floor doors, and
controlled in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to fight a siege tower is from inside, where you can bypass its DR
and “only” have to contend with its occupants. These are likely to be a
combination of vanguards and archers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legatus-dythan&quot;&gt;Legatus Dythan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dythan is big and imposing even for a Dragonborn. He wears an ornate suit of
plate adorned with Arkhosian heraldic devices done in gold inlay. He’s not just
a competent general, but an extremely skilled combatant as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dythan is a Level 15 Elite Soldier with 290 HP and the Leader keyword. He wears
his nifty armor suit and carries a shield, a sword and a brace of javelins into
battle. He has the same &lt;strong&gt;Phalanx Formation&lt;/strong&gt; trait as his vanguards, and
projects a &lt;strong&gt;Last Stand&lt;/strong&gt; aura (5) that gives allies inside a +2 bonus to damage
while they’re bloodied. He also gains at +2 to hit while bloodied himself,
instead of the usual +1 for dragonborn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dythan might be a Soldier but he doesn’t mark anyone. Instead he wants the PCs
to mark him! His &lt;strong&gt;longsword&lt;/strong&gt; deals bonus damage if the target is marking
Dythan or has an active defender aura. If an enemy marks an ally within 5
squares of Dythan, he can use &lt;strong&gt;Dythan’s Challenge&lt;/strong&gt; to transfer the mark to
himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action he can perform a &lt;strong&gt;Shield Bash&lt;/strong&gt;, which damages, pushes 1
square, and allows the legate to shift 1 square to follow. This is a full attack
with standard damage because he’s an elite. Those javelins are &lt;strong&gt;Shock
Javelins&lt;/strong&gt; that deal lightning damage. And finally, his &lt;strong&gt;Dragon Breath&lt;/strong&gt; is the
traditional fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like Dythan’s Legion. They’re a major threat compared to almost
everything else in the Vale, but they’re focused on doing their own thing and
have no reason to be immediately hostile to the PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how villainous you want to make them, they might make a good
late-game antagonist faction when they find those ancient ruins and start
bringing in their full numbers to the Vale looking to conquer it and make it
their new base of operations. They might also work as uneasy allies against
other Vale-wide threats, like a full-scale Bloodspear invasion or one of the big
dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Threats to the Nentir Vale: Dark Drake of the Moon Hills</title>

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another original monster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest human settlement in the Vale in our narrative present is the city of
Fallcrest, which is more or less exactly in its center and connected by roads to
the other major towns. It’s a big point of light, but the darkness starts just
beyond it. Those roads are dangerous, and even the areas just outside the city’s
walls contain their own threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the Moon Hills, for example, which are just to the south of the city. On
the blackest of nights, a fearsome beast is said to roam the hills and moors of
that region, hunting the unwary. No one has ever seen the Dark Drake and lived
to tell the tale - its existence is only known by the gruesome remains it leaves
behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dark Drake is in some ways Fallcrest’s pet monster, as it features in many
stories told in taverns or to children. These tales attribute all sorts of weird
abilities to it, and also talk about its extensive brood. These “lesser” drakes
&lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been frequently spotted in the area, and they’re also clearly more
dangerous and malignant than simple natural animals, but the Dark Drake itself
has remained elusive for decades, evading even experienced monster
hunters. Serious scholars dismiss it as just a myth. It doesn’t help that
opportunists from Fallcrest sometimes stage hoaxes to make a buck or cover up a
more mundane murder. Nevertheless, these smaller drakes and hoaxes can’t explain
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the bodies found on the Moon Hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entries below assume that the Drake does indeed exist, and that it has some
connection to its “brood”. You are likely to find them together. They’re all
Natural Beasts with the Reptile keyword. As a reminder, “Natural” only means
it’s native to the middle world, and “Beast” means it looks and behaves like an
animal. We’re still dealing with a weird mystical creature here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dark-drake-of-the-moon-hills&quot;&gt;Dark Drake of the Moon Hills&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drake itself is Large, and a Level 8 Elite Lurker with 148 HP. That’s a hell
of a thing to meet just outside the Vale’s premier “starting town”. It has
Darkvision and a speed of 6. Its basic &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; is quite strong for a lurker,
and it can use &lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt; to bite twice in an action. Instead of biting,
it can use the &lt;strong&gt;Ghost Drake&lt;/strong&gt; ability to gain insubstantial and phasing for a
turn, move its speed, and then become invisible until the end of the encounter
or until after it makes an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being invisible allows the Dark Drake to use its &lt;strong&gt;Unseen Killer&lt;/strong&gt; power, a
melee attack that targets Will and does heavy psychic damage - about double that
of a bite. It can also use its &lt;strong&gt;Terrible Aspect&lt;/strong&gt; as a weapon, a minor-action
melee attack against Will that pushes the target 1 square and immobilizes them
for a turn. This recharges whenever the drake hits with any of its other
attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dark Drake can sustain the same damage output whether it decides to stand
and fight or to employ the more lurkerish tactic of alternating Ghost Drake and
Unseen Killer. The latter is still a bit better since as a lurker its defenses
and HP are a bit low for its level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hellghost-dark-drake&quot;&gt;Hellghost Dark Drake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the two “dark brood” stat blocks we get in this entry. Hellghosts are
Large Natural Beasts and Level 6 Brutes with 85 HP. It has Darkvision, a Speed
of 8, and Fire Resistance 5. It projects an aura of &lt;strong&gt;Ghostfire Radiance&lt;/strong&gt; (1)
that makes creatures inside Vulnerable 5 to fire. I wonder how that interacts
with a tiefling’s natural resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creature uses a &lt;strong&gt;Fiery Bite&lt;/strong&gt; as its basic attack, which deals heavy fire
damage even before you account for the aura. Once per encounter it can use
&lt;strong&gt;Ghostfire Rampage&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a standard “trample” ability: the drake moves
its speed and can cross enemy spaces. Every time it does so, it makes an attack
against that enemy. On a hit, it deals fire damage, knocks prone, and inflicts
ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also once per encounter, when the drake is immobilized, restrained, or stunned,
it can use &lt;strong&gt;Pulsing Ghostfire&lt;/strong&gt; to attack a Close Burst 2. On a hit it deals
fire damage and knocks the target prone, on a miss it still deals half damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adderbrood-dark-drake&quot;&gt;Adderbrood Dark Drake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is highly venomous. It’s a Medium Natural Beast, and a Level 7
Skirmisher with 79 HP. Its &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; deals poison damage and slows for a turn.
It can attack these slowed targets with a &lt;strong&gt;Venomous Strike&lt;/strong&gt; that deals the
same amount of poison damage and inflicts ongoing poison damage (save
ends). After the first failed save, the victim also becomes immobilized. A
successful save clears both this and the ongoing damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adder’s Mobility&lt;/strong&gt; ensures that enemies slowed or immobilized by the drake
cannot make opportunity attacks against it, and that the drake can enter their
spaces. So it can, say, bite a defender and move through them to reach the
squishies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impression&quot;&gt;Final Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Drake’s lore sounds a bit commonplace at first, and its stats while
mechanically interesting are far from the most powerful thing we’ll see even in
this book… but the full impact of it all hits when you look at a map of the
Nentir Vale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re starting a campaign in the Nentir Vale, there’s a very high chance
that Fallcrest will be your PC’s starting home base. It’s big enough to offer
all the standard services, and it’s centrally located so they have plenty of
choice of where to adventure. The only reason not to start here is if the GM has
a more specific campaign or module in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Moon Hills are right beside it, to the south. The road connecting
Fallcrest and the Harkenwold goes through them! If you still hold any notion of
D&amp;amp;D being “like a MMO” that demands every fight be “fair” after reading this
far, this is where you drop them. A MMO would surround the starting town with
low-level trash enemies you can grind for levels. This book puts a level 8 elite
newbie-killer where those would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If deployed by a cruel GM against Level 1-2 players, the Drake is a terrifying
threat they must escape from. It can kill a PC in one round of attacks no matter
which approach it chooses. Against a party of experienced monster hunters who
are closer to it in level, you’ll want to deploy the Drake alongside some of its
brood to make a proper boss fight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goblins have always been in the game, as we already know. This is a specific
group of them operating in the southern regions of the Vale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the Witchlight Fens and the Harken Forest, roughly on the south-central
region of the Vale, there is a hidden fort named Daggerburg. It belongs to a
large band of goblin brigands, who ride out of it to raid and pillage the
surrounding area. Their operation is quite successful because they’re far away
from the territories of more powerful monsters, and because their very diverse
membership has been extensively trained in guerrilla tactics by their leader
Delderosh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band also includes a number of remarkable individuals beyond Delderosh
himself. There’s Kabo Bomble, a massive bruiser nearly twice the size of a
typical goblin; and there are the Mistmane Bugbears, a cult who trains in a
fighting style that combines unarmed combat and necromantic magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delderosh really hates enemy spellcasters and likes collecting their eyeballs as
trophies. He likes spellcasters just fine when they’re working for him, though,
which is why he’s allied to the necromancer Gokof (from the Cadaver Collector
entry) and has several war mages on his payroll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Daggerburg goblins have become more daring of late, and have been pushing
deeper into the Harkenwold region north of the Harken forest, even going so far
as to raid settlements. However they haven’t yet worked up the courage to strike
at the Woodsinger elves who also live in the same region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Daggerburg gang tends to be a cut above your standard MM/MV goblins, their
levels covering the latter half of the Heroic Tier instead of the earlier
one. Most of them also have at least one of the following signature abilities
representing their training:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combat Adept&lt;/strong&gt; gives them a +1d10 damage bonus against enemies who haven’t yet
acted this combat. Anyone with this trait really likes rolling high for
initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daggerburg Tactics&lt;/strong&gt; replaces the generic Goblin Tactics trait. When a
creature with this is missed by a melee attack, the attacker grants combat
advantage to them in this next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;battle-worg&quot;&gt;Battle Worg&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Daggerburg goblins raise a distinctive breed of giant wolf for use as mounts
in battle. Despite being called “battle worgs”, they’re not sapient like
standard worgs, and are a little weaker. Their mechanics are still similar,
though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battle Worgs are Large Natural Magical Beasts and Level 5 Brutes with 78 HP and
a speed of 8. Their &lt;strong&gt;Frigthful Growls&lt;/strong&gt; acts as an aura (1) that inflicts a -1
to-hit penalty on enemies caught inside. Their mount trait is &lt;strong&gt;Slavering
Lunge&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets the worg move half its speed as a free action when their
rider rolls initiative. Their reach 1 &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; damages and inflicts ongoing 5
damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the people who could use battle worgs as mounts in this entry are
higher level than them, but it’s a simple enough task to level up the worgs to
match their riders if you want them to last longer in the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;daggerburg-ruffian&quot;&gt;Daggerburg Ruffian&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An experienced raider, this goblin is a Level 4 Soldier with 58 HP and a speed
of 5. It’s armored in mail, wields a light shield and spear combo in melee, and
a light crossbow for ranged combat. It has both Combat Adept and Daggerburg
Tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;spear&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;crossbow&lt;/strong&gt; are used in basic attacks, and the spear can also
&lt;strong&gt;trip up&lt;/strong&gt; an enemy, doing the same damage as a basic attack and knocking the
target prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruffians are perfect riders for the battle worgs we just saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;daggerburg-theurge&quot;&gt;Daggerburg Theurge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theurges seem to be goblin spellcasters with a witchy theme. They’re Level 5
Controllers with 64 HP and both signature traits. They’re listed as Medium, but
should be Small instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They fight in melee with &lt;strong&gt;spiked clubs&lt;/strong&gt;, and once per encounter they can call
down a &lt;strong&gt;Brimstone Rain&lt;/strong&gt; that works as an area burst 2 attack. It deals
immediate and ongoing fire damage (save ends), half on a miss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their most fun power, however, is the at-will &lt;strong&gt;Slimy Transformation&lt;/strong&gt;. Ranged 5
vs. Fortitude, does no damage, but &lt;em&gt;turns the target into a frog&lt;/em&gt; (save ends)!
This is a mundane Tiny frog, not a giant variety. Frogged targets are considered
slowed, and can’t use powers - not even basic attacks. The only limitation here
is that the theurge can’t cast this on someone who’s already transformed by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, they are sure to open up with Brimstone Rain and then stay away
applying the Transformation to as many PCs as possible while their buddies do
the actual damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;daggerburg-war-mage&quot;&gt;Daggerburg War Mage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mage, this one a more straighforward hobgoblin elemental adept. It’s
Level 6 Artillery with 58 HP. They have Combat Adept but not Daggerburg Tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;War mages fight with their &lt;strong&gt;staffs&lt;/strong&gt;, which also work as implements. At range
they can hit you with an at-will &lt;strong&gt;Stabbing Flame&lt;/strong&gt; that does immediate and
ongoing fire damage, or with a recharge 5+ &lt;strong&gt;Icy Stream&lt;/strong&gt; that does cold damage
and slides the target 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;daggerburg-slayer&quot;&gt;Daggerburg Slayer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beefy hobgoblin with a big axe. It’s a Level 6 Brute with 85 HP. It has Combat
Adept but not Daggerburg Tactics. Their &lt;strong&gt;greataxe&lt;/strong&gt; is their sole attack, but
it has some riders: it deals +5 damage while the slayer is bloodied, and it
deals another +5 damage if the strike bloodies the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter the slayer can use its &lt;strong&gt;Hobgoblin Resilience&lt;/strong&gt; to
immediately roll a save against an (save ends) effect as a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;daggerburg-zealot&quot;&gt;Daggerburg Zealot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bugbear trained with the glaive. Not one of the Mistmanes, those are
below. Zealots are Level 7 Skirmishers with 78 HP. They have Combat Adept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;glaive&lt;/strong&gt; is a solid Reach 2 basic attack and their &lt;strong&gt;Mobile Attack&lt;/strong&gt;
ability allows them to shift half their speed and make a glaive attack at any
point during the movement. Once per encounter, when an enemy within 5 squares of
the zealot attacks one of its allies, the zealot can use &lt;strong&gt;Dagerburg Zealotry&lt;/strong&gt;
shift up to 5 squares and hit the attacker with its glaive as a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very mobile combatant with a reach weapon, who will use both of these things
to get at the party’s back lines and mess up their squishies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;daggerburg-captain&quot;&gt;Daggerburg Captain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hobgoblin officer probably serves directly under Delderosh. It’s a Level 7
Soldier (Leader) with 78 HP. The captain is clad in mail and wields a bastard
sword and a shield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;bastard sword&lt;/strong&gt; makes attacks that damage and mark for a turn. While the
mark persists, the target also grants combat advantage. Once per encounter, and
once again after it’s first bloodied, the captain can yell &lt;strong&gt;Follow Me!&lt;/strong&gt; and
charge an enemy. Two allies within 5 squares of its starting position can then
make a free charge against different enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The captain has none of the signature traits from the start of this
section. Instead, it has an improved version of Hobgoblin Resilience named
&lt;strong&gt;Daggerburg Resilience&lt;/strong&gt;, which works the same but can be applied either to the
captain or to an ally within 5 squares of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;daggerburg-reaper&quot;&gt;Daggerburg Reaper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hobgoblin who specializes in the use of the scythe. It’s a Level 7 Lurker with
64 HP. The &lt;strong&gt;scythe&lt;/strong&gt; can make decent basic attacks, and once per encounter the
reaper can use a &lt;strong&gt;Blinding Sweep&lt;/strong&gt; that targets a Close Burst 1, deals heavy
damage, and blinds for a turn on a hit. A miss does half damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a move action, the reaper can &lt;strong&gt;Stalk&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows it to shift 1 square
and then move its speed. If it ends in a space at least three squares from any
other creatures, it becomes invisible until the start of its next turn or until
it makes an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These abilities are interesting but the reaper has no powers that specifically
exploit them. It’s a very skirmishery lurker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mistmane-bugbear&quot;&gt;Mistmane Bugbear&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These bugbear adepts received their name from the constant misty aura they
project, which disrupts teleportation and can confuse enemies’ minds. Their
claws are laced with necromantic energy. They’re Large Natural Humanoids and
Level 8 Elite Soldiers with 172 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have Combat Adept, and their &lt;strong&gt;Arcane Mist&lt;/strong&gt; aura (2) prevents creatures
from teleporting as mentioned above. Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Rake&lt;/strong&gt; with their
claws, which damages and marks for a turn. If a marked enemy makes an attack
that doesn’t target the bugbear, they take 5 necrotic damage. As elites, they
can use this for &lt;strong&gt;Double Attacks&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter as a minor action they can use the &lt;strong&gt;Bewildering Mist&lt;/strong&gt;
ability, attacking the Will of every enemy in a Close Burst 1. A hit dazes the
target for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mistmanes are excellent front-line fighters, able to keep two PCs marked at
once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kabo-bomble&quot;&gt;Kabo Bomble&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the Daggerburg gang’s champions, Kabo Bomble is a giant of a goblin,
twice as tall as the typical member of the species. This puts him well into
Medium size. He fights with a morningstar in one hand and a spiked gauntlet in
the other. Kabo is a Level 9 Brute with 116 HP. He has both Combat Adept and
Daggerburg Tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kabo’s &lt;strong&gt;morningstar&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;gauntlet&lt;/strong&gt; do about the same damage, with the first
being a basic attack and the second targetting Reflex and dazing for a turn on a
critical hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twice per encounter, Kabo can use a &lt;strong&gt;Furious Attack&lt;/strong&gt; ability to attack with
both weapons in a single action. If both hit the same target, it is dazed for a
turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter, Kabo Bomble can &lt;strong&gt;Roar&lt;/strong&gt; as a minor action, attacking the
Will of all enemies in a Close Burst 2 and inflicting a -2 defense penalty on a
hit (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;warlord-delderosh&quot;&gt;Warlord Delderosh&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-daggerburg-delderosh.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delderosh is the leader of the Daggerburg Goblins, and is likely to be found
leading their biggest raids or at the center of Daggerburg itself surrounded by
his personal guard. This hobgoblin is a Level 10 Skirmisher (Leader) with 200
HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delderosh’s custom traits are &lt;strong&gt;Ambush Leader&lt;/strong&gt;, which gives a +5 to the
Initiative rolls of every ally within 5 squares of him at the start of the
fight; and &lt;strong&gt;Combat Advantage&lt;/strong&gt;, which gives him some bonus damage when he has
that against a target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delderosh carries a &lt;strong&gt;spear&lt;/strong&gt; for fighting in melee and a &lt;strong&gt;shortbow&lt;/strong&gt; for
ranged attacks. The spear attack allows him to shift 1 square as an effect and
it can be used to &lt;strong&gt;Skewer&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), which deals the same damage as a
basic attack and inflicts ongoing 10 damage (save ends). As an effect, it also
makes the target grant combat advantage for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, he has the same &lt;strong&gt;Daggerburg Resilience&lt;/strong&gt; reaction power as the
Captains working under him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warlord is depicted riding a battle worg here and he would certainly benefit
from the thing’s traits, but you’ll likely need to increase the level of his
personal mount from the base 5. Everyone else in the encounter where he appears
should have Combat Adept to maximize the benefit they get from his initiative
bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Daggerburg goblins don’t differ much in concept from the “generic” band of
goblin brigands, but they’re a very nice worked example of the trope, with
several memorable named NPCs. They also show us how to stretch classic
goblinoids into a threat that can keep PCs occupied for the whole of the heroic
tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The band might get involved in factional conflicts with the Iron Circle, a
foreign mercenary army that has been moving into Harkenwold. And the druids of
Harken’s Heart would be among the groups they avoid. Both of these get their own
entries later on.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Threats to the Nentir Vale: Clan Bloodspear</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an original entry about a specific group of antagonists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clan Bloodspear is a large clan of orcs who make their home in the Stonemarch, a
desolate region to the northwest of the Nentir Vale, separated from it by the
Cairngorm Peaks. From what I understand, they’re pretty well adapted to it and
don’t really need to raid their neighbors for resources. However, Gruumsh still
exerts his divine influence to make sure they form a huge horde and ravage the
surrounding lands about once every century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clan was founded by the eponymous King Bloodspear, who in the distant past
slew the elder dragon Kulkozsar in single combat and made a throne of his
skull. The glory from his deed attracted many followers, and they made the
dragon’s former lair into an entire underground city that kept being expanded
and improved over time. In our narrative present it includes multiple forges,
arenas, and slave pens. Their technology and production base is significantly
higher than that of other orc clans, though they still rely on slave labor to
power a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time the Bloodspear marched forth was ninety years ago, when they
attacked Nentir Vale and practically erased the civilizations within it. The
land and its inhabitants have yet to fully recover from that attack, and yet it
seems they’re getting ready to do it again. Gruumsh has selected a new champion
among the Bloodspear, and that champion is hard at work in forging them into an
invading army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an uncharacteristic move for the patriarchal Bloodspear, this new champion is
a woman: Queen Msuga. She’s an extremely formidable warrior and general, and has
defeated enough challengers to her legitimacy that all of them now accept her
rule. Msuga is always accompanied by her sister Rohka, who is also known as the
Blood Witch. As a high priest of Gruumsh, she commands vast mystical powers
despite her withered body. Some rumors say Rohka is the true power behind the
throne and Msuga is just a puppet. Whatever the truth is, it’s clear the two
sisters are united in purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this purpose is an ambitious one: the sisters are preparing not to simply
raid the Nentir Vale, but to conquer and annex it as part of their nascent
Bloodspear Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to their powerful leaders and their large numbers of combat-ready
orcs, Clan Bloodspear also contains a small but significant percentage of
individuals of mixed orc and troll or ogre descent. The book described this as a
“breeding program” overseen by Rohka and calls the results “vile half-breeds”,
but I don’t like this language at all and would probably explain it as a natural
consequence of them sharing space with ogres and trolls over on the Stonemarch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clan Bloodspear would mostly be made up of orcs fitting the standard profiles
listed on the Monster Vault, but they also have some combat traditions that are
unique to them. We also get stat blocks for the half-troll and half-ogre
(ogrillon) members of the clan. You could conceivably add full-blooded ogres and
trolls to their numbers as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, orcs are Medium Natural Humanoids with a speed of 6 and Low-light
vision. Their signature trait is &lt;strong&gt;Savage Demise&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets them take a
standard action for free when they hit 0 HP. Some of the stat blocks here play
with that standard template a bit, and I’ll point out when they do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bloodspear-grenadier&quot;&gt;Bloodspear Grenadier&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-clan-bloodspear-grenadier.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bloodspear like their explosives! Grenadiers are Level 4 Artillery with 44
HP. They carry 2 &lt;strong&gt;handaxes&lt;/strong&gt; to fight in melee or to throw, and 4 &lt;strong&gt;fire
bombs&lt;/strong&gt; that act as area burst 1 attacks and deal fire damage. Once per
encounter when an enemy ends their movement adjacent to the grenadier, they can
shift 2 squares and drop a load of &lt;strong&gt;caltrops&lt;/strong&gt; in a close blast 3 pattern. This
creates a zone that damages anyone who enters it or ends its turn inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grenadiers replace Savage Demise with &lt;strong&gt;Blazing Fury&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals 5 fire
damage to all adjacent creatures and lets them throw a fire bomb for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess if these grenadiers manage to use up all of their ammo, they’ll
probably retreat from the fight, since the Bloodspear are supposed to be a
well-coordinated and more disciplined force than your standard orc band. You
might want to add a feature like a supply cart to the battlefield that would
allow them to reload, and would also be very flammable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bloodspear-krull&quot;&gt;Bloodspear Krull&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-clan-bloodspear-krull.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Krulls are named after a famous 80s fantasy movie that featured a weapon called
a Glaive, because they are Bloodspear martial artists who specialize in
glaives. That’s it. That’s the joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “glaive” from the movie was a cool throwing star thing, but the weapon
Bloodspear Krulls use is the equally cool &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; glaive, a polearm with a
single-edged sword blade at the end. They’re Level 5 Brutes with 78 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;glaive&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to make strong Reach 2 basic attacks, and it can also
be used in a &lt;strong&gt;Charging Sweep&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 6+) maneuver. This is a Close Burst 2
attack that deals the same damage as a basic attack, pushes targets it hits 1
square, and knocks them prone. As the name implies, it can be used as part of a
charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the krull bloodies an enemy, its &lt;strong&gt;Frenzied Strike&lt;/strong&gt; ability allows it to
make a free extra attack against that enemy. And when they drop to 0 HP, their
&lt;strong&gt;Charging Demise&lt;/strong&gt; ability lets them recharge and immediately use Charging
Sweep one last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bloodspear-ogrillon&quot;&gt;Bloodspear Ogrillon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-clan-bloodspear-ogrillon.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orgillons are half-orc/half-ogres. They’re smaller and smarter than a full ogre,
and almost as strong. These are Level 5 Elite Brutes with 156 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orgillons fight bare-handed. Their &lt;strong&gt;slams&lt;/strong&gt; do strong physical damage, and do
bonus damage against prone targets. On a critical hit, they knock the target
prone as well. As elites they can make &lt;strong&gt;Double Attacks&lt;/strong&gt;. They lack a Demise
ability, but their &lt;strong&gt;Brutish Retaliation&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to use a slam against an
enemy in reach that hits them with a ranged or area attack as a reaction. This
sounds a bit redundant when these attacks already provoke opportunity attacks,
but it at least lets the ogrillon save their opportunity action to attack
someone else. Or to hit the offender again when they try to move away after
landing that attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bloodspear-shiv&quot;&gt;Bloodspear Shiv&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skilled knife-fighters, shivs are Level 6 Skirmishers with 75 HP. They carry no
less than 12 &lt;strong&gt;daggers&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be used in melee or thrown. Their &lt;strong&gt;Shifting
Shank&lt;/strong&gt; ability lets them shift their speed and make a dagger attack at any
point during the movement. If this attack bloodies the target, they can make a
second free attack against that target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have the standard &lt;strong&gt;Savage Demise&lt;/strong&gt; ability as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bloodspear-half-troll&quot;&gt;Bloodspear Half-Troll&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-clan-bloodspear-half-troll.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like ogrillons, half-trolls are smaller and smarter than their troll parent, and
almost as strong. They also retain the infamous trollish regeneration
abilities. They are Level 8 Soldiers with 92 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half trolls have Regeneration 5 and Troll Healing, which lets them rise again
with 11 HP a turn after they drop. Acid or fire damage can prevent them from
healing for a turn, and can prevent them from rising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The half-troll’s &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; damage and grab on a hit (escape DC 16), and it can
grab up to two creatures at once. If a grabbed creature attacks the half-troll
or escapes the grab, the half-troll can &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; them as a reaction, an attack
that deals light physical damage. It also has the standard version of Savage
Demise, which could potentially trigger several times during the battle if the
PCs are too slow with their acid and fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bloodspear-savage-throng&quot;&gt;Bloodspear Savage Throng&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large unit of orcs with an unfortunate name, for use during the late Heroic
tier. It’s a Huge Swarm of Medium Natural Humanoids, and a Level 9 Brute with
117 HP. It follows all the standard swarm rules: half damage from single-target
attacks, 10 extra damage from area attacks, can occupy the same space as other
characters, and can move through any opening big enough for a single Medium
creature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The throng’s &lt;strong&gt;swarm attack&lt;/strong&gt; aura (1) is relatively weak, inflicting only 4
damage on anyone caught inside. As it also occupies the swarm’s own spaces,
though, it covers plenty of squares. Its basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Mob of Swinging
Axes&lt;/strong&gt;, and once per encounter it can pull off a &lt;strong&gt;Savage Frenzy&lt;/strong&gt; that attacks
every enemy in a Clost Burst 1, doing half damage on a miss. As with the aura,
the burst should also catch anyone who is inside the swarm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once at the start and once when first bloodied, the throng can make a
&lt;strong&gt;Trample&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver, which works as usual: move their speed and make an attack
against any enemy whose space they move through. The attack deals physical
damage and knocks prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;queen-msuga&quot;&gt;Queen Msuga&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Msuga is a Level 10 Elite Soldier with the Leader keyword and 212 HP. Her usual
speed of 6 becomes 8 when she charges. If the PCs fight her, she will surely be
alongside her sister Rohka and a sizable honor guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Msuga’s &lt;strong&gt;greataxe&lt;/strong&gt; marks the target for a turn on a hit, and she can perform a
&lt;strong&gt;Sweeping Blade&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) maneuver that attacks every enemy in a Close
Burst 1 for more damage than a basic attack, and even more against bloodied
enemies. This also marks everyone it hits for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a minor action, she can use &lt;strong&gt;Furious Onslaught&lt;/strong&gt; to order an ally within 10
squares to charge or make a basic attack as a free action. If a marked enemy
within 5 squares makes an attack that doesn’t target her, she can shift 5
squares to make a greataxe attack aggainst the offender as a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Msuga drops to 0 HP, &lt;strong&gt;Queen’s Demise&lt;/strong&gt; allows her or an ally within 10
squares to use a standard action for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rohka-the-blood-witch&quot;&gt;Rohka the Blood Witch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Rohka is most likely to be found alongside her sister Msuga,
and accompanied by a sizable honor guard besides. She is a Level 10 Elite
Controller with 216 HP. She has the usual ground speed of 6 and an effective
teleport speed of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohka fights in melee with her &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt;, but she prefers to stay at range and
fling spells. Her go-to is &lt;strong&gt;Chaos Displacement&lt;/strong&gt;, an area burst attack that
targets Fortitude, deals psychic damage, and slides targets 3 squares. Every so
often she can use the &lt;strong&gt;Baleful Eye of Gruumsh&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+), which targets 1
or 2 creatures and attacks Will. A hit deals psychic damage and slows (save
ends). After the first failed save this worsens to immobilization, and after the
second failure the target is dominated instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone hits Rohka with a melee or ranged attack and an ally is nearby, she
can use &lt;strong&gt;I Need a Volunteer&lt;/strong&gt; (encounter) to teleport and swap places with the
ally as an interrupt, making the attack target the ally instead of her. This
does mean the attack could &lt;em&gt;miss&lt;/em&gt; the ally if their defenses are higher. She
also has the standard version of Savage Demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I like this portrayal of Clan Bloodspear. They make a solid choice for
opposition because they’re ambitious and highly militarized imperialists with a
penchant for enslaving others. In fact, they make me think of Rome’s mythical
founding, since they’re led by two divinely-chosen siblings who are setting out
to build an empire where before there was “nothing” (i.e, a bunch of
civilizations who were minding their own business and were made targets for
invasion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining the stat blocks from this entry with the standard orc stats in the MV
gives you enough opposition to last you the whole Heroic tier. The book still
uses the word “savage” a little too often for my tastes, and there’s the “vile
half-breeds” thing, but I intend to change this if I ever use them in a game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Threats to the Nentir Vale: Calastryx</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-calastryx.png&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone in the Nentir Vale points behind you and shouts “Look out, a
three-headed dragon!” you should &lt;em&gt;always look&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in earlier posts that the Vale was first settled by people from
Nerath about three hundred years ago, and that the first area they settled is
now known as the Old Hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we hadn’t learned yet was that this settlement process was far from
peaceful. Back then, the Dawnforge mountains that make up the Vale’s eastern
border were home to a small community of chromatic dragons who considered all
they saw to be their domain. The first few attempts by human settlers to build
villages in the Old Hills were thwarted by dragon attacks, with great loss of
life and material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only when the settlers asked the dwarves for help that they succeeded in
establishing a foothold. The next wave came accompanied by a sizable dwarven
military force, which was quick to build the fortress of Hammerfast and use it
as a base to fight off the dragons. It didn’t take long for them to meet the
creature that was ultimately behind these attacks: Calastryx, the three-headed
red dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calastryx was too powerful for even the dwarven army to defeat, but they gave
the wizard Starris enough time to cast a curse upon the dragon, placing her in a
slumber that was supposed to be eternal. This allowed Nerath to finally settle
the Vale, and Hammerfast to eventually grow into one of its major cities. To
this day, no one knows the dragon’s history or why she has three heads. Does she
suffer from a genetic or magical mutation? Is she the creation of a cruel god or
of some other entity? Answers are thin on the ground, but your PCs just might
get the chance to ask her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, that curse held strong for three centuries but it’s starting to
weaken. It’s possible Calastryx will awaken in the near future. The region of
the Dawnforge mountains where her lair used to be is currently inhabited by the
Emberdark kobold tribe, who have their own share of historical beefs with the
Hammerfast dwarves. Their priests have begun receiving visions from Kurtulmak,
one of Tiamat’s Exarchs, speaking of Calastryx’s imminent awakening. The kobolds
have starting raiding nearby travelers and settlements with the aim of
gathering a treasure trove they’ll use to bribe their future mistress into
accepting their loyalty. You can already see some of their warriors wearing
shoulder pads that mimic extra heads, in honor of Calastryx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The star of the show here is clearly Calastryx, but we also get a stat block for
an Emberdark-specific kobold that you can mix in with the standard kobold stat
blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;emberdark-kobold-pillager&quot;&gt;Emberdark Kobold Pillager&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the Emberdark are pretty fond of fire, because this kobold here is
something of a fire-themed paladin of Tiamat. It’s a Level 4 Soldier with 55 HP
which, given the usual kobold level range, makes it one of their most powerful
champions. It has Speed 6 and Darkvision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pillager fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Flamebiter Spear&lt;/strong&gt; that deals fire damage, marks
for a turn, and makes it so targets that ignore the mark take 5 fire
damage. They can also cast &lt;strong&gt;Fire Dart&lt;/strong&gt; spells that do fire damage and mark for
a turn, though they don’t have a “punisher” rider attached to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the pillager hits 0 HP, it goes out in a &lt;strong&gt;Blaze of Glory&lt;/strong&gt;, making one
final spear attack as a free action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would probably turn the “take fire damage if you ignore the mark” rider from
the spear into a trait that applies to both attacks, because things can get
fiddly if you have to remember if a mark from the pillager has it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;calastryx&quot;&gt;Calastryx&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our star is a Huge Natural Magical Beast (Dragon) and a Level 14 Solo Brute with
684 HP. Level-wise she’s an adult red, but her actual stats differ quite heavily
from the standard dragon template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She still has the standard draconic &lt;strong&gt;Action Recovery&lt;/strong&gt; trait that ends any
dazing, stunning or dominating effect on her at the end of her turn. The new bit
here is that her &lt;strong&gt;Multiple Heads&lt;/strong&gt; give her &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; turns per round, at fixed
initiative counts of 30, 20, and 10. The only limitation here is that she cannot
delay or ready actions (something monsters rarely do in my experience) and she
only has one set of immediate actions between these turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her Reach 3 &lt;strong&gt;bites&lt;/strong&gt; damage and slide 3 squares. Her &lt;strong&gt;Breath Weapon&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 6+) does light fire damage, half on a miss, and creates a damaging
fire zone for a turn. She can also fire single-target &lt;strong&gt;Inferno Shots&lt;/strong&gt; at will
to deal heavy fire damage. Finally, &lt;strong&gt;Rip and Tear&lt;/strong&gt; is an encounter power that
allows her to bite up to three targets for slightly less damage than the basic
bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These actions seem a little weak, and they indeed are, fit more for a regular
monster than a solo. But remember that Calastryx get three full turns per round
to use them in. Each of her heads has a fully independent mind and they’re in
perfect coordination. The &lt;strong&gt;Power of Three&lt;/strong&gt; means each of them tracks their
Breath Weapon and Rip and Tear powers separately. So she actually gets three
uses of Rip and Tear per encounter, and three independently recharging uses of
her breath weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once she is first bloodied, Calastryx immediately grows a &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; head, which
from then on acts on initiative 40 with its own independently tracked breath
weapon and encounter power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calastryx might be much more wrathful than your typical red dragon, but she’s
still very smart. She will fight the PCs in places where she can herd them into
tight spaces to ensure they’re all hit by her breath weapons and bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calastryx shows us how far we can stretch the mechanics and still end up with
something that feels like a dragon, and I love her for it. Story-wise she’s
pretty much your standard slumbering kaiju. She could be an awesome final boss
for a campaign that ends at level 10, or a memorable “welcoming gift” for PCs
who just made it to paragon tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lengthier campaign focusing on Calastryx could present the threat of her
awakening early, and have its early conflicts be against the Emberdark
kobolds. It might even be possible to reach a diplomatic resolution with them
and get them onboard as allies against Calastryx when she finally awakens. I
mean, your typical dragon already doesn’t have a great track record of treating
its kobold lackeys very well, and Calastryx is even less inclined to do so no
matter the size of the tribute they present her with.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Threats to the Nentir Vale: Cadaver Collector</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-cadaver-collector.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure I saw these in a 3e supplement somewhere, but there’s a nifty
bonus stat block here that ties them to the Nentir Vale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cadaver Collectors are specialized constructs first built by ancient
necromancers to provide them with a supply of corpses. Their metal-plated bodies
are covered in long spikes that they use to impale collected corpses for
transport and delivery. They were commonly sent to “clear” battlefields after a
battle had ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many other constructs they’re pretty good at performing the job they were
designed for and at following instructions related to it, but they can’t do
anything else well. This is why no one sent them to fight in those battles. They
only follow the orders of their current master, or those of a person who also
serves that master.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original recipe for cadaver collectors was repeatedly lost and rediscovered
over the ages. No one in the Nentir Vale knows how to build one in our narrative
present, but there are several old ones still around in the wild. Many of them
are located somewhere within the Witchlight Fens, a swampy region in the
south-central Vale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a collector’s master dies it will usually fulfill the last order it was
given and then stand by waiting for more. If someone happens to die in their
assigned area in the meantime, they will dutifully go out to collect the
bodies. If someone manages to convince the collector they work for the
collector’s master, the creature will obey their orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enough time waiting for orders that never come, their programming might
mutate a bit, giving them a bit more initiative. Some collectors decide to go
looking for a new master to serve. Others decide to broaden their mission
parameters and consider living creatures valid targets for collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a hobgoblin necromancer named Gokof living in the Witchlight Fens who is
unusually skilled at convincing ancient cadaver collectors to work for him. He’s
nominally a member of the Daggerburg goblin tribe but spends most of his time
away from them and in the company of his collectors and undead servants. He
rarely has more than two collectors working for him at any one time, but never
seems to have trouble finding more to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get two stat blocks here, one for a cadaver collector and one for Gokof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cadaver-collector&quot;&gt;Cadaver Collector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These constructs are Large Natural Animates and Level 9 Elite Soldiers with 200
HP and a speed of 8. They’re immune to charm, disease, and poison, and have
Resist Lightning 10. They are somewhat weak to thunder damage: whenever they
take thunder damage, they become slowed (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectors attack with &lt;strong&gt;Slams&lt;/strong&gt; that deal physical damage and grab on a hit
(escape DC 20). They can grab one Large creature or up to four Small creatures
at once. As an elite it can perform &lt;strong&gt;Double Slams&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collector can also spend its action to &lt;strong&gt;Impale&lt;/strong&gt; a grabbed creature. This
deals massive damage, pulls them into the collector’s space, restrains them, and
inflicts 10 ongoing damage (save ends all). When the collector moves, the
creature is pulled along, and when the effect ends, the creature reappears in an
adjacent space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed that there’s a limit to how many creatures a collector
can &lt;em&gt;grab&lt;/em&gt;, but not to how many it can &lt;em&gt;impale&lt;/em&gt;. It’s not going to matter much
in practice, because it’s highly unlikely a collector will impale the whole
party at once. However, if it ever becomes relevant I’m inclined to say their
impaling limit is the same as the one for grabs. A fully loaded collector would
have four Medium cadavers impaled and another four grabbed. And would probably
have more than the two arms depicted in the illustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the collector can &lt;strong&gt;Trample&lt;/strong&gt; once per encounter like the big chungus
it is. The rules are as usual: it moves its speed and can cross enemy spaces
while doing so, making an attack that deals heavy physical damage and knocks
prone against every enemy whose space they cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectors fight by pretty much applying their programming to the PCs. Grab
impale, repeat. When fully loaded, trample to retreat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gokof-hobgoblin-necromancer&quot;&gt;Gokof, Hobgoblin Necromancer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gokof is a Level 9 Controller (Leader). He has speed 6 and low-light vision from
being a hobgoblin. He wields a &lt;strong&gt;Staff&lt;/strong&gt; as both weapon and implement, and has
an array of necromantic spells at his disposal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His basic ranged attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Necrotic Ray&lt;/strong&gt; that deals necrotic damage on a
hit and slows for a turn as an effect. Anything that happens “as an effect”
always happens, regardless of whether the attack hits or not! Less often
(recharge 5+) he can cast &lt;strong&gt;Sapping Tendrils&lt;/strong&gt; as a ranged area attack. This is
not selective, and on a hit it deals necrotic damage, immobilizes, and inflicts
ongoing necrotic damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of casting a spell, Gokof can use &lt;strong&gt;Command Animate&lt;/strong&gt; to order an
animate ally to make a melee basic attack as a free action. Cadaver collectors
are animates, of course, and so are a lot of undead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter, when an enemy within 5 squares of Gokof regains HP, the
necromancer can use &lt;strong&gt;Dark Healing&lt;/strong&gt; to automatically deal them a chunk of
necrotic damage and recover 24 HP himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, the existence of cadaver collectors shows that necromancy
in D&amp;amp;D requires an ideological commitment to the spread of undeath. These
constructs are more powerful and have a less ethically questionable nature than
most “servant” undead. They also take more skill to build, but their original
builders clearly &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; that skill. And yet chose to task their constructs with
collecting corpses for turning into zombies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the addition of Gokof to this entry. It helps establish a concrete
situation where cadaver collectors appear in the Nentir Vale. It’s also an
example of how a less “ideological” necromancer would come to control these
creatures. This is more than even most other setting-specific monster books
do. Those usually just say “these monsters exist in this setting”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boggles have been in the game since 1st Edition, when they appeared on the
Monster Manual II. This is their 4e debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boggles are mischievous humanoid fey. They’ve been around a very long time, and
are actually the common ancestors to both banderhobbs and mundane goblins! They
love playing cruel pranks on others, and move from the Feywild to the world
every time they find a fey crossing. The world’s mortals are so much more easily
fooled than the jaded fey of their home plane!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These creatures are naturally sneaky and have some capacity to bend space. It’s
common for a child to complain to their parents about a “bogeyman” who keeps
lurking just out of sight and disappears when looked at. Parents dismiss that as
a childhood fantasy right up until the boggle strikes. Common pranks include
spoiling milk, tying shoelaces together, setting clothes on fire, and all the
stuff you might have read in old real-world myths about the Fair Folk. At the
most cruel end that does include switching infants for swaddled animals or just
plain snatching children away. There are also some adventurer-specific pranks
like disassembling armor and hiding the pieces, or swapping brand new or magic
weapons for old and rusty replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all their cruelty, boggles are cowards, preferring to do their spying and
sabotage through those mini-portals they can create. They get nervous and
anxious when near other people, and this causes them to sweat profusely. Boggle
sweat is a very distinctive substance, viscous and slippery like grease. It’s
resistant to fire, though. Traces of it are often confirmation that boggles are
acting in a location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, stronger or smarter creatures manage to coerce boggles into working
for them. Left to their own devices, they associate only with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boggles are an early-Heroic threat suitable for introducing PCs to the more
fairy-tale side of fey opposition. They’re Small Fey Humanoids with ground and
climb speeds of 6, and darkvision. They also have Fire Resistance 5 from their
weird sweat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their signature traits are &lt;strong&gt;Dimensional Window&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows them to make
“remote” Thievery checks against creatures up to 10 squares away; and
&lt;strong&gt;Dimension Hop&lt;/strong&gt;, a move action that lets them teleport up to 3 squares. Even
tough they’re small, boggles have a long melee reach, because they hit you
through a tiny portal. All of their individual powers are also based around this
ability to create small dimensional windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;boggle-sight-stealer&quot;&gt;Boggle Sight Stealer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 3 Lurker with 37 HP. Its basic attack is a Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt;, and
its favorite move is the &lt;strong&gt;Peek-a-Boo Trick&lt;/strong&gt; a Range 10 attack that targets
Reflex. It does no damage, but it lets the boggle pull the target to a space
within 2 squares of it and to grab them. The target is blinded until the grab
ends, either by the target beating its escape DC of 13, or by the boggle being
more than 2 squares away from the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the boggle is grabbing a victim, it can use a &lt;strong&gt;Neck Bite&lt;/strong&gt; on them. This
attacks Reflex and deals heavy physical damage, half on a miss. If the victim
escapes the grab, the boggle can attack it with &lt;strong&gt;Face Rip&lt;/strong&gt; as a reaction,
automatically dealing a bit of physical damage and allowing the boggle to
teleport 3 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sight Stealers work very well against controllers and ranged strikers,
particularly if they have buddies that can keep the other PCs away from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;boggle-blink-trickster&quot;&gt;Boggle Blink Trickster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blink Tricksters are Level 4 Artillery with 43 HP. They’re the only artillery
monster I’ve seen that lacks a ranged attack! Instead, their basic &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; has
a, well, boggling Reach of &lt;em&gt;10&lt;/em&gt;, and enjoys the increased accuracy usually given
to ranged attacks from artillery monsters. This is an interesting implementation
because it means they’re not actually weak in melee and need not fear
opportunity attacks as much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the standard traits discussed above, blink tricksters can use a
&lt;strong&gt;Double Diversion Trick&lt;/strong&gt; to attack twice in one action. This recharges when
they’re first bloodied. And if they’re damaged by a melee attack, they can
dimension hop as a reaction once per encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;boggle-chase-trickster&quot;&gt;Boggle Chase Trickster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chase tricksters are Level 4 Skirmishers with 53 HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; have a more
typical reach of 2, and they have a couple of interesting movement powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foot-Snare Trick&lt;/strong&gt; is a minor action that can target an enemy flanked by the
boggle. It has an automatic effect: if the target moves more than 3 squares on
their next turn, they end that movement prone. This won’t do much good against
defenders, but it can ruin the plans of mobile strikers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chase Trick&lt;/strong&gt; is a reaction that triggers when the boggle is missed by a melee
attack. It can shift up to 3 squares and pull the attacker along with it. This
represents the creature tricking the attacker into chasing them, so the pull
does provoke opportunity attacks! If the attacker ends this movement without
taking damage, they can make a free attack against the boggle. The power
recharges when the boggle is first bloodied. It’s only worth using if the boggle
has plenty of other buddles hanging out nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;boggle-body-snatcher&quot;&gt;Boggle Body Snatcher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 5 Controller with 61 HP. It has all standard boggle traits
including a Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; attack. Its special move is &lt;strong&gt;Body Snatch&lt;/strong&gt;
(recharge 4+). It’s a non-damaging attacks that dominates on a hit (save ends)!
Until the target saves against this, the boggle is removed from play, and the
target gains a +2 bonus to hit and damage. When the effect ends the boggle
returns to play within 5 squares of the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, this thing works exactly like a Jockey from Left 4 Dead 2,
riding the victim and directing their movement. It’s also extra-sweaty: once per
round as a minor action it can leave a &lt;strong&gt;Boggle Sweat Stain&lt;/strong&gt; on the
ground. Each stain occupies a square and lasts until the end of the
encounter. Whenever a non-boggle enters a sweat-stained square, they
automatically fall prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like these creatures! Their lore gives them a proper fairy-tale monster feel,
and their mechanics are flavorful and interesting. My favorite is the Reach 10
melee attack from the blink trickster, with the body snatcher’s sweat stains
a close second.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Threats to the Nentir Vale: Bloodfire Ooze</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-bloodfire-ooze.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if these are from a specific adventure or if they’re original. This
is the first time I saw them. They are mostly generic monsters, but there’s a
couple of Vale-specific hooks here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloodfire oozes are created by evil rituals which mix the blood of sacrificial
victims with the blood of demons. The resulting creatures emit dangerous levels
of heat and like most oozes are always on the hunt for more organic material to
digest. They are able to recognize and avoid attacking their creator, and if fed
regularly are tame enough to be used as guards. They’re usually placed near
stone and metal traps or paired with other creatures that have a high resistance
to fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloodfire uses are rumored to prowl the Temple of the Yellow Skull in the
Ogrefist Hills area, and some of them were also found by dwarven miners under
Nenlast in the Old Hills. The latter were stored inside a giant iron statue of a
demon, and spilled out when the miners began dismantling it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloodfire Oozes are Large Elemental Beasts with the Ooze keyword, and level 7
elite brutes with 196 HP. They project a &lt;strong&gt;Bloodfire Aura&lt;/strong&gt; (2) that deals 10
fire damage to any creature caught inside, and their &lt;strong&gt;Demonic Fire&lt;/strong&gt; fire makes
all of their fire damage ignore the first 10 points of fire resistance possessed
by the target. As oozes, they suffer none of the usual penalties for squeezing
through tiny spaces. They are immune to fire and vulnerable 10 to cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oozes attacks are the traditional &lt;strong&gt;slam&lt;/strong&gt; (this time dealing fire damage) and
a &lt;strong&gt;Fiery Eruption&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) that attacks all creatures in a Close Blast 3
to deal light fire damage and ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ooze can also form faces on its surface, usually the faces of the victims
sacrificed to make it. These spew a &lt;strong&gt;Sulphuric Breath&lt;/strong&gt; as a minor action once
per round, attacking all creatures in a Close Blast 3 and dealing poison damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the ooze is first bloodied, it immediately recharges Fiery Eruption and
uses it as a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the monsters we saw through our readings have selective auras and area
attacks. The bloodfire ooze does not, which limits the selection of allied
monsters. Unless you want lots of, er, friendly fire to happen in your encounter
you need something with more than 10 fire resistance, and immunity is
preferred. As mentioned above, the most likely encounter is a pair of oozes plus
a hazard or two in the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impression&quot;&gt;Final Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more ooze type. They’re thematic for infernal or abyssal cults, and might be
a nice surprise to spring on players who load up on acid resistance when they
hear the word “ooze”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For added fun, you should run with the demon statue idea and stick a pair of
these things inside that one statue from the 1e PHB cover, making them jump out
as soon as the PCs pry out its gemstone yes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Threats to the Nentir Vale: Blackfang Gnolls</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blackfang gnolls first appeared as one of the antagonist groups in the
Thunderspire Labyrinth adventure. Here we get stats for Blackfang-specific
variants which combined with the MV could allow you to run that adventure with
updated stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;region-the-old-hills&quot;&gt;Region: The Old Hills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Hills take up part of the central and northeast regions of the Vale, and
have this name because they were the first area settled by the Nerathi. Its main
“points of light” are the dwarf hold of Hammerfast at its center and the human
settlement of Nenlast way up in the northeast corner. The Fiveleague House inn
near Hammerfast is a popular rest stop for travelers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in this area is Thunderspire, a tall isolated mountain whose peaks are
eternally shrouded in storms. It contains the entrance to a vast series of
underground ruins that used to belong to the ancient minotaur empire of Saruun
Khel. Go through that portal and a little ways into the underground, and you’ll
find the Seven-Pillared Hall, a community run by the Mages of Saruun, a cabal
who’s interested in profiting from trade between the people of the surface and
the Underdark. They enforce diplomatic neutrality within the Hall, but there’s
enough intrigue and backstabbing down here that it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; count as a
“point of light”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hall is described in detail in the &lt;strong&gt;Thunderspire Labyrinth&lt;/strong&gt;
adventure. This book assumes it hasn’t happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blackfang are a tribe of Yeenoghu-worshipping gnolls who live in the Old
Hills area of the Vale. They get this name from their distinctive fangs, which
are black and much longer than what is typical for gnolls. They frequently
attack travelers going through the area, with the aim of capturing people to
enslave and/or eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Hammerfast fears them, because it’s already lost too many warriors trying
to hunt them down. The Blackfang lair in complex tunnel warrens under the Old
Hills and avoid traveling overland whenever they can, preferring to use the
ancient tunnels of Saruun Khel to move about and to only emerge just before they
strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, Blackfang expeditions into the Saruun Khel ruins uncovered an ancient
temple known as the Well of Demons. The Well was dedicated to Baphomet, but the
Blackfang chieftain Maldrick Scarmaker locked himself inside in order to
rededicate it to Yeennoghu. While he’s in there, the Blackfang are effectively
leaderless and much less organized. However, it seems Scarmaker is close to
finishing his task, as the Well has started spitting forth demonic spirits that
possess certain members of the Blackfang. They call this the Butcher’s Blessing,
and it basically makes them into demons, giving them mutations like wings and
barbed tails. These “blessed” gnolls now seek to consume the souls of their
victims, and not just their flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stopping the depredations of the Blackfang could be a good hook for the
Thunderspire Labyrinth adventure, which is itself quite sandboxy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blackfang are gnolls, so they’re Medium Natural Humanoids and their
signature ability is &lt;strong&gt;Pack Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, giving them a +5 damage bonus against
targets adjacent to two or more of their allies. We see several group-specific
stat blocks below, and they combine well with the more generic gnoll stats
presented in other books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blackfang-feaster&quot;&gt;Blackfang Feaster&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one bites, and it doesn’t brush its teeth. Feasters are Level 6 Brutes with
89 HP and Speed 7. Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Ravening Bite&lt;/strong&gt; that deals poison
damage and slows (save ends). Against bloodied creatures they can skip straight
to the &lt;strong&gt;Devour&lt;/strong&gt; part, dealing heavy physical damage and knocking prone on a
hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple but effective, particularly if you take Pack Attack into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blackfang-gravedigger&quot;&gt;Blackfang Gravedigger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gravediggers illustrate the Blackfang preference for underground travel and
tactics. They’re Level 5 Lurkers with 48 HP. Their ground speed is 6 with Earth
Walk, and they have a burrow speed of 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;, which they can use as part of a &lt;strong&gt;Snatch From
Below&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver. To use this, they must be burrowing and have no creature
grabbed. It lets them burst up from the ground and make a bite attack ignoring
cover and concealment. On a hit, they grab the target (escape DC 15),
restraining it and inflicting 5 ongoing damage until the grab ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They pair well with enemies that can keep the other PCs’ attention elsewhere
while they gnaw on a squishy victim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blackfang-howler&quot;&gt;Blackfang Howler&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Howlers fight with whips and can imbue their howls with a bit of fear
magic. They’re Level 7 Skirmishers with 77 HP and speed 7. Instead of moving
normally, they can choose to &lt;strong&gt;Skulk&lt;/strong&gt;, shifting up to 4 squares. This makes
them hard to pin down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Whip&lt;/strong&gt; is reach 2 and can be used in a &lt;strong&gt;Whip Trip&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver, which deals
a bit less damage than a basic attack and knocks the target prone. Their &lt;strong&gt;Howl
of Dread&lt;/strong&gt; is a minor action that attacks a Close Burst 3 and immobilizes on a
hit. It recharges when they are first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blackfang-render&quot;&gt;Blackfang Render&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Renders specialize in fighting with their claws. They’re Level 8 Soldiers with
87 HP and Speed 7. Their &lt;strong&gt;Claws&lt;/strong&gt; damage and mark for a turn on a hit. They can
also use their &lt;strong&gt;Feral Grasp&lt;/strong&gt; to deal light physical damage and grab a target
(escape DC 16). Once they have grabbed someone, they can use &lt;strong&gt;Blinding Fury&lt;/strong&gt;
on the victim as a minor action, an attack dealing light physical damage and
blinding (save ends) on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have no specific abilities to punish someone who ignores the mark, so the
default -2 attack penalty against other targets is the only deterrent there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blackfang-hyena-pack&quot;&gt;Blackfang Hyena Pack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pack of hyenas! This is a Large Swarm made up of Medium creatures. It’s a
Level 6 Brute with 85 HP. It has all the swarm traits: resistant to melee and
ranged attacks, vulnerable to close and area attacks, can occupy other’s spaces
and counts as difficult terrain for them, can squeeze into any opening wide
enough for a single Medium creature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pack’s &lt;strong&gt;Swarm Attack&lt;/strong&gt; aura (1) deals 5 damage to enemies caught inside, or
10 if there are at least two allies adjacent to the enemy. Their basic attack is
a &lt;strong&gt;Bite&lt;/strong&gt; that damages and immobilizes (save ends). The condition also ends if
the pack is no longer adjacent to the target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;maldrick-scarmaker&quot;&gt;Maldrick Scarmaker&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-gnoll-maldrick.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leader of the Blackfang, fully enjoying the Butcher’s Blessing. PCs will
likely fight him inside the Well of Demons. If the GM decides to advance time
and say he succeeded in rededicating the temple, he could also be found at the
head of a raiding party alongside his honor guard. The book also suggests using
this stat block for his replacement if the group has already run through
Thunderspire Labyrinth, but personally I’m not a fan of keeping the status quo
the same in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Maldrick as presented here is Level 8 Elite Artillery with 148 HP. He’s
more or less equivalent to a warlock, and though his powers have familiar names
they’re all demonic in origin. He wields a &lt;strong&gt;mace&lt;/strong&gt; as a weapon and a &lt;strong&gt;rod&lt;/strong&gt; as
an implement. The mace can make decent basic attacks, but like any warlock
Maldrick will probably want to stay back and spam &lt;strong&gt;Eldritch Blast&lt;/strong&gt;. He can
also cast &lt;strong&gt;Dire Radiance&lt;/strong&gt; to deal radiant damage and prevent enemies from
closing (they take 10 extra radiant damage if they move closer to him in their
next turn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter he can cast an &lt;strong&gt;Infernal Moon Curse&lt;/strong&gt; at one or two
creatures, dealing heavy poison damage and keeping them immobilized 5 feet off
the ground for a turn. On a miss, this still deals half damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a PC warlock, Maldrick can use a minor action to place a &lt;strong&gt;Curse&lt;/strong&gt; on an
enemy, making all of this implement attacks deal 1d6 extra damage against it for
a turn. This stacks with Pack Attack, obviously. If an enemy enters a square
adjacent to him, he can use his &lt;strong&gt;Spined Tail&lt;/strong&gt; to make an opportunity attack
against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impression&quot;&gt;Final Impression&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final impression is the usual: a sarcastic “yay, more gnolls”. They are very
useful if you intend to run Thunderspire Labyrinth with updated rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have already run that adventure, these stats can still work to represent
Blackfang remnants, or gnolls from other tribes when combined with the more
generic stat blocks. I’d probably say that after Maldrick’s death at the hands
of the PCs, the remaining Blackfangs splinter into several mutually hostile
bands led by “blessed” gnolls who used to be his lieutenants.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read Threats to the Nentir Vale: Bitterstrike</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-tnv-bitterstrike.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2011 Wizards of the Coast.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/tnv/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This our first example of a “concrete” dragon, where they take the generic
information from the Monster Manuals and use it to make a specific atypical
individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a young white dragon came to the Nentir Vale. Making her lair
inside the nothern Winterbole forest, she frequently flew out to hunt and to
break things for fun, and eventually came to see the Vale as her own personal
buffet and playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lasted until the Tigerclaw barbarians who also lived in Winterbole decided
to stand up to her. Their chief was the great hero Fangstrike, who dueled the
dragon and manage to bury his war pick in her left eye. Wounded and humiliated,
the dragon flew away and spent the next thirty years sulking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience made her a cautious and vindictive. About nine months after
Fangstrike died of old age, she came back to wreak havoc on the tribe, killing
the chief’s surviving family and threatening the rest of the tribe with
destruction unless they paid her an annual tribute of treasure and a high-status
hostage. This how she came to be known by her current name of Bitterstrike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitterstrike made the same ultimatum to every other group of sapients who made
Winterbole their home: the Frost Witches, the Winterbole Treants, and the satyrs
who made the evergreen forest their home. Pay tribute and send hostages, or die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, Bitterstrike considers herself queen of Winterbole, and those annual
hostages make up her court. She uses them as agents and servants, and has them
keep an ear out for rumors and news from their original communities. If any of
these news sounds like an insult or threat to her, Bitterstrike becomes obsessed
with taking revenge on the offender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually this takes the form of a direct strike by the dragon, but Bitterstrike
is cautious enough to gather a posse of her vassals if she feels a solo attack
doesn’t have good odds. Whether alone or at the head of a posse, Bitterstrike
takes great pleasure in revenge and in the acquisition of more loot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the dragon queen is nowhere near the genius she thinks she is, and her
“vassals” view her more as a pawn than as a queen. Every single faction under
her control manipulates her into advancing their own goals by telling her false
information, and the Satyrs are in the habit of replacing the magic items in her
hoard with cheap mundane copies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PCs can come into conflict with Bitterstrike by trespassing into her hunting
grounds or offending her directly. It might also happen that they piss off one
of her “vassal” factions and they plant a few convenient rumors to sic her on
the party. Depending on how powerful the party is, she might bring in a few
elite vassals along for support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have stats for Bitterstrike herself and for the typical vassals or pets that
might accompany her. A lot of these are based on other existing factions we’ll
look at later, so you get a preview of what they can do right here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the vassals have Resist Cold 5 and Ice Walk, both necessary for survival
when hanging around Bitterstrike. All vassals and the dragon herself also have a
custom encounter power named &lt;strong&gt;Bitter Vengeance&lt;/strong&gt;, which triggers when an enemy
within 5 squares hits them with an attack. As a free action, they deal 10
automatic cold damage to the enemy and push them 2 squares. Bitterstrike’s
vengeance is more forceful and yeets the offender 7 squares instead. This makes
them all perfect to fight on maps that include hazardous cold-based terrain like
bodies of icy water or snow-covered pits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bitterstrike&quot;&gt;Bitterstrike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The White Wyrm of Winterbole is a Level 10 Solo Brute with 520 HP, Resist Cold
10, a ground speed of 6 with Ice Walk, and a flight speed of 6. She’s actually
the first MM3/MV-compatible adult white dragon we ran across in our readings, as
the MV only contained Young and Elder examples. Though she only has one eye,
that doesn’t affect her stats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a white dragon, she has an &lt;strong&gt;Action Recovery&lt;/strong&gt; trait that automatically ends
any dazing, stunning, or dominating effects on her when her turn ends, and
&lt;strong&gt;Instinctive Rampage&lt;/strong&gt; that gives her a free action at her initiative + 10
where she can move her speed, go through enemy spaces, and use a claw attack on
any enemy whose space she moves through. She gains Resist 5 to all damage during
this action, to better tank opportunity attacks. She also has a &lt;strong&gt;Savage Blood&lt;/strong&gt;
trait that makes her crit on a roll of 17-20 while bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitterstrike’s Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; deals cold damage, half on a miss. Her Reach 2
&lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; can attack two different creatures with one action. Her &lt;strong&gt;Breath
Weapon&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5+) is a Close Blast 5 that deals cold damage and slows (save
ends). On a miss it deals half damage and slows for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a flanking enemy hits Bitterstrike she can react with a &lt;strong&gt;Tail Slap&lt;/strong&gt; to
damage and push them 5 squares. The first time she’s bloodied, &lt;strong&gt;Bloodied
Breath&lt;/strong&gt; allows her to recharge and immediately use her breath weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitterstrike has Int 10, Wis 15, Cha 10. Every single one of her vassals listed
below has higher mental stats than her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;treant-vassal&quot;&gt;Treant Vassal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Winterbole treant, patterned after a coniferous tree, serving as one of
Bitterstrike’s vassals. It’s a Large Fey Magical Beast (plant) and a Level 8
Elite Soldier with 182 HP and a speed of 8 with Forest and Ice walk. It has
Threatening Reach 2, and a &lt;strong&gt;Wooden Body&lt;/strong&gt; trait that makes it take ongoing 5
fire damage (save ends) whenever it takes fire damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treant’s basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Slam&lt;/strong&gt; and it can &lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt;. It can
also use a &lt;strong&gt;Bitterwind Blast&lt;/strong&gt; that’s like a smaller version of Bitterstrike’s
breath weapon. It recharges when the creature is first bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an Essentials-style soldier, the Treant doesn’t mess with marks and can
instead use &lt;strong&gt;Pounding Branches&lt;/strong&gt; to attack any enemy in reach that makes an
attack that doesn’t target it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;satyr-vassal&quot;&gt;Satyr Vassal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This satyr is a Medium Fey Humanoid and Level 8 Elite Artillery with 136
HP and a speed of 6 with Ice Walk. As a bard-type, it’s surrounded by an aura
(5) of &lt;strong&gt;Cold Wind Song&lt;/strong&gt; that gives it +5 to defenses against attacks
originating from &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the aura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The satyr wants to stay really far away from its enemies, so it uses a Range 20
&lt;strong&gt;North Wind Bow&lt;/strong&gt; to attack. A hit deals cold damage and pushes the target 3
squares. Once per encounter it can pull a Hanzo and fire a &lt;strong&gt;Diving Dragon
Shot&lt;/strong&gt; that hits an Area Burst 2 within 20 squares. This deals cold damage, half
on a miss, and creates a zone that deals cold damage to any who end their turn
inside until the end of the encounter. If forced into melee, it can use its
horns to &lt;strong&gt;Gore&lt;/strong&gt;, damaging the target and knocking it prone, which should allow
for a quick escape to safer ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tigerclaw-vassal&quot;&gt;Tigerclaw Vassal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This barbarian from the Tigerclaw tribe is a shifter who’s pretty much always in
“shifted” mode. He’s a Level 8 Elite Skirmisher with 178 HP and Speed 6. His
&lt;strong&gt;Charging Pounce&lt;/strong&gt; trait gives him a 1d6 damage bonus on charge attacks and
allows him to use its normal actions after charging. Usually a character can
only use free actions after charging on their turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The barbarian fights with a &lt;strong&gt;Light Pick&lt;/strong&gt; and can use it to make &lt;strong&gt;Double
Attacks&lt;/strong&gt;. Once per encounter he can make a special attack named
&lt;strong&gt;Bitterstrike’s Slash&lt;/strong&gt; which deals heavy cold damage and ongoing cold damage
(save ends) on a hit. On a miss it slows and still inflicts the ongoing damage
(save ends). If an enemy ends their move flanking the vassal, he can use &lt;strong&gt;Wild
Instinct&lt;/strong&gt; to shift 1 square or move its speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;frost-witch-vassal&quot;&gt;Frost Witch Vassal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This elf sent by the Frost Witches is the smartest vassal in the bunch. She’s a
Level 10 Elite Controller with 204 HP and Speed 6. She emits a &lt;strong&gt;Chill Aura&lt;/strong&gt;
(1) that slows enemies caught inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The witch fights in melee with a &lt;strong&gt;Frost Touch&lt;/strong&gt; that deals cold damage and
slides 2 squares, and at range with an &lt;strong&gt;Icicle Shard&lt;/strong&gt; that deals cold damage
and immobilizes for a turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her big finisher is a &lt;strong&gt;Hailstone Hex&lt;/strong&gt; that deals cold and psychic damage. It
also forces the target to grant combat advantage and inflicts ongoing cold
damage (save ends both). While this effect persists, enemies of the witch that
start their turn adjacent to the victim suffer 5 cold damage. In other words,
it’s a miniature hailstone cloud following the victim around!  This recharges
when the witch is bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wild-coldscale-drake&quot;&gt;Wild Coldscale Drake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more of a pet than a vassal, as it’s a Medium Natural Beast and not
sapient. You can use these to fill out a vassal encounter. It’s a Level 8 Lurker
with 70 HP and Speed 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coldscale drakes have &lt;strong&gt;Snow Camouflage&lt;/strong&gt; that gives them partial concealment in
any icy terrain, and deal an extra 4d6 damage to any target that cannot see
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They need that boost because their &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; is a little weak without
it. Fortunately they can use their &lt;strong&gt;Snow Stalker&lt;/strong&gt; ability when on icy terrain
or within 10 squares of a white dragon to become invisible until after they make
their next attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitterstrike is a dangerous solo boss fight for a level 6 or 7 party. When
facing more powerful PCs she will bring enough elite vassals and coldscale
drakes to keep that level advantage. Most encounters against her should happen
in the Winterbole region, which will give her and her vassals a big terrain
advantage. Anyone level 5 or lower is seriously risking their lives by going too
deep into the Winterbole forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lore-wise, I like the dynamic of a somewhat stupid “queen” constantly
manipulated by her much smarter vassals.&lt;/p&gt;
