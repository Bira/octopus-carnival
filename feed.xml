&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is part of a series! Click &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already discussed the lore of the Eladrin &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/02/13/eladrin.html&quot;&gt;over here&lt;/a&gt;, along with how they
differ from your standard elves and from the celestials of 3e. I recommend
reading that post again for those basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Monster Manual 2 contains three more eladrin stat blocks, along with a bit
of additional lore on their society. I find it very funny that two of them
correspond to very popular elfy classes of editions past, debuting in 4e in the
form of monster entries. It would be some time before playable versions of them
were published, which I imagine must have made their fans quite anxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eladrin-arcane-archer&quot;&gt;Eladrin Arcane Archer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arcane Archers are more than just wizards who can shoot a bow. They practice an
art that’s seamless fusion of the two disciplines, and whose secrets are
jealously kept by certain eladrin societies. The Bow Mage minions we saw in the
MM1 are likely to practice the same style. This entry would represent a more
advanced, experienced, or narratively important practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think we ever explicitly got an Arcane Archer class in 4e. The Seeker
tries to implement the concept using primal magic but ends up not being very
effective. I think there’s also a way to build a Bard specializing in magic
ranged attacks with a bow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arcane Archers are Level 5 Artillery with 51 HP. Their speed is 6 and they have
low-light vision, along with the standard Fey Step power all eladrin get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a fight, they stay at range and repeatedly fire &lt;strong&gt;Scorching Arrows&lt;/strong&gt; from
their bows. This ability is kinda like a better version of the PC Ranger’s Twin
Strike, allowing them to make two attacks that target the lower of AC and
Reflex. The arrows have the same range as mundane ones, and individually deal a
low-ish mix of physical and fire damage. This adds up, though: an arcane archer
that consistently hits with both attacks punches a fair bit above its weight
class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also fire an arrow that explodes into an &lt;strong&gt;Eldricht Burst&lt;/strong&gt; (area burst
1 within 20 vs Fortitude; recharge 4+). This deals force damage and knocks
enemies prone on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eladrin-bladesingers&quot;&gt;Eladrin Bladesingers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, bladesingers. I first heard of them in 2e and I can’t remember a more
controversial class from that edition, at least here in the Brazilian fan
community. People either really loved them or really hated them. While I was
eventually convinced that their highly cinematic combat style was cool, I never
liked that they were an elf-only option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, 4e bladesingers are eladrin practitioners of an ancient martial art that
joins swordplay and magic. The resulting style resembles something a Jedi knight
or wuxia hero might use, employing lots of empowered sword strikes and
magic-assisted acrobatic maneuvers. Their code of conduct has elegance as an
important principle, so they put real effort into making their combat techniques
both graceful and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same code also compels them to behave honorably, so they tend to treat
opponents with respect and despise those who slaughter the weak and
defenseless. Despite this, there are many possible reasons for even a party of
good-aligned PCs to come into conflict with bladesingers: they might have
offended the eladrin’s liege, or a given group of bladesingers might have fallen
to the Dark Side of the Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get pretty close to a playable bladesinger by playing a Swordmage, and
apparently there was also a “bladesinger” class published late in the
edition. More obliquely, a Blade Pact Fey Warlock could also fit the concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers-1&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MM2 bladesinger is a Level 11 Skirmisher with 114 HP. They have a very nice
ground speed of 8, in addition to the low-light vision and Fey Step power all
eladrin get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They wear mail and wield a longsword, both of which are probably magical or at
least very high quality. Their basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Brilliant Blade&lt;/strong&gt; strike,
which deals radiant damage and gives the target a -3 penalty to attack the
bladesinger during the target’s next turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dance of Brilliance&lt;/strong&gt; is an at-will combination that allows them to make an
attack dealing light radiant damage, shift 3 squares, and make a basic Brilliant
Blade attack against another target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have two encounter powers. &lt;strong&gt;Crippling Strike&lt;/strong&gt; targets Fortitude and deals
no damage, but is guaranteed to slow the target even on a miss. On a hit it also
weakens them. In both cases the conditions are “save ends”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wyvern Strike&lt;/strong&gt; is much better, allowing the bladesinger to fly 8 squares
without provoking opportunity attacks and perform a strike at any poing along
the movement. This targets Fortitude, deals light physical damage, and 10
ongoing poison damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally there’s &lt;strong&gt;Combat Shift&lt;/strong&gt;. This allows them to shift 1 square as a minor
action, ending up adjacent to an enemy against which they have combat advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coure-of-mischief-and-strife&quot;&gt;Coure of Mischief and Strife&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time for more surreal fey nobility! Like “bralani” and “ghaele”, “coure” is a
noble title whose meaning can be a little confusing to mortals. One of the
reasons for this is that while most eladrin societies use the same names for the
titles, the actual rank they confer, and the amount of influence attached to
them, varies from culture to culture. So in this city state ghaeles might be the
rulers, but on that kingdom over there they’re just minor provincial nobles and
it’s the coures who call the shots. Attaining a noble title is rarely a matter
of inheritance - there’s a lot of mystery and mystycism involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever their rank, though, these titles always have some natural phenomenon or
abstract concept attached to them, like “autumn winds”, “winter”, or “mischef
and strife” in this entry. The noble in question will always have powers
relating to this area of influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, a coure of mischief and strife is a pointy-eared Loki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers-2&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This coure is a Level 17 Lurker with 129 HP. It has the usual low-light vision
and Fey Step ability, which in this case is completely redundant because the
coure also has a teleport speed of 6 to complement its ground speed of 6. It
wears leathers and fights with a &lt;strong&gt;rapier&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coure can become &lt;strong&gt;invisible&lt;/strong&gt; at will as a standard action, and this lasts
until it takes damage or &lt;em&gt;misses&lt;/em&gt; with an attack. If it attacks and hits, it
stays invisible! If for some reason the eladrin doesn’t already starts the fight
invisible, this is going to be its very first action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the invisible trickster is close to the party, &lt;strong&gt;Winds of Luck’s Mischief&lt;/strong&gt;
is a good fight opener: a Close Burst 3 vs. Will that does no damage, but makes
everyone it affects miss all attacks whose attack rolls were odd. This is a
“save ends” condition, so it might stick around for a while! Good luck trying to
damage an invisible enemy when half of your blows veer off course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While invisible the coure can also use &lt;strong&gt;Spark of Strife&lt;/strong&gt;, a Ranged 10 attack
vs. Will that deals psychic damage and is stronger than the rapier. A hit also
forces the target to charge its nearest ally, or make a melee basic attack if
it’s already close. This compelled attack is a free action, so it doesn’t eat
into the PC’s turn. However, if the compelled attack hits, the coure gets to use
Spark of Strife against the ally that was hit by it as a free action as well! A
series of lucky rolls is going to rapidly turn the party’s well-tuned battle
formation into a Three Stooges skit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounter here is level 10: 3 bladesingers, an eladrin twilight
incanter from the first MM, and a will-o’-wisp which I guess might be the
incanter’s familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love how the different eladrin celestial types from 3e became a bizarre system
of nobility ranks with a lot of that good faerie flavor. As one rises in rank,
one becomes less tied to the mortal world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Duergar</title>

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series! Go &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronologically, the first appearance of Duergar in 4e is in the Monster Manual
2, but they were also in the Monster Vault so we covered their basic lore
&lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/02/10/duergar.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In this post, we’ll covered the duergar that appeared in the MM2 but
weren’t updated in the MV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;previously-on-octopus-carnival&quot;&gt;Previously on Octopus Carnival…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your information, these are the duergar entries we covered &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/02/10/duergar.html&quot;&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt;:
Scout, Guard, Thug, Raid Leader, Infernal Consort, and Devil-Bred Duergar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This still leaves us with a sizable selection of stat blocks that didn’t make it
into the Monster Vault. They include some elite warrior types, and several
Hell-themed spellcasters that resemble either warlocks or clerics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw in that earlier post, all duergar share two signature traits:
resistance to fire and poison that increases with their level, and the ability
to shoot out their Infernal Quills at someone, once per fight as a minor
action. This has a Range of 3, does light physical damage and a tiny bit of
ongoing poison damage. It also inflicts a -2 penalty to attack rolls. A single
save ends both the ongoing damage and the attack penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;duergar-theurge&quot;&gt;Duergar Theurge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weakest of the spellcasters we’re going to look at here. Theurges wear robes
and wield warhammers in melee. At range they fight with a number of spells
themed around fire, smoke, and despair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the name they feel a bit more wizardly than the others, who are more
clearly priests of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theurges are Level 5 Controllers with 63 HP. They wear robes and fight with
&lt;strong&gt;warhammers&lt;/strong&gt; in melee. Their basic ranged attacks are &lt;strong&gt;Hellbolts&lt;/strong&gt; (ranged 10
vs. Reflex) that do fire damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have a few more powerful spells. &lt;strong&gt;Brimstone Hail&lt;/strong&gt; (recharge 5-6)
does fire damage over a fireball-sized area and knocks targets prone on a
hit. &lt;strong&gt;Vile Fumes&lt;/strong&gt; (recharges when first bloodied) does poison damage over the
same area and blinds for a turn on a hit. And &lt;strong&gt;Wave of Despair&lt;/strong&gt; is a daily
blast 5 vs. Will and does psychic damage, slows, and dazes (save ends both).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;duergar-shock-trooper&quot;&gt;Duergar Shock Trooper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shock troopers are somewhat similar to the guards we saw in &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/02/10/duergar.html&quot;&gt;the first
article&lt;/a&gt;, but stronger and more suited to open warfare. They wield mauls
instead of puny warhammers and have the ability to grow bigger when the fight
grows more intense!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers-1&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Troopers are Level 6 Brutes with 84 HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;mauls&lt;/strong&gt; have no special effects
aside from hitting hard, and their &lt;strong&gt;Infernal Quills&lt;/strong&gt; attack works as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When first bloodied, they can &lt;strong&gt;Expand&lt;/strong&gt; as a free action, growing to size
Large. This makes them take up 4 squares and pushes anyone who was adjacent to
make room for their new bulk. It also gives them a +2 attack bonus and a +5
damage bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;duergar-fleshtearer&quot;&gt;Duergar Fleshtearer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a name “Fleshtearer”, you’d expect this duergar to be a mindless berserker,
but it’s actually a sneaky magical assassin that fights with claws made of smoke
and can become invisible to better slice you with them and make your wounds
bleed faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-number&quot;&gt;The Number&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleshtearers are Level 11 Lurkers with 89 HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; also do ongoing
damage. If they have combat advantage they can instead attack with a &lt;strong&gt;Quill
Stab&lt;/strong&gt; that has the same effect as the signature Infernal Quills power as a
melee attack. This one recharges whenever the duergar hits with the basic claw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underdark Sneak&lt;/strong&gt; (minor action) requires them to be in dim light or darkness,
or adjacent to some cover. It makes them invisible for a turn or until right
after they attack. &lt;strong&gt;Shadow Scourge&lt;/strong&gt; is a passive trait that builds on this by
doubling the ongoing damage the duergar causes if it attacks from invisibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;duergar-hellcaller&quot;&gt;Duergar Hellcaller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This caster-type has focused their infernal magic on having the most fabulous
set of quills in the Underdark. They can fire quills all day long, unlike their
less well-endowed compatriots. Rounding out their arsenal is a small set of
diabolic curses and summoning spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers-2&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hellcallers are Level 12 Artillery with 96 HP. They wield &lt;strong&gt;maces&lt;/strong&gt; for
emergency, but as usual for artillery monsters the real interesting bits are the
ranged attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Infernal Quills&lt;/strong&gt; are an at-will Ranged 10 attack, and have the same
effects as the encounter version for other duergar. They can momentarily
increase their rate of fire to make this attack as a minor action, and to fire
off a &lt;strong&gt;Quill Storm&lt;/strong&gt; (area 2 within 10 vs. Reflex) that covers an area and
deals more ongoing damage than usual. Both of these special uses are encounter
powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once per encounter they can also conjure &lt;strong&gt;Asmodeus’s Ruby Curse&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast
5 vs. Will; enemies only) that deals psychic damage and slides those hits to the
outside of the affected area. This movement &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; provoke opportunity attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If someone manages to get close enough to make a melee attack against the
hellcaller, it can use &lt;strong&gt;Devilish Sacrifice&lt;/strong&gt; as an interrupt. This causes the
duergar to shift beyond the attack’s reach, and to summon a legion devil
hellguard into its former position. The attack targets the new minion, and if it
misses the devil gets to act right after the hellcaller in the initiative order
from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;duergar-blackguard&quot;&gt;Duergar Blackguard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This evil paladin-type uses its martial skills and magic powers to isolate and
pursue individual PCs across the battlefield. It wears plate and wields both a
shield and a warhammer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers-3&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 13 Elite Soldier with 260 HP. Its basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;Blighted
Warhammer&lt;/strong&gt; that deals damage as usual and triggers a secondary attack against
Fortitude with similar effects to the standard Infernal Quills power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blackguard’s own quills are a bit stronger than usual, replacing the
standard power with a &lt;strong&gt;Quill Burst&lt;/strong&gt; that does the same damage in a Close Burst
3 around the duergar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “isolate and pursue” part comes from a pair of abilities: &lt;strong&gt;Darkfire Mark&lt;/strong&gt;
(minor action 1/round) marks an enemy and compels it to approach and attack the
blackguard - if the enemy fails to do both in its next turn, it takes 10 fire
and necrotic damage. &lt;strong&gt;Infernal Footwork&lt;/strong&gt; is a reaction that allows the
blackguard to shift 2 squares in pursuit of an adjacent enemy who tries to get
away from it. If that enemy is marked, the blackguard also gets to make a hammer
attack against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;duergar-blasphemer&quot;&gt;Duergar Blasphemer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strongest priest-type we’ll see here, weaker only than the Infernal Consort
from the &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/02/10/duergar.html&quot;&gt;Monster Vault article&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Hellcaller, the Blasphemer also
has Big Quill Energy, though its other magic is more focused on disruptive mind
control effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers-4&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blasphemers are Level 14 Controllers (Leaders) with 140 HP who wield
&lt;strong&gt;greatclubs&lt;/strong&gt; in battle. Like Hellcallers, they can fire &lt;strong&gt;Infernal Quills&lt;/strong&gt; at
will and use a Quick Quill Strike once per encounter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the quills, they have three spells:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preach Submission&lt;/strong&gt; (Close burst 10 vs. Will; minor action 1/round) does no
damage but marks on a hit (save ends). An already-marked target is instead
knocked prone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eyes of Asmodeus&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 10 vs. Fortitude) also does no damage, but
weakens and marks for a turn on a hit. On a miss, or as an after-effect on a
hit, the target is slowed (save ends). This combos nicely with Preach
Submission to knock someone prone immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sinner’s Slip&lt;/strong&gt; is an interrupt that redirects an attack made against the
blasphemer to the attacker’s closest ally. If no allies can be targeted in
this way the attacker is instead knocked prone and takes some psychic damage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounter-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounter and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one sample encounter here. It’s Level 4, consisting of 2 guards, 1
scout, 1 theurge, and 4 orc drudges that are probably their slaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sure is a lot of duergar, and it further increases the variety and level
range of the available opposition if you want your PCs to go up against a whole
fortress full of them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Drakkoth</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-drakkoth.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series! Go &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drakkoths, also known as Dracotaurs, have been around since at least 3e. They
also look like something I’d find in some of the more exotic BECMI supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a number of other peoples, drakkoths are distant relatives of
dragons. Their humanoid half looks like a crested dragonborn, and their
quadruped half like a small wingless dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drakkoths are nomadic, somewhat insular and territorial, and have enough
technology to make steel weapons. Their preferred terrain are forests and
jungles, and the borders of their claimed territory tend to shift slightly over
time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the book some drakkoth communities worship Tiamat, but others
choose to venerate an individual dragon patron instead. This is most often an
elder or ancient green, given their common terrain preference. I imagine you
could have communities of Bahamut-worshipping or good-dragon-venerating
drakkoths as well. Some dragons actively seek to set themselves as the bosses of
a drakkoth community, because as far as potential servants go they’re a lot more
useful than kobolds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drakkoths are very strong and tough, and quite smart as well. They mostly fight
with weapons, to which they apply poison. They tend to wear hide and leather
armor, but you could also say their scaly hides are naturally tough if you’re so
inclined. Their superior movement speed means they favor “cavalry” and
skirmishing tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also breathe poison in a manner similar to a green dragon, and are
prone to flying into a rage that leaves them immune to pain when bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;common-traits&quot;&gt;Common Traits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drakkoths are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Reptile keyword. They have
low-light vision, and their four legs give them a respectable speed of 7. Though
all of them have a breath weapon and a rage ability, the exact effects vary with
each stat block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drakkoth-ambusher&quot;&gt;Drakkoth Ambusher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 13 Skirmisher with 131 HP. It fights with a Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;glaive&lt;/strong&gt;
that does a mix of physical and poison damage. It can also employ a &lt;strong&gt;Sudden
Rush&lt;/strong&gt; maneuver (move action; recharge 5-6), allowing it to shift its speed and
make attacks vs. the Reflex of every enemy it moves adjacent to. This does no
damage, but knocks prone on a hit. They also do extra “sneak attack” damage
against an enemy granting &lt;strong&gt;combat advantage&lt;/strong&gt; to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their breath weapon is a very dragon-like &lt;strong&gt;Venomous Hiss&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 2
vs. Reflex; recharges when first bloodied). It does poison damage, and ongoing
poison damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While bloodied the ambusher enters a &lt;strong&gt;Drakkoth Rage&lt;/strong&gt;, which makes it tougher
by granting it 10 temporary HP whenever it hits with an attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drakkoth-rager&quot;&gt;Drakkoth Rager&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Level 15 Elite Brute with 366 HP, the rager is a lot more direct in its
approach to combat. It wields a &lt;strong&gt;battleaxe&lt;/strong&gt; and can perform a &lt;strong&gt;Raging
Cleave&lt;/strong&gt; that does the same damage as the basic attack plus a bit of extra
poison damage in a Close Burst 1. It &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to be surrounded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its &lt;strong&gt;Venomous Hiss&lt;/strong&gt; and its &lt;strong&gt;Drakkoth Rage&lt;/strong&gt; have all the same effects as
those of the ambusher, but the rage also gives it a +2 to attacks and +5 to
damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drakkoth-venomshot&quot;&gt;Drakkoth Venomshot&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This archer is Level 16 Artillery with 125 HP, and carries a &lt;strong&gt;longsword&lt;/strong&gt; and a
&lt;strong&gt;longbow&lt;/strong&gt; into combat. Its arrows have a rider that gives the target
Vulnerable 10 Poison (save ends), which pairs nicely with the poisoned weapons
of its buddies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the standard Venomous Hiss, it can use a &lt;strong&gt;Venomshot Hiss&lt;/strong&gt; that does
less damage but can be used more often, recharging at the end of any turn where
the venomshot is bloodied. Its &lt;strong&gt;Rage&lt;/strong&gt; is the same as the ambusher’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to palling around with dragons, drakkoths also train creatures
native to their territories to fight alongside them, and they can make
short-term alliances with neighbors to take down powerful threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get two sample encounters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 14: a rager, two venomshots, and a viscera devourer. I bet there’s an
interesting story behind that one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 16: 3 ambushers, 2 venomshots, and a roc!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t even remember drakkoths existed before I got to this entry, but these
look interesting. I’m sure you could also reskin bog-standard centarus into
drakkoths and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Drakes</title>

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series! Go &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drakes make their debut on the first 4e Monster Manual, and this entry brings us
a few more of them. They remain a popular choice of animal for domestication but
the intro text mentions they retain a wild side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bloodseeker-drake&quot;&gt;Bloodseeker Drake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These expert trackers were included in the Monster Vault, so we already looked
at them &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/2020/02/01/drakes.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;horned-drake&quot;&gt;Horned Drake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wild, horned drakes are pack predators who spend most of the day sleeping
and basking in the sun, going out to hunt at night. They have an excellent
instinct for teamwork, and a pack of them is able to take down much larger prey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine that, when domesticated, they make stronger alternatives to the
bog-standard guard drake, treating their handlers as part of the pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horned Drakes are Medium Natural Beasts and Level 5 Skirmishers with 63 HP. They
have low-light vision and a speed of 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This drake’s basic attack is a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; that does standard physical damage and
allows the creature to shift 2 squares on a hit. The &lt;strong&gt;Pack Movement&lt;/strong&gt; reaction
also allows them to shift 2 squares when an enemy adjacent to them is hit by a
melee attack. This makes them great a setting up flanks with their fellow drakes
or with their handlers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drake can also make a &lt;strong&gt;Goring Horns&lt;/strong&gt; attack, which does high physical
damage and knocks prone on a hit. It also has a +1 attack bonus over the basic
attack, which indicates to me that it’s meant to be a charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, these drakes are set up charge an enemy, then surround and run circles
around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scytheclaw-drake&quot;&gt;Scytheclaw Drake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another species of pack predator, scytheclaws inhabit forests and
grasslands. They are known for their cunning and for their devious tactics. If
you see one scytheclaw, odds are there are two or three others approaching you
from behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, they’re Jurassic Park raptors!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers-1&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scytheclaws are Medium Natural Beasts and Level 10 Skirmishers with 105 HP,
which explains why the Jurassic Park protagonists had such trouble with
them. Their ground speed is an amazing 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is the titular &lt;strong&gt;Scytheclaw&lt;/strong&gt;, which deals physical damage
and knocks the target prone. If used against an already prone target, it hits
harder and inflicts 5 ongoing damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the drake hits with its basic attack, it can immediately use &lt;strong&gt;Springing
Step&lt;/strong&gt; (free action; recharge 4-6), which allows it to jump 8 squares and attack
someone else at the end of the jump. This doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks
from the target of the original attack, making it safe to move away from most
PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a prone enemy within reach tries to get up, its &lt;strong&gt;Overwhelming Attacker&lt;/strong&gt;
trait allows it to make an opportunity attack against that enemy. If this hits,
the target remains prone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scytheclaws are therefore set up to bounce between PCs while knocking them
prone, and they will absolutely kick you when you’re down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fang-titan-drake&quot;&gt;Fang Titan Drake&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you include the Raptors, you almost certainly have to include the T-Rex as
well. And sure enough, here it is. The largest species of drake, few creatures
other than dragons can pose much of a treat to them. Mostly solitary, they claim
large territories and chase away all other big predators, so ironically
creatures beneath the fang titan’s notice end up enjoying a measure of
protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most settings, such a creature would be impossible to domesticate, but in
D&amp;amp;D’s implied setting some sapients such as giants can manage it due to not
being that much smaller than them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-numbers-2&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fang Titans are Huge Natural Animals and Level 18 Elite Controllers with 348
HP. Their ground speed is 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their basic attack is a humongous &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; that can target one or two creatures,
dealing physical damage and dazing them (save ends). They can also grab one of
the targets on a hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can also attack with a &lt;strong&gt;Tail Sweep&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 2 vs. Reflex; recharge
4-6) that does high physical damage and knocks prone. Their &lt;strong&gt;Furious Roar&lt;/strong&gt;
works exactly like a dragon’s Frightful Presence, and when they’re bloodied they
recharge it and use it immediately as a free action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters And Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two sample drake encounters in this entry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 3: A lizardfolk hunting party with a pair of bloodseeker drakes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 19: A quartet of fire giants and their pet fang titan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned during my reading of the MM/MV, I love drakes and more of them
are always welcome. For many of them, it’s also easy to “de-skin” them as
dinosaurs if you’re so inclined, but making them a distinct type of creature
also frees the authors (and you!) from having to adhere to best paleontological
practices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series! Go &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silver dragons have been in the game since the days of AD&amp;amp;D 1st Edition, as part
of the classic metallic dragon set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silver dragons are described by the book as “the knights-errant” of
dragonkind. They like to travel the world looking for “interesting conflicts”,
and then throwing themselves at the center of those. When not doing that, they
chill in their lairs, which are usually in cold mountain-tops or in cloud
castles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silver dragons are highly susceptible to flattery, but get angry when the people
talking to them behave in an arrogant or aggressive manner. They breathe ice,
but they prefer to mix it up in melee. They can fly, but their flight is slower
than that of most other dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this kinda make me think of the “Outrageous!” incarnation of Aquaman from
the “Batman: The Brave and The Bold” cartoon. A silver dragon patterned after
him would be a true ally of justice who travels in search of wrongs to make
right, and who is also really loud and boisterous about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can still have ambiguous or evil silver dragons without changing the written
text, though. Note that it doesn’t make any mention of which side in those
interesting conflicts a silver dragon prefers to join. So a villainous one could
be a mercenary who’s interested in chances to inflict violence and who joins
whoever pays him the most (and the villains almost always have more money in
these scenarios).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, a silver dragon will want to be where the fighting is
thickest. They’re all about beating people up in melee, and the more surrounded
they are the better their offense becomes. Their cold breath weapon isn’t their
most damaging attack, but it makes enemies vulnerable to damage from other
sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silver dragons are Solo Brutes. They have darkvision, and cold resistance that
starts at 15 and increases by 5 in each subsequent age category. Their ground
speed starts at 6, increases to 8 at Adult, and to 10 at Ancient. Their flight
speed is always equal to the ground speed, making them indeed slower than other
dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their size progression is pretty standard: starts at Large, grows to Huge at
Elder and Gargantuan at Ancient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;young-silver-dragon&quot;&gt;Young Silver Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are Level 8 with 376 HP. They have the usual Reach 2 &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; as basic attacks, doing Brute-level damage. &lt;strong&gt;Dragon Onslaught&lt;/strong&gt;
allows them to make a claw attack against every enemy in range in a single
action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Breath Weapon&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude; Recharge 5-6) does light
cold damage and makes targets vulnerable 5 to all damage (save ends). &lt;strong&gt;Bloodied
Breath&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Frightful Presence&lt;/strong&gt; work as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dragon’s reaction skill is &lt;strong&gt;Wing Slice&lt;/strong&gt;, which triggers when it’s hit by
an attack from an enemy flanking it. It makes an attack vs. AC dealing light
physical damage to both the attacker and the other enemy flanking the dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adult-silver-dragon&quot;&gt;Adult Silver Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adults are level 15 with 608 HP. They have all the abilities of youngsters with
some upgrades and additions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragon Onslaught&lt;/strong&gt; adds an extra bite attack, so it’s a claw against everyone
in reach and a bite against a target of the dragon’s choice. They also gain
&lt;strong&gt;Threatening Reach&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing them to make opportunity attacks against anyone
they can reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elders-silver-dragon&quot;&gt;Elders Silver Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elders are Level 22 with 840 HP. They’re Huge, but their melee reach remains
at 2. They have bigger numbers and all the abilities of adults, with the
following two additions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tail Slam&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. AC) does high physical damage and dazes (save
ends). It’s also an at-will action!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unstoppable&lt;/strong&gt; is a passive trait that allows the dragon to roll extra saves
against ongoing damage at the start of its turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ancient-silver-dragon&quot;&gt;Ancient Silver Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancients are Level 29 with 1072 HP. It has all the abilities of an Elder, with
bigger numbers. It doesn’t gain new abilities, but its bite reach increases to
3, which benefits from Threatening Reach and also improves Dragon Onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounters play up the goodly tendencies of a silver dragon, pairing
it up with similarly “righteous” creatures. There’s a Level 8 encounter with a
young’un and 2 eladrin twilight incanters, and a level 17 one with an adult and
2 daeva zealots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other likely companions include dwarves, dragonborn, and angels. Mechanically,
you want monsters that can benefit from being shielded by a big brute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outrageous! I now totally want to include Arthur the Boisterous Heroic Silver
Dragon in my next game.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Iron Dragon</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-dragon-iron.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series! Go &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron Dragons were bit players in 3e, appearing in Dragon Magazine #356 seemingly
as part of an effort to make a dragon for each element in the periodic table. In
4e, they are promoted to the Monster Manual 2 alongside adamantine dragons to
replace the bronze &amp;amp; brass duo that was removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron dragons are kind of the black sheep of the metallic family, since unlike
most of their relatives they’re surly, anti-social, and underhanded. They lair
in isolated places and prefer terrain that contains plenty of hills, forests,
and other features that provide plenty of hiding spots for large predators such
as themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They still gather followers and henchthings with the promise of generous pay
and/or loot, but they see those as expendable dupes. They’ll send those
followers first to intercept any intruders, and will only join the fight
themselves if doing so looks like it will bring victory. If the hench-people are
severely outmatched, the dragon will get away and leave them to their fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might have gathered, iron dragons are sneaky and prefer to attack from
ambush. They breathe lightning, and their metallic scales become tougher the
older they get.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron dragons are Solo Lurkers, and have Darkvision like all other
dragons. They’re not actually very lurkery aside from a basic level of
sneakiness (Stealth training). Their abilities focus on damage mitigation with a
side order of control, all on top of the standard dragon loadout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young’uns start out Large, growing to Huge at Elder and Gargantuan at
Ancient. They have Resist Lightning 15, increasing by 5 per age category beyond
Young. Their speed starts out at 8 both in the ground and in the air, growing to
9/9 at Elder and 9/10 at Gargantuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;young-iron-dragon&quot;&gt;Young Iron Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young iron dragons are Level 5 with 268 HP. They have a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; that does a mix
of lightning and physical damage, and a &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt; that does about half that in
physical damage. The usual &lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to claw twice, allowing
them to spread some damage around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Breath Weapon&lt;/strong&gt; does lightning damage, as described earlier, and also
pulls 3 squares on a hit. Maybe it magnetizes the dragon for a moment?
&lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Breath&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Frightful Presence&lt;/strong&gt; are here and work as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also &lt;strong&gt;Wing Block&lt;/strong&gt;, an interrupt with triggers when the dragon is hit
by a melee attack. This gives the dragon Resist 5 against that attack, and
allows it to make a melee attack dealing light physical damage against the
attacker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adult-iron-dragon&quot;&gt;Adult Iron Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is Level 11 with 472 HP and all the traits of a youngster with bigger
numbers. No new abilities appear at this level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elder-iron-dragon&quot;&gt;Elder Iron Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elders are Level 19 and have 740 HP. They have all of the adult’s abilities,
again with bigger numbers all around. Their Double Attack turns into a &lt;strong&gt;Triple
Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing for three claw swipes with a single action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also gain &lt;strong&gt;Wing Defense&lt;/strong&gt; (minor action; recharge 5-6), which grants the
dragon a +2 bonus to all defenses for a turn. As long as it keep recharging,
they can keep using it every turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ancient-iron-dragon&quot;&gt;Ancient Iron Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancients are Level 26 with 992 HP. They have all of the elder’s abilities and
gain two new ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predator’s Response&lt;/strong&gt; is a reaction that triggers when the dragon is hit by a
melee or close attack. It allows the dragon to make a claw attack against the
triggering enemy and shift 2 squares. I now notice the dragon’s reach remains 2
even though it’s now Gargantuan. Either their limbs and neck are comparatively
tiny, or you should increase the reach for the Elder to 3 and the Ancient to 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron Wing Shroud&lt;/strong&gt; (minor action; recharge 6) allows them to make a close
burst 3 vs. AC attack dealing physical damage, and gain resist 15 to all damage
until the start of its next turn. While the damage resistance is active, the
dragon can’t make any attacks. I guess this represents the dragon hiding behind
its wings and catching surrounding enemies in the movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shroud’s “can’t make attacks” clause is less of a disadvantage than it
seems - an ancient iron dragon can make all of its attacks for the turn and use
the Shroud ability as its last minor action. It will lose access to opportunity
attacks and Predator’s Response, but will be able to act normally when its next
turn rolls around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two encounters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 7: A young iron dragon and 3 dwarf hammerers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 13: 1 adult iron dragon and 2 minotaur warriors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of them would follow the standard pattern I described in the Lore section,
with the lackeys being mercenaries lured by the promise of treasure, only to be
abandoned by their boss when the fight begins to go sideways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-impressions&quot;&gt;Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron dragons are the ones who least fit the classic metallic dragon stereotype,
which makes sense given their origins as an obscure magazine-only 3.x
dragon. Also I guess it’s hard to make a draconic Lurker who doesn’t sound shady
as fuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, I like that they’re here. That shadiness is one point in favor of them as
far as their utility in a story goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series! Go &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold dragons are the original metallics and have been around since the beginning
of D&amp;amp;D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold dragons are among the most powerful children of Io, with the oldest being
among the most dangerous creatures in existence. And yet they’re among the
dragons who most enjoy the company of mortals. I guess a lot of the “scholarly
metallic dragon” stereotype comes from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their preferred terrain are plains or rolling hills, but that’s a secondary
concern. Proximity to a sapient society, or to some great source of magic, are
much more important. Gold dragons like to rule, but it seems they don’t need to
make much of a fuss about it like the other dragons. It just happens! Any
community or society located in gold dragon territory will soon find itself
being heavily influenced or ruled outright by that dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold dragons are usually honest and fortright in their dealings, but the more
selfish ones don’t really care about the concerns of “lesser beings”. These
individuals tend to shape the societies under their influence to suit their own
long-term plans regardless of what the actual people who live there might
want. And of course, you can still find more traditionally “Good” gold dragons
out there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold dragons breathe fire, and as they age they gain more affinity with radiant
energy as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, we get a stat block for each significant age category of gold
dragon. They’re all Solo Controllers, and have Darkvision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young dragons start at size Large, with 15 fire resistance, a ground speed of 8,
and a flight speed of 10 with Hover. They gain another 5 fire resistance with
each subsequent age category, and their flight speed increases to 12 at
Elder. They grow to size Huge at Elder, and Gargantuan at Ancient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;young-gold-dragon&quot;&gt;Young Gold Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young Golds are Level 9 Solo Controllers with 380 HP. Their melee reach is 2,
and their basic attacks are a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; that does a mix of physical and fire
damage, and a weaker &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to claw twice in a
single action, bringing claw damage almost to parity with the bite. I guess it’s
good if they want to spread damage around rather than concentrate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an adjacent creature hits the dragon, it can hit back with a &lt;strong&gt;Fiery Wing
Riposte&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 1 vs. Fortitude), which pushes the impudent mortal 5 squares
and inflicts 5 ongoing fire damage (save ends).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Breath Weapon&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Reflex; recharge 5-6) does fire
damage and weakens (save ends), or half damage on a miss. &lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Breath&lt;/strong&gt;
and &lt;strong&gt;Frightful Presence&lt;/strong&gt; work as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adult-gold-dragon&quot;&gt;Adult Gold Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adults are Level 17 with 652 HP. As usual they have all the attacks of a
youngster with bigger numbers. This includes the ongoing damage from the
Riposte, which is now 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also gain a new ability: &lt;strong&gt;Burning Tomb&lt;/strong&gt; (area burst 1 within 20
vs. Reflex; recharge 6) is a spell that does the same fire damage as the breath
weapon, immobilizes (save ends), and creates a zone that does 15 fire damage to
anyone who starts their turn inside and can be sustained with minor actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elder-gold-dragon&quot;&gt;Elder Gold Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elders are Level 24 with a cool 888 HP. They have all the abilities of adults
with bigger numbers. Their Melee Reach increases to 3 due to their Huge size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is at the age where their radiance begins to have a game effect, giving
them a new ability: &lt;strong&gt;Beguiling Glow&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 8 vs. Will; enemies only;
recharge 5-6) is a minor-action attack that does no damage and pulls targets 5
squares on a hit, nicely setting them up for Burning Tomb or the breath weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also project an aura (2) of &lt;strong&gt;Weakening Flames&lt;/strong&gt;, which forces enemies
caught inside to choose between taking 15 fire damage or being weakened for a
turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ancient-gold-dragon&quot;&gt;Ancient Gold Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancient Gold Dragons are Gargantuan Level 30 Solo Controllers with 1088 HP. This
puts them on par with the friggin’ Tarrasque both in size and danger level. The
Tarrasque has more HP, but that’s before you apply the MM2 Solo HP fixes. And
the dragon is much smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have all the abilities of Elders with bigger numbers, including in reach,
aura size and damage, and ongoing damage from Riposte. Double Attack becomes
&lt;strong&gt;Triple Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing three claw swipes in one action. Their new
“capstone” skill is &lt;strong&gt;Ancient Radiance&lt;/strong&gt; (close burst 4 vs. Fortitude; enemies
only; recharge 6) which does radiant damage and dazes for a turn. After the daze
clears, the target gains Vulnerable 10 Radiant (save ends). This is important
because the dragon’s &lt;strong&gt;Breath Weapon&lt;/strong&gt; now does “fire and radiant” damage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold dragons surround themselves with allies and subjects that match their
individual dispositions. The evil ones employ beings such as evil minotaurs,
ogres and trolls as dumb disposable muscle. The good ones have a variety of
willing allies acting as guards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounters are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 10: a young gold dragon and 2 angels of valor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Level 19: an adult gold dragon and 3 savage minotaurs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Level-wise, these are certainly the most powerful of dragons. The Ancient is a
match for the Tarrasque and could put up a decent fight against beings such as
demon lords or other “campaign end bosses”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do have the same problem as the Tarrasque in that they lack strong
condition mitigation powers - that +5 to saves from being a solo might not be
enough to prevent stun-locking by an epic party. They also wouldn’t do so well
on their own against Demogorgon, so if you want to have a kaiju fight you might
want to use the dragon as an ally of the PCs instead of sending it in alone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Dragon, Copper</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-dragon-copper.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series! Go &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper dragons are part of the classic set and have been in the game at least
since the AD&amp;amp;D 1st Edition Monster Manual. Here, they are the only remaining
members of the “sorta orange-ish metal trio”, which used to feature bronze and
brass dragons as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper dragons are highly sociable creatures, but they’re also among the
greediest metallic dragons. They’re not likely to resort to outright robbery
like your typical red dragon, but they’re almost always looking for a way to
profit from their interactions with others. PCs can usually walk up to a copper
dragon and ask it for information or instruction. The dragon will be most happy
to give it to them… for a price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper dragons are quite protective of their hoards. They like to make their
lairs in rocky terrain like hilly badlands or mountains, which they can easily
patrol from the air but which restrict the mobility of land-bound intruders. If
they see the need to fight, they’ll do so by harassing their enemies with highly
mobile aerial attacks over an extended period of time. They breathe acid, and
prefer to recruit allies that can keep up with their high mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like it that the illustrations for copper dragons give then verdigris
streaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper dragons are Unaligned, Natural Magical Beasts with the Dragon Keyword. We
get stat blocks for the usual four age categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their size starts at Large when young, and increases to Huge at Elder. They
never reach Gargantuan size, which I guess means they’re a bit smaller than the
others in general. They have trained Perception, Darkvision, and Acid Resistance
that starts at 15 when Young and increases by 5 per age category. Their speed is
quite high, starting at 8 (fly 12) and reaching 10 (fly 14) at Elder and
older. They also have Overland Flight 15.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;young-copper-dragon&quot;&gt;Young Copper Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young copper dragons are Level 6 Solo Skirmishers with 296 HP. Their &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt;
allows them to shift 2 squares both before and after the attack, and deals a mix
of physical and acid damage. Their &lt;strong&gt;claws&lt;/strong&gt; are a simple basic attack, but
&lt;strong&gt;Double Attack&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to claw twice and then shift 2 squares. Looks like
choosing between a bite and a double attack is a meaningful tactical decision!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dragon’s most frequent attack is likely to be a &lt;strong&gt;Flyby Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, where it
flies its speed and makes a melee basic attack at any point during the
movement. This does not provoke opportunity attacks from the target of the
attack. The bite is the clear best choice here, since it’s stronger and has
built-in shifts which I think would happen even in the midst of the Flyby
Attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Breath Weapon&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Reflex; recharge 5-6) does acid damage
and slows (save ends). &lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Breath&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Frightful Presence&lt;/strong&gt; are also
here and work as described in earlier posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;strong&gt;Cutwing Step&lt;/strong&gt; is a reaction that triggers when someone moves to
a position that flanks the dragon. It’s an attack vs. AC that does light
physical damage and allows the dragon to shift 2 squares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adult-copper-dragon&quot;&gt;Adult Copper Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adult Copper Dragons are Level 13 Solo Skirmishers with 528 HP. They have all
the abilities of a young specimen with correspondingly bigger numbers. All
attacks that allowed shifts other than the bite have the shift amount increased
to 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also add a new passive trait: &lt;strong&gt;Unfettered Wings&lt;/strong&gt; allows them to roll
saves against the Immobilized, Slowrd and Restrained conditions at the start of
their turns in addition to the normal end-of-turn rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elder-and-ancient-copper-dragons&quot;&gt;Elder and Ancient Copper Dragons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Elder grows to size Huge as previously mentioned, and is a Level 20 Solo
Skirmisher with 760 HP. It has bigger numbers than the Adult due to its higher
level, but its suite of abilities is otherwise identical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ancient is a Level 27 Solo Skirmisher with an even 1000 HP. It has all of
the Elder’s abilities, and its &lt;strong&gt;Flyby Attack&lt;/strong&gt; upgrades to a &lt;strong&gt;Double Flyby
Attack&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows it to attack two different targets during its strafing
run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounters are against all-skimmisher teams. There’s a Level 8 one
with a young copper dragon and 3 hippogriffs, and a level 14 one with an adult
and 2 dragonborn raiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper dragons are really flexible in the dramatic roles they can occupy even
when you stick to their written description. It all depends on which part of the
“sociable but greedy” stereotype you want to emphasize. I also like that most of
their illustrations in this book have their coppery hides shot through with
veins of verdigris.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Dragon, Adamantine</title>
        <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-dragon-adamantine.png&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    Copyright 2009 Wizards of the Coast
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is part of a series! Go &lt;a href=&quot;/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the other entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adamantine dragons are the first metallics we’ll cover. I finally found a wiki
with publication histories for monsters, so I can say that that they first
appeared in a Monstrous Compendium for AD&amp;amp;D 2nd Edition, and in a Dragon article
for 3.x. This means they had a minor presence in the game until their first
proper Monster Manual appearance here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adamantine dragons like to lair in huge underground caverns, and can be found in
any sort of climate. They consider everyone else living in their claimed
territory to be their subjects, from whom they demand loyalty, respect, and
tribute. The flip-side of this is that adamantine dragons feel a genuine sense
of &lt;em&gt;noblesse oblige&lt;/em&gt; towards these subjects, and will protect them with all
their might.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their claws and fangs are made of their titular metal, so their attacks slice
through armor as if it wasn’t there. Their roars are powerful, and their breath
weapon is a focused sonic attack. In combat, they’re cool-headed and
tactical. If alone, they try to isolate weaker foes and focus fire on them. If
accompanied by allies, they’ll charge to the front line and attract the brunt of
enemy attacks to allow their allies more opportunities to damage the
opposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, we get stat blocks representing four age categories: Young, Adult,
Elder, and Ancient. All are Natural Magical Beasts with the Dragon keyword. All
stat blocks are Unaligned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adamantine dragons start at size Large, growing to Huge at Elder and Gargantuan
at Ancient. They have trained Perception, Darkvision, and Thunder Resistance
that starts at 15 and goes up by 5 on each subsequent age category. Their ground
speed starts at 6 and rises to 8 on Adult and older. Their flight speed starts
at 8 and rises to 10 on Adult and 12 on Ancient. They also have Overland
Flight 15, which is the speed you use when calculating how much distance they
cover over extended times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;young-adamantine-dragon&quot;&gt;Young Adamantine Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 7 Solo Soldier with 332 HP and the traits described above. Its
basic attacks are a &lt;strong&gt;bite&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;claw&lt;/strong&gt;, both of which target Reflex instead
of AC because they’re adamantine. The bite is a little stronger, &lt;strong&gt;Double
Attack&lt;/strong&gt; allows the dragon to claw twice in a single action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Breath Weapon&lt;/strong&gt; (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6) does thunder
damage and knocks the targets prone on a hit. It replaces the usual “half damage
on a miss” with a much more interesting Effect: at the start of the dragon’s
next turn, it gives a thunderous roar that deals automatic thunder damage to
everyone in a close burst 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Breath&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Frightful Presence&lt;/strong&gt; are here, and they work as
outlined in the intro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wing Buffet&lt;/strong&gt; (melee 2 vs. Fortitude) is a reaction that triggers when an
enemy enters or leaves an adjacent square. On a hit it deals light physical
damage and knocks prone. This is better than a standard opportunity attack
because it also triggers on a shift or other forms or movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adult-adamantine-dragon&quot;&gt;Adult Adamantine Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adults are Level 14 Solo Soldiers with 564 HP. Their numbers are of course all
larger, but they are almost identical to young dragons in what they can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been a few additions: the bite now also inflicts ongoing damage (save
ends), and Double Attack is replaced by &lt;strong&gt;Draconic Fury&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows them to
make three claw attacks &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bite a different target in a single action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elder-adamantine-dragon&quot;&gt;Elder Adamantine Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elders are Level 21 Solo Soldiers with 796 HP. They have everything adults have,
with a few additions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;strong&gt;Draconic Fury&lt;/strong&gt; gains another claw attack, for a total of four claws and
a bite. They also gain a new attack named &lt;strong&gt;Painful Resonance&lt;/strong&gt; (Ranged 20
vs. Fortitude; minor action; recharge 6) that inflicts ongoing thunder damage
and dazes (save ends). Since this is a minor action, it can be used in the same
turn as Draconic Fury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ancient-adamantine-dragon&quot;&gt;Ancient Adamantine Dragon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ancients are Level 28 Solo Soldiers with 1020 HP. This puts makes them a match
for a pair of primordial colossi. They have everything elders have, plus their
melee reach increases to 4 and the area of their Breath Weapon’s follow-up roar
increases to 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also gain a new trait named &lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Resilience&lt;/strong&gt;, which gives them
Resist 10 to all damage while they are bloodied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sample-encounters-and-final-impressions&quot;&gt;Sample Encounters and Final Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book doesn’t even pretend you’re going to fight these solos by themselves,
though that of course is an option depending on what you want. Since adamantine
dragons place themselves in the front line, they favor allies who can benefit
from the distraction to rain ranged damage or control upon the enemy, or give
the PCs the run-around and hit their squishies. And they’re going to think of
party composition in these terms, since they’re tacticians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sample encounter is level 15, an adult adamantine dragon and 2 banshrae
warriors.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Let's Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Dragons</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Woohoo, more dragons. The first Monster Manual (and the Vault) focused on
chromatic dragons, which are the classic draconic opponents, and now the second
one talks about the metallics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earliest metallic dragons were the Golds, who appeared alongside the
chromatic set in AD&amp;amp;D 1st Edition and might have been around even earlier than
that. Here, we’re going to look at a slightly different set. This is an
introductory post, with the next handful of them each covering a different
“color” of dragon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-lore&quot;&gt;The Lore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In editions past, metallic dragons used to be various shades of Good, something
which settings like Dragonlance really leaned into. Things are a bit more
complex here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metallics still venerate Bahamut in his role as the Platinum Dragon. They’re
more likely to interact peacefully with PCs and other sapients, but they can
still be quite full of themselves and are very protective of their territory and
treasure. If they perceive someone as a threat, they won’t hesitate to crush
that someone. And just like you can have friendly chromatics, you can also have
villainous metallics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In either case they tend to have a scholarly temperament. They prefer lairs that
have some cultural or academic significance in addition to the usual
requirements of isolation and defensibility and their treasure hoards are
curated like museum collections. The typical metallic dragon loves engaging in
learned discourse, and has a keen ability to sense lies. They deal very harshly
with people who try to fool or, gods forbid, steal from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all dragons they see very few other creatures as their peers, but will
allow a group of “lessers” to gather around themselves. They tend to see these
as students and wards, instead of slaves and worshippers. A metallic dragon is
not going to set itself up as a god, but as a &lt;em&gt;university professor&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This entry has five dragon types: Adamantine, Copper, Gold, Iron and
Silver. From what I gather, Adamantine and Iron dragons made it into the main
metallic lineup in 4e to replace bronze and brass dragons, which weren’t
distinct enough from Copper dragons at a glance. I think I agree with that
reasoning. While I’m sure these dragons have their own mechanical distinctions,
I sure can’t recall what they were just from looking at their names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-numbers&quot;&gt;The Numbers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual for dragons, the ones we get here are all solos, and each has several
stat blocks representing different age categories: Young, Adult, Elder and
Ancient. Young dragons only have the most basic versions of their powers, and
both improve them and gain new ones as they age. Their mechanical design is
closer to that of the first Monster Manual than to the one from the Vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All dragons have darkvision, resistance to the same element they breathe, and
both combat and overland flight speeds. All of them get a different &lt;strong&gt;Breath
Weapon&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as the &lt;strong&gt;Bloodied Breath&lt;/strong&gt; trait and the &lt;strong&gt;Frightful
Presence&lt;/strong&gt; attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloodied Breath works as usual: when the dragon is first bloodied, its breath
weapon recharges and it uses it immediately as a free action. Frightful Presence
is a Close Burst 10 vs. Will encounter power that does no damage but stuns for a
turn and has a -2 attack penalty (save ends) as an after-effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll begin discussing the dragon types individually in the next few posts.&lt;/p&gt;
