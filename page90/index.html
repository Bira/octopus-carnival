<p>Another fantasy classic, these lion-eagle hybrids have a different spelling for
their name in every source they appear in. D&amp;D has always gone with “Griffon”
and has featured them in its bestiaries since at least BECMI and AD&amp;D 1st
Edition. In Fourth Edition they appear only in the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A griffon is a large flying carnivore with the head, wings and foreclaws of a
giant eagle, and the hindquarters of some non-flying beast. They’re strong
enough to be used as flying mounts, though how easy they are to train depends on
the exact variety you’re dealing with.</p>

<p>The most common variety is called simply a Griffon, and has a lion’s
backside. They can’t be trained at all unless you start with a hatchling, but
stories tell that some elves and eladrin can use magic to control them and ride
them into battle. Griffon eggs fetch a high price on the open market (1000 GP)
from people who want a shot at training them, or who think they have that
eladrin magic figured out.</p>

<p>The ones you’re most likely to find as trained mounts are the Hippogriffs, who
have horse backsides and a considerably more tractable temperament. This makes
them the most common flying mount among the sapient people of the world. I’m
pretty sure Nerath had whole regiments of hippogriff cavalry and that the
practice survives in any post-imperial community of sufficient size.</p>

<p>Hippogriffs are brave enough that that they can readily be ridden into battle,
and they actually breed true with normal horses as well as with each other. The
offspring of a horse and a hippogriff will either be another hippogriff or a
temperamental horse. They’re expensive enough to be a prime target for thieves,
and there’s a thriving black market on young specimens.</p>

<p>Even the Elemental Chaos has its own griffon species in the form of the Rimefire
Griffon, a formidable beast that the book describes as being sapient, unlike its
natural cousins. It’s not exactly a genius at Int 4, but it still “allies” with
ice archons or gets “pressed into service” by efreets instead of being “tamed”.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Griffons are Large Natural Beasts with the Mount keyword (the Rimefire Griffon
is Elemental instead). They’re a bit slow on land, but are excellent fliers.</p>

<h3 id="hippogriff">Hippogriff</h3>

<p>The typical hippogriff is a Level 5 Skirmisher with 64 HP. It walks at speed 4
and flies at speed 10. Being a MM monster, it has a listed overland flight speed
of 15, fast enough to outrun most dragons.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a bite, and it can perform a Flyby Attack that works as
expected: the hippogriff flies it speed, attacks at any point in the movement,
and draws no opportunity attacks. It can also perform a Diving Overrun, a charge
which does more damage than the bite, knocks the target prone on a hit, and
lands the hippogriff adjacent to it.</p>

<p>As mounts, these creatures grant +1 to all of their riders’ defenses.</p>

<h3 id="hippogriff-dreadmount">Hippogriff Dreadmount</h3>

<p>An armored hippogriff that fights better on the ground. It’s a Level 5 Soldier
with 66 HP and the same speed as the standard model.</p>

<p>Dreadmounts trade their usual agility for increased battlefield control. They
fight with bites, and can do Wing Slams (Melee 1 vs. Reflex) against enemies who
try to shift or move away from them. These attacks are interrupts, doing some
damage and knocking enemies prone on a hit. They can’t be done while in the air.</p>

<p>Dreadmounts are also as stable as dwarves - they move 1 square less from forced
movement effects, and can roll an immediate save to avoid being knocked prone.</p>

<h3 id="griffon">Griffon</h3>

<p>Classic griffons are Level 7 Brutes with 98 HP. They run with speed 6, and fly
with speed 10.</p>

<p>Griffons fight with their claws, and they’re all about charging: charge attacks
give them a +4 attack bonus instead of the usual +1. When acting as mounts,
their charges allow them to make two claw attacks in addition to the rider’s
attack.</p>

<p>When bloodied, griffons lose their shit: they become immune to fear, gain an
extra move action, a +2 bonus to attacks, and a -2 penalty to defenses.</p>

<h3 id="rimefire-griffon">Rimefire Griffon</h3>

<p>These are Level 20 Skirmishers with 186 HP. Their land speed is 5, and their
flight speed 10. They have Resist 10 to both cold and fire.</p>

<p>Rimefire griffons have lion bits but fight more like hippogriffs, with a basic
bite that does physical and cold damage and the same Flyby Attack power. They
can also breathe fire (Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex), an attack that starts
“uncharged” but recharges after the creature hits twice with a bite attack. When
used as a mount, the rimefire griffon grants its elemental resistances to its
rider.</p>

<p>The lore description for the fiery breath is fun: their bites absorb the
target’s body heat, causing the creature’s prominent horn to glow red-hot. Once
it stores up enough heat, it can release it as a blast.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h3>

<p>The sample encounters emphasize the role of griffons as mounts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: a human mage and 2 human guards riding hippogriffs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 3 warforged soldiers and their dreadmount-riding captain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 2 eladrin fey knights on griffons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 20: 1 Ghaele of Winter riding a rimefire griffon, accompanied by a
quartet of fire and ice archons.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I like them, particularly the emphasis on them being mounts. I get the feeling
that investing in horses in D&amp;D’s implied setting is a fool’s game. You have
boar-riding dwarves, griffon-riding elves, human knights on hippogriffs, and I’m
sure there’s a ridable drake somewhere. Warhorses are so last edition.</p>

<p>I remember seeing Gricks for the first time in 3.0, but I wouldn’t be surprised
if they appear earlier than that. In this edition they’re only on the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In the previous post about Grells I complained that a lone grell was
indistinguishable from any of the many other tentacled underground
predators. Well, Gricks are one of those, and the main sources of my
confusion. They even have tentacles, a beak, and a short name that starts with
GR.</p>

<p>The main differences are that gricks are nonsapient and have worm-like bodies
instead of being floating brains. They live in caves and in the upper reaches of
the Underdark. There’s pretty much no chance for the PCs to have a nonviolent
interaction with these beasts (aside from sneaking around them, I guess). Gricks
are always either hungry and hunting, or hanging around their nests, which they
protect with murderous ferocity.</p>

<p>I note they don’t seem to have a burrowing speed, so they either need to stick
to premade caves and tunnels, or they burrow too slowly to make a difference in
combat. When food turns scarce in the grick’s preferred environment, they’ll
venture out to the surface to hunt at night, returning home before sunrise to
avoid burning out their tiny cave-adapted eyes.</p>

<p>Gricks are pack hunters and have excellent instincts for surrounding their
intended prey. They’re also really tough and hard to hurt. I wonder if bullettes
and gricks prety on each other, like sperm whales and giant squid.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two stat blocks here.</p>

<h3 id="grick">Grick</h3>

<p>The default model is a Medium Aberrant Beast and a Level 7 Brute with 96 HP. It
has Resist 5 against all effects that target AC, moves with speed 6, and climbs
with speed 4. It also has darkvision.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Tentacle Rake (Melee 1 vs. AC) that does both immediate
and ongoing damage on a hit (save ends).</p>

<p>It also has a trait named Expert Flanker that grants it a +2 attack bonus
against a target it’s flanking. That does stack with the standard +2 from combat
advantage, for a total of +4.</p>

<h3 id="grick-alpha">Grick Alpha</h3>

<p>A bigger, badder version leading a pack. It’s a Large Aberrant Beast and a Level
9 Brute (Leader) with 116 HP. It has the same damage resistance, senses, and
climb speed as the base grick, but its ground speed is 7.</p>

<p>The tentacle rake attack is almost identical, but has Reach 2 and also grabs the
target. The alpha can then use its standard actions to perform a Vicious Bite on
the grabbed target, doing automatic damage that’s a bit weaker than that of the
tentacles.</p>

<p>Why would it bother with that? Because it grants its allies a +2 attack bonus
against the grabbed victim. So while being chewed on by the alpha, the hapless
PC will also be attacked by the smaller gricks with a total bonus of +6: 2 from
CA, 2 from Expert Flanker, and 2 from this ability.</p>

<p>Of course, the alpha is an Expert Flanker itself.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>Gricks obviously don’t socialize with anyone outside their packs, but sometimes
an opportunistic predator will join a grick fight hoping to score some
scraps. They can also be enslaved by certain aberrant creatures, which seem to
be the only ones that can make any use out of these ornery worms.</p>

<p>Thus we get our two sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 1 grick alpha, 3 standard gricks, 2 dire stirges.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 9: 2 alphas, 1 gibbering mouther, and a trio of foulspawn.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like their mechanics, but the lore doesn’t inspire me all that much. They work
well enough as an incidental encounter for “natural cave” dungeons, I suppose.</p>

<p>Grells have been around since at least the 2e Monstrous Manual. In Fourth,
they’re only on the MM, but they got an update in Dungeon 192.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These beaked, tentacled brain-things live and hunt in the Underdark. Like a lot
of monsters in this book they’re carnivores who don’t mind if their prey is
sapient. Though blind, they perceive the world through their latent psychic
powers.</p>

<p>Grells are sapient, but lone grells tend to lead a feral existence and behave
pretty much like clever pretadors. Those tend to be exceptions, though. Grell
most often organize themselves in hive-like colonies with dozens of individuals,
led by the most intelligent and powerful among them. These colonies are
expansionist, though they tend to see their territory more as a hunting ground
than as any sort of empire. Grell colonies don’t go for subtle manipulation,
either.</p>

<p>Grells have a venomous bite, and venomous spines on the tips of their
tentacles. Their leaders are called Philosophers, and have stronger psychic
powers on top of that.</p>

<p>One interesting fact added by the Dungeon update is that brains are poisonous to
grells! They’ll eat every other bit of their victims, but will either discard
the brains or keep them in reserve for trade if there’s a mind flayer colony
near their territory.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Grells are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts who lack eyes and thus are immune to
gaze attacks. They have Blindsight 12 and fly with speed 6 (hover). A grounded
grell is reduced to a ground speed of 1 (clumsy). They’re Evil, communicate via
Deep Speech, and are trained in Stealth and Perception.</p>

<h3 id="grell">Grell</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 7 Elite Soldier with 156 HP. Its basic attack is a
Tentacle Rake (Melee 2 vs. AC) using those spines, and while it does the damage
expected by the new math that’s only because the designers went with the “one
double-damage attack” approach for this elite monster. In addition to doing
damage, the tentacles slow the target and give it a -2 penalty to attacks (save
ends both).</p>

<p>Instead of raking, the grell can attempt a Tentacle Grab (Melee 2 vs. Fortitude)
which does a bit less damage than the rake and grabs the target. The grell can
only grab one victim at a time, and enjoys a +2 bonus to AC while it’s grabbing
someone.</p>

<p>As a 1/round minor action, the grell can use its Venomous Bite (vs. AC) against
a grabbed victim, dealing a bit of physical damage and stunning them (save
ends).</p>

<p>You can expect a grell to be able to keep one PC stunlocked and the rest of them
slowed. The update gives them two attacks per turn, each of which can be a
Tentacle Rake or a Tentacle Grab. They retain their stunning bite, but the stun
also ends when the grab does in addition to being (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="grell-philosopher">Grell Philosopher</h3>

<p>Philosophers are Level 11 Elite Controllers with 224 HP. They have Resist 20
Lightning on top of the common grell’s traits. Their basic attack is still the
tentacle rake, whose damage is only 1 point higher than that of a standard
grell.</p>

<p>They have a ranged attack in the form of a Lightning Lance (Ranged 10
vs. Reflex) which does lightning damage and blinds (save ends). If there are a
lot of PCs nearby they can instead use their Venomous Mind (Close Burst 3
vs. Will, enemies only) which does psychic damage and forces its victims to
choose random targets for any melee attacks they make (save ends). I love these
unique conditions.</p>

<p>Occasionally the philosopher will be able to cause a Psychic Storm (Area Burst 2
within 10 vs. Will; recharge 6) which does psychic damage and dazes (save
ends). The storm lingers as a zone until the end of the encounter, dazing anyone
caught within (save ends).</p>

<p>Psychic storm is always available at the beginning of the fight, so that’s going
to be the opener almost every time. It’s not a “friendly” area, so some care is
required in its placement. Venomous mind is an excellent power to use on the PCs
stunlocked by the philosopher’s underlings.</p>

<p>The dungeon update left them pretty much identical, aside from the usual damage
improvements.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s one grell encounter here, which is level 11: a philosopher, 2 standard
grells, and 4 troglodyte minions. The lore didn’t give me the impression grells
would work alongside anyone else, but the troglodyte association here is
interesting. This works as a good boss battle for level 8-9 characters.</p>

<p>I think grells are a lot more interesting when they’re in colonies. As lone
feral predators they’re interchangeable with a lot of other tentacled Underdark
beasties.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed is that 2e seems to have described them as having a higher
level of technology: they worn spear-tips on their tentacles, used magic items,
and the Lightning Lance was an actual weapon instead of a psychic power. I
wonder how much stress this caused GMs whose players looted a bunch of +5 rings
and rayguns from a group of grells. So in that way it’s a good thing that these
things are no longer in the game. Still, if you’re looking for some treasure to
assign to a grell encounter, these items might be a good inspiration.</p>

<p>2e used to also have Grell Patriarchs as the “tier” above
Philosophers. Patriarchs were large sapient masses of flesh that acted as the
core of spelljammer vessels. If you’re including spelljamming in your campaign
you could bring them back.</p>

<p>In Greek mythology, the Gorgons are a trio of sisters whose bodies were partly
composed of snakes and whose visage could turn people to stone. Medusa was one
of the Gorgons (the other were Stheno and Euryale). If you say the word “Gorgon”
to anyone, they’ll probably think of Medusa, unless they’re D&amp;D players.</p>

<p>D&amp;D uses the word “Medusa” as a species name for the snake-haired ladies, and
“Gorgon” for these carapaced cows with a poison breath. They, in turn, are based
on a monster from medieval European folklore whose poison gas came out of the
other end. They appear only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>There isn’t much to go on here. Gorgons are elemental beasts known for their
foul temper and deadly breath weapons. In the wild they roam in small herds of
3-7 individuals made up of one bull and his harem of cows. Young males acquire a
herd by challenging and defeating its current bull. Those who fail at this roam
alone or in pairs and are likely even more aggressive than usual.</p>

<p>Taming gorgons is quite hard, but it happens. Those who most often succed at it
are other elemental creatures, particularly giants.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gorgons are Large Elemental Beasts whose signature traits are Truesight and a
complete immunity to forced movement and being knocked prone. They also have a
breath weapon of some sort, though its effect varies with the stat block.</p>

<h2 id="iron-gorgon">Iron Gorgon</h2>

<p>This is the one that’s closest to the “classic” D&amp;D gorgon of editions
past. It’s a Level 11 Soldier with 120 HP and the common traits listed above. It
has the Earth keyword, runs at Speed 6 with Earth Walk, and is immune to
petrification.</p>

<p>The iron gorgon’s basic attack is a Gore, though I imagine it will most often
Trample instead. This allows it to move its speed, go through enemy spaces, and
perform an attack against any enemy whose space they go through. This is a
little weaker than the gore but will likely target multiple PCs. The movement
draws opportunity attacks as normal.</p>

<p>Ocasionally, the iron gorgon will perform an Earthshaking Charge (recharge 5-6),
which does more damage than the basic attack and pushes a Medium or smaller
target 3 squares, also knocking it prone.</p>

<p>Finally, it can use the Petrifying Breath that made it famous (Close blast 3
vs. Fortitude; recharge 6). It does poison damage, dazes and slows (save
ends). This worsens to immobilized on the first failed saved, and to permanent
petrification on the second. Other gorgons are immune to this breath weapon,
which means they don’t have to worry about friendly fire when you fight the
whole herd.</p>

<h2 id="storm-gorgon">Storm Gorgon</h2>

<p>Explicitly called out as the favorite herd animal of storm titans, the mighty
storm gorgon is a Level 26 Skirmisher with 248 HP and all traits listed
above. To them it adds a Tempest’s Fury aura (size 5) that does 20 lightning
damage to anyone caught inside, which is impressive even for an epic
creature. It also has 20 lightning and thunder resistance, runs at Speed 8 and
flies at Speed 10 with hover capability.</p>

<p>Its basic gore attack does a mix of physical and thunder damage, and also always
pushes the target 2 squares and knocks it prone on a hit. It can use that as
part of a Mobile Melee Attack where it moves its speed without drawing
opportunity attacks and makes an attack at any point in this movement. They can
also Trample like iron gorgons if they want to spread the hurt more widely.</p>

<p>Their breath is a storm (Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude), which does a whole bunch
of lignthing and thunder damage but doesn’t have any riders.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter here is level 27: 2 storm gorgons, 1 storm titan, and 2
dragonborn champions. I imagine this is a lord taking a walk with his favored
pets and their minders. Yes, the Dragonborn Champions are pet minders - anyone
less tough would be killed by those storm auras.</p>

<p>Confusing naming conventions aside, I quite like these deadly bovines. They’re
in dire need of a damage fix, of course, and I would probably shift the
conditions on the iron gorgon’s petrifying breath around. Something like slowed
-&gt; immobilized and dazed -&gt; petrified.</p>

<p>How about some fan-made gorgon lore? I imagine they’re native to the Elemental
Chaos, and were brought to the world by the giants way back when. Wild specimens
can be found in both planes, descended from escaped members of giant herds who
went back to nature.</p>

<p>While storm gorgons (below) are explicitly called out as being a favorite of
storm titans, I imagine hill giants would be just as fond of iron
gorgons. Those groups who grow adept at gorgon ranching have less reason to raid
neighboring settlements for food. Their territories might be full of giant-sized
statues left over from the process of becoming adept at gorgon-ranching too.</p>

<p>You know who else might be good at herding gorgons? The githzerai. They’d have
to be if they use animal products at all. Normal cattle would have trouble
surviving in the Elemental Chaos.</p>

            <p>Over- and undersized weapons are a popular trope for fantasy and
fantasy-adjacent stories. Those giants and pixies need something to fight with,
and human-scale warriors with huge swords is a itself a popular genre trope.</p>

<p>GURPS already has a pretty good set of cinematic rules for representing
these. The best source of these is the <em>Scaling Weapons and Armor</em> section found
in <strong>GURPS Low-Tech Companion 2: Weapons and Warriors</strong>. GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
uses a limited subset of those in DF1 and 3.</p>

<p>However, there are a few other tropes that mess around with weapon weights in a
supernatural way. Let’s take a look at how to represent them in GURPS.</p>

<h2 id="superheavy-weapons">Superheavy Weapons</h2>

<p>This is a melee weapon that’s the same size as its mundane counterpart, but it’s
a lot <em>heavier</em>. It’s probably made out of a non-standard material, which
depending on the weapon might be a fruit of superscience or magic. Such weapons
are usually built for legendarily strong wielders! The increased weight not only
makes the weapons more deadly, but also allows its owner to employ their full
strength when fighting.</p>

<p>To model these weapons, use the Scaling Weapons and Armor rules, with a few
modifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Either pick a final weight for the weapon, or note the strength of its
intended wielder if you already know that.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Go to page 21 of Low-Tech Companion 2, and pick the line whose “Typical User
ST” column most closely matches that of the wielder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you started with the weight, divide final weight by the “base” weight of
the weapon and pick the line whose Weight column is closest to the result.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modify the weapon’s Damage, required ST, Weight and base cost as written in
LTC2. <em>Do not</em> modify Reach or SM.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And there you have it! And yes, you can combine this with normal weapon scaling
to make a weapon whose weight is abnormally large for its size. In that case,
two extra steps apply after completing the procedure above:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Multiply the weapon’s Reach by the value in the table row corresponding to the
SM of the intended wielder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cost is the <em>higher</em> of the weapon’s final modified cost, or the cost of a
standard SM 0 weapon.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: We’re making a super-strong martial artist character and we want
him to use an iron quarterstaff that’s ten times heavier than the wooden
variety. Looking at the table on LTC2 p. 21, we see that the closest multiplier
is 12.25, for the SM+3 line.</p>

<p>After applying the modified process above, we end up with a weapon that has the
following qualities: Damage sw+7 cr or thr+7 cr; Reach 1, 2; Parry +2; Cost
$122,50; Weight 20kg (40 lbs); ST 25. So our hero would need at least ST 25 to
properly wield such a weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: We’re making a pixie barbarian using Dungeon Fantasy rules. Her
ST is 13, which is legendary for a people whose SM is -6 and whose typical ST
score is 5. We want her to wield a weapon that’s superheavy <em>for a pixie</em>.</p>

<p>The chosen base weapon is a Dueling Halberd. We use the SM -6 row in the table
for the halberd’s Reach multiplier, and the SM -2 row for everything else. Our
resulting halberd will weight only a quarter of the human version, but it will
be 25 times heavier than a “standard” pixie polearm, and weight more than its
wielder! Since its modified cost of $30 is lower than its base cost of $150, it
costs the same as a full-sized halberd.</p>

<p>The final stats are: Damage sw+2 cut or sw+2 imp or thr+2 imp; Reach C; Parry 0U
or 0; Cost $150; Weight 1.25kg (2.5 lbs); ST 6++. Note that our super-strong
pixie can wield this halberd one-handed without it becoming unready.</p>

<h2 id="magically-attuned-weapons">Magically Attuned Weapons</h2>

<p>This trope is popular in the Exalted roleplaying game. Magic weapons in that
setting are based both on some tales of classical mythology and on modern media
such as action anime and certain video games. The heroes who wield these weapons
“attune their essence” to them, which makes the weapons feel like they have
normal weight to their owners, while still being superheavy to everyone else -
particularly their targets.</p>

<p>This means that characters wielding these weapons don’t have to be generically
super-strong, and that the ability to handle one weapon doesn’t give them the
ability to wield others.</p>

<p>To create such a weapon, use the same process outlined above for “superheavy”
weapons. Attunement is represented by a new advantage, which the weapon’s owner
must purchase in order to use it.</p>

<h3 id="attunement-variable-cost">Attunement (Variable Cost)</h3>

<p>You’re attuned to a specific magical weapon which is super-heavy, oversized, or
both. You can wield it just as if it was a normal-sized weapon, though its
targets will still feel the full weight of your blows.</p>

<p>To calculate the cost of this advantage, subtract your actual ST from the
weapon’s minimum ST and multiply it by 1.6, rounding up. Add 1 to the total if
the weapon is also oversized.</p>

<p>Attunement in no way “protects” your weapon! If it’s permanently lost or
destroyed, you lose all the points invested in it.</p>

<p><em>Details</em>: This is just enough levels of Lifting and Striking ST with the
limitation “Only for this weapon” (-80%) to cover the difference between the
character’s ST score and the minimum ST for the weapon. The extra point for
oversized weapons is a specialized version of the Giant Weapons perk that
removes all penalties due to size difference, but only works for that single
weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: If the Iron Staff from the previous section was a magic artifact in
the style described here, a reedy ST 8 hero could attune to it by paying 28
character points. 25 - 8 is 17, which multiplied by 1,6 gives us 27,5, which is
then rounded up. This allows the hero to fight with the Staff as if he had
ST 25, and to ignore its great weight when carrying it, but he’ll still be ST 8
for all other purposes.</p>

<h2 id="whomsoever-wields-this-hammer-should-he-be-worthy">“Whomsoever wields this hammer, should he be worthy…”</h2>

<p>The third and final special weapon covered in this article are those powerful
magical artifacts that only allow those they deem worthy to even lift
them. Thor’s hammer from the Marvel comics and movies is a famous example.</p>

<p>Lifting and using these weapons is not a matter of muscle mass, but of moral
strength. When you touch them, they judge you! If you pass that judgment, then
you can lift and wield the weapon as if it was a normal specimen of its kind.</p>

<p>You don’t actually need to make these weapons superheavy or oversized. Instead,
they look for certain traits in a prospective wielder. Those who have these
traits are worthy. Those who don’t can’t even lift the weapon, even if they’re
the strongest being in the universe muscle-wise. I generally consider this to be
a story effect and wouldn’t try to put a price tag on it.</p>

<p>A weapon like movie-Mjolnir might look for one or more virtues along the lines
of Honesty, Selfless, Charitable and so on. An evil weapon would instead look
for Bloodlust or Sadism. They would of course also avoid traits opposite to
those they like.</p>

<p>If the weapon in question is also superheavy or oversized, then it could grant
worthy wielders the ST to use it, similar to how Attunement works, at no cost to
the wielder. If you’re writing up the weapon as a character, this would be a
benefficial Affliction granting the Attunement advantage described in the
previous section of this article. Simplify its cost by having it grant a number
of levels of ST equal to the minimum needed to wield the weapon regardless of
the wielder’s current ST.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: The Iron Staff belonged to the Monkey King! Though it will shun
Bloodthirsty, Callous, Greedy or Sadistic individuals, it will deem worthy
anyone who shows its former master’s heroic spirit, martial prowess, or love of
mischief. Anyone with at least two of Selfless, a Code of Honor or Higher
Purpose to fight evil, Trained by a Master, Curious, or Trickster could be
deemed worthy and be considered to have ST 25 when wielding the staff.</p>
