          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2018/04/02/my-gurps-house-rules.html">My GURPS House Rules</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As a way to get back into the habit of writing I thought I would expound a bit
on my preferred GURPS house rules. These are the modifications I make on every
campaign I GM. Some are tried-and-true, some are experimental, and one I haven’t
really used yet but intend to.</p>

<p>None of them are original creations, though. There’s so much stuff out there
already that I don’t feel inclined to come up with my own stuff.</p>

<h2 id="the-permanent-fixtures">The Permanent Fixtures</h2>

<p>These rules should be in effect in pretty much any game I GM.</p>

<h3 id="metric">Metric!</h3>

<p>If I have one complaint about GURPS is that it uses Imperial measurements for
everything. I don’t! I use metric instead. By now I’m pretty used to applying
simple conversions for lengths and weights.</p>

<p>Areas and volumes are more annoying, though I suspect <a href="http://bignose.whitetree.org/projects/gurps/house-rules.devel/gurps-metric.xhtml">this site</a> would help
me there. I don’t agree with <em>everything</em> on it (for example, I’m not rounding
Basic Lift to the nearest whole kilogram, that’s not granular enough), but it
does a good job overall.</p>

<h3 id="alternate-guns-specialties">Alternate Guns Specialties</h3>

<p>These are from Pyramid #3/65. It greatly simplifies the existing Guns
specialties, and I think it makes a lot of sense. I use it on any game that has
guns at all.</p>

<h2 id="occasional-appearances">Occasional Appearances</h2>

<p>These don’t always appear, but I like them nonetheless.</p>

<h3 id="complimentary-skills">Complimentary Skills</h3>

<p>This rule originally appeared on GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 2 and GURPS Action 2, and
was restated on Pyramid #3/70. It encourages teamwork, and gives heroes a bit of
an extra edge in general. It hasn’t appeared in all of my games because people
rarely think to invoke this rule, but if anyone asks whether they can use it the
answer is always “yes”.</p>

<h3 id="tactics-for-the-win">Tactics For the Win</h3>

<p>This originally appeared in GURPS Martial Arts. It allows the Tactics skill to
grant rerolls when not using tactical maps, or to enable tricky positioning
shenanigans when using them. It makes playing “warlord” characters mechanically
viable, and the only reason it’s not a permanent fixture is that people don’t
always make those types of character.</p>

<h3 id="team-efforts">Team Efforts</h3>

<p>Another one from Action and Dungeon Fantasy. It simplifies group tests.</p>

<h3 id="range-bands">Range Bands</h3>

<p>This is from GURPS Action. It’s a lot easier to use than the Size/Speed range
table for combats without a map! In practice it mostly means giving nearly
everyone a -3 penalty for ranged attacks and calling it a day, since combats in
my games rarely happen further away 20m that even when everyone has guns.</p>

<h2 id="experiments-tried-and-untried">Experiments, Tried and Untried</h2>

<p>These are rules I <em>want</em> to use more often, but I still don’t feel I’m good
enough at applying them to so in every game.</p>

<h3 id="technical-grappling-simplified">Technical Grappling, Simplified.</h3>

<p>This is obviously from GURPS Technical Grappling. I like the basic idea of the
Technical Grappling system, but as written it’s way too complex to use in any
game that is not entirely about playing through an entire MMA tournament at a
high level of detail.</p>

<p>I would like to keep the central mechanic where grapplers to “control damage”
according to their skill and strength, and where this damage makes it
increasingly harder for the opponent to move. Referred Control has to <em>go</em>,
however, and I strongly dislike the idea of adjusting people’s ST mid-fight. I’m
also not too keep on calculating multiple ST scores for every possible
combination of limbs you’re using for a grapple.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’m strongly tempted to buy Douglas Cole’s Dungeon Grappling
supplement for D&amp;D-alikes and port it back to GURPS, since it seems to do lot of
what I described above already. However, now that I’ve discovered that the
<a href="http://www.sjgames.com/ill/archive/April_01_2018/Announcing_Hall_of_Judgment_for_Dungeon_Fantasy_RPG">official GURPS conversion of his Hall of Tyr adventure</a> is real, I’ll
probably wait for that instead. In the meantime I might work something out on my
own.</p>

<h3 id="hybrid-ritual-path-magic">Hybrid Ritual Path Magic</h3>

<p>I’m a big fan of the Ritual Path Magic system as described in, well, GURPS
Ritual Path Magic. I like the energy accumulation model and the flexibility it
allows. That book is more geared towards settings where magic is rare and/or
hidden, though, which means it tends to limit magic by what is “mundanely
possible” in the setting in question. You can exceed those limits with Greater
effects, but it’s expensive.</p>

<p>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 19: Incantation Magic describes a variant of this system
meant to fit a D&amp;D-like setting, where magic is known and common. The limits it
imposes are a lot less fuzzy (you can do <em>this</em> much damage, or give <em>this</em> big
a bonus). The exact amounts are dependent on Magery and there are no Greater
effects that allow you to exceed them. That’s good for my purposes, but
unfortunately the system is based on an “effect shaping” model where spells give
you more skill penalties the more powerful they are.</p>

<p>What I want here is a hybrid system, one that’s based on energy but also geared
towards obvious-magic settings. What I’d do here is basically use the system
from RPM with the Magery-based limits from DF, and the removal of Greater
effects. I haven’t tested this in actual play with real players, but I would
like to.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In this post I continue to write up the Pathfinder iconic characters for use in
the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game. Links to all of them will appear in the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">project page</a>, which also contains links to the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
versions.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Swashbuckler, which means today’s character is
Jirelle. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Jirelle.jpg"/>

</figure>

<p>Even if you’re familiar with Pathfinder’s Iconics, Jirelle might be somewhat new
to you. This is because the class she represents, the Swashbuckler, is not from
the core rules but from the “Advanced Class Guide” supplement. You can find her
bio <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5lg5a?Meet-the-Iconics-Jirelle">here</a>, and the only place where I could find her stats is inside <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9a64">this
free package of premade iconic characters</a> that contains all of them.</p>

<p>From these, we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Jirelle is a half-elf born in the Shackles, a pirate-infested archipelago. She
sunk her evil pirate’s mother ship to avoid becoming a demonic sacrifice, but
the ship and its whole crew later returned as undead. Her main long-term goal
is returning them to the depths.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her fighting style is acrobatic and daring, relying a lot on precision and
fencing skill.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She wields a rapier as her main weapon, and despite the illustration showing
one of every traditional off-hand fencing weapon on her person, the character
sheet indicates the buckler is her favorite.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This version of Jirelle is pretty much identical to the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/19/pathfinder-df-swashbuckler.html">GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy</a> version, with the main difference being equipment. Her armor and
buckler are a lot heavier, and thus I was forced to perform a little point
shuffling to get her an Armor Familiarity perk. She’s still as good at fencing
as ever, though.</p>

<p>One thing I noticed here is that the DFRPG version of Rapier Wit uses the
Intimidation skill rather than Public Speaking. I don’t think it would be a
stretch to allow it to be used with Public Speaking, so I’m keeping that skill
here. If your GM sticks to the letter of what the book says, feel free to move
those Public Speaking points to Intimidation instead.</p>

the <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">project page</a>, which also contains the links to the GURPS Dungeon

<p>Today’s template is the Martial Artist, which means today’s character is Sajan
the Monk. Here he is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Sajan.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I think he looks pretty cool! His <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Sajan_Gadadvara">bio</a> and <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/sajan.html">official stats</a> give us the
following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>He was born in Vudra, his world’s India analogue, where he was a member of the
warrior caste along with his beloved twin sister Sajni. Even after they were
posted to separate barracks at the age of 12 they still met regularly to spar
and hang out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sajni was given away as part of a peace agreement, and Sajan ran after her. He
tracked her down to Absalom, his world’s “big cosmopolitan city”, and has been
looking for her since.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a monk he’s quite acrobatic and prefers to rely on his flurry of blows in
combat. He might also grapple or trip opponents with his hooked “temple
sword” if that’s more tactically advantageous.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/13/pathfinder-df-monk.html">GURPS Dungeon Fantasy version</a> used the stats for a khopesh from GURPS
Low-Tech for the “temple sword”. Since this one is restricted only to the
material in the DFRPG boxed set, we go with the Heavy Falchion stats and give up
on the rules for weapon hooks. We also had to lose the gauntlets, as his light
cloth armor is a bit heavier here. Sajan continues to be a very effective
combatant either with his sword or with his fists, and has most of the abilities
people have come to associate with monks in d20.</p>

<p>This is an entry in the Dragon’s Dogma bestiary. You thought I had droppped
this, didn’t you? The remaining entries along with the full adaptation can be
found <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Like gryphons and chimeras, hydras are a heraldic animal in Gransys, symbolizing
endurance in battle. Hydra sightings are vanishingly rare, for not many of these
monsters exist in Gransys and even fewer people who saw one up close lived to
tell the tale.</p>

<p>A Gransys hydra looks like a gigantic four-headed snake, covered in shiny black
scales. Its four necks tower over the ground at the height of a cyclops, and its
main body is even larger. Its four heads can spit a jet of numbing poison, and
and swallow a grown man whole. Despite this, the creature lacks substantial
fangs and its jaw muscles are more suited for immobilizing victims than for
outright crushing them. Should the hydra have need of crushing someone, though,
it can simply slam its heads, necks, or tail into the victim.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 50; <strong>DX</strong> 13; <strong>IQ</strong> 5; <strong>HT</strong> 15;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 60; <strong>Will</strong> 12; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 15;</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Head Slam (15)</strong>: 6d+3 crushing; Reach C-4; The hydra slams one of its heads
into the target.</li>
  <li><strong>Miasma Spit (15)</strong>: A 2 meter radius area of effect in front of the
hydra. Targets exposed to the venom must roll HT. Success means 1d injury,
failure means 2d. Targets also suffer a -1 penalty to DX for every 2 injury
sustained, which lasts for 1 minute. Costs 2 FP per use.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (15)</strong>: The target is grappled with ST 52! In subsequent turns the
hydra will attempt to swallow the target (treat it as an attempt to pin). See
Notes below for how to rescue a swallowed target.</li>
  <li><strong>Tail Sweep (15)</strong>: 6d+3 crushing with double knockback; Targets a 3 meter
radius area of effect behind the hydra. Can only be dodged, not parried or
blocked!</li>

<h2 id="hydra-tactics">Hydra Tactics</h2>

<p>The hydra can do <em>something</em> with each of its heads each turn, or give up one
head’s action for a tail sweep. Each head counts as a separate individual for
the purposes of being targetted with mind-affecting spells or the like.</p>

<p>Despite its feasome size and prowess, a hydra has the mind of a beast. It will
usually attack because it’s hungry! In these cases, its usual tactic is to
impair one of more targets with its Miasma Spit, then bite and swallow them. It
will retreat once it has had its fill or suffered significant injury.</p>

<p>Hydras are also highly territorial and will fight any who trespass on their
lairs to the death.</p>

<h2 id="fighting-a-hydra">Fighting a Hydra</h2>

<p>A cumulative 15 injury from cutting weapons to a neck will sever one of the
hydra’s heads. 2d seconds later, the head will grow back, and the hydra will
regain the lost HP. The stump must be burned with natural or magical fire to
prevent this from happening! Severing and cauterizing the last head will of
course kill the beast.</p>

<p>Someone swallowed by a hydra can still be saved in the 10 seconds it takes for
them to travel down the beast’s neck if the offending head is severed before
then. If they reach the creature’s body they will automatically take 6d+2 cr
damage per second from its innards, which practically guarantees a swift death.</p>

<h3 id="giant-climbing">Giant Climbing</h3>

<p>It’s possible for a brave or suicidal warrior to climb the neck of a hydra! It’s
skin is mostly smooth but still provides some handholds, giving a -2 to any
Climbing rolls. Someone clinging to the neck of a hydra can target the neck at
no penalty with a one-handed melee weapon, but the beast can still attempt to
crush the pest by slamming its neck against the ground. Treat this as a “Head
Slam” attack. The target has a -2 penalty to Dodge it unless they let go of the
hydra.</p>

<h2 id="hydra-variants">Hydra Variants</h2>

<h3 id="archydra">Archydra</h3>

<p>The original game also features the “Archydra” in its most difficult dungeons,
beyond the Rift. This variant is white instead of black, harder to hurt, and
does have fangs. It has DR 9 in the neck and 12 elsewhere and can bite for 6d+2
imp damage instead of grappling if it wishes.</p>
