Chuuls are large lobster-like beings with yellowish shells, a semi-upright
posture, and a mass of little red tentacles dangling from their faces. They're a
mainstain of the Underdark in every edition they appear in, including this
one. They are only on the Monster Manual.

Chuuls are Aberrant Magical Beasts (aquatic). We saw the aquatic keyword
already, back when we read about aboleths, but I don't think I explained
it. Aquatic creatures suffer no penalties for operating underwater and usually
have a swim speed. They also get bonuses when fighting non-aquatic enemies
underwater.

As magical beasts, chuuls are sapient. They're not very smart, with Int 4, but
they're conversant in Deep Speech. They lurk in underwater lakes, still pools
and other sufficiently large bodies of stagnant water, and emerge to snatch prey
with their huge claws.  Chuuls don't care if that prey is sapient, and will eat
every single part of their bodies except for the brain, whose taste the
creatures dislike. Predictably, this makes them good neighbors to mind flayers,
who will use a chuul pool as a dumping ground for brainless bodies.

Chuuls are only statted in the Monster Manual, and we get two varieties here.

The classic **Chuul** is a Level 10 Soldier. It's Large, has darkvision and both
a walking and a swimming speed of 6. Its basic attack is a claw whose damage is
exactly half of what it should be for its level, but that's surprisingly okay
here because the chuul can make 2 claw attacks per turn despite not being
Elite. These do extra damage against immobilized targets.

If both attacks hit the same target, the Chuul will make a attack against the
victim's Fortitude using its face tentacles. This does no damage, but
immobilizes on a hit. The tentacles also figure in the Tentacle Net ability, a
passive which automatically immobilizes anyone hit by the chuul's opportunity
attacks.

The chuul's ambush predator tactics make it seem like a lurker, but I guess it
doesn't try to hide again after first emerging, though it prefers to stick to
the water.

Next we have the **Chuul Juggernaut**, a Level 23 Elite Soldier. It's Huge, has
ground and swim speeds of 7 and also psychic powers! Psychic Lure is a ranged 10
attack against Will that does psychic damage and pulls the target 5 squares on a
hit. The Juggernaut otherwise fights like the classic model, but is much less
shy about leaving the water. We're back to having to fix its damage: as an elite
it's supposed to make two full-damage attacks and not two half-damage ones.


## Encounters

The first is level 10, 2 chuuls, a feymire crocodile, and a bog hag. Just to
show you these things also live on the surface and associate with people that
are not mind flayers.

The second is level 23, a chuul juggernaut and three blood fiends. I got nothing
on this one.

## Final Impressions

I don't dislike these, but they don't exactly spark joy, y'know?
