Back in the early years of this blog I spent a large amount of time writing up
fantasy monsters for GURPS as part of my [Dragon's Dogma adaptation][2]. Then I
spent a long time reviewing D&D fantasy monsters by reading through most of the
significant monster books for the 4th edition of that game.

I figured it's about time I gave some love to other genres. There's more to life
than dungeon fantasy, after all. There's also Action!

Mooks of the Multiverse is going to be a series of indeterminate size where each
post looks at the enemies from a modern or science fiction setting and tries to
stat them and (more importantly) their gear for GURPS. In this initial post,
we'll establish some ground rules.

## Action-style Mooks

The basic definition of a mook we'll be using is the one from [this post][1] I
wrote way back in 2017, which is also the one from GURPS Action. Mooks or
minions are nameless opponents who tend to show up in large numbers to fight our
heroic PCs. Their numbers, more than their stats, are what make them a genuine
threat. A small band of minions will mainly serve to make the PCs look good, but
a large mob is a danger that needs to be managed. "Small" and "large" are
relative - the more mult-target attacks the PCs have, the more minions they can
handle safely.

Minions only fight using the most basic maneuvers to both attack and protect
themselves. They can make active defense rolls, but a single solid hit will take
them out of the fight. Whether that means they're dead, injured, or even running
away depends on the specific context, but they're out.

In the original article I interpret "a solid hit" to mean any hit that does at
least 1 point of injury after armor. Depending on the setting we're talking
about, we might need to be a bit more flexible than that. The following rules
will come up very often:

### Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy

Also known as "Mook Marksmanship" in Action. When this rule is in effect,
minions armed with guns (or beam weapons!) always miss with their first attack
in the fight. Subsequent attacks are rolled normally.

The main difference here is that this isn't paired with the Gun Control Law rule
that prevents minions from shooting at gun-less PCs and makes them easy to
disarm. The sort of minion we'll look at usually has no trouble in these areas,
but their aim still sucks even when the PCs _are_ armed.

### Imperial Stormtrooper Armor Training


This is a new one! When this rule is in effect, the mook counts as having DR 0
no matter what kind of armor they might be wearing. Any other benefits the armor
confers, like built-in communicators or environmental protection, still apply
normally.

This is mainly relevant for science fiction settings, which often feature mooks
in cool sci-fi armor. The examples of this kind of gear in Ultra-Tech and
related sources are pretty awesome for PCs, but then end up making minions
unreasonably tough because getting even 1 point of damage past their DR might
not be guaranteed.

The traditional solution to this problem usually involves inventing an
especially crappy tier of armor that only mooks wear, but I think that's too
much work. If you want your Ewoks to be able to poke your stormtroopers to death
with pointy sticks, just implement this rule instead. As a bonus, it lets the
PCs wear the minion's armor and be well-protected.

This also works well in modern settings where the PCs might frequently face
mooks wearing state-of-the-art tactical gear. GMs who want to make things just a
little more challenging might also assign a DR value higher than 0, but lower
than the armor's real value.
