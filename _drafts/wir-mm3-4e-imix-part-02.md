In this post we'll take a look at the kind of people who make up Imix's cult in
the middle world. As mentioned in [Part 1][2], the cult promises to give its
adherents the power to burn all that angers them, so it draws in all sorts of
misanthropes, murderers, and people with all-consuming grudges. Rising through
the cult's ranks means allowing your free will to be burned out piece by
piece. No matter your reasons for joining, soon all you'll care about is serving
your primordial master.

Cultists of Imix can act covertly, infiltrating peaceful communities to sow
sedition and discord. They can also act more openly, establishing strongholds
and calling out to both recruits and mercenaries to help conquer the surrounding
regions, immolating anyone who opposes them.

The cultist lineup here is pretty diverse, species-wise, for the Fire Lord isn't
picky like those posers Yeenoghu and Baphomet. He'll find a use for anyone
willing to swear the oaths, even if that use is "walking bomb". These stat
blocks should be mixed with more "generic" stat blocks for humans and other
humanoid or elemental opposition to build Imix-themed encounter groups. They're
not enough to do so on their own.

## Fire Lord Cultist

This Level 5 Minion Brute represents the bulk of the cult's low-ranking
followers. They have a speed of 6 and fight with torches and **clubs**. Their
melee attacks deal extra damage if they're adjacent to an ally, so they have an
incentive to cluster around a PC.

They can also use that torch in the **Ignite** ability. This encounter power is
a melee attack that targets Reflex and deals ongoing 5 fire damage (save
ends). Make sure this is their first attack, because they might not get a chance
to use it otherwise.

## Servant of the Fire Lord

A more senior and better-trained cultist. Servants of the Fire Lord tend to hide
out in sapient communities disguised as clerics of more benign deities. They use
this cover to undermine the community and spread Imix's influence over it.

The Servant stat block depicts a half-elf. It's a Level 6 Skirmisher with the
Leader tag and 73 HP. Their ground speed is 6 and they have low-light vision.

Servants try to always keep moving in order to benefit from their **Wildfire
Stride** passive trait: if they move at least 3 squares, their attacks deal +5
fire damage for a turn.

They wield **scimitars** that can perform a standard basic attack and an
**Immolating Strike**, which is a bit weaker but deals ongoing 5 fire damage
(save ends). The basic strike itself is also kinda weak - it's the Wildfire
Stride damage bonus that brings it to the expected level of damage.

Their "leaderly" skill is the **Gift of Fire** (recharge 5+), a minor action
that gives every ally within 5 squares a +5 fire damage bonus that lasts for a
turn.

## Fire Temple Elect

The name sounds important, but that's a lie. Fire Temple Elects are cultists who
had all of their will burned away but didn't have the potential to master Imix's
mysteries. They proudly serve their master as walking bombs.

Elects are Level 7 Minion Skirmishers with an excellent ground speed of 7. They
employ human wave tactics, charging enemies with their **shortwswords**. When an
elect drops to 0 HP, they trigger the **Self-Immolation** ability. When this
happens the elect can move its speed as a free action, and then explode. This is
a Close Burst 1 attack that targets Reflex and deals a bit of fire damage. It's
not selective, so if you have a bunch of elects close together the first one to
get hit might trigger a chain reaction.

## Fire Temple Champion

This one's actually important. Champions also have little of their free will
left, but unlike the Elects they were tough enough to handle a more substantial
blessing. They're tasked with protecting key locations and important
individuals. I can also see them leading mercenary squads in operations
important to the cult.

The stat block in the book is for a dragonborn Champion, a Level 8 Soldier with
88 HP. She wears plate and wields a Fullblade (a big two-handed sword).

The Champion has the same **Wildfire Stride** ability seen in the Servant of the
Fire Lord, above. Her **fullblade** attacks mark for a turn, and do damage
that's only a couple of points below the expected average - Wildfire Stride
makes them stronger than that average. If a marked enemy within reach moves on
their turn, the Champion can use a **Fiery Attack** against them, dealing the
same damage as a basic attack and inflicting ongoing 5 fire damage (save ends).

If that marked enemy instead makes an attack that doesn't include the champion
as a target, she can use a **Fiery Rebuke**, a Close Blast 3 attack that targets
only the triggering enemy, attacks Reflex and deals fire damage.

And as a dragonborn, this particular champion also has one use of **Dragon
Breath** per encounter. It works like the power for Dragonborn PCs, a Close
Blast 3 that targets Reflex. It obviously deals fire damage, and marks those it
hits.

## Flameborn

Flameborn are priests who have attained sufficient rank to run a small
temple/stronghold, with the goal of making it grow larger and more
important. They're ultimately in charge of those recruitment drives and raiding
campaigns I mentioned earlier. In other words they're accomplished middle
managers.

The stat block we get is a human priest, who is Level 15 Artillery with 111 HP
and the Leader keyword. They have Speed 6 and Resist 10 Fire, the first Imix
cultists actually resistant to their thematic element. They project an aura (5)
named **Fire Within**, which grants Resist 5 Fire to all allies inside.

Flameborn with with **flails** in melee and with **fire bolts** at range. The
bolts also inflict ongoing fire damage. Once per encounter they can call down
the **Blessing of Imix**, which covers a Close Burst 3. It acts as an attack
dealing fire damage to enemies, and grands allies 10 temporary HP.

Their final power is a minor action, **Fiery Eye**, which can target targets
taking ongoing fire damage. It's a rangged attack against Will that does no
damage, slides the target 2 squares, and makes them grant combat advantage (save
ends).

Flameborn pair well with skirmishers that possess sneak-attack-like
abilities. They can also grant fire resistance to their front-line without
having to stand right behind it.

## Conflagration Orb

This is not a cultist, but rather something they might summon with high-level
rituals. Conflagration Orbs are avatars of Imix, and look like miniature suns.
They contain a fragment of Imix's power and are loyal only to him. They'll work
alongside the cultists that summon them, because the cult's goals usually
coincide with the primordial's, but they are totally unconcerned with the safety
of the cultists and will happily include them in their area attacks if it means
hitting the PCs as well.

It's interesting that the book uses the word avatar here. It appears to be a
primordial-specific term, since the equivalent entity for a god or demon lord is
called an "Aspect". Then again it could also be just an editorial oversight.

Anyway, Conflagration Orbs are Level 20 Artillery with 143 HP. They can roll
around at speed 6, but prefer to use their flight speed of 8 (hover)
instead. They're immune to disease and have Resist 20 Fire. Its basic melee
attack is named **Rolling Frame**, and consists of bumping into people. The
attack allows the orb to shift 1 square as an effect, targets Reflex, and deals
immediate and ongoing fire damage. Its ranged **Scorching Bolts** have much the
same effects but are stronger, and the orb can fire two of them against
different targets in a single action.

The orb complements this with occasional **Fire Tempests** (recharge 5+) which
allow them to make three area attacks that deal fire damage and increase any
ongoing fire damage the targets are suffering by 5. The three areas can't have
any squares in common.

If the orb is surrounded it can release **Waves of Flame** to get some
space. This deals fire damage in a Close Burst 3, and pushes any targets it hits
3 squares. It also creates a zone that lasts for a turn, partially obscures the
orb, and deals 10 fire damage to enemies caught inside.

Scorching Bolt and Fire Tempest are very strong powers, because they're
multi-attacks that each do the full expected damage amount for a monster of this
level. The orb can't target the same enemy multiple times, but it's still very
good at spreading the hurt around.

## Chosen of Imix

The Chosen are the highest ranking priests in the cult. Each of them is in
charge of a major temple and commands a sizable force of mortal followers,
mercenaries, and elemental servants. They commune directly with Imix and
transmit his orders to the other members of the court.

Chosen rarely leave their temple's inner sanctum, as this is where their power
is greatest. The book recommends making these sanctums into Fonts of Power, a
special terrain type described in the DMG that enhances the damage of attacks
that have a matching elemental keyword (fire, in this case). Since the Chosen is
an epic tier enemy, they'll be fighting in terrain that gives their fire attacks
a whopping +15 bonus damage! PCs planning to attack a temple of Imix would do
well to figure out a way to engage the Chosen outsid this sanctum.

Chosen are Level 22 Controllers with the Leader keyword. They have a stronger
version of the Flameborn's Fire Within aura, granting 10 fire resistance to all
allies within 5 squares. Their basic melee attack is a **dagger** that damages
targets and makes them vulnerable 10 to fire for a turn. Pretty much ever other
attack they know  has the Fire keyword, so they're going to benefit from this
vulnerability _and_ from that Font of Power bonus damage.

Their basic ranged attack is a **Fire Orb** that deals fire damage to the
target, and 5 damage to each enemy adjacent to the target. Before they resort to
that, though, they'll fill the map with **Servants of Elemental Fire**. This
power is a standard action that summons a "fire grue" to a space within 10
squares of the Chosen. Fire grues are minions with the same defenses as the
Chosen. They can't make attacks, but each enemy that starts their turn adjacent
to one or more grues takes 10 fire damage (subject to those situational bonuses
I mentioned earlier). The Chosen can spend a minor action to move all grues on
the map up to 6 squares. They can have up to four grues summoned, or six when
they're bloodied.

Once per encounter they can use **Fire's Fury** to detonate a fire grue,
attacking a Close Burst 1 around it. The explosion deals fire damage and dazes
(save ends) on a hit.
