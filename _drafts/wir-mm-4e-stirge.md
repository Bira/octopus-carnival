Stirges have been in the game at least since the days of Basic. Here, they are
both in the Monster Manual and in the Vault.

## The Lore

Stirges are another example of dangerous fantasy wildlife in the implied Fourth
Edition setting. Looking like a cross between a large bat and a mosquito, these
things feed on blood and will attack any nearby creature in search of it when
hungry. While a mosquito can be dangerous because it transmit diseases, a stirge
is large enough for the blood loss it causes to be worrying. A flock of them
could exsanguinate an adult human in minutes.

Like bats, they nest in dark places and tend to hunt at night. They're a common
enough threat that anti-stirge measures are a part of every culture. Ship crews,
for example, spread unpleasant-smelling unguents in their cargo holds to prevent
stirges from nesting there. Sheperds and ranchers absolutely hate them and have
their own set of measures.

Any dark dungeon might be home to a flock of stirges, making them one of the
many dangers adventurers must be wary of. A large enough flock can threaten even
seasoned veterans!

Since they're considered vermin by the people of the world, they also have all
the same sinister associations worms and rats and such get. Particularly gross
necromancers love filling the body cavities of a large, bloated zombie with a
flock of stirges, which burst out when their carrier is slain. Optionally the
stirges might be zombies as well.

## The Numbers

Stirges are Small Natural Beasts, which does mean they might get as big as three
feet across (halfling-sized!). They have darkvision, a flight speed of 6 with
Hover, and a pathetic ground speed of 2. Their main attack is always a "bite"
with their blood-sucking proboscis-beak thing, but the exact mechanics of that
vary per stat block.

### Stirge (Both)

The basic model is a Level 1 Lurker with 22 HP and the common traits above. The
**bite** is its only attack. It does damage and grabs the target (escape DC
12). While the target is grabbed, it takes 5 ongoing damage from the
blood-sucking. While the stirge is grabeed, it gains +5 to AC and Reflex.

The MM version has an extremely weak bite even for a level 1 monster (1d4
damage), but the MV updates that to be in line with the new math (1d4+5).

While that's not a big threat to a full party, it's terrifying to a civilian!
Non-combatants are likely minions, and if not they're unlikely to have much more
than 10 or 15 HP. A stirge like the above could be nesting in any given dark
hole near the poor schmuck's farm, and could kill them in one bite and _maybe_ a
round or two of blood-sucking. It's likely to be a much more common threat than
a goblin raid or the like.

### Stirge Suckerling (MV)

A young stirge that's already quite hungry. It's a Level 5 Minion Lurker, which
means it comes in hordes.

Their only attack is the usual **bite**, which does a bit of damage and
initiates a grab (escape DC 15). While the grab persists, the suckerling can
only make bite attacks against the grabbed target, but those hit
automatically. The target also takes ongoing damage equal to the number of
suckerlings attached to it, so be sure to make them gang up on the
squishies. Now there's a nice mental image for you.
