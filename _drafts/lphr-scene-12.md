# [GM] Intro

This is our third strategic turn for Hell's Rebels Adventure 01. In the last
turn, the PCs:

- Increased their "management" skills to do a better job as officers.
- Recruited a team of Sneaks.
- Got their number of supporters up to 25.
- Got a critical failure when trying to gather information, increasing their
  Notoriety by 4.
- Handled an unhealthy rivalry between their new Sneak team and the Crow
  Sisters.

In the "tactical" phase, they resolved both the Crackdown at Clenchjaw's and An
Unsanctioned Excruciation events. This gave them 2 character poins total, plus
Vendalfek as a special ally. It also increased Notoriety by a further 2 points.

I also realize I've been very lax about properly leveling up my rebellion, so
let's do that here as well.

# [GM] Mythic Bookkeeping

Let's keep the Chaos Factor at 6. I didn't use the random tables at all, but
things haven't really gotten any less dangerous.

Our threads remain the same.

It said "Rank 1" before, but we were actually rank 2, so I fixed that here. I
also added the +2 to Notoriety from the tactical missions, and Vendalfek as an
ally.

## Upkeep Phase

At the start of this phase, Rexus reduces our Notoriety by 1 to 5.

Step 1, Supporter Attrition - Unmodified **Loyalty** check. Rosalia will attempt
all of her three complimentary skills here. She succeeds at all three, and the
final roll succeeds by 2. We lose only 1d6 -> 4 supporters.

Step 2 - Notoriety Maximum: We're just a 5, nothing to do here.

Step 3 - Treasury Shortage: We remain fine.

Step 4 - Increase Rank: We're still above the minimum for rank 4, so we rank up
twice!

That means all of our three traits increase by +1. Our maximum teams increase by
+1. Our minimum treasury increases to $200 (pfft, easy). Our PCs each get two
boons from ranks 3 and 4: a potion worth $1500 or less, and the title of
Guardian.

Looking back at the quick and dirty rules I established on Scene 09, I don't
have rules for titles yet. In the original, those would come with bonus feats
that seem to be of the "math tax" variety. Skill bonuses at rank 4, save bonuses
at 9, and stuff like increased speed, initiative or HP at 14, and any feat they
qualify for at 19.

Let's instead give them a +1 Reputation with all who oppose Thrune at each of
these levels, ending up at +4 at Rank 19. Let's say it applies all the time to
everyone except a large class (Thrune Supporters). That's a x2/3 modifier, so
let's make it worth 3 points/level. The PCs don't need to pay for it but it does
increase their point value.

I've ammended the quick and dirty rules on scene 09 to account for this.

## Activity Phase

We're still at two actions here, with a bonus action for having a Strategist.

We can have another team, so I think it's a good idea to **recruit** one. Let's
go with a team of Street Performers. This is an unpenalized Secrecy roll with a
+2 from Laria and a +1 from Jania (2 successes, 1 failure). It's a success, so
we have a team.

Next I think we'll spend our second action to **upgrade** our brand new Street
Performers to Rumormongers, since the'll benefit from our little fairy dragon's
help. That costs $250 from our treasury and requires no rolls.

And finally we will again use our bonus action to **Recruit Supporters**,
because we still have room to grow. Unmodified Loyalty, plus +2 from Laria, +1
from Rexus' Administration. A normal success and a somewhat poor effect roll
gives us 7 new supporters. We'll still be in rank 4 next turn.

## Event Phase

Base chance for an event is the city's Danger (20) + our Notoriery (5), without
doubling since we did have an event last turn. We roll a 96, so nothing bad
happens!
