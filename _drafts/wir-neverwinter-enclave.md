Neverwinter is a coastal city-state built at the mouth of a river. There are
several stories about how it got that name, but the most popular one is that it
was from the warm waters of that river, which prevent the delta from freezing
during winter and so keep its port viable year-round.

A lot of present-day Neverwinter's national identity is based on the fabled
reign of Nasher Alagondar, a former adventure who became the city's ruler around
150 years ago. While some of the details were lost to time and to the
Spellplague, he was said to be a devout follower of Tyr, who was god of justice
in those days. Nasher never named himself king, though his descendants would
eventually accept the title and continue to rule the city well. Their line was
ostensibly unbroken until the cataclysm 27 years ago, when the last of them died
or vanished.

(Lord Nasher is the city's ruler during both Neverwinter Nights games, where
he's depicted as a very pragmatic True Neutral ruler, so the view above is
somewhat romanticized.)

The cataclysm wrecked the city, opening a huge chasm that destroyed its
southeastern quadrant. Most of the citizens who didn't die left as refugees, and
only a minority of holdouts decided to stay and protect their ancestral
homes. They built a makeshift wall to isolate the Chasm and its monsters from
the rest of the city, and soon began to see its defense as a sacred duty.

Lord Neverember arrived nearly ten years ago at the head of an army of
carpenters and builders, protected by a mercenary force from Mintarn. Around
five years ago he established the Protector's Enclave, a sort of "green zone"
taking up the southwestern quadrant of the city, which he declared safe for
occupation.
