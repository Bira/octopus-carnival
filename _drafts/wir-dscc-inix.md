## The Lore

Unlike most of the Athasian fauna we saw so far, these giant lizards are fairly
docile omnivores. They mostly eat plants and roots, though they'll also feed on
carrion and small animals. They only attack people if directly
threatened.

Inixes are widely domesticated for use as mounts, draft animals, and
livestock. Some people like to keep juveniles as pets. In the wild, they roam in
small bands. Inix females lay eggs once a year, and are capable of producing
viable eggs even without a male.


## The Numbers

Inixes are Natural Beasts, with the Reptile tag. When forced to fight they
attack with bites and with swipes of their large and powerful tails.

### Inix Juvenile

Inix juveniles are only about half the size of adults, which means they're
Medium. This slighter build makes them faster than adults. Juveniles also have
venom in their bites, which they lose as they grow up. They're Level 4
Skirmishers with 57 HP and a speed of 8.

As mentioned above, their **bite** is venomous, dealing a mix of physical and
poison damage. As a minor action they can attempt a **Tail Trip**, which attacks
Fortitude. On a hit, the inix knocks the target prone and can shift 1 square.

### Inix Adult

Adults are size Large, and Level 9 Brutes with 120 HP and a Speed of 6. They'll
probably open the fight with a **Tail Slap** that attacks the Fortitude of
enemies in a Close Blast 2. On a hit it deals standard physical damage and
knocks the targets prone.

Next, it's time for the **bite**, which deals standard physical damage. When it
hits a prone target, the bite deals extra damage and grabs that target. The
victim can only try to stand up after the grab ends, and the inix can keep
making bite attacks against it (but not against others while the victim remains
grabbed).

If the inix is serving as a mount, it can use the **Warding Tail** ability. This
triggers when the rider is hit by an opportunity attack provoked by making a
ranged or area attack, and lets the inix use Tail Slap against the triggering
creature as a free action. This makes them a fine mount for artillery monsters!

## Encounters and Final Impressions

A short and sweet entry. It's always good to see another member of the club of
Athasian creatures that are not suicidally aggressive predators.

Encounters with domesticated inixes tend to be much more interesting than those
with wild ones, as they can feature more varied encounter groups. As mentioned
above, adults are awesome mounts for artillery and controller riders. They're
also fun to have as the draft animal for a "runaway wagon" scenario, as they
tend to be much harder to physically stop than horses.
