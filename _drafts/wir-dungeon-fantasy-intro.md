As I begin writing this, I have just finished writing all the posts for my
"Let's Read" of the Neverwinter Campaign Setting, the final D&D book I intend to
cover for a while. After thinking about it for a bit, I've decided to do one for
the Dungeon Fantasy RPG!

This is going both here in the blog and on the RPG.net forums, as usual, and one
of the reasons I'm doing it is because I feel lots of people over at RPG.net
would benefit from knowing more about this game.

## What is Dungeon Fantasy?

"Dungeon Fantasy" is the name Steve Jackson Games invented for the genre of
fantasy pioneered by D&D: fantasy stories that are about a bunch of player
characters going into dungeons, killing monsters, and looting treasure. Most of
the works that fall within this genre are games, either tabletop or
electronic. D&D is the most famous but by no means the only one. Most of the
fiction entries in the genre are based on games as well, with Amazon's Vox
Machina being a particularly famous entry based on an actual tabletop campaign.

And sure, you can use these games to tell varied stories of intrigue, drama, and
wonder, but their core gameplay loop remains dungeons, monsters, treasure. If
you are using your dungeon fantasy game in its intended manner at all, these
things will feature in your campaign at some point.

## What is the Dungeon Fantasy RPG?

The Dungeon Fantasy RPG is part of Steve Jackson Games' "Powered By GURPS"
initiative, and was released in 2017 after a successful Kickstarter
campaign.

Like the other entries in that project, it's a full standalone game using the
rules of GURPS Fourth Edition as a base. I can confidently say it's the
_chunkiest_ Powered By GURPS game, because all the others were single-book
affairs, and this one is a large boxed set using the full rules. It removes
everything not immediately relevant to the dungeon fantasy genre, but there's
still plenty of fun stuff left. It's about as crunchy as either edition of
Pathfinder, if you want a d20-based benchmark.

Part of the reason for this wealth of material is that the DFRPG is a second
edition of sorts. Much of it had been released as a line of supplements for
GURPS, named "GURPS Dungeon Fantasy". There's about 21 of them, and it's
possible we might get more. The boxed set takes a good chunk of that material,
revises it, and packages it the GURPS core rules you need. The two lines remain
mostly compatible, but there are some important differences between them.

If you're interested in buying the game, and are wondering which version to get,
my recommendation in most cases is to get the DFRPG boxed set. The digital
version is slightly cheaper than a single D&D core book. The physical box is
about double that, which still makes it half the price of a D&D core set.

If you already have both GURPS core books and GURPS Magic, the first two PDFs in
the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy line will be a slightly cheaper entryway. You'll be
missing nonhuman templates, and your bestiary will be smaller, but you'll still
have what you need to play.

If you already have lots of GURPS Dungeon Fantasy books, then you obviously
don't need the boxed set, though this Let's Read might give you an idea of the
differences between both.

And of course, if you start with the boxed set, you can also use PDFs from the
GURPS Dungeon Fantasy line with a bit of adaptation work.

## How will we do this?

The boxed set contains five books:

- **Adventurers**, which is your Player's Handbook with nearly everything you
  need to make a character.

- **Spells** contains the magic system and all the spells used in the game. You
  need this if you're playing a caster.

- **Exploits**, which is your Game Master's Guide with everything you need to
  run the game.

- **Monsters**, which is your Monster Manual. We'll certainly be in familiar
  territory when we get here!

- **I Smell A Rat** is an introductory adventure for starting delvers, with some
  twists since "starting delvers" means something quite different here than it
  does in D&D.

My reading here will assume you know what RPGs are, but know nothing about GURPS
or these books, but will necessarily be less detailed than those for the D&D
Monster Manuals since there's so much stuff to cover. Still, I hope it serves to
give you a good idea of what this game is all about.
