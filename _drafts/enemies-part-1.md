title: "Dragon's Dogma: Enemies Overview"
category: gurps
---

By now we have a pretty complete picture of what the PCs in a GURPS Dragon's
Dogma look like. They can use almost any default **Dungeon Fantasy** template,
or choose to be [Magic Archers][1] and [Mystic Knights][2]. They can be normal
humans, or [Pawns and Arisen][3]. They can equip themselves with
a [variety of gear][4] and they can use a unique form of alchemy to make that
gear [more powerful][5]. And we know they'll spend quite a bit of time fighting
a variety of enemies and relieving them of their treasure. But exactly who are
these enemies? This is what we'll examine in the next few articles!

The original game has a huge variety of interesting monsters to fight, and this
is something I feel a GURPS adaptation should strive to match. There's several
ways you could divide them along thematic categories: by size (small,
human-sized, giant), by origin (mundane, D&D-style fantasy, Greek myth,
original), and so on. For our purposes, though, we'll go with the following:

- _Humanoid_ opponents include actual humans and members of similarly
  shaped. They fight much like the PCs themselves do.

- _Beasts_ are usually non-humanoid in shape and possess a large array of
  natural weaponry. Most are not intelligent, but may still be quite
  cunning. They can also be quite large, but not as large as members of our next
  category, which is...

- _Giant Monsters_! They're _much_ bigger than a typical PC, and have power to
  match their size. While you can usually _grapple_ with an enemy from the
  previous categories, you have to _climb_ a giant monster. One type of giant
  monster that deserves special mention is the _dragon_, which has a few special
  setting considerations assigned to it (the titular Dogma chief among them).

These are just for organizational purposes - a monster from the Dragon's Dogma
setting will still follow normal DF conventions and belong to one of the monster
types defined there.

Over the next four articles, I'll discuss each of these thematic categories in
turn, and provide worked examples for each of them. The fourth article will deal
with dragons, and delve into some of the setting secrets related to them.
