Rosalia Savory used to work at the Kintargo Opera House in a role that, in
modern times, might have been called "production assistant". She did what needed
doing backstage, helped the actors out, sang in the background chorus from
offstage, and so on. It was a living, and she liked doing it.

She was also secretly one of Kintargo's several "mysterious satirists" who
published stuff criticizing the more Thrune-loving segments of the city's
nobility and government, as well as the church of Asmodeus. In her case it was
little absurdist play scripts, which she signed as "Little Lamp".

So when Barzilai Thrune waltzed in, disappeared a lot of people, burned down
their homes, and then took over the Opera House as his personal residence, she
suddenly had a lot of inspiration for new material, and a lot more time in
which to write it since she was out of a job. Her scripts got a lot more
accusative, without losing their comedic edge, and there's a warrant out for her
arrest as soon as someone finds out who she is.

Her future plans include going from production assistant to community
organizer. She's at the protest at the start of adventure 1 because of course
she'd be.

## Description

Rosalia has pale freckled skin, brown eyes, and unruly curly brown hair down to
her shoulders. She usually wears "working stiff" clothes when out and about, and
likes to carry and play a guitar when she's not on the job. She has a fairly
easy-going and fun-loving personality and a tendency to make jokes and maintain
forced cheer to cope with stressful and sad situations, so it feels like she
never stops smiling these days.

Her looks and general demeanor are inspired by Pinkie Pie. I've used her in a
couple of games before, so there's a "yes, her again" note next to her name in
the character sheet.

## Build Notes

Rosalia is mostly a standard DF Bard with the usual wide distribution of
points. She has a couple of bard powers, a small set of mind-affecting spells,
and a little fencing ability. The biggest deviation here is that she's naturally
talented at shooting pistols, which is kinda funny because she doesn't start in
possession of a gun. Getting her one, and the corresponding ammo, should be a
priority once play starts.

In a fight she's mostly going to rely on Song of Humiliation to aid her physical
attacks, and cast spells if she has the time and space to do so.

Dungeon Fantasy being the way it is, by virtue of being a Bard Rosalia starts
with by far the most social skills in the group, and only loses out on reaction
bonuses to Jade, so she's going to be one of the party's "faces".
