Remember when I told you the MM3 had the very good idea of giving each devil and
demon its own entry rather than lumping them all together? Here's where they
kinda toss that out the window and make a big entry full of diverse stat blocks
for a single type of devil.

Corruption Devils, or Paeliryons, first appeared in one of the later Monster
Manuals for 3rd Edition. I remember they were not very well-received because
their lore and appearance had some quite unfortunate implications. Let's see if
that improved in any way.

## The Lore

The book describes these devils as "bloated infernal masterminds of graft,
sleaze, and vice". They're better at politics and intrigue than almost anyone
else in Hell, and they put that skill to use in subverting mortal societies to
their benefit. They do this through extensive networks of agents and dupes. Most
paeliryons work for Dispater, lord of the second layer of Hell, acting as the
civil administration of that wretched city.

A corruption devil's agent network is somewhat inverted from what you'd
expect. Its most powerful members are kept at a safe remove from the devil,
while those that work directly with it are ignorant sycophants and expendable
muscle. Though physically imposing, the creatures prefer to avoid direct
conflicts, and will try to negotiate their way out of trouble.
