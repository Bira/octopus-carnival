I've already discussed chokers as they appeared in the Monster Manual [here][],
but it turns out they to get a Monster Vault-style update in Dungeon
Magazine. Since it appears those articles are considered "missing pages from the
Monster Vault", I'll cover them here as well.

The article in question is "Monster Manual Update: Choker", from Dungeon
#196. It contains updated versions of the Cavern and Feygrove Chokers found in
the MM, which are welcome but don't contain any surprises. The biggest addition
here is in the lore, which pretty much dashes my hopes in the earlier post about
some chokers being nice.






## The Numbers

The Cavern Choker remains a level 4 lurker with 42 HP. The main change from the
MM is a significant upgrade to its Chameleon Skin, which now gives _full_
concealment and is always on as long as the choker doesn't have anyone
grabbed.

The Choke attack is gone - now the Tentacle Claw does 10 ongoing damage to
grabbed targets until they escape. Escape attempts now have an explicit DC of
21, which is about the same as you'd get under the old rules. Body Shield has
had its text changed and clarified. It's still an interrupt that redirects an
attack by someone else to the grabbed victim, but now it only recharges when the
choker hits with Tentacle Claw. This means that the monster can only use it
_once_ after it grabs a target, making "grab, release on your next turn, grab
again" preferable to holding on until the target dies.

The exact same set of changes also applies to the Feygrove Choker, which remains
a Level 12 Lurker with 91 HP. It can still grab two people instead of just one,
so it has more opportunities to use Body Shield. The damage fixes also have much
more of an impact on it, since it's a higher-level monster.

## Final Impressions



No new example encounters, though the lore implies the typical choker encounter
would happen as the party is attacked by non-sapient predators in a cave/fey
forest and the choker arrives as an opportunist in the middle of the fight.
