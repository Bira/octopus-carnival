I've already discussed chokers as they appeared in the Monster Manual [here][],
but it turns out they to get a Monster Vault-style update in Dungeon
Magazine. Since it appears those articles are considered "missing pages from the
Monster Vault", I'll cover them here as well.

The article in question is "Monster Manual Update: Choker", from Dungeon
#196. It contains updated versions of the Cavern and Feygrove Chokers found in
the MM, which are welcome but don't contain any surprises. The biggest addition
here is in the lore, which pretty much dashes my hopes in the earlier post about
some chokers being nice.

They're still Unaligned, but their unpleasantness is further emphasized
here. Chokers love the Underdark but may be found in other favorable
environments closer to the surface, particularly near sapient settlements. You
see, they prefer hunting sapient prey, because in addition to being good eatin'
they often carry the shiny baubles and jewels which these creatures love to
collect and occasionally fondle.

Chokers typically live and hunt alone, because they're so antisocial they see
even other chokers as prey. They gots shinies and meat on them just like anybody
else, precious. These creatures are however just smart enough to accept shiny
bribes in exchange for not eating someone, and sometimes drow or other
underground dwellers can hire them on that basis. Drow in particular don't like
to do it very often, because they find chokers too unpredictable.

All of this applies equally to the mid-Heroic Cave Choker and the early-Paragon
Feygrove Choker, with the difference being the feygrove choker hangs around
Eladrin cities on the surface and fomorian settlements in the Feydark.

## The Numbers

The Cavern Choker remains a level 4 lurker with 42 HP. The main change from the
MM is a significant upgrade to its Chameleon Skin, which now gives _full_
concealment and is always on as long as the choker doesn't have anyone
grabbed.

The Choke attack is gone - now the Tentacle Claw does 10 ongoing damage to
grabbed targets until they escape. Escape attempts now have an explicit DC of
21, which is about the same as you'd get under the old rules. Body Shield has
had its text changed and clarified. It's still an interrupt that redirects an
attack by someone else to the grabbed victim, but now it only recharges when the
choker hits with Tentacle Claw. This means that the monster can only use it
_once_ after it grabs a target, making "grab, release on your next turn, grab
again" preferable to holding on until the target dies.

The exact same set of changes also applies to the Feygrove Choker, which remains
a Level 12 Lurker with 91 HP. It can still grab two people instead of just one,
so it has more opportunities to use Body Shield. The damage fixes also have much
more of an impact on it, since it's a higher-level monster.

## Final Impressions

I like the additional lore, though it definitiely makes it clear that chokers
are more _monsters_ than _people_. The stat updates are welcome too. I'd
normally just apply a damage fix to the MM stat blocks and call it a day, but
these come with some interesting changes like the boost to Chameleon Skin.

No new example encounters, though the lore implies the typical choker encounter
would happen as the party is attacked by non-sapient predators in a cave/fey
forest and the choker arrives as an opportunist in the middle of the fight.
