In [Part 2][1] of this series, we took a look at the guns that appear on
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, whose timeline I named "Wolfenstein-2" for ease of
reference. The timeline from the 2001 game, whose guns I talked about [here][2],
was Wolfenstein-1.

### Plot Overview (Contains Spoilers)

Though this game was launched a year earlier, its story starts off right after
The Old Blood ends. After B. J. Blaskowicz returns to the Allies with the
location of General Deathshead's secret hideout, they mount a massive attack on
that island fortress.

The attack is a disaster, because the compound is defended by weird dieselpunk
jet fighters and robots of all sizes, as well as the usual complement of human
soldiers. Blazko is among the soldiers that make it to the shore, and his unit
makes significant progress into the fortress before they end up falling in a
locked chamber where Deathshead and a bunch of supersoldiers capture them.

After a few very unpleasant scenes, the survivors manage to escape just as the
room they're in explodes. Blazko gets hit in the head by a large piece of
shrapnel. He washes ashore somewhere in Poland, and since no one knows who he
is, gets sent to an asylum. He spends the next 14 years there slowly recovering,
with nearly no motor function, slipping in and out of comas.

A Nazi attack on the asylum in 1960 gives him the impulse he needs to complete
his recovery, and the first actual level of the game is escaping that situation
with Anna, the other survivor of the place. They reach Anna's grandparents,
where Blazko learns that the Nazis won the war in 1948, and that as far as
everyone knows the last members of the resistance had been captured and sent to
an "inescapable" prison in Berlin.

The rest of the game is about freeing these prisoners, rejoining with the
remains of the resistance, and building it back up through a series of daring
heists. It's here that the resistance discovers the last surviving member of a
secret organization named Da'at Yichud. They were engineers that were apparently
building superscience devices as a form of worship centuries before the rest of
the world discovered organized religion. That last survivor, Set Roth, is
Jewish, but I'm not sure if all the other members were necessarily so. The
overall portrayal of the organization is well-meaning but as far as I know still
considered kinda problematic. The reason the Nazis have all this superscience is
that Deathshead stumbled into one of the many vaults they use to keep those
devices away from the public (the worship was in the _building_, not in the
_using_).

Your series of heists culminate with capturing a super-submarine, recovering its
nuclear launch codes from a Nazi base _on the Moon_, and then using it to mount
another attack on Deathshead's fortress.

This time Blazko manages to kill Deathshead, though the asshole manages to
detonate a grenade as he dies. The game ends as B. J., too wounded to evacuate,
gives his allies the all-clear to launch the nuke that will destroy this
fortress for good.

## The Guns

The vast majority of the guns here are, again, captured Nazi hardware. And
those, in turn, are "new and improved" versions of the guns we saw in The Old
Blood.

### Pistols

#### Pistol Model 1960

A direct descendant of the 1946 model, this one has a more futuristic look, a
double-stacked 20-round magazine, and the ability to fire 3-round bursts. It
still takes the same cinematic silencer. As before, it adds -1 to Bulk, makes
the gun cinematically silent, and also makes it only able to fire in semi-auto
mode (RoF 3).

If using standard GURPS skills, you need Guns (Pistol) to fire in semi-auto
mode, and Guns (SMG) to fire in full-auto. If using the optional skills from
Pyramid #3/65, you need Guns (Pistol), with the Burst-Fire technique for
full-auto mode.

| TL | Weapon      | Damage  | Acc | Range    | Weight      | RoF | Shots   | ST | Bulk | Rcl |
|:--:|:-----------:|:-------:|:---:|:--------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-------:|:--:|:----:|:----|
| 8  | Pistol 1960 | 2d+2 pi | 2   | 160/1800 | 1.4kg/0.5kg | 9   | 20+1(3) | 10 | -2   | 2   |


### Long Arms

In the standard system, use the Guns skill that corresponds to their description
(SMG, Shotgun, Rifle).

If you're using the alternate skills from Pyramid #3/65, they all use Guns (Long
Arm), of course. The Burst-Fire technique helps fire weapons at a RoF greater
than 3 without penalty.

#### American Submachine Gun

This is pretty much a historical **Thompson M1A1**, described in p. HT122. The
Allies mostly didn't have access to superscience in this timeline and were
limited to historical equipment.

Allied soldiers are armed with this during the 1946 assault on Deathshead's
compound, and Fergus urges them to grab an enemy gun as soon as possible.

This is the only gun in this section that's fired with Guns (SMG).

#### Assault Rifle Model 1960

An evolution of the 1946 model, it's lighter and uses a double-stacked 45 round
magazine, but still fires the same round. The biggest change here is an
underbarrel mount that can take a mini-rocket launcher, which appears as an
upgrade midway through the game. This is detailed in the Launchers section.

#### Marksman Rifle 1960

This semi-automatic rifle is about the same length as the AR, but fires a
heftier round (likely 7.92x57mm) from a 10-round clip. It has an integral
scope. It's a relatively rare find both in the hands of enemies and as
loot. Clearly the Nazis are bigger fans of the spray-and-pray approach to
marksmanship.

#### Shockhammer Model 1960

Another descendant of the gun from The Old Blood, this one uses a much more
conventional drum magazine and a single barrel to achieve better
performance. It's no less absurd, however, as its drum is apparently divided
into two separate compartments. One of them takes standard shells, the other
takes what the game calls "shrapnel" shells.

These shells fire red-hot cutting fragments that ricochet off walls in a very
video-gamey way, allowing the player to hit enemies behind cover or around
corners by bouncing the shrapnel off the wall behind them. The shotgun can only
fire in semi-auto mode while using these shells.

When both sides of the drum are loaded, switching between then is a matter of
flipping a switch (a Ready action). But you only find shrapnel shells several
levels _after_ you first find the shotgun, which means that Blazko and any
enemies that haven't been issued special ammo are running around with a
half-filled drum.

For the GURPS version below, I'm treating shrapnel as Multi-Flechette shells
(High-Tech p. 174) that are on fire. They do about the same damage per
projectile, but put more projectiles in the air and can ignite flammable
material. GMs who wish to replicate the ricochet effect can reduce the penalty
for firing at targets behind cover when there are suitable surfaces nearby.

| TL | Weapon             | Damage       | Acc | Range    | Weight       | RoF  | Shots   | ST  | Bulk | Rcl |

### Energy Weapons

There are several laser weapons in the game. All of these use Beam Weapons
(Rifle) unless noted otherwise.

Laser weapons in The New Order draw power from internal batteries that can't be
removed without disassembling the weapon. The usual method of reloading them is
via short-range wireless power transfer from one of the highly dangerous
industrial power outlets that seem to be everywhere in Nazi facilities.

The wielder must stay near the outlet (2 meters away at most) during the
process, which causes lightning to arc between the outlet and the weapon's power
receptors. Doing anything with the weapon other than holding it steady will
interrupt the recharge. Each weapon's description will note how long one of
these things takes to recharge a single shot. This has more to do with how much
power the weapon can draw than with how much the outlet can produce!

In some places you can also find portable batteries that can be used to top up a
weapon through a similar process. The GM will say how many shots from a weapon
an individual battery can recharge.

#### Marksman Rifle (Laser)

On the Moonbase level, everyone carries a laser weapon with the same external
appearance as the Marksman Rifle. It lacks a scope, and can fire in full-auto
mode. Its performance seems to be about on par with the assault rifle, though it
is a lot better at dealing with heavily-armored enemies. Industrial outlets
recharge it at 3 shots per second.

Despite being a laser weapon based on the Marksman Rifle, Nazi soldiers don't
usually use Aim maneuvers with it, so they are not more accurate than usual when
wielding it.

#### Marksman Rifle (Combined)

When you return to Earth after the Moonbase level, B.J.'s Marksman Rifle becomes
a combination gadget of sorts, with the scope on a hinged mount. With the mount
closed and the scope in place, it fires bullets as before. With the scope folded
away, it behaves like the Moonbase laser rifle.

This design is probably more of a video game quality of life decision than
anything else, but if you want to include it in your campaigns you can treat it
as a Combination Gadget per the rules on Ultra-Tech p. 16.

Under those rules, Weight becomes 8kg/0.35kg. Switching modes requires a Ready
maneuver, and the weapon uses the Damage, Acc, Range, RoF and Shots of whatever
version is the currently active one. Keep track of both ammo counts separately!

#### Laserkraftwerk ("Laser Device")

This is an experimental laser weapon that B. J. "liberates" from a lab early in
the game. It's about carbine-sized, and fires shots that are more powerful than
those of the lunar laser rifle but drain more of its internal
battery. Industrial outlets recharge it at a rate of 1 shot per second.

The LKW also has an alternate "laser cutter" module that's useful for quietly
severing chains and cutting through chain-link fences and thin metal walls. This
does 2d(2) burn and can run continuously for half an hour on a full battery, if
it matters.

Over the course of the game, the player can find several upgrades for the LKW,
taking it from a single-shot unscoped weapon to one that shoots full-auto
electrified beams, has a scope, and can fire "charged" shots that deal a lot
more damage but drain the whole battery in one go.

The final upgrade is an "even more superscience" portable reactor that recharges
the weapon at a rate of 1 shot per 2 seconds whenever it's not being fired. This
one's from an undiscovered Da'at Yichud vault.

In the Weapon Table below, you get stats both for the baseline version and the
fully-powered one.

#### Laser Machine Gun

Found in fixed mounts or in the hands of cybernetic supersoldiers and giant
robots, this gun can fire a full-auto laser barrage for quite a bit before
running dry. Enemies don't like to aim with it either, improving the players'
chances of survival when facing it. It's heavy and bulky enough to be only a
"sometimes" gun for the player, used when found and quickly discarded when
empty.

Industrial outlets reload it at a rate of 10 shots per second. Fixed mounts also
connect the gun to external power, allowing it to recharge as it using an
industrial outlet while not being fired.

This uses Gunner (Beams) whether mounted or carried.
