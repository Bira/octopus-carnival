In [Part 2][1] of this series, we took a look at the guns that appear on
Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, whose timeline I named "Wolfenstein-2" for ease of
reference. The timeline from the 2001 game, whose guns I talked about [here][2],
was Wolfenstein-1.

## The New Order Plot Overview (Contains Spoilers)

Though this game was launched a year earlier, its story starts off right after
The Old Blood ends, in 1946. After B. J. Blaskowicz returns to the Allies with
the location of General Deathshead's secret hideout, they mount a massive attack
on that island fortress.

The attack is a disaster. Blazko is among the soldiers that make it to the
shore, and his unit makes significant progress into the fortress before they end
up falling in a locked chamber where Deathshead and a bunch of supersoldiers
capture them.

After a few very unpleasant scenes, the survivors manage to escape just as the
room they're in explodes. Blazko gets hit in the head by a large piece of
shrapnel. He washes ashore somewhere in Poland, catatonic, and since no one
knows who he is, gets sent to an asylum. He spends the next 14 years there
slowly recovering, with nearly no motor function, slipping in and out of comas.

A Nazi attack on the asylum in 1960 gives him the impulse he needs to complete
his recovery, and the first actual level of the game is escaping that situation
with a nurse named Anna, the other survivor of the place. They reach Anna's
grandparents, where Blazko learns that the Nazis won the war in 1948, and that
as far as everyone knows the last members of the resistance had been captured
and sent to an "inescapable" prison in Berlin.

The rest of the game is about freeing these prisoners, rebuilding the
resistance, and striking back at Deathshead through a series of daring
heists. These culminate in the capture of a super-submarine, the recovery of its
nuclear launch codes from a Nazi base on the Moon, and finally an attack on
Deathshead's fortress.

During this process, the resistance discovers the origin of all that
supertech. There was this millenia-old secret society of engineers named Da'at
Yichud, who were building superscience devices as a form of worship since before
the rest of the world had adopted organized religion. They stored these in
secret vaults, because the worship was in the building, not the
using. Deathshead happened to stumble onto a minor cache.

B.J. rescues the last survivor of the order, one Seth Roth, from a concentration
camp, and he provides the protagonists with plenty of vital support and a little
bit of super-science as well. Though Seth is Jewish, I'm not sure if all of the
Da'at Yichud also was. Their portrayal is well-meaning, but from what I hear it
didn't land quite right.

Blazko manages to kill Deathshead during the second attack on his fortress,
though the asshole manages to detonate a grenade as he dies. The game ends as
B. J., too wounded to evacuate, gives his allies the all-clear to launch the
nuke that will destroy this fortress for good.

## The New Colossus Plot Overview (Contains Spoilers)

The next game would come out in 2017, and its plot picks up right where the
previous one left off, though the actual visual elements of the story and the
gameplay mechanics feel significantly different.

B.J.'s allies manage to come back for him, and to take him to their super-sub
before nuking the island. He undergoes extensive surgery, and spends the next
five months slipping in and out of consciousness. As in the previous game, he
awakens fully in the middle of a nazi attack.

Frau Engel, who was a secondary antagonist in the previous game, has been
promoted to replace Deathshead. What she lacks in technical skill, she makes up
in petty cruelty. She commands a flying fortress that is currently attacking the
rebel sub. The first level has BJ fighting off this attack while bound to a
wheelchair. He's aided by resistance leader Caroline and her suit of powered
armor, but they end up getting captured and Caroline gets executed before
B. J. manages to wear her armor and escape with the survivors.

After a brief detour to clear a secret deck on the sub of the Nazis that had
been hiding there and sending transmissions to their bosses, the resistance
decides to follow Caroline's original plan and join together with any surviving
American resistance groups to take the US back and use it as a staging ground to
defeat the Nazis in the rest of the world.

Now wearing the powered armor suit, B.J. helps contact and rescue a resistance
group from radioactive New York. Its leader, Grace, ends up filling Caroline's
spot in the group's leadership. He then blows up a Nazi command center built
next to a Da'at Yichud vault under Roswell (yes, there are flying saucers).

As he's leaving, B. J. decides to drive to his childhood home in Mesquite,
Texas, because his mother left a heirloom wedding ring in there and he wants to
propose to Anna (they've been a couple since the last game and she's expecting
twins). His racist and abusive father sells him out to Frau Engel, who arrives
in the flying fortress and captures him.

After a lot of extremely unpleasant scenes, B.J. becomes one of the few heroic
protagonists to survive a beheading, as he's publicly executed and his head is
immediately rescued by a daring rebel plan. Seth joins the head with a spare
supersoldier body (which could be seen in the sub since the start of the game,
as a piece of foreshadowing).

The missions continue after this: rescuing another resistance group from New
Orleans, flying all the way to Venus to recover the password for the flying
fortress' security system, and taking control of it in a spectacular and daring
raid. Killing Frau Engel live on nation-wide TV is just a victory lap after
that.

The speech from the resistance leaders that immediately precedes the end credits
was very topical for 2017, and I never thought I'd see it becoming _more_
topical in 2025, but here we are.

## The Guns

The vast majority of the guns here are, again, captured Nazi hardware. And
those, in turn, are "new and improved" versions of the guns we saw in The Old
Blood.

Their actual mechanics and list of available weapons changes a bit between the
two games in ways that can be better explained by changes in artistic and
gameplay direction than by in-setting developments. The weapons presented here
are based partially on a melding of their two versions, and partially on what
I'd think would be more interesting for a GURPS Action game.

I'm omitting price information as usual. In a Wolfenstein-inspired game, PCs
will be picking these up from the corpses of their enemies. In other games, the
GM can figure out a price based on the prices of similar real-world weapons.

### Pistols

#### Pistol Model 1960

A direct descendant of the 1946 model, this one has a more futuristic look, a
double-stacked 20-round magazine, and the ability to fire 3-round bursts. It
still takes the same cinematic silencer. As before, it adds -1 to Bulk, makes
the gun cinematically silent, and also makes it only able to fire in semi-auto
mode (RoF 3).

If using standard GURPS skills, you need Guns (Pistol) to fire in semi-auto
mode, and Guns (SMG) to fire bursts. If using the optional skills from Pyramid
#3/65, you need Guns (Pistol), with the Burst-Fire technique for full-auto mode.

The _Pistol Model 1961_ is almost identical, but a little heavier: Weight
1.5kg/0.5kg. The extra weight is due to its sturdier receiver and barrel, which
can safely fire "magnum" rounds: Dam 3d pi, Rcl 3. It can also fire the same
standard 9mm rounds as the Model 1960.

| TL | Weapon      | Damage  | Acc | Range    | Weight      | RoF | Shots   | ST | Bulk | Rcl |
|:--:|:-----------:|:-------:|:---:|:--------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-------:|:--:|:----:|:----|
| 8  | Pistol 1960 | 2d+2 pi | 2   | 160/1800 | 1.4kg/0.5kg | 9   | 20+1(3) | 10 | -2   | 2   |


### Long Arms

In the standard system, use the Guns skill that corresponds to their description
(SMG, Shotgun, Rifle).

If you're using the alternate skills from Pyramid #3/65, they all use Guns (Long
Arm), of course. The Burst-Fire technique helps fire weapons at a RoF greater
than 3 without penalty.

#### American Submachine Gun

This is pretty much a historical **Thompson M1A1**, described in p. HT122. The
Allies mostly didn't have access to superscience in this timeline and were
limited to historical equipment.

Allied soldiers are armed with this during the 1946 assault on Deathshead's
compound, and the game expects you to use them for the handful of minutes
between the start of gameplay and the moment when you first grab an enemy
weapon.

#### Machine Pistol Model 1961

Used extensively by enemies in The New Colossus, this SMG fires a low-caliber
round from a 45-round magazine. It has a retractable wire stock and a
distinctive barrel jacket. If fired one-handed with the stock folded: ST 11, Rcl
3.

The _MP-61S_ has an integral cinematic suppressor that works like the pistol's,
but only RoF 8.

Both models can take a 90-round drum: -1 to Bulk, Shots 90+1(3), weight becomes
3.55/0.85kg. Both can also fire API ammo: Dam 3d(2) pi- inc.

#### Assault Rifle Model 1960

An evolution of the 1946 model, it's lighter and uses a double-stacked 45 round
magazine, but still fires the same round. The biggest change here is an
underbarrel accessory rail that can take a mini-rocket launcher, which appears
as an upgrade midway through the game. This is detailed in the Launchers
section.

#### Marksman Rifle 1960

This semi-automatic rifle is about the same length as the AR, but fires a
heftier round (likely 7.92x57mm) from a 10-round magazine. It has an integral
scope. It's a relatively rare find both in the hands of enemies and as
loot. Clearly the Nazis are bigger fans of the spray-and-pray approach to
marksmanship.

An extended 30-round magazine is available: Shots 30+1(3), Weight becomes
6.2/1.05kg. The gun can also fire APHC rounds: Dam 6d+2(2) pi-.

In The New Colossus, you turned the Assault Rifle into this when you installed a
scope on it, but I think it makes more sense to keep it as a separate weapon.

#### Shockhammer Model 1960

Another descendant of the gun from The Old Blood, this one uses a "snail drum"
magazine and a single barrel to achieve better performance than its
predecessor. The most commonly available shells for the weapon are standard
buckshot, and "shrapnel".

Shrapnel shells fire red-hot fragments that ricochet off walls in a very
video-gamey way, allowing the player to hit enemies behind cover or around
corners by bouncing the shrapnel off the wall behind them. The shotgun can only
fire in semi-auto mode while using these shells.

For the GURPS version below, I'm treating shrapnel as Multi-Flechette shells
(High-Tech p. 174) with an incendiary effect. Damage becomes 1d+1 pi- inc; Range
becomes 100/1200; RoF becomes 3x20. GMs who wish to replicate the ricochet
effect can reduce the penalty for firing at targets behind cover when there are
suitable surfaces nearby.

At the GM's discretion, any special shells listed in High Tech and Ultra-Tech
might also be available for this shotgun.

#### Rotary Shotgun

Found in fixed mounts and occasionally wielded by cyborg supersoldiers, this
heavy weapon has 4 rotary barrels and fires 12G shotgun shells at an alarming
rate of fire from a big box drum. With its default load of buckshot, it's of
questionable use against well-protected targets. Its main use is as an
anti-infantry and anti-civilian terror weapon.

Since this fires the same ammo as the Shockhammer, you could conceivably load it
with any special shells that also fit the other weapon. Just like in the game,
though, this is likely to be a "sometimes gun" found in the field and quickly
discarded when it runs dry or when it's no longer practical to lug around. You
use whatever it comes loaded with, and then throw it away.

If using the standard skill system, the weapon is used with either Guns (LMG) or
Gunner (Machine Gun) depending on whether it's mounted or not.

#### Long Arms Table


| TL  | Weapon         | Damage   | Acc | Range    | Weight       | RoF  | Shots   | ST  | Bulk | Rcl |
|:---:|:--------------:|:--------:|:---:|:--------:|:------------:|:----:|:-------:|:---:|:----:|:----|
| 7   | Thompson M1A1  | 2d+1 pi+ | 3   | 170/1900 | 6.1kg/0.8kg  | 11   | 30+1(3) | 10† | -5   | 2   |
| 7   | MP-61          | 4d pi-   | 4   | 170/1900 | 3.1kg/0.4kg  | 13   | 45+1(3) | 8†  | -4*  | 2   |
| 8   | Assault Rifle  | 5d pi    | 5   | 500/3100 | 5.5kg/1kg    | 12   | 45+1(3) | 9†  | -5   | 2   |
| 8   | Marksman Rifle | 6d+2 pi  | 5   | 850/3750 | 5.5kg/0.35kg | 3    | 10+1(3) | 10† | -5   | 2   |
| 8   | Shockhammer    | 1d+1 pi  | 3   | 40/800   | 7.1kg/1.05kg | 6x9  | 20(5)   | 11† | -5   | 1/7 |
| 8+1 | Rotary Shotgun | 1d+1 pi  | 3   | 40/800   | 25kg/10kg    | 12x9 | 200(10) | 15M | -8   | 1   |


### Energy Weapons

There is a surprising amount of energy weapons in both games. All of these use
Beam Weapons (Rifle) unless noted otherwise.

Laser weapons in this setting draw power from internal batteries that can't be
removed without disassembling the weapon. The usual method of reloading them is
by using one of the highly dangerous industrial power outlets that seem to be
everywhere in Nazi-dominated cities and facilities.

In The New Order, these use short-ranged wireless power transfer. In The New
Colossus, they use a thick with a plug that resembles a gas station pump. I suggest
picking an aesthethic and sticking to it.

**Wireless Charging**: The wielder must stay within 2 meters of the outlet
during the process, which causes lightning to arc between the outlet and the
weapon's power receptors. Doing anything with the weapon other than holding it
steady will interrupt the recharge.

**Wired Charging**: The wielder must plug the cable into the weapon (1 Ready
Action), and then stay within 1 meter of the outlet. The weapon cannot be used
while charging. Once charging is done, it takes another Ready maneuver to unplug
it.

Recharge time is listed for each weapon, and has more to do with the weapon's
ability to absorb incoming power than with the outlet's ability to provide it!
The later seems to be effectively limitless, at least on a personal scale. Yes,
these things are extremely unsafe.

In some places you can also find portable batteries that can be used to top up a
weapon through a similar process. The GM will say how many shots from a weapon
an individual battery can recharge.

#### Lunar Laser Rifle

On the Moonbase level of The New Order, everyone carries a laser weapon with the
same external appearance as the Marksman Rifle. It lacks a scope, and can fire
in full-auto mode. Its performance seems to be about on par with the assault
rifle, though it is a lot better at dealing with heavily-armored
enemies. Industrial outlets recharge it at 3 shots per second.

Despite being a laser weapon based on the Marksman Rifle, Nazi soldiers don't
usually use Aim maneuvers with it, so they are not more accurate than usual when
wielding it.

It doesn't exist in The New Colossus, not even in Venus. Maybe it was a pet
project of Deathshead's for the moon base, and got phased out when he died.

#### Marksman Rifle (Combined)

When you return to Earth after the Moonbase level, B.J.'s Marksman Rifle becomes
a combination gadget of sorts, with the scope on a hinged mount. With the mount
closed and the scope in place, it fires bullets as before. With the scope folded
away, it behaves like the Moonbase laser rifle.

This design is probably more of a video game quality of life decision than
something feasible in setting, but if you want to include it in your campaigns
you can treat it as a Combination Gadget per the rules on Ultra-Tech p. 16.

Under those rules, Weight becomes 8kg/0.35kg (or 8.7/1.05 with the extended
mag). Switching modes requires a Ready maneuver, and the weapon uses the Damage,
Acc, Range, RoF, Shots and ST of whatever version is the currently active
one. Keep track of both ammo counts separately!

#### Laserkraftwerk

This is an experimental laser weapon that B. J. "liberates" from a lab early in
The New Order. It's about carbine-sized, and fires shots that are more powerful
than those of the lunar laser rifle.

The LKW also has an alternate "laser cutter" module that's useful for quietly
severing chains and cutting through chain-link fences and thin metal walls. This
does 2d(2) burn and can run continuously for half an hour on a full battery, if
it matters.

Over the course of the game, the player can find several upgrades for the LKW,
including a scope, an higher-capacity battery, and new internal parts that allow
it to fire more often or to fire a more powerful "charged" shot that's better at
dealing with large and heavily armored opponents.

In the Weapon Table below, you get stats both for the baseline version and the
fully-upgraded one.

Industrial outlets recharge the weapon at a rate of 1 shot per second with the
standard battery, or 2 shots per second with the expanded one. The final upgrade
in The New Order is an "even more superscience" Da'at Yichud portable reactor
that recharges the weapon at a rate of 1 shot per 2 seconds whenever it's not
being fired, regardless of its battery size.

#### Laser Machine Gun

Like the Heavy Shotgun, this weapon is found in fixed mounts or in the hands of
cybernetic supersoldiers. It's also standard armament on the many models of
enemy giant robot. It can fire a full-auto laser barrage for quite a bit before
running dry. Enemies don't like to aim with it either, improving the players'
chances of survival when facing it. It's heavy and bulky enough to be only a
"sometimes" gun for the player, used when found and quickly discarded when
empty.

Industrial outlets reload it at a rate of 20 shots per second. Fixed mounts also
connect the gun to external power, allowing it to recharge as if using an
industrial outlet while not being fired.

This uses Gunner (Beams) whether mounted or carried.

*: See description for recharge time.

**: Drains power equivalent to 5 shots from the battery.

### Grenades and Launchers

Enemy soldiers are enthusiastic about using hand grenades in the The New Order,
and only a little less so in The New Colossus. Launcher weapons are much rarer.

The Tesla Grenade (below) is the only one used in The New Order. In the New
Colossus, most enemies use a standard explosive grenade, with a rare few using
the incendiary one.

#### Explosive Grenade

A standard high-explosive warhead with limited fragmentation in a compact
egg-shaped package. This is the most common grenade as of The New Colossus.

#### Incendiary Grenade

Shaped similarly to the high-explosive variant, this one sprays burning fuel
around the epicenter of its detonation, likely causing fires.

#### Tesla Grenade

This one looks like a modernized version of the Stick Hand Grenade used back
in 1946. Its explosive power is equivalent, but also releases an electromagnetic
pulse that can "stun" robotic and cybernetic enemies in a 4-meter radius from
the epicenter of the explosion. They must make a HT-8(2) roll or be knocked out
of action for seconds equal to their marging of failure. That (2) means that any
electromagnetic shielding that would provide a bonus to this roll only works at
half effectiveness.

This _also_ applies to laser weapons of any kind, which usually have HT 12.

#### Kampfpistole 1960

This one is quite similar to the 1946 model, but takes larger cylinders with a
6-round capacity. It fires a newer model of rocket with a more powerful charge
and a less safe arming distance.

This is only issued to certain high-ranking elite officers, more as a symbol of
status than something they're expected to use in combat. It can be "procured" at
any facilities where such officers are posted, either from their bodies or from
storage lockers.

#### Underbarrel Rocket Launcher

An accessory compatible with the 1960 Assault Rifle, this launcher fires a
larger rocket than the Kampfpistole from a cylinder with a 4-round
capacity. It's issued to soldiers that are expected to go against
heavily-armored opposition, and who are usually heavily-armored themselves.
