Today's template is the Thief, which means today's character is Merisiel. Here
she is:

We're back in familiar territory with Merisiel, as she's one of the Iconics from
the core book. Her bio is [here][10] and her stats are [here][11]. From these,
we can learn the following:

- Merisiel is one of the Forlorn, an elf raised among humans. They get this
  depressing name because Pathfinder elves are of the type that takes nearly a
  century to grow up. She spent these decades as a street urchin who stowed away
  on ships bound for different cities when her current buddies outgrew her.

- She's not the sharpest knife in the drawer but makes up for that by carrying a
  lot of really sharp knives on her person. She tries to start every combat
  hidden.

- Merisiel has an open and expressive personality, always tries to have fun in
  the moment, and is always chasing the next get-rich-quick scheme.

Despite being pretty much a bog-standard d20/Pathfinder character, Merisiel
presents us with several interesting challenges when it comes to adapting her to
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**.

First of all, she's an elf, but _which type_ of elf?  There's like a hundred of
them in **Dungeon Fantasy 3**. Pathfinder's stats for elves would suggest the
High Elf racial template is appropriate. That's not all, however! Merisiel is a
_Forlorn_ elf, which means she grew up among humans and had no contact with
elven culture to speak of. And the **DF 3** elf template that best models that
is the _Half_-Elf. Theoretically full-blooded elves would have longer lifespans
and such, but that's not worth any points in a **DF** campaign.

The other challenge is finding the appropriate template for her. The Thief
template from **DF 1** is a lot closer to the Thief class from early D&D - a
middling combatant who's great at stealth, trap-finding, and reaching difficult
places. The d20 Rogue class is still good at those non-combat things, but its
main focus is stabbing monsters for massive damage. This is why Merisiel's
Pathfinder stats give her a rapier despite her bio's focus on knives - it's the
best melee weapon for rogues in that system. I'm going to use the Thief template
here, since it's the whole point of this post, but I don't want to leave the
stabbing part entirely out. I'll try to sneak some of the Swashbuckler lens in
here, with a focus on knives.

Indeed, I have my work cut out for me, having to fit _both_ a racial template
and a "multiclass" lens in a 250-point budget!
