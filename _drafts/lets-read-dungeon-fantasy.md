If you only read this blog through the GURPS Day feed, you might not know I've
been doing a series of extensive "Let's Read" projects of all the D&D 4th
Edition Monster Manuals and the Neverwinter Campaign Setting. I like those
project! They're easy to write for.

However, since none of its posts are GURPS articles, they don't get into the
feed and I don't announce them on the GURPS-only forums and social networks I
frequent. And I really want something that can appear there regularly.

I have a whole bunch of more "serious" posts I want to write but I find myself
making no progress at all with them. I need something that flows more easily
from brain to keyboard, something I can get out there regularly, something
that's fun to write.

So Let's Read the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game! I have it right here
