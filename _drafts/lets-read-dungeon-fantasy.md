If you only read this blog through the GURPS Day feed, you might not know I've
been doing a series of extensive "Let's Read" projects of all the D&D 4th
Edition Monster Manuals and the Neverwinter Campaign Setting. I like those
project! They're easy to write for.

However, since none of its posts are GURPS articles, they don't get into the
feed and I don't announce them on the GURPS-only forums and social networks I
frequent. And I really want something that can appear there regularly.

I have a whole bunch of more "serious" posts I want to write but I find myself
making no progress at all with them. I need something that flows more easily
from brain to keyboard, something I can get out there regularly, something
that's fun to write.

So Let's Read the Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game! This post will introduce you
to the dungeon fantasy genre and to this game in particular.

If you're a long-time reader of this blog, you already know all of this! But I'm
going to cross-post this to RPG.net, and a lot of readers from there won't, so
let's recap a bit.

## What Is Dungeon Fantasy?

"Dungeon Fantasy" is the name of the very specific sub-genre of fantasy that
Dungeons & Dragons arguably created. It's probably the most popular genre in the
tabletop RPG hobby, though people tend lump it in with the broader "fantasy" or
"medieval fantasy" because the "dungeon" aspect is usually so ubiquitous it's
invisible[^1].

At the core of it, dungeon fantasy is about a band of adventurers going into
dungeons to kill monsters and loot treasure. It can certainly feature other
things, like the intrigue, melodrama, and worldbuilding that makes so many
settings, stories and campaigns memorable... but that particular activity is
still your core gameplay loop. At some point in a dungeon fantasy story, your
group is going to delve a dungeon that has both hostile monsters and treasure.

## What is the DFRPG?

The Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game is a tabletop RPG released by Steve Jackson
Games in 2017, after a successful Kickstarter campaign. This is a "Powered by
GURPS" title, which means it uses GURPS rules as a base but _does not_ require
any GURPS books to play, and may have different _base assumptions_ from those in
core GURPS.

I wrote a review of the game back in 2017 when I acquired it. As I said in that
review, [DFRPG is my second-favorite edition of D&D][2]. We will be reading
through the boxed set in this series, and leaving our pre-conceived notions
about GURPS behind as we do so. That'll let us look at it with fresh eyes.



[^1]: There are plenty of "non-dungeon" fantasy games out there, of course, but
    we won't be talking about them in this particular series.
