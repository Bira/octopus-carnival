GURPS Martial Arts is one of my favorite GURPS books because it takes an
amazingly inclusive and comprehensive approach to the subject compared to older
games from the 80's and 90's. It recognizes that pretty much every culture has a
martial arts tradition and provides writeups for styles from all around the
world and all through history[^1]. It gives every one of those styles access to
cinematic options based on the legends about their practitioners. Even with
those cinematic options, though, these styles mostly add a bit of flavor to the
combat skills already present in the basic rules. A 18 in Broadsword is a 18 in
Broadsword whether it comes from Kenjutsu, Kalaripayit, or Roman legionnary
training.

This mirrors modern thinking about martial arts, at least as I perceive it with
my decidedly non-expert eyes: there are only so many ways for a human body to
move, so "what's effective in a fight" doesn't really change all that much from
style to style[^2]. When the chips are down, your individual skill matters a lot
more than what style you trained in.

I liked this approach so much I sorta internalized it after reading the book
enough times. For this reason, Exalted's approach to the same subject gave me a
bit of cognitive dissonance when I came back to it in its Third Edition.

I mean, yeah, I've followed Exalted since a short while after it was first
published, and I learned a lot from it in terms of GMing style and such. But
even though the first two editions were published in the 21st century they were
very much "older games" when it came to their treatment of martial arts.

Martial Arts in Exalted First Edition had their own skill whose Charms were
organized in a very different manner from the others. A normal skill gave you
one or two Charm "trees" per Exalt type, but Martial Arts had a large number of
"style trees", each of varying power that any Exalt could learn. You could use
the Charms of a style with unarmed attacks, or with a handful of weapons
specified in each style's description.

This means pretty much no one ever took the Brawl skill in my
experience. Martial Arts served the same purpose and pretty much always gave you
access to better (or at least _cooler_) powers. As more styles came out, Melee
started getting a little behind as well, because some styles gave you access to
some of the best weapons Melee had to offer too.

Second edition did away with Brawl entirely, replacing it with Martial
Arts. Former Brawl charms were organized into "hero styles" that weren't
anything special power-wise but could be learned more easily and combined with
Charms from other styles by the associated Exalt types. I hadn't read GURPS MA
yet, but this looked like its approach and I already liked that way of seeing
things.

I stopped playing Exalted 2 for several reasons a while later, and got more
heavily into GURPS. When Exalted Third Edition was announced to be in
development, promising a big overhaul of the martial arts system, I started
fantasizing about a set of rules that mirrored GURPS's approach more
closely. You'd still have style trees, but they wouldn't be tied to a
special skill at all - armed styles would be based on Melee (or Archery, or
Thrown), unarmed on Brawl. I mean, Exalted's entire Charm system was already
built to remember cinematic kung fu, so I never saw any need to have a "double
kung fu" system on top of that.

Much to my surprise, Exalted Third Edition doubled down on the 90's
angle. Martial Arts as a special skill was back, and now you had to buy the
whole skill all over again for each separate style you had. Non-Martial Arts
powers were explicitly described as "innate magic" whose wielders weren't even
aware they were using distinct powers. They were still cool, mechanically, but
fluff-wise they were pretty much the super-powered equivalent of "ignorantly
swinging a sword around instead of training in _real_ kung fu".

[^1]: Not in all combinations - no Pre-Columbian styles from the New World, for
    example. I imagine information on those would be pretty hard to find, but
    there are guidelines to create your own version if you do find it.

[^2]: Provided these styles were designed for actual fighting - not all are!
