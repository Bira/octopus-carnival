Strictly speaking, every delver is a martial artist - the amount of points they
put into weapon skills could easily earn them black belts or the equivalent in
real life. A little less strictly, the Knight and Swashbuckler are still
definitely martial artists, because they dedicate a large part of their lives to
studying a formal system of fighting and being good at that is their main
function.

_This_ Martial Artist however, is the kind who's freshly graduated from an
ascetic monastery in a faraway land or perhaps from a local mystical
sect. They've learned a form of unarmed combat that's better than what the other
professions learn, and they wield weapons that can seem pretty exotic to those
other delvers. Most importantly, they learned how to harness their inner
strength through special exercises and meditation, and they can use that to
manifest supernatural powers.

If this description sounds a bit orientalist, well, that's how you know this is
a version of the D&D Monk. The description can be stripped away easily enough,
though then you still have to put up with some legacy skill and power names that
were imported straight from the GURPS core and show up in this template.

Mechanically, the draw of the Martial Artist are those special powers. If you
just want to hit things really well and deal lots of damage, you might be better
served by one of the other fighty professions. But if you want to walk on water,
run up walls, perform giant flying leaps, and paralyze people by hitting their
pressure points, then this is the profession for you.

## Basic Stats

The basic stat line for the Martial Artist is ST 11, DX 16, IQ 10, HT 12. That
gives them Speed 7.0 exactly. Their Will is increased to 11, and their Move to
8, making them the fastest-running profession at character creation.

## Advantages

Every Martial Artist starts with two levels of **Chi Talent** and the **Trained
by a Master** advantage. The former is their Power Talent, and the latter is
similar to the Knight's Weapon Master. The difference is that it doesn't give a
damage bonus, but it gives access to many more special skills and works for all
unarmed attacks and muscle-powered weapons.

They have 40 points to distribute between optional advantages, which include the
usual stat boosts, stuff useful for combat, and some advantages representing
great mental resilience. Weapon Master also makes an appearance here, in its
20-point version that covers any one single weapon. The book says "one exotic
weapon", but the extra qualifier is only there to keep things in-theme.

## Disadvantages

The mandatory disadvantage here is **Disciplines of Faith** (Chi Rituals). This
represents the special exercises you must perform daily to keep your inner
strength up and access your special powers. They eat into your free time, but if
you skip even one day you can't use your powers for a while.

Discretionary advantages include stuff that represents being a foreigner or
having a strict code of conduct, monastic vows you might have taken, lower
starting Wealth, and even stuff for reckless braggarts like a vow to always
fight unarmed.

Yes, Social Stigma (Minority Group) is optional for Martial Artists. Not all of
them come from a mysterious faraway land. I remember seeing one who was a local
dwarf who worn plate mail and fought using twin battleaxes as weapons.

## Skills

You always know the "good" unarmed combat skills, named Judo (for grappling) and
Karate (for striking). Everyone else has to make do with less "advanced"
versions that are easier to learn, like Wrestling and Brawling. This is the
largest bit of legacy gunk we haven't yet managed to shed.

The choice of combat skill package determines if you know these unarmed skills
at 15 plus two weapons at 17, unarmed at 16 and one weapon at 17, or one unarmed
skill at 17 and the other at 16. These are pretty good starting levels, but are
still behind what other dedicated combatants get to start. The weapon list
includes stuff we've seen already, but also some "signature" skills like Tonfa,
Jitte/Sai, and Kusari.

For ranged combat, you probably use thrown weapons. Your list of default
non-combat skills is sparse, but very focused on mobility. Optional skills are
the usual delver package.

You then get to choose seven special skills from quite a large list. These are
basically low-key superpowers of the sort you would expect to see in a D&D
monk. Some are DX-based, others based on IQ or Will, and all get a bonus equal
to your level of Chi Talent. More on them below.

## Special Martial Artist Traits

If we don't count spell descriptions for the casters, since they live in a
separate book, then Martial Artists have the largest special traits section
among the professions. It consists of _Chi Mastery_ powers, and the many
_special skills_ tied to Training by a Master.

In both cases, _Chi Talent_ gives its level as a bonus to any tests associated
with the power, or to the skill level directly. It's more expensive than any
other talent we have seen so far, because it enhances a lot of stuff. The name
of this talent is also the last bit of legacy scuff we have to deal with.

### Chi Abilities

These powers have Disciplines of Faith (Chi Rituals) as a prerequisite. These
rituals consume 1d hours of your free time each day, and their special dietary
requirements mean your rations cost double. If you skip a day, you must spend
a full day rebalancing your chi, or your powers will burn out for a while when
you next call upon them.

Like Holy Might or Nature's Power, these abilities don't count as magic and are
not affected by anti-magic measures.

- **Dragon Skin** (5 points): Gives you DR 2 and generally works like the
  Barbarian's Tough Skin, but cheaper because it's part of a power.

- **Mantis Strike** (9 points): This is two levels of Striking ST, again cheaper
  because it's part of a power.

- **Regeneration** (23 points): You automatically heal 1 HP per hour no matter
  what you're doing, and you roll for natural healing twice as often. Your HT
  rolls for natural healing benefit from your Chi Talent.

- **Seven Secret Kicks** (7 points): You don't have the usual -2 penalty for
  attacking with a kick, and your kicks do +1 bonus damage per die. You still
  need to roll to avoid falling down if you miss, but Chi Talent benefits those
  rolls.

- **Spider Climb** (18 points): You can crawl or walk on walls and ceilings, and
  can stop at any point there without fear of falling. If you're falling a long
  distance and are near a wall, you can grip it to try and stop the fall or at
  least reduce its damage. Chi Talent aids the rolls for this.

- **Tiger Sprint** (9 or 18 points): You can run at 1.5 or 2 times your normal
  Move when out of combat, and sprinting in combat gives you the same
  multiplier. Chi Talent benefits any rolls to aid your movement while running
  (including stuff like Jumping and Acrobatics for parkour).

- **Unarmed Master** (25 points): An absolute necessity if you want to
  specialize in unarmed combat. This eliminates the chance of hurting yourself
  when striking hard surfaces, and doesn't let enemies automatically shift their
  target to your limbs if you fail a parry. It also grants a +1 per die bonus to
  your unarmed damage, which does stack with Seven Secret Kicks.

- **Uninterrupted Flurry** (20 points): Once per battle, you can speed up and
  take 2 actions per turn instead of just one, for the next 1d turns. Ora ora
  ora!

### Special Skills

The Trained By a Master advantage halves your penalty for multiple attacks and
defenses in a turn, and gives you access to all of these skills. Their skill
level is also enhanced by your Chi Talent level. You can use the skills even if
your abilites are burned out, though in that case you don't get the Talent bonus
to them.

There's a lot of skills here, and you get to pick seven from your
template. This is where the "walk on water, run up walls, perform giant flying
leaps, and paralyze people by poking them" magic happens. This is also where
your actual ranged combat skill lives if you have any interest in it at all, as
it lets you throw anything and gives a damage bonus to those attacks.

## Customization

Martial Artists suffer from a problem similar to the D&D Monk in that their
set of abilities pulls them in several different, sometimes competing,
directions. Standard advantages, Chi powers, combat skills, esoteric
skills... There's some real nice out-of-combat utility spread through here, but
choosing it does mean accepting you'll be less effective at punching people for
a while.

Unarmed specialists cannot afford to wait that long. They need Unarmed Master
right away to make up the damage deficit and to keep their limbs
intact. Breaking Blow, the special skill that lets you bypass DR, is also
important, and requires a lot of points to be reliable mid-fight. Those who rely
on weapons, "exotic" or otherwise, end up being more versatile out of the gate,
as they can spread their points around more.

The book states this represents an Martial Artist fresh off the monastery, so it
is indeed lacking in non-combat mundane skills. A few points from quirks can
make a huge difference either in shoring up those differences... or getting more
powers and better combat skills. As a Martial Artist you're not hurting for
money unless you choose a sword as your main weapon. The other options are
pretty cheap, and leave them with enough change to buy some decent hand and foot
armor for when they need to fight unarmed.

Yes, that does mean that in a funny enough campaign you might be able to spot a
martial artist by their tattered robes and immaculately maintained heavy boots
and gauntlets.
