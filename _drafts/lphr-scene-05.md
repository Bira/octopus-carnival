# Intro

Our last scene was the first half of a small dungeon delve. The party arrived at
the Fair Fortune Livery after some shopping, negotiated with the small grimble
community living in its ruined basement, and learned of "foul demons" inhabiting
a "cursed land" next door to them.

They accessed a section of old buried city streets, and fought two lemures and
some giant rats who made their homes there. Then they resumed exploring the
underground area in search of the Silver Raven hideout.

# Mythic Bookkeeping

The fight was actually a bit more chaotic than I anticipated. The opposition was
kinda weak but that last lemure took a lot of killing and managed to inflict
some damage before it was taken down. Let's increase the Chaos Factor to 6.

Let's also add the Livery Grimbles as "characters". In the default campaign they
were enemies to be exterminated, but here they're peaceful and might come up
again.

**Threads**

- The Path
- Find the Missing Elves (Arcturus)
- Find Shensen (Rosalia)
- Contacting Ms. Docur (Jania)
- Get Organized (Jade)

**Characters**

- The Dottari
- The Chelish Citizens Group
- The Red Jills
- The Asmodeans
- The Three-Legged Devil
- The Livery Grimples

Our PCs are progressing along The Path by continuing to delve the livery. This
next scene is meant to cover the rest of the delve, ending when they leave the
dungeon.

I roll a d10 and come up with a 7, which means there are no surprise alterations
here.

# Preparation Work

Time to plan what's ahead. First of all: do I even _want_ to include
Blosodriette here?

She's CR 4, and appears at a time when Pathfinder 1e PCs would be level 1. She
has unreasonably high Stealth, at-will Invisibility, and her contract is
disguised with an illusion spell the PCs can't pierce at this level. She also
has a wand of Acid Arrow with 9 charges, which could make short work of a level
1 party.

So clearly the book means for her to stay hidden, follow the PCs to their new
hideout, and engage in sabotage during the back half of the adventure. The PCs
are only meant to find her shortly before the end of the adventure, when their
higher level and better gear makes fighting her a more reasonable proposition.

However, her sabotage is _super annoying_ to deal with when playing solo. And
our PCs are already powerful enough to take her on, and even to detect her
presence right here. So I think I'll let that happen, and run the fight here.

## Blosodriette

We start with the stats for a Hrogn from the Nordlond Bestiary, which is
equivalent to the D&D imp. We then replace the claw attack with a Stinger (a
piercing Striker). And we add some rogue stuff and items on top of that.

ST 6; DX 12; IQ 12; HT 11;

Dodge 11; SM -3

DR 2;

HP 6; Will 12; Per 12; FP --;

Speed 8.00; Move 8 (Flight Move 5).

- Stinger (12): 1d-3 pi + 1d toxic follow-up. Roll HT-2 or become nauseated for
  1d minutes. Reach C.

  - Stinger Backstab (12): 1d+2 pi + 1d toxic follow-up. Roll HT-2 or become
    nauseated for 1d minutes. Reach C. Only on unaware targets who don't get a
    defense roll.

- Tiny Blowpipe (12): Acc 1, Range 6. 1 pi + 1d toxic follow-up. Roll HT-2 or
  become nauseated for 1d minutes.

- Lesser Wand of Explosive Fireball (12): Acc 1, Range 25/50, 1d burn ex.

Relevant Traits: Invisibility (selective), Injury Reduction 2 (non-magic
damage), No Blood, No Neck, No Vitals, Backstabber 10.

Gear: Tiny blowpipe, 10 envenomed darts, Pipes of the Sewers, Lesser Wand of
Explosive Fireball with 10 charges (worth $1600).

## Blosodriette's Loot

- The "Tiny Blowpipe" is like the blowpipe on Adventurers, but with a max range
  of ST instead of STx4. It's worthless and not suitable for PC use.

- The Lesser Wand of Explosive Fireball replaces the Wand of Acid Arrow from the
  book. Per DF Magic Items 1, it'd be worth $9600 with the full 60 charges, so
  it's only worth $1600 with 10. It's a short baton. $1600, 0.25kg.

- Pipes of the Sewers: A set of pipes ($40, 0.5kg) enchanted with Beast
  Summoning (Rats) ($8000) and Rat Control ($4000). I'm using the price for
  Vermin Control here because it's only a single animal type instead of the more
  general categories. Playing the pipes summons a rat swarm and casts Rat
  Control on it (two separate spellcasting rolls at power 15 each). It works
  once per day (+$680). This is a _bardic_ item, and Bardic Talent applies to
  the rolls instead of Power Investiture (Druidic). It requires the appropriate
  Musical Instrument skill. The spells only last for as long as the song
  continues. $12720, 0.5kg.

- Gold-and-platinum signet ring worn as an armband ($1500), embroidered silk
  scarf worn as a wrap ($400).

## Additional Loot In The Room

First Crate:

- A pouch with a dozen pearls worth $1000 each. (total $12000)
- A Balanced Pistol, from Pyramid #3/36: Acc 2, Range 75/450, Weight 1.5/0.005,
  RoF 1, Shots 1(20), damage 2d-1 pi+. $1000, 1.5kg.
- A Balanced Silver-Coated Dwarven Mace: +1 to skill, sw+3 cr, reach 1,
  Parry 0. $550, 2.5kg.
- A suit of Light Leather armor with a Fortify +1 enchantment. $1150, 9kg.

The second crate has a locked iron box. DR 6, HP 18, unmodified Lockpicking test
to open. Inside is:

- Charged Universal Scroll of Hide Emotions (1 hour duration): $200, neg.
- Charged Universal Scroll of Hide Thoughts (30 mins duration): $500, neg.
- Charged Universal Scroll of Scryguard (10 hour duration): $300, neg.
- Charged Universal Scroll of Light Thread (10 minute duration): $200, neg.
- The documents which are the goal of this whole delve.

The third crate has six Silver Raven Figurines of Wondrous Power. These can turn
to life-sized mechanical ravens on command. The user can then use it like a D&D
Animal Messenger. This means they can mentally imprint a location on the raven
and have it carry a letter there, waiting for a specified amount of time and
allowing the letter to be removed during that wait. Then it returns, possibly
bearing a response.

# Actual Play

## The Old Hideout

Mechanically, we're going with [this procedure][1] for the exploration, and I
think it's fair to say this includes Urist's Detect Evil rolls. I'd argue for
that if I was his player!

The party arrives here on their second exploration turn, take in the ruined
ambience, and decide to spend another exploration turn searching the place. This
is a no-brainer, really. So we get to make some Perception rolls for them.

- Jania spots the nest in the corner, and notes it seems to have been recently
  used by a tiny humanoid creature.

- Rosalia notices the three boxes of Stuff.

- Urist's Detect Evil power finds that there's a demon in the area, but none of
  the others can find anything with their mundane senses.

Blosodriette is invisible and trying to be sneaky. I'm giving her Stealth 15,
and no one could beat that with their Hearing rolls. I do think all of this
would make Jania cast See Invisible, and I want to say that'd let them spot her
because she'd be relying on her invisibility to stay hidden. Call it a +10
modifier to Jania's Perception because the imp is now in plain sight for
her. With the bonus, Jania succeeds by 14 while B only succeeds by 7.
