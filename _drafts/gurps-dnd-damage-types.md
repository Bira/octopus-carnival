One thing I often find myself doing these days is converting between D&D/d20 and
GURPS, mainly because I'm running a Pathfinder adventure using the DFRPG and
might soon run another. And now I find myself in need of some structured
thinking about damage types.

From its third edition onwards, D&D and its derivatives get very particular
about damage types, but they do so in a way that's distinctly different from
GURPS. Damage types in D&D has a lot to do with how an attack _looks_, while in
GURPS it's all about _the wound it makes_. This means their "energy" damage
types don't match up. Resistance to burning damage in GURPS potentially protects
you from fire, lightning and ice because all of them cause burns.

When you're playing a D&D-inspired game like Dungeon Fantasy, you might want to
have a set of "elemental" damage types that more closely mirrors that of
D&D. The published Dungeon Fantasy material already kinda does this, with
established shorthands for the different types of elemental damage, but it
doesn't go as far as officially codifying them. So let's do that here!

First I'll present the list of codified damage types, with their effects
expressed in terms of GURPS mechanics and their costs and inherent modifiers as
Innate Attacks. Then I'll describe how having these in your campaign modifies
the possible limitations on defensive advantages.

## Elemental Damage Types

**Fire**, **Acid** and **Poison** are just new names for standard burning,
corrosive and toxic damage. They use all the standard GURPS rules for these:
Fire may set fires, Acid can corrode armor, and so on. When buying these things
as Innate Attacks, use the prices as written.

Other common "elemental" damage types require more explanation.

- **Cold** damage is for _energy_ attacks that use "elemental cold" as a
  basis. They do burning damage with the No Incendiary Effect (-10%) modifier,
  and might be able to extinguish natural fires.

  Some cold attacks might have the ability to slow or paralyze the target, but
  that's not an inherent property of elemental cold damage. Buy that as a
  separate linked affliction if necessary.

  "Cold" attacks that form ice weapons actually do physical damage of the
  appropriate type, and are not technically cold attacks at all. Such weapons
  might have follow-up cold damage, though.

- **Lightning** attacks do burning damage with the Surge modifier.
