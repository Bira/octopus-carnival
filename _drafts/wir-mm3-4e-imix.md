Sit down dear readers, for there's a lot of lore coming your way. Imix himself
first appeared in the Fiend Folio for AD&D 1e, along with the other Elemental
Princes. His writeup here also melds two classic stories from the 1e era.

## The Lore

So, as it's been mentioned a few times before, the god Tharizdun is probably the
most evil asshole in all of 4e's implied setting. Before even the Dawn War, he
came across a shard of cosmic evil, and decided to use that in a bid to conquer
the universe. He planted this shard in the Elemental Chaos as if it was a seed,
and from this seed sprouted the Abyss. Tharizdun used the Abyss to generate an
innumerable host of demons. Some of these were created through corruption (of
elementals, of his own servants, and others). Others were formed directly from
abyssal energies under Tharizdun's direction.

A lot of things happened after that but it suffices to say that Tharizdun's
attempt at conquest ultimately failed and the god was imprisoned by his peers in
the most secure prison they could conceive. His name was erased from all records
of the gods, some say from reality itself. We only know it because we're the
readers and we're outside the setting.

Fast-forward to the time of the Dawn War. The gods are slowly winning, for they
are capable of teamwork and their proud enemies are not. Except, that is, for a
group of 5 Primordials who were contacted by a mysterious entity that introduced
itself as the Elder Elemental Eye. The contacted Primordials believed they had
just lucked into a direct line to the _first_ Primordial, and so they readily
accepted its offer of power in exchange for loyalty. They called themselves the
Elemental Princes from that point onward.

The alliance between the Elemental Princes was far from ironclad, but it was
enough to allow them to get through the War with both their lives and their
freedom. They're still out there, in the Elemental Chaos, plotting to overthrow
the gods and free their master.

Spoiler alert: The Elder Elemental Eye is a pseudonym for Tharizdun. Serving and
worshipping the Eye funnels power to the Chained God so that he might one day
break free of his prison.

This entry concerns Imix, the Evil Elemental Prince of Fire. As the name
implies, he represents all the bad things one usually associates with
fire. Uncontrolled passions, rage, indiscriminate destruction. Though he is
technically free, Imix lives in a state of self-imposed house arrest. He has a
stronghold built into the caldera of an active volcano, and he never leaves
it. His attempts to influence the world and advance his plan all go through his
agents and cultists.

Imix's cult in the middle world is unusually large and active for a
primordial's. It accepts misanthropes, murderers, and those who are angry at the
world and willing to swear any oath for the power to take revenge. Whatever
their individual reasons might be, they eventually cease to matter, as advancing
in the cult means having pieces of your free will burned away until your only
wish is to do Imix's bidding and help free the Eye.

They usually hide out among sapient communities and sow division and discord,
encouraging its inhabitants to rebel and fight among themselves. Their temples
tend to be built inside ruins and other scary places. The cultists protect them
vigilantly and burn anyone who gets too close to death.

More important temples are usually dedicated to the Elder Elemental Eye and
protected by two or more Elemental Prince cults, who spend as much time
sabotating and upstating one another as they do actually advancing the Eye's
cause. The cult's greatest seat of power is the legendary Temple of Elemental
Evil, protected and operated by all the Elemental Prince cults and any
mercenaries and servants they manage to recruit.

## The Monsters

This entry contains stats both for Imix himself and for a wide range of cultists
and servitors that go from mid-Heroic to late Epic. I'm going to list them in
order of increasing level with Imix at the end, which is not exactly how the
book does it.

The cultist lineup here is pretty diverse, species-wise, for the Fire Lord isn't
picky like those posers Yeenoghu and Baphomet. He'll find a use for anyone
willing to swear the oaths, even if that use is "walking bomb". You can always
mix these stat blocks with more typical stat blocks for humans and other
humanoid opposition, reskinned or not.

### Fire Lord Cultist

This Level 5 Minion Brute represents the bulk of the cult's low-ranking
followers. They have a speed of 6 and fight with torches and **clubs**. Their
melee attacks deal extra damage if they're adjacent to an ally, so they have an
incentive to cluster around a PC.

They can also use that torch in the **Ignite** ability. This encounter power is
a melee attack that targets Reflex and deals ongoing 5 fire damage (save
ends). Make sure this is their first attack, because they might not get a chance
to use it otherwise.

### Servant of the Fire Lord

A more senior and better-trained cultist. Servants of the Fire Lord tend to hide
out in sapient communities disguised as clerics of more benign deities. They use
this cover to undermine the community and spread Imix's influence over it.

The Servant stat block depicts a half-elf. It's a Level 6 Skirmisher with the
Leader tag and 73 HP. Their ground speed is 6 and they have low-light vision.

Servants try to always keep moving in order to benefit from their **Wildfire
Stride** passive trait: if they move at least 3 squares, their attacks deal +5
fire damage for a turn.

They wield **scimitars** that can performa a standard basic attack and an
**Immolating Strike**, which is a bit weaker but deals ongoing 5 fire damage
(save ends). The basic strike itself is also kinda weak - it's the Wildfire
Stride damage bonus that brings it to the expected level of damage.

Their "leaderly" skill is the **Gift of Fire** (recharge 5+), a minor action
that gives every ally within 5 squares a +5 fire damage bonus that lasts for a
turn.
