## The Lore

Zeburon is the fearsome leader of the Black Sands Raiders, a brutal and feared
bandit gang that hides out in the Black Sands. According to rumor they always
number a hundred, and ride war-trained kanks to assault caravans and settlements
around the Black Sands.

Zeburon himself has this name because of his signature fully-enclosed metal
helmet, which has narrow slits, some decorative runic etching, and a pair of
prominent horns. Not even most of the Raiders have ever seen his face - only his
most trusted lieutenants (such as the defiler Fevik) know what he looks like.

And this is because Zeburon's big secret is that he's a tiefling. The book lists
reasons why no one has figured it out yet, and they're actually a little
funny. He lacks a tail because he cut it off himself years ago. People tend to
mistake the reddish tone of his skin for sunburns instead of natural
pigmentation. And they think the horns are part of the helmet, when in fact
they're poking through a pair of holes in it.

Zeburon hides his true nature from the rank and file of his gang because he's
afraid of how they'd react if they found out. Given bigotry is never in short
supply around Athas, I'm guessing the answer is "not well". And being a fearsome
individual warrior is not very helpful if ninety guys on war kanks decide they
want you dead and charge you all at once.

## The Numbers

Zeburon is a Level 12 Elite Soldier with 246 HP. He has a ground speed of 6,
low-light vision, and Resist Fire 10.

All of his attacks deal bonus damage against bloodied targets due to his
**Bloody Violence** trait. He fights with a **Bastard Sword** that can make
standard basic attacks and be used in a **Wild Bloodletting** maneuver,
attacking a Close Burst 1. A hit deals damage, slows the target, and inflicts
ongoing 10 damage (save ends both). This recharges when he's first bloodied.

As a minor action he can use his **Iron Fist** (metal gauntlet!) to make another
attack, which does the same damage as the sword, and immobilizes for a turn.

Finally, he has the tiefling **Infernal Wrath** power which, when used, gives
him a bonus to attacks and damage against any enemy that hit him since the end
of his last turn. This lasts for a turn or until he hits an enemy.

## Encounters and Final Impressions

A fight against Zeburon will also include a sizable contingent of Black Sands
Raiders, as well as his best buddy and top lieutenant Fevik the Defiler. Plus
any amount of kank mounts you deem necessary.

I'm pretty sure I've seen someone a lot like Zeburon in one of the many Brom
illustrations for DS: muscles, leather straps, face-concealing horned helmet.
However, he appears to be new.
