## The Lore

The first devil we're looking at is actually a bad example of infernal
subtlety. Bearded devils, also known as Barbazus, are wrathful creatures who
love to fight. They tend to be used both by their hellish superiors and by
diabolist summoners as bodyguards and shock troops, jobs which suit them just
fine.

Bearded devils are well-armored and fight with glaives enchanted to cause
horrible bleeding wounds. Their beards are actually a mass of muscular clawed
tendrils which they can use to harass enemies. Though they have claws, they will
only use them if they somehow lose their weapons. Barbazus might be fiends but
they still have standards.

Like all devils, they're Evil and speak Supernal.

## The Numbers

Barbazus are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils), and Level 13 Soldiers with 129
HP. They have trained Perception and darkvision, as well as 20 fire
resistance. They run at speed 6.

Their basic attack is a Reach 2 glaive, which marks the target for a turn and
causes ongoing 5 damage (save ends) on a hit, in addition to what should be
level-appropriate damage. They also have a claw attack as described above, which
is just a normal physical attack that does less damage than the glaive and
doesn't mark.

When bloodied they enter a Battle Frenzy, which gives them +2 to attacks and +5
to damage. And their Devilish Teamwork gives adjacent allies a +2 bonus to AC.

Oh, and there's the beard. Its tendrils act like an Aura 1 around the devil,
dealing an automatic 5 damage to anyone who starts their turn inside.

The sample encounter is level 13, 3 barbazus and 2 yuan-ti malison sharp-eyes
(i.e., yuan-ti artillery).

## Final Impressions

There's nothing extraordinary about bearded devil lore, though I find their
looks interesting. Mechanically, they seem to be solid soldiers once you fix
their damage. They use reach weapons, so they work well in two-row formations
with more of their kind, or with brutes.
