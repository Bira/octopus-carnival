Bone devils, so called because they're all thin and spiky, occupy an
intermediate rank in Hell's hierarchy. They are fanatically loyal to their
superiors, and their main function is to keep a watchful eye on lesser devils to
make sure they're not slacking off and are displaying the proper amount of
zeal. Their approach to dealing with slackers or cowards is notoriously violent.

In other words, they're both Hell's commissars and its middle management. I
imagine that mortal villains would summon bone devils to fulfill the same
function for their own organizations, or to help wrangle a cadre of lesser
devils. They're also known as Osyluths, and are only present in the Monster
Manual.

## The Numbers

Bone Devils are Large Immortal Humanoids (devils), and Level 17 Controllers
(leaders). They're trained in Perception, have darkvision and Resist
Fire 20. They move at speed 8, and also have a teleport speed of 8, which makes
them very mobile.

I'm not sure I've covered the Leader keyword yet. It means that this
particular monster has abilities that help its buddies in the same way a PC
leader would help other PCs. This rarely includes healing, being weighted
towards granting bonuses or extra actions. Leader monsters are most often
controllers, but other roles can be leaders too.

Osyluths have two auras, both with a radius of 5 squares: the Aura of Fear gives
enemies in it a -2 to attacks, and the Aura of Obedience is basically the
Commissar Signature Move. Any bloodied ally who is not also a bone devil and who
starts their turn in this aura takes 10 damage, and gains a +4 bonus to attack
and a +5 to all damage for a turn. If the damage is enough to kill the ally,
then the bone devil regains 10 HP instead.

Their basic attack is a Reach 2 claw, and they also have a Reach 2 poison
stinger. This does the same damage as a claw attack, but also injects a poison
that does 10 ongoing damage and inflicts a -4 penalty to the target's Will (save
ends both).

Osyluths can make a Double Attack with the claw at will, and if both claws hit
the same target it can attack them with the stinger without spending an action.

As a minor action the osyluth can direct its Fiendish Focus towards a
target. This has Range 5, targets Will, and gives the target a -5 penalty to all
defenses for a turn.

An enemy force including an osyluth is probably a bit frightening to fight. If
the bone devil really focuses on a target, the victim could be looking at a
constant -5 penalty to all defenses and a -9 to will. They pair really well with
lurkers or artillery, but are kind of a double-edged sword when paired with
melee fighters. Becoming bloodied in the vincinity of an "allied" osyluth is not
conductive to long-term survival.

The sample encounter is level 16: 1 bone devil, 5 barbazus, and 1 cambion
hellfire magus who is likely the leader of the band.
