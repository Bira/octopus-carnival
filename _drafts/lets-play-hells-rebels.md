I started a Let's Read of Hell's Rebels way back when it was new, in 2017. I had
gotten the campaign's first three volumes with alongside a huge pile of other
Pathfinder PDFs in one of Humble Bundle's offerings.

I managed to publish articles about the first two of those books here, and
stalled out for a few years on the others. I will probably publish those in the
future (the D&D monster book readings did take up a lot of my time).

This post, and the series it starts, are about something a bit different. You
see, ever since I got those books I also had a desire to _run_ this campaign,
but I didn't want to do so using Pathfinder 1e's default system. No, I wanted,
and still want, to use the Dungeon Fantasy RPG for it.

I actually tried to do it! This was during the thick of the pandemic here in
Brazil, so I did it on Roll20 with a group of friends. We did the entire first
adventure, and most of the second too - just about to the spot where I stopped
publishing the Let's Read, in fact. I ended up stopping that campaign because
the combined workload became a bit too heavy for me. I had to convert everything
on the fly, prepare battle maps and tokens for Roll20, adjudicate setting
developments in response to PC actions, and do all of that on time for the next
session in two weeks while juggling all the other stress sources those
interesting times produced for me and my family.
