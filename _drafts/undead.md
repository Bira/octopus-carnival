In Gransys, the word "undead" applies to those walking corpses more commonly
known as _zombies_ in other media, but here we use it in the more traditional
Dungeon Fantasy sense to encompass all sorts of horrors from the grave.

Undead in Gransys are generally similar to those found in countless other
fantasy settings. They are common in old burial sites related to the pagan
religion that predominated in the region before the Faith asserted itself. They
also infest any place that's seen a great deal of death, like old battlefields -
often the only indication that war was fought at a given site are the undead
that roam it. This also means that the most dangerous dungeons are teeming with
these monsters, who find it easy to replenish their ranks using unwary
adventurers.

## Zombies

There's little to say about the zombies of Gransys that hasn't been said a
thousand times elsewhere. They're slow, they moan a lot, they come in large
numbers and they like holding you down and biting you to death. The Horde
Zombies from **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy** should do nicely to represent the bulk of
them. Of note is that Gransys zombies are usually _not_ infectious. They rise
because of necromancy or a divine curse, not a plague. Of course, an industrious
coven of necromancers could still get a zombie infestation going by doing all
the animating themselves.

## Skeletons

Common skeletons are little more than faster, more fragile zombies, but they get
interesting rather quickly. Like zombies, they don't keep any of the original
person's memories or personality, but they do often retain their skills!
Skeletons that rise from old battlefields tend to be skilled soldiers. Old
temples and mage towers will often contain skeleton _wizards_. None of them can
improve on these skills after death, but if a 400-point delver falls in the
depths of a death-tainted dungeon, they're likely to become one of its most
terrible monsters. Nothing else of the old person remains - skeletons have no
personality to speak of and desire only to slay the living.
