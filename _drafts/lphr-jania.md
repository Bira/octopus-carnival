Jania is a distinguished alumna of Lady Docur's School for Girls. She moved to
Vyre to seek her fortune after graduation, and took to the city's fashions
("goth") and customs ("creepy") quite readily. Both made it very easy for a
skilled thief to ply her trade.

Jania soon acquired a certain propensity for grandstanding. She built an
above-board reputation as a powerful wizard and an "openly secret" one as a
master thief for that extra thrill. It helps that creepy, unexplained events
keep happening around her. Jania introduces herself as "The Great and Powerful",
though some think a better title would be "The Two-Faced". Don't call her that
where she can hear you, though, she considers it insulting.

Ms. Moonshadow's increasing boldness soon caused her to run afoul of an old
wererat named Hei-Fen, a veteran of the same business who was enjoying a "quiet"
retirement as the combat instructor for an assassin cult. After the first couple
attempts on her life, Jania decided that it would be wise to go on vacation for
a while. She regrettably had to leave most of her ill-gotten gains behind.

When she returned to her old hometown of Kintargo, she found it in quite a
state. Lady Docur filled her in on the local situation and asked for some help,
which she was only too happy to provide. Jania feels a genuine need to repay the
school for her excellent education, and she also sincerely hopes that hag
Hei-Fen dies of old age before Jania has to return to Vyre.

## Notes

I had found a picture that worked very well for how I imagined Jania to look,
but it turns out its author doesn't want their images reposted elsewhere, so
there's no illustration here. Imagine her how you like.

Jania's personality has a lot of The Great and Powerful Trixie in it, with a
dash of Lupin III and a tiny bit of Sucy thrown in. She puts up a flamboyantly
witchy front in social interactions and is all about being extremely sneaky when
practicing her actual craft of thievery. She even likes using classic "phantom
thief" moves like leaving calling cards or giving advance warning of a heist,
but only when it helps her plans succeed.

Rules-wise she's built on a tweaked version of the Spell-Thief template from
GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Denizens: Thieves. She has Spell-Thief Expertise, which
adds to spells just like Magery but also benefits her Spell-Thief
abilities. Jania's main focus is being the party's sneak and its "active
radar". She can fight well when compared to a civilian but she's far from being
the best combatant in this party.

For progression, our highest priority here is getting Jania a third level of
Spell-Thief Expertise, which will raise all of her spell levels to the discount
breakpoint of 15. After that point we can either keep adding more spells, or
improving her thief and combat traits. Danger Sense might be a good purchase
here. She should also get something expensive to act as a Power Item.
