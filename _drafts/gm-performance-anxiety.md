My feelings on "Old School" roleplaying are mixed, but I think there's one
aspect of it I would love to bring back into vogue. Or rather, something I would
like to "banish" from contemporary gaming in order to bring the two closer
together.

I'm talking about the Elminster Problem, of course, only nowadays it's a whole
lot bigger than Elminster. D&D is just lousy with high-powered NPCs and villains
who are at best only appropriate as campaign end bosses and at worst forever
beyond the reach of any PC.

This is something that's been in my mind forever, of course,
