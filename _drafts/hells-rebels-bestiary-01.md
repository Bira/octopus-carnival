I've been posting a lot about D&D 4th Edition monsters in this blog, which does
mean the volume of GURPS posts has gone down a little. To make up for that I
decided to post some GURPS monsters too! In this article I'm going to write full
stats for the monsters that appear in [Part 1 of Adventure 1 of Hell's
Rebels][1]. The original Let's Read post only included vague conversion notes,
so this one will have the full writeups. It will also be added to the [project
page][2] alongside the article it covers.

## Preliminary Considerations

Before we start producing stat blocks, we need to look at some of the original
system's assumptions.

## Diabolical Resistances

D&D fiends, of which devils are a subtype, are famous for having a complex and
arbitrary set of resistances. Different editions of that game have implemented
it in different forms. The ones that seem most appropriate for our purposes are
the sets from Pathfinder 2nd Edition and D&D 4th Edition.

I prefer the first one because it's slightly more complex, while still being
simpler than the nonsensical 3rd edition set. PF2 devils are immune to fire and
highly resistant to poison. They are resistant to attacks from non-silver
weapons, and take extra damage from good-aligned weapons. A weapon with one of
these traits will deal normal damage to it. A weapon with both will deal bonus
damage. A damaging spell will deal normal damage as long as it doesn't use fire
or poison.

That's the paragraph we want to translate to GURPS. And this is how I'd do it.

**Infernal Resistance**: This combines Immunity to Fire; Immunity to Poison;
Injury Reduction 2 (non-silver weapons) and Vulnerability (x2, Holy weapons).

The PF2 description also perfectly describes what goes on here. Silver-coated
weapons do count for overcoming infernal resistance! Credit for the Injury
Reduction/Vulnerability pair goes to Douglas Cole in his Hall of Judgment
adventure.

### What makes a Holy weapon?

There are several things that can make a weapon holy enough to pierce Infernal
Resistance:

- The Holy enchantment (**DF Magic Items 1**, p. 6).

- The Affect Spirits spell, cast by someone with Power Investiture (Holy).

- The Holy Weapon spell, which we're introducing now. It's a clerical spell that
  requires Power Investiture (Holy) 3 and has all the same parameters as Flaming
  Weapon except it adds bonus Holy damage and doesn't start fires.

- Any weapon wielded by someone with the Holy Weapon power-up (Pyramid #3/61,
  p. 9).

## Monsters By Scene

### Aria Park Protest

These are the forces of "Law and Order" present at the Aria Park protest, who
will engage the PCs and everyone else present as soon as things turn rowdy.

To recap what the book says: four CCG thugs will engage the PCs immediately,
shortly followed by two dottari. The biggest complicating factor here is the
huge civilian crowd that's busy panicking and dealing with many other scuffles
against other thugs and dottari.

Should the PCs mop these up quickly, feel free to throw some more thugs and
dottari in or to have Nox's squad charge in early.

By the book, Nox and her reinforcements charge any PCs who haven't escaped by
D&D round 7 (which is around 42 seconds after the fight starts): twelve dottari,
plus Nox herself and her pet hell-hound. Escaping this death squad is
automatic - the book expects Nox and Mephiry to be the final bosses of the
adventure.

#### Chelish Citizen's Group Thug

The CCG is technically a civilian association and is not on the direct employ of
Thrune, but its members are always looking for opportunities to show their
loyalty via the repeated application of a club to the head of anyone who
dislikes the government. Feel free to describe them as draping themselves in the
colors of the Chelish flag, shaving their heads, wearing red caps, or any other
markers you need to get the point across that these are fascist scum.

Threat level: Fodder. These schlubs with clubs can be taken out by any solid
hit. Even if they survive, their morale will break and they will run away.

**ST** 11; **DX** 10; **IQ** 9; **HT** 10

**HP** 11; **Will** 9; **Per** 9; **FP** 10

**Speed** 5.00; **Move** 5.

**SM** 0; **Dodge** 8; **Parry** 9 (club); **DR** 1;


- **Club** (10): 1d+1 cr. Often done as a Telegraphic Attack for +4 to
  hit, +2 to enemy defenses.
- **Brawling Punch (10)**: 1d cr; Reach C.
- **Wrestling Grab (10)**: 1d+1 control (1d-1 one-handed); Reach C.

**Traits**: Bully; Fanaticism (Thrune);

**Class**: Mundane.

**Equipment**: Light cloth armor, club, 2dx$5 in coin.

#### Dottari Guard

The dottari are Kintargo's official police force. They're better trained and
equipped than the CCG thugs, but the force's selection process ensures they have
around the same level of fanatical loyalty and brutality. All dottari are
bastards.

An individual dottari is no match for a combat-focused delver, but they're never
encountered alone.

Threat level: Worthy. Built using the Guard template from DF15.

**ST** 13; **DX** 11; **IQ** 10; **HT** 12;

**Dodge** 8 (10); **Parry** 9U (11U) (mace); **Block** 9 (11);

**DR** 3/2.

**HP** 15; **Will** 10; **Per** 10; **FP** 12;

**Speed** 6.00; **Move** 4; **SM** 0.

- **Mace (13)**: 2d+2 cr; Reach 1.
- **Shield Bash (12)**: 1d cr; Reach 1.
- **Short Bow (13)**: 1d imp; Acc 1; Range 150/225.

**Traits**: Bully; Callous; Duty (Thrune);

**Equipment**: Light scale armor, mace, medium shield (DB 2), short bow, quiver
with 12 arrows, manacles. Medium Encumbrance.

#### Lemure

The diabolist's equivalent to the necromancer's basic zombies, this putrid blob
of flesh is pretty much mindless. It's similar to the zombie on DF: Monsters
p. 62, but it attacks with Sharp Claws for cutting damage and has Injury
Tolerance 2 against everything except attacks from Holy or silver weapons.

### Mephiry the Hellhound

Hellhounds are statted up in DF: Monsters, but I'm making my own slightly
beefier version based on that one, plus the Hound from DF5, and my guidelines
from [this post][3].

If you're starting out with a point total lower than 250 for the PCs, or if you
want Mephiry to be less challenging, feel free to use the official hell hound
stat block.

**ST** 13; **DX** 14; **IQ** 6; **HT** 14;

**Dodge** 11; **DR** 5 (15 vs. Fire); **SM** 0;

**Speed** 7; **Move** 8/12;

- **Bite (16)**: 1d+1 cutting plus 1d+1 control; 1d burning follow-up; Reach C.
- **Claw (16)**: 1d+1 crushing.
- **Fire Breath (14)**: Costs 1 FP to use; 2d burning; Ranged with 1/D 5, Max
  10, but treat as a melee attack similar to a jet spell.

**Traits**: Dependency (Mana); Immunity to Poisons and Disease; Quadruped.

### Nox

One of Barzilai's named lieutenants, Nox is a human who sold her soul to Hell in
exchange for power in life. This gives her regeneration comparable to that of a
troll (except against Good spells or abilities), and limited ability to teleport
and to summon a lemure. She's also a master of the glaive on top of that.

The first confrontation between Nox and the PCs is meant to convince them to
run, as the book expects her to be the adventure's final boss when the group has
reached level 3 and acquired some magic items. Brave delvers could try to take
her and her retinue here at the protest, though, so her stats are included here.
