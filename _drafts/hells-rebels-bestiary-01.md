I've been posting a lot about D&D 4th Edition monsters in this blog, which does
mean the volume of GURPS posts has gone down a little. To make up for that I
decided to post some GURPS monsters too! In this article I'm going to write full
stats for the monsters that appear in [Part 1 of Adventure 1 of Hell's
Rebels][1]. The original Let's Read post only included vague conversion notes,
so this one will have the full writeups. It will also be added to the [project
page][2] alongside the article it covers.

## Aria Park Protest

These are the forces of "Law and Order" present at the Aria Park protest, who
will engage the PCs and everyone else present as soon as things turn rowdy.

To recap what the book says: four CCG thugs will engage the PCs immediately,
shortly followed by two dottari. The biggest complicating factor here is the
huge civilian crowd that's busy panicking and dealing with many other scuffles
against other thugs and dottari.

Should the PCs mop these up quickly, feel free to throw some more thugs and
dottari in or to have Nox's squad charge in early.

By the book, Nox and her reinforcements charge any PCs who haven't escaped by
D&D round 7 (which is around 42 seconds after the fight starts): twelve dottari,
plus Nox herself and her pet hell-hound. Escaping this death squad is
automatic - the book expects Nox and Mephiry to be the final bosses of the
adventure.

### Chelish Citizen's Group Thug

The CCG is technically a civilian association and is not on the direct employ of
Thrune, but its members are always looking for opportunities to show their
loyalty via the repeated application of a mace to the head of anyone who
dislikes the government. Feel free to describe them as wearing brown shirts,
having shaved heads, or any other markers you need to get the point across.

Threat level: Fodder. Your typical CCG thug will run away as soon as he's
wounded.

**ST** 13; **DX** 11; **IQ** 9; **HT** 12;

**Dodge** 7; **Parry** 9U (small mace); **DR** 2;

**HP** 12; **Will** 9; **Per** 9; **FP** 11;

**Speed** 6.00; **Move** 4; **SM** 0.

- **Small Mace** (13): 2d+1 cr; Reach 1.
- **Brawling Punch (13)**: 1d cr; Reach C.
- **Wrestling Grab (13)**: 1d+1 control (1d-1 one-handed); Reach C.

**Traits**: Bully; Fanaticism (Thrune);

**Class**: Mundane.

**Equipment**: Heavy cloth armor, small mace, manacles, 2dx$5 in coin. Light
Encumbrance.

### Dottari Guard

The dottari are Kintargo's official police force. They're better trained and
equipped than the CCG thugs, but the force's selection process ensures they have
around the same level of fanatical loyalty and casual brutality.

Threat level: Worthy.

**ST** 15; **DX** 13; **IQ** 10; **HT** 12;

**Dodge** 10 (12); **Parry** 11U (13U) (mace); **Block** 11 (13);

**Speed** 6.25; **Move** 4; **SM** 0.

- **Mace (15)**: 2d+4 cr; Reach 1.
- **Shield Bash (15)**: 1d+1 cr; Reach 1.
- **Short Bow (13)**: 1d+1 imp; Acc 1; Range 150/225.

**Traits**: Bully; Callous; Duty (Thrune);

**Equipment**: Scale armor, mace, medium shield (DB 2), short bow, quiver with
12 arrows, manacles. Light Encumbrance.

### Mephiry the Hellhound

Hellhounds are statted up in DF: Monsters, but I'm making my own slightly
beefier version based on that one, plus the Hound from DF5, and my guidelines
from [this post][3].

**ST** 13; **DX** 14; **IQ** 6; **HT** 14;

**Dodge** 11; **DR** 5 (15 vs. Fire); **SM** 0;

**Speed** 7; **Move** 8/12;

- **Bite (16)**: 1d+1 cutting plus 1d+1 control; 1d burning follow-up; Reach C.
- **Claw (16)**: 1d+1 crushing.
- **Fire Breath (14)**: Costs 1 FP to use; 2d burning; Ranged with 1/D 5, Max
  10, but treat as a melee attack similar to a jet spell.

**Traits**: Dependency (Mana); Immunity to Poisons and Disease; Quadruped.
