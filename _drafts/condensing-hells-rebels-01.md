If you're familiar with Pathfinder adventure paths, you probably know they tend
to have quite a bit of padding to them. This is because they're designed to take
the group from level 1 to a set maximum level, and they closely adhere to the
game's XP system while doing so.

This means that these adventures must make their PCs go through a certain amount
of _stuff_ that rewards the prescribed amount of XP. Some of that stuff is
quests, as in "award the group this much XP for completing this goal", but most
of it is going to be fights.

That can result in a lot of filler! There's one famous example in the Iron Gods
adventure path where its whole third volume (out of six) is basically a wild
goose chase that could have been completely ommitted by placing its McGuffin at
the end of the dungeon on volume 2, where it originally was.

I've seen blog posts in the past "condensing" these adventure paths by removing
all the filler and making them as direct as possible. This is very useful when
you're running them in a different system like GURPS Dungeon Fantasy, where
characters start out powerful and don't necessarily gain XP from fights. It's
also excellent when you're using the native system with milestone advancement
instead of a XP tally. That way you just advance the PCs to the proper level at
the right times, so it doesn't matter if you take the filler out.

In this post, I'll try to do this with with the first volume of Hell's Rebels,
the one with the ridiculous title of "In Hell's Bright Shadow".

## Part 1

In [Part 1 of the adventure][1] everything from the initial scene at the Aria
Park protest to the talk with Rexus Victocora at the Long Roads Coffeehouse
should remain as-is. These scenes open the adventure with a bang and set the
early stakes of the campaign.

We can tweak the events that follow this meeting for maximum story progression
speed.

- Rexus and Laria bring the PCs under their confidence immediately, telling them
  about the potential hideout under the coffee house and about its tengu
  situation.

- The situation with the tengu sisters is different. Chough does not
  exist. Mr. Smuggler Buddy instead left saying he would return soon, and never
  came back. Laria knows the sisters are down there and has been keeping them
  fed, but they need Smuggler Buddy to leave town. Some legwork by the PCs will
  reveal that he's been captured by Thrune loyalists.

- The old Silver Ravens hideout is under the **Salix Salt Works**, which is
  being used as a forced labor camp just like in the original. The hired thugs
  in control of it don't know about the hideout, plus it's an excellent starting
  point to look for Smuggler Buddy. He is indeed here, which is awfully
  convenient but is fast.

- The grimples in the old hideout are not evil and will not act with immediate
  hostility towards the PCs. They will grant safe passage through their
  territory in exchange for the PCs dealing with the "terrible demons" in the
  other half of the dungeon. The lemures in question should be a very easy fight
  after the salt works. Alternatively, the underground level is just empty apart
  from Blosodriette, and the PCs can recover the loot here unopposed.

- Blosodriette hitches a ride like in the original. If you don't want to deal
  with her extended sabotage later on, you can ensure the PCs find her here,
  which will cause her to immediately try to bargain with or kill the PCs. This
  early detection might even happen by itself if the party has PCs with
  abilities like Detect (Evil), Detect (Demons) or spells like See
  Invisible.

## Part 2

This would be the [sandboxy part of the adventure][2] after the PCs recover the
Silver Raven cache. We've already rolled some of its assorted encounters into a
single storyline in Part 1. I'm only going to keep one of them: **Crackdown at
Clenchjaw's**, which nets the PCs an awesome fairy dragon ally if they play
things right.

I'm also going to reach into Adventure 02 and pull in the **Temple Hill
Slasher** storyline to replace the _other_ murder mystery that used to be
here. Have the Slasher also target tieflings. DF PCs should be able to take care
of him directly and it should provide the "combined" reputation boost from both
mysteries. This is what gets the Silver Raven name back into the city's rumor
mill.

They can work both of these cases while growing the rebellion in the strategic
layer and possibly dealing with Blosodriette's sabotage in between.

## Part 3

Just before Rexus deciphers the Silver Raven documents, the PCs receive an
invitation for a meeting with Lady Mialari Docur, who originally only appeared
in Adventure 03. She's an acquaintance of Laria's here, and makes the same offer
of alliance she makes there. From this point on she provides her bonuses and
acts as the "face" of Kintargo's black market. If the PCs need illegal gear,
they can go to her for it.

After Rexus deciphers the documents, a process the PCs can help speed up, we go
into **Hocus' Phantasmagorium** as the [big capstone delve][3] of the
volume. This remains mostly as-is.

## Conclusion

As I mentioned back in [part 1 of the Let's Read][1], I'm in favor of using
250-point delvers to start with, but scaling the challenges as if they were for
lower-powered PCs. So the expectation here is that the PCs breeze through these
early scenes and get their rebellion on a steep upward trajectory as soon as
possible. Our heroes have absolutely no need of filler encounters here, so I'm
keeping only the ones that add something directly to the
rebellion. Theoretically they would be already strong enough to raid the
Phantasmagorium from the start.

If you can manage to make your fights move at a good clip, I estimate this would
take about 5-6 sessions to run through. A single session for Part 1, 1 or 2 for
part 2, and the rest for part 3 since it's a bigger dungeon crawl.
