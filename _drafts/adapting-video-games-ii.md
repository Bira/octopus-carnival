One of my first posts here on Octopus Carnival was on [Adapting Videogames][1],
written as I was about to embark in my [GURPS Dragon's Dogma][2] project. In it
outlined my preferred approach to doing just that: taking the setting of a
videogame[^1] and turning it into the setting for a tabletop RPG campaign.

This post is meant to provide more detail on how I approach a particular aspect
of that effort, which I only mentioned briefly on the original: how I deal with
games that are part of a franchise. The motivation for it came from a discussion
in the Facebook comments for the announcement I made for my [One-Post Skyrim][3]
post

Games that are part of the same franchise often share a setting, and have
plots that connect to each other. Even when they don't[^2], they still share
significant thematic elements, and sometimes a few iconic "props" as well.

When adapting a videogame franchise's setting to the tabletop one might be
tempted to look at the whole thing as a single work, but I don't think that's a
good approach. It's those pesky gameplay mechanics again, you see. Unless two
games in the same franchise reuse most of the same code[^3], they'll be as
different from each other as two editions of the same tabletop system. At a
minimum.

As I said in my [original article][1], I believe trying to copy the videogame's
mechanics verbatim in the "destination" system is a losing proposition. This is
particularly true when you have several sets of different and often times
contradictory game mechanics. When I set out to do something like this, I begin
by looking not to each individual set of mechanics, but at what changes and what
remains the same between them, and what the games in question. The stuff that
stays the same is usually important; the stuff that changes is usually not, but
the direction in which these changes happen can be.

Let's look at the Elder Scrolls franchise, for example. There are only three
mechanical things that really stay consistent from game to game there:

- The core gameplay loop: create a character, wander the land, receive and
  perform quests.
- Quest structure: an optional main quest that doesn't end the game, and a large
  number of sidequests, which can be partially or entirely built through
  procedural generation.
- The list of playable races (mostly).

Pretty much _everything else_ changes to one degree or another. The overall
system is very AD&D-like in Arena, and over the next games it morphs into
something more flexible. Character classes and racial adjustments become less
important, skills gain more prominence while becoming more coarse-grained, magic
gets simpler and more common in character builds.

Having this picture in my head helps me a lot with writing the actual
adaptation. I know I need to pay special attention to the "immutable" bits, and
that it's okay not to sweat over the stuff that changes often. But most
importantly I have an idea of what it's all supposed to _feel_ like, and can
tailor the end result to get that same feeling.

This is the central idea in this whole process: it's all about feelings! The end
goal is a tabletop setting that _feels_ like part of the original franchise, not
one that replicates every tiny implementation detail of every one of its games.

While I may only have talked about Skyrim in my [last post][3], I believe the
thematic elements I discussed there would apply to any Elder Scrolls
adaptation. For the same reason I would use the standard GURPS Magic system for
the setting, because it has the same _high-level_ characteristics as the magic
system in most games of the franchise. You have a large number of spells; each
spell has a narrowly-defined effect; it's relatively easy for someone to learn a
few basic spells but being a Real Wizard takes dedication.
