I had never heard of direguards before, but some quick googling tells me they
first appeared in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting for AD&D 2nd Edition.

## The Lore

A direguard is a skeletal undead created by a specific ritual often known by
liches and death knights. The ritual requires willing subjects, who retain their
minds, combat skills, and powers. This comes at a price, however: in the book's
own words, they must "meet a quota of killing", or they'll be destroyed. I don't
know if this is a one time thing or if it's more like "kill X people every
month". And of course they're bound to the will of their creator.

Their FR lore is all tangled up with the whole Bane/Cyric situation.

## The Numbers

Direguards are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Undead keyword. They have
darkvision and truesight 10, and are immune to disease and poison. The rest of
their traits varies per stat block.

### Direguard Deathbringer

Deathbringers are Level 8 Elite Artillery with the Leader keyword and 134
HP. They have a ground speed of 7 and project a **Command Aura** (4) that grants
a +2 attack bonus to all allies inside. They can also issue a **Vile Command**
(close blast 3; recharge 5-6) that allows all affected allies to shift 2 squares
and make a basic attack as a free action.

They fire **Force Blasts** (Ranged 15 vs. Reflex) that do force damage and push
the target 3 squares. On a miss, they do no damage but slow the target for a
turn. **Frightful Force** (recharge 4-6) allows them to fire three such blasts
against different targets in a single action.

If forced into melee, the deathbringer's **Blazing Bone Claws** do force damage
as well. And when they're first bloodied, they summon some **Force Armor**
around themselves that grants a +4 bonus to AC and Reflex until they're hit by
an attack.

I'd say deathbringers are at home just behind the front line, or further back
along with a cluster of artillery enemies with ranged basic attacks.

### Direguard Assassin

Assassins are Level 11 Skirmishers with 111 HP. They're made of shadow as much
as they are made of bone, and fight with swords made of force magic. Their
ground speed is 8.

That **Force Blade** deals force damage, as expected, and once per encounter
they can fling **Dire Blades** to do the same amount of damage in a Close
Burst 1. **Mobile Assault** gives them a +2 attack bonus if they move at least 4
squares before attacking, and **Mist Walk** allows them to shift 2 squares and
gain Insubstantial and Phasing for a turn when missed by a melee attack.

## Final Impressions

There are no sample encounters here! I guess they could only spare one page for
direguards, so there was no room.

I don't care for the FR bits of their lore, but Deathbringers work nicely as
commanders of mindless undead, and Assassins are good elite troops for someone
like a skull lord to order around.
