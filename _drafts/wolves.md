    Wolves hunt in packs!

    - Every pawn, ever.


This post is part of a series converting Dragon's Dogma enemies to **GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy**. Please go [here][1] for links to all other posts in the
series.

The [goblins][2] we saw in the last post might be annoying, but they're not as
annoying as the wolves of Gransys. Their agile, darting fighting style makes
them a chore to fight at all power levels.
