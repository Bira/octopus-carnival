Chitines feel like a late-3e addition to the game, and likely had slightly
different lore back then.

## The Lore

Chitines are an artificially engineered people. The first of their kind were
produced in drow laboratories in an attempt to create the perfect slaves. The
techniques and materials user were a mixture of arcane magic, prayers to Lolth
and both souls and genetic material from elves, spiders, and demons.

It did not work out. Soon after the first batch of chitines was created, _Lolth
herself_ intervened to grant them freedom and allow them to strike back at their
would-be enslavers. This makes a lot more sense once you remember Lolth doesn't
really like or trust her worshippers, as we discussed in the [Yochlol][2] entry.

Lolth's intervention caused a special priestly caste of chitines, known as
Choldriths, to emerge from the vats and lead their people to freedom. In our
narrative present, chitines inhabit the upper Underdark and believe themselves
to be the true chosen of Lolth. The relationship between their two peoples can
be summed up as "kill on sight", though chitines are more willing to negotiate
with non-drow peoples and trade their service as mercenaries in exchange for
money, weapons and magic.

Most chitines are devout Lolth worshippers to the same extent drow are, though
each people considers the other's faith heretical. Chitines believe they, and
not the drow, are Lolth's favorites, and that her true form is that of a spider
rather than that of a drow.

The creation of the chitines is a relatively recent event, so they lack much
experience with surface. They know it exists, but haven't really explored it and
tend to see it as a source of baffling mysteries. The book mentions a story
about a shifter illusionist that managed to convince a chitine settlement that
she was an aspect of Lolth, and used them to attack a nearby drow settlement and
assassinate a rival.

There's an interesting side box here about how chitines build their lairs. The
basic structure here is a **suspended fortress**, a tear-shaped web sack hanging
from the ceiling that's large enough to contain two or three floors of
chambers. Larger settlements have several of these linked by walkways. You can
use this style to build chitine-themed dungeons.

## The Monsters

Chitines are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Spider keyword. They have
Darkvision, and a Spider Climb speed equal to their ground speed (usually
6). Most of them prefer daggers for combat, with specialists using other
weapons.

Their signature power is a **Web Line** (move action, encounter), which can be
used when they're climbing and allows them to fly 5 squares. Everything else
comes from training.

### Chitine Grunt

Chitines don't really have the concept of a "non-combatant". When their lairs
are attacked, every individual inside grabs a knife or four and rushes to its
defense. The vast majority of them are going to use this stat block.

Grunts are Level 5 Minion Brutes. They wield four **daggers** which can be used
for melee or ranged basic attacks. When killed they emit a **Dying Shriek** that
inflicts a -2 penalty to the defenses of all adjacent enemies for a turn. This
is an untyped penalty, so I _think_ it might stack. I'm not sure, though.

### Chitine Warrior

These chitines have a combination of extra training and experience that makes
them a much greater threat in combat. They're Level 5 Brutes with 72 HP. They
carry _eight_ daggers, four in hand and four ready to replace any thrown
blades. Like their minion counterparts, they can use **daggers** for melee and
ranged basic attacks, and they can also make a **Four Blade Strike** that
consists of four slightly weaker dagger attacks.

They're pretty much a non-minion version of the Grunt, and they never step on
the actual floor of the map unless they can't help it, attacking instead from
the ceiling and walls.

### Chitine Scounts

Scouts patrol and defend the approaches to a chitine cave, using rapid-firing
hand crossbows to attack from unexpected angles. They're Level 5 Artillery with
48 HP.

Their melee basic attack is still a **dagger**, but those **hand crossbows**
have a lot more range than a thrown knife. Using the **Furious Volley** ability,
they can make up to two dagger and two crossbow attacks with a single
action. Once per encounter they can fire a **Poisoned Bolt** that targets
Fortitude, does the same damage as a regular attack and inflicts 10 ongoing
poison damage. That's a lot for level 5!

### Chitine Marauders

Chitine custom says that any offspring beyond the first eight in a clutch must
be cast out to fend for themselves in the Underdark. If these outcasts manage to
survive a year out there, they're welcomed back. Most who survive don't bother
trying to return, and instead form their own outcast communities.

Marauders are Level 6 Skirmishers with 72 HP. They're armed with paired **short
swords**, and can make two attacks per action with them. They deal extra damage
if they have combat advantage.
