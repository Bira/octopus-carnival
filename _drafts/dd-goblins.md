    We eats when we wants and sleeps when we're tired of eating!

    - Goblin Motto

This post is part of a series converting Dragon's Dogma enemies to **GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy**. Please go [here][1] for links to all other posts in the
series.

In the [last post][2] we saw that Gransys has a serious bandit problem, but it's
not nearly as bad as its _goblin_ problem. A lone goblin is not much of a threat
to anyone trained in fighting, but they're never alone! The danger posed by a
force of goblins grows out of proportion to their individual might, as they
quickly organize themselves under the leadership of "goblin kings".

Despite this, they don't have anything resembling a complex culture: there's no
goblin language, and "goblin art" is almost an oxymoron. Goblins live in
mountain caves and obtain most of their complex tools by stealing them from
humans. A goblin king is simply a goblin who's smarter or stronger than usual
and who manages to browbeat a group of his fellows into obeying. Capable enough
monarchs soon find themselves in command of a small army, and might manage to
even enslave larger monsters such as cyclopes. Much of the Duke's strategy with
those centrally-controlled border fortresses aims to protect Gransys from goblin
raids originating in the mountain chains west of the duchy.

Smaller groups are everywhere within Gransys, operating like more chaotic
bandits. Despite their common interests, goblins and human bandits don't get
along well - goblins are just as happy to attack _them_ as they are to attack
civilians.

## Goblin

Your average goblin is a small humanoid with reddish skin, pointy ears and
teeth, and cat-like eyes. They're rarely more than about five feet tall, and
their intellect is nothing to write home about. They use improvised or scavenged
weapons.

### Racial Template (-51 points)

**Attribute Modifiers**: IQ-2 {-40}; HT+1 {10}.

**Secondary Characteristic Modifiers**: SM -1; Basic Move -1 {-5}

**Advantages**: Infravision {10}; Resistant to Metabolic Hazards +3 {10};
Teeth (Sharp) {1}; Giant Weapons 1 {1}.

**Disadvantages**: Appearance Ugly {-8}; Bully (12) {-10}; Cowardice (12) {-10};
Laziness {-10};

### Goblin Rabble

These are typical representatives of the goblin stereotype. They live in caves
or crude camps and love to rob and torment passing travelers. One of them is
still a credible threat to an unarmed civilian, and they always come in large
numbers.

**ST** 10; **DX** 11; **IQ** 8; **HT** 11

**SM** -1; **Dodge** 8; **Parry** 9U (light mace); **DR** 0;

**HP** 10; **Will** 8; **Per** 8; **FP** 11

**Basic Speed** 5.5; **Move** 5.

- **Cheap Small Mace (12)**: 1d+2 cr.
- **Punch (10)**: 1d-3 cr.
- **Grapple (10)**: Uses Wrestling.

**Traits**: As per the Goblin racial template.

**Class**: Mundane.

**Equipment**: Cheap small mace, rags.

## Hobgoblin

These are much bigger and stronger than normal goblins. It's unknown whether
they are a separate species or not, but a group of them can often be found
bossing smaller goblins around. Hobgoblins are more sophisticated than their
smaller, lazier cousins: they can make their own equipment and are more skilled
and disciplined in combat. Despite this, individuals aren't all that smarter
than normal goblins.

### Racial Template (-6 points)

**Attribute Modifiers**: ST+2 {20}, IQ-2 {-40}; HT+1 {10}

**Secondary Characteristic Modifiers**: Will+2 {10}; Per +2 {10}

**Advantages**: Infravision {10}; Resistant to Metabolic Hazards +3 {10}; Teeth
(Fangs) {2}

**Disadvantages**: Appearance Ugly {-8}; Bully (12) {-10}; Bloodlust (12) {-10};
Sadism {-10};

### Hobgoblin Grunt

The hobgoblin rank and file are more enthusiastic about fighting than common
goblins. They roam in small bands, sometimes with an accompanying gaggle of
goblins. They use swords, shields and mail armor of hobgoblin make. Their
overall behavior is more in line with that of human bandits than common goblins,
but they consider human bandits to be prey like any other human.

**ST** 14; **DX** 11; **IQ** 8; **HT** 13

**SM** 0; **Dodge** 9 (10); **Parry** 10 (11) (sword); **Block** 10 (11); **DR**
4/2*.

**HP** 14; **Will** 10; **Per** 10; **FP** 13;

**Basic Speed** 6; **Move** 6.

- **Cheap Thrusting Broadsword (14)**: 2d+1 cut or 1d+2 imp.
- **Shield Bash (14)**: 1d cr.
- **Grapple (14)**: Uses Wrestling. Effective ST 16.

**Class**: Mundane.

**Traits**: As per Hobgoblin racial template.

**Equipment**: Cheap thrusting broadsword, mail armor, small shield.

## Variants

Not all goblins are average! The sample enemies given above are the equivalent
of humans built with the 62-point templates in **GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 15:
Henchmen**. Exceptional individuals built with the Brute, Skirmisher or Killer
125-point templates and one of the racial templates above are relatively
common, and the variations below may also be found.

### Goblin King

This is a remarkably intelligent member of the species, able to forge the usual
goblin rabble into a more efficient fighting force. Raise IQ by 2+, add one or
more levels of Born War Leader and the skills covered by that talent. The
smarter and more talented the king, the larger the force they can command!
Really strong kings might be built with the Knight template from **DF 1**.

### Goblin Mage

Some exceptional goblins delve into the arcane arts rather than contenting
themselves with brute force. Minor shamans with IQ 11, Magery 1 and around 10
spells are as likely to lead small goblin bands as a king. More powerful
examples exist as part of larger communities or deep in the mountains. Build
them with the Apprentice or Wizard templates.

### Grimgoblins

These terrible creatures hint at the true origin of goblins. They look like an
albino version of normal goblins or hobgoblins, but are much more dangerous than
either! Most people have never seen one, and think they are a myth. The coming
of the Dragon will make them see their error.

Build a normal goblin or hobgoblin first, using any of the templates and
variations above. Change Class to _Demon_. Raise ST by 5, DX and HT by 2, combat
skills by 2 or more. Change Resistant to Metabolic Hazards to Immunity to
Metabolic Hazards. Grim Kings and Mages are proportionally smarter and more
dangerous as well.
