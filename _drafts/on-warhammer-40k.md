When I announced my post on [Meltaguns][1] on the GURPS Discord server, the
following sentence from there generated a little discussion:

    There is pretty much no reason to use one of these instead of a
    good anti-vehicle missile, but the Imperium of Man never cared for reason.

Some of the people who were in there at the time disagreed with this
sentence. They made reasoned arguments to explain their position[^1], and while
I still don't agree with them, I could kinda see where they're coming from.

At the core of that logic is a strong impulse to suspend disbelief in the
setting. To look at the stuff depicted in the setting material and wargame
rules, and to build a chain of logic that makes it internally consistent. This
is an attitude shared by a lot of fans of the setting, and some of its writers
too.

I come at this from a different direction. At the core of my thinking about
Warhammer 40.000 is the fact that this setting is _utterly ridiculous_, and any
material I write will hold that idea within its heart. The Imperium's equipment
and entire military strategy are designed around what would make the best heavy
metal album covers. So are almost everyone else's.

I will gladly adapt stuff from that setting to GURPS, and I would even GM a game
in that setting, but in both cases I will always keep that ridiculousness in
mind and lampshade it at every opportunity.

[^1]: Basically, that the setting's missiles are weaker than meltaguns because
    that's what the wargame and FFG rules imply.
