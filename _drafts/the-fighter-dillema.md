Ah, the Fighter. A D&D class with a rather troubled history as D&D classes
go. In almost every edition of the system it's subject to a somewhat thorny
dillema that I will attempt to describe here.

What is a Fighter? Someone who fights! Yeah, yeah, it seems obvious from the
name. However, that definition has actually changed a bit as new editions
followed older ones, and that is in part where the dillema comes from.

From Original (AKA Old) D&D through the whole BECMI alphabet soup and up until
about AD&D 1st Edition, "someone who fights" was a pretty accurate
description. The Fighter was pretty much _the_ physical combat class, and was
meant to represent any sort of physical combatant at all. This being D&D,
greater emphasis was given to armored European-style knights, but changing that
was just a matter of refluffing some gear and making different equipment
choices.

When 3rd Edition rolled around, the dillema really began. Anyone who is familiar
with 3.x or its cousin Pathfinder knows of the myriad mechanical problems faced
by martial characters in general, but Fighters in particular also begin to
suffer from _conceptual erosion_. This is evident even from the base classes in
the Player's Handbook, but it gets worse as first- and third-party supplements
start to come out. Now you have many combat-centered classes, each of them
fighting in a very specific way, and each representing something the Fighter _no
longer does_.

I mean, you theoretically could make a Three Musketeers style swashbuckler by
taking a high-Dex fighter with Weapon Finesse and the proper gear choices, but
why do that when there's a Swashbuckler class with all sorts of built-in
abilities a fighter could never buy as feats? Want guns? Use a Gunslinger. Want
archery? There's the Ranger, and if you don't like the naturey bits I'm sure
there's a specialized Archer class in some third-party supplement. Want a
katana-trenchcoat-and-mirrorshades Matrix refugee? I'm sure there's a whole base
class for that too.
