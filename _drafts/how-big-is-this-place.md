In [previous][big-picture] [posts][adventuring] I mentioned that the map of
Gransys is "truncated", in that it has less settlements than the story says it
should. We'll take a look at why that is today. We'll use [this map][map-link]
as a reference in this article. Be warned that it's a fully annotated map, so it
contains spoilers for the console game! We'll also touch on certain story
elements that can be equally spoilery.

These two settlements are the isolated fishing town of Cassardis, and the
cosmopolitan capital of Gran Soren. These are the only two places where you can
find normal civilians going about their daily lives. There are a few castles
near the edges of the map, but they contain only soldiers or monsters.

The reason for all this is simple: there are only so many resources to go around
when developing a video game, both in terms of time and money and in terms of
memory, storage and processing power. Thus, every place in the game fulfills a
very specific purpose. They're either dungeons, quest sites, or the bare minimum
of "wilderness" necessary to give you the feeling that you're traveling in a
fantasy world.

This applies to the two settlements as well. Cassardis is there to be your
character's hometown and an early "adventuring hub" with some basic shops and a
cheap inn. Its isolation justifies your character's ignorance about the wider
setting. Its presence makes Gransys feel more like a kingdom, because we
don't think of kingdoms as having only one city.

Gran Soren is there to be the real adventuring hub of the game, with the rest of
the game's real shops and a more expensive inn that will still feel affordable
by the time you get there. It's also the stage of all of the game's "urban"
story segments, conveniently housing all the scheming nobles, corrupt merchants,
and shady villains you'll ever need to meet.
