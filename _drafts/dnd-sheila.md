Sheila is Bobby's older sister, a shy and gentle girl who is terribly afraid of
being alone. She's also quite smart and often points out flaws in the other's
plans. They listen to her a lot more often than they listen to Eric.

Dungeon Master calls her "the Thief" because her invisibility cloak alows her to
hide and sneak easily, but she rarely steals anything. Her skill at stealth
increases over time. Sheila is 13 at the start of the show.

Our version of Sheila is a 62-point character using the Novice Fast Delver
template as a base.

## The Cloak of Invisibility

This hooded cloak makes the wearer invisible when they pull the hood up, and
visible again when they pull it down. Both are Ready actions. This works even
better than the spell of the same name: it doesn't end when the user attacks,
the usual magical counter-measures are ineffective, and requires no Fatigue to
maintain.

All of the usual mundane tricks for detecting someone invisible still work, such
as relying on other senses or environmental cues. This means Blind Fighting does
work. This invisibility also stops of the hood is somehow pulled down or knocked
off the wearer's head.

This cloak could make a traditional stabby rogue into an unfathomable nightmare,
but Sheila abhors violence so she uses it mostly to sneak around.
