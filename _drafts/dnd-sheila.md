Sheila is Bobby's older sister, a shy and gentle girl who is terribly afraid of
being alone. She's also quite smart and often points out flaws in the other's
plans, who listen to her a lot more often than they listen to Eric.

Dungeon Master calls her "the Thief" because her invisibility cloak alows her to
hide and sneak easily, but she rarely steals anything. Her own stealth skills
increase as the show goes on. Sheila is 13 at the start of the show.

Our version of Sheila is a 62-point character using the Novice Fast Delver
template as a base.
