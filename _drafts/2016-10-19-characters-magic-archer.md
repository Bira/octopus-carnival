title: "Dragon's Dogma: The Magic Archer"
category: gurps
---

As promised, here is the first of the two entirely new templates related to
Dragon's Dogma. The Magic Archer is meant to combine the archery prowess of a
Scout with the magic of the Wizard in a more balanced way than what is possible
by using "multiclass" lenses.

## The Magic Archer (250 points)

You blend two tricky disciplines into an elegant, pointy whole. You're almost as
good a shot as any Scout (**DF 1**, p. 10), but you chose to spend the rest of
your time learning the secrets of magic rather than getting lost in the
woods. You trade the Scout's skill at wilderness survival for the ability to
deliver magical explosions at greater distances than the Wizard (**DF 1**,
p. 15).

### Magic Archers in Gransys

Magic Archers are relatively rare in Gransys, as it takes a lot of work to get
this good with both a bow and magic. Noble scions are the ones most likely to
have the necessary time on their hands, though anyone who makes a living
fighting could also acquire the necessary training during their careers. This
includes both knights and bandits!

## New Spell

### Arrow of Mercy (Special)

This works exactly like Spell-Archery, except it creates a ghostly projectile
that does no damage and imbues it with the energy of another _beneficial_ spell
you know that could be cast by touch. It has Spell-Archery as a prerequisite,
and works just like it in all other ways.



[^1]: Multiplied by self-control number; see p. B120.
[^2]: Includes +3 from Magery.
