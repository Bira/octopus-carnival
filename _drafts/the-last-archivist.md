Urist is a dwarf cleric, and that's something you might be able to tell just
from looking at him. Stocky build, big beard, wears armor and weapons as if they
were everyday clothing, has a prominently displayed holy symbol attached to that
armor.

He does deviate from the stereotype in several ways which are not immediately
obvious, though. He pays homage not to the usual dwarven gods, but to deities of
luck and protectors of fools like Avandra and Cayden Cailean. His personality
tends a lot more towards the jolly than the gruff, though you usually have to
get to know him a bit to see that.

Another thing about Urist that's not immediately obvious is that he was a member
of the Sacred Order of Archivists, a secret society that was dedicated to
gathering and protecting the kind of knowledge House Thrune wanted to destroy or
redact. Most of these were historical documents, though they also stored a lot
of books on magic and dangerous artifacts that shouldn't fall into the hands of
diabolists. He was an active participant in those efforts and was often sent on
missions to recover more documents and artifacts.

He happened to be out in one of those missions both when Barzilai Thrune first
infiltrated the Order, and when he later sent a small army to raid and ransack
its hideout. He's the last remaining full member, and they don't know who he
is. Luck does indeed favor the fool.

Urist is not just going to lie low, however. He knows two of his dead colleagues
had a son who escaped the horrible events of the Night of Ashes. He's going to
start by tracking that boy down, and then he'll see if they can do something
about this asshole in power. He maintains his jolly demeanor but beneath that is
a core of good dwarven steel ready to split some fascist heads.

## Notes

My initial plan called for the Last Archivist to be a much more serious
Ezio-like figure, but the "quick delver" templates that seemed appropriate for
that didn't feel like they were good fits for the Order. I later thought of a
better party layout and so the spot opened up for a properly brainy delver. I
always did want to play a good old-fashioned Urist-type dwarf, though this one
does have some details that make him more than a cliche.

"Störtebeker" is the name of a real medieval pirate, according to [this
video][1] about a Lancer mech that also has that name. It's Low German for "the
guy who can empty an entire mug in one go", which definitely fits a priest of
the god of lucky drunks.

Urist here is mostly a typical DF dwarf cleric, with his choice of deity
informing his personal disadvantages as seen below. For progression, while more
spells and Power Investiture are always good, he's also set up to begin dipping
into the Holy Warrior template, since he already starts with several classic
paladin abilities like Unfazeable and Detect Evil. Improve his DX and ST, add
some Higher Purpose (Slay Demons), perhaps some of the "boost" blessings, and
we're home. His starting spells and powers do have a bit of that "player read a
walkthrough before starting" theme to them, as they are all useful for Hell's
Rebels.
