"You can write FORTRAN in any language", the joke goes.

FORTRAN (short for "formula translation") is the very first high level
programming language. Before its invention in 1954, people programmed computers
by writing raw machine code or by rewiring the hardware directly.

Since it was the first high level language, FORTRAN lacked many of the
convenience features we take for granted in contemporary programming
languages. It was still easier to write than raw assembly, but not by a
lot[^1].

Some started making this joke because people who started out programming FORTRAN
would move on to other languages but they'd still write their code using the
same idioms they did when writing FORTRAN. Their code would read like a FORTRAN
program, and it'd ignore many of features and conveniences its actual language
had. This would result in programs full of easily-preventable bugs.

The principle behind the joke applies to a lot of other technologies in the
world of programming. For a number of years at the start of the 21st century,
people used XML for _everything_.

Some companies used this phenomenom to their advantage: one of the early selling
points of Microsoft's C# language was that it was extremely similar to Java and
so Java programmers could easily switch to it.

## The Joke Works On Gaming Too

D&D is kind of the FORTRAN of RPGs. It's the first RPG, or at least the first
one to be codified as such. It's received updates up to the present day. It's a
fine system when used for its intended purpose.

And you can play D&D in any system.

This is not about rules, mind you. It's about assumptions, both about the basic
format of the game itself and what PCs are expected to do in the campaign. I
guess it's a bit harder for me to put that into words more specific than the
FORTRAN joke, but I'm sure a lot of GMs reading this have experienced something
similar.

Like, I have some friends who are into Ars Magica and who even do quite a bit of
historical research when they want to start a campaign. But every campaign of
theirs I witnessed was played like D&D With An All-Wizard Party. No ensemble
cast, no passage of seasons, no lab work. No covenant, really, other than as a
synonym for "the party of PC wizards".


I wonder how much of that is down to the fact that D&D bills itself as a fantasy
game. That's a bit misleading, and it's the reason why I love that Steve Jackson
games came up with the term _Dungeon Fantasy_ for the kind of fantasy D&D
is. Not every game is like that[^2]!

The FORTRAN joke goes beyond genre, too. There are plenty of finer-grained
details that are very much D&D-isms but tend to be considered core tropes of the
fantasy genre instead. The split between "arcane" and "divine" magic, and even
the split between "warriors" and "wizards", are quirks of how old D&D classes
worked and could very well be invalid in your game. Maybe every practitioner of
magic is also a kind of priest[^3], or maybe knowledge of magic is so widespread
the idea of a specialized "spellcaster" profession would be like that of a
professional "air-breather".

[^1]: Modern FORTRAN did gain many of these conveniences and remains a fine
    language when used for its intended purpose.

[^2]: Shadowrun, however, is definitely a dungeon fantasy game with cyberpunk
    trappings.

[^3]: And this is actually more "realistic" than what D&D does.
