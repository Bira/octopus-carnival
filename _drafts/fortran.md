"You can write FORTRAN in any language", the joke goes.

FORTRAN (short for "formula translation") is the very first high level
programming language. Before its invention in 1954, people programmed computers
by entering bits of assembly or machine code by hand, or by rewiring the
hardware directly.

FORTRAN is still in use today! The language and its tools have been updated
throughout the decades, and it's still a popular language for scientific
computing. It's a fine language when used for its intended purposes.

But what does the joke mean? Since it was the first high level language, FORTRAN
lacked many of the stuff we take for granted in contemporary programming
languages. It was still easier than raw assembly, but not by a lot. It would get
some of those things in future versions, but when the joke was made up it still
didn't have them.

Some started making this joke because people who started out programming FORTRAN
would move on to other, newer languages, but they'd still write their code using
the same idioms they did when writing FORTRAN. Their code would read like a
FORTRAN program, and it'd ignore a lot of the quality-of-life features the newer
language had. This would often give rise to bugs of the sort you wouldn't
normally expect to see in that kind of program.

The principle behind the joke applies to a lot of other technologies in the
world of programming. For a number of years at the start of the 21st century,
people used XML for _everything_. Some companies used this phenomenom to their
advantage: one of the early selling points of Microsoft's C# language was that
it was very easy for Java programmers to learn.

## The Joke Works On Gaming Too

D&D is kind of the FORTRAN of RPGs. It's the first RPG, or at least the first
one to be codified as such. It's received updates up to the present day. It's a
fine system when used for its intended purpose.

And you can play D&D in any system.

This is not about rules, mind you. It's about assumptions, both about the basic
format of the game itself and what PCs are expected to do in the campaign. I
guess it's a bit harder for me to put that into words more specific than the
FORTRAN joke, but I'm sure a lot of GMs reading this have experienced something
similar.

Like, I have some friends who are into Ars Magica. They sometimes try to get a
game going. The usual GM in these games is a very patient and learned individual
who builds detailed campaign locations based on well-researched bits of history
blended with region- and time-appropriate folklore.

And then the usual players go into those detailed locations to play D&D With An
All-Wizard Party. Troupe play is a faint afterthought - the wizard is the "real
PC". The passage of seasons is something I've never seen happen in the sessions
I witnessed or heard about, which were all spent in a very zoomed-in "adventure
mode", which usually includes plenty of combat.

This intensifies when you have someone other than the usual GM at the helm, with
covenant-less campaigns where the mission is to establish a covenant in the
first place. The party is all wizards, who have only their starting knowledge
and a few personal possessions. And "establishing a covenant" usually means
going into a series of holes in the ground to fight monsters and loot
treasure. One of these games ended because Ars Magica healing spells worked
differently from those of D&D, and they realized they didn't have and couldn't
get the resources to heal a wounded wizard PC permanently.

A lot of these friends were also part of my "real-time" groups, and I remember
that one of them in particular had a lot of trouble getting out of the D&D
mindset. I GMed a game that was _mostly_ D&D-like but had a few more abstracted
strategic parts, and he was unable to "zoom out" to the strategic layer when it
came up. In a Lancer game I tried GMing, I started with a surreal sequence where
the players were actually playing a few "bad guy" characters. They used the same
numbers as their PCs for familiarity reasons, but this same player had a real
hard time understanding that he _wasn't_ playing his PC.

And of course we can't forget the Star Wars fan who believes that every Star
Wars RPG adaptation, for any system, must have a system of Force Powers that
mirrors the one in Star Wars d20 as closely as possible.

Like FORTRAN veterans who continue to write FORTRAN in other languages, these
players were still very much in a traditional D&D mindset when engaging with
other systems.
