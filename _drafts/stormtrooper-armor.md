Do you know what is the second hardest thing to convert when adapting Star Wars
to the tabletop? Stormtroopers[^1]. From an in-character perspective, facing
down a squad of stormtroopers is a terrifying perspective. Of course, we _are_
in a heroic action story, so what actually happens is that troopers almost never
hit a shot and always get taken out in one hit from even the most primitive of
weapons.

Their poor aim has actually made it into GURPS as an optional cinematic rule
named "Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy", which reduces the deadliness
of enemy shooters. But what about their armor?. Why does it do nothing? Armor
effectiveness is usually framed as a matter of pure physics, so it feels like
you can't just explain its ineffectiveness here as a skill issue.

There are almost as many attempted solutions to this as there are Star Wars
adaptations. Me, I think I hit on a solution that allows me to keep those fun
fights while still having armor be cool. Ir might not work for you, but it works
for me.


## Imperial Stormtrooper Armor Drills

This is a cinematic rule meant for science fiction settings where highly
effective armor is common, but you want the PCs to have fun battles against
armies of heavily-armored mooks. Star Wars and stormtroopers are the most
obvious examples, but it also works for any setting featuring heavily-armored
mooks, like Warframe with its Grineer soldiers.

Under this rule, armor worn by "mook" or "fodder" enemies has no protective
value, and is mostly a cosmetic detail! Any solid hit will take them out as
usual, regardless of whether it would have penetrated their DR under standard
rules. Armor worn by PCs and other important characters still uses all the
default rules.

This allows you to frame a particularly badass trooper as a real threat simply
by declaring they're not a mook, without having to give them different
gear[^2]. It also allows PCs to loot armor from a fallen mook and have it
actually provide benefit beyond a temporary disguise.

[^1]: The first is the Force, but we all know that.
[^2]: The Force Awakens does this a few times.
