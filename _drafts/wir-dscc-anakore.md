I have no idea if anakores appeared before. This is the first time I've read
about them.

## The Lore

Little is known about the origins of these creatures. Ancient tales speak of a
terror from beyond the sky that touched their humanoid ancestors, causing them
to recoil from the sun and seek shelter underground. Over time, these ancestors
became today's anakores.

Anakores live in small hunter-gatherer bands led by their most accomplished
tracker. They burrow beneath the desert sands during the day, and from there
they can feel the vibrations of prey passing overhead, and smell blood spilled
on the ground. When anakores detect prey, they can follow it all day by
tunneling through the sands, waiting until nightfall to spring their ambush from
below. Then they will fight with their powerful digging claws and their
paralytic bites.

While on the move, the creatures subsist on plant roots, including certain
poisonous species that help the formation of their venom. Rootless vegetation is
spread around an area is a possible signt of anakore presence, though they're
often intelligent enough to clean this up if they intend to stay in place for a
while.

Different band members specialize in different parts of an attack - some lead
the ambush, others strike to hurt and incapacitate victims, and yet others drago
those victims underground.

I guess a lot of the time they prey on the local fauna, but anakores don't mind
attacking sapient travellers, and judging from what the book says seem to prefer
it. They don't have any visible sexual dimorphism, and rumor has it that they
reproduce by dragging some of their sapient victims to weird cocoons under the
sands. There, the victims are transformed into more anakores. No one knows what
criteria they use to select new candidates.

## The Numbers

Anakores are Medium Aberrant Humanoids, which means they're sapient. They have
low-light vision and Tremorsense 5, plus a ground speed of 5 with Earth Walk and
a burrow speed of 6 on loose earth only. They communicate in Deep Speech.

Their signature traits are **Dune Diver**, which lets them charge while
burrowing, and **Sensitive to Light**, which gives them a -2 penalty to attacks
for a turn when they're exposed to direct sunlight or take radiant damage.

Their poison is a rider on a different attack on every stat block, but the
effect is always the same: the target is slowed on a hit (save ends), worsening
to immobilized (save ends) after the first failed save.

### Anakore Hunter

These are the ones who drag people under. They're Level 5 Lurkers with 48
HP. Their basic **claw** attacks grab the target on a hit, and on their next
turn they can choose to either bite the victim or drag them under.

The **bite** targets a grabbed creature and deals a bit less damage than the
claws, but applies the poison described above. **Drag Under** (melee 1
vs. Fortitude) can target either immobilized or grabbed creatures. It deals more
damage than the claw, inflicts 5 ongoing damage and removes the target from play
(save ends both). When the effect ends the target reappears at its previous
position or on the closest unoccupied square. And even them they're still
immobilized (save ends), so the hunter can try to drag them under again right
away instead of having to bite.

Presumably, victims who drop to 0 HP by this attack would be dragged further
down and not come back up. Don't let that happen!

### Anakore Render

This is the one that hurts the prey and makes it more vulnerable to the
others. Renders are Level 7 Brutes with 96 HP and a ground speed of 7 instead
of the usual 5.

Their **claws** do heavy damage on a hit, pushing the target 2 squares and
knocking it prone. Their **blood frenzy** ablity (recharge 5+) lets them perform
two of these attacks in one action.

As a move action, they can use **Blood Hunger** to shift 3 squares closer to a
bloodied creature. As a minor action, they can use a **rending bite** against a
prone or bloodied creature, which does light physical damage and applies anakore
venom.

### Anakore Dune King

Often the leaders of a pack, Dune Kings signal the start of an attack by bursting
up from the ground in the middle of their targets and distracting them so their
fellows can attack the victims more safely. They're Level 9 Skirmishers with 94
HP and the Leader tag.

Their **claws** damage and apply anakore poison on a hit, but the real threat
here is the **Sand Eruption** ability (recharge 5+). The dune king must be
underground to start this, and the action lets him move 4 squares to a square
that's not underground. The first time they enter such a square, they can
perform a Close Burst 2 attack that targets enemies and deals very heavy
physical damage on a hit, sliding the targets 2 squares. Additionally, each
anakore in the burst can shift 3 squares as a free action, and the area of the
burst becomes difficult terrain until the end of the encounter.

Finally, Dune Kings can shift 1 square as a minor action using **Sand Slide**,
which makes them as slippery as kobolds despite their size.

## Encounters and Final Impressions

Anakore bands only hunt in places where they can burrow, which means the terrain
on the map will mostly be soft earth, sand, or silt. An anakore-only encounter
is the most common one, I think, but they can also appear with other burrowing
predators that they either trained, or which happen to be opportunistically
hanging around.

They can also work with other sapients that pay them in food and trinkets for
doing what they were already going to do anyway, and you might also find them
in bizarre aberrant ruins on or under the surface, drawn there by strange dreams
and performing unspeakable rituals.

Anakores are smart enough to recognize when they're in a poor situation, and
when they should negotiate instead of fight. But if they think they should
fight, their underground ambushes can be pretty terrifying, as all of their
powers synergize very well and make the tactics described in the lore section
very effective.

Their burrow speed lets them go back underground at will, meaning each Dune King
might be able to perform more than one Sand Eruption in a fight, and the Hunters
can move with relative impunity among the party to harass and grab the
PCs. Renders stay up top once they emerge, and all of them are immune to the
difficult terrain created by the Kings due to Earth Walk.
