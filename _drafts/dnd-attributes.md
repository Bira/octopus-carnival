Nearly every person who plays role-playing games can tell stories about their
first D&D edition. Mine was that version of Basic that came in a box with rules
for advancing characters up to level 5, and I've been through several
others. And in all of them, something has always bothered me about the way the
game handles attributes.

In most of them, that was the randomness. The "real" old school attitude would
be to create whatever character you could with the numbers the dice gave you,
and consider yourself lucky if you rolled high. If you rolled poorly, it was no
biggie - you would most likely be making a new character soon enough.

I never really saw things that way. I tended to come up with detailed character
concepts before rolling the dice, which obviously left me disappointed when the
resulting numbers failed to live up to the cool image in my
head[^1]. Furthermore, those atribute bonuses seemed so vital that instead of
feeling lucky when I rolled a 16 or higher, I felt unlucky when I _didn't_. In
AD&D, not getting percentile strength as a fighter felt like a waste of
time. Needless to say, I also found that the high chance of dying at level 1 was
quite anti-climatic.

Apparently I wasn't the only one who felt this way. D&D Third Edition made it
easier for players to roll high attributes by switching the default generation
mode to 4d6-drop-lowest-assign-as-desired, and also gave players the option to
forgo random generation altogether and instead buy attributes with
points. Fourth Edition went even further by making the non-random method the
default one, something which I believe remains true in Fifth. Fourth also got
rid of random hit points entirely, which suited me just fine.

This did make things a lot less annoying for me. It's one of the reasons D&D 4
remains my favorite edition. Nevertheless, there are still some things about
attributes that bother me a little. With every passing edition, it seems they
grow more important. At least one 16+ score went from only _feeling_ mandatory
for a decent character to being actually _expected_ by the math.

[^1]: I was doing Storyteller-style character generation before it was cool.
