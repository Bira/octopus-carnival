The woman in front of me was clearly some kind of noble. She did a good job of
hiding it, but you simply can't get skin that smooth without having magic woven
into every strand of your DNA. I was about to deal with a capital-L Lady.

"I believe my family is cursed," she said, not bothering to hide the accent now
that she was in my office.

I paused. Nobles and curses are both things that demand extra caution,
especially when they're encountered together. I needed to know more. "M'lady,
you look like someone who can afford the best experts around. Why choose me?"

"None of them could help me, Detective. Your unconventional approach might
succeed where theirs did not."

Breaking a curse is simple when you have the kind of mojo the big shots swing
around. A detection spell to find it, a nullifier spell to erase it, and you're
done. State of the art nullifiers can take care of any malediction modern
magical theory can cook up.

If you can't afford the magic, the alternative is to use old-fashioned
investigation and research to figure out the particulars of the curse and break
it the way it's supposed to be broken. An outdated and inefficent approach, the
province of crackpots. My province.

The Lady could afford proper wizards, yet here she was. I could also see the
first hints of worry begin to show through the careful calm of her expression,
so I spoke.

"Okay, M'lady, you got my interest. Let's hear the details of your case."
