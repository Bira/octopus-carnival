I remember seeing Gricks for the first time in 3.0, but I wouldn't be surprised
if they appear earlier than that. In this edition they're only on the MM.

## The Lore

In the previous post about Grells I complained that a lone grell was
indistinguishable from any of the many other tentacled underground
predators. Well, Gricks are one of those, and the main sources of
confusion. They even have tentacles, a beak, and a short name that starts with
GR.

The main differences are that gricks are nonsapient and have worm-like bodies
instead of being floating brains. They live in caves and in the upper reaches of
the Underdark. There's pretty much no chance for the PCs to have a nonviolent
interaction with these beasts (aside from sneaking around them, I guess). Gricks
are always either hungry and hunting, or hanging around their nests, which they
protect with murderous intensity.

I note they don't seem to have a burrowing speed, so they either need to stick
to premade caves and tunnels, or they burrow too slowly to make a difference in
combat. When food turns scarce in the grick's preferred environment, they'll
venture out to the surface to hunt at night, returning home before sunrise to
avoid burning out their tiny cave-adapted eyes.

Gricks are pack hunters and have excellent instincts for surrounding their
intended prey. They're also really tough and hard to hurt. I wonder if bullettes
and gricks prety on each other, like sperm whales and giant squid.

## The Numbers

We get two stat blocks here.

### Grick

The default model is a Medium Aberrant Beast and a Level 7 Brute with 96 HP. It
has Resist 5 against all effects that target AC, moves with speed 6, and climbs
with speed 4. It also has darkvision.

Its basic attack is a Tentacle Rake (Melee 1 vs. AC) that does both immediate
and ongoing damage on a hit (save ends).

It also has a trait named Expert Flanker that grants it a +2 attack bonus
against a target it's flanking. That does stack with the standard +2 from combat
advantage, for a total of +4.

### Grick Alpha

A bigger, badder version leading a pack. It's a Large Aberrant Beast and a Level
9 Brute (Leader) with 116 HP. It has the same damage resistance, senses, and
climb speed as the base grick, but its ground speed is 7.

The tentacle rake attack is almost identical, but has Reach 2 and also grabs the
target. The alpha can then use its standard actions to perform a Vicious Bite on
the grabbed target, doing automatic damage that's a bit weaker than that of the
tentacles.

Why would it bother with that? Because it grants its allies a +2 attack bonus
against the grabbed victim. So while being chewed on by the alpha, the hapless
PC will also be attacked by the smaller gricks with a total bonus of +6: 2 from
CA, 2 from Expert Flanker, and 2 from this ability.

Of course, the alpha is an Expert Flanker itself.

## Sample Encounters

Gricks obviously don't socialize with anyone outside their packs, but sometimes
an opportunistic predator will join a grick fight hoping to score some
scraps. They can also be enslaved by certain aberrant creatures, which seem to
be the only ones that can make any use out of these ornery worms.

Thus we get our two sample encounters:

- Level 8: 1 grick alpha, 3 standard gricks, 2 dire stirges.

- Level 9: 2 alphas, 1 gibbering mouther, and a trio of foulspawn.

## Final Impressions

I like their mechanics, but the lore doesn't inspire me all that much. A nice
incidental encounter for "natural cave" dungeons, I suppose.
