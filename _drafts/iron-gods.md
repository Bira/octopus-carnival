There's a very important reason for the increasing delay between my [Let's Read
Hell's Rebels][1] posts: for the past few months I've been GMing the Iron Gods
adventure path as a Dungeon Fantasy campaign.

It all started, ironically, when a friend of mine invited a bunch of people to
start a D&D 5th Edition game. He had just acquired a copy of Tales From the
Yawning Portal, the book that adapts a lot of older adventures to 5th edition,
and wanted to make a casual campaign out of it. I accepted because I liked the
idea of participating in a game as a _player_ for once and I didn't actively
dislike vanilla D&D 5th.

This was a weekly game, taking place over Google Hangouts every Sunday
morning. It went relatively well for a while. We plowed through Sunless Cidatel
and much of Forge of Fury in pure dungeon-crawl mode. One day, though, it
happened that only the GM, me, and another player managed to make it into the
session, and we found out the hard way how essential numbers are in this edition
of D&D.

A fight that should have been something of a speedbump to a party of 4-5 turned
into a nearly fatal encounter for a duo, and so we became convinced that it was
pointless to make a go at any of the actual set-piece encounters in front of us.

So I ended up proposing an alternate game for when we didn't have a full party
for D&D. I had just acquired both the Dungeon Fantasy RPG boxed set and the
original Ravenloft module for AD&D, so I proposed a game of DFRPG Ravenloft.

I figured DFRPG delvers would be strong enough to make some progress even when
we had a reduced party, and I had a handy list of [GURPSified Pathfinder
Iconics][2] for them to pick from so that was character creation taken care of.

Pretty much the whole D&D party picked their DFRPG characters - we had Valeros
the Fighter, Harsk the Ranger, Kyra the Cleric, Ezren the Wizard, and Seelah the
Paladin. The week after that, I GMed the introductory session following the
guidelines in the module, and went all-out in roleplaying it and narrating
things.

They _loved it_. It seems at least one of the players was genuinely
scared. I'm not bragging about my own skills - rather, I'm saying OG Ravenloft
is _that_ good.

There was never an officially announced decision or anything, but our little
"D&D" group never played another D&D session after that. The backup GURPS
Ravenloft game became our main event.

So where does Iron Gods come into this story? I'll get there in a minute! First
I need to tell you how Castle Ravenloft defeated the players.

We were about 10 sessions in, and I don't think the group actually realized how
close they were to winning. They had both a cleric and a paladin. They had found
both the Icon of Ravenloft and the Sun Blade. All they had to do was meet Strahd
and kick his undead ass. They actually walked right up to the door of his throne
room! And then they gave up and ran away.

It was almost entirely a psychological defeat. The place was scary and unknown,
the random encounters hard, and they spent the first couple of sessions treating
it like a Diablo dungeon ("run in as fast as possible and kill everything that
moves!"). After that, they became overly cautious, retreating to the chapel
every couple of fights to spend the night and let those healing penalties fade.

They'd inevitably wake up to a random encounter. No, undead can't enter the
chapel, but those two rust monsters I rolled up that one time sure could! They
didn't wreck any equipment, but they scared the players just the same.

This became the usual pattern of our sessions, and if it kept up the group would
end up allowing the monsters to slowly grind them to death. I
