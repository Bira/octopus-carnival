Howlers totally feel like a 3e monster, probably because of the art. I suppose
they might have shown up in AD&D too, it's not like the game was ever shy about
adding one more dog monster to the pile.

## The Lore

Howlers are spiky, sapient quadrupedal predators that feed on fear. They've
evolved to hunt in a way that's as terrifying as possible. Younger howlers are
quick to kill because they enjoy the spike of fear the victim feels when it
dies, but older specimens are sophisticated enough to hold whole villages
hostage with the _threat_ of death-by-howler and feed off the ambient terror.

The most legendary howler of all is known as Terror Incarnate. This creature
managed to devour the fear felt by an entire army as it died, and this excess
power turned it into something like a demigod of terror. Its eventual progeny
inherited its powers.

There's some fuzzy edges in their lore. It mentions howlers attacking people in
the middle world and in the Underdark, mentions associations with shadar-kai,
but gives the creature an Elemental origin. I think they might fit better as
either Natural or Shadow. Fortunately origin doesn't influence stats.

## The Numbers

As mentioned above, Howlers are Elemental Magical Beasts. They have Darkvision
and a Speed of 8. They understand Abyssal but can't speak.

### Howler Dread Hound

One of those young specimens that kills too quickly. They gather in huge packs
to massacre whole villages at once.
