Torm, the Loyal Fury, seems to be your typical "paladinic" god of justice and
honor. His warpriests pursue justice in an unjust world and act with honor
towards those who have none. His domain is by far the most recommended for the
other FR gods, being applicable to any god who has a militant or compassionate
bent, from Bahamut to Ilmater.

## Mechanics

Warpriests of Torm are pretty much Wisdom-based warlords. Their riders boost
ally attacks and defenses or allow quick repositioning, in much the same way the
different warlord powers do. The optimization forums say this is probably the
most varied domain around in terms of what it lets you do - it's hard to get
bored playing a warpriest of Torm.

One thing that jumped out to me is their Level 1 utility power, which they get
to keep throughout their whole careers: **True Strike**! This is an _at-will_
power that lets them spend a Standard action to grant a +4 bonus to an ally's
next attack. It's not quite as fun as the Lazy-Lord's signature ability, but
it's the closest you can get to it in an Essentials-only campaign. It's also
super-useful for setting up big attacks with encounter or daily powers.

## Impressions

Just as in FR, this power set could fit a lot of different deities. The lore's
focus on justice make it a good fit for Bahamut and Moradin, and the tactical
nature of its powers could allow it to stand in for the domains of non-Good
"strategist" gods like the unaligned Erathis or the evil Bane.

That's it for domains. Next we'll look at a full class, the infamous
bladesinger.
