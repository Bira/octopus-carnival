In GURPS, the Trained by a Master advantage allows a character to perform
martial feats on par with those seen in kung fu movies and other similar
stories. The Weapon Master advantage does basically the same in a slightly
different way. They overlap so much that I'm not sure if they were meant to
exist in the same campaign!

A character with either advantage has reduced penalties for Rapid Strikes and
for multiple parries with the same limb or weapon. They also have access to
cinematic techniques and to special skills that allow them to perform
supernatural martial feats. In settings that use cinematic techniques, these
advantages also allow a character to learn these techniques for skills they
know.

A PC who is Trained by a Master enjoys increased performance when _unarmed_ or
wielding any _melee weapon_. They can learn any supernatural skill without
restriction. This costs 30 points.

A full Weapon Master PC enjoys increased performance when wielding any
_muscle-powered weapon_, which includes melee weapons, thrown weapons, and
bows. It does _not_ affect their unarmed skills. They can only learn
supernatural skills that make sense as a function of weapon use (so Power Blow
is OK, but Gecko Climb isn't). And they get a damage bonus of +2 per die[^1] for
attacks with muscle-powered weapons.

Why the difference in cost? I'm guessing it's because of the damage bonus. Using
weapons allows you to apply that bonus to your swing damage, which will almost
always have 2 or more dice for a melee-focused character, and applies on top of
whatever bonus the weapon itself already gives. The differences in skill
coverage are mostly technicalities[^2].

On its own, I think both advantages are worth their cost, but I don't think both
of them on the same character are worth 75 points. What to do if you have a
player who wants to have both? Let's look at a few alternatives.

## There Can Be Only One

One easy way to solve the issue is to say that only one of the two advantages
exists in your campaign. Which one that is depends on the specific game.

In a game where supernatural skills are meant to play a big role, where fists
are supposed to compete with weapons, or where the weapons themselves are
already pretty badass on their own, you want Trained by a Master.

A Star Wars campaign is a good example of this type of game! Several Jedi powers
can be modeled by the esoteric skills, lightsabers/force swords already do huge
damage on their own, and even non-force weapons are likely to have all sorts of
ultra-tech modifiers that add armor divisors and damage bonuses. It also fits
modern martial-arts games, where most melee fights are unarmed or involve
improvised weapons.

In a game where "martial arts master" conjures the image of someone who always
fights with a weapon, you want Weapon Master. This actually includes most
Chambara- and wuxia-style campaigns, whose iconic heroes are always armed. These
heroes might still be quite good at unarmed combat, but it's clearly secondary
to them. Such a hero will only fight completely unarmed when they're mocking a
clearly inferior opponent or, in a more serious fight, until they can get their
hands on a weapon.

In a campaign where Weapon Master is the only "mastery" advantage available, it
makes sense for it to allow its possessor to learn any supernatural skill that
exists in the campaign.

## Full Combat Mastery

If you do want both advantages to exist, I think it makes sense for PCs who have
both to get a discount on the total cost. This is really a matter of how to
price the WM damage bonus for unarmed attacks, since everything else is
practically the same.

[^1]: Technically it's +1 or +2 per die depending on skill leve, but let's face
    it, it's always going to be +2 for the weapons the PC is really interested
    in.

[^2]: Though you could argue getting that damage bonus and increased rate of
    fire on a bow is more beneficial than being able to punch faster.
