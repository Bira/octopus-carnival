In GURPS, the Trained by a Master advantage allows a character to perform
martial feats on par with those seen in kung fu movies and other similar
stories. The Weapon Master advantage does basically the same in a slightly
different way. They overlap so much that I'm not sure if they were meant to
exist in the same campaign!

For starters, they have a lot in common. A character with either advantage has
reduced penalties for Rapid Strikes and for multiple parries with the same limb
or weapon. They also have access to cinematic techniques and to special skills
that allow them to perform supernatural martial feats. In settings that use
cinematic techniques, these advantages also allow a character to learn these
techniques for skills that benefit from the advantage.

Their differences are quite fiddly. A PC who is Trained by a Master enjoys
increased performance when _unarmed_ or wielding any _melee weapon_. They can
learn any supernatural skill without restriction. This costs 30 points.

A full Weapon Master PC enjoys increased performance when wielding any
_muscle-powered weapon_, which includes melee weapons, thrown weapons, and
bows. It does _not_ affect their unarmed skills. They can only learn
supernatural skills that make sense as a function of weapon use (so Power Blow
is OK, but Gecko Climb isn't). And they get a sizable damage bonus for attacks
with muscle-powered weapons. This costs 45 points[^1].

Why the difference in cost? I'm guessing it's because of the damage bonus. Using
weapons allows you to apply that bonus to your swing damage, which will almost
always have 2 or more dice for a melee-focused character, and applies on top of
whatever bonus the weapon itself already gives. The differences in skill
coverage are mostly technicalities[^2].

I think both advantages are fairly priced on their own, but I don't think both
of them on the same character are worth 75 points. What to do if you have a
player who wants to have both? Let's look at a few alternatives.

## There Can Be Only One

One easy way to solve the issue is to say that only one of the two advantages
exists in your campaign. Which one that is depends on the specific game.

In a game where supernatural skills are meant to play a big role, where fists
are supposed to compete with weapons, or where the weapons themselves are
already pretty badass on their own, you want Trained by a Master.

A Star Wars campaign is a good example of this type of game. Several Jedi powers
can be modeled by supernatural skills, and high-TL weapons like force swords
already have big base damage and generous armor divisors. Another example are
modern action games, where most melee fights are unarmed or involve improvised
weapons.

In a game where "martial arts master" conjures the image of someone who always
fights with a weapon, you want Weapon Master. This actually includes most
Chambara- and wuxia-style campaigns, whose iconic heroes are always armed. These
heroes might still be quite good at unarmed combat, but it's secondary to skill
with a weapon. Such a hero will only fight completely unarmed when they have no
other choice, or when they're mocking a clearly inferior opponent.

A Weapon Master-only campaign might still have masters capable of broad

## Full Combat Mastery

If you do want both advantages to exist, I think it makes sense for PCs who have
both to get a discount on the total cost. This is really a matter of how to
price the WM damage bonus for unarmed attacks, since everything else is
practically the same.

My preferred solution is to say that the _combined_ cost of these two advantages
can never exceed 50 points.

[^1]: There are cheaper versions which apply the same benefits to a smaller set
    of weapons, but for the moment we're looking at the full package.

[^2]: Though you could argue getting that damage bonus and increased rate of
    fire on a bow is more beneficial than being able to punch faster.
