We're past the monster lists, but there's still a fair amount of book to
cover. Its final third is dedicated to Encounter Options, and the first
subsection of that is a small lesson on Customizing Monsters.

The gist of it is that when you want to bring a "generic" D&D monster to Athas,
you should change them a little to make them fit the more brutal and desperate
tone of the setting. In other words, you should make them Darker and Sunnier.

The next page has a few tips on how to do that. First, you should keep the
monster recognizable, since it both keeps things a little familiar and makes
the differences stand out that much more. And then you can apply one or more of
the customization guidelines they suggest, each with an example:

- **No change**: Some monsters already fit the aesthetic and could just be
  dropped in where you need them. Gnolls and bullettes, for example.

- **Altered Appearance**: Some monsters need a little extra make-up to fit the
  visual style of Athas. You'll rarely find traditional mammals here for
  example, but you could have equivalent creatures that have carapaces, scales,
  and bony plates instead of soft fur. Hill giants might look more rocky, with
  skin matching the colors of the surrounding terrain.

- **Altered Environment**: Creatures that live in frozen or aquatic biomes in
  their original forms could be changed to live in the desert wastelands of
  Athas instead. Sure, the aquatic ones could live in oases, but turning them
  into sand-burrowers can be a "nice" surprise for the players.

- **Alternative Lore**: This most important for creatures whose lore has
  extensive ties to the Astral Sea and divine magic, both of which are mostly
  inaccessible in Athas. Eidolons are one example, and they'd need to be changed
  to be tied to arcane or primal magic instead unless they're relics from when
  the gods were still around. Angels and the like should also be reskinned
  unless your entire game revolves around the mystery of why they appeared.

- **New Powers**: New mechanical abilities might be just the thing to make a
  given creature Darker and Sunnier. This should mostly be handled through
  Monster Themes, which are discussed in the next page.

## Sample Converted Monsters

These two are given as examples, and in some cases are also stealth updates to
the originals, using the new Monster Manual 3 math.

### Silt Shark

Based on the Fleshtearer Shark from the Monster Manual 2, this creature occupies
a similar niche to the bullette, with slightly different abilities. Its
water-based traits were replaced with sand-themed equivalents, and it's been
given training in Athletics to make higher jumps. It "swims" through sand and
loose soil.

The Silt Shark is a Large Natural Beast and a Level 10 Brute with 128 HP. It has
a ground speed of 5, and a burrow speed of 8, with low-light vision and
Tremorsense 10.

The original shark's Aquatic trait has been replaced with **Silt Swimmer**,
which lets the shark shift and charge while burrowing, and gives it a +2 damage
bonus while burrowing against any creature without a burrow speed. It cannot
burrow through solid stone, however.

The shark has a basic **Bite**, and a **Lockjaw Charge** maneuver that deals the
same damage and grabs on a hit. While the shark has a grabbed victim, it can
automatically deal damage to them with **Shredding Teeth**. And once the grab
ends, the victim takes ongoing 5 damage (save ends).

If the shark starts its turn within 5 squares of a bloodied creature, it enters
a **Feeding Frenzy**, and makes a free attack against a creature adjacent to
it. If it was grabbing someone, it releases them first.

### Ssurran Dune Mystic

This is a Greenscale Marsh Mystic from the Monster Manual, modified into a
Ssurran version. The swamp theme of the original's abilities has been switched
to a sand and desert theme, its Constitution was increased a little, and its
basic attack has been given a push rider to match the Ssurran Shaman from that
entry.

We end up with a Level 6 Controller (Leader) with 72 HP and a ground speed of 6
with Earth Walk. It has a **Sun Blessing** aura (5) that heals 3 HP to any ally
that stats their turn inside, and fights with a **spear** that damages and
pushes 2 squares on a hit.

The mystic also has a couple of fireball-style combat spells: **Salt Cloud**
(recharge 5+) deals poison damage and dazes for a turn; **Sand's Grasp**
(encounter) is non-damaging, but it immobilizes (save ends) and creates a zone
of difficult terrain that lasts for the rest of the encounter.

## Impressions

It's quite likely that anyone who still actively plays D&D 4th Edition is
experienced enough at reskinning monsters that they don't really need this
advice. Nevertheless, it's still good to see it printed, and with worked
examples to boot.
