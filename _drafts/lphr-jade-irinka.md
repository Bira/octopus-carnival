Jade Irinka was an orphan of uncertain but numinous parentage who was adopted as
a sort of mascot by the original Silver Ravens during their early exploits. She
was too young to go out with the Ravens on their missions, but she witnessed
their results and listened to their stories with rapt attention. Jackdaw,
knowing victory would be uncertain in the final Thrune invasion, sent her away
from the city with other non-combatant friends, hoping they would be able to
come back once the fighting was over.

Things didn't turn out well, and Jade never got the chance to return. She aged
slowly but eventually reached maturity and set out to follow on the footsteps of
her heroes. Her incredible natural charisma was soon supplemented by an almost
supernatural skill with the sword and she achieved some small measure of renown
around the Inner Sea as an heroic adventurer.

Recent news from Cheliax convinced Jade it's finally time to return home and
take up the Ravens' fight. She doesn't remember many details about those days,
but she's confident she will find a way. Everything she's done so far has been
to prepare herself for this. As the campaign starts, she has just caught up on
the events and rumors of the last few days and decides to attend the Aria Park
protest to learn more.

## Build notes

Jade's stats below are based on the Aristocrat archetype from GURPS Dungeon
Fantasy Denizens: Swashbucklers. This gives her amazing sword and leadership
skills, though I removed some of the template's more classist triats. Her being
a long-lived Celestial (AKA aasimar) is mostly a story thing for now, as I
didn't take the official racial template. She's certainly charismatic and
graceful enough to count as one, though.

Her name is taken from Chuubo's Marverlous Wish-Granting Engine, where it
belonged to the Angel of the Sun. She's also partly inspired by Princess
Celestia. I used her in Zeitgeist too, where she was an eladrin (also without a
template). Here, I'm probably going to make her related to Sarenrae somehow,
possibly literally. If you think that's too awesome for a PC, then I don't care
about what you think. You _can_ use her stats for a standard human swashbuckler
in another campaign, and those are exactly as awesome as those of any other
250-point character.

Jade's past as the Sixth Raven is also mostly a story thing, meant to provide
the "GM hat" with more story hooks by having her remember something that leads
the party to adventure. Its rules impact is in the form of her Enemies
disadvantage: most beings who remember her as a (honorary) member of the OG
Silver Ravens are demons and other long-lived monsters in service of Thrune, and
occasionally one of them will show up on its own initiative to tie up the loose
end, adding to whatever chaos is already happening as part of the campaign.

In terms of advancement, I'm hoping to spend earned points to max out her
Charisma, Born War-Leader talent, and perhaps even Appearance. She's going to be
the public face of the rebellion, after all. Holiness and its attendant powers
are also not out of the question, as they'd make her even better at fighting
demons.

If you want to make a different PC with the same theme, here's the separate
rules for it.

### Theme: The Sixth Raven

You were the "child mascot" of the original Silver Ravens, sent away to safety
before their demise. Now you're an adult who has come back home to finish their
work.

**Prerequisite**: It's been nearly 70 years since the Ravens were defeated, so
you must belong to a species long-lived enough to have been a child back then
while still being an adult in the present. Being a dwarf or an elf of some
description is enough, but the Half-spirit ancestries from Dungeon Fantasy 3:
The Next Level also fit. Another alternative is a Warforged who was an _active_
member of the Ravens but spent most of the intervening decades disabled and
unconscious.

**Benefits**: You remember some things. The GM will occasionally give you hints
and clues that might make it easier to find and access old Silver Raven
safehouses and stashes. You also knew the Ravens personally and they will
recognize you if you ever run into them.

Rules-wise Serendipity {15} is a good trait for it, and might even let you find
some of the campaign's secret doors and such without a roll. You can also buy
Hidden Lore (Demons) and Area Knowledge (Kintargo) even if these are not in your
template.

**Drawbacks**: Things remember you. Demons, vampires, and other similarly
long-lived monsters who faced the original Ravens 70 years ago will also
recognize you, and will be extra-mean to you as a result. Once word spreads that
you're back, some of them might even travel to Kintargo for the chance to kill
you.

This can be represented by Enemy (Monster of the Week, 9 or less) {-15}, as seen
no Jade's stats below.
