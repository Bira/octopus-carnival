This is your one stop shop for generating horribly mutated varieties of standard
monsters. The name "Sunwarped" comes from the belief that these mutations are
caused by Athas' burning sun, but there are many different causes. These
creatures might have been exposed to concentrated psionic energy, lived for too
long in defiled areas, or been victims of terrible experiments.

The Pristine Tower is also a prime source of mutated monstrosities, altering any
who linger near it for too long. To hear people talk about it, it was the _only_
such source in previous editions, but now it's just one more among many.

Sunwarped creatures are obviously misshapen when compared to typical
specimens. They might be exceedingly assymetrical, have extra limbs or eyes, and
so on. These descriptors give me a kind of "science fantasy" vibe, because they
match what you would expect radiation to do in 50s-style atomic horror tales.

Anyway, sunwarped creatures get a +2 to Endurance, and might also get one or two
**Sunwarped Traits** in addition to their extra theme powers. These traits
usually give it an extra bonus in one area and a small penalty in another. There
is a table here with some examples, but the GM is free to come up with others.

So a creature might get digging claws that give it climb and burrow speeds equal
to its base speed, but also reduce that base speed by 1. Or uneven eyes that
give it all-around vision but inflict a -3 penalty to ranged and area
attacks. Or something that gives +1 to one defense and -1 to another.

All of these changes are situational, and their effectiveness depends entirely
on the monster they get applied to. A Brute with no ranged attacks will find
those uneven eyes to be a pure bonus, while an extra limb that aids in grappling
would be wasted on an artillery monster. While you can min-max and only give
monsters traits that increase their power, you can also do the opposite to show
how random these mutations can be.

## Attack Powers

The split is pretty clear in this theme - attack powers either deal damage or
apply debuffs to others.

- **Breath of the Blazing Sun** probably has this name because almost no one in
  Athas would know what radiation is. It's a Close Blast 4 vs. Fortitude that
  makes its targets vulnerabilities to radiant and fire damage (save ends).

- **Burning Blood** will make xenomorph fans happy, as it represents a
  high-pressure jet of hazardous blood spraying out when the creature is
  hit. This is a reaction that makes a Close Blast 3 attack vs. Reflex, and
  inflicts ongoing acid + fire damage (save ends).

- **Ravaging Fury** is a free action encounter power, meaning it can be used in
  the creature's own turn without spending actions. Once this is used, if the
  creature hits with its next attack it will immediately gain an action point
  that it can use before the end of its next turn.

- **Sticky Hide** makes the monster be constantly covered in goo. Any enemy that
  hits the creature with a melee attack is subject to an attack vs. their
  Reflex, and if that hits the weapon used on the attack gets yanked out of
  their and and stuck on the monster's sticky coating. Recover it requires
  staying adjacent to the monster and spending a standard action, but at least
  it's automatic.


## Utility Powers

These heal of buff the creature itself.

- **Enraged Growth** makes the monster grow one size category when first
  bloodied! It pushes anyone adjacent to make room, and gains 10 temporary
  HP/tier. This gets more awesome when you apply it to a monster that is already
  big.

- **Feast on Flesh** causes the creature's melee basic attack to give it 5/tier
  temporary HP on a hit as it consumes some of the target's flesh. The book
  itself says that while you'd expect to see this only for bite attacks, you can
  add it to any attack and come up with a suitably freaky explanation for why it
  works.

- **Misshapen Body** means the creature's important anatomical bits are not
  where you'd expect them to be, so it can roll a d20 when it takes a critical
  hit, downgrading it to a normal hit on a result of 10+. These are the same
  mechanics of a normal save, but since they're written out in full I guess it
  means it doesn't _count_ as a save, so wouldn't get general save bonuses such
  as those of an elite or solo.

- You can also make such misshapen creatures **Steady-Footed**, letting them
  also roll actual saves against falling prone because their weird shape ends up
  being more stable.

## Impressions

I get a very strong "atomic horror" vibe from this theme, except it's happening
in a setting where people don't know about radiation, and so the mutations get
blamed on other causes.
