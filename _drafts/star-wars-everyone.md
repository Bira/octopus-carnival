Most of my experiences playing Star Wars RPGs were with the classic system from
West End, decades ago now. A few sessions under a couple of different GMs, both
of whom were big fans of the setting and the system. I've also read some of the
books one of these friends had. I'm sure my impressions in the rest of this post
are a mix from the actual game text and from the GMs in question. It's been a
while, so please take my descriptions with a grain of salt.

The memory that sticks with me the most was that WEG's take on playing a Jedi
was "don't". As a game written in the late 80s/early 90s, it placed a lot of
importance on the Official Stories. Since there wasn't much of an "extended
universe" back then, that meant the original trilogy of movies. And those movies
stated that the only Jedi left in the galaxy were those that appeared on
screen. And you can't play _those_, they're much too awesome to become mere PCs.

While subsequent games became less restrictive about the ability to play a Jedi,
they seem to have kinda inherited some of WEG's outlook when implementing
them. Jedi are usually the best at using the Force. If there are rules for
non-Jedi Force users, they're usually for some sort of "Force Adept" that's
distinctly second fiddle to Jedi. You only play them when Jedi aren't available,
or when your character concept demands it (the old "interesting or effective,
pick one" dilemma).

Anyway, as you might have guessed from the rant above, I'd do things differently
if I ever GMed a Star Wars game. In short, the Force would really work as
advertised in A New Hope: it connects everyone in the galaxy, and therefore it's
present in everyone in the galaxy.

## How does this work?

Under this model, the ability to sense and interact with the Force is not a rare
hereditary trait, but something anyone can learn with the proper training. And
"the proper training" does not necessarily mean _Jedi_ training.

Focused training and practice on nearly any skill will eventually awaken you to
the Force, and a lot of disciplines were developed around these skills over the
galaxy's long history. Someone who gets good enough at basically anything will
begin learning and consciously using Force tricks and techniques to become even
better. None of this "subconscious and intuitive usage" that past games have
tried to do.

A lot of stuff that used to be exclusive to the Jedi becomes much more
widespread. Pilots and gunslingers can benefit from enhanced reflexes and
short-term precognition. Artisans and engineers enter deep meditative states
that let them create masterworks or keep heaps of junk running way past the
point they would have crumbled. Hackers develop machine empathy. Spies can do
the Mind Trick or erase themselves from other's perceptions. Everyone can
develop basic sensing and intuition abilities. This is all normal and
traditional.

In your typical cinematic action campaign, anyone who's badass enough to be a
player character is also badass enough to be a Force user on par with a Jedi in
standard games. In GURPS many of the traits that allow a character to be
considered a cinematic hero are conscious expressions of the Force. Examples
include Trained by a Master, Gunslinger, Wildcard skills and even high levels of
Talent that push skills beyond what's realistic. So are traits like Intuition
and Empathy. Such characters would also have access to more explicitly mystical
powers.

Of course, it's not unusual for NPCs to be Force users either, even if they're
not conventional heroes. PCs might quest to find a powerful seer, or to have
their equipment built or improved by a master crafter, or there might be a
freighter pilot who isn't a conventional ace but can conceal their ship from
enemy sensors and sneak past blockades.

And yes, you can still choose to play a Jedi. Here they're distinguished more by
their philosophy than by their powers, since a lot of what they can do is
widespread knowledge among many other "schools" of the Force. Jedi in our
version of the setting are still wandering protectors of the Galaxy but they are
no longer the gatekeepers of the Force. They're happy to see people get in touch
with it by whatever paths are most suited to them. Their signature technique is
a form of communal mind-link or battle meditation that boosts their allies. The
Jedi do not focus on being powerful, but on making those around them powerful.

### What about the bad guys?

You can find villainous Force users anywhere you can find other villains. Some
are affiliated with the Empire, some are independent. Generally, their powers
tend to be very similar to those of heroic characters - the Dark Side is more of
a moral parable and a metaphor than a separate set of powers. The Enemy Ace uses
the same piloting-boosting powers as the Heroic Ace, but he uses it to bomb
civilians and destroy fleeing refugee transports.

What about the Empire, then? In standard Star Wars, the Empire is more or less
the antithesis of everything that is good, and it would be so even if there were
no Sith involved in running it. In our variant setting, where everyone has a
connection to the Force and this is seen as a good thing, the Empire adds a
strong "Force-elitist" streak to its long list of bad traits. In a galaxy where
everyone is Force-sensitive, the Empire believes the Force should be the
exclusive domain of a chosen few. As you might expect, its propaganda accuses
its own enemies of being elitist, and "lording over the common citizen" with
their spooky powers. Projection all the way down.

The training regimen it applies to its rank-and-file soldiers _prevents_ them
from learning Force techniques on their own, while making them susceptible to
being used as "batteries" by the Sith, whose special technique is the exact
opposite of the Jedi's: they're Force vampires, making themselves powerful at
the expense of others.

Of course, the Empire also seeks to recruit skilled Force users whose moral
outlook is compatible with its own. These will be dangerous named opponents and
might or might not employ Sith techniques.

### What about droids?

The issue of droids in Star Wars is tangled enough that it merits its own
post. For this one, I will just say the following: droids who are _named
characters_ definitely count as people and they _can_ learn how to use the
Force. That certainly applies to all droid PCs.



## In GURPS

The easiest way to do this in GURPS, I feel, is to say that every cinematic
trait in the campaign is a form of Force power and gets the Force (-10%)
modifier. This makes it possible for these traits to be disrupted or detected by
outside means. Force Powers include advantages like Gunslinger, Trained by a
Master, Gadgeteer, and even skill-related Talents. Weapon Master doesn't exist,
as TL 11 melee weapons are strong enough without that extra damage bonus.

More mystical powers are also possible, using the rules from GURPS Psionic
Powers with the Force power modifier.

Every player character has access to all these abilities, even if they're
droids. A quick way to do it would be to start with slightly modified Action
templates. A lot of those _already have_ Force abilities under our new
definition, but we might also want to add 50 extra points for the more mystical
stuff and for paying for alien or droid templates.

To make it even more clear, the powers usually ascribed to the Jedi in media
(super jumps, telekinesis, ESP) are _all_ available to non-Jedi characters. All
you need is something in your background description mentioning where you
learned it.

GMs who want to make the different schools more distinctive can add a few
exclusive techniques to them, like the Jedi battle meditation or the Sith
force-vampirism. They're not necessarily more powerful than "common" techniques,
but they are distinctive.

While lightsabers (also known as force swords in GURPS) are excellent melee
weapons, making them an effective alternative to blasters requires a large
amount of points. So I think there's no problem in saying these weapons and the
associated special techniques are widely available to non-Jedi. There's probably
several lightsaber schools out there. Studying the blade is a significant
investment that pays off, but it's not the only path to badassitude.
