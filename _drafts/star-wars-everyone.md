Most of my experiences playing Star Wars RPGs were with the classic system from
West End, years ago now. A few sessions under a couple of different GMs, both of
whom were big fans of the setting and the system. I've also read some of the
books one of these friends had. I'm sure my impressions in the rest of this post
are a mix from the actual game text and from the GMs in question. It's been a
while.

The memory that sticks with me the most is that the game put us players in a
state of constant "Jedi tension". It both sold Jedi as the most awesome
character type in the entire galaxy, and strictly forbid players from being
one. As a game written in the late 80s/early 90s, it placed a lot of importance
on the Official Stories. And since there wasn't much of an "extended universe"
back then, that meant the original trilogy of movies.

By default, campaigns in that game took place either shortly before Episode IV,
or somewhere during the original trilogy. The authors had decided the only Jedi
left in the Galaxy were those that appeared on-screen, and so therefore players
couldn't make Jedi characters. Oh, there were rules for being a Jedi, because
they had to show stats for the canonical characters, but you couldn't actually
play one.

Want to make a new, heretofore unknown Jedi survivor? You can't, there aren't
any! Want to play one of the canonical characters? You can't, they're Official
NPCs and therefore both untouchable and much more awesome than you can ever hope
to be. The closer you could get was to play a "Force-sensitive" character who
was either completely untrained, or belonged to some quirky alien tradition that
escaped the Empire's purge by sheer luck. You were distinctly second-fiddle to a
proper Jedi. And yeah, even though Luke himself fit the "untrained sensitive"
category during Episode IV, it would take around 10 years of weekly sessions for
a starting PC with that archetype to reach Luke's official stats.

I think a bit of this attitude might have ended up being inherited by subsequent
games in the franchise, because the implementation they go with is very similar
even when the setting is not as restrictive. Jedi are the best at using the
Force. No other class or archetype can even attempt it, save perhaps for the
weaker "Force Adept" that acts as a consolation prize when Jedi aren't playable.

Anyway, as you might have guessed from the rant above, I'd do things differently
if I ever GMed a Star Wars game. In short, the Force would really work as
advertised in A New Hope: it connects everyone in the galaxy, and therefore it's
present in everyone in the galaxy.

## How does this work?

Under this model, the ability to sense and interact with the Force is not a rare
hereditary trait, but something anyone can learn with the proper training. And
"the proper training" does not necessarily mean _Jedi_ training.

Focused training and practice on nearly any skill will eventually awaken you to
the Force, and a lot of disciplines were developed around these skills over the
galaxy's long history. Someone who gets good enough at basically anything will
begin learning and consciously using Force tricks and techniques to become even
better. None of this "subconscious and intuitive usage" that past games have
tried to do.

A lot of stuff that used to be exclusive to the Jedi becomes much more
widespread. Pilots and gunslingers can benefit from enhanced reflexes and
short-term precognition. Artisans and engineers enter deep meditative states
that let them create masterworks or keep heaps of junk running way past the
point they would have crumbled. Hackers develop machine empathy. Spies can do
the Mind Trick or erase themselves from other's perceptions. Everyone can
develop basic sensing and intuition abilities. This is all normal and
traditional.

In your typical cinematic action campaign, anyone who's badass enough to be a
player character is also badass enough to be a Force user on par with a Jedi in
standard games. In GURPS many of the traits that allow a character to be
considered a cinematic hero are conscious expressions of the Force. Examples
include Trained by a Master, Gunslinger, Wildcard skills and even high levels of
Talent that push skills beyond what's realistic. So are traits like Intuition
and Empathy. Such characters would also have access to more explicitly mystical
powers.

Of course, it's not unusual for NPCs to be Force users either, even if they're
not conventional heroes. PCs might quest to find a powerful seer, or to have
their equipment built or improved by a master crafter, or there might be a
freighter pilot who isn't a conventional ace but can conceal their ship from
enemy sensors and sneak past blockades.

And yes, you can still choose to play a Jedi. Here they're distinguished more by
their philosophy than by their powers, since a lot of what they can do is
widespread knowledge among many other "schools" of the Force. Jedi in our
version of the setting are still wandering protectors of the Galaxy but they are
no longer the gatekeepers of the Force. They're happy to see people get in touch
with it by whatever paths are most suited to them. Their signature technique is
a form of communal mind-link or battle meditation that boosts their allies. The
Jedi do not focus on being powerful, but on making those around them powerful.

### What about the bad guys?

In standard Star Wars, the Empire is more or less the antithesis of everything
that is good, and it would be so even if there were no Sith involved in running
it. It ticks all the fascism boxes, and the fact that it does so is a conscious
decision on the part of the writers going back to George Lucas himself. Any
portrayal that tries to say they maybe have a point is at best incorrect. The
First Order from the sequel movies is pretty much a warmed-over Empire and so is
just as bad.

In our variant setting, where everyone has a connection to the Force and this is
seen as a good thing, the Empire adds a strong "Force-elitist" streak to its
long list of bad traits. In a galaxy where everyone is Force-sensitive, the
Empire believes the Force should be the exclusive domain of a chosen few.

The Empire seeks to recruit skilled people whose moral outlook is compatible
with its own, while at the same time outlawing and suppressing traditional Force
training in the areas it occupies. Of course, it also recruits plenty of people
with no particular skill in the Force, since those stormtroopers and random crew
members have to come from somewhere. The training given to these people
_prevents_ them from learning Force techniques of their own, and is mixed with
plenty of propaganda about how this is better than relying on "ancient
religions" their superstitions.

Just like it happens over on the Light Side, there are many villainous Force
users in the setting. You can find them anywhere you can find other
villains. Some are affiliated with the Empire, some are independent but still
bad. Their powers tend to be very similar to those of heroic characters - the
Dark Side is more of a moral parable and a metaphor than a separate set of
powers. The Enemy Ace uses the same piloting-boosting powers as the Heroic Ace,
but he uses it to bomb civilians and destroy refugee

Our version of the Sith is the complete opposite of our Jedi, which is fitting
since the Sith are still an evil offshoot of the Jedi. They are the ultimate
elitists, believing only themselves worthy of wielding the power of the
Force. The Sith form the true "inner circle" of the Empire, lording over even
its other named elites the same way those elites lord over the mooks. The number
of "true" Sith is about as limited as it is in the movies, but they're fond of
cultivating "lesser" orders of servants beholden to a specific individual.

Their signature technique is the inverse of the one taught by the Jedi: they're
Force vampires, weakening those around them to strengthen themselves. The
training they give their servants opens them up to this drain.

## In GURPS

The easiest way to do this in GURPS, I feel, is to say that every cinematic
trait in the campaign is a form of Force power and gets the Force (-10%)
modifier. This makes it possible for these traits to be disrupted or detected by
outside means. Force Powers include advantages like Gunslinger, Trained by a
Master, Gadgeteer, and even skill-related Talents. Weapon Master doesn't exist,
as TL 11 melee weapons are strong enough without that extra damage bonus.

More mystical powers are also possible, using the rules from GURPS Psionic
Powers with the Force power modifier.

Every player character has access to all these abilities, even if they're
droids. A quick way to do it would be to start with slightly modified Action
templates. A lot of those _already have_ Force abilities under our new
definition, but we might also want to add 50 extra points for the more mystical
stuff and for paying for alien or droid templates.

To make it even more clear, the powers usually ascribed to the Jedi in media
(super jumps, telekinesis, ESP) are _all_ available to non-Jedi characters. All
you need is something in your background description mentioning where you
learned it.

GMs who want to make the different schools more distinctive can add a few
exclusive techniques to them, like the Jedi battle meditation or the Sith
force-vampirism. They're not necessarily more powerful or even necessarily
exclusive, but they are distinctive.

While lightsabers (also known as force swords in GURPS) are excellent melee
weapons, making them an effective alternative to blasters requires a significant
investment in points. So I think there's no problem in saying these weapons and
the associated special techniques are widely available to non-Jedi. Not everyone
will bother spending the points, but those who do will be rewarded with being
badass saber-users. The decision is more about style or about making a
statement than it is about raw power.
