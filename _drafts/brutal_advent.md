Welcome to another post in my X-COM: Noises in the Dark actual play report!
As we saw in the [previous post][1] in this series, the newly formed X-COM spent
its first month of existence futilely scanning the planet for alien activity
before they found anything actionable. And it came not from their state of the
art spy satellite network, but from a Youtube video recorded by a little girl.
