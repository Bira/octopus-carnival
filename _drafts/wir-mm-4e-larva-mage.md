This is part of a series! Go [here][1] to see the other entries.

"Larva Mage" is a more generic name for the Spawn of Kyuss, a monster that
as far as I know appeared in the Age of Worms adventure path for 3e. Here, they
are only present in the MM.

## The Lore

A larva mage is what you get when an evil spellcaster dies and their restless
spirit takes over the maggots infesting their corpse. This possessed mass
assembles itself in a roughly humanoid shape to seek revenge or simply to
continue whatever schemes it had in life.

On the surface larva mages seem like a more disgusting variety of lich, and you
could play them that way, but there are some differences. Becoming a larva mage
is a spontaneous process, not an intentional ritual, and it may cause the mage
to lose some of the magic power it had in life.

A particularly powerful specimen might retain much of its power, but it's not
guaranteed. The first larva mages were created by an elder evil named Kyuss, to
guard vaults of forbidden lore. These are the most powerful among their kind.

Though larva mages are hard to hurt, they can be destroyed through a sufficient
application of violence. When that happens, the worms that comprise their bodies
lose their cohesion and sapience.

## The Numbers

We get a single stat block, which supposedly represents a "typical" larva mage
whose powers are a mix of spells and being made of worms. You can give them more
combat spells and however many rituals you think are appropriate to represent an
individual that retained more of their magic ability.

### Larva Mage

This is a Medium Natural Magical Beast (undead), and a Level 21 Elite Artillery
monster with 304 HP. As an undead, it has Resist 10 Necrotic and Vulnerable 10
Radiant. As a swarm creature, it takes half damage from melee and ranged
attacks, and has Vulnerable 10 to close and area attacks. A radiant area attack
will really ruin this thing's day.

Larva Mages have Speed 6, and like the lamias we just covered, they can
disassemble to squeeze through openings as if they were Tiny creatures.

The larva mage's basic attack is a **Corrupting Touch** that does necrotic
damage, but as an artillery monster it doesn't want anyone to get close to
it. For that, it will use its **Horrific Visage** (Ranged 10 vs. Will; minor
action; recharge 5-6) on melee-focused PCs. This dazes them and prevents them
from attacking the mage (save ends).

It will follow that up with **Rays of Cold Death** (Ranged 20 vs. AC), which do
cold and necrotic damage, with a big damage bonus against bloodied
targets. Against groups it will use **Withering Flame** (Area 1 within 20
vs. Reflex) for fire and necrotic damage.

If someone looks like they're near death or manages to get too close, the mage
will use **Worm's Feast** (Ranged 5 vs. Will; recharge 6), an illusion that
tricks the victim into believing worms are eating their flesh. This does a big
chunk of untyped damage, but _only_ if that damage would reduce the target to 0
HP. If it wouldn't, the victim is instead stunned for a turn.

## Sample Encounters and Final Impressions

We get three sample encounters:

- Level 21: 1 larva mage, 4 slaughter wrights, 1 sword wraith.

- Level 22: 1 larva mage, 3 rot harbingers, 5 abyssal ghoul myrmidons.

- Level 22: 2 larva magi, 2 rockfire dreadnoughts, 8 grimlock followers.

From this we gather that larva mages tend to hang out with other high level
undead, or similarly powerful summoned servants depending on what spells they
knew back in life. They need these servants, too, since they're pretty much dead
if an epic-level party manages to corner them in melee. If their buddies manage
to keep the PCs far away, though, they can do a lot of damage.

I haven't actually read Age of Worms or anything else related to Kyuss, so larva
mages don't stir any strong emotion in me in that regard. Their imagery is nice
and creepy, though.
