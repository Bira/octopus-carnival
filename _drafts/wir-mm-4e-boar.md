Boars are real animals, so you probably know what they look like
already. Boar-hunting was a very prestigious and difficult endeavor in medieval
times, since real-world wild boars are deadly opposition for someone armed with
a spear.

Still, the Monster Manual seems to think your typical PC party would have little
trouble handling real-world boars, much like Asterix and Obelix. So it provides
us with more extreme versions.

These exist only on the Monster Manual - while the Monster Vault has an appendix
on animals, it doesn't contain boars.

## Dire Boar

Like a real-world boar, but bigger, meaner, and spikier. It's a Large Natural
Beast (mount). Creatures with the "mount" keyword confer special abilities to
their riders if those riders have the Mounted Combat feat and fulfill any other
requirements (usually a minimum level) in the ability descriptions. Not all
beasts that can serve as mounts have the keyword - only those who grant these
abilities to their riders.

Indeed, dire boars can be domesticated as mounts, though even then they're
ill-tempered and tough to handle. They're also the preferred mount for dwarven
cavalry units. So yeah, dwarves have dire boar cavalry! It makes perfect sense
when you think about it: the riders have a temper to match that of their mounts,
and the mounts menace with spikes of bone.

Rules-wise, dire boars are Level 6 Brutes, have 85 HP, and move with
Speed 8. They attack by goring with their tusks, which does extra damage against
a prone target. When the boar is reduced to 0 HP, it gores one last time as a
free action.

They're also good at charging! A gore attack done as part of a charge does extra
damage, pushes the target 2 squares and knocks them prone. So their preferred
tactic is to charge someone and them gore them repeatedly while they're down.

While mounted by a level 6+ rider, the board gets to make a gore attack in
addition to the rider's attack when the duo charges. The way I understand it,
this gore attack also gets the charge benefit I described above.

## Thunderfury Boar

The platonic ideal of a badass boar, native to the Feywild. It's even bigger,
even meaner, and even spikier than a dire boar. This boar is a Large fey beast,
no mount keyword. You can't truly domesticate these beasts, but clever fey
sometimes keep them captive and release them in the general direction of people
they want dead. They have Int 5 but no languages. Whether this means they're
super-cunning animals or actually sapient is left as an exercise for the GM.

The thunderfury boar is a Level 15 Brute with 182 HP and ground speed 8. It
fights in much the same way as its cousing above, with goring charges followed
by more goring, but it has a few differences aside from the increased
damage. Its basic gore attack deals increased damage when the boar is bloodied,
and its charges deal an extra 10 thunder damage on top of that. It also has an
attack named Thunderfury, rechaging on 5-6, which from what I understand it is a
big stomp that sends a shockwave around the boar. It's a close burst 2 that
targets Fort, does thunder damage and knocks prone. On a miss, it still deals
half damage.

## Encounters and Final Impressions

The suggested encounter is level 5, a dire boar and a party of 5 orc regulars (1
shaman, 4 berserkers). Since none of the orcs are level 6+, it's likely none of
them are riding the boar.

The most awesome thing for me here was the bit about dwarven boar cavalry. I'm
really tempted to stat up a unit of level 6 dwarven knights riding dire
boars. Beware the charge of the 15th Thundertusks!
