Urist Stortebeker is a somewhat unorthodox dwarven priest because he honors gods
of freedom and knowledge such as Caiden Caylean, Avandra, and Ioun. This
naturally drew him to the Honored Society of Archivists in Kintargo a few years
ago. This was a secret organization dedicated to preserving the true history of
the Ravounel region and of wider Cheliax from the revisionist depredations of
its fascist government.

He was just walking the first steps to mastering their deep scholarship, but his
previous adventuring career made him very good at retrieving lost documents of
historical and cultural value, so that's what he mostly focused on.

He had been out on a mission to retrieve one of those documents when the Night
of Ashes happened. The agents of Barzilai Thrune, the newly appointed Lord Mayor
of Kintargo, swept through the city killing anyone who they thought might be
able to oppose his plans, and burning down their homes. This included the
members of the Society, most of whose identities Barzilai had figured out.

This makes Urist the last surviving Archivist, and you can be he's extremely
angry and sad about that. However, just before he left on that last mission,
some of his Archivist friends asked him to look after their son if anything
happened to them. They weren't sure anything _was_ going to happen, but things
weren't looking good in general.

So now Urist's top priority is finding this son, Rexus Victocora, and making
sure that he's safe. And then he's going to make those damned nazis pay. His
demeanor might be jolly but he's still a dwarf. He knows how to hold a grudge.

## Description

Urist has a very typical appearance to go with his very typical name. Stocky,
bald, pale skin, white beard, brown eyes. He always carries his clan dagger in
his belt, and his axe too. In combat he likes heavy armor and a shield to go
with the weapons. Unlike the typical dwarf character, he tends to act jolly a
lot of the time, even in the face of adversity and grief.

"Stortebeker" is an epithet that was applied to a historical Dutch pirate. It
means roughly "someone who upturns cups", which in turn means someone who drinks
a lot. Appropriate for a priest of the drunk god.

## Build Notes

Urist is a pretty typical Dungeon Fantasy Cleric, though he's more on the fighty
side of that archetype than on the "staff and robe" one. So in addition to more
spells, his progression plan is going to include better combat skills and
possibly some Holy Warrior abilities to make him better at directly fighting
demons.

As mentioned above, he's a dwarf, and his species traits have been included in
his character sheet below.
