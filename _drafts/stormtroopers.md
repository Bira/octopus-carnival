I've decided I'm going to write a few posts about villainous mooks found in
several science fiction universes. The first one deals with Star Wars'
stormtroopers, one of the most classic.

It's worth noting that the end result of this article is a bit similar to what
you can find in some of Mailanka's Psi Wars documents, which is only natural
since we have some of the same sources. However, the scope of this post is
rather more limited. It's directed at people who want these foes to their games
without building them entirely from scratch, and without having to learn an
entire new setting for them.

## Overview

Most people likely to read this will hardly need an introduction to
stormtroopers, but I'll provide one anyway.

Stormtroopers are the foot soldiers of the evil Galactic Empire that appears in
most Star Wars media. They're instantly recognizable by their white armor suits
with their face-concealing, vaguely skull-like helmets. They always appear in
large groups, commanded by officers in gray uniforms or directly by big-name
villains like Darth Vader.

The first Star Wars movie, A New Hope, describes them as having a fearsome
reputation. In practice, though, they're classic mooks, only dangerous in very
large numbers. Usually, the most they accomplish against the film's heroes is
making those heroes look badass.

Though they're not the first Space Mooks, they're one of the classics and likely
the first ones most of us were exposed to. The dissonance between their
reputation and their skill on-screen has been the subject of many jokes over the
decades, including an official GURPS cinematic rule named "Imperial Stormtrooper
Marksmanship Academy", and one I wrote named "[Imperial Stormtrooper Armor
Drills][1]".

## Lore Analysis

As their name indicates, Stormtroopers are more directly inspired by real-world
Nazis than most other science-fictional mooks. They pretty much _are_ Space
Nazis, from the way they're organized down to how their officer uniforms
look[^1].

The way the historical Nazis worked[^2] was by by creating parallel
organizations that would serve as the "inner circle" that held the real power
and influence in an area. And after a while, when that circle got too influent,
they'd create another one and spread that _this_ was there the real chosen ones
were.

The regular army's no good, all the really loyal badasses join the
stormtroopers/brownshirts. Then suddenly the brownshirts aren't "it" anymore,
and the real inner circle is the SS. And I think there were a few other
iterations like that before they were all stomped flat in WW2. It's worth
nothing that the members of such "inner circles" weren't necessarily more
_competent_ than their pleb colleagues, just more loyal to the regime and more
willing to commit atrocities in its name.

The "history" of stormtroopers differs a bit from that of the real world, of
course. The bits of Star Wars history we're concerned about here are the three
"eras" defined by the three main movie trilogies. Episodes 1 to 3 are the
"prequel" trilogy, 4 to 6[^3] are the "main" trilogy, and 7 to 9 are the
"sequel". "Eras" is a bit pompous - each one is only 20 years apart from the
next and lasts a lot less than that.

We'll look at that history below, but it's worth clarifying right now: all of
the stormtrooper forces described below are _mechanically equivalent_. Any
differences in their gear seem to be mostly cosmetic. Relevant variations will
be noted in each force's entry.

### The Prequels

The Star Wars prequel trilogy tells us about the fall of the Galactic Republic,
and the rise of the Empire. This sneaky asshole senator named Palpatine
manufactured a war against a coalition of separatist planets and then handed the
Republic a clone army on a platter so that they could fight it. He'd later use
secret implanted instructions to have the Clones perform a violent takeover of
the Republic.

The Clones, then, are our first layer of the onion, supplanting those disparate
planetary forces. Clones are mass-produced by a planet of biotech specialists,
and quickly reach physical maturity while undergoing an intense regimen of
training and indoctrination. After this, they're immediately deployed to the war
with a vague promise of being given "freedom" after it ends.

The Republic's acceptance of this "gift" was the first step on their road to
fascism. Both because they decided to overlook the obvious ethical problems with
the setup described above, and because they decided to not look too closely into
that indoctrination. When Order 66 is given, the vast majority of clones
instantly switch from being "our guys" to murdering all the Jedi and everyone
else who could oppose Palpatine's power grab.

### The Main Trilogy

Imperial Stormtroopers are our second layer of the onion, supplanting clones and
eventually replacing them entirely between the end of the prequels and the start
of the main trilogy. They rely on traditional recruiting to build their numbers,
their ranks swelling with the sort of crass bully who truly believed in the
Empire's new ideals. Imperial Officers seem to belong to a whole other hierarchy
that gets to order troopers around, descended from the one that commanded
clones. They're the next layer of the onion.

After that you get a succession of more specialized groups that vary with the
specific piece of media you're watching. Some sort of black-armored elite
trooper is almost traditional by now. There's also a number of sinister
organizations that vary with the specific work you're watching, such as the
creepy investigators of the Imperial Security Bureau or even an actual
Inquisition full of Dark Side Force users. The franchise usually seems to buy
into the statement that the people in these innermost circles really are more
competent, so when they appear they tend to be named villains.

Darth Vader and all of the people who directly reported to him feel like they'd
be the core of this particular onion... after all, he was the Emperor's personal
disciple. But even in at the start of the main trilogy, you see that there's a
group of high-ranking Imperial officers who are competing wit him for that
spot. So you definitely have room to have multiple organizations all of which
claim to be the top dogs of the Imperial forces in your campaigns.

### The Sequel Trilogy

If the Galactic Empire are Nazis, the First Order are neo-Nazis. An organization
full of people who idolize the Empire and what it stood for, and try to imitate
its visuals, command structure, and penchant for oppression and atrocity.

Everything I said about the Empire applies there. It's at a comparatively
earlier stage of the nazi onion since they still have powerful officers among
the troopers (like Commander Phasma), but the SS-like officer corps with their
Hugo Boss uniforms is already there and growing. Kylo Ren is our wannabe Vader
here, and he's also already clashing with the officer corps to see who deserves
to be at the top.

First order stormtroopers supplement their traditional recruiting with forcibly
kidnapped children that undergo similar indoctrination and training to the
clones of yesteryear. There are no "special units" of extra-badass troopers with
different armor, but you get more instances of random troopers who turn out to
not be mooks, and who give our heroes some more trouble all by themselves.

## Trooper Gear

The Star Wars franchise is pretty much the archetypal TL 11^ space opera setting
in GURPS terms. Much of the gear for that tech level and flavor of science
fiction is taken directly from Star Wars and given legally-permissible names. So
you don't have to do much in order to build a catalog of stormtrooper gear.

Depending on the source, stormtroopers gear is described as anything from
"scarily good" to "total trash". Here, I want to split the difference and make
it decent but not exceptional.

Most page references below refer to **GURPS Ultra-Tech** for Fourth Edition, and
are abreviated using the standard convention for that book. Page references to
other works will use their full names.

Your typical trooper is usually at Light encumbrance from the weight of their
armor and weapon.

### Armor

Trooper armor is composed of a black undersuit over which are attached white
armor plates. The suit has split DR - the higher value is for the body, the
lower one for the limbs. It's decent against direct hits from blaster pistols,
and excellent against any weapon less advanced than that, as well as shrapnel
and environmental hazards.

This suit of armor is usually paired with a TL 11 Combat Infantry Helmet
(p. UT180). The helmet attaches to the rest of the armor and forms an airtight
seal, and it counts as Sealed if an air tank is attached to the suit.

The specific design used by stormtroopers (of whatever era) is so distinctive
that PCs will probably only want to wear those suits when trying to impersonate
one. Suits with similar stats from non-Imperial manufacturers might be available
to PCs. Its stats are based on those of Hardshell Armor, published in **Pyramid
#3/12: Tech and Toys**.

| TL | Type               | Location       | DR    | Cost  | Weight | LC |
|:--:|:------------------:|:--------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:--:|
| 11 | Stormtrooper Armor | body and limbs | 60/30 | $2000 | 12kg   | 2  |

More elite "shock" troopers might wear a TL 11 Combat Hardsuit (p. UT179-180),
which offers more protection with only a small increase in weight by using more
advanced materials. It's greater cost explains why it's rarer.

### Weapons

Every single trooper carries a _Blaster Carbine_ (p. UT123). This carbine is
compact enough that it can sometimes be fired one-handed (Acc 5, ST 8). Some
upgrade this to a full _blaster rifle_ (same page). Either might have a "Stun"
setting with the same power and range as a _Nerve Pistol_ (p. UT122) but using
the gun's default Acc. This doesn't increase weapon weight or cost, since it's
so rarely used it might as well not be there.

Sometimes a squad of them will operate something similar to a _Semi-Portable
Blaster_ (same page), but with RoF 10 and Damage 9d+2(5) burn sur. This is fired
from a tripod and is either hastily assembled by the troopers, or mounted atop a
contragrav cart towed by a ground vehicle.

These beam weapons use superscience power cells, so their ammo reserves are 5
times the number shown in the book.

Stormtroopers rarely seem to use explosives, but if they carry any they'd
probably use the stats for HEC (p. UT154) or Plasma ( p. UT158) hand grenades.

Melee weapons are pretty much non-existent in most of the movies, but when they
are present they usually resemble staffs, batons or tonfas with a Neurolash
add-on (p. UT165) tuned for paralysis or pain. The power field these weapons
generate lets them parry light-sabers, making them dangerous in the hands of
skilled wielders.

## Trooper Training and Tactics

A single typical stormtrooper is not really a threat to a proper action
hero. Their combat skills hover around 12, and their attributes don't deviate
too far from the human average. They also follow all the rules named afted them,
which means their first shot against the PCs always misses, and any hit by a PC
takes them out regardless of what armor they're wearing.

Stormtrooper tactics resemble the tactics of action-movie mooks
everywhere. Fights against them are usually shootouts, where they'll take cover
and fire their blaster carbines at the heroes. When advancing, some troopers
charge forward while the others provide cover fire, then they switch. The more
the present scene looks like an all-out war, the more dynamic they tend to act,
but their basic mook-ness still remains.

Stormtrooper morale is unshakable in the most disturbing way, since they don't
really care about the deaths of their fellow troopers and usually fear their
sinister superiors a lot more than they fear the heroes. This makes pitched
battles against large forces of them quite dangerous despite their individual
weakness! The preferred way to deal with an army of troopers is to get around
them and only fight as many as you must. If a pitched battle does happen, you
need to take out enough of them for their commanders to give up, because they're
not going to decide to run away on their own.

## Specials and Elites

A campaign featuring a lot of stormtroopers tends to benefit from the inclusion
of special enemies that are harder to deal with. These can be named recurring
villains (like Darth Vader!), but they can also be "elite troopers" of some
description that present a bigger-than-baseline threat without requiring much in
the way of script rewrites when they go down.

There are lots of elite units within the Imperial forces, because every new
media source adds their own. Rather than trying to provide an exaustive list,
I'm going to speak about how to upgrade your generic troopers to represent them.

The easiest way to do this is to declare that a trooper or a small group of them
in the current scene is not subject to the usual mook rules. They hit when they
hit, their armor works, and they have HP. This might let them live enough to
speak a line or two, without necessarily making them part of an elite
group. Sometimes you can go a bit further and slightly increase their combat
skill.

"Melee troopers" are usually this sort of enemy. You usually want to
showcase the fact that their neurolash weapons can parry force swords, so they
should have enough skill to parry at least once.

True "elite" troopers add more special equipment on top of that. Their armor
tends to be a different color or have some other obvious visual marker
separating them from the riff-raff. Their weapons and armor might be better:
hardsuits instead of the basic armor, rifles instead of carbines, polearms
instead of clubs. They also tend to have additional equipment that makes a
difference in a fight, like grenades.

When one (or a unit) of these shows up, it's usually as the honor guard for a
villainous NPC, or as the security detail for a major adventure
objective. Meeting them means the PCs in for an actual fight. Some, like
Commander Phasma, are named villains themselves and might even survive to appear
again.
