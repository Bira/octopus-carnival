I've decided I'm going to write a few posts about villainous mooks found in
several science fiction universes. The first one deals with Star Wars'
stormtroopers, one of the most classic. Most people likely to read this will
hardly need an introduction to stormtroopers, but I'll provide one anyway.

## Overview

Stormtroopers are the foot soldiers of the evil Galactic Empire that appears in
most Star Wars media. They're instantly recognizable by their white armor suits
with their face-concealing, vaguely skull-like helmets. They always appear in
large groups, commanded by officers in gray uniforms or directly by big-name
villains like Darth Vader.

The first Star Wars movie, A New Hope, describes them as having a fearsome
reputation. In practice, though, they're classic mooks, and the most they
accomplish against the film's heroes is making those heroes look badass.

Though they're not the first Space Mooks, they're one of the classics and likely
the first ones most of us were exposed to. The dissonance between their
reputation and their skill on-screen has been the subject of many jokes over the
decades, including an official GURPS cinematic rule named "Imperial Stormtrooper
Marksmanship Academy", and one I wrote named "[Imperial Stormtrooper Armor
Drills][1]".

## Lore Analysis

As their name indicates, Stormtroopers are more directly inspired by real-world
Nazis than most other science-fictional mooks. They pretty much _are_ Space
Nazis, from the way they're organized down to how their officer uniforms
look[^1].

The way the historical Nazis worked[^2] was by by creating parallel
organizations that would serve as the "inner circle" that held the real power
and influence in an area. And after a while, when that circle got too influent,
they'd create another one and spread that _this_ was there the real chosen ones
were.

The regular army's no good, all the really loyal badasses join the
stormtroopers/brownshirts. Then suddenly the brownshirts aren't "it" anymore,
and the real inner circle is the SS. And I think there were a few other
iterations like that before they were all stomped flat in WW2. It's worth
nothing that the members of such "inner circles" weren't necessarily more
_competent_ than their pleb colleagues, just more loyal to the regime.

Imperial stormtrooopers are the same! I can easily see them being the "inner
circle" to the regular armed forces, their ranks swelling with the sort of crass
bully who truly believed in the Empire's new ideals until they were the entirety
of the Imperial armed forces[^3]. Imperial Officers seem to belong to a whole
other hierarchy that gets to order troopers around, so they could have been the
next layer on the onion.

After that you get a succession of more specialized groups that vary with the
specific piece of media you're watching. Some sort of black-armored elite
trooper is almost traditional by now. There's also a number of sinister
organizations that vary with the specific work you're watching, such as the
creepy investigators of the Imperial Intelligence Bureau or even an actual
Inquisition full of Dark Side Force users. The franchise usually seems to buy
into the statement that the people in these innermost circles really are more
competent, so when they appear they tend to be named villains.

The First Order of the "sequel" trilogy is pretty much the Empire with a
different name, and everything I said about the Empire applies there. It might
be at an earlier stage of the nazi onion since they still have powerful officers
among the troopers (like Commander Phasma), but the SS-like officer corps with
their Hugo Boss uniforms is already there and growing.

## Trooper Gear

The Star Wars franchise is pretty much the archetypal TL 11^ space opera setting
in GURPS terms. Much of the gear for that tech level and flavor of science
fiction is taken directly from Star Wars and given legally-permissible names. So
you don't have to do much in order to build a catalog of stormtrooper gear.

Depending on the source, stormtroopers gear is described as anything from
"scarily good" to "total trash". Here, I want to split the difference and make
it decent but not exceptional.

Most page references below refer to **GURPS Ultra-Tech** for Fourth Edition, and
are abreviated using the standard convention for that book. Page references to
other works will use their full names.

Your typical trooper is usually at Light encumbrance from the weight of their
armor and weapon.

### Armor

Trooper armor is composed of a black undersuit over which are attached white
armor plates. Due to its extremely distinctive design, non-troopers are usually
only going to wear it when impersonating a trooper. The suit has split DR - the
higher value is for the body, the lower one for the limbs.

This suit of armor is usually paired with an equally distinctive TL 11 Combat
Infantry Helmet (p. UT180). The helmet attaches to the rest of the
armor and forms an airtight seal, and it counts as Sealed if an air tank is
attached to the suit.

Similar armor suits from non-Imperial manufacturers might be available to
PCs. Its stats are based on those of Hardshell Armor, published in **Pyramid
#3/12: Tech and Toys**.

| TL | Type               | Location       | DR    | Cost  | Weight | LC |
|:--:|:------------------:|:--------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:--:|
| 11 | Stormtrooper Armor | body and limbs | 60/30 | $2000 | 12kg   | 2  |

### Weapons

Every single trooper carries a _Blaster Carbine_ (p. UT123). This carbine is
compact enough that it can sometimes be fired one-handed (Acc 5, ST 8). These
beam weapons use superscience power cells, so their ammo reserves are 5 times
the number shown in the book.

Sometimes a squad of them will operate something similar to a _Semi-Portable
Blaster_ (same page). There's also a larger model that weights twice as much and
has RoF 10, usually towed atop a contragrav cart. Like the carbines, these user
superscience power cells.

Stormtroopers rarely seem to use explosives, but if they carry any they'd
probably use the stats for HEC (p. UT154) or Plasma ( p. UT158) hand grenades.

Melee weapons are pretty much non-existent in most of the movies, but when they
are present they usually resemble staffs, batons or tonfas with a Neurolash
add-on (p. UT165) tuned for paralysis or pain. The power field these weapons
generate lets them parry light-sabers, so a "melee trooper" is usually a bit
more dangerous than their colleagues and might even get a line or two.

## Trooper Training and Tactics

A single typical stormtrooper is not really a threat to a proper action
hero. Their combat skills hover around 12, and their attributes don't deviate
too far from the human average. They also follow all the rules named afted them,
which means their first shot against the PCs always misses, and any hit by a PC
takes them out regardless of what armor they're wearing. They're much more
dangerous in large numbers, which is how they're always encountered.

Stormtrooper tactics resemble the tactics of action-movie mooks
everywhere. Fights against them are usually shootouts, where they'll take cover
and fire their blaster carbines at the heroes. When they feel they have the
advantage, or when there's not much cover in the first place, they'll advance
en masse at a slow walk, firing constantly. The more the present scene looks
like an all-out war, the more dynamic they tend to act, but their basic
mook-ness still remains.

Stormtrooper morale is unshakable in the most disturbing way, since they don't
really care about the deaths of their fellow troopers and usually fear their
sinister superiors a lot more than they fear the heroes. So when fighting a
large force of stormtroopers, you need to either wipe them all out, or
accomplish your objectives without turning your mission into a static battle.

## Specials and Elites

An adventure featuring a lot of stormtroopers tends to benefit from the
inclusion of special enemies that are harder to deal with. These can be named
recurring villains (like Darth Vader!), but they can also be "elite troopers" of
some description that present a bigger threat without requiring much in the way
of script rewrites.

There are lots of elite units within the Imperial forces, because every new
media source adds their own. Rather than trying to provide an exaustive list,
I'm going to speak about how to include them in your game in more generic terms.

The easiest way to add these is to simply declare that a trooper or a small
group of them in the current scene is not subject to the usual mook rules. They
hit when they hit, their armor works, and they have HP. Maybe their combat
skills are a bit higher. This might let them live enough to speak a line or two,
without necessarily making them part of an elite group.

"Melee troopers" are usually this sort of enemy. You usually want to
showcase the fact that their neurolash weapons can parry force swords, so they
should have enough skill to parry at least once.

True "elite" troopers add more special equipment on top of that. Their armor
tends to be a different color or have some other obvious visual marker
separating them from the riff-raff. Their basic weapons are better: rifles
instead of carbines, or polearms instead of clubs. They also tend to have
additional equipment that makes a difference in a fight, like grenades. The
really dangerous ones will likely be wearing actual combat hardsuits instead of
the usual light armor, too.

When one (or a unit) of these shows up, it's usually as the honor guard for a
villainous NPC, or as the security detail for a major adventure
objective. Meeting them means the PCs in for an actual fight. Some, like
Commander Phasma, are named villains themselves and might even survive to appear
again.
