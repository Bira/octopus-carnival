Gather round, friends! Come one, come all! Witness the greatest event to grace
our fine kingdom since the dragon attack last weekend! Here in our arena are the
three delvers most deadly at a distance, ready to finally see who's the
deadliest of them all!

This is not a contest of accuracy! We know that each and every one of these
brave warriors can hit the bullseye clear across the arena every time they
fire. No, dear spectators, this is a contest of _speed_! The contestant who
fires the most shots in a minute wins!

Our contestants are Legs, the non-binary Elf Scout with their trustly longbow;
[Harsk][1] the male Dwarf ranger with his heavy crossbow; and Layla the
Gun-Witch with her flintlock target pistol. So how fast can they go?

## Legs

Legs is a starting Scout with Heroic Archer, Bow-20 and Fast-Draw
(Arrow)-14. Each second, they can make an unmodified Fast-Draw (Arrow) roll to
instantly ready an arrow _and_ a Bow roll at -3 to instantly load it into the
bow. Success at both allows them to shoot at -3 to skill.

We're assuming every attack our contestants get to make will hit the target:
it's a small arena and no one is in danger. But how often would Legs get to
fire?

Legs will succeed at 90% of their Fast-Draw rolls - in a minute, that's 6
failures. Each one represents a missed opportunity to fire that second. They
would also fail roughly 5% of their Bow rolls, which would mean another 2
failures out of the remaining 54 chances. So Legs the starting character would
shoot 52 arrows in a minute.

That's an impressive performance in real-world terms. Can we improve it even
further?

The most immediate improvement can be had by increasing Fast-Draw to 16 for 5
points. At that skill level we're only failing 2% of our rolls, meaning we'd
fire a total of 57 arrows that minute! A single extra point would buy us the
Flawless Fast-Draw perk from Pyramid #3/61: The Way of the Warrior. That would
allow us to consider all of our Fast-Draw attempts automatic successes,
increasing our number of shots to 58.

Another 5 points would increase Legs' Bow skill to 19 and buy them the Flawless
Nocking perk from the same Pyramid issue, finally bringing us to that
perfect 60 for a total of 11 points.

## Harsk

Our old friend [Harsk][1] has Heroic Crossbowman, Crossbow-20, Fast-Draw
(Arrow)-15, and the Quick-Reload perk. Quick-Reload is from **GURPS Gun-Fu**,
where it's described in terms of how fast you can reload guns based on their
feeding mechanisms. The crossbow version is described alongside Harsk himself,
requiring Heroic Crossbowman (unlike the gun versions, which are considered
realistic) and allowing him to cock and load his crossbow in a single second
with a successful Fast Draw roll. He can then make a Crossbow roll at -3 to
finish readying it and fire at the same turn (also at a -3 penalty).

His higher base skill levels would mean he would only fail 2 Fast-Draw rolls and
1 Crossbow roll in that minute. However, a failed Fast-Draw roll would mean he
wastes _three_ seconds instead of one, bringing his total shots fired to 53.

Bringing his Fast-Draw to 16 and buying Flawless Fast-Draw would cost 3 points,
making it a very worthwhile investment that brings his total to 59. Another
single point would buy him Flawless Nocking and bring his total to 60.

Do note that Harsk is built on the same template as Legs - it's very possible
Legs could have spent the same extra points he did to bring their skill totals
up. We can consider the two mostly equivalent despite the difference in
weaponry.

## Layla

Layla the Gun-Witch is built on the Gunner template from Pyramid #3/36. She has
Gunslinger, Quick-Reload 3, Guns (Pistol)-19 and Fast-Draw (Ammo)-16, and is
firing the Pistol from the same Pyramid issue, which is a smoothbore flintlock
with RoF 1 (20). This seems to make her the underdog in this competition. Can
she catch up?

If Layla uses paper cartridges, her reload time drops by half to 10
seconds. Fast-Draw _without_ Quick-Reload would reduce this to 8. Each level of
Quick-Reload would make a Fast-Draw success instead take 25% off the total
reload time, to a minumum of 3 seconds.
