title: "Dragon's Dogma: High Concept"
category: gurps
---

There are many ways in which I could tackle this project. The order of the
chapters in [GURPS Adaptations][adaptations] is as good as any. Therefore, we'll
start our Dragon's Dogma adaptation by looking at the setting's high concept and
considering our general approach to converting it to GURPS.

## What is Dragon's Dogma?

Dragon's Dogma is a video game originally released for the Playstation 3, where
it was shortly followed by a big expansion named "Dragon's Dogma: Dark
Arisen". The expansion contains the full original game and adds a several new
areas and features to it. More recently, the game was ported to PC.

This is an action game with RPG elements, set in a fantasy world. Its combat is
quite dynamic and its soundtrack excellent. Its setting contains quite a few
distinctive elements, which we will explore in detail below.

## Spoiler Alert?


One thing I must get out of the way immediately is how full of spoilers this
series of articles is going to be. The game's plot contains several important
twists, and while it does enjoy commercial success, it's not so famous that I
can simply assume any potential reader has already played it.

This adaptation will mostly depict the setting as it stands before the game
starts, and discuss information that is common knowledge to the characters who
live there. There will be separate posts dealing with its deeper secrets, and
those will both contain spoilers be marked as such.

## Themes


### The Eternal Cycle


> Land and skies, and seas yearn
>
> Finish the cycle of eternal return!
>
> >  From the Dragon's Dogma song "Eternal Return"

This "Eternal Return" is the original game's main theme. Every once in a great
while (years, decades, sometimes centuries), a huge rift opens in the sky of its
fantasy setting and an enormous dragon comes through. Every time this happens,
the dragon binds a specific human to it by ritually stealing and eating their
heart. This chosen victim is known as the Arisen, for instead of dying they
carry on living without a pulse, and possessed of a strange mental link to the
dragon.

Each Arisen is fated to confront their dragon. Those who are successful are
hailed as heroes, and often become rulers: there are at least two dinasties
started by former Arisen. In fact, the society of the entire world is shaped by
this cycle. This has happened many times in the past, and if there's one thing
the inhabitants of this world can be sure of, is that it will happen again.

This theme gets a lot of exposure, pretty much constantly. Several of the
setting elements connected to it have existed in the world for so long no one
finds them unusual. Much of the game's plot involves finding out ancient clues
about these draconic invasions. Plenty of NPCs will never stop reminding you
that the ruler of the nation where the story takes place is a former Arisen
himself. They will also constantly remind you that there's a fight against the
dragon looming in your future. And the verses quoted above show up in one form
or another in most of the game's soundtrack.

### Antiquity

The land is old, and that doesn't just mean it's full of dungeons,
either. Several landmarks you pass by regularly are structures build in ancient
times, and your chatty NPC companions will always remark upon this. Some are so
old no one even remembers who built them, or what they are for. Few people seem
to be curious about this, either, which is another sign that from their point of
view this stuff has just always been there.

### Danger

A small army of monsters enters the world along with the Dragon, and many others
are either native or managed to survive and form stable populations after a
previous invasion. While there are safe spaces for humanity here and there, the
space between them is monster territory. Several of the in-game NPC remarks and
plot points show that keeping even a minimum standard of safety is a thankless
job, and that major incursions are a constant danger.

Every time the player goes into a dungeon or transitions between areas while
inside one, the loading screen displays scary messages emphasizing how dangerous
the place is.

Often, when the player defeats a particularly nasty monster, nearby NPCs will
remark on how unusual and spectacular that feat it. "Normal" people can only
hope to stand against these in great numbers, and expecting losses.


## Setting

The setting of Dragon's Dogma will be discussed in greater detail in future
posts, I'll give a brief description here.

The whole game takes place in the independent duchy of Gransys, which shares an
unnamed fantasy world with several other nations from which it is separated by a
mountain range or by the sea. It looks and feels quite medieval, with NPC
clothing often remniscent of 13th and 14th century European attire (PC clothing
and gear tends to be more outlandish). Their speech patterns are distinctive as
well - the characters in this game do a better job of sounding medieval than
those in many others. The landscape is typical of Europe-inspired fantasy
settings, with forests, plains and mountains. The "age" and "danger" themes
discussed above are heavily expressed in the design of this landscape, too.

Other nations are mentioned by name, and some of the NPCs come from them, but
the player never goes there.

There is magic, and its existence is public. It is learned through the study of
arcane principles. Most characters are human, and are racially diverse. The
single nonhuman people (as opposed to monsters) are the Pawns. Pawns look human
but have a different, somewhat alien mentality. They mostly wander the land
working as mercenaries, but all have a special tie to the Arisen.

## Gameplay


What do you do as an Arisen in Dragon's Dogma? You walk the land either
searching for answers to the mystery of the Dragon, or performing tasks for the
Duke to make the kingdom of Gransys a safer place. Both often involve entering
dark underground ruins, fighting a lot of monsters, and plundering their
treasure. The deepest, darkest secrets are buried in the deepest, darkest, most
dangerous dungeons.

The game is single-player, but party-based. You directly control the Arisen and
are accompanied by anywhere from one to three AI-controlled Pawns. One of those
you create with the same level of detail as the Arisen. The others come from
other players.

You belong to one of nine different "vocations", which are in effect character
classes. Each one uses different equipment and has different abilities, which
you learn as you "rank up" in each vocation. It's possible to go somewhere and
find a monster that's vastly more powerful than what you're prepared to deal
with at the moment.

Combat is real-time and fairly dynamic. Martial characters attack with weapons
and have a varied repertoire of techniques as special powers. Spellcasters use
staves and cast spells. Spells can consist of elemental attacks and buffs,
health and status healing, or debuffs. Matching elemental effects to enemy
weaknesses is an important strategy.

There is limited grappling, too, as it's possible to restrain human-scale
enemies so an ally can kill them. It's also possible to _climb_ larger "boss"
monsters in order to reach their weak spots.

Most of the time is spent travelling on foot to important locations and
exploring them. The game's cities are more than just abstract collections of
shops, but there's only two of them on the map, with the rest of it being
dungeon/quest sites and the monster-infested hinterlands. There are plenty of
sidequests of the "kill X enemies" or "fetch X items" sort, and you _can_ ignore
the main plot to work on them, but many can be completed as you work on said
main plot.

There is a vast amount of items and equipment available, and you can improve
your equipment by working with an armorer and providing them with payment and
specific materials (many of which are monster parts).

As in all games, there is some conflict between story and gameplay, but it's not
especially jarring. The biggest element of this would be Gransys' somewhat
truncated map. It only has two settlements with all its other locations
consisting of dungeon or quest sites, but the story implies the duchy is bigger
than that.

## Adaptation Stragegy


Given Gransys's overall look and feel, and what is expected of the player in the
original game, this definitely sounds like a job for Dungeon Fantasy! That line
will provide an excellent starting base, and only a little additional
customization should be required to cover the elements unique to Dragon's Dogma.

What would thes elements be? The first one is that it goes a bit beyond the
default DF assumption that "town" is an abstract place to buy stuff between
dungeon raids. "Town" is a concrete place, what goes on there is important, and
can be an adventure in itself.

On the other hand, it doesn't to _that_ much beyond the default assumption, as
we've seen. There are only two fully-detailed settlements in all of Gransys,
though the story implies there should be more. In our adaptation, we'll expand
the in-game map to the size it's supposed to be, and fill some of the extra
space with additional settlements. Or at least provide enough information
for the GM to come up with one when needed. This will also give us the added
benefit of more room to for dungeons and for wilderness adventuring.

Character-wise, some change will be needed to the default DF template set. All
magic in this setting is arcane, and most magicians are of the "staff and robes"
kind. We will also need an extra template or two to exemplify the "hybrid"
martial/magic vocations, which are the most distinctive. We should also come up
with a racial template for pawns, since they are a common sight. And, though not
every game needs to be about the Arisen, an Arisen meta-trait would be a useful
thing to have.

There's no need to replicate each and every item and piece of equipment from the
original game in GURPS, as GURPS already has a quite serviceable gear list that
does provide some overlap. We might stat up one of two particularly distinctive
items, though. And the equipment enhancement system is distinctive enough that
it needs a tabletop equivalent.

The most work-intensive bit, and the one most likely to yield dividends for
generic Dungeon Fantasy games, are the monsters. There's a ton of them, and DF
can always use more monsters! We'll try to link them to already existing GURPS
versions, but some will need their own stats.

Finally, but no less important, we'll take a look at each of these elements as
we go through them and discuss how they may be used in isolation in more generic
campaigns. This way, you can use this material for your own
"not-quite-Dragon's-Dogma" setting.
