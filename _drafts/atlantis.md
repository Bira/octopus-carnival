I've published an article about [underwater adventuring][1] in the past, in
which I mentioned that "fish-people" had several advantages over "land-lubbers"
when it came to mobility and fighting in an underwater environment. A later post
included [a few items][2] that could help those land-lubbers close the
gap... so how about we take a look at those fish-people now? As a bonus, you get
a nice little bundle of setting info you can drop on your campaign if you want.

## The Fate of Atlantis

The name "Atlantis" figures in the myths and legends of many more places than it
should. Cultures that have never heard of each other have stories about
Atlantis. The stories might differ but the name is always the same.

That's because ancient Atlantis was the largest and most powerful underwater
civilization to ever exist. Their skill at magic and engineering was unsurpassed
beneath the waves, and the way in which they combined both disciplines even awed
scholars from other powerful but land-bound empires. They even discovered the
secret to traveling between worlds, and spread to these new frontiers with
gusto.

Despite its power Atlantis eventually fell, as all empires do. The exact
sequence of events is more or less impossible to piece together, and mostly
irrelevant in the present day. The important bit is that their inter-world
travel network was the first thing to go, leaving countless outposts and larger
settlements isolated in different worlds. That's why each of them has a
different story about how Atlantis fell - those stories talk only about the bits
of it they knew about. In some, it happened overnight due to a cataclysm. In
others, they eventually morphed into successor cultures that might still be
extant in the present day.

Aside from giving rise to a whole bunch of legends and to fueling the occasional
would-be despot's ambitions, the most enduring legacy of Atlantis was its
engineering. They pioneered a lot of the techniques that are used today to make
sturdy weapons and tools out of implausible aquatic materials like shell, coral,
and mother-of-pearl. They were also the first civilization to successfully
make and work orichalcum.

In many worlds, present-day techniques for working these materials are more
advanced than Atlantean ones, but they can still trace their "lineage" back to
the lost empire. In others Atlantean techniques remain the state of the art, of
were even lost to time.

Orichalcum is a material present in the core rules. Rules for shell and
mother-of-pearl items can be found in GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 8: Treasure
Tables. Coral items can be found [here][2]. But we're not here to talk about
_stuff_, we're here to talk about _people_.

## So Let's Talk About People

Opinions differ on whether Atlantis was a Golden Age utopia or a despotic empire
whose downfall was a blessing to the world, but everyone agrees it was pretty
cosmopolitan. Unlike most typical dungeon fantasy kingdoms, its citizens
belonged to many different species with none of them making up an overwhelming
majority of the population.

Many of Atlantis' citizens can be described using already-published stats. Sea
Elves and Water-Infused from GURPS DF 3: The Next Level fit very well, as do the
Argonians from [this post][3]. The octopus- and shark-folk from GURPS Banestorm
are also good fits, though they're a bit more complex and costly than the
standard for DF racial templates.

Below are a few new templates, with the overall goal of allowing a diverse
all-underwater party if the group wants to play that type of campaign. A couple
of the new ancestries I present here might have equivalent official templates
already, but since I don't have those I'm writing new ones for my own use.


### Atlantean (20 points)

This template describes people who are a product of successive generations of
intermarriage between the different species that made up the population of
Atlantis. They are known as "Atlanteans" because their general look became
associated with that empire.

The vast majority of Atlanteans look a lot like humans, even when they have no
humans in their ancestry. They're warm-blooded, have legs, can breathe both air
and water, and exhibit the same wide ethnic variance as humans. Individuals can
have a variable number of "fishy" traits like visible gills, fins, blue or gray
skin, and so on. These might be visually striking but are never significant
enough to count as more than 0-point features.

A given world might have an Atlantean population that can trace their ancestry
back to actual Atlantis. They could even appear in worlds that never had an
Atlantis at all, but whose underwater peoples are usually friendly with each
other. The base stats could also be used as they are or modified a bit to
represent any species of underwater humanoid.

**Advantages**: Amphibious {10}, Gills {10}.

**Other Traits**: Those fishy bits might count as varying levels of Unnatural
Features in a setting where almost everyone is human and the character is the
only known Atlantean, but in all other situations they're 0-point traits. If the
character has something like rigid fins or a prominent tail growing out of their
back, they might need adapted body armor. This doesn't cost extra, but might
restrict their usage of looted armor.

### Crab-Folk (45 points)

Crab-folk are sapient humanoid crustaceans easily distinguished by their heavy
segmented carapaces. Like crabs, they lack distinct heads and their eyes are
located at the end of a pair of flexible, retractable stalks. Unlike crabs, they
only have the usual complement of humanoid limbs, though these are still
armored.

Crab-folk can operate normally on the surface, but their gills begin to dry out
if they go more than a day without being immersed in sea water. This means they
tend to stick close to the coast.

**Advantages**: 360-degree Vision {25}; Amphibious {10}; Gills {10}; Damage
Resistance 5 (Cannot Wear Armor) {15}; No Neck {5};

**Disadvantages**: Cold-Blooded {-5}; Dependency (Sea water, Daily) {-15}.

**Optional Traits**: If your campaign takes place far from a coastal area, the
Dependency disadvantage is worth -30 points, and the template therefore costs
only 30. Your local alchemist can prepare a solution close enough to seawater to
satisfy the requirement, but it's still not free.

### Deep Ones (50 points)

These humanoids are much more obviously "fishy" than Atlanteans, with an anatomy
closer to that of an abyssal fish than a human's. They're adapted to the
lightless depths of the ocean and that's where they prefer to make their
homes. Deep Ones can swim up to the shallows without suffering ill effects, but
can't breathe air. After Atlantis fell, it was not uncommon for its Deep One
settlements to become more isolated and break contact with shallower or surface
communities. This some times gave rise to sinister legends and rumors about what
they got up to down there.

**Advantages**: Amphibious {10}, Dark Vision {25}, Fangs {2}, Gills {0},
Pressure Support 3 {15}, Tough Skin 1 {3}.

**Disadvantages**: Cold-Blooded {-5}.


### Merfolk (20 points)

Merfolk are humanoid from the waist up and have fish bodies from the waist
down. They can breathe both air and water and have naturally melodious voices,
but they require magic or assistive devices to operate on land. Their human
halves display the same variance as Atlanteans, and their fish halves can
resemble a variety of species of fish, shark, or cetacean.

**Advantages**: Gills {10}, Voice {10}.

**Disadvantages**: No Legs (Aquatic) {0}.

**Features**: The "Leg" and "Foot" hit locations on merfolk refer to their tail
and lower fins instead. Armor for those locations must be specially
constructed. As usual this doesn't cost extra but limits which looted armor they
can use.

**Optional Traits**: If your character's fish half mimics a particularly speedy
species, they might have Enhanced Move 1 (Water) for an extra 20 points. At the
GM's option, this might be a matter of training instead of biology, which means
the character can buy this with earned points during a campaign.

## A note on Underwater Advantages

In the writeups above I assume that any trait that lets someone move freely
underwater also allow them to see and hear unimpeded, and that any trait that
lets one breathe underwater also let them speak normally while
submerged. My intent with this is to make the templates simpler and to let
people play underwater delvers (divers?) without paying too much for it.

Official GURPS rules are a bit more persnickety about this. You need at least
one level of Nictitating Membrane {1/level} to see normally while underwater,
and you need the Speak Underwater {5} advantage to talk and hear others talk. If
you want to follow the official rules more closely, add these two traits to all
templates above, increasing their cost by 6 points.
