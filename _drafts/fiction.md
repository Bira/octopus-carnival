Mother is wearing a kimono today. I'm both surprised and happy that they let
her. The colors she chose go well with the black of the unblinking camera that
looks out from where her face would be, and the garment conceals the gauntness
of the armature beneath its silks.

The others avoid coming here, but I visit as often as I can. I know it's her
looking at me behind the lens, and touching my face with carbon fiber hands just
like she used to do with the ones made of flesh.

We sit across from each other around a small white table in her hospital room. I
can see the thick gray cables trailing from beneath the kimono and snaking their
way towards the sealed medical pod where her real body rests. She asks me about
the others, and an approximation of her voice comes out of the pod's speakers. I
tell her they are well. Describing their continued feelings of horror and
revulsion is unnecessary. Both of us know.
