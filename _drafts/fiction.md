Mother is wearing a kimono today. I'm both surprised and happy that they let
her. The colors she chose go well with the black of the unblinking camera that
looks out from where her face would be, and the garment conceals the gauntness
of the armature beneath its silks.

The others avoid coming here, but I visit as often as I can. I know it's her
looking at me behind the lens, and touching my face with carbon fiber hands just
like she used to do with the ones made of flesh.

We sit across from each other around a small white table in her hospital room. I
can see the thick gray cables trailing from beneath the kimono and snaking their
way towards the sealed medical pod where her original body rests. She asks me
about the others, and an approximation of her voice comes out of the pod's
speakers. I tell her they are well. Describing their continued feelings of
horror and revulsion is unnecessary. Both of us know.

To them the pod is an aberration that only prolongs the inevitable. They refuse
to see she is still alive. I talk with Mother about trivial things, how I'm
doing at work, books she's been reading, the nice weather outside her window. I
can almost feel our minds dancing around the specter between us, and the dance
itself tells us everything we need to know. They want to shut her down.

Too soon, visiting time is over. I say my goodbyes, get up from my chair and
begin heading towards the door. Mother reaches for my sleeve with her carbon
fiber hand, stopping me for a second. The camera looks at me, then dips downward
in a discreet nod. I nod back, and leave, trying my hardest to hold back a
smile. She finally agreed with my plan. I will be very busy in the next days.
