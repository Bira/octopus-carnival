As I write this, I've just finished writing all of the articles of my [Let's
Read series on the Monster Manual 2][1]. So now I'm going to start on the
Monster Manual 3!

The Monster Manual 3 is obviously the third big monster book for Dungeons &
Dragons 4th Edition, and it was published in June 2010, about a year after the
MM2.

A lot of the stuff I've written on the intro to the MM2 linked above also
applies to the MM3. Monster roles remain the same, as does the gradation that
goes from Minion to Regular to Elite to Solo. The encounter design system is the
same as well.

Some things have changed dramatically, though! While you still have the lore
tables with skill DCs, the surrounding flavor text has gotten a lot bigger,
replacing the minimalist sentences of past books with larger paragraphs written
in a more dramatic tone. The extra space taken up by this text means we no
longer have sample encounters.

The stat blocks themselves also changed a lot, with monster abilities separated
and listed according to the type of action they use (passive traits, standard,
move, minor, immediate/free, always in that order).

Last but not least, the math for basic monster numbers has finally reached its
final, fully fixed form. Attacks, defenses, HP and average damage all follow the
basic formula in the legendary [Monster Manual 3 in a Business Card][2]
post. This updated math was also published as an errata update to the Dungeon
Master's Guide, but the Business Card has it in even more condensed
form. Chronologically, this is the first book where you wouldn't need to apply
any blanket fixes to monster damage.

If you were following my Let's Read posts while reading the actual books, you'll
be familiar with all of these changes from the Monster Vault, which I read in
parallel with the first MM [here][3]. The MV would be published in November
2010, updating the most "iconic" monsters from the first two books to the new
format and collecting some from this one as well.

The Monster Vault would in turn be followed by "Monster Vault: Threats to the
Nentir Vale", the final monster book I intend to cover in my readings. But
that's still a ways away. For now, we look to the MM3.

This book has monsters of all levels, but focuses a bit more on the higher
end. The index in my PDF copy is a little wonky because it lists each individual
stat block in alphabetic order, but I'll still read them in the order in which
the larger entries appear.

The changes in math also mean that monsters are much less likely to have healing
powers. Leader monsters from the MM3 are much more likely to provide combat
buffs than to heal their allies.
