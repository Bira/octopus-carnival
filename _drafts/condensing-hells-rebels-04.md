title: "Condensing Hell's Rebels: Volume 4"

Early modules in a Pathfinder adventure path tend to be full of filler, since
their main job is to get the PCs to a level where they can challenge the
adventure's actual villains and not just their underlings fifty steps down the
hierarchy.

This Hell's Rebels module is when we start to actually challenge those
villains. It's also special because its end makes a very good stopping point for
the campaign if you don't want to deal with the "epic tier" stuff that comes
next.

## District Missions

If you _like_ the whole Assassin's Creed feel of going into special delves to
take control of districts and steadily progressing towards the rebellion's main
goal, then there's little you can cut here. Most of these delves are short,
consisting of one big fight, and the enjoyment you would derive from doing them
is worth it.

If you do want to streamline this part, you can remove the following missions:

- **Rescue Hetamon**: Maybe Hetamon didn't even get kidnapped in the first
  place, and his demon mom never showed up. Taking this district just requires
  murdering a generic captain, something which allied NPCs backed by Raven teams
  can handle on their own.

- **Take the Records Hall**: The witch Tiarise was only ever mentioned before as
  foreshadowing during the tooth fairy mission in Adventure 1. And since we've
  cut that one out, we can cut her from here without losing much. The only
  reason to keep this mission around is if you also want to include her undead
  self in adventure 6.

- **Bleakbridge**: The opponents here are all generic. The important bit here is
  not the fight against them, but the negotiation to bring the River Talons on
  board. You can say that if the negotiation succeeds the Talons take care of
  the blockade by themselves... or you can remove this scene entirely and say
  the negotiation was handled entirely by allied NPCs.

- **Skinsaw Assassins**: These are a roving threat and are a good callback to
  include if Hei-Fen made a strong impression in them back in
  adventure 3. Otherwise you can remove them, since their job here is to show up
  when it's most inconvenient and delay progress.

On the other hand I recommend _keeping_ the following missions:

- **The Dragon**: Fighting a dragon is kind of a dungeon fantasy rite of
  passage. Kill it and you earn your Certificate of Badassitude.

- **Kintargo Keep**: This one is still relatively short but leads to the rescue
  of Jackdaw, who is one of the most important NPCs in the campaign's
  backstory. It feels right for the PCs to be present for that.

- **The Temple of Asmodeus**: We can't really remove the capstone dungeon for
  the module... but we still can streamline it. Let the PCs have the temple map
  automatically. Maybe an offscreen covert op succeeded, or maybe it was in the
  Records Hall. Point out where the entry points and infernal engines are, and
  have an NPC point out the optimal route if the PCs didn't think of it.

  The boss fights in here are still going to be formidably hard, but this will
  let the PCs bypass most of the "trash fights".
