The Barbarian is our first template because they're listed in alphabetical
order. Like the D&D Barbarian, this one is a beefy raider from some far-off
region whose culture the campaign's dominant society finds a bit strange. Unlike
that other barbarian, however the Dungeon Fantasy Barbarian is _not_ necessarily
"the angry one".

Barbarians are big beefy fighters with big personalities, and have wilderness
survival skills compatible with their home region. These skills make them very
valuable party members in wilderness-focused adventures and campaigns, and their
combat skills are useful everywhere.

## Basic Stats

Barbarians start with ST 17, DX 13, IQ 10, and HT 13. They also start with HP
increased to 22, Perception increased to 12, and Basic Speed decreased to 6.00.

Their starting strength and HP makes them by far the strongest and toughest
delvers in our lineup. Due to a rule we'll see in the Campaigns book, that 22 HP
also means any healing applied to the barbarian counts double. They're not just
hard to kill, they're also easy to heal.

High HP should never be your only defense, and the Barbarian does have
others. However, there are things out there that can bypass everything else, so
it's still nice to have.

## Advantages

All barbarians have High Pain Threshold {10} and Outdoorsman 2 {20}. The first
helps a lot with reducing pain-based penalties, particularly when you take
damage. The other is a Talent that enhances outdoorsy survival
skills.

They can also spend 40 points on buying more advantages from a list displayed
here. I won't go over them one by one, but they fall into a few
categories beyond the standard "increased stats plus Luck":

- Stuff that makes you tougher, both against HP damage and against the sort of
  Bad Stuff that demands resistance rolls.

- Stuff that lets you fight better, an ironically small category for
  barbarians. Most of their combat effectiveness comes from their raw strength
  and high weapon skill, not from special powers.

- Stuff that makes them even better at outdoor survival. Of note is further
  increasing Outdoorsman up to the maximum level of 6, letting them improve
  survival skills as if they had IQ 16, Per 18, or DX 19. Improving this talent
  during is always a better deal in terms of points than improving the
  individual skills.

## Disadvantages

All barbarians have Social Stigma (Minority Group) {-10}. This gives them a
penalty to reactions from others in social situations and is due to the
differences between the barbarian's culture and the one where the campaign takes
place. If the campaign is in the Barbarian's homeland, of course, you can remove
this and replace it with -10 points in other disadvantages from the template's
customization tables.

There are two here: a small one with further traits for more accentuated
cultural differences (such as Gullible, a fear of machinery, or reduced starting
wealth). And a large one of stereotypical barbarian personality traits, for
those who want to have gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth.

## Skills

Barbarians start with either skill 18 in a two-handed weapon, or skill 16 in a
one-handed weapon and in shields. This is pretty high by core GURPS standards,
and it's what you need if you want to attack every turn with little in the way
of setup. It also gives you a pretty decent Parry defense in melee.

They also get one ranged weapon skill, which could be the ability to throw their
melee weapon depending on that choice. Like every delver, they also get some
emergency unarmed combat skills.

After that you have a selection of outdoor survival skills, many of which are
covered by the Outdoorsman talent.

## Special Barbarian Traits

Barbarians can buy strength up to 25 and HP up until 1/2 of their ST (not just
1/3). Other Barbarian-only traits include:

- **Discriminatory Smell** lets you have Wolverine's nose. You can memorize
  scents and recognize them later, get a big bonus to both smell-based
  Perception rolls and the Tracking skill.

- **Lifting ST**: You can lift even more than your already impressive strength
  indicates. Add this to ST to determine your Basic Lift and general feats of
  strength, but not your damage or HP.

- **Temperature Tolerance**: In Cold and Heat versions, this gives a bonus to
  resist temperature related effects. This is how Conan can walk shirtless in
  the snow. You can have up to three levels of both.

- **Tough Skin**: Adds to your damage resistance as if it was armor! It's still
  flesh, though, so it doesn't protect the eyes and doesn't work against attacks
  that just require skin contact or a small scratch to take effect. Barbarians
  can have up to 3 levels. It _does_ stack with worn armor.

## Customization Notes

The book has some example archetypes here to guide players who don't quite know
which traits to pick from the template.

The _angry one_ might pair Berserk and Bloodlust with the traits that make them
tougher. Note that Berserk is a major disadvantage, not a superpower. A
_survivalist_ has more Per and Outdoorsman, traits like Discriminatory Smell,
and disadvantages like reduced Wealth and illiteracy. A _wilderness guardian_
might be Fearless and an Animal Friend, but also Overconfident and burdened with
a Sense of Duty to Nature.

Weapon and survival skills should match the feel of barbarian's origin
culture. A viking could have Spear and Shield, plus Survival (Arctic),
Seamanship, and Skiing, for example.

ST 17 or more means any weapon is effective in the hands of a barbarian, so they
can save some money by taking something big and relatively cheap like a spear,
axe or mace. Swords are expensive!
