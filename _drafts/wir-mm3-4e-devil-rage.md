Looks like the Monster Manual 3 is all about blurring the lines between
fiends. We have a devil who became a demon lord, demons who became devils, and
now a devil who behaves like a demon. I haven't run into rage devils before. If
they appeared in previous editions, it must have been in a late MM or a
specialized supplement.

## The Lore

A Rage Devil is what happens when you take a standard Hell Knight and inject
demon ichor into it. They're hulking brutes who are constantly angry and delight
in carnage. In other words, they're pretty much demons, or they would be if
their flesh wasn't bound with empowered Supernal sigils that keep them pointed
in the right direction.

These creatures are the result of an infernal experiment to create more powerful
shock troops to throw into the meatgrinder of the Blood War. They're actually a
little weaker than a standard hell knight, so we should probably say that they
adapted the process to work on legion devils instead.

Rage devils are used as heavy elements attached to legion devil forces, and are
often placed under the command of hell knights. In their free time, these things
roam Avernus in search of demon stragglers or anyone else they can get away with
smashing.

## The Numbers

Rage Devils are Large Immortal Humanoids (Devils), and Level 11 Brutes with 138
HP. They have Darkvision and Resist Fire 20, but they can't fly. Their ground
speed is 6.

These devils are heavily armored and fight with **Disrupting Mauls** whose basic
attacks strip all of the target's resistances for a turn! They have a special
technique named **Demonscourge Crush** (recharge 4+), which deals the same
damage as a basic attack, weakens, and strips all resistances (save ends
both). Another maneuver is **Maul Storm** an at-will Close Burst 2 that deals
some damage and pushes targets 3 squares. If they're bloodied, they're also
knocked prone.

Their **Blood Rage** passive trait makes them deal extra damage on all attacks
against bloodied opponents.

## Final Impressions

Rage devils are indeed an excellent weapon both against demons and against other
devils, as well as any creature type that relies on high elemental
resistances. Behavior-wise they tend to be on the shallower end of the _demon_
cliche pool, with only their binding rituals preventing them from turning on
their devilish masters.

As I said above, I'd probably say most rage devils are modified legion devils,
because baseline Hell Knights are both stronger and smarter than these things,
so turning a Hell Knight into a Rage Devil is a net strategic loss.
