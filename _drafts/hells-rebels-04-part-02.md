Before I launch into a description of the final part of this adventure, I think
it's useful to go over some background information.

## Barzilai's Master Plan

As mentioned waaay back in the first parts of this series, Barzilai Thrune's
master plan is to become a "genius loci", a powerful spirit tied to a specific
place. This would make him epic-level and immortal, an eternal feature of the
area where Kintargo now stands. He used a ritual given to him by Mephistopheles
for the purpose - he enacted it somewhere in Adventure 02.

The ritual had him remove his own heart and tie his life essence to the
land. Barzilai will become a genius loci after he dies of natural causes, having
lived the whole remainder of his natural life in the region. Those details are
very important, as is typical on diabolical contracts. Should Barzilai die
before his appointed time, he will spend the intervening years being tortured in
Hell before he can become an epic level spirit. So you can see why he's very
interested in preserving his life at this moment.

As soon as he sees he's lost the upper hand in the rebellion (at Authority 0),
the dictator will turtle up in the Temple of Asmodeus, and will order its high
priest to enact a ritual to contact Mephistopheles directly. The ritual takes
three days and a lot of sacrifices to complete, and when it does Mephistopheles
answers by sending _six pit fiends_ to serve Barzilai and by giving him and all
his underlings a major boost in stats that's going to last for a whole
month. Sou you can see why the PCs should be very interested in stopping this
and killing Barzilai as fast as possible. This is why the final part of this
adventure is an assault on the temple.

## The Song of Silver

Fortunately, after completing all the missions in Part 01 of this adventure, the
PCs should have eliminated some of Barzilai's main goons and acquired everything
they need to perform the Song of Silver: the score, the lyrics, and control of
the Opera House.

The Song of Silver is a ritual developed by the original Silver Ravens. It must
be performed on stage at the Kintargo Opera House, though it doesn't really
require an audience beyond the PCs and maybe some of their main allies. It's
short, taking only one minute to sing, and requires a skill test that should by
now be pretty easy for any bard in the party. Shensen can also sing it if there
are none.

As soon as it completes, the dome of the opera house shines with a bright light
and the whole city is enveloped in a protective dome has a whole bunch of
interesting effects and lasts for seven days. While it's active, all weapons in
the city count as being made of silver, and all evil outsiders must succeed at a
moderately difficult caster level check to teleport or use similar
abilities. The performer, every other PC, and up to four additional allies also
gain a major bonus on saves against charm and compulsion effects, and become
completely immune to fear. They can choose to end this blessing to automatically
pass a save, or to gain the effects of the _breath of life_ spell (which yes,
can return them to life if they die).

The song can only be performed once a month - the PCs should ideally only need
to perform it once. When it's performed for the first time, Barzilai's Authority
is reduced by 15 if that happens while that's still an issue. It would be
optimal if the PCs went into the Temple while under the effects of the Song, as
it makes the assault much easier.

They can also use rebellion actions to obtain a full map of the temple, and to
sabotage the evil ritual, making it take twice as long to complete and slightly
penalizing the priests involved. This gives them more time.

## The Temple of Asmodeus

The temple is a very large round building. It used to be dedicated to Aroden but
was converted to the worship of Asmodeus when House Thrune took over
Kintargo. The Asmodeans sacrificed all the remaining priests of the dead god
back then, turning them into undead that hang around the temple and help defend
it. In addition to this atrocious contingent, the place is as heavily fortified
as its current occupants could make it.

The entrance doors are trapped with a glyph that can send a PC directly to Hell
if not dispelled or disarmed. Interior doors are made of iron and all possesses
magic locks that activate as soon as they're closed, and can only be opened via
Dispel Magic or by the touch of an unholy symbol held by a genuine worshipper of
Asmodeus. Personally, I'd let the party rogue employ Use Magic Device to fake
being one. The walls are all treated with the same magic that protects the
Record Hall, making attempts to break through them or pass through with magic
very unproductive.

In addition to this there are several temple-wide magical effects in place,
powered by two "Infernal Engines" that can be disabled.

The temple's interior is dominated by a huge central nave, a wide open space
where the ritual is being conducted. Surrounding it is a large number of side
rooms, both on the ground floor and on a large balcony on the second
floor. Above that is the bellfry, which is a mini-dungeon all on its own.

When the PCs enter the nave they will probably be spotted right away by the
ritual-casting group: that's high priest Corinstian Grivenner and his ten
helpers (five priests, five devils) plus the city's allied high priest of
Zon-Khuton (the shadow-and-torture god) who's there to protect them. They will
immediately raise a general alarm that brings every other defender of the temple
there.

A less suicidal approach is to sneak into and explore the side rooms, which
allow the PCs to attack the residents when they're in isolated little groups. I
think only Grivenner himself can raise a truly general alarm. However, every
time the PCs finish a fight the temple's bells accumulate a bit more infernal
power (1d6 points). When they accumulate 10 points they ring and inflict a
random bad effect from a table on the PCs.

The Song of Silver's blessing will do a lot to make these harmless, but it's
also in their interests to stop those bells. Disabling the infernal engines
makes this happen less often, but does not stop them.
