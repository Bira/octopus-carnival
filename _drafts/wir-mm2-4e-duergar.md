Chronologically, the first appearance of Duergar in 4e is in the Monster Manual
2, but they were also in the Monster Vault so we covered their basic lore
[here][2]. In this post, we'll covered the duergar that appeared in the MM2 but
weren't updated in the MV.

## Previously on Octopus Carnival...

For your information, these are the duergar entries we covered [previously][2]:
Scout, Guard, Thug, Raid Leader, Infernal Consort, and Devil-Bred Duergar.

This still leaves us with a sizable selection of stat blocks that didn't make it
into the Monster Vault. They include some elite warrior types, and several
Hell-themed spellcasters that resemble either warlocks or clerics.

As we saw in that earlier post, all duergar share two signature traits:
resistance to fire and poison that increases with their level, and the ability
to shoot out their Infernal Quills at someone, once per fight as a minor
action. This has a Range of 3, does light physical damage and a tiny bit of
ongoing poison damage. It also inflicts a -2 penalty to attack rolls. A single
save ends both the ongoing damage and the attack penalty.

## Duergar Theurge

Theurges are Level 5 Controllers with 63 HP. They wear robes and fight with
**warhammers** in melee. At range they fling **Hellbolts** (ranged 10
vs. Reflex) that do fire damage.

They also have a bunch of stronger spells they can use less often. **Brimstone
Hail** (recharge 5-6) does fire damage over a fireball-sized area and knocks
targets prone on a hit. **Vile Fumes** (recharges when first bloodied) does
poison damage over the same area and blinds for a turn on a hit. And **Wave of
Despair** is a daily blast 5 vs. Will and does psychic damage, slows, and dazes
(save ends both).
