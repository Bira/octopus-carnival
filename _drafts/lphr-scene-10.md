# [GM] Intro

Looks like doing one strategic turn and one mission takes long enough that I
should split each of these into a separate scene. So here we'll do the second
week of our strategic layer then find something else to do as a mission.

# [GM] Mythic Bookkeeping

Let's increase the Chaos Factor to 6.

We mark a step on Get Organized, and will consider that done once we have moved
to a permanent base. And let's give 1 CP to everyone for it. Rosalia gets a step
in her Find Shensen quest, because last mission advanced this a bit. I know they
already got another CP out of the associated challenge, but let's give them
anothero ne for the step.

**Threads**

## [GM] ~Record Scratch Sound~ Wait A Minute!

Looking at the recordings for last scene reminded me of something, and I want to
deal with that right now.

There are many occasions where the original adventure path kinda gatekeeps
developments behind level or (more arbitrarily) story progression.

Sometimes, an early book will provide an answer to a mystery the PCs are
investigating. For example, book 1 tells the GM Shensen has been turned to stone
and is being kept in the opera house, but at level 2 the Pathfinder PCs lack
both the abilitles to locate her and the raw power to break into the place,
since it's being used as Thrune's personal fortress. The book tells us they'll
have both by the end of Volume 3.

Other times, a bit of information is outright retconned in a later book. The
later book introduces new information that was impossible to discover earlier
because _it wasn't true_ back then.

One example of that is Shensen's music shop! In the previous scene, which is
from Volume 1, we are told that both the shop and its basement are completely
collapsed. But in volume 4 we learn that there's an entire intact section of the
basement that gets turned into an eight-room dungeon by the villains of the
hour. And it's also occupied by Shensen's sapient dinosaur friend, who's hiding
out.

Now, Volume 4 says that both the villains and the dinosaur moved in "several
weeks" before the day in which the PCs finally delve into the dungeon, but those
chambers should still be there! They even have a tunnel leading from the surface
to an only partially collapsed room right at the end, that could conceivably be
found by PCs before then.

We don't know how many weeks away from that scene we are yet, but it's probably
more than "several". Let's say they move in somewhere during Adventure 3 when
the PCs are out of town. So in Adventure 1, that hasn't happened yet.

What _has_ happened is the Night of Ashes, when Thrune agents raided and torched
the place. Some bits of description in Volume 4 makes me think they were in kind
of a hurry, as there was a lot going on that night. They gained entrance to the
secret basement, kidnapped Shensen, and looted the place of its obvious
valuables, but didn't stop to ritually desecrate the shrine area, figuring the
fire would destroy it.

So this is how things in there should be in Adventure 1:

A1 - Tainted Reservoir : The slime naga and its oozes are already here. They're
said to have moved in shortly after the Night of Ashes.

A2 - Secret Entrance: Nothing here, as always.

A3 - Shensen's Bedroom: The bedroom is empty of creatures. The secret
compartiment in the armoire still has all the listed treasure, which belongs to
Shensen and not to the monsters.

A4 - Corrupted Chapel: This chapel is not corrupted yet, and it's completely
deserted. No monsters here.

A5 - Chapel Vault: The vault is still ransacked, as that's said to have happened
during the Night of Ashes. It's also deserted, as Hetamon Haace hasn't been
captured.

A7 - Dawnflower Font: The font is still consecrated and operational!

A8 - Ruined Chambers: Still ruined, and deserted since Gut-Tugger hasn't moved
in yet. There's a tunnel linking it to the surface ruins, which the PCs can only
find at the GM's sufferance even in Volume 4.

Do I let them find the place? They did spend an hour searching the ruins.

In Adventure 4, all of the DCs to find hidden stuff in here are are around
25-35. PCs are supposed to be level 10 when they get here. A "party radar"
character might have started with Wisdom 18, increased it to 20 at levels 4 and
8, grabbed the Alertness feat at some point, and put points in Perception all
the way from level 1, meaning they have 13 ranks in the skill. That's a +20
bonus. DC 25 requires a 5+, DC 30 a 10+, DC 35 a 15+.

According to our ad-hoc conversion, those difficulties would be a -6, -8, or -10
to Perception or Observation, and to get approximately the same chances of
success we'd need someone with a 18 in either of those. Our top scores are 14
currently, for Jania, Urist, and Rosalia. Jade has a 12, Arcturus a 10. Let's
say the passage to A8 could be spotted with a check at -8 (equivalent to DC
30). So that's three rolls vs. 6, and one vs 4. Do any of our heroes manage to
sequence break?

Nope, the best roll is a 9.

So in theory this was all just a little fun exercise that didn't lead to
anything... but maybe those penalties are too harsh? D&D scaling difficulty kind
of assumes that the skill in question keeps increasing, but that might not be
the case at all.

Looking to the DF 2: Exploits a "genuinely difficult" adventuring task is a -4
or -5. Let's do -4, the same difficulty of finding the treasure box. This is a
separate, secret, and free roll that they make alongside the ones for searching
for clues.

Everyone still fails when the penalty is a -4, as I'm not rerolling. But this
does give me some food for thought when it comes to difficulties for future
tests. We'll get to this in Adventure 4, I guess.

## Upkeep Phase

At the start of our turn, Rexus reduces its Notoriety by 1, to 0.

Step 1 - Unmodified **Loyalty** check. Rosalia will attempt all of her three
complimentary skills here. Success on all 3, we roll against 15. Normal success,
so we lose "only" 1d6 supporters. That's 3, so we're at 11.

Step 2 - Our Notoriety is zero, nothing to do here.

Step 3 - Our treasury is fine.

Step 4 - We're still beyond the Rank 2 supporter threshold, so we level up!

That means we increase our focus trait by +1, have 2 rebellion actions per turn,
and grant the Training +1 boon to all our PCs. That means they get to put 4 CP
any one skill.

- Arcturus adds them to his Karate, increasing it to DX+1. He punches better but
  is still more or less dead weight in the strategy layer.

- Jade buys Intelligence Analysis, which is bolstered by Born War Leader.

- Jania buys Administration. The woes of command.

- Rosalia buys Area Knowledge for Kintargo, this was already supposed to be her
  thing.

- I'll let Urist split his 4 points: 2 into Administration, 1 into Public
  Speaking, 1 into Religious Ritual.

## Activity Phase

We have two standard actions and one bonus action from having a Strategist.

Let's start with the **Recruit Team** action, to recruit a team of
Sneaks. That's an unpenalized Secrecy roll, and it gets +2 from Laria, and a
total of +4 from Jania (one of her complimentary rolls was a crit). We get a
crit here too, but I don't think that has an effect.

(2025-12-22)

The other action is **Gather Information**, using the Crow Sisters as the acting
team. It's Secrecy -2, but all the bonuses from team tier and Jania's
complimentary skills bump this to an effective 17. We want to know about
Shensen.

And we roll a 18!

Not only was this a failure, but it also increases our notoriety by 1d6
== 4. Now I see why these jokers were run out of their former town, they draw a
lot of unwanted attention.

We'll use our bonus action to Recruit Supporters. Loyalty, +2 because Laria is
here, +1 from Rexus' Administration. A normal success, meaning we recruit 2d6+4
supporters (rank 2, 2 recruiters). That's 14, taking us to 25!

## Event Phase

Okay, we're now in the Event Phase. Our base chance of an event is 24%, but it's
doubled to 48% because we had no events last turn. We roll a 13, so we get an
event. The Danger Rating for the city is 20, so we need to roll 1d100+20 on the
provided table.

That's the **Rivalry** event. Two of our teams develop a rivalry and neither of
them can be used in the next Activity phase. It makes sense for these to be the
Crow Sisters and our newly-hired Sneaks. And this is actually super bad for our
rebellion!

One of our Officers can make a
social skill test to mitigate this and end the rivalry before it can do damage
to our operations. I'll say it's a **Leadership** issue, and that **Diplomacy**
or **Intimidation** can act as complimentary skills here. This is an event, so
our sentinel Jade is going to handle it.

I'm going to say the check is at -2, but Jade has Leadership-17 so we're still
doing pretty well here. We succeed, the event is mitigated, and the doubling of
the chance goes away for next turn.

# [GM] This Week's Mission

What should I throw at myself this time? Let's take a look at what's available.

- Mission 1, Decoding the Documents: Ongoing, we're at week 2/7.

- Mission 2, Investigating the Fires: We did this one on Week 1.

- Mission 3, Prisoners of Salt: We did this one on Week _0_.

- Mission 4, Murders in the Nursery: This might be a good candidate, but I would
  not run it as written.

  We have a total of three instances of "Did the Temple Hill Slasher somehow
  return from the dead?" missions. This one, another one in Adventure 2 where
  it's a copycat, and one way into Adventure 5 where he really does return. I
  don't believe we need to tease this return quite so many times, so instead I'm
  pulling the adventure 2 mission here.
