If there's one thing that D&D doesn't lack, it's monstrous spiders. The Monster
Manual gave us a bunch of them; the Monster Vault would update some of these and
add new ones. The Monster Manual 2, published between those two books, adds a
whole new batch that doesn't overlap with either of the other books.

All of the spiders here have Tremorsense 10 and a climb speed enhanced by the
Spider Climb trait, which allows them to walk on ceilings. They also have a Web
Walker trait that allows them to ignore difficult terrain caused by
webs. Finally, they have the very obvious Spider keyword, which allows them to
be affected by all those drow and ettercap abilities that benefit "spider
allies".

## Bristle Spider

These elephant-sized arachnids were originally bred by oni to serve as their
mounts. In our narrative present, several other peoples have adopted them as
well. Their biggest fans are the ettercap and the drow, neither of which have
ever met a spider monster they didn't like.

Bristle spiders can also be found in the wild, where they inhabit dense jungles
and caves. These environments tend to have enough cover to allow even these huge
monsters to hide effectively and ambush their prey.

Bristle Spiders are Huge Natural Beasts, and Level 15 Elite Lurkers with 232
HP. They have a ground speed of 8 and a climb speed of 6. I don't know if they
make webs themselves, but they still have Web Walker. As lurkers, they're
trained in Stealth.

Their basic attack is a venomous **Bite** that deals damage with slow and
ongoing poison damage riders. They can also spit an **Acidic Poison Spray** in a
Close Blast 5. This targets reflex and deals both instant and ongoing "acid and
poison" damage, and also slows.

Those bristles are also useful in combat as part of the **Bristle Blast** attack
(recharge 4+). This is a minor action, Close Blast 5 attack against
Fortitude. It deals no damage, but a hit blinds and dazes the target for a turn.

Despite being an elite, the bristle spider lacks a double attack
ability. Instead it relies on its at-will acidic poison blast to hit multiple
PCs per attack, with a side order of bristles to keep them vulnerable. It would
probably work better as an elite controller than an elite lurker, with more HP
and better AC.

The sample encounter is level 14 and has a bristle spider acting as a palanquin
for a drow priestess and her drow blademaster bodyguard.

## Phase Spider

A returning classic, Phase Spiders have undergone some changes to account for
the absence of an Ethereal plane in 4e. Here, they're fey spiders with innate
teleportation powers. They were originally created by the eladrin as biological
weapons meant to infiltrate the halls of the drow and wreak havoc inside. It's a
spider arms race!

These spiders can survive nearly anywhere as long as they have prey to
hunt. Their favorite targets are fey creatures, to the extent that they'll go
after the fey members of a mixed-origin party even if a non-fey target would be
more advantageous. This behavior was probably an attempt by eladrin wizards to
get them to go after drow. You can imagine how that turned out.

Phase Spiders are Large Fey Beasts, and Level 8 Skirmishers with 87 HP. They
have ground, climb, and _teleport_ speeds of 6. Good luck pinning them down.

Their **bites** deal somewhat low damage, but have a dangerous rider: targets
are initially slowed, but after the first failed save they become
unconscious. This is also a (save ends) condition, but the victim is completely
unable to act while it lasts _and_ is even more vulnerable to attack than if
they were "just" stunned.

**Ethereal Bite** allows the spider to teleport 10 squares and make a bite
attack, working as a good ambush starter. **Ethereal Repulsion** is an interrupt
that triggers when an enemy moves adjacent to the spider: it attacks their Will
and teleports them 4 squares on a hit.

This makes ranged attacks the best way to deal with phase spiders. They, in
turn, will eagerly teleport to the party's back line and munch on the squishies,
relying on Ethereal Repulsion to delay any rescue by the melee defenders.

The sample encounter is level 7 and features two eladrin fey knights leading a
pack of three trained phase spiders.

## Tomb Spider

These rotund arachnids are a Shadowfell species that has particularly strong
incentives to seek out passages into the world. Their lifecycle requires them to
lay eggs inside corpses, so they seek out crypts and graveyards for use as
breeding grounds.

When the eggs hatch they animate the corpse, which acts as ambulatory shelter
for the hatchlings until it finally splits open and lets them out. Orcus
cultists just looove tomb spiders, as do all other types of death-themed
villain.

Tomb Spiders are Large Shadow Beasts, and Level 11 Elite Controllers with 226
HP. They have Resist 10 Necrotic, along with ground and climb speeds of 6. Their
**bites** damage, daze, and inflict ongoing necrotic damage (save ends
both). Someone bitten by the spider can't use the Second Wind action until the
end of the encounter, though they can still be healed by other means.

These spiders definitely to spin webs: they can shoot **Web Nets** at single
targets as a minor action (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex). A hit restrains the target and
makes them vulnerable to necrotic damage until they pass a save. Less often,
they can squeeze out a glob of **Webbed Terrain** (recharge 5+), which affects a
large area and immobilizes on a hit. Hit or miss, the webs remain as difficult
terrain until the end of the encounter.

The sample encounter is level 11 and features a deatphriest of orcus leading 2
battle wights and 3 cultists to battle, using the tomb spider as armored
support.

## Tomb Spider Broodswarm

This is a swarm of tiny tomb spiders that has just burst out of their corpse
nest. It's a Medium Shadow Beast (Swarm), and counts as a Level 10 Lurker with
84 HP. It has the standard spider traits from this entry, and the standard swarm
traits of being resistant to melee and ranged attacks, and vulnerable to area
attacks.

Its **Swarm Attack** aura (1) slows those caught inside. Its **Swarm of Bites**
attack is a lesser version of mommy's bite, and instead of attacking it can use
**Shadow Drift** (recharge 5+) to shift shift 5 squares and gain +4 to all
defenses for a turn.

There are no stats for the undead corpse that houses the spiders, but you can
probably use something like a non-royal mummy described as being wrapped in webs
instead of linen wraps. Depending on your tastes, it could be a minion that
disgorges a Broodswarm when killed, a _regular_ that does the same (and thus
counts as an elite two-stage monster), or a regular reskinned mummy if you want
the young swarm to die when it dies instead of bursting out.

No sample encounter here, as the adult tomb spider used the space for it.

## Final Impressions

I kinda like the phase and tomb spider mechanics... but in the end, it's more
spiders. By the end of the edition we'll end up with enough spider variants that
you'll have one for every situation, but you should definitely not use all of
them in the same campaign.
