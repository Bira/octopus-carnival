There's a type of treasure in dungeon fantasy games that I tend to call
"monetary" treasure. It's a catch-all category that includes everything that
doesn't have an immediate use in the dungeon, and which delvers covet primarily
because it's worth money.

The most common form of monetary trasure is... actual money! Piles of glittering
coins is what most delvers imagine when they think of treasure, and the entire
minigame of treasure logistics inherent to the genre tends to use them as a
baseline. Old-school D&D even measured all equipment weight in coins instead of
using real-world units.

The next most common forms are loose gems and jewelry. In old-school D&D their
value could be described as "arbitrary but high". A given gem or piece of
jewelry could be described the same way in two different modules but be given
completely different monetary values. You could however always be sure that
they'd be worth a lot more than their weight in coins, and so they were always a
good find.

Things are a bit more complicated in GURPS. Coins are valued according to their
precious metal content[^1], loose gems according to their composition and
size. Jewelry ends up being a bit more nebulous. And there's the rule that
anything that isn't money is subject to Wealth-based sale prices.


[^1]: These prices used to correspond to reality at some point in the past, but
now they're mostly conventions.
