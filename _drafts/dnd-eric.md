On Earth Eric was a rich spoiled brat, and only the "rich" part has stopped
being true after he was stranded in the Realm. He constantly complains about the
insalubrious nature of the adventuring life, and is much more reluctant to head
into danger than his friends are. At the same time he's quick to fall for
get-home-quick scehemes that the others can see are bad ideas. He does have an
actual heart under all that armor, though, and often saves his friends' lives
with his magic shield. He's 15 years old when the show starts.

According to Mark Evanier, the show's developer, Eric's difficult personality
was mandated by parent's groups and consultants to push the then-dominant moral
lesson that "the group is always right; the complainer is always wrong". Yikes!
Stripped of this context, a lot of his voiced concerns are quite reasonable for
a modern-day Earthling transported to a dangerous fantasy world. His biggest
problem then becomes his blindness to the flaws in his own plans to return home,
which often land him in trouble.

Our version of Eric is a 62-point character. We use the Apprentice Strong Delver
template as a base. Visually it feels like he should be a Knight, but it turns
out that the Knight module is focused on leadership skills, which he doesn't
really have. So instead of adding a "class" module to him we add two upgrade
modules that make him stronger and more skilled at using his shield: Juggernaut
and Stalwart. His disadvantages are custom picks.

While Eric can bash enemies with his shield in a fight, most of his actions will
be purely defensive. His top priority in any dangerous situation is to run away,
which he can do remarkably well for someone wearing a lot of armor. Eric will
only stand his ground when given no other option - this includes when his
friends are in danger. If he does stand his ground, though, he's almost
impossible to hurt, with an amazing Block score of _18_ and all the abilities
the Griffon Shield provides him.

## The Griffon Shield

This metal kite shield is completely indestructible, impervious to magic, and
has a Defense Bonus of 4 despite being the size of a typical medium shield. It's
also supernaturally handy and can be used to block multiple times per turn,
which each block attempt after the first incurring a cumulative -2 penalty.

Once per day the shield can project a force dome with a radius of 2 yards,
centered on the wielder. This ability can be activated as a free action after a
successful block, or with a Concentrate maneuver. The dome can be used to block
large-area attacks and provide shelter to the wielder and their allies, but it
draws on the wielder's energy to sustain itself. It costs 3 FP per minute to
maintain, as if it was a spell.

The -2 cumulative penalty for multiple blocks cannot be further reduced by the
Trained By a Master or Weapon Master advantages.
