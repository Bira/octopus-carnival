Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder's Iconic Characters to
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**! This is the sixth post in the series. Previous
entries can be found here:

Today's template is the Scout which means's that today's character is
Rarsk. Here he is:

Just Look at all that compressed compressed rage! His [bio][7] does give him
plenty to be angry about. Harsk's official stats are [here][8]. From these we
can learn the following:

- Harsk is a Dwarf from Varisia, a "wild frontier" region that doesn't have any
  blatant ties to real-world cultures. He was a bit of an outsider to his own
  stereotypically Dwarven community, and appointed himself a keeper of justice
  in the wild places after his brother was killed by raiding giants.

- He carries his brother's axe with him, but his preferred weapon is a heavy
  crossbow he made himself. Understandably, he has giants as a favored enemy and
  gains bonuses to fight them.

- He's skilled in wilderness survival, particularly in mountains, and very
  perceptive.

This puts us in something of a pickle. DF Scouts are excellent at shooting bows,
but Harsk's preferred weapon is the _crossbow_. While that's much more in line
with the dwarven idiom, it's not supported by the standard Scout template in
**DF 1**. I'm still going to use that template as a base, but I'll need to range
a bit further afield when looking for the right advantages.
