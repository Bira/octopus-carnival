Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder's Iconic Characters to
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**! This is the sixth post in the series. Previous

Today's template is the Scout which means's that today's character is
Harsk. Here he is:

Just Look at all that compressed compressed rage! His [bio][7] does give him
plenty to be angry about. Harsk's official stats are [here][8]. From these we
can learn the following:

- Harsk is a Dwarf from Varisia, a "wild frontier" region that doesn't have any
  blatant ties to real-world cultures. He was a bit of an outsider to his own
  stereotypically Dwarven community, and appointed himself a keeper of justice
  in the wild places after his brother was killed by raiding giants.

- He carries his brother's axe with him, but his preferred weapon is a heavy
  crossbow he made himself. Understandably, he has giants as a favored enemy and
  gains bonuses to fight them.

- He's skilled in wilderness survival, particularly in mountains, and very
  perceptive.

This puts us in something of a pickle. DF Scouts are excellent at shooting bows,
but Harsk's preferred weapon is the _crossbow_. While that's much more in line
with the dwarven idiom, it's not supported by the standard Scout template in
**DF 1**. I'm still going to use that template as a base, but I'll need to range
a bit further afield when looking for the right advantages. More specifically,
the Heroic Crossbowman advantage and the Quick Reload perk, summarized below for
ease of reference.

### Heroic Crossbowman (20 points)

This is just like Heroic Archer, but for crossbows instead of bows. It gives the
same benefits (Acc without an Aim maneuver, eliminates Bulk penalty, halved
Fast-Draw and Quick-Shooting penalties), and also give access to perks from
**GURPS Gun Fu** which make sense for crossbows. This advantage wasn't
explicitly written out anywhere that I could find, but it's trivially derived
from Heroic Archer.

### Quick Reload (1 point)

The crossbow version of this perk requires Heroic Crossbowman and allows you to
reload a crossbow in one turn with a successful Fast-Draw (Arrow) roll. You
_can_ use the quick-shooting rules from the description of Heroic Archer in **DF
1**, p. 14 to attempt to fire your crossbow every turn!

With these traits in hand, statting Harsk up is fairly easy. Being a Scout, he
lacks the spells of his original version, but he scarcely needs them when he can
rely on his incredible marksdwarfship. Harsk's increased Lifting ST from being a
Dwarf also allow him to carry a beefier crossbow, and to be one the only iconics
so far who is at No Encumbrance while carrying his full kit.
