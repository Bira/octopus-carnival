Stop and think for a moment: when was the last time you took part in a proper
battle against a dragon in your RPG campaigns, either as a player or as a GM? By
"proper" battle I mean an encounter which is an actual fight as opposed to a
dialogue scene or a cutscene in disguise. A battle that follows the game's rules
all the way through.

"People who read Octopus Carnival" might not be a very large sample set, but I
bet that even here there's not a lot who have done it in recent memory. If
you're a GM, you probably hesitate to add such a battle to your plans because
dragons are really powerful and your party is surely not ready to face one just
yet. And if you're a player you probably hesitate to go where the dragon is for
pretty much the same reason.

This is what I call Dragon Performance Anxiety. It's not a new phenomenon and
I'm certainly not the first one to talk about this. In fact, I'm writing _this_
because of a post on the same subject I once read on Dungeon Fantastic, and
which for the life of me I can't find the link to.

Let us instead turn to [this post][1] on a blog called Merric's Musings which
discusses another phenomenom I've seen described as "dragon inflation". It's
mostly a D&D thing, but it likely affects you even if you play other games which
include dragons, such as GURPS Dungeon Fantasy or even Shadowrun. So it's time
for a history lesson! I'm actually sorta paraphrasing a much more complete post
I read once, but again I don't remember _where_ I read it. Gotta get my memory
chips replaced, I guess.

You see, back in the olden days of Original D&D, dragons used to be dangerous,
but manageable opponents. The dragons were maybe the size of a horse, and their
hoards could fill a good-sized bathtub. All colors of dragons had about the same
amount of treasure too, so finding a lair tended to prompt a round of risk
assessment rather than a visceral need to run away.

They got a little stronger as time went on, to keep pace with the increased
power of the PCs, until the initial publication of the Forgotten Realms campaign
setting. As usual, Ed Greenwood has a lot to answer for! One of the distinctive
features of the Realms, according to those first books, was that dragons here
were much more powerful. It's from here that you get the image of a
building-sized dragon guarding a hoard the size of Uncle Scrooge's money
bin. And when AD&D Second Edition rolled around, FR dragons became the default.

This was right about when I started playing, so to me dragons were always these
impossibly though monsters that I _might_ get to see if I survive the
multiple-year process of getting from level 1 to level "high enough".

It doesn't matter that the actual rules include dragon stats appropriate for a
sizable chunk of the party's adventurer career. The text encourages GMs to think
of dragons as _special_. Fighting a dragon has to be a Big Deal. In my
experience, the GM's and player's eyes always drift toward the older age
categories of the most powerful dragon colors, and their minds always use that
as a gauge for what a dragon fight should be like. As such, they never quite
think that it's the right time to face a dragon. Either the GM doesn't place one
in the campaign, or they do and the players never work up the nerve to go there.

Third edition didn't to much to dispel these notions, but subsequent editions
tried to make it a little more obvious that you _can_ fight the game's titular
monster before you reach "demigodly superhero" levels of power.

## Dragon Performance Anxiety In Other Systems

Even if you don't play D&D, you've probably felt something similar to what I
described above. There's a whole lot of fantasy systems out there which take
heavy inspiration from the AD&D 2nd edition vision of dragons. And while AD&D
did actually include dragons appropriate for almost every point in a PC's
career, the same might not be true of these other systems.

Take Shadowrun, for example. This is a game that started by following the AD&D
2nd Edition party line ("Dragons are a Big Deal and You're Not Ready For Them"),
and never did anything to control its Dragon Inflation. Now your average
Shadowrun dragon is tougher than a tank and faster than a fighter jet, and also
an Illuminaty-level genius conspirator who is instantly able to grok modern
society despite having been asleep for the last ten thousand years. And that's
before we even get to the "special" named dragons that combine all of the above
with the worst in 90's-style NPC exceptionalism. Literally half of the latest
writeup of Denver I read is composed of variations on the idea that if you do
anything to displease the Great Dragon Ghostwalker, he will _know_, and he will
_end_ you.

Dungeon Fantasy doesn't go nearly that far. It's surprisingly close to OD&D in
its approach. The weakest statted dragon is a tough but manageable "boss"
challenge for a well-prepared party of moderately powerful adventurers, which in
this case refers to the starting power level of 250 points. It does not,
however, do much to dispel the decades of accumulated Dragon Performance Anxiety
people might feel from their previous experience with other systems.

## What's the point of all this again?

What did I write this for? Well, it turns out I'm suffering from a little Dragon
Performance Anxiety myself, and I need to get it out of my system. About the
only monsters left to write up in my [Dragon's Dogma bestiary][2] are the
dragon-class monsters like the Hydra and the actual dragons. I stalled for the
longest time on these. Could I make them enough of a Big Deal, or would I mess
up their stat blocks? It wasn't until the DFRPG box set came out that I felt I
had enough of a yardstick to measure them against. And now I think I'm ready to
start writing them up, finally.

The solution to this anxiety, of course is to just let it go. Accept that it's
okay to have dragons that your party can fight before they reach the "demigodly
superhero" level of power, and that a dragon fight doesn't have to be this
absolutely perfect set piece that happens at the absolutely best dramatic moment
possible. It's time I start taking that advice!
