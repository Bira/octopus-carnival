A lot of people tend to wax poetical about "Old School" roleplaying these
days. The main idea is that, after a couple of decades of poo-pooing D&D and the
dominant styles of play from the 70s and 80s, these people have come around to
the notion that old D&D is fun after all. Of course, people have been playing
and writing material for their preferred editions forever, but the scene seems
to have changed in the past few years.

After Pathfinder successfully exploited one of the many D&D edition wars and
proved to the world at large that it was OK to sell a game that was pretty much

money poured into similar efforts turned this general preference for older
editions of this specific game into a _movement_, with a _brand_: the Old School

a trip to the Galapagos and meeting the fascinating life forms therein for the
first time.

You see, Smolensk started playing AD&D 1st Edition back in the late
Seventies. He got himself the three core books, started a campaign with a group
of his friends. Developed an impressive amount of house rules for everything,
and a setting of his own based on Earth's 17th century with added D&D
elements. All of this without coming into contact with the "larger roleplaying
community" even once.

Now, most roleplayers I know, myself included, came into contact with that
community very early in their own "careers", through the Internet. We were
perhaps teens, or a little older. We got to see how other groups did things, and
I'm sure most of us got absolutely horrified that other peop
