## The Lore

Abalach-Re is a Sorcerer-Queen who rules the city of Raam as its Grand Vizier, a
title she chose because she claims to rule on behalf of a (fictional) deity
named Badna. Outwardly, she seems like a lazy, decadent and debauched ruler, who
lets her nobles make war on each other while her police forces oppress a
starving population and numerous rebellions grow right under her nose.

In reality, she's a lot more aware of what goes on in her domain. It's just that
the enjoys the cruelty on display, and likes to see those nascent rebellions
crushed. She _is_ decadent and debauched, but even that is a fruit of her
explorations on the limits of her own physical form. This research has granted
her prodigious body manipulation abilities, which she teaches to her closest
agents and favored children.

Abalach-Re keeps a close eye on her peers and was the one who alerted them when
Dregoth got a bit too uppity. She makes sure to keep her own self-modification
experiments a secret from the other sorcerer-kings, as these are her chosen path
to ascension as a god-like being.

Raam's day-to-day administration is in the hands of several noble houses, each
of which controls a different district. They're more like organized crime
syndicates than anything else, constantly at each other's throats and united
only in their desire to exploit the people under their charge. They're aided in
this by the city's police force. Its officers, the Mansabdars, theoretically
answer directly to the Queen, but in practice are all in the pockets of whatever
noble house oversees their beat, and are no more than brutal thugs.

Abalach-Re lets them all do it because, as stated above, she likes the
cruelty. Instead of reining it in, she created an elite secret police force, the
High Kuotaghas, who actually enforce her will in the city and act to smack down
any noble who gets a little _too_ confident. Kuotaghas often receive their
queen's "gifts" and as such have access to some body horror powers.

Most of the Queen's children are part of her court or members of the Kuotaghas,
but some have turned against her. She lets them, because all of ther children
have unknowingly been implanted with magical locator beacons. Even the
rebellious ones are useful tools to detect other rebels.

## The Numbers

We get three entries here and as usual I'm going to talk about them in order of
ascending level.

### Street Mansabdar

A typical member of the force that should be enforcing the city's laws but is
instead enforcing the will of some local warlord in exchange for fat
bribes. It's a Level 7 Soldier with 76 HP and a speed of 6. Clad in hide armor,
it's armed with a mace and a scourge.

The **Mace** is our basic attack, which damages and marks on a hit. If a marked
target ignores the mark, the mansabdar can use its **scourge** against them as
an interrupt. It does the same damage as the mace, and knocks prone on a hit.

Then the mansabdar can use **Beat Down** against the prone target, which deals
the same damage as a basic mace strike and slows for a turn. If the target
stands up before the end of its next turn, it also takes ongoing 5 damage (save
ends).

### High Kuotagha

A trusted agent of Abalach-Re, member of the group actually responsible for
enforcing her will in the city. While still tagged as a human in its stat block,
this kuotagha was _extensively_ mutated by his boss, which I'm sure will be a
nice surprise to the PCs. It's a level 21 Lurker with 150 HP, a ground speed of
7, and a Spider Climb speed of 6. It also has low-light vision.

The kuotagha fights with **Claws**, which target Reflex instead of AC, meaning
they're the "shreds armor like paper" kind. It can also extrude a **Flesh
Garrote** that does the same damage and grabs on a hit. This grab inflicts a -4
penalty to escape attempts, and there is no limit to the number of victims the
kuotagha can grab in this way. I'll let you imagine how that works. All grabs
can be sustained at once with a single standard action, which also does some
automatic damage to the victim.

All other traits here depend on the kuotagha having one or more grabbed
victims. The ~~creature~~ agent of the law can inflict criticals on its grabbed
victims on a 18-20 (which is _incredibly_ generous in 4e), has a +4 to all
defenses while it has a grabbed victim, and when someone attacks it while it's
grabbing someone it can shift 1 square and slide any grabbed victims 1 square to
a square adjacent to it as in interrupt. This will only happen once per round,
but it's gonna be _so annyoing_.

And this is a regular monster, meaning you could potentiall fight a whole team
of them at once.

### Abalach-Re, Sorcerer-Queen

Abalach-Re is a Level 23 Solo Controller with the Leader tag and 856 HP. Like
her henchthing above, she's technically human, but "technically" is doing even
more heavy lifting in her case. As mentioned above, she's seeking a custom path
to immorality that involves lot of self-bioengineering, and the fruits of this
are evident in this stat block.

Abalach-Re has low-light vision, a ground speed of 8, and a flight speed of 5
with hover and an altitude limit of 2. The **Spirit Flight** trait gives her
insubstantial and phasing while she moves.

Two of her three basic attacks can be either melee 1 or ranged 10: **Telekinetic
Thrust** targets Fortitude, deals physical damage, slides 5 squares and
immobilizes (save ends); **Instinct Overload** targets Will, deals psychic
damage and lets Abalach-Re dictate the next move or standard action the target
will take on their turn, though she cannot force a victim to use a power.

The third basic attack is **Disrupting Touch**, which targets Reflex and can be
either Melee 3 or Ranged 10. On a hit it deals physical damage and ongoing 10
force damage (save ends). Unlike the others, which are obviously psychic powers,
I think this one might be a touch spell where she stretches her arms really far.

Anyway, **Morphing Power Splice** lets Abalach-Re make three attacks with one
action without provoking opportunity attacks, so she could use any combination
of the above on the same turn.

She can also lay down a **Defiling Field**, creating a zone in a Close Burst 3
that lasts until the end of the encounter. Any enemy that takes damage within
the zone also takes ongoing 15 necrotic damage (save ends). Thankfully this is
an encounter power, but it recharges when she's first bloodied.

Her movement power is **Allocation**, which lets her teleport 10 squares and
then slide any enemy adjacent to her at the arrival point 5 squares. This also
recharges when she's first bloodied.

In addition to all of the above, when Abalach-Re is hit with any attack she can
use **Vengeance of Adaptive Flesh** as a reaction. This is a Ranged 10 attack
that targets Will, and deals ongoing damage of the same type she just took (save
ends). Like all of her other ranged attacks, this doesn't provoke opportunity
attacks.

It looks to me like she wants to stay mostly away from the PCs, using her powers
to slide them into the defiling field so she can further damage them with more
attacks and ongoing damage.

## Encounters and Final Impressions

This is a pretty strong opening for this section, and a brief look tells me
Abalach-Re is likely the weakest of the Sorcerer Kings. She doesn't seem to have
any particular resistance against being stunlocked by PC powers, so even though
she's a solo you might want to add some high kuotagha bodyguards to her fight.
