# Intro

In our last scene, our heroes officially decided to reform the Silver Ravens,
and decided their first mission is to check out the abandoned Raven hideout
under the Fair Fortune Livery. In this scene, we'll see how that goes.

No interrupt checks today, because I don't wanna.

## Mythic Bookkeeping

The Chaos Factor for the last scene was 5, and I want to keep it at 5 even
though the last scene was peaceful.

Let's add the Three-Legged Devil tavern as a character. I don't think it ever
comes up again in the default campaign, but it might here! If it comes up on a
roll, it could either about the location itself or about the people associated
with it.

We can also close the "Reunite!" thread, as that happened last scene.

So here are our lists.


**Threads**

- The Path
- Find the Missing Elves (Arcturus)
- Find Shensen (Rosalia)
- Contacting Ms. Docur (Jania)
- Get Organized (Jade)

**Characters**

- The Dottari
- The Chelish Citizens Group
- The Red Jills
- The Asmodeans
- The Three-Legged Devil

Delving the Livery counts as following The Path.
