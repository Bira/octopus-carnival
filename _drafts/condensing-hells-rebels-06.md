This final adventure has two main goals. Negotiate a favorable peace treaty with
Cheliax, and kill Barzilai once and for all.

## Treaty Negotiation

Keep this scene as-is. It's mostly roleplaying and it's very atmospheric. For
once any extra paranoia the PCs display when securing the inn where talks take
place will pay off in spades.

## Kintargo Haunts

Keep a single haunt here, the one you like best. Feel free to make it stronger
if you want, since there's only one. Once that one is solved the characters get
the full vision pinpointing the Soul Anchor's location.

Forget Soul Points.

## The Soul Anchor

You can get away with keeping only the final encounter with the (possibly
allied) witchfire and the nemesis devil. Add the dragon if that particular fight
would be fun for your group, but any other combat encounters here can be safely
eliminated.

Do give the PCs mythic powers when they claim the heart, if you have access to
those rules.

## Hell

I am not inclined to go on an detailed exploration of this asshole dictator's
life. He does not need to be understood, he needs to be stopped.

So, again, forget the Soul Points mechanic. Remove the fights from Floors 1, 2,
3, 5 and 8. This leaves only the ones directly related to rescuing the nereid
and azata prisoners. If both are rescued the party will face Barzilai in his
weaker state. Otherwise he uses the enhanced stat block.
