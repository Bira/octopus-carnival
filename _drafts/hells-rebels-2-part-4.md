## Concluding the Adventure

Clearing the Lucky Bones hideout completely and reactivating the magical pump
makes the place usable as the official home base of the Silver Ravens,
increasing the maximum power of the rebellion. Over the course of this adventure
the PCs have also likely gained the support of the Torrent Knights, earned a
number of favors from a powerful Navy captain, and caught a notorious serial
killer.

All of those things (particularly catching the serial killer) force Barzilai
Thrune to publicly acknowledge the existence of the Silver Ravens. He will do so
in a public ceremony in the Kintargo Opera House, where he will honor the PCs
for keeping the streets of the city safe and present them with gifts decorated
with a silver raven motif.

While The Barzilai has it out of the PCs, he will not try to hurt them here, and
will do his best to appear civil. The gifts are even magic items tailored to be
useful to the PCs! The trick here is that the items are distinctive enough to be
tracked via _locate object_ (D&D) and Seeker (GURPS), which will likely come to
bite the PCs unless they're very crafty. And speaking of crafty, PCs who _don't_
try to pick a fight during the ceremony gain a XP reward for being
discreet. Stabbing Thrune in front of a crow of thousands might be satisfying,
but is unlikely to be productive at this point in time.

The book says that Barzilai has completed one of the rituals necessary for
becoming a genius loci not long before the public ceremony, and so is looking a
bit haggard and pale. He'll be back in top form in time for the fight against
the PCs, of course.
