[Death Knights][3] have a long and storied existence in D&D, but this is the
first time I hear of Hell Knights.

## The Lore

Hell Knights are absolutely not Nazgul, no way, no how. They're _narzugons_,
which is a completely different thing. Jokes aside, their origins are quite
tragic.

The first hell knights used to be servants of He Who Was, the god Asmodeus
rebelled against. Asmodeus tricked them into betraying their former master, and
their betrayal damned them to serve Asmodeus forever. From that point forward,
whenever someone got tricked into betraying their deity, they would become new
hell knights upon death.

I think this is the first time I see an explicit mention of people going to Hell
and becoming devils in 4e. This used to be a 3e thing, so I guess Hell Knights
come from that edition. It could also be that angels and other immortals become
hell knights when they get tricked into betraying their deities, if you want to
play it that way.

Though hell knights are powerful, becoming one is definitely a form of
punishment. A Hell Knight's existence is an eternity of hatred. They hate
themselves for their betrayal, they hate their new masters, they hate their
immortality, and they hate free mortals. Though many of them serve Asmodeus
directly, every potentate of Hell has at least a few knights at their
disposal. The most famous group of them is the Order of the Nightmare, so named
for their preferred mounts. Other groups have other mounts, like the
mammoth-riding knights of Cania, or the ash riders of Avernus with their
wyverns.

Hell Knights usually only associate with members of their own order, but will
work together with other devils when commanded to do so.

## The Numbers

Hell Knights are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils), and Level 15 Soldiers with
146 HP. They have Darkvision, are immune to fear, and have Resist 20 Fire. Their
ground speed is 6, but they will almost always be mounted on something
faster. Their gear is the full "Classic Knight" setup of plate armor, heavy
shield, a lance, and a mace.

Their **Hell's Rider** trait allows their mount to use the knight's Athletics,
Acrobatics and Stealth scores if they would be better than the mount's own. The
**mace** does bonus fire damage and knocks prone on a hit, and the **lance** has
better base tamage and crits on a 19-20 when used on a charge. Both count as
basic attacks.

As a minor action they can use **Eyes of the Narzugon**, which causes a creature
within 10 squares to be marked and slowed for a turn. This is an effect, so it
auto-hits.

## Final Impressions

Hell Knights pair really well with Nightmares! As I mentioned in the
[Nightmare][2] article, enemy riders can still take actions independently of
their mounts, so the knights can charge with their lances and maces at the same
time their nightmare mounts set the map on fire. Since they have native fire
resistance, they can ignore the burning terrain even when unhorsed.

A simple but effective hell knight encounter would consist of three knights and
three nightmares, using classic medieval cavalry tactics (charge early, charge
often). This group's lack of ranged attacks would be compensated by the
nightmare's high teleport speed.
