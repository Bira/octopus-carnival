title: "Dragon's Dogma: Equipment Upgrades"
category: gurps

While the [previous post][1] gives you a pretty complete picture of the gear
available to Gransys adventurer's, there's one aspect left to cover that can
really bring that Dragon's Dogma feel: equipment upgrades.

The original game not only has a very extensive selection of equipment, it also
allows the player to _upgrade_ each of those items. Certain weapon vendors can
apply from one to three upgrade levels to a weapon or a piece of armor. Each one
increases its damage or protection value and decreases its weight. This both
costs money and requires "special components". More often than not, that means
_monster parts_, though some might require specific types of ore or
miscellaneous items like buckets and sconces instead. It's unclear whether these
upgrades are a mundane or magical process.

In addition to this, when the player kills a dragon there's a chance that their
equipment may be "Dragonforged", which improves it beyond what's possible with
the normal upgrades. It also has a nice mythic resonance!

Something like might have a place in the tabletop version, so let's try
to figure out a way to replicate its feel without needing to come up with a
detailed list of monster parts required for each of the hundreds of entries in
GURPS' gear books.

## Designing the Upgrade System for GURPS

We've seen what the system in the original game looked like.
