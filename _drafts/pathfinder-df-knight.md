Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder's Iconic Characters to
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**! This is the sixth post in the series. Previous
entries can be found here:

Today's template is the Knight, which means that today's character is
Valeros. Here he is:

His character design is somewhat bland, and while his [bio][6] is one of the
longest I've seen, it's also one of the least spectacular so far. At least it's
better written than Lini's, which was kind of confusing to parse. His official
stats are [here][7]. From these we can learn the following:

- Valeros is from the nation of Andoran, his world's "18th century US"
  equivalent. He's the typical farmboy who ran away from home and towards
  adventure.

- He wears medium armor and fights with paired swords. He likes making lots of
  attacks on vulnerable enemy locations. He has a bow as a backup for ranged
  combat.

And... that's pretty much it. Anything else I could say here would just be
reiterating his biography, which I try to avoid doing too much in these
writeups. The most unique thing about Valeros is that he likes to fight with two
swords. The standard Knight template is more than enough to cover that, and
unlike the d20 Fighter it actually lives up to its reputation as the most
effective overall combatant in the game!

As you can see below, our version of Valeros wields two full-sized broadswords
instead of a longsword/shortsword pair, because there's no restriction
preventing him from doing so in GURPS. He spent 2 of his character points in
starting cash.
