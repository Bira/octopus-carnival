Welcome back to our series of conversions of Pathfinder's Iconic Characters to
**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy**! This is the sixth post in the series. Previous
entries can be found here:

- [Seelah the Paladin][5]

Today's template is the Knight, which means that today's character is
Valeros. Here he is:

As the iconic Fighter, he's a member of one of the weakest and least interesting
d20 classes (why the Fighter class is like this is a tired old rant that has no
place here). His character design is somewhat bland, but his [bio][6] is one of
the longest I've seen. Despite that, it's also one of the least spectacular so
far. At least it's better written than Lini's, which was kind of confusing to
parse. His official stats are [here][7]. From these we can learn the following:

- Valeros started life as a peasant in the nation of Andoran, and ran away from
  home to escape an arranged marriage. He spent a while as a mercenary, but
  always had far too much of a conscience to last long in the employ of a
  mercenary company.

- He enjoys the pleasures of "hard drink and soft company" (in his own
  words). This leads to a somewhat crass demeanor, which he uses to mask his
  more noble impulses. He has a reputation for thoughtlessness but is smarter
  and more educated than he lets on.

- Valeros fights with two swords, and tries to place himself in a position to
  rain as many blows as possible upon the enemy. While he wields a shortsword
  and a longsword, all of his weapon-specific feats apply to the longsword.

As it happens, our poor Fighter is in luck! The DF template that corresponds to
this class is the mighty Knight! Unlike d20 Fighters, Knights really do live up
to the hype of being the overall best melee combatants in DF.
