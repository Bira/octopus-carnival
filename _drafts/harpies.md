This is the third post of a series converting Dragon's Dogma enemies to
**GURPS**. Previous posts can be found below:

From a distance, harpies look like man-sized owls, with round heads and thick
plumage. Only when they take flight and turn on you is it possible to notice
their human-like faces and upper torsos. These features are invariably those of
women: though there are male harpies, it's impossible to tell the difference
without dissection.

Harpies also have feminine voices, though they seem to be incapable of verbal
communication. In fact, they behave like large birds of prey, nesting at high
altitudes and ranging far and wide in search of prey. Harpies are full
carnivores and will attack anything that seems meaty enough to sustain them -
even people. They are an ever-present hazard in Gransys' highlands and mountain
passes.

Note that these harpies are different from the those presented in **GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 3: Born of Myth and Magic**. You are free to use those
here as well!

No one has managed to tame a harpy, but those crazy enough to try are willing to
pay handsomely for unhatched eggs. Fetching those would require climbing the
steep crags where they make their nests, a challenging proposition even if one
doesn't have to contend with a choir of enraged harpies on the way up.

These creatures originally came from beyond the world: ancient accounts of past
draconic invasions report armies of them arriving through the same rift as the
Dragon itself. Several stable populations remain:

## Brown Harpies

These inhabit the mountain chain separating South and Central Gransys, as well
as the mountains to the soutwest beyond the Shadow Fort. Their skin is an ashen
grey, covered in dark brown feathers.

Brown harpies have innate magical abilities: their song can compel other
creatures to sleep, an effect that becomes stronger the more voices are added to
the choir. Brown harpies live in bands ("choirs") of 4-6 adults.

Brown harpies fight by using their soporific song and then grappling their
sleeping victims and dropping them from a great height. If they can't do that
(because the target is too heavy, or resists the song), then they'll attempt to
rake with their talons. As detailed in **Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 3**, harpy
flyby attacks receive the -4 for Move and Attack but don't have their skill
capped at 9, and they may retreat _up_ while dodging to receive a +4 bonus.

**ST** 15; **DX** 13; **IQ** 6; **HT** 13

**SM** +1; **Dodge** 9; **DR** 2;

**HP** 15; **Will** 10; **Per** 12; **FP** 13

**Basic Speed** 6.50; **Move** 3 (Ground)/13 (Air)

- **Soporific Song (15 vs Will)**: Resisted by Will, at -1 per singing harpy
  beyond the first. Affects non-harpies within 10m who hear the song. First
  failure causes sluggishness (1/2 Move and Dodge) while the song lasts. Second
  failure causes the target to fall asleep for 1 hour or until awoken, possibly
  by being dropped from a great height by the harpy.
- **Talons (16)**: 1d+3 cut. Reach C. May also _grapple_ at skill 14.
- **Bite (16)**: 1d+2 cut.

**Traits**: Acute Vision 2; Claws (Talons); DR 3 (Tough Skin); Flight (Winged);
Peripheral Vision; Striking ST 4; Teeth (Sharp); Bestial; Fragile; Social Stigma
(Monster).

**Skills**: Aerobatics-14; Brawling-16; Wrestling-14

**Class**: Faerie.

## Snow Harpies

These inhabit the northern highlands of Gransys, particularly the area known as
Souflayer Canyon. Their skin is black, and their feathers are snow-white with
black spots. Snow harpies possess the same soporific song as their southern
cousins, and are also endowed with a deadly frost breath attack. Use the same
stats for a brown harpy, but add the following attack:

- **Frost Breath (14)**: 1d(5) burning (Jet; 5/10). This is extreme cold, not
  fire, and thus is not incendiary.
