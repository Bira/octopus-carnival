Chapter 2 of Adventurers is all about Professions, and contains the templates
nearly all players will use to build their characters. Your profession is
roughly equivalent to a D&D character's class. It determines the things you are
good at and "how" you're good at them. The ones in this book are:

- **Barbarians** are strong and tough warriors who are adept at wilderness
  survival.

- **Bards** are socially adept characters who can influence minds through words,
  song, and magic.

- **Clerics** channel the divine to heal, bless, and exorcise.

- **Druids** control plants, animals, and the weather. They're also excellent at
  outdoors survival.

- **Holy Warriors** hunt down and slay Evil monsters using divine powers.

- **Knights** are heavily armored warriors trained in personal and group
  tactics.

- **Martial Artists** have mystically-powered athlethic and combat abilities.

- **Scouts** are stealthy survivalists and master archers.

- **Swashbucklers** are roguish skirmishers who rely on speed and skill to
  defend themselves.

- **Thieves** open locks, disarm traps, and excel at both stealth and dungeon
  parkour.

- **Wizards** are masters of weird lore and have the highest variety of spells
  at their disposal.
