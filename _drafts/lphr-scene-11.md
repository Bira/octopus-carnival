# [GM] Intro

As mentioned last scene, I'm doing this week's tactical mission on a separate
file from the strategic turn, since that one ran long. Today, we'll be running
through "Crackdown at Clenchjaw's", which should be a nice and breezy affair.

We'll keep the Chaos Factor at 6 and all the Mythic stuff just as it was:

**Threads**

- The Path ****
- Find Shensen (Rosalia, Arcturus) *
- Contacting Ms. Docur (Jania)
- Get Organized (Jade) **

**Characters**

- The Dottari
- The Chelish Citizens Group
- The Red Jills
- The Asmodeans
- The Three-Legged Devil (location)
- The Livery Grimples
- The Tengu Sisters
- Nan Comerivos & Friends

# [PC] Crackdown at Clenchjaw's

In the middle of the PCs' various investigations, Laria comes to them with
rumors that Clenchjaw's tavern is becoming suspiciously rowdy, and that it might
soon attract unwanted attention.

Rosalia knows about the place, a tavern near the docks. The establishment is
named after a local species of oyster. Its owner caught the same nickname
because he strictly forbids talk of politics inside the building, and kicks out
anyone who breaks the rule. Nevertheless the place is usually frequented by
people who might sympathize with the Ravens, especially since some of the more
overtly anti-Thrune bars around town were burned down.

The thing with the rowdy patrons is new, however. Clenchjaw has been getting
sleepy as the evening goes on, and when he dozes off the brawls begin. You can
almost set your clock by them. Something's off. This might seem like a small
thing, but it would be in their interests to keep this place running and to
prevent it from drawing dottari.

So one fine afternoon, our heroes decide to go bar-crawling. Our scene will
consist of them investigating the weirdness at Clenchjaw's.

## [GM] Scene setup

Let's check for altered or interrupted scenes, because our "player" has a
walkthrough in hand and it'd be too easy to solve this case with the PCs'
skills.

A roll of 1 means we get an altered scene.

Let's say that things have progressed further than anticipated. The titular
crackdown is going to happen _tonight_. The dottari have already caught wind of
Clenchjaw's being a place where "dissidents" hang out and have fights, which
gives them a perfect excuse to hand out beatings.

So there's 6 dottari hanging out near the bar and as soon as anything resembling
a fight starts, they'll burst inside and try to bust some heads.

The trip itself is uneventful, as the excitement is at the end.

## [Player] At Clenchjaw's

The group arrives there at around 5 PM, and what they spot is a relatively
normal tavern. Other people are starting to stream in and soon things begin
getting more lively.

Rosalia actually... kinda loves this? It's been a while since she's had the
opportunity to party a little. She has Compulsive Carousing and I'm making her
fail this on purpose. This is a -5 point disadvantage, so she will be a bit
tipsy and have -1 to all rolls this scene. Urist will soon end up joining her,
and will suffer from the same penalty.

The rest of the PCs will pace themselves a little better.

They spend their first hour at the tavern, looking around, talking to patrons,
eating, and drinking.

    [GM] There's a 30% chance for a brawl to break out in the first hour as
    Vendalfek begins messing with people using his magic. Every PC gets to
    contest their Perception against the dragon's Stealth 14.

    Ironically, it's the two tipsy PCs who manage to spot the dragon.

(2026-01-26)

By the end of the hour Rosalia is leading a few people in a tavern song,
her awesome bard voice accompanied by a lot of tuneless revelry, including from
Urist.

"... and the cow jumped over the -- wait, is that a dragon?"

The dragon in question is about the size of a cat, with green scales and
colorful butterfly wings, and is sneaking around the tavern's rafters. It
squeaks in panic and immediately begins to fade away as the other PCs and quite
a few patrons look at it.

Jania knows the creature is turning invisible and begins casting her See
Invisible spell... but rolls a 17, which is a critical failure! She rolls a 5 on
the critical failure table, meaning that spell affects the wrong target. Since
this was a beneficial step, it affects a nearby foe, and the closest thing to
that here is Vendalfek himself.

Since Invisibility takes 3 seconds to cast, he has time to giggle at the goof
before vanishing as he begins running away.

Unfortunately several of the tavern's patrons also saw him, and the relatively
small commotion caused by that is enough to draw the dottari in. They arrive
with their maces and shields out, their commanding officer shouting to ask
what's going on here. Time to defuse the situation.

Jania and Rosalia step forward to handle them, acting all friendly and trying to
reassure them no braws are happening here, mister officer, no sir. Meanwhile,
the other PCs hang back a bit and prepare to "defuse" the guards should worse
come to worst.

    Time for Influence skills! These are garden-variety dottari guards with Will
    score of 10. Let's give their commanding officer Will 11, as he's the one
    they're interacting with.

Rosalia takes the lead in talking, with Jania supplying the occasional "helpful"
statement to further muddy the issue. With the drunkenness penalty, her reaction
bonuses and the +1 from Jania's successful aid attempt, we're looking at an
effective skill of 19, which is awesome because the rule of 16 is only for
_supernatural_ effects.

... and then she goes and rolls a 18, which is always a critical failure.

So what happens is that the sargeant becomes convinced he's in front of someone
he can pass off as a genuine rebel. He grabs Rosalia by the arm and drags her
outside the tavern. Jania follows, making now useless attempts to calm the
situation. The rest of the PCs see this unfold and soon follow. No one else
does.

## [GM] I Just Had The Most Wonderful Idea

These dice sure gave me some surprises. I expected this to be a mostly mapless
social and investigative challenge, and here we are gearing up for a right
against six dottari.

I actually made a map for this, but though there are some interesting terrain
quirks in there this is mostly just another boring street map, of the area just
outside the tavern. It was boring to make, and I feel that as a player it'd be
mostly boring to play through.

So let's spice things up a little, because I have a downloaded map here that
slots right into Foundry. It's the one for the Unsanctioned Excruciation
scenario.

You see, the dottari here aren't very interested in due process. They want to be
entertained, and the only thing that entertains them is cruelty. Now they could
just beat Rosalia and Jania to death in an alley, but one of them decides to get
clever.

Barzilai has been paying bounties for large dogs, delivered alive to the
dottari, because he's going to use those for official excruciations in the near
future. If they're gonna do that anyway, why not start early? Mr. Smart Guard
knows just the place.

Our group is savvy enough to realize they're taking the pair of them _away_ from
the tavern without harming them just yet, which ends up being good because they
don't want to draw heat to the place by murdering six guards on its doorstep. So
even though Art has some trouble holding back his righteous anger, the rest of
the group decides to follow the guards at a safe distance.

And as GM I'm saying they manage it because I don't want to have a fight in a
boring street.

The guards take Rosalia and Jania to a small square a ways away from the tavern,
where an doghousing setup has just been built but not yet inaugurated. The dogs
are already inside, and the process of starving them to make them mad is well
underway. They chuck Rosalia and Jania in there after relieving them of their
weapons, and stand around to watch for the rest of their shift.

## [Player] Unsanctioned Excruciation

We start off in the Unsanctioned Excruciation map for the book. There's a small
park with a lily pont and a pagoda-gazebo in the middle. Dottari and CCG
assholes have, in the previous days, turned the gazebo into an impromptu kennel,
with two hungry mastiffs chained inside. Now they've thrown Jania and Rosalia
inside after removing their weapons.

As explained in the book, "doghousing" is a public torture method devised by
Barzilai. The victims stay confined in the "doghouse" at the center during days
and nights, and they must spend this whole time sitting uncomfortably because
there's nails inside that will stab into them if they try to stand or lie
down. At dusk and dawn, they're let out to eat... if they can manage to steal
the food from the two angry chained dogs.

Rosalia and Jania are still out of the doghouse, as they wanted to see them
react to the dogs. The guards are hanging around to enjoy the view for a moment
and plan to lock them in later. Three of them are on each side of the square.

Our group arrives at this point. They split up with Urist and Art on one side,
and Jade by herself on the other. The guards have not noticed them yet, and this
gives Urist time to charge up a three dice Sunbolt to blast one of them with as
an opener.


### Turn 1

After the opener I rule the guards are surprised, because fuck 'em. They're
mentally stunned and will need to succeed at an IQ roll before they can do
anything, as usual.

Jade does this "by the book", stepping forward and verbally challenging a
guard. Art runs in stabbing, though his knife ends up deflected.

After some moments of fright anteceding the fight, Jania and Rosalia realize
_they_ are not chained, and edge away from the dogs and towards the gate closest
to Rosalia.

The dogs pursue them to the limit of their 2-meter chains, which are not long
enough to reach the doghouse, let alone the prisoners' new positions. A single
guard passes their save this turn, meaning he can act in the next one.

### Turn 2

Urist draws his axe and approaches the fight, though he's stil a ways a way
(this park is annoyingly large). The non-stunned dottarius tries to bonk Art
with his mace, only to drop it due to a critical failure. Arcturus grapples him
in return.

The guard who got hit with the sunbolt earlier passes his save, but will only be
able to act next turn.

Jania decides to push her magical lock-opening trick to its limit, by taking a
-10 skill penalty to open the nearest lock instantly. That's a 50/50 chance for
her, and she does it. Rosalia arrives next to her now.

### Turn 3

Arcturus stabs the guard he grappled earlier, spending his Control Points to
increase damage, and puts him out of commission. The other wounded guard tries
to retaliate, but misses.

Urist gets into position to defend Art's right flank, and the remaining guard on
their side engages him.

The guards on the right side begin recovering. Jade approaches one who is still
surprised and slashes him good with her backsword, but the weapon turns on her
hand on the counterstroke.

Jania opens the door and Rosalia runs through, barely remaining outside the
dog's reach.

### Turn 4

Jade re-readies her sword and braces for the incoming attacks from her three
opponents, but the first of those is thankfully very innacurate.

Urist and his "dance partner" exchange attacks, both hitting shields.

Art grapples the wounded dottari, who fails to escape.

Jania and Rosalia run out of the cage and into the right-side bridge. Rosalia
insults one of the dottari engaging Jania, stunning him again!
