I read some things recently that got me thinking about a common issue I remember
seeing at various points throughout my gaming "career". "Single System Syndrome"
pops into my mind as a name for it, though of course it's not a disease or
disorder of any sort. Rather, I guess it's a source of cognitivie bias.

It's what happens when a player comes into the roleplaying hobby through a
specific system and never really considers trying anything else for whatever
reason. Over time the player's needs change and evolve, but since they always
stay within the same system they might either end up completely changing it
through house rules, or becoming chronically unhappy with their gaming. What
these players never quite get around to doing is adopting a different
system. I've most often seen this behavior tied to some iteration of D&D, but it
was also really frequent in Shadowrun.

[Lich van Winkle][1]'s experience is that D&D only became the inescapable
pachiderm in the room of gaming very recently, and that it was never so before
his long hiatus, but my own experience is a bit different. I live in Brazil, and
most of the Brazilian roleplaying community was at the mercy of a handful of
companies who licensed foreign games and published translated versions. If you
were playing any sort of fantasy game in those days, you were very likely to be
playing AD&D 2nd edition. The other option was that Basic D&D variant that came
in a board game box and got you to level 5, which everyone sooner or later
ditched for AD&D because it was "advanced" and got you to level 20.

So AD&D was most of what anyone in the incipient Brazilian online fan community
ever talked about, and when 3rd edition and the d20 licence came out it came to
completely dominate all conversations. That's about when people stopped
specifying what system they were talking about when they asked questions
online, because everyone assumed it was going to be D&D.

I was also into Shadowrun during these years, mostly because of the SNES
game. The 2nd Edition corebook got a very shoddy translation in '94, and I was
privileged enough to be able to buy and read the English supplements for the
game. I got a big bunch of them when I went into this UK student exchange thingy
for a month in '96. And I got into mailing lists and such for the
English-speaking online fan community.

I loved Shadowrun because it broke many of AD&D's default assumptions. No
classes, no levels, no equipment restrictions[^1]! I soon found out that this
joy at "breaking free" from D&D was one of the online community's foundational
pillars. Other players and GMs on those mailing lists just loved to talk about
