This is the third post of a series converting Dragon's Dogma enemies to
**GURPS**. Previous posts can be found below:

Saurians are the least populous of the three sapient species inhabiting the
Gransys peninsula. They are less technically sophisticated than humans but
require little in the way of tools due to their great strength and
hardiness. And while they're not nearly as malicious as goblins, they're
fiercely territorial and have no qualms about eating any trespassers.

A Saurian's body is densely muscled and covered in scales similar to a
crocodile's in texture. Their heads resemble those of [bearded dragons][4], and
their mouths are filled with sharp teeth. A Saurian is able to walk upright not
just because of its roughly humanoid limbs, but because of its thick tail that
acts as a counterweight and shifts its center of mass backwards. The final
result makes even a burly human warrior look rather puny.

Saurians live in small bands humans call "basks" for their tendency to be found
basking in the sun. They reproduce by laying large eggs with soft, slimy
shells that require constaint moisture, which means basks often claim territory
near large bodies of water.

Saurians fight using crude spears and polearms sized for their large
frames. These and the occasional rawhide satchel are the most sophisticated
tools any human has seen them use. Those experienced in fighting them know to
sever the tail: it can be targeted from the side or behind at a -2
penalty. Injury over HP/2 cripples it, which means the Saurian is unable to
stand upright. This doesn't reduce its movement, but it _does_ mean it can only
use its natural weapons to fight.

Saurians in this state will usually try to flee the battle. The tail grows back
in time even if severed!

## Common Saurian

The most commonly found variety of Saurian is a dark brownish green in color,
and conforms exactly to the general description above. They are cold-blooded,
and thus tend to keep to Gransys' warmer southern reaches. The stats below are
for an _average_ Saurian. Stronger and more skilled specimens are certainly
possible!

In the original game, there was a sizable group of them living in a flooded
seaside cave underneath Cassardis, complete with a large amount of eggs.

**ST** 15; **DX** 12; **IQ** 8; **HT** 12

**SM** +1; **Dodge** 9; **Parry** 11U (dueling glaive); **DR** 4 (Tough Skin);

**HP** 15; **Will** 10; **Per** 10; **FP** 12

**Basic Speed** 6; **Move** 7.

- **Oversized Crude Dueling Glaive (16)**: thr+4 imp or sw+3 cut, Reach 1,2*.
- **Claw or Bite (14)**: 1d cut. The bite benefits from _Born Biter_ (**DF 3**,
  p. 15).
- **Tail Swipe (12)**: 1d+1 cr. No penalty to hit targets behind the saurian.

**Traits**: Born Biter; Claws (Sharp); DR 4 (Tough Skin); Peripheral Vision;
Striker (Tail, Clumsy: -2 to hit); Teeth (Sharp); Terrain Adaptation (Swamp);
Bestial; Cold-Blooded 2; Social Stigma (Monster).

**Skills**: Polearm-16, Brawling-14, Wrestling-14, Stealth-12

**Class**: Mundane.

**Equipment**: Crude, oversized dueling glaive.

## Sulfur Saurian

This species of Saurian is so named for the color of their scales, which are
black with bright yellow streaks. They are a little more tolerant of the cold
than Common Saurians, and thus live further north. They share the same general
traits described above, and possess two other remarkable abilities: they can
shift the color of their scales to match their surroundings, and they can spit
paralytic venom!

Use the stats for a common saurian, but reduce Cold-Blooded by 1 level, add
Chameleon 4 and the following attack:

- **Poison Spit (12)**: HT to resist; failure entails a non-cumulative -3 to DX
  and IQ for 1 hour. Acc 3, Range 10.

Needless to say, those bitten by a Sulfur Saurian are also subject to the
venom. They also frequently coat their weapons in it.
