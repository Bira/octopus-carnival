Arcturus Pankrator is a renowned hero and slayer of monsters among the
underwater peoples that make their home near Ravounel. Landlubbers have no idea
who he is, which is somewhat unfortunate for him because that's where he's
headed for the foreseeable future.

His newest quest is to search for a team of sea elf scouts from the village of
Acisazi that made their way to the surface city of Kintargo, and then vanished
without a trace. Their commander, Aava, was a relative of the village's leader,
who called to him for help. Arcturus (Art to his friends) was more than happy to
accept. It's what a hero does!

Unfortunately his wallet was considerably leaner than his muscles, so he's more
or less completely broke when he arrives at Kintargo. The information he manages
to gather about the city's situation isn't all that encouraging either, with
this new human dictator causing a pall of anger and sorrow to hang over the
city.

The Atlantean wrestler isn't exactly a genius detective. His method of
investigation can be summed by the word "vibes". Therefore, Arcturus is
absolutely sure that the shortest path to completing his quest lies in opposing
this land-monster, which is why he's at the big protest against him at the start
of the campaign.

## Build Notes

Arcturus is an obvious expy of Aquaman from Batman: The Brave and the Bold. He's
a mix of the Wrestler and Martial Artist archetypes. The Wrestler first appeared
in Pyramid #3/111. Art makes extensive use of the Fantastic Dungeon Grappling
rules, as does the campaign he's in.

He's an [Atlantean][1], which means he has no problem operating underwater. His
fighting style works well both in and out of water: grab'em, and stab'em. That
is, inflict a reasonable bunch of Control Points onto an enemy using Wrestling,
and then stab them with his knife while spending as many CP as possible to boost
the knife's damage dice. If there's no time to draw the knife, the damage dice
from CP alone should let Art twist almost any opponent like a pretzel anyway.

Character advancement is simple. More ST, more DR, higher combat skills, more
attacks! Those can come from either straight up increases or Martial Artist and
Wrestler powers (or better armor in the case of DR). He can also make excellent
use of Extra Attacks and Fast-Draw, which let the grab-and-stab loop happen much
faster. Any branching out will mostly be towards the addition of more acrobatic
and movement skills. Let everyone else do the talking and investigating,
Arcturus Pankrator is here to punch things and tie them in knots. Point him at
any nazis, sea monsters, or nazi sea monsters and watch the spectacle.
