Arcturus Pankrator is a renowned hero and slayer of monsters among the
underwater peoples that make their home near Ravounel. Landlubbers have no idea
who he is, which is somewhat unfortunate for him because that's where he's
headed for the foreseeable future.

His newest quest was given to him by the leader of the sea elf village of
Acisazi: he is to seek the help of Shensen, the famous singer and priestess of
Sarenrae who lives in Kintargo. The village has been plagued by a horrible
curse, and since Shensen is an old friend of theirs she would have both the
willingness and the power to help them out. However, she has not answered their
magical messages, so something might have happened to her. Time to send in an
actual envoy to find out what happened and help Shensen out if needed. An
excellent job for a hero of his caliber!

Unfortunately Arcturus' wallet was considerably leaner than his muscles, so he's
more or less completely broke when he arrives at Kintargo. The information he
manages to gather about the city's situation isn't all that encouraging either,
with Shensen missing and this new human dictator causing a pall of anger and
sorrow to hang over the city.

The Atlantean wrestler isn't exactly a genius detective. His method of
investigation can be summed by the word "vibes". Therefore, Arcturus is
absolutely sure that the shortest path to completing his quest lies in opposing
this land-monster, which is why he's at the big protest against him at the start
of the campaign.

## Description

Arcturus is an obvious expy of Aquaman from Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and
that's exactly what he looks like. You can make his hair brown instead of blond
if you won't want a 100% exact match, but you should still take all your
roleplaying cues from that version of Aquaman.

## Build Notes

Arcturus is a mix of the Wrestler and Martial Artist archetypes. The Wrestler
first appeared in Pyramid #3/111. Art makes extensive use of the Fantastic
Dungeon Grappling rules, as does the campaign he's in.

He's an [Atlantean][1], which means he has no problem operating underwater. His
fighting style works well both in and out of water: grab'em, and stab'em. That
is, inflict a reasonable bunch of Control Points onto an enemy using Wrestling,
and then stab them with his knife while spending as many CP as possible to boost
the knife's damage dice. If there's no time to draw the knife, the damage dice
from CP alone should let Art inflict some involuntary yoga on almost any
opponent anyway.

Character advancement is simple. More ST, more DR, higher combat skills, more
attacks! Those can come from either straight up increases or Martial Artist and
Wrestler powers (or better armor in the case of DR). He can also make excellent
use of Extra Attacks and Fast-Draw, which let the grab-and-stab loop happen much
faster. Any branching out will mostly be towards the addition of more acrobatic
and movement skills. Let everyone else do the talking and investigating,
Arcturus Pankrator is here to punch things and tie them in knots. Point him at
any nazis, sea monsters, or nazi sea monsters and watch the spectacle.
