Bobby is Sheila's younger brother, and the youngest member of the party. He's
also the most reckless by far, and frequently has to be prevented from charging
heedlessly into danger or saved after he does it anyway. Despite this he gets
along well with everybody and is especially fond of his sister Sheila and his
unicorn friend Uni.

Bobby is as eager to find a way home as the rest of the party, but deep down
he's very conflicted about it because going home also means leaving Uni
behind. He avoids thinking about this, but it can cause problems when the group
finds themselves in front of an actual portal. He's 8 years old when the show
starts.

Our version of Bobby is a 62-point character using the Apprentice _Fast_ Delver
template as a base. He's a Strong delver at heart, but he's also tiny. The
Barbarian package would make him an expert at wilderness survival but that's not
something the show usually bothers to cover. So instead of taking that template
we're picking two upgrade modules: Fifth Level Fighter and Veteran, which do a
good job of portraying Bobby's reckless bravery and his willingness to hit
things lots and lots of times.

Bobby is a perfect fit for the Fortune's Fool disadvantage module, and I made
custom picks for the other half.

Out of all the party, Bobby is the one most willing to engage in "traditional"
combat, but despite what his character sheet says he doesn't actually know how
to fight and the others often have to stop him from doing something
suicidal. His preferred tactic is to charge in and All-Out-Attack, and he's at
his most effective when he does that to the surrounding architecture.

## The Thunder Club

This top-heavy wooden club is indestructible and impervious to magic. It counts
as a light mace, but Bobby has to use it two-handed.

The club does sw+2+8d crushing damage. Rolled damage counts double for
knockback. The club's strikes automatically do maximum damage to unattended
inanimate objects (such as walls, support columns, or the ground).
