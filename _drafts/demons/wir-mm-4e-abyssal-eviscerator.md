Abyssal Eviscerators first show up in 4th Edition in the Monster Manual 2, but
since they're also in the Monster Vault we're getting to look at them a bit
early.

## The Lore

The name says it all, really. Abyssal Eviscerators come from the Abyss, and they
like to eviscerate. At Int 7, they don't know how to do much else, but then
again they don't want to. They frequently find themselves under the command of
stronger demons, or summoned by mortal demonologists of middling skill and
above.

## The Numbers

Abyssal Eviscerators are Medium Elemental Humanoids (demons), and Level 14
Brutes with 173 HP. The MM2 and MV versions are identical aside from the fixed
math. They have Speed 5, Variable Resistance 15 (2/encounter), and no special
senses.

Their basic attack is a claw, and they can also Grab at-will for slightly less
damage, an attack which obviously starts a grab if it hits. The MV version
specifies the demon can only grab at most two creatures at once, which is
sensible because it only has two large hands.

Abyssal Eviscerators can also bite grabbed targets as a minor action, doing 6
automatic damage to them. They can only do this once per round normally, but can
do it up to 3 times per round while bloodied.

## Final Impression

Nothing special here, really. These guys are basically paragon-tier evistros and
should be used in the same way.
