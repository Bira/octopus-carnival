# Intro

Our last scene was an investigation where the party managed to track down the
whereabouts of Nan Comerivos, the half-elf smuggler they need to rescue. They
found out he's being held prisoner at the Salix Salt Works, which was taken over
by mercenaries in service of Thrune and is being used to hold "low-threat"
prisoners.

This scene will then be about planning and executing the rescue mission.

It has been some months since I last played, and a lot of that was due to
Foundry being cantakerous last time. I was trying to find some ready made maps
for Hell's Rebels, because I didn't want to keep redrawing them in
Dungeondraft. I found a whole module with lots of bells and whistles covering
all of Adventure 01, but it had been done for a much older version of Foundry. I
remember spending like half a day trying to get the two to play together, but in
the end I gave up in frustration.

And now I sat town in front of it again, updated to the latest stable version,
and just imported the manually extracted map image from the old module into the
one I'm using to play. Total time to do the thing I had been dreading for
months: 5 minutes.

# GM Hat: Mythic Bookkeeping

While some unpredicted things happened last scene, the PCs also managed to
shorcut a long investigation, so I'm going to keep the chaos factor the same: 5.

We add "Prisoners of Salt" to our threads, as we should have done already last
scene. We advanced this thread then, and we expect to complete it in this
file. Let's add Nan Comerivos & Friends to the list of characters, as well as
Kossrani & Friends. These are the prisoners and their guards, respectively.

I roll a 2 on the d10. This would normally signal an Interrupt Scene that was
completely different from our expectations, but let's be real here, I don't
wanna. I spent months procrastrinating on this one because Foundry was being
cantakerous, only to sit find out that the Foundry things I needed to do only
took like 5 minutes with a bit of creativity. And now I want to do the thing I
prepared for.

Let's try to divine what an _altered_ scene would look like here, however. If
it's something cool I'll add it in.

- 1d10: 6 => Add an Object

- 2x1d100 on the Descriptions table: 83 & 54 = Positively Less

- 1d100 on the Object Elements table: Protection

Let's add a small magic item with protective qualities to the loot
available. It's probably being worn by Kossrani, and it's not armor. Let's make
it a Moly Amulet from DF Magic Items p. 9. +5 Magic Resistance when worn,
$23.600, 0.12kg.

Kinda expensive compared to what Pathfinder 1 characters should be getting at
this point, but I don't care.

# GM Hat: Preparation

Aside from the extra magic item, here is our disposition. [add map] I might need
to change the distribution of characters in there.

The front entrance is the big gate on map north. The small building to the east
is a dormitory for the night shift guards.

The rooms in the big western building are, from top to bottom: Front office,
break room, supply closet, and a big loading dock/work area that opens into the
circular oven. Wet salt is brought in and dry salt is shipped out from the big
double gate on the southern wall.

All external gates and all external doors on the western building are locked,
but the locks are Basic (+5 to Lockpicking) because this is a commercial
building and the mercs were too lazy to change the locks. The front office has
been cleared out to act as a prisoner dormitory (they sleep on rags spread over
the floor).

The CCG Thugs present here are not minions, but they still use their standard
stats. Kossrani is based on the Brute template and is fairly well-equipped.

Early in the morning, the salt works gets a big delivery of wet salt on a
cart. Early in the evening, another cart comes to pick up the dried salt. Late
at night, a smaller cart comes in to pick up the salt Kossrani is skimming off
the top to sell on the black market. All of this happens on the southern loading
gate.

There are also no kitchens or anything in the place, so they take meal
deliveries in a few hours after the early morning salt delivery and a couple of
hours before the evening pickup. These are delivered by a dottari patrol, and
consist of decent food for the guards and crappy rations for the prisoners.

The prisoners work with the salt during the day and sleep in the northern room
at night. There's always at least one guard keeping an eye on them. Kossrani and
four thugs keep watch by day while three thugs sleep. Those three keep watch at
night while the others sleep. Kossrani wakes up at night to deliver his
clandestine salt, then goes back to sleep.

# Player Hat: Planning

I think it's fair to assume that the PCs would have a planning meeting in the
Wasp Nest now that they know where Comerivos is.

My impulse as the player who has read the adventure is to have them watch the
place for a day to see who comes and goes, which would let them figure out the
salt delivery schedule, and use a delivery to storm the place. But I don't want
to go straight that way, as in a more "traditional" game the players wouldn't
know all this beforehand. Plus the PC's personalities might incline them towards
alternate approaches. How about we try to simulate these discussions using
Mythic and GURPS?

First, let's look at our PCs, and what their personalities and traits suggest
they'd prefer.

- **Arcturus** is Impulsive, so obviously he wants to charge in right now, beat
  everyone up, and heroically rescue the prisoners!

- **Jade** is concerned with doing this without risking harm to the prisoners,
  and a Tactics roll tells her it's best to watch the place for a while to spot
  openings in their security, and _then_ exploit those to charge in and rescue
  the prisoners.

- **Jania** is lazy and overconfident, so she's in favor of doing what has
  worked for her in the past: sneak in at night, pick the locks, and spring the
  prisoners quietly.

- **Rosalia** is also Impulsive, and is with Arcturus all the way.

- **Urist** is with Jade, as he's concerned about potential harm to the
  prisoners.

I roll **Diplomacy** for Jade with some aid from Urist's **Public Speaking**,
but I fail! Let's say they arrive at a compromise here. They'll forgo lengthy
scouting but they'll do a night-time raid because that's when the guards are
likely to be less alert.

They'll get in through the side gate and then the small side door towards the
back of the building, letting Jania open both and staying quiet for as long as
possible. Once inside, Arcturus and Jade will focus on fighting and distracting
the guards while the rest of them get the prisoners out.

That's it for the plan. No time for anything more elaborate, no time for
shopping expeditions. They move tonight.

# GM Hat: Reacting to the Plan

If the party is going to break in at night, I need to change the position of the
enemies on the map. Kossrani will be in the sleeping quarters, and a mook guard
will take his place.

Sleeping defenders don't have their armor on, but can fetch their weapons with a
single Ready maneuver after getting out of bed.

[show new map]

It's a bright starry night, so our Darkness modifier is -6 outside. There are
some lanterns inside the perimeter and buildings that provide torch-equivalent
illumination (zero penalty out to 3m, -3 out to 6m). We can assume the building
has small windows for lighting and ventilation, so at night the penalty for
unlit interiors is also a -6.

# Player Hat: The Raid

The party travels to the salt works, and approaches the side gate. Jania
conjures a **Light** and gets to work opening the lock. It readily clicks open
after a few seconds. Pleasantly surprised with how easy this has been so far,
the group sneaks across the courtyard, where she opens the other door just as
easily.


    Success on the spell, which costs her 1 Fatigue.

    For both doors, Open Locks gives her +4, this being a basic lock gives
    another +5, and she decides to rush a bit and get it done in half the time
    for -5. Our effective skill is 20! We succeed at both tries.

    Stealth is a group check, made with the highest skill (Jania's at 15) at a
    -1 penalty for each PC who doesn't have that skill (Urist). She succeeds,
    and the guards don't because there are several walls between them
    and the the PCs.

Opening the second door reveals a large but messy room where seven disheveled
people sleep on raggedy blankets. Rosalia and jade move forward to quietly wake
them up, figuring they have the best chance of doing so quietly. This is exactly
what happens, as they wake up each prisoner with soft words and and are readily
believed when they say they're here for a rescue. One of them even asks Jade if
she's an angel, which embarrasses her because she's not sure herself!

    Mythic, are these exhausted, stressed-out and malnourished
    prisoners going to make loud noises when suddenly woken up on the middle of
    the night (Likely)? Answer: No.

    Okay, so they're going to be able to see and react to our PCs before they
    make a noise. Let's say 4 of them see Rosalia, and 3 see Jade. They all
    react pretty well, as expected, with the lowest roll being a 15.

While the party was able to pretty much ghost into the building, they can hear
the sounds of people playing cards just beyond a corridor, and the prisoners are
unlikely to be able to sneak as well as they are, in their state. Jade decides
to take the rearguard here, and fight any guards that come in from the
south. Urist will stay just outside the door, while the rest attempt to sneak
out with the prisoners.

    That's another group test, but a much harder one. Let's consider Nan
    Comerivos has Stealth, since he's a smuggler, but none of the other
    prisoners do. So Jania's Stealth-15 has a -6 penalty here, and the guards
    have no penalty to their Hearing rolls.

    This is a tie! However, ties go to the "defender", which here means the
    guards.

Despite Jania's attempts to get this lot out safely, their shuffling attracts
the attention of one of the CCG thugs in the front room, which decides the
prisoners are being too noisy and goes over to rough them up a bit...

The PCs hear him coming, and decide to hurry up, abandoning stealth and
following their original plan. Jade and Art stay behind to tie up the guards
while the rest of the group books it.

    It's a fight! Let's say the PCs and prisoners get to make one move action
    before we enter combat order. Prisoners move with the PC side.

## Round 1:

The rescuer team and the prisoners begin running out of the building, intending
to go back through the courtyard and out the already open side gate. The guards
in the front room begin running towards the source of the noise, while the ones
in the dormitory (including Kossrani) begin waking up.

    Move actions all around, with the sleepyheads Doing Nothing.

## Round 2:

More running, as the sleepyheads begin getting up from their beds and the other
guards keep running to reach the back room. The prisoners and their escort are
halfway to crossing the courtyard. Jade and Art begin backing out of the room,
since it's very dark now.

## Round 3:

The sleepyheads gather their weapons, but have no time to put on any armor. The
prisoners are almost out of the courtyard. Rosalia, Jania, and Urist decide to
lag behind a bit because they heard the shouts from inside the dormitory. Jade
and Art hang by the exit door.

## Round 4:

Kossrani finally begins moving, and opens the dormitory door to find a bunch of
people running away throught the courtyard! Urist closes in to engage the new
threat, as another CCG thug emerges from the dormitory to approach him.

Most prisoners are out of the gate, but still on the map. The CCG thugs from the
building are almost closing in on the courtyard door.

## Round 5

Our first attack of the combat!

- CCG Thug 6 (out of 7) tries to whack Urist with his club but the dwarf blocks.

- Urist retorts with his mace, hitting the thug's torso for 5 injury, knocking
  him down and stunning him.

- Kossrani steps around the fallen guard and stands engaged with Rosalia and
  Urist in melee.

- Jania casts Grease right underneath Kossrani, who retains his footing but is
  now standing on difficult terrain.

- Thug 7 moves out of the dormitory and engages Urist.

- Rosalia uses Song of Humiliation on Kossrani, but he resists (both fail by 1,
  ties go to the defender). She thrusts with her saber but he blocks.

- Arthur runs and tackles Thug 7, grappling him for 8 control points!

- Jade Waits to stab the first enemy to enter her reach.

- The guards from the main building are almost at the door. All but two
  prisoners have escaped.

## Round 6

- Thug 6 manages to recover from Stun.

- Arthur strikes Thug 7 spending 6 CP to improve damage. Even so, he deals only
  4 injury.

- Thug 7

- Jania steps up to Thug 7 and hits him with her cane for another 5
  injury. Still up!

- Thug 5 finally runs out of the building, right into Jade's Wait. She stabs him
  in the vitals and kills him outright with 21 injury.

- Urist tries to bash Kossrani again, but he parries.

- Kossrani tries to return the favor, but Urist blocks and retreats 1 step.

- Rosalia steps to Kossrani's side and stabs him for 6 injury.

- Thug 1 tries to charge Jade but misses.

- Jade swings twice at Thug 1's legs, hits once for 6 injury, crippling the leg
  and knocking the thug down. Still in the fight, though.

- The last bystander escapes.

- Remaining thugs keep running up to die against Jade's blade.

I interrupted the game right about then and when I restarted Thug 7 seemed to
actually have taken enough damage to be knocked out of the fight, so I went with
that. Arthur released him on the ground.

## Round 7

- Thug 6 kneels from prone...

- ... only to be grappled and violently tossed right on top of his already
  unconscious buddy, losing consciousness in the process. Arthur smiles
  gallantly and points at Kossrani: you're next!

- Kossrani attempts to bash Rosalia with his shield, since she's the only one
  who actually wounded him so far. She dodges and retreats.

- Urist steps forward and attacks Kossrani with his mace. Kossrani blocks.

- Jade Irinka beheads Thug 1, who had just sat up, and stabs Thug 5 through the
  heart!

- Rosalia tries to stab Kossrani again but he parries.

- Thug 4, the final surviving guard who wasn't yet engaged, flanks Jade!

- Jania casts Ice Dagger with a critical success, charging it with 2 energy
  points at no cost to herself.


## Round 8

- Thug 4 tries to attack Jade but misses.

- Jania fires off her Ice Dagger but kossrani dodges.

- Kossrani tries to bash Arthur, who performs a Grabbing Parry and moves in to
  strenghten his grapple. Kossrani manages to fend him off with his shield, but
  his mace arm is still grappled.

- Urist and Rosalia try to strike Kossrani but even grappled he's awfully dodgy.

- Jade steps back and cuts Thug 4 for 7 injury.

## Round 9

- The wounded thug misses Jade.
- Art fails to strenghten his grapple.
- Kossrani escapes his grapple, but is still in close combat.
- Rosalia tries to attack him and drops her weapon!
- Jania steps forward with her cane and finally lands a hit on Kossrani for 6
  injury.
- Urist critically hits Kossrani with is mace and finally takes him out.

## Post-Combat

With Kossrani down, the remaining guards immediately turn tail and run back
inside the building, intent on running away. Jade lets them, as she recognizes
they are defeated and sees no honor or utility in chasing them.

The prisoners have all escaped, and now it's time for the group to escape with
them... after a quick spot of looting where they take Kossrani's
amulet. Everyone meets up soon after, as the prisoners didn't have enough energy
to run very far. Together the group re-enters the walls and finds a spot to rest
away from patrols, and then they all make their way back to the Long Roads
Coffee House without further incident.

# GM Hat: Consequences

As stated in the book, each attempted raid on the salt works increases notoriety
by 1d4. This one increased it by 2. There will be no others, at least for now,
the place was emptied out.

We haven't started dealing with rebellion rules yet, due to the different order
in which we're running these scenes, but we will do so on the next chapter.
