Anime is both an industry and an art form, much like cinema in general. It's
subject to the whims of both market and maker, and you can notice clear trends
that surface and vanish over time if you look at the set of shows that come out
each season.

A trend or genre of anime that's been popular for a while now are _isekai_
shows. "Isekai" means something like "another world", and the term is usually
applied to shows where the main character is somehow transported from
current-day Japan to a fantasy setting of some description.

This type of story is not a recent invention at all, of course. It's existed for
decades in science fiction and fantasy literature, even in the West, where it's
sometimes known as "Portal Fantasy". A famous historical example are the Barsoom
novels, in which John Carter is transported to Mars and lives a life of adventure.
