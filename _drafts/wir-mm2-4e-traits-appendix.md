Like the first Monster Manual before it, the Monster Manual 2 ends with a short
appendix containing rules for using some of the humanoids from the book as
playable characters. This one is a lot smaller than the MM's appendix, and I
don't think any of the races in it got much in the way of subsequent support or
more complete versions.

The three writeups and their notable traits are listed below.

- **Bullywugs** have Swamp Walk and get Primordial as a bonus language. Their
  racial power is the Rancid Air aura from their monster writeups.

- **Duergar** are predictably similar to dwarves, but they get Deep Speech as a
  bonus language and the Infernal Quills racial power.

- **Kenku** get the Flock Effect and Mimicry abilities from their monster
  writeups, but don't have any bonus languages. Flock Effect is a pretty awesome
  ability for a rogue.

And with this we can finally close the MM2, and move on to the next book in my
planned series. See you on the Monster Manual 3 Let's Read!
