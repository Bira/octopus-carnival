The text is generally a bit more progressive in places than the 2005 GURPS core
book. Small wording changes here and there, but I find them welcome.

Also this is very clearly still a pre-release text, I expect it to change and
get more organized as time goes by and we approach the date of the print
release.

Of course, the big one is how the core invention system has been replaced by the
Spark (which is a mix of those rules and a form of Magery). Gadgeteer costs 10
points (down from 25) and Quick Gadgeteer costs 25 (down from 50). You gain the
former at no extra cost if you have Spark 1+ and the later if you have Spark 4+
(Agatha, Gil, and Tarvek have Spark 4, Lucrezia and the Baron have 5). They only
affect your speed - it's the Spark that allows fantastic inventions.

The Appearance advantage is about being impressive rather than sexy. This was an
alternate rule in baseline GURPS, but it's the default and the only option
here. The other end of the spectrum was named "repulsive" rather than
"ugly". +1/-1 to reactions per 4 points spend or gained from it, regardless of
the gender or sexual orientation of whoever's looking.

Combat skill and rules changes/simplifications:

Weapon Master is in (Zeetha is a Weapon Master) but Trained by a Master is out.

The "Karate" skill has been renamed Martial Arts, though it still covers the
same territory as before (formal training in unarmed strikes with hands and
feet).

There are no grappling skills whatsoever. It's all raw DX or ST, and the
grappling rules are the bare minimum that fits inside a small text box.

The Retreat option is out. Fencing skills instead give you a +2 to Parry, and
Martial Arts' benefit is not getting penalized when you parry weapons.

Beam Weapons, Guns and Gunner no longer have separate specialties, the same
skill allows you to shoot all covered weapons equally well.

You still have a lot of melee weapon skills, though.

Melee weapons and low-tech ranged weapons resemble those of the Dungeon Fantasy
RPG. We also get a few steampunky guns, grenades, and cannon.

Armor table is similar to the DFRPG's but a bit simpler. There's also a Powered
Armor table!
