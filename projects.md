Most posts in these blogs aren't isolated, but instead are part of a larger set
of thematically-linked articles. This page will collect and list this projects,
for ease of reference.

Octopus Carnival has _two_ ongoing projects at the moment:

- [GURPS Dragon's Dogma][1]: A complete adaptation of the eponymous video game
  into a GURPS setting appropriate for Dungeon Fantasy campaigns.
- [GURPS X-COM Play Reports][3]: A retelling of a campaign I ran for
  about a year on the RPG.net forum.

And also one completed project:

- [Pathfinder Iconics in Dungeon Fantasy][2]: A group of Pathfinder's Iconics
  converted into immediately playable Dungeon Fantasy characters.

These links lead to project pages that in turn contain links to all relevant
posts in order. Enjoy!
