Most posts in these blogs aren't isolated, but instead are part of a larger set
of thematically-linked articles. This page will collect and list this projects,
for ease of reference.

Octopus Carnival has one ongoing project at the moment:

- [GURPS Dragon's Dogma][1]

And also one completed project:

- [Pathfinder Iconics in Dungeon Fantasy][2]

These links lead to project pages that in turn contain links to all relevant
posts in order. Enjoy!
