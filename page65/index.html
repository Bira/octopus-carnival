<p>Death Giants are a 3.x creation, first appearing in one of that edition’s
Monster Manual 2 or 3. For 4e, they get a new backstory. They appear only on the
Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Back at the dawn of creation when the titans were exploring the world, some of
them found their way to the Shadowfell and liked the place so much they moved
there permanently along with their giant children and allowed the energies of
the place to permeate their beings. And that’s how the first death titans and
giants came to be.</p>

<p>These giants have entirely abandoned their elemental nature and their allegiance
to the primordials, and are now fully creatures of the Shadowfell. They’re
probably also the world’s biggest fans of death metal. Though they stick mostly
to their native plane, they will sometimes live in the world in places like
graveyards and necropoli where the wall between the two planes is thin.</p>

<p>Death giants derive their power and sustenance from the souls of living
creatures. They don’t need to consume souls very often, but they still enjoy
hunting for sport and most of them are surrounded by a shroud of trapped,
wailing spirits waiting their turn to be lunch.</p>

<p>They’re fairly intelligent, but my impression is they’re not too fond of banding
together in large groups. They frequently associate with undead or with
necromantic cults that like performing sacrifices. The latter provide a steady
source of nutrition, since a death giant doesn’t need to personally kill someone
to trap their soul - the victim just has to die near the giant.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Death giants and titans are Large and Huge Shadow Humanoids with the Giant
keyword. They have Darkvision, resistance to necrotic damage, and an Aura 5 that
captures the soul of anyone who dies in range. They can spend these captured
souls to power some of their abilities. Their typical Int score is 12, making
them the smartest giants we’ve seen so far, and their alignment is Evil.</p>

<p>We get two stat blocks here, one for the giant and one for the titan, but you
can use the guidelines above to make your own.</p>

<h3 id="death-giant">Death Giant</h3>

<p>This is a Level 22 Brute with 255 HP. It has Resist 15 Necrotic and a speed
of 7. It wears mail and wields a greataxe.</p>

<p>The greataxe is Reach 2 and does physical damage with he High Crit property,
suffering from the damage bug. The giant’s most distinctive powers come from its
soul shroud.</p>

<p>Anyone who dies within 5 squares of a death giant adds one soul shard to its
shroud. No detail on whether this “shard” is a whole soul or a literal shard of
one. If it’s the latter, then a single death might add shards to multiple giants
if their auras overlap.</p>

<p>In any case, you can assume a death giant starts the fight with 4 shards in its
shroud unless your story demands otherwise. It can consume one shard to heal 20
HP, or spend it to power a Soulfire Burst (Close Burst 1 vs. Reflex) that does
necrotic damage and could <em>really</em> use a damage fix. If the giant’s shroud ever
runs out of shards, it takes a -2 penalty to its attacks until it can add more.</p>

<p>Since a being has to <em>die</em> to add a shard to the giant’s shroud, I think it’s
one of those monsters that has an incentive to finish off downed PCs. It also
pairs really well with minions, and you might also want to add some minion-like
innocent victims in your battlefield that the PCs would have an extra incentive
to protect.</p>

<h3 id="death-titan">Death Titan</h3>

<p>This is a Level 25 Elite Brute with 574 HP. Its aura works the same as that of
the death giant, and also inflicts a -2 penalty to the attacks of any enemies
within. Its necrotic resistance is 30, and its speed is 8.</p>

<p>Death titans wear plate and fight with Huge greataxes, which are Reach 3 and
have the High Crit property. They can attack twice per action with these axes.</p>

<p>The death titan’s soul shroud works the same way as that of the giant, but the
titan doesn’t need to wait for people to die around it! It has an ability called
Soul Devourer (Ranged 5 vs. Fortitude), which takes a bite off the soul of an
enemy, causing it to lose a healing surge and adding one soul shard to the
titan’s shroud. An excellent power to use from a distance while the titan’s
buddies engage in melee.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter in the MM is level 24: 1 death titan, 2 death giants, 1
voidsoul specter and 1 deathpriest hierophant.</p>

<p>IIRC, the deathpriest hierophant is tied to Orcus, the demon lord of undeath
(we’ll get to him in time). So perhaps you could say that in your campaign,
death giants were originally created by the primordial who became Orcus, and
that their transformation happened at the same time as that of their master.</p>

<p>Fire giants make up the final members of the “Against the Giants” trio. Like
their frosty cousins they’re inspired by Norse mythology, but their D&amp;D
incarnation is a lot less viking-ish. They’re present on both books.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Fire giants have legendary reputations as builders and metalworkers, which makes
sense since every object usable by a fire giant has to be made of heat-resistant
metal or stone. They live in castles and fortified cities build around (and
atop, and under) active volcanoes or other sources of heat and magma.</p>

<p>These giants pine more strongly for their ancient glory days than most of their
kin, and engage in active empire-building instead of settling for simple
raiding. They make ample use of slaves, chief among which are the azer descended
from dwarves that didn’t manage to break free from them. They’ll enslave other
peoples just as readily though.</p>

<p>While still members of Team Primordial fire giants are typically Evil, probably
reflecting their more organized approach to life.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Fire giants are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Giant keyword, and their
titan bosses are Huge. They have 15 resistance resistance to fire, with titans
being more resistant. Like other giants their land speed is 8. Both fire giants
and titans have a typical Int score of 10.</p>

<p>They’re stronger than frost giants, but not by much. You can consider both types
to be evenly matched.</p>

<h3 id="fire-giant-flamecrusher-mv">Fire Giant Flamecrusher (MV)</h3>

<p>This is a Level 17 Brute with 204 HP and all common traits outlined above. It
fights with a Searing Maul (Melee 2 vs. AC) that does a big chunk of fire
damage, and which can also be used in an Overhead Smash (Melee 2 vs. AC) that
does about the same damage and knocks the target prone.</p>

<p>Once bloodied, the flamecrusher gains the ability to flip out and deal a series
of Battering Blows to everyone around him (Close Burst 2 vs. AC), which do more
damage than the basic attack and push targets 2 squares. This is an encounter
power, but it recharges if the giant misses every target with it.</p>

<h3 id="fire-giant-both">Fire Giant (Both)</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 18 Soldier with 174 HP and all fire giant traits. It
wears giant-sized mail and fights with a Searing Greatsword that does fire
damage and marks for a turn on a hit. It can also sweep it in a wide arc (Close
Blast 2 vs. AC), dealing the same damage as the basic attack and marking anyone
it hits for a turn.</p>

<p>The MM version is nearly identical. Aside from suffering from the damage bug, it
can also throw Iron Javelins (Ranged 15/30 vs. AC), which do physical damage and
slow for a turn when they hit. Apparently fire giants are too sophisticated to
throw mere rocks. Personally, I’d add this attack to the MV version too.</p>

<h3 id="fire-giant-forgecaller-both">Fire Giant Forgecaller (Both)</h3>

<p>The spellcaster of the family, it’s Level 18 Artillery with 136 HP and training
in Perception. The Forgecaller fights in melee with a Smoldering Mace (Melee 2
vs. AC) that does fire damage, and uses All The Fire to fight at range.</p>

<p>This can take the form of a single-target Pillar of Flame (Ranged 20 vs. Reflex)
that does more fire damage than the mace, or an area-effect Flame Burst (Area 2
within 10 vs. Reflex; Recharge 6) which does both immediate and ongoing fire
damage (save ends), half of both on a miss.</p>

<h3 id="fire-titan-both">Fire Titan (Both)</h3>

<p>The fire titan is a Level 21 Elite Soldier with 398 HP. The MM version has 30
Fire Resistance, and the MV version upgrades that to complete immunity. Its
speed is 8. Like other titans, it’s mostly made up of its totemic element, with
magma skin and bonfire hair.</p>

<p>The titan fights with a Fiery Greatsword (Melee 3 vs. AC) which does a big glob
of fire damage, pushes 2 squares on a hit, and marks for a turn. It can make two
of these basic attacks per action.</p>

<p>It can also attack at range by hurling gobs of lava (Ranged 20 vs. Reflex;
recharge 5-6), which do fire damage, immobilize for a turn, and cause flying
targets to fall. On a miss they still do half damage and immobilize for a
turn. The MM version explicitly states this requires a source of lava, something
which the MV version omits. Considering the places where you’re likely to find a
fire titan, a source of lava should always be available! If it’s not, I suppose
it can just spit on its hand and throw that.</p>

<p>Finally the titan can project a Burning Wave (Close Burst 5 vs. Reflex),
presumably by flexing. This does immediate and ongoing fire damage to everyone
it hits. The MM version does half the immediate damage on a miss.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>We have two on the MM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 2 fire giants, 1 forgecaller, 1 azer beastlord, and 2 firebred hell
hounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 22: 1 fire titan, 2 fire giants, 2 fire archon ash disciples, and 1
phoenix.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Other creatures you’re likely to find in encounter group with fire giants would
include elementals with at least some fire in their composition, and red
dragons.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Fire giants are mechanically simpler than I expected, which I guess is a theme
for all the classic giants. They deal fire damage almost exclusively, so you
might want to change that if the party has very strong fire protection. I’d
probably give the basic fire giant a way to punish people who ignore its marks,
as I feel the -2 penalty for attacking other enemies isn’t enough deterrence at
these levels.</p>

<p>Frost giants are based on the Jotuns of nordic folklore, and these roots
translate into them being the most viking-like of all D&amp;D giants. They’ve been a
part of the game since its beginnings. Frost giants appear on the Monster Vault
but not on the Monster Manual - they would appear on the MM2. We’ll skip ahead a
bit and look at the stat blocks from both the MV and the MM2.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Frost giants live atop permafrost-coated mountains or at extremely high
latitudes (normally referred to as the Frigid North but there’s no reason it
couldn’t be the Icy South in your world). They carve their holds and fortresses
out of the ice, and their rulers are known as jarls.</p>

<p>Frost giant culture is all about bravery and martial prowess, so when food in
the surrounding area begins growing scarce, or when the itch for a fight just
becomes too strong, their warriors gather and go out raiding for plunder,
slaves, and glory. When they return, the skalds sing of their bravery and of how
much loot they got. Much like historical vikings, frost giants are assholes.</p>

<p>As members of Team Primordial who love raiding and looting, they are typically
Chaotic Evil.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Frost giants are significantly stronger than hill giants, enough that a party
that’s going through a 4e version of Against the Giants might have a bit of
trouble when they first get to them. In earlier editions, Stone Giants stood
between Hill and Frost - this is still true here, but stone giants appear only
on the MM2 and so we’ll look at them much later.</p>

<p>Frost giants are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Cold and Giant
keywords. Frost titans are similar, but Huge. They all move at Speed 8 with Ice
Walk, which means they ignore terrain penalties from ice and snow. Frost giants
have Resist 15 Cold, and the titan is completely immune. They are <em>not</em>
particularly vulnerable to fire. They have a typical Int score of 10.</p>

<p>Their other signature trait is Icebound Footing, which allows them to ignore a
number of squares of forced movement (2 for giants, 4 for the titan) and make a
saving throw to avoid being knocked prone. This is essentially a more powerful
version of the trait PC dwarves get.</p>

<h3 id="frost-giant-both">Frost Giant (Both)</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 17 Brute with 201 HP and all standard frost giant
traits. You can expect most individuals you face to use this stat block.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is an Icy Greataxe (Melee 2 vs. AC) that does quite a bit of
cold damage and has High Critical, meaning it does a <em>lot</em> more damage on a
critical hit. It can also empower this axe with even more cold magic for a
Chilling Strike (recharge 5-6), which does more damage than a non-critical basic
attack and inflicts Vulnerable 10 Cold on the target (save ends).</p>

<p>The MM2 version still suffers from the damage bug, and has a couple more
abilities: Dying Swipe allows it to make one last basic attack when it dies, and
it can throw Icy Handaxes (Ranged 5/10 vs. AC) if melee isn’t an option for some
reason. These have probably been removed from the MV version because of the next
entry.</p>

<h3 id="frost-giant-marauder-mv">Frost Giant Marauder (MV)</h3>

<p>The fast, wiry cousin of the basic frost giant is a Level 17 Skirmisher with 168
HP and all common frost giant traits. It trades the big axe for a brace of 8
hand axes, which it can throw or dual-wield.</p>

<p>Indeed, the marauder’s basic attack can be either Melee 2 or Ranged 10, both
vs. AC. It does a bit of cold damage and allows the giant to shift 2 squares as
an effect.</p>

<p>It can also employ a Twin Strike at will, performing two basic attacks and
shifting 2 squares between them. This replaces the “shift 2 squares” effect, as
I understand it.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the marauder can perform a Hurling Charge, throwing two
handaxes and then charging one of the targets of those throws.</p>

<h3 id="frost-giant-ice-shaper-mm2">Frost Giant Ice Shaper (MM2)</h3>

<p>This spellcaster is a Level 19 Controller (Leader) with 182 HP and all common
frost giant traits. Its magic likely involves a lot of runes.</p>

<p>The ice shaper fights in melee with a Freezing Flail (Melee 2 vs. AC) that does
cold damage, and at range with Freezing Bolts (Ranged 20 vs. Reflex) which do
cold damage and immobilize. As a minor action it can use Ice Slide (Ranged 10
vs. Fortitude) to slide someone 3 squares without doing damage.</p>

<p>Its “special” spells are Wall of Frost (Area Wall 12 within 10), which does what
it says on the tin: it fills up 12 contiguous squares with a semi-solid frost
barrier that provides some concealment, counts as difficult terrain, and does 5
damage to people who start their turn adjacent to the wall or 15 to those who
enter it. This lasts for a turn but the giant can spend minor actions to sustain
it. It’s also Recharge 6, which means it might be able to cast it more than once
in the battle.</p>

<p>The other spell is Ice Armor (recharge 5-6) which grants one ally within 10
squares Resist 10 to all damage for a turn.</p>

<h3 id="frost-titan-both">Frost Titan (Both)</h3>

<p>The Frost Titan is a Level 20 Elite Brute with 466 HP, and is literally made of
ice. As such, it’s completely immune to cold and its Icebound Footing trait
prevents up to 4 squares of forced movement. The MV version has a weakness to
fire, gaining -2 AC for a turn when it takes fire damage. The MM2 has no such
weakness.</p>

<p>The frost titan’s breath is cold enough that it works as an Aura 2, turning
every square in range into difficult terrain and causing 5 cold damage to
enemies that start their turn inside.</p>

<p>The Titan fights with an Icy Greataxe (Melee 3 vs. AC), which does both
immediate and ongoing cold damage (save ends), and has High Critical. It can
focus its icy breath once per encounter (Close Blast 5 vs. Reflex), which does
cold damage, ongoing cold damage (save ends), and immobilizes for a turn. A miss
does half damage.</p>

<p>As a minor action it can use a Cold-Blooded Kick (Melee 3 vs. Reflex), which is
actually a bit stronger than the axe, pushes the target 2 squares, and knocks it
prone. Fortunately it doesn’t have High Critical or ongoing damage.</p>

<p>When the Frost Titan is reduced to 0 HP, it can make one last axe strike.</p>

<p>The MM2 version can also fling ice bolts (Ranged 20 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6)
against one or two creatures which do cold damage and slow (save ends) on a
hit.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The MM2 has two encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 19: 2 basic frost giants, 1 ice shaper, 1 remorhaz.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 21: 2 frost titans, 2 ice archon frostshapers, 1 ice archon rimehammer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That gives you a general idea of the things that partner with frost giants and
titans: big monsters who live in the same cold places as them, and ice archons
or other primordial forces.</p>

<p>They would likely <em>not</em> be very friendly with the likes of ice devils, demons,
or winter fae. This gives you some ready-to-go rival factions to use in your
cold dungeons if you like that.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I imagine people complained that frost giants weren’t present in the first MM,
since they’re an important part of the classic D&amp;D bestiary. These ones seem
like suitably fearsome opponents, though. Cold-damage brutes that can make you
vulnerable to cold as a basic infantry unit? Yikes!</p>

<p>The MV versions are generally superior because of their damage fixes and more
focused stat blocks, but the ice shaper fills a nice niche that seems to be
missing from the MV stat blocks.</p>

<p>The “Earth Giants” designation is new to 4th edition, but the monsters that make
up most of them are not. In other words, this is going to be a post about Hill
Giants. They’ve been in D&amp;D since the start and are present in both books in
this edition.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Like all of the other giant categories, the “Earth Giant” designation covers the
Titans aligned with the element of Earth and the giant servitors they
created. While both are technically among the weakest of their kind, they can
still pose an existential threat to most kingdoms of Medium-or-smaller humanoids
if they manage to organize, and even a small group is a serious threat.</p>

<p>The Titans are very obviously creatures of Earth, resembling humanoid
mountains made out of earth and rock. While they created several types of giant,
the most common variety is known as the Hill Giant from its preferred
environment.</p>

<p>Hill Giants are so much more aligned to the world than to the Elemental Chaos
that they resemble big people. Big, dumb, violent people. I believe hill giants
are inspired by the giants you see in some fairy tales, of the kind that walks
in from somewhere and begins eating people’s goats until some clever tailor
comes in and kills them through trickery.</p>

<p>While D&amp;D hill giants aren’t much smarter than the ones in the fairy tales,
they’re quite a bit harder to defeat, particularly because they’re only alone if
you’re lucky. Hill giant communities are villages built out of mud and logs, and
may feature a chief that decided to copy the sophisticated ways of their tiny
neighbors, style themselves a king or queen, and begin demanding tribute.</p>

<p>Hill giants fight with Stone Age weapons, which are still quite deadly due to
their size and the strength of their wielders. They also have excellent throwing
arms and are able to hurl boulders with more accuracy than a catapult. They are
Chaotic Evil on account of being on Team Primordial, but if it’s possible for a
Friendly Giant who is Unaligned or Good to exist at all, they’re probably from
this branch of the family.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Hill Giants are Large Natural Humanoids with the Earth and Giant keywords. They
have a typical Int score of 7, making them stupid but still capable of tactics
and coordination. Earth Titans are Huge Elemental Humanoids with the same
keywords and a typical Int of 10.</p>

<h3 id="hill-giant-both">Hill Giant (Both)</h3>

<p>The classic model is a Level 13 Brute with 159 HP. Its long legs give it a land
Speed of 8. The versions from both books are identical, with the only difference
being that the MV one has updated damage totals.</p>

<p>Hill giants attack with a club, which might be something like a tree trunk. Once
per encounter they can make a Sweeping Club attack, which allows them to attack
two targets, push then 2 squares, and knock them prone in addition to doing club
damage.</p>

<p>They can also hurl rocks out to Range 10, which does a bit less damage than the
club but is still respectable. Ammunition comes from the landscape, and if no
handy boulders are available the giant still carries around 5 of them in its
satchel.</p>

<h3 id="hill-giant-hunter-mv">Hill Giant Hunter (MV)</h3>

<p>This giant is Level 13 Artillery with 109 HP. A bit more sophisticated than its
basic cousin, it fights with javelins that it uses in melee or as ranged weapons
(Range 20). I imagine these are sculpted from smaller trees, though the wooden
palisade of your typical human village would also provide plenty of ammunition
in a pinch.</p>

<p>The hunter is still a hill giant, so it also throws rocks out to Range 20 for
about double the damage of a javelin, an attack that recharges on a 5-6. Its
loadout is about 6 javelins and 4 rocks, though as mentioned before the
surrounding landscape can provide additional ammo if needed.</p>

<h3 id="hill-giant-earth-shaman-mv">Hill Giant Earth Shaman (MV)</h3>

<p>This earthbending spellcaster is a Level 13 Controller (Leader) with 131
HP. All if its attacks are some form of magic.</p>

<p>Its basic melee attack is the Earthgrip Slam (Melee 2 vs. AC), which does damage
and restrains for a turn on a hit. Once per encounter it can cast Earthen Chains
(Ranged 10 vs. Reflex), which does a little bit of damage, stuns (save ends),
and pulls the target to the ground if it was flying. The first time one of the
giant’s allies hits the stunned target, it heals 15 HP.</p>

<p>It also has another spell named Earth Wave (recharge 5-6; Close Blast 5
vs. Fortitude; enemies only). On a hit, this does a bit of damage and pushes
targets 2 squares. As an <em>effect</em>, it automatically knocks all targets prone,
and allows every ally in the blast to shift up to 3 squares and make a basic
melee attack. Just the thing to use when leading a pack of those hill giant
brutes.</p>

<h3 id="earth-titan-both">Earth Titan (Both)</h3>

<p>Earth Titans have nearly identical stats in both books, the main difference
being their damage (which has been increased in the MV). They’re Level 16 Elite
Brutes with 384 HP.</p>

<p>An earth titan’s basic melee attack is a powerful Reach 3 Slam, and it can make
two of those as a standard action. It can also hurl rocks out to Range 20, which
do damage and daze (save ends) on a hit. Once per encounter it can stomp really
hard and use Earth Shock (Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude), which does damage and
stuns for a turn on a hit, and does half damage with no riders on a miss.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The MM gives us two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 3 hill giants and 1 displacer beast packlord. The displacer beast is
the smartest of the bunch!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: 1 Earth Titan, 2 Hill Giants, 2 War Trolls, and 4 Ogre Bludgeoneers
(minions). This looks like what might await the Level 13 party at the end of
the Steading of the Hill Giant (or Earth Titan) Chief.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Hill Giants are suitable opponents for early Paragon heroes, and yet their
attacks are simple enough that you could run several of them without too much
mental effort. Their pair well with galeb duhrs (which they still enslave), or
with other paragon-tier creatures that might inhabit their preferred hills,
mountains and canyons. That does potentially include dragons!</p>

<p>The MV gives us enough stat blocks that we can build a large variety of
encounter groups made up entirely (or mostly) of hill giants, which is perfect
for the GM who wants to adapt the first Against the Giants adventure to 4e.</p>

<p>Giants are present in D&amp;D since the beginning, making up one of the games most
famous “monster ladders”. How famous? It got a whole module trilogy to itself,
named Against the Giants, which got reprised and homaged in several editions
after its debut on AD&amp;D 1st Edition. You could have named the game Gaols &amp;
Giants without changing anything else, and no one would find it odd that they’re
in the title.</p>

<p>As you’d expect from monsters with such an exalted pedigree, they are present in
both books. Between both of them we have no less than six giant types, each with
multiple stat blocks, so I’m going to give a general overview of giant-kind
in this post and cover each type in its own installment.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-origin-of-giants">On the Origin of Giants</h2>

<p>Giants in 4e all share a common origin: they were among the first beings created
by the primordials, stepping out into the newly-created world before it had even
cooled from the forge. Their purpose in life was to assist their masters in
exploring and shaping this new creation. This means they could dispute the
efreets’ claims of being the firsborn children of the Primordials, if they cared
to.</p>

<p>Well, if you want to get technical about it, the beings created directly by the
primordials are <em>Titans</em>. They they embody the qualities of the Elemental Chaos
to such a degree that their bodies are made of elemental matter instead of that
gross meat stuff. The Titans went about their mission for a while, but
eventually found out that the world was too large for them to do it
efficiently. So they created servitors of their own to help them in turn.</p>

<p>These servitors are the Giants proper. They’re smaller than their titanic
progenitors, and made of flesh and bone because they’re more closely aligned
with the world than with the Elemental Chaos. (From this point on, I’m using
capital-G Giants to mean both titans and giants).</p>

<p>In the course of their mission, the Giants multiplied and spread throughout the
world and the planes, and when the Primordials retreated from the world they
inherited it, and created one of its first empires. It was around this time that
the creations of the gods began to appear, and the Giants were already there to
enslave them. Most notable among these slaves were the dwarves, children of
Moradin, whose entire population endured a centuries-long period of cruel
servitude.</p>

<p>When the Dawn War started, the titans and giants sided with the
primordials. Though there weren’t many of them, their immense individual power
gave them victory in many battles, filling their castles with pillaged
loot. Attrition from the long war took its toll even on these mighty beings,
though, allowing the sudden dwarven rebellion to succeed and deal the final blow
to their empire.</p>

<p>Today’s giants are still sore about their downfall. They dream of casting down
the gods and rebuilding what they had, but they never managed to organize enough
to pull it off in all the intervening millenia. Today they live in scattered and
isolated communities, who fight each other as much as they terrorize the
surrounding small ‘uns. The causes for all this infighting are a bit opaque and
convoluted. They probably stretch back long enough that those Viking tales of
multi-decade feuds sound quaint to a giant.</p>

<h2 id="giant-stat-overview">Giant Stat Overview</h2>

<p>The most famous giant and titan signature trait is that they’re really big!
Giants are on the larger end of Large, and Titans cross over into Huge. All of
them have the Giant keyword as well, and though most giants have the Elemental
origin due to the story above, there are some interesting exceptions. Each giant
type has further signature traits that will be discussed in their own posts.</p>

<p>Level-wise, they range from early Paragon to late Epic tier. Within that range,
giants are usually regulars, with Titans being both Elite and a few levels
stronger than their corresponding giants.</p>

<p>Between the Monster Manual and the Monster Vault, we get the following giant
types, arranged from weakest to strongest: Earth, Ice, Fire, Death and
Storm. Each type presents one or more giant stat blocks and one Titan.</p>

<p>That first category includes Hill Giants - Stone giants also exist and fall
under Earth, but don’t appear in the first Monster Manual or on the Vault.</p>

<p>The first three rungs of this ladder comprise the Against the Giants set, which
means those modules could make a fine Paragon-tier campaign for 4e.</p>
