<p>Ice devils are native to Cania, the frozen eight layer of Hell. Also known as
Gelugons, they have an insectoid look which is significantly different from the
norm for devils. This makes me think they were a different type of creature than
most other rebellious divine servants (who were likely angels or such).</p>

<p>Individually they’re quite powerful, and hierarchically they’re starting to hit
“upper management” territory. Gelugons don’t just allow themselves to be
summoned by <em>anyone</em>. Their usual clients include evil rulers or generals. They
usually function as champions, elite guards, and troop commanders.</p>

<p>Unfortunately ice devils are not all that good at this command business, because
their disdain for their subordinates makes them favor high-attrition wave
tactics. Well, unfortunately for those subordinates of course. Gelugons must
think it’s really fun. Think “40K Imperial Guard Officer” when roleplaying them
and you won’t go wrong.</p>

<p>They like cold climates, but aren’t impaired by warmer ones as they take a bit
of Cania’s cold with them wherever they go. They like to fight in the front
lines even when commanding others, and will prefer to target the weakest
opponents first both because that’s tactically sound and because they despise
weakness.</p>

<p>Gelugons are present in both the Monster Manual and the Vault, and there are
signifitant differences between the two versions. We’ll cover them separately.</p>

<p>In both cases they’re Large Immortal Humanoids, have the Evil alignment (like
all devils), Int 15, and speak Supernal.</p>

<h2 id="ice-devil-monster-manual">Ice Devil (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The MM ice devil is a Level 20 Soldier with 195 HP. It has darkvision and runs
at speed 8. It’s completely immune to cold, and has Resist Fire 20. Pretty much
all of its powers are tagged with the Cold keyword.</p>

<p>First there’s the Cold Aura, which has a radius of 5 and gives enemies inside a
-2 penalty to attack rolls. Then there’s the Icy Longspear, a Reach 3 basic
attack that does cold damage and slows on a hit (save ends). Freezing Breath
targets Fortitude on a close blast 5, does cold damage and slows (save ends). It
recharges on 3-6. And finally there’s Chilling Command, a minor action that
recharges on 5-6 and targets Will. On a hit it does ongoing 5 cold damage and
immobilizes (save ends both).</p>

<p>5 ongoing damage is low for an almost-epic creature. I imagine this is
counterbalanced by the immobilization and this being a minor action. I’d
increase it to 10 or 15 anyway, as well as fixing the woefully low damage of all
the other attacks above.</p>

<p>Oh, these things also have claws, but they’re so bad as an attack that you might
as well ignore them. Devils use weapons.</p>

<p>The sample encounter here level 19: 2 ice devils, 2 cambion hellfire magi, and 2
nabassu gargoyles. Hard to say who’s in charge on that one. I’m guessing it’s a
very tense relationship between the gelugons and the cambions, all of whom are
under orders from some epic-level villain to cooperate or else.</p>

<h2 id="ice-devil-monster-vault">Ice Devil (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The MV ice devil has the same level, HP and defenses as the previous
version. The main difference are its attacks.</p>

<p>The puny claws are gone, as is Chilling Command. The damage on the Icy Longspear
and Freezing Breath has been fixed and further increased for the breath, which
now recharges on a 4-6. The spear now marks for a turn instead of slowing, and
the first failed save on the breath’s slow effect increases it to
immobilization.</p>

<p>The Cold Aura has been replaced by a new Aura 2 named Crippling Cold, which
slows for a turn any enemies who start their turns inside it. And finally, the
gelugon has replaced its fire resistance with a weakness to fire! Every time it
takes fire damage, its Crippling Cold aura deactivates until the ice devil
reactivates it. I <em>guess</em> that’s a minor action? It should at least be something
it can only do on its turn.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think I actually like the MM version a bit more here. Chilling command is
flavorful, and having the monster be both immune to cold and highly resistant to
fire can lead to a nice “gotcha” moment while still being easier to remember
than 3e devil resistances.</p>

<p>So to make my “optimal” gelugon I would start from the MV stat block, remove
Warming Weakness, add the 20 fire resistance, and the Chilling Command power.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Chain Devils, also known as kytons, are the official jailers and torturers of
Hell. They’re also quite popular in many tables because of their striking looks,
which are that of a human wrapped in spiked chains anchored to its flesh like
percings. Kytons can animate and control these chains at will. In combat, they
prefer to capture their foes alive and drag them back to their dungeons for a
days-long torture session before finally killing these victims and claiming
their souls. Their fighting style is not unlike a spinning dance, moving deftly
around the battlefield and whipping people with spiked chains.</p>

<p>Some chain devils learn rituals that allow them to control chains not attached
to their bodies, which is an excellent excuse for the GM to fill a battlefield
with chain-based hazards.</p>

<p>Any similarities between D&amp;D’s Kytons and Hellraiser’s Cenobites is probably not
a coincidence. Pathfinder went even further in that direction, turning its
kytons into a whole sub-category of devil with varied torture instruments
sticking out of them. So there you have chain devils, scalpel devils, and so on.</p>

<p>Kytons are present in both the Monster Manual and the Monster Vault. They’re
mostly identical aside from slight number adjustments.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Numbers-wise the 4e Kyton is a Medium Immortal Humanoid (devil), and a Level 11
Skirmisher. They have Darkvision, a speed of 7, and Resist Fire 20.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 spiked chain, and they can make two of those
with a standard action despite being regulars. This puts them damage in line
with the expected for their level even without the math fix. In fact, the
Monster Vault kyton actually does a bit <em>less</em> damage with its individual chain
attacks.</p>

<p>They can also employ these in an attack named Hellish Chains, which targets
Reflex and restrains the target on a hit (save ends). Interesting that this is
not treated as a by-the-book grapple - on one hand the target doesn’t need to
spend actions to escape, on the other “escapey” PCS can’t rely on their skills
to do so. The kyton can only have one target restrained in this way at a time.</p>

<p>When first bloodied, the devil’s Chains of Vengeance ability allows it to
immediately make two spiked chain attacks. It can also shift as a minor action
(Dance of Battle), and twice per encounter as an immediate interrupt when
attacked in melee (Dance of Defiance). That’s once at the start and once after
being first bloodied.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 11: 2 kytons, 4 legion devils (minions), 1
snaketongue celebrant, and 4 snaketonge zealots (minions). It looks like Zehir
might also be one of those deities on friendly terms with Asmodeus.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>My, the word “chain” sure gets used a lot here. Still, their looks are quite
striking. Combat-wise they seem a little better than mezzodemons at pinning down
those annoying mobile strikers, since the chain devil retains the use of all its
attacks while restraining someone and can even move away from them.</p>

<p>Bone devils, so called because they’re all thin and spiky, occupy an
intermediate rank in Hell’s hierarchy. They are fanatically loyal to their
superiors, and their main function is to keep a watchful eye on lesser devils to
make sure they’re not slacking off and are displaying the proper amount of
zeal. Their approach to dealing with slackers or cowards is notoriously violent.</p>

<p>In other words, they’re both Hell’s commissars and its middle management. I
imagine that mortal villains would summon bone devils to fulfill the same
function for their own organizations, or to help wrangle a cadre of lesser
devils. They’re also known as Osyluths, and are only present in the Monster
Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Bone Devils are Large Immortal Humanoids (devils), and Level 17 Controllers
(leaders). They’re trained in Perception, have darkvision and Resist
Fire 20. They move at speed 8, and also have a teleport speed of 8, which makes
them very mobile.</p>

<p>I’m not sure I’ve covered the Leader keyword yet. It means that this
particular monster has abilities that help its buddies in the same way a PC
leader would help other PCs. This rarely includes healing, being weighted
towards granting bonuses or extra actions. Leader monsters are most often
controllers, but other roles can be leaders too.</p>

<p>Osyluths have two auras, both with a radius of 5 squares: the Aura of Fear gives
enemies in it a -2 to attacks, and the Aura of Obedience is basically the
Commissar Signature Move. Any bloodied ally who is not also a bone devil and who
starts their turn in this aura takes 10 damage, and gains a +4 bonus to attack
and a +5 to all damage for a turn. If the damage is enough to kill the ally,
then the bone devil regains 10 HP instead.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 claw, and they also have a Reach 2 poison
stinger. This does the same damage as a claw attack, but also injects a poison
that does 10 ongoing damage and inflicts a -4 penalty to the target’s Will (save
ends both).</p>

<p>Osyluths can make a Double Attack with the claw at will, and if both claws hit
the same target it can attack them with the stinger without spending an action.</p>

<p>As a minor action the osyluth can direct its Fiendish Focus towards a
target. This has Range 5, targets Will, and gives the target a -5 penalty to all
defenses for a turn.</p>

<p>An enemy force including an osyluth is probably a bit frightening to fight. If
the bone devil really focuses on a target, the victim could be looking at a
constant -5 penalty to all defenses and a -9 to will. They pair really well with
lurkers or artillery, but are kind of a double-edged sword when paired with
melee fighters. Becoming bloodied in the vincinity of an “allied” osyluth is not
conductive to long-term survival.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 16: 1 bone devil, 5 barbazus, and 1 cambion
hellfire magus who is likely the leader of the band.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The first devil we’re looking at is actually a bad example of infernal
subtlety. Bearded devils, also known as Barbazus, are wrathful creatures who
love to fight. They tend to be used both by their hellish superiors and by
diabolist summoners as bodyguards and shock troops, jobs which suit them just
fine.</p>

<p>Bearded devils are well-armored and fight with glaives enchanted to cause
horrible bleeding wounds. Their beards are actually a mass of muscular clawed
tendrils which they can use to harass enemies. Though they have claws, they will
only use them if they somehow lose their weapons. Barbazus might be fiends but
they still have standards.</p>

<p>Like all devils, they’re Evil and speak Supernal.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Barbazus are Medium Immortal Humanoids (devils), and Level 13 Soldiers with 129
HP. They have trained Perception and darkvision, as well as 20 fire
resistance. They run at speed 6.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 2 glaive, which marks the target for a turn and
causes ongoing 5 damage (save ends) on a hit, in addition to what should be
level-appropriate damage. They also have a claw attack as described above, which
is just a normal physical attack that does less damage than the glaive and
doesn’t mark.</p>

<p>When bloodied they enter a Battle Frenzy, which gives them +2 to attacks and +5
to damage. And their Devilish Teamwork gives adjacent allies a +2 bonus to AC.</p>

<p>Oh, and there’s the beard. Its tendrils act like an Aura 1 around the devil,
dealing an automatic 5 damage to anyone who starts their turn inside.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 13, 3 barbazus and 2 yuan-ti malison sharp-eyes
(i.e., yuan-ti artillery).</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>There’s nothing extraordinary about bearded devil lore, though I find their
looks interesting. Mechanically, they seem to be solid soldiers once you fix
their damage. They use reach weapons, so they work well in two-row formations
with more of their kind, or with brutes.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>We’ve only just spend a whole lot of time looking at demons, and now we’re going
to spend a whole lot of time looking at devils. If you’re new to D&amp;D in general,
you might be wondering what’s the difference between the two types of
monster. Don’t the words “demon” and “devil” mean the same thing? Out here in
the real world they pretty much do, but D&amp;D has a long and storied tradition of
making every synonym of a word into an entirely different monster.</p>

<p>To understand what 4e devils are like, and what makes them different from
demons, I must tell you another story about the World Axis, the cosmology of D&amp;D
4th Edition. This time, it’s about the Astral Sea that exists “above” the world.</p>

<p>Just like the Elemental Chaos combined all the separate elemental planes into
one glorious mess, so does the Astral Sea combine all the former non-elemental
outer planes into a single whole. The old astral plane, which used to be a
featureless gray void, is now a literal sea, and if you look into its silvery
depths you can see the light of the stars in the world’s firmament. By sailing
the Astral Sea you can reach the domains of the gods, which work both like
islands and like worlds in themselves.</p>

<p>Now, there was this one god who had a very powerful exarch named Asmodeus. The
god was pretty nice all in all, but Asmodeus kept thinking that he was too
nice. “Why”, thought Asmodeus, “if I was the big boss here I could do a much
better job. Streamline our processes, leverage our synergies, cut away the
fat”. And so Asmodeus built himself an army out of similarly dissatisfied
servants of this god, and any other astral entity who wanted a piece of the
action.</p>

<p>You might be thinking hey, I heard this one before, and you’d be right. The
difference between the classic Lucifer story and this one, is that <em>here</em> the
rebellion was successful, since the god in question wasn’t omnipotent. He was
still powerful, however. His dying curse twisted the rebel’s bodies into forms
that exposed their inner wickedness. The rebellious angels and exarchs became
devils. The domain of the dead god twisted into itself and became the Nine
Hells. Devils don’t belong in the cosmology the way angels or even evil gods
do. Devils are <em>wrong</em>.</p>

<p>Still, devils are a lot more “human-ish” in appearance than demons. Most look
like exaggerated versions of tieflings, though technically it’s the tieflings
who look like dilluted versions of devils. Even those devils with a more
monstrous aspect still have a basically humanoid body plan, which is not a
guarantee with demons. Infernal society is militaristic and fiercely
competitive, with individual status being determined by a combination of
official rank and one’s skill at acquiring mortal souls. In other words, devils
compete for promotions by trying to impress their managers with their
outstanding productivity.</p>

<p>Anyway, that “acquiring mortal souls” bit is a big part of the reason for why
devils are <em>wrong</em>. Lots of people here in the real world say that when you’re
evil in live you go to Hell after death, but that’s not how it works in the
World Axis. Evil people who die here likely go to the realm of the evil god
whose credo more closely matches their ethics. To get souls, devils have to go
out and steal them. Each soul stolen by Hell diminishes the power of the gods,
and adds to that of the devils. The general idea seem to be that removing enough
souls from the hands of the gods will weaken then and allow devils to take over.</p>

<p>So even evil gods would have cause to oppose devils, though it turns out several
of them (Bane, Gruumsh, Tiamat, Torog and Vecna) are on more or less friendly
terms with Hell because they struck deals with Asmodeus in the distant
past. Either they believe themselves safe, or think they can outsmart Asmodeus
when it’s time for the backstabbing. What actually happens when that time comes
is left as an exercise for the GM. Asmodeus is pretty smart, but so are Vecna
and Tiamat.</p>

<p>Devils have all kinds of uses for souls, from playthings to currency to raw
material for their mightiest inventions and magics. Their methods of acquisition
are many, with the most popular ones being infernal bargains and other types of
trickery. Given all of the above I imagine they don’t necessarily try to make
you become evil, just to sign the contract.</p>

<p>However, violence is not off the table as a means of soul acquisition. This puts
a new spin on “kill them and take their stuff”. When devils fight, they do so in
a distinctly different way from demons, and their stats bear this out. Demons
are elites more often than not, and tend to fight as mobs of individuals with
their assorted sharp appendages. In contrast to this, even higher-level devils
are usually regulars, fight with well-crafted weapons, and rely a lot more on
teamwork and training.</p>

<p>Asmodeus, now a god, rules all devils from Nessus, the deepest of the Nine
Hells. Each of his exarchs rules one of the other eight layers, and while
they’re a little less popular than the demon lords, their names are still
classics: Mammon, Belial, Belzebub, and so on.</p>

<p>I’m not sure these archdevils are statted in any of the monster books; these
entries are for their less powerful underlings. We’ll see them starting next
post, using the same order I did with demons: we’ll look at the devils from the
MM, and their MV counterparts when they appear. This time it appears that all of
the devils that made it into the MV also exist on the MM.</p>

<p>All of the devils here seem to have two names. One is just an adjective followed
by the word “Devil”, the other something more exotic sounding. Since they’re
listed in the Monster Manual’s table of contents by their more prosaic names,
I’ll use those as titles, but I’ll also mention the fancier name in each
article.</p>
