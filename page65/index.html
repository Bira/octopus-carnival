            <p>I’m still working on the next post in the Dragon’s Dogma Bestiary, but I saw
something neat today and thought I had to share it and make a few comments of my
own.</p>

<p>The Hard Maths blog has an interesting article on <a href="https://hardmaths.blogspot.com.br/2017/01/grimoire-elemental-melee-spells.html">Elemental Melee Spells</a>
up. These create weapons of pure energy from nothing, and might be an
interesting addition to the arsenal of a <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/20/characters-mystic-knight.html">Mystic Knight</a>!</p>

<p>Such a character would probably value mystical power more than physical might,
as the spells don’t add to the users ST for damage and a final skill level of
15+ is vital for maintaining them for any appreciable length of time. They also
need Force Sword, a skill which would have no other use in a fantasy
setting… which means there’s a secretive order of elementalists that teaches
it along with the spells somewhere out there.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Octopus Carnival is back from is hiatus! I’ll resume my writing here with an
article that’s not directly related to any of my ongoing projects. One goes
where inspiration strikes, after all.</p>

<p>Inspiration in this case came from <a href="https://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com.br/2013/05/my-modified-df-mook-rule.html">this post</a> from Peter V. Dell’Orto over
at Dungeon Fantastic, about how the mook rules he uses on his Dungeon Fantasy
campaign. That got me thinking about the several different iteration of these
rules present both in GURPS itself and on other systems. In this article I’ll
talk a bit about those and introduce a variation on them that I’ll likely use
for my own games.</p>

<h2 id="minions-with-many-names">Minions With Many Names</h2>

<p>Mooks, Minions, Extras… by now the concept of them is probably well-known to
most roleplayers, as a bunch of RPG systems has been codifying the concept for
decades now. Since every game has a different name for this rule and I don’t
want to keep listing them all, I’ll use the name “Minions” in this article.</p>

<p>Simply put, minions are weak enemies that pose little threat to player
characters individually, and who are present in the game mostly to show case how
competent said PCs are. They have simplified statistics and usually go down with
one good hit from a PC. They take inspiration from a long line of action and
adventure movies, where it’s common for the badass protagonists to mow through a
large group of minions over the course of an action scene, or on the way to
fighting a tough, named foe. They also tend to feature heavily in chase scenes,
where their narrative purpose is to crash and burn with every maneuver the hero
pulls off to confound them.</p>

<p>The <em>concept</em> of minions has been around since the early days of D&amp;D and its
hordes of low-HD enemies pitted against mid- or high-level parties. The first
time I saw it explicitly named and codified was with Exalted and its rules for
Extras, though it almost certainly wasn’t the first system to do so. Many others
tried their hand at it, including D&amp;D 4th Edition with its Minion rules.</p>

<p>GURPS itself multiple sets of minion rules. In the core book, each minion is an
individual opponent: they always go down in one hit, and they never use Active
Defenses (but also never All-Out-Attack either). <strong>GURPS Action</strong> and <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy</strong> toughen them up a bit by allowing active defenses and allowing
for several different grades of opposition. <em>Swarms</em> are large groups of
“minions” treated like a single, abstract creature, and again we have a version
in the <strong>Basic Set</strong> and a couple more elaborate ones in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> and
other sources. I’m sure people have come up with their own variations as
well. So here’s mine! It’s focused on distinct individuals rather than on
swarms. For now, I’ll use the standard published rules for those.</p>

<h2 id="octopus-opposition">Octopus Opposition</h2>

<p>This is how I intend to grade my opposition from now on, from weakest to
strongest. The system takes inspiration from the existing GURPS rules, and also
from the several different grades of opposition presented by D&amp;D 4th Edition and
early Shadowrun (with its Professional Levels).</p>

<p>Please note that this system is most appropriate for cinematic games that follow
at least <em>some</em> “action movie” conventions regardless of their point
level. Grimly realistic games should stick to the <strong>Basic Set</strong> rules (which are
the equivalent of making all enemies Elite under this system). Campaigns that
sit somewhere in the middle could ellide the lower opposition grades and make
everyone at least a Worthy.</p>

<p>While higher-grade opposition is <em>usually</em> more skilled at fighting
than lower-grade foes, its final grade is as much a matter of narrative
importance as of pure power. In a campaign following action-movie narrative
rules, you are more likely to find higher-grade enemies the closer you are to
the story’s climax, or to your mission objective. Named NPCs are also more
likely to be of a higher grade than the troops they command even if they are
equally skilled, because the GM usually wants the NPC to stick around for a bit
longer and be memorable.</p>

<p>This also means that it’s perfectly possible for a given individual to move
between these grades depending on the circumstances of the story. That one lucky
goblin minion that managed to inflict significant damage on the party and escape
without a scratch might return as a worthy or better at a latter date if the
players become obsessed with defeating it. In the case of Horde Ninjas, this
progression could happen over the course of a single fight!</p>

<p>Belonging to a specific grade is always a “campaign feature” and as such never
costs or gives points.</p>

<h3 id="minions">Minions</h3>

<p>Minions are the equivalent of fodder in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> or <strong>Action</strong>. They
fight and defend themselves normally, but it only takes a single point of damage
getting past their DR to bring them down. This doesn’t necessarily represent
killing. A “downed” minion might be unconscious, wounded, or even actively
fleeing! Whatever happens, though, they <em>are</em> 100% out of the fight at that
point. Obviously, it’s still possible to interact with a defeated minion who is
still alive after the fight.</p>

<p>While minions can theoretically have very high skill levels and fight with fancy
techniques, they usually don’t. They tend to come in large numbers and their
tactics leverage that. This grade is appropriate for those goblin and dinoman
hordes, cheap hired thugs, or the regular forces of the evil Star Empire. Any
monster called out as fodder in official materials would be a minion under this
system.</p>

<h3 id="tough-minions">Tough Minions</h3>

<p>Also known as “purple” minions for entirely jocular reasons. They’re like
regular minions, but a little more ornery. A tough minion has an HP total like a
normal character, but always fails combat-related HT rolls. This means that any
hit that forces a “Knockdown and Stunning” roll will take them out, as will
reaching 0 HP or less. They can take a few scratches and keep going, but a solid
hit still breaks them. These are basically Petter V. Dell’Orto’s fodder
monsters, though they never recover from stunning before the fight ends. They do
recover in time afterwards, of course.</p>

<p>This grade is appropriate for pretty much the same types of foe as normal
minions in those cases where the GM wants to make things a bit more challenging,
or when the group in question has a reputation for strength but the GM doesn’t
want them to steal the scene. They’re your goblin veterans, experienced
mobsters, or those Imperial soldiers with the black armor that talk in sinister
coded radio transmissions.</p>

<h3 id="worthies">Worthies</h3>

<p>Worthies are the “standard” level of opposition. They defend themselves
normally, including making HT rolls to avoid and recover from knockdown and
stunning, but go down once they reach 0 HP or less. They’re a significant
obstacle, but you still don’t want them to stick around <em>too</em> long. The same
examples listed for Tough Minions also make suitable worthies, as does any
monster from the books not specifically listed as fodder.</p>

<p>Worthies still tend to come in groups, though these will be smaller than groups
of minions. A movie fight against five or six opponents who keep getting back up
after being hit is employing worthies instead of minions! Note that this doesn’t
mean worthies are necessarily low-skill opponents. At this level, there is no
inconsistency whathosever in making them as skilled as the PCs themselves.</p>

<h3 id="elites">Elites</h3>

<p>Elite enemies are treated just like PCs. They make full use of all of the
campaign’s combat rules. When they reach 0 HP or less, they’ll keep making HT
rolls to stay conscious and alive, and might fight to the death if they think
it’s warranted. When they don’t, retreating is always their own decision rather
than something the rules force them to do. Elites are almost always named NPCs
with their own personalities and motivations. They are rarely less skilled than
the PCs themselves, and are often better. A fight against such an opponent
usually marks an important plot milestone in adventures following movie logic.</p>

<p>Any enemy from the books who is supposed to still pose a threat when under 0 HP
is probably an Elite. Boss Monsters from <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> also fit here -
they are usually more <em>powerful</em> in terms of statistics, but they receive the
same level of plot protection as the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="special">Special</h3>

<p>Every category system needs a catch-all! Special opposition has something that
gives it even <em>more</em> narrative protection than the PCs, or that makes it not
quite fit in the ranking system above. Colossi with multiple parts that must be
destroyed in order? Multi-stage bosses that switch character sheets entirely
when defeated?  Anything goes!</p>

<p>This is the fifth post of a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to
<strong>GURPS</strong>. Previous posts can be found below:</p>

</ul>

<p>From a distance, harpies look like man-sized owls, with round heads and thick
plumage. Only when they take flight and turn on you is it possible to notice
their human-like faces and upper torsos. These features are invariably those of
women: though there are male harpies, it’s impossible to tell the difference
without dissection.</p>

<p>Harpies also have feminine voices, though they seem to be incapable of verbal
communication. In fact, they behave like large birds of prey, nesting at high
altitudes and ranging far and wide in search of prey. Harpies are full
carnivores and will attack anything that seems meaty enough to sustain them -
even people. They are an ever-present hazard in Gransys’ highlands and mountain
passes.</p>

<p>Note that these harpies are different from the those presented in <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 3: Born of Myth and Magic</strong>. You are free to use those
here as well!</p>

<p>No one has managed to tame a harpy, but those crazy enough to try are willing to
pay handsomely for unhatched eggs. Fetching those would require climbing the
steep crags where they make their nests, a challenging proposition even if one
doesn’t have to contend with a choir of enraged harpies on the way up.</p>

<p>These creatures originally came from beyond the world: ancient accounts of past
draconic invasions report armies of them arriving through the same rift as the
Dragon itself. Several stable populations remain:</p>

<h2 id="brown-harpies">Brown Harpies</h2>

<p>These inhabit the mountain chain separating South and Central Gransys, as well
as the mountains to the soutwest beyond the Shadow Fort. Their skin is an ashen
grey, covered in dark brown feathers.</p>

<p>Brown harpies have innate magical abilities: their song can compel other
creatures to sleep, an effect that becomes stronger the more voices are added to
the choir. Brown harpies live in bands (“choirs”) of 4-6 adults.</p>

<p>Brown harpies fight by using their soporific song and then grappling their
sleeping victims and dropping them from a great height. If they can’t do that
(because the target is too heavy, or resists the song), then they’ll attempt to
rake with their talons. As detailed in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 3</strong>, harpy
flyby attacks receive the -4 for Move and Attack but don’t have their skill
capped at 9, and they may retreat <em>up</em> while dodging to receive a +4 bonus.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 15; <strong>DX</strong> 13; <strong>IQ</strong> 6; <strong>HT</strong> 13</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>DR</strong> 2;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 15; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 13</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6.50; <strong>Move</strong> 3 (Ground)/13 (Air)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Soporific Song (15 vs Will)</strong>: Resisted by Will, at -1 per singing harpy
beyond the first. Affects non-harpies within 10m who hear the song. First
failure causes sluggishness (1/2 Move and Dodge) while the song lasts. Second
failure causes the target to fall asleep for 1 hour or until awoken, possibly
by being dropped from a great height by the harpy.</li>
  <li><strong>Talons (16)</strong>: 1d+3 cut. Reach C. May also <em>grapple</em> at skill 14.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (16)</strong>: 1d+2 cut.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 2; Claws (Talons); DR 3 (Tough Skin); Flight (Winged);
Peripheral Vision; Striking ST 4; Teeth (Sharp); Bestial; Fragile; Social Stigma
(Monster).</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Aerobatics-14; Brawling-16; Wrestling-14</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Faerie.</p>

<h2 id="snow-harpies">Snow Harpies</h2>

<p>These inhabit the northern highlands of Gransys, particularly the area known as
Souflayer Canyon. Their skin is black, and their feathers are snow-white with
black spots. Snow harpies possess the same soporific song as their southern
cousins, and are also endowed with a deadly frost breath attack. Use the same
stats for a brown harpy, but add Temperature Tolerance 2 for cold and the
following attack:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frost Breath (14)</strong>: Jet (range 5/10). 1d cr damage with no knockback and no
blunt trauma. Targets hit by this must roll HT with a penalty of -1 per 2
points of damage suffered or be frozen (paralyzed) for 1 minute per margin of
failure. Each snow harpy can use this only once per fight.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="succubi">Succubi</h2>

<p>While they share some similarities with harpies, succubi are demons rather than
mere magical creatures. Immortal spirits given physical form, they linger in
sites of ancient draconic invasions, or close to the Dragon itself during
them. Visually, the main difference between an harpy and a succubus is that a
succubus’ lower body and wings are those of a bat, not a bird. Their fur and
wing membranes are dark brown in color.</p>

<p>They have all the same abilities as common harpies, but their bite also carries
a deadly venom, and their touch carries a curse. Take the stats for a brown
harpy and add Immunity to Metabolic Hazards as well as an 1d toxic follow-up to
their bite. Add the following attack:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Demonic Curse (15 vs. Will)</strong>: Targets an enemy the succubus can see,
suffers from range penalties. Targets who lose the contest suffer from a
1-point Curse as per the spell on <strong>GURPS Magic</strong>, p. 129. Doesn’t work on an
already cursed target.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="silver-sirens">Silver Sirens</h2>

<p>These creatures resemble silver-colored succubi, and are actually guardian
spirits summoned by forgotten sorcery. Therefore, they can usually be found in
dungeons protecting something important. Unlike all other monsters presented in
this article, they are not only sapient but also know magic! While Silver Sirens
can fight in much the same way as harpies, they prefer to cooperate with
stronger guardian beasts, which they target with healing and support spells
while staying out of melee reach.</p>

<p>To make a Silver Siren, take the stats for a Brown Harpy and add Immunity to
Metabolic Hazards. Remove Bestial, change IQ to 12+, and add Magery 2+ along
with Healing and Body Control spells meant to buff allies. This magic requires
song, in the same manner as that of a bard.</p>

characters in this series. Ezren’s bio is <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la45?Meet-the-Iconics-Ezren">here</a>, and his stats
are <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/ezren.html">here</a>. From these we can learn the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ezren got into adventuring late in life, after wasting his youth trying to
clear his father of corruption charges that turned out to be true. He learned
his wizardry mostly by himself, as no teacher wanted an apprentice his age.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He’s the blastier sort of wizard, devoting a large portion of his spell
selection to delivering direct damage. The remainder is split between
self-buffing and non-damaging hostile spells (like <em>grease</em> and <em>obscuring
mist</em>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His preferred weapon is a cane, and at higher levels he carries plenty of
magical jewelry.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Converting Ezren into a <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> character is fairly straightforward:
he’s just a standard human Wizard. His advanced age doesn’t change anything
about his starting stats, and aging rolls aren’t a factor in a <strong>DF</strong> game. It
did give me an excuse to load him up with physical disadvantages that hint at
his frail physique while keeping his mind sharp. His spell selection is actually
pretty close to the original stats, with fire, lightning and acid attack spells,
Shield and Armor for protection, and Grease for control. He also has some nasty
area denial options in the form of Stench and Fire Cloud, as well as a bunch of
more specialized effects that fill out the prerequisites for the more powerful
stuff. His starting power item is his cane, which can be used in combat with the
Smallsword skill in emergencies.</p>

<p>Good advancement options for Ezren are mainly more Magery and spells. Keeping a
character point or two in reserve is a good way to pick up additional spells
mid-delve via Wild Talent, too! While he has a bunch of spells that require
Innate Attack, some players might find it better to replace that skill with
multiple purchases of the Psychic Guidance perk found in <strong>DF 11</strong>, p. 15.</p>
