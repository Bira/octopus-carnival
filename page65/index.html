<p>Now, this should really have been the <em>seventh</em> post in the series, as the
Martial Artist template comes before Scout. In any case, we’ll address it today,
which means our character is Sajan. Here he is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Sajan.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I think he looks kinda awesome. Anyway, his <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Sajan_Gadadvara">bio</a> and his <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/sajan.html">official stats</a>
give us the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>He was born in Vudra, his world’s India analogue, where he was a member of the
warrior caste along with his beloved twin sister Sajni. Even after they were
posted to separate barracks at the age of 12 they still met regularly to spar
and hang out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sajni was given away as part of a peace agreement, and Sajan ran after her. He
tracked her down to Absalom, his world’s “big cosmopolitan city”, and has been
looking for her since.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a monk he’s quite acrobatic and prefers to rely on his flurry of blows in
combat. He might also grapple or trip opponents with his hooked “temple
sword” if that’s more tactically advantageous.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The biggest difficulty I see in building Sajan as a DF Martial Artist is that
his Pathfinder version uses unarmed strikes a lot more often than the sword, and
those are harder to make effective in GURPS. My version of him has a bigger
focus on the temple sword, which I statted up as a khopesh from <strong>Low-Tech</strong>. As
a Weapon Master, he can cause quite a bit of damage with swings, and he’s almost
as skilled with grapples and unarmed strikes. The gauntlets help him punch armed
and armored opponents without hurting his hands. Sajan’s special skills cover
many of the abilities d20 Monks have, as well. His very limited equipment
loadout means I didn’t need to spend any character points for extra starting
cash!</p>

<p>This post is part of a series on converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy</strong>. Please go <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/06/enemies-overview.html">here</a> for links to all other posts in the
series. The first “monster family” I’m covering here is good old humanity! You
might say they’re not monsters, but you should see what they get up to from time
to time.</p>

<p>Joking aside, human opposition can be easily built using the 62- and 125-point
templates from <strong>DF 15</strong>, or the full PC templates from the other books for
leaders or particularly skilled individuals. The ready-made henchthing templates
from <strong>Mirror of the Fire Demon</strong> are also appropriate.</p>

<p>Human opponents come in several forms, with the most common discussed below. The
writeups focus on combat skills and tactics - feel free to add any other skills
and traits appropriate to the specific characters you wish to include in your
games.</p>

<h2 id="bandits">Bandits</h2>

<p>A <em>bandit</em> or <em>brigand</em> is someone who hides out in the wilderness and makes a
living robbing passing travelers. People can turn to banditry for a variety of
reasons. Some are civilians made destitute by a natural disaster and see no
other option. Some have been convicted of crimes that would see them dead anyway
if they showed their face anywhere civilized. Some, like Robin Hood’s merry men,
might use banditry as a way to undermine a ruler they oppose. And some just like
killing people and taking their stuff.</p>

<p>Bandits are never encountered alone - they always bring a few buddies to better
shank you with. While usually not very skilled as individuals, they’re clever
about picking their battles and only attack when they think they can win. Bandit
gangs range from a handful of thugs living in a small forest camp to a large and
well-organized unit in a fortified position. These hidden bases are always
relatively close to a road or settlement, which provides the gang with their
main source of targets.</p>

<p>Unless a victim looks important enough to be worth ransoming, Gransys bandits
don’t usually take prisoners. The dead tell no tales! If a potential victim
looks too tough to take on, they either leave or try to negotiate if that is not
an option.</p>

<p>The three largest bandit gangs in Gransys are the Iron Hammers, who occupy the
ruins of Aernst Castle to the south; the all-female Labrys Bandits who occupy
the ruins of Heavenspeak Castle to the northwest; and a large but nameless band
of smugglers holed up in the canyons between Windbluff and Bluemoon towers.</p>

<h3 id="bandit-strider">Bandit Strider</h3>

<p>Most bandits are archers or light skirmishers. They prefer to shoot at targets
from high ground and will only draw their swords as a last resort. They are
usually fodder, though more powerful examples exist.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 12; <strong>DX</strong> 11; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>Parry</strong> 8 (shortsword); <strong>DR</strong> 2.</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 12; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 12;</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 6.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bow (13)</strong>: 1d imp. Acc 2.</li>
  <li><strong>Cheap Shortsword (11)</strong>: 1d imp or 1d+2 cut.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Callous, Code of Honor (Pirate’s), Greed.</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Regular bow, hip quiver with 20 arrows, Medium Hardened Leather
armor, cheap shortsword.</p>

<h3 id="bandit-bouncer">Bandit Bouncer</h3>

<p>These hardier sorts prefer the personal touch. Their job is to keep the targets
too busy to get to the archers and spellcasters. They are usually worthies.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 14; <strong>DX</strong> 13; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 10 (11); <strong>Parry</strong> 10 (11) (broadsword); <strong>DR</strong> 3 (2 vs crushing).</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 14; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 12;</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 6.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cheap Thrusting Broadsword (15)</strong>: 1d+2 imp or 2d+1 cut.</li>
  <li><strong>Shield Slam (15)</strong>: 1d cr.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Combat Reflexes, High Pain Threshold, Bully, Bloodlust, Code of
Honor (Pirate’s), Greed.</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Cheap thrusting broadsword, small shield (DB 1), Jack of Plates,
leather pot-helm.</p>

<h3 id="bandit-caster">Bandit Caster</h3>

<p>The brains of the outfit, they hang back with the archers and cast debilitating
spells. They are usually worthies.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 10; <strong>DX</strong> 11; <strong>IQ</strong> 14; <strong>HT</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 8; <strong>Parry</strong> 11 (Staff).</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 10; <strong>Will</strong> 13; <strong>Per</strong> 12; <strong>FP</strong> 12;</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 5; <strong>Move</strong> 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Staff (12)</strong>: 1d+2 cr. Enchanted with the Staff spell.</li>
  <li><strong>Fireball (14)</strong>: 1d or 2d burning, costs 1 or 2 FP.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Spells</strong>: Itch-14, Spasm-14, Clumsiness-14, Hinder-14, Debility-14, Create
Fire-14, Shape Fire-14, Fireball-14, Foolishness-14, Daze-14.</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Magery 2, Psychic Guidance (fireball), Bully, Callous, Code of Honor
(Pirate’s), Greed.</p>

<h2 id="guards-and-soldiers">Guards and Soldiers</h2>

<p>These make up the rank-and-file of an organized fighting force. Most are
<em>retainers</em> in the service of a noble or wealthy merchant. They can also be
<em>mercenaries</em>, working for anyone who can pay their fee. The latter aren’t very
popular in Gransys, and are more common in other nations.</p>

<p>They’re built much like bandits, but tend to have better gear and slightly
higher combat skills.</p>

<h3 id="marksman">Marksman</h3>

<p>Marksmen use crossbows, and are trained to form firing lines and fire en
masse. In smaller battles they keep their distance and focus on high-value
targets like magicians.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 13; <strong>DX</strong> 13; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>Parry</strong> 9 (Shortsword); <strong>DR</strong> 4/2*</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 13; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 11;</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 6</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Crossbow (15)</strong>: 1d+4 imp. Acc 4.</li>
  <li><strong>Shortsword (13)</strong>: 1d+1 imp or 2d-1 cut.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 2; Night Vision 2; Duty (to lord).</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Mail Armor, Steel Pot Helm, Shorstsword, Crossbow, Quiver with 20
bolts.</p>

<h3 id="halberdier">Halberdier</h3>

<p>Trained in polearm fighting, these soldiers emply short halberds that are
equally useful on and off the battlefield.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 14; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>Dodge</strong> 10; <strong>Parry</strong> 11 (Dueling Halberd); <strong>DR</strong> 5 (torso); 4/2* (elsewhere).</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 14; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 12;</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 6.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dueling Halberd (16)</strong>: 2d+4 cut or 1d+3 imp or 2d+3 imp.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Combat Reflexes, Duty (to Lord).</p>

<p>By now we have a pretty complete picture of what the PCs in a GURPS Dragon’s
Dogma look like. They can use almost any default <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> template,
or choose to be <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/19/characters-magic-archer.html">Magic Archers</a> and <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/20/characters-mystic-knight.html">Mystic Knights</a>. They can be normal
humans, or <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/21/racial-templates.html">Pawns and Arisen</a>. They can equip themselves with
a <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/22/equipment-part-1.html">variety of gear</a> and they can use a unique form of alchemy to make that
gear <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/25/equipment-part-2.html">more powerful</a>. And we know they’ll spend quite a bit of time fighting
a variety of enemies and relieving them of their treasure. But exactly who are
these enemies? This is what we’ll examine in the next few articles!</p>

<p>The original game has a huge variety of interesting monsters to fight, and this
is something I feel a GURPS adaptation should strive to match. In true JRPG
fashion, they are divided into several “families” defined by what model they
use, and you meet more powerful members of those families as you progress in the
game. Those are a good starting point for organizing the monsters and defining
how to split them among future articles. After looking at the spoilerific
<a href="http://dragonsdogma.wikia.com/wiki/Bestiary">Bestiary</a> entry in the Dragon’s Dogma wiki and rearranging things a bit, we
come to the following list:</p>

<p>These entries are written in the order I’ll tackle each of them. The idea is to
include GURPS stats for all members of that monster family, either as full stat
blocks or as variants for a basic stat block. They will also include some
information on where the monster can be found in Gransys and what impact its
existence has in our adaptation’s setting. As articles are written for each
entry, I’ll come back to this post and add the proper links.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that these aren’t the <em>only</em> monsters that exist in the
setting, just the ones that show up on the original game. Anything could be
lurking in those dungeons! The GM is free to include additional monsters from
the DF line or other sources, or to use these in a generic DF setting.</p>

<p>Today’s template is the Scout which means’s that today’s character is
Harsk. Here he is:</p>

</figure>

<p>Just Look at all that compressed rage! His <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Harsk">bio</a> does give him plenty to be
angry about. Harsk’s official stats are <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/harsk.html">here</a>. From these we can learn the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Harsk is a Dwarf from Varisia, a “wild frontier” region that doesn’t have any
blatant ties to real-world cultures. He was a bit of an outsider to his own
stereotypically Dwarven community, and appointed himself a keeper of justice
in the wild places after his brother was killed by raiding giants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He carries his brother’s axe with him, but his preferred weapon is a heavy
crossbow he made himself. Understandably, he has giants as a favored enemy and
gains bonuses to fight them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He’s skilled in wilderness survival, particularly in mountains, and very
perceptive.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This puts us in something of a pickle. DF Scouts are excellent at shooting bows,
but Harsk’s preferred weapon is the <em>crossbow</em>. While that’s much more in line
with the dwarven idiom, it’s not supported by the standard Scout template in
<strong>DF 1</strong>. I’m still going to use that template as a base, but I’ll need to range
a bit further afield when looking for the right advantages. More specifically,
the Heroic Crossbowman advantage and the Quick Reload perk, summarized below for
ease of reference.</p>

<h3 id="heroic-crossbowman-20-points">Heroic Crossbowman (20 points)</h3>

<p>This is just like Heroic Archer, but for crossbows instead of bows. It gives the
same benefits (Acc without an Aim maneuver, eliminates Bulk penalty, halved
Fast-Draw and Quick-Shooting penalties), and also give access to perks from
<strong>GURPS Gun Fu</strong> which make sense for crossbows. This advantage wasn’t
explicitly written out anywhere that I could find, but it’s trivially derived
from Heroic Archer.</p>

<h3 id="quick-reload-1-point">Quick Reload (1 point)</h3>

<p>This perk is from <strong>GURPS Gun Fu</strong>, which details its workings for various types
of guns. The crossbow version of this perk requires Heroic Crossbowman and
allows you to reload a crossbow in one turn with a successful Fast-Draw (Arrow)
roll. You <em>can</em> use the quick-shooting rules from the description of Heroic
Archer in <strong>DF 1</strong>, p. 14 to attempt to fire your crossbow every turn!</p>

<p>With these traits in hand, statting Harsk up is fairly easy. Being a Scout, he
lacks the spells of his original version, but he scarcely needs them when he can
rely on his incredible marksdwarfship. Harsk’s increased Lifting ST from being a
Dwarf also allow him to carry a beefier crossbow, and to be one of the only
iconics so far who is at No Encumbrance while carrying his full kit.</p>

<p>Our two <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/22/equipment-part-1.html">previous</a> <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/25/equipment-part-2.html">posts</a> cover “generic” equipment and magic items
pretty well, but the original game also has plenty of distinct items with
individual names. While some of those are just part of the traditional JRPG
upgrade treadmill, others would make fine artifacts for a <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong>
game. We’ll discuss them here.</p>

<p>As described in these supplements, artifacts are magic items that don’t follow
the default rules for such in GURPS. In Gransys, their most likely origins are
Magical or Material. In either case, they can’t be further upgraded or enchanted
via alchemy, as they’re already as good as they’re going to get.</p>

<p>Any of the artifacts in <strong>DF 6</strong> and <strong>DF Treasures 2</strong> could end up making
their way into a GURPS Dragon’s Dogma game. Obviously, none of them are
available for sale anywhere, and no living artisan would know how to make one
with the possible exception of some of the consumable items in those books. But
thre <em>is</em> one other way in which a PC might come into possession of an artifact,
or even of a more normal magic item: Dragonforging.</p>

<p>Dragon blood has all sorts of magical and mythical properties in a lot of media,
and here it’s no different. A weapon or suit of armor bathed in the blood of a
dragon as that dragon is killed becomes imbued with the beast’s might! This
applies to lesser members of the dragon family as well as to The Dragon.</p>

<p>The mechanical effects of Dragonforging in GURPS “upgrade” the items worn or
wielded by a character in a manner similar to what’s possible with standard
alchemy, but much more dramatic. It <em>always</em> “maxes out” an item’s mundane
quality descriptors, making it a close to ideal example of its kind. Armor
becomes fine; shields become balanced and fine; weapons become balanced and very
fine.</p>

<p>Additionally, the items gain additional enchantments commensurate with the power
of the slain dragon. Unlike with traditional alchemy, these are <em>not</em> restricted
to what’s available for sale in shops. In fact, this is a perfect way to
introduce Artifacts to the campaign! Even artifacts found as loot are likely to
have been used by some ancient hero to slay a dragon. The most powerful among
them are those used by an ancient <em>Arisen</em> to slay <em>The</em> Dragon.</p>

<p>Obviously, it costs nothing to enhance an item in this way, other than having to
fight a dragon.</p>
