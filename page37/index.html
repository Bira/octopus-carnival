            <p>This is part of a series! Go [here][1] to see the other entries.</p>

<p>You thought getting out of the Abyss was going to be easy? Right after finishing
all nine pages of Demogorgon’s entry, it’s time to proceed to eleven more pages
of assorted demons. Each individual demon entry comes with a bit of lore and a
sample encounter group, so it’s better for me to do “Lore” and “Numbers”
subsections for each of them instead of the other way around. Since each
individual entry seems fairly simple, I’ll keep adding them to this post until I
hit my “usual” post size, and split it into subsequent parts as needed.</p>

<p>First, though, we get a small paragraph of extra Abyss lore. It says demons are
among the oldest creatures in the universe, which places the creation of the
Abyss waaaaay back at the literal dawn of time. At first there were only a few
of them: the book implies these were the original demon lords (or “demon
princes”, as written), who initially served the Chained God and had orders to
bring the universe under his heel.</p>

<p>I guess they were either the primordials caught in the “blast” that created the
Abyss, or the first ones to enter the place. Plus Dagon, who was already
there. Anyway, as the corruption of the Abyss spread, it infected other
elemental creatures and turned them into the types of “lesser” demon we know
today.</p>

<h2 id="abyssal-eviscerator">Abyssal Eviscerator</h2>

<p>These creatures made it to the Monster Vault, and I covered them <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/11/05/abyssal-eviscerator.html">here</a>. My
impression of them hasn’t changed.</p>

<h2 id="abyssal-rotfiend">Abyssal Rotfiend</h2>

<figure class="right">

</figure>

<p>An abyssal rotfiend is what you get when you take the undead spirit of an evil
creature and stuff it inside a meat puppet made of stitched-together bits of
demons and devils. The spirit is usually a demon soul, but any evil creature
will do in a pinch. With that description you’d think they’re mindless, but
they’re actually quite intelligent.</p>

<p>As undead demons, rotfiends are an Orcus specialty. Many inhabit the halls of
his fortress of Everlost, put there as a defense against teleporting
enemies. Despite their hulking appearance they rely more on damaging mind magic
than on brute force.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Rotfiends are Large Elemental Humanoids (demons) and Level 26 Controllers with
245 HP. They have Truesight, ground and fly speeds of 6, and a whole bunch of
resistances! They’re immune to fear, have Resist Fire 20, Resist Necrotic 10,
and Variable Resistance 20 (3/encounter). They are surrounded by <strong>Abyssal
Fields</strong> (aura 5) that prevent anyone inside from teleporting.</p>

<p>They’re attacks are all related to madness and body horror. The basic attack is
<strong>Skullsplitter</strong> (melee 2 vs. Reflex), which does psychic damage and is
stronger against <em>unbloodied</em> targets. <strong>Conjure Abscess</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Fortitude) also does psychic damage, and does a bit of delayed damage if the
target moves more than 2 squares in its next turn. If the rotfiend is bloodied,
that delayed damage happens when the target moves 1 or more squares.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Floating Despair</strong> (area burst 2 within 10; encounter) creates a zone
of miasma that last for a turn but can be sustained and moved with a minor
action. Anyone caught inside takes 10 psychic damage and grants combat advantage
to the rotfiend.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 24 and has a rotfiend, a glabrezu, and a
marilith. Due to the math bug its damage is low enough that I think a lot of PCs
will just take the extra hit from the abscess instead of limiting their
movement. If you fix that, though, the rotfiend becomes a better controller.</p>

<h3 id="impressions">Impressions</h3>

<p>“Ghosts clothed in dead demon flesh” is a nice, creepy concept, though I think
they lack a bit of mechanical oomph. After increasing their damage, I’d probably
tag them with the Leader keyword and make the Floating Despair zone make victims
grant combat advantage to any enemy, not just that single rotfiend.</p>

<h2 id="bebilith">Bebilith</h2>

<figure class="left">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-demon-bebilith.png"/>

</figure>

<p>Look, let’s face the truth here: Lolth is a demon lord. She’s Chaotic Evil,
lives in the Abyss, and has lineages of demons aspected to her. It’s likely the
only reason she’s classified as a “Goddess” is that she was one before in the
same way Graz’zt was a devil. And maybe due to Drow publicity campaigns.</p>

<p>Bebiliths are one of those Lolth-aspected demon lineages. They’re huge
spiderlike monsters, whose forms diverge from a spider’s only in ways that make
them scarier. Sapient but not very smart, they prowl the Demonweb Pits and other
planes eternally hunting and killing for the joy of it. Drow often use them as
heavy summoned muscle, which is the largest role their limited intellect allows
them to play in drow intrigue. They’re what your typical drow queen is going to
call up when she’s ready to start an open war.</p>

<p>Bebiliths are super-fast, have wicked claws, venomous bites, and shoot webs that
are on fire. They’re near the top of the spider-monster hierarchy, of which
Lolth is the undisputed leader.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>These are Huge Elemental Magical Beasts (demons) and Level 18 Solo Brutes with
696 HP. They have darkvision and Tremorsense 20, and are surrounded by a
<strong>Spectral Death Web</strong> (aura 3). Enemies caught inside that lose all their
resistances for a turn when they’re hit by an attack. It doesn’t have to be an
attack by the bebilith!</p>

<p>They have ridiculous ground and climb speeds of 12, obviously with Spider
Climb. They also don’t roll initiative: their <strong>Dangersense</strong> makes them act at
initiatives 20 and 10, with a full set of actions in each of these
turns. Additionally, their <strong>Hunter’s Reflexes</strong> (reaction; recharge 5-6) allow
them to shift 4 squares when someone moves adjacent to them.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Reaving Claw</strong> (melee 3 vs. AC) which does damage and
inflicts a cumulative -1 AC penalty on the target, which clears at the end of
the encounter. <strong>Flashing Claws</strong> allows bebiliths to make this attack twice in
the same action, against different targets. There’s also a <strong>Venomous Bite</strong>
(melee 1 vs. AC; recharge 6) which does more or less the same damage as a claw
plus ongoing poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>The <strong>Flaming Web</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Reflex; recharge 5-6) does fire damage,
slows, and does ongoing fire damage (save ends both). The first failed save
causes the ongoing damage to increase and worsens the “slowed” condition to
“restrained” (save still ends both).</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 20, and has a Bebilith, 3 drider shadowspinners,
and 1 drow priest. The demon is this team’s heavy, but the others can be
dangerous too, particularly against a level 15-16 party.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-1">Impressions</h3>

<p>I have “fond” memories of bebiliths because one of them featured prominently in
Hordes of the Underdark (the epic-level campaign in Neverwinter Nights). Though
they’re mostly “even giant-er” spiders, I like the mechanical “feel” on this
version. It has plenty of options.</p>

<h2 id="bloodseep-demon">Bloodseep Demon</h2>

<figure class="left">

<p>These things are covered in thin, translucid skin that constantly cracks and
weeps poisonous blood. They coat their claws in this foulness and spray it at
their victims. They’re also clever enough to use it in subtler ways, tainting
the food supplies of their intended targets in order to weaken them for the
final attack.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-2">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Bloodseep demons are Medium Elemental Humanoids (demons) and Level 7 Skirmishers
with the Leader keyword and 79 HP. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 7 and
a teleport speed of 3. Their Variable Resistance is 10 (1/encounter), and they
project a <strong>Weeping Poison</strong> aura (2) that deals 5 poison damage to enemies
caught inside. If the demon is bloodied the aura also heals any demons inside
for 5 HP at the start of their turns.</p>

<p>Their <strong>claws</strong> also do ongoing poison damage (save ends), and once per
encounter they can squeeze out a <strong>Poison Blast</strong> (close blast 5 vs. Fortitude)
which does light poison damage. Demons caught in the blast instead heal the
rolled amount of HP.</p>

<p>Their final trick is the <strong>Poison Portal Strike</strong> (recharge 4-6), which allows
them to teleport 5 squares, attack someone with a claw, and teleport another 5
squares. If used well this can cause some havoc in the party’s back line and
force some defenders to turn away from the front.</p>

<p>The sample encounter is level 7 and has one of these, 2 barlguras and 2
evistros.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-2">Impressions</h3>

<p>“Bloodseep demon” is a horrible name, but the actual monster seems a bit more
interesting than I thought at first.</p>

<h2 id="dretch">Dretch</h2>

<p>That’s about it for this post. I estimate it will take two more of about the
same size to go through all this book’s demons.</p>

    Is this guy a Martial Artist? A Swashbuckler? A Knight? Yes.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Dungeon Fantasy has the Swashbuckler template. Swashbucklers are physical
combatants who prioritize mobility and precision over heavy armor and brute
strength. They use a specialized set of weapons, are obsessed with improving
their skill, and strive to learn secret techniques of legendary reputation and
effectiveness.</p>

<p>Dungeon Fantasy also has the Martial Artist template. Martial artists are
physical combatants who prioritize mobility and precision over heavy armor and
brute strength. They use a specialized set of weapons, are obsessed with
improving their skill, and strive to learn secret techniques of legendary
reputation and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Yes, those descriptions use most of the same words. When you look at these two
professional templates from a large enough distance, they really are two takes
on the same concept. They could, in theory, be represented by the same
template. The reason Martial Artist is a separate archetype in Dungeon Fantasy
is because Monk is a separate class in D&amp;D.</p>

<p>And the reason Monk is a separate class in D&amp;D, as far as I can tell, is because
of a particular set of media cliches that have surrounded the words “martial
arts” in a lot of media contemporary with earlier editions of D&amp;D. I guess you
could call it a form of orientalism<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In some of these media sources, “martial arts” are this mysterious and exotic
secret from the mysterious and exotic East, much more sophisticated than the
crude flailings of Western barbarians. Knowing it makes you more “enlightened”
and gives you superpowers.</p>

<p>In others, they’re this fancy dance for pansies that’s totally ineffective in a
“true” fight, because a Real Man knows he just has to punch the other guy. The
Real Man in this scenario is of course always a man, and always Western too.</p>

<p>D&amp;D monks were originally based on this character named Remo Williams, the
protagonist of the Destroyer series of novels. These novels came out in the 70s,
and they were very much in the “exotic secret that gives you superpowers”
camp. Williams learned a fictional martial art from an exotic foreign master and
proceeded to use it to defeat a string of (usually Asian) bad guys. D&amp;D writers
applied a “shaolin” veneer to the class in later editions but many monk
abilities are still based on stuff Williams did in the novels.</p>

<p>GURPS replicated this in Dungeon Fantasy because it tries to replicate D&amp;D, but
its “default” approach to martial arts turns out to be a lot better in my
opinion. It has a supplement named GURPS Martial Arts that treats historical
styles from all over the world with the same level of respect. The message
contained in its rules seems to be that these styles are all different
expressions of the same thing<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. How good an individual combatant is matters a
lot more than where his techniques come from. I really liked that when I first
read it, and I’ve only grown to like it more over the years. It kinda bothers me
to see a game that still treats the subject in that older “Destroyer” way.</p>

<p>Every character who practices a fighting style and trains to improve their skill
at it is a martial artist by definition, no matter <em>where</em> that fighting style
comes from. Whether that training gives you superpowers has always been more of
a genre or campaign “setting” than something that should be assigned to
individual character types.</p>

<p>In the case of the dungeon fantasy genre, that particular setting is obviously
stuck on “yes”. Every PC can perform impossible feats of badassery, that has
been a given since the very beginning<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Someone who comes from a culture that
talks about things in terms of Chi will likely describe any such character as
possessing “strong chi”. Someone who doesn’t will just describe them as being
really good at fighting. This in no way changes the fundamentals of how their
abilities work.</p>

<p>So here’s what I’m going to do in my campaigns from now on.</p>

<h2 id="demonkified-dungeon-fantasy">Demonkified Dungeon Fantasy</h2>

<p>Chi Mastery no longer exists as a specific power. There is no Chi Talent, and
all its component abilities lose the power modifier along with the associated
discounts and drawbacks.</p>

<p>If you only have access to the DFRPG, do this instead: if a former Chi ability
is described as “working like” another trait, you can buy that trait
instead. For example, Tough Skin instead of Dragon Skin, and Striking ST instead
of Mantis Strike. For abilities that have no parallel… keep the same cost,
it’s simpler. In all cases you no longer get a bonus for Chi Talent, but you
also no longer need Disciplines of Faith: Chi Rituals to keep them either.</p>

<p>The Swashbuckler and Martial Artist become related templates. A Swashbuckler
gains access to the Martial Artist’s abilities and power-ups, and
vice-versa. Characters of each template might still look and behave very
differently on a role-playing level, but there isn’t any fundamental difference
in their mechanics any more. The 30 points that would go to Chi Talent in the
Martial Artist template are instead avaialble to be spent on any template
advantages or skills. And there you go!</p>

<p>If you’re also using <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/05/27/masterful-combat.html">Streamlined Mastery</a>, this means that a PC built using
the Martial Artist template could start off with True Master and Iron Limbs for
the same cost as the official Trained By a Master and Chi Talent 2 advantages.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-knights">What about Knights?</h3>

<p>Everything I said about monks and swashbucklers in my introduction applies
equally well to Knights and the other “fighty” templates. However, I still want
to keep it as a separate template because it’s good to still have <em>some</em>
guidance when building characters!</p>

<p>“Combatant who prefers strength and heavy gear” is different enough from
“combatant who prefers precision and speed” to remain a useful distinction. I’d
still allow some judicious cross-aisle shopping for traits that make sense for a
specific PC.</p>

<p>Heck, combining this with some form of <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/08/30/agnostic-dungeon-fantasy.html">Agnostic Dungeon Fantasy</a> (where
either no spellcaster is a priest or they all are) would leave us very close to
ditching templates entirely, or at least having a collection of “classes” that’s
much closer to that of the oldest of old D&amp;Ds: “warrior” and “magic user”. Maybe
I’ll try that some day.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-the-path">What About the Path?</h3>

<p>One of the side-boxes in the Dungeon Fantasy Companion 2 introduces the notion
of The Path, an alternate progression scheme that a Martial Artist PC can opt
into at character creation. Basically, it makes your Chi Talent levels limit how
many levels you can have in certain traits. As a result those limits are lower
to start with, but with enough time and points they can end up much higher.</p>

<p>I think The Path is more appropriate for a campaign that does the reverse of
what I’m trying to do here, where <em>everyone</em> uses chi mechanics. I’ll leave it
out of my games for now and maybe write about it at a future date.</p>

<p>This is the third and final post covering the huge Demogorgon entry in the
Monster Manual 2. As you might have guessed from what was said back in <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/06/11/demogorgon.html">part
1</a>, it covers not one but <em>two</em> multiversal big shots: the titular Demogorgon
and his buddy Dagon.</p>

<h2 id="demogorgon">Demogorgon</h2>

</figure>

<p>Demogorgon has existed in D&amp;D since at least the days of AD&amp;D 1st Edition. As I
might have mentioned his <em>name</em> got really popular due to the Stranger Things TV
show, though I understand the monster there is a different creature from the
two-headed mandrill found in the actual game.</p>

<h3 id="the-lore">The Lore</h3>

<p>Demogorgon claims the title of Prince of Demons, which is quite the bold claim
even among demon lords. His personality and motivations make him the demon
lord’s demon lord. He’s not obsessed with a specific aspect of evil, like Orcus
is with undeath. He’s not overly committed to a single modus operandi like
Graz’zt is with his sexy manipulations. He doesn’t limit his influence to a
single people like Yeenoghu does with gnolls or Baphomet with minotaurs.</p>

<p>No, Demogorgon’s goals are to become the most powerful thing in the multiverse
and destroy anyone who causes him anger or jealousy (i.e, almost everyone). His
wordly cults, as we saw, are focused on wanton destruction and have this theme
of outward madness that hides powerful mysteries. He and his agents are also
quite capable of deception and will use that to achieve their goals just as
readily. You can find servants of Demogorgon anywhere in the universe, and they
can belong to any people. His domain in the Abyss is covered in tropical jungle
but also includes seas and vast brine flats, and he is at home in all of these
environments.</p>

<p>Demogorgon’s main enemies are Orcus and Graz’zt, but though these other two are
very powerful, Demogorgon is more. The books emphasize that he has never lost a
fight - that duel with the god Amoth that nearly split him in two? He won that
one, killed Amoth, killed Storralk right after it, and then got better. Though
to Amoth’s credit, he was the only entity to ever <em>scar</em> the demon lord: he used
to only have one head before the duel, and that remained split afterwards,
healing into the current two heads.</p>

<p>Each of Demogorgon’s heads has its own name, mind and personality: Aameul is the
one that prefers deception, and Hethradiah is the one that prefers
destruction. They detest each other and their plans are frequently at odds,
which is probably the main obstacle preventing the demon lord from conquering
the universe. Still, sometimes those competing plans end up synergizing into
something that advances his goals.</p>

<p>This split nature is reflected all the way down his cult hierarchies. The layout
of his temples is split down the middle with each half dedicated to one of the
heads. The most powerful cults are led by pairs of twins, each dedicated to a
head. And as we already say even individual cultists have a “dual nature” thing
going on, starting fights as cold and calculating combatants and devolving into
frothing berserkers when they’re wounded.</p>

<p>The most powerful among his cultists might know the ritual to summon an Aspect
of Demogorgon, a living echo of his power. Like the Aspects of Orcus, they share
the personality and a fraction of the power of their originator, but their
existence is independent. An aspect doesn’t know what the original is thinking,
and vice-versa. They’re a bit like avatars from previous editions.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Demogorgon himself is a Garguantuan Elemental Humanoid and a Level 34 Solo
Controller with the Aquatic and Demon keywords. This is literally
the highest-level monster we saw so far in the entire Let’s Read - Orcus, the
former holder of the title, was level 33. His HP total is 1260.</p>

<p>He has trained Perception and Darkvision, Variable Resistance 30 switchable
3x/encounter, ground and swim speeds of 8, and a teleport speed of 10. Remember,
a teleport speed means he can teleport at will.</p>

<p>He also has the two traits previously seen on ettins. <strong>Double Actions</strong> means
he rolls initiative twice at the start of combat, once for each head, and takes
two full turns each round. His immediate actions refresh before each action. You
have to specify which turn belongs to which head, though - that head can’t use
the other’s special power. <strong>Dual Brain</strong> allows him to automatically save
against the Dazed and Stunned conditions and against any charm effects at the
end of one of his turns.</p>

<p>In combat, Demogorgon fights with his copious tentacles and with psychic powers:
the basic attack is a <strong>Tentacle Strike</strong> (Reach 5 vs. AC), but he has many more
interesting options.</p>

<p><strong>Tentacle Blast</strong> (Close Blast 5 vs. Fortitude) does almost the same damage and
deals ongoing 15 damage (save ends). If it hits a target that was already taking
ongoing damage, that damage is increased by 5. <strong>Forked Tail</strong> (Ranged 5
vs. Reflex) deals necrotic damage and weakens (save ends).</p>

<p>Those are the physical attacks; now for the magic ones!</p>

<p>Any enemy who starts their turn within 10 squares of Demogorgon is subject to
the <strong>Gaze of Abyssal Might</strong> (vs. Will; free action), which dazes until the end
of the target’s turn. He can let his enemies take a peek inside his minds with
<strong>Dual Aspects of Demogorgon</strong> (close blast 10 vs. Will; recharge 6) which deals
heavy psychic damage and knocks the targets unconscious (save ends) on a
hit. That’s a potential TPK right there.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, each head has a special power that can be used in its
assigned turn. These are minor actions, so they’ll happen alongside one of the
other attacks. They’re both Close Blast 5 vs. Will. <strong>Aameul’s Gaze</strong> does
psychic damage and dazes (save ends). If the target was already dazed, for
example by the Gaze of Abyssal Might, they are dominated instead (save
ends). <strong>Hethradiah’s Gaze</strong> does a bit less psychic damage but forces the
target to use an <em>at-will attack power</em> against a target of Demogorgon’s choice.</p>

<p>Running away from all this is also quite hard: <strong>Inescapable Grasp</strong> is a Ranged
<em>50</em> power that targets Will and teleports the target to a square within
tentacle reach of Demogorgon.</p>

<p>We also get a stat block for the Aspect of Demogorgon, which is very similar but
smaller in all ways. It’s “only” Huge, and a Level 25 Elite Controller with 476
HP. It uses Forked Tail as its basic attack and replaces the named gazes with a
<strong>Dominating Glare</strong> that deals psychic damage and dominates. It has all the
other attacks, including the Double Actions and Dual Brain traits.</p>

<p>Dagon is inspired by the Lovecraftian entity of the same name, but is not quite
the same creature. He’s been in the game since the days of AD&amp;D.</p>

<h3 id="the-lore-1">The Lore</h3>

<p>The first primordials who entered the Abyss shortly after it had formed found
Dagon already lurking in its depths. He is the first and most ancient Demon
Lord. His presence poses a disturbing question: did Tharizdun create the Abyss,
or merely open a passage to it?</p>

<p>(I think this gets answered in the Demonomicon, but it’s still cool even if left
as a mystery).</p>

<p>Dagon is remarkably secretive for a demon lord, and he sits on an endless trove
of blasphemous knowledge and terrible cosmic secrets. He allied himself with
Demogorgon shortly after the latter became a demon lord, and the two have
cooperated ever since. Their cults often work together, and though Dagon’s
cultists are a minority in these joint efforts, access to their master’s
knowledge makes them very effective leaders.</p>

<p>Dagon shares some of his knowledge with Demogorgon to further both of their
goals, but ever since the the “split” he has taken to whispering different bits
of lore to each head, which ends up making Aameul and Hethradiah antagonize each
other even more.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Dagon is a Gargantuan Elemental Magical Beast with the Aquatic and Demon
keywords, and a Level 32 Solo Soldier with 1184 HP. He has the usual Darkvision
and Variable Resistance (10, 3x/encounter). His ground speed is only 4, which
doesn’t matter because you’re definitely fighting him underwater. He also has
swim and teleport speeds of 8. Dagon also has an <strong>Eye of the Abyss</strong> aura (10)
that pulls any enemies who start their turns inside 5 squares.</p>

<p>Dagon might begin the fight at range, using his control over <strong>Abyssal Tides</strong>
to attack the PCs. This is an Area Burst 3 within 20 vs. Reflex, doing force
damage and immobilizing the targets on a hit (save ends). As an effect, Dagon
can also teleport 5 squares.</p>

<p>Once the PCs are in reach, it’s Tentacle Town. Dagon can uses his tentacles
either for a basic <strong>Tentacle Strike</strong> (Reach 5 vs. AC) or a <strong>Tentacle Blast</strong>
(Close Blast 5 vs. AC), both of which damage and slide the targets 2 squares on
a hit. They also act on their own with <strong>Grasping Tentacles</strong> (Reach 5 vs. AC),
an interrupt that triggers when an enemy in reach attacks Dagon. This does a
little less damage than the basic attack and grabs the target. The escape DC is
something like 44 or 46 depending on the skill you use, which will be tricky for
a non-specialist even if they’re level 30. And of course these Reach 5 tentacles
have <strong>Threatening Reach</strong> as well.</p>

<p>It’s not all tentacles either! Dagon’s repertoire includes a hefty dose of pure
madness. <strong>Doom Drone</strong> (close burst 10 vs. Will; minor action; recharge 5-6)
targets enemies and does psychic damage. It also pulls them 5 squares and stuns
them on a hit (save ends). <strong>Form of Madness</strong> is similar but slides and dazes
instead of pulling and stunning. If several enemies manage to get in close
Dagon can use <strong>Claws of the Abyss</strong> (close burst 1 vs. Reflex) to deal heavy
physical damage with his non-tentacle appendages. Note he can use the claws
<em>and</em> both mental attacks in a turn.</p>

<p>The tactics paragraph makes a reference to a power named <strong>Wrath of the Deep</strong>,
though that’s not in the stat block. One of them is wrong. In either case
Dagon’s goal should be to keep all the PCs, particularly the squishies, well
inside the tentacled killing zone surrounding him.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Of the big bosses, only Demogorgon features in a sample encounter here: Level
35, him and two balors.</p>

<p>These two make nice final bosses for an epic campaign, though probably not at
the same time. Demogorgon’s Dual Brain gives him a decent amount of control
resistance. Dagon is a bit less strong in that area, but both of them can output
an incredible amount of control themselves.</p>

<p>I imagine that a campaign that ends with the defeat of Demogorgon is one where
Dagon never shows up in person at all - he’d be too clever to stick around in
that case. The reverse is harder to predict. Demogorgon values the alliance but
is probably too selfish to try and help Dagon if a party of epic demigods knocks
at his briny door. He might however, try to exact revenge on them later, so he
could end up being the “final final” boss in a Dagon-focused campaign. Or
perhaps he does things on a long enough timescale that he ends up being the boss
of the <em>next</em> campaign.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Continuing from the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/06/11/demogorgon.html">previous post</a>, this time we’ll be looking at Demogorgon’s
Exarchs.</p>

<p>“Exarch” is the term D&amp;D 4 uses for the “lieutenants” of a god or equivalent
entity. They might preside over a narrower slice of their master’s portfolio, or
simply help run their operations in the world and other planes. Though
subordinate to someone else, exarchs are in no way weak: in the god-ranking
system used in previous editions, all of them would have ranked as anything from
demigods to intermediate deities themselves.</p>

<p>Orcus, which we looked at in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/26/ettin.html">Monster Manual let’s Read</a>, had one exarch:
Dorensain, the King of Ghouls. Demogorgon has two, described below.</p>

<h2 id="kazuul">Kazuul</h2>

<p>Kazuul used to be a human champion of Erathis a long time ago, and in her
service he carved many a swath of order through savage lands. I guess that in
the end something convinced him that this “carving a swath” business didn’t make
him any different from the “savages” he claimed to oppose, and so he decided to
embrace that and pledge himself to Demogorgon.</p>

<p>The demon lord gave him a gift of size and strength, making him double in size
and become deformed by his over-developed demonic musculature. Kazuul now fights
in the name of Hethradiah, the “brutal but cunning” head, driving a horde of
demons before him to raid places in the Abyss and elsewhere in the multiverse. I
guess Kazuul is a big inspiration to those shrieking cultists we saw in the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/06/11/demogorgon.html">last post</a>.</p>

<p>Being a former human, Kazuul fights with weapons. Being a former <em>adventurer</em>,
he’s always on the lookout for better weapons. If he notices one of his
opponents is wielding something particularly sweet (say, a level 28+ magical
weapon), he will engage that opponent and ignore everyone else until he’s taken
the weapon for himself. Otherwise, he will just focus on killing whoever is
closest and repeating that until there is no one else to kill.</p>

<p>This obsession with magic weapons stems in part from the fact that Kazuul used
to own a legendary sword named Gorgorin the Shatterer. He lost it in a battle
against Hainard, one of Pelor’s exarchs. He’s still sore about that, and looking
for a way to either get his sword back or to find a suitably awesome
replacement.</p>

<p>Kazuul’s current weapons are quite awesome already: there’s The Tooth of Grom, a
sword forged from the tooth of a fire titan lord, and The World Splitter, an axe
taken from Clangeddin Silverbeard, one of Moradin’s Exarchs.</p>

<p>There’s an ancient prophecy which proclaims that when Kazuul recovers Gorgorin,
he will use it to slay Demogorgon and then displace Yeenoghu as the lord of
gnolls. This prophecy has caused lots of infighting amongst demons, and there
have been several failed attempts by all factions involved to find the blade’s
current hiding place.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Kazuul is a Large Elemental Humanoid with the Demon tag, making him an official
demon. He’s a Level 28 Elite Soldier with 528 HP. He has Darkvision and demonic
Variable Resistance 10, switchable 3x/encounter. He has ground and fly speeds of
5.</p>

<p>He has two basic attacks with his sweet magic weapons: the <strong>Tooth of Grom</strong>
(Reach 2 vs. AC) does physical damage and forces the target to make a melee
basic attack against a target of Kazuul’s choice on a hit; the <strong>World
Splitter</strong> (reach 2 vs. AC) also does physical damage and inflicts a -4 AC
penalty (save ends). <strong>Wrath of Kazuul</strong> allows him to attack with both weapons
in a single standard action. Oh, and <strong>Threatening Reach</strong> allows him to make
opportunity attacks against any enemy he can reach.</p>

<p>If his enemies are beyond the reach of his blades, Kazuul can attack with
<strong>Abyssal Flames</strong> (area burst 3 within 20 vs. Reflex) at will, doing fire
damage on a hit. He also has a couple of handy spells for use when he gets
closer:</p>

<p><strong>Word of Doom</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Will; encounter) does heavy physical damage
and allows Kazuul to crit against the targets on a natural roll of 15-20 (save
ends). This is scarier than it might sound for someone used to 3.x! In Fourth
Edition, criticals happen only on a natural 20. Only a handful of powers in the
entire game increase that range. Word of Doom is the only one I can think of
that widens it this much.</p>

<p><strong>Vortex of Blades</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Reflex; enemies only; encounter) does
double the damage of a basic attack and stuns (save ends). Simple, but still
scary: stun (save ends) is a pretty serious condition.</p>

<h2 id="thrarak">Thrarak</h2>

<figure class="right">

</figure>

<p>Thrarak’s origins are closely tied to the mythological origns for <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/26/ettin.html">ettins</a>
that I wrote about during the first Monster Manual/Vault Let’s Read. It starts
with Demogorgon fighting the god Amoth, who split his head in two. Before that
wound had even healed, the earth primordial Storralk ambushed him and tried to
take him down.</p>

<p>As the linked post says, Demogorgon defeated the would-be usurper handily, and
bound his broken but still-living form under his throne. It was Dagon who gave
him the idea for a bit of extra cruel punishment: using a ritual provided by
Dagon, Demogorgon caused the first Ettins to be born from Storralk’s spilled
blood, and to scatter through the world. Each one contains a small fraction of
Storralk’s essence, so whenever an ettin feels pain, Storralk’s body feels it as
well.</p>

<p>One of those first ettins chose to stay at Demogorgon’s side, and to seek his
favor by alternatively healing and cutting Storralk’s flesh. This eventually got
his attention and Demogorgon made her one of his exarchs: Thrarak, the Flayed
Maiden.</p>

<p>Thrarak is specifically the Exarch of Ameul, the cunning head. She acts as
Demogorgon’s emissary of vengeance, going after mortals and other entities that
have angered the Prince of Demons or those who have the potential to become
threats in the future. An expert torturer, she fights using twin lashes and
yelling streams of maddening lore that’s dangerous to hear. She prefers to focus
on one opponent at a time, which will either be the target of her master’s ire
or the closest available enemy. Once she chooses a target she will ignore any
other enemies to focus on it.</p>

<p>Legend has it that if Thrarak is slain and her heart burned upon Demogorgon’s
throne, Storralk will finally break free of his prison. Freeing him could be an
important step in defeating Demogorgon himself.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Thrarak is a Large Elemental Humanoid (giant) and a Level 26 Elite Brute with
596 HP. She has all the traits common to all Ettins: trained Perception,
darkvision, ground speed 8, and the Dual Brain and Double Actions traits
described in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/02/26/ettin.html">original ettin post</a>.</p>

<p>Her basic melee attack is the <strong>Lash of Ruin</strong> (Reach 3 vs. AC) which does
physical damage, knocks prone, and dazes for a turn on a hit. She can sometimes
increase her rythm and perform a <strong>Lashing Flurry</strong> maneuver (close burst 3
vs. AC; recharge 5-6), dealing physical damage and dazing (save ends) all she
hits.</p>

<p>Once per encounter she can perform a <strong>Howl of Madness</strong> (Close Blast 5
vs. Will), which does psychic damage, slides the targets 3 squares, and forces
them to make a melee basic attack against a target of Thrarak’s choice.</p>

<p>Those ettin traits I linked to are quite important to all of this: Thrarak has
two full turns per round and some resistance to restrictive conditions. She can
do a lot, which makes her dangerous to those enemies she’s focusing on. She
should be put in charge of a monster team who can keep the remaining PCs off her
back.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have one encounter for each Exarch:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 25: Thrarak, 1 abyssal rotfiend, and 2 nycademons.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 27: Kazuul, 1 marilith, and 1 balor.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It feels appropriate to add a whole bunch of minions to either encounter, if you
think they’re not dangerous enough.</p>

<p>I think I like these two as villains more than I like Dorensain, Orcus’
exarch. Mechanically, Thrarak is just an epic ettin, but she has an interesting
backstory tied to her people’s mythological origins. Kazuul’s magic weapon
obsession is also interesting, and the Gorgorin lore has a lot of potential as
an adventure hook.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/06/12/popcorn-initiative.html">Popcorn Initiative in GURPS</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <figure class="center">

</figure>

<p>GURPS uses a fairly traditional initiative system to determine who goes first in
combat. Like all such systems, it works well for “real-time” gaming, but it
tends to get in the way of good “flow” for a Play-by-Post or other asynchronous
game.</p>

<p>In the past I tried to solve that by having players declare 3-5 turns’ worth of
actions in advance and resolving those on my side, but that ended up being a lot
of work and after a while I burned out on it.</p>

<p>It was at about this time that I first read Lancer, and noticed it used an
interesting initiative system. One of the PCs always acts first in a turn,
followed by an enemy. We alternate that way until all people on one side have
acted, and then the remaining combatants on the other side act one after the
other. The players themselves decide who acts during each “player activation”,
and the GM decides who acts during each enemy activation. The order in which
characters act can therefore vary from turn to turn, but the order of
<em>activations</em> always remains the same.</p>

<p>I’d later find out this model was known as “Popcorn Initiative”. It worked well
for me in the couple of sessions of real-time Lancer I ran, and I’d get a lot
more experience with it when I joined a forum game of Zeitgeist using D&amp;D 4th
Edition rules.</p>

<p>Popcorn Initiative works extremely well in that game. Post flow during combat is
pretty much uninterrupted as long as there’s anyone available to post. We get
through a whole combat round in a single day if everyone is on point, a
formidable pace for an asynchronous game.</p>

<p>It worked so well, it made me think I’d only run an async GURPS game if I could
use popcorn initiative in it. And it turns out adding popcorn initiative to
GURPS is not hard at all!</p>

<h2 id="the-rule">The Rule</h2>

<p>Instead of using Basic Speed values to determine turn order, use the system
described at the start of this post, and repeated here for ease of reference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A PC always goes first, followed by an enemy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The two sides then alternate taking their turns until all members of one side
have finished.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining combatants then take their turns one after the other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat the above procedure for each 1-second round in the combat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Players decide which PC acts on each player turn. The GM decides who acts on
each enemy turn. The order doesn’t have to remain constant from second to
second.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Traits and maneuvers that give extra actions or extra attacks all affect the
character’s <em>own</em> turn, as normal. A character’s defenses “reset” at the start
of their turn as usual. Surprise still works the same, and limits your actions
in the same way. All this rule change is how to determine the order in which
turns happen in a 1-second round.</p>

<p>If the battle involves one or more characters with Enhanced Time Sense, then
all of them get to go before the less enhanced combatants, using the rules above
among themselves. It effectively splits the second into two “sub-rounds”.</p>

<p>Having a high Speed here is still useful because it gives you more Dodge and
more Move. Changes to Basic Speed cost the same as under the standard rules.</p>

<h2 id="popcorn-examples">Popcorn Examples</h2>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: A party of four fantasy adventurers fights a group of 6 orcs. The
heavily armored warrior PC goes first and positions himself to protect his
squishier buddies. An orc goes next, then a PC, and so on until all PCs have
acted. The final two orcs act one after the other.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: Two of the orcs in the battle above attack the warrior, who
blocks once and parries once. This leaves him with penalties for further
defenses. If he is not the first to act next round, the penalties will stay with
him until he does take his turn.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong>: The same four adventurers meet a Giant Enemy Crab who has Extra
Attack 1. Again one of the PCs goes first. The crab goes next, and he can make 2
attacks during his turn as in the normal rules. Then the remaining PCs act.</p>

<p><strong>Example 4</strong>: A group of 6 WW2 British Commandos ambushes a patrol squad of 8
Nazi soldiers. The Nazis are surprised and are considered Mentally Stunned as
per the standard rules. Though the GM gets to choose the order in which the
enemy soldiers act, all they can do on their turns is attempt to recover from
the stun.</p>

<p><strong>Example 5</strong>: A 6-person squad of the Solar Patrol runs into a pack of three
homicidal robots while exploring a ghost spaceship! All of the robots have
Enhanced Time Sense, and so does one of the PCs who is a robot themselves. So
the PC robot acts first, then the three enemy robots, and then the rest of the
PCs.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is definitely a system I want to try out when I next GM an async GURPS
game. I tried to change the standard rules as little as possible. Lancer does a
few more things, like giving certain powerful enemies multiple activations per
round, but I want to experiment with this base version before I try doing that
in GURPS.</p>
