<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>This is it, the one you’ve been waiting for. The most hyped variant of the most
hyped monster in the entire game. Red dragons have made it to the cover of the
core books in multiple editions, and they’re the ones you think about when you
read the words “lays waste to the countryside”.</p>

<p>Part of this increased mystique comes from the fact that D&amp;D red dragons breathe
fire, which means they get to take a ride on every classical myth or fantasy
novel that features fire-breathing dragons. Personality wise, the book describes
them as doubling up on greed. Red dragons pursue treasure much more vigorously
than their weaker kin, which ironically means they’re much harder to buy off
with tribute. Why wait for you to give them your money a little at a time when
they can just raid you and take it all at once? Their preference for mountain or
volcanic lairs means a large enough red in search of a new lair might just be
strong enough to clear out a dwarf kingdom and make its lair in the treasure
vault.</p>

<p>The fiery breath of an older red dragon has an additional trick in this edition:
it can strip the fire resistance of those it hits. This means they’re equipped
to pull the Dark Schneider Maneuver and kill something like an efreet or fire
archon with fire. Or your party’s fire sorcerer.</p>

<p>Red Dragons fill the Soldier role, which means they fight up close and are smart
about it. We’ll look at them by book.</p>

<h2 id="red-dragon-monster-manual">Red Dragon (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>MM Red Dragons have trained Bluff, Insight, Intimidade and Perception. Like all
dragons they have Darkvision and an age-dependent amount of resistance to their
signature element (fire). They move fairly fast on land and fly well enough to
hover.</p>

<p>At all ages their basic attack is a bite that does physical and fire
damage. They can instead perform two claw attacks if they want. As a reaction,
they can use a Tail Strike against an enemy that moves to flank them. This
targets Reflex and on a hit does some damage and pushes the target 1 square.</p>

<p>The famous fire breath is a Close Blast 5 that targets Reflex and does a bundle
of fire damage, half on a miss. It recharhes on a 5-6. Bloodied Breath and
Frightful Presence round out the universal red dragon kit.</p>

<p>Young reds are Large Level 7 Solo Soldiers with 332 HP and fire
resistance 15. Their land speed is 6, their flight speed 8 (hover) with Overland
Flight 12, and their melee reach 2.</p>

<p>Adult reds are Large Level 15 Solo Soldiers with 750 HP and fire
resistance 20. Their numbers are bigger, but they otherwise have the same set of
abilities as the young dragon.</p>

<p>Elder Reds are Huge Level 22 Solo Soldiers with 1050 HP, Fire Resistance 25, and
melee Reach 3. Their land speed is 8 and their flight speed 10 (hover). To the
standard suite of abilities they add Immolate Foe, a Ranged 20 attack that does
slightly less damage than the breath weapon plus ongoing 10 fire damage. It
targets Reflex and recharges on a 5-6.</p>

<p>An Ancient Red Dragon is a Gargantuan Level 30 Solo Soldier with 1390 HP, Fire
Resistance 40 and Melee Reach 4. This puts it on par with the Tarrasque, and
makes it a good case for this being <em>the</em> Ancient Red Dragon.</p>

<p>In addition to everything the elder can do, the Ancient has an Inferno aura that
extends to 5 squares and does 20 fire damage to anything that enters it or
starts its turn there. It also gives everyone inside (including the dragon)
concealment against ranged attacks. Its breath weapon gains a secondary attack
against Fortitude on a hit, and if <em>that</em> hits it strips all fire resistance
from the target until the end of the encounter. This had been hinted at in the
lore, but I honestly thought it would kick in earlier in the dragon’s life
cycle.</p>

<h2 id="red-dragon-monster-vault">Red Dragon (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>MV Red Dragons have the same senses and movement as their MM counterparts,
though they lose training in Intimidate for some reason. As usual for MV
dragons, they lose Frightful Presence, retain Bloodied Breath, and gain Action
Recovery and an instinctive action. In this case it’s Instinctive Assault, which
allows them to bite once or claw twice at 10+rolled initiative.</p>

<p>The basic bite attack got powered up - on a hit it does physical damage and
grabs the target with an age-dependent escape DC. Until the grab ends, the
target takes ongoing fire damage (which increases if the dragon is bloodied).</p>

<p>The claw attack <em>also</em> grabs the target on a hit, with a slightly easier escape
DC. I think the dragon can have up to three grabbed victims - one from the bite
and two from the claws. This can be useful to split the party up.</p>

<p>The breath weapon works the same: fire damage on a close blast 5, half on a
miss. Tail Strike remains, with a reach 1 greater than the dragon’s basic reach.</p>

<p>The Young Red Dragon is a Large Level 7 Solo Soldier with 332 HP and fire
resistance 15. Its melee reach is 2 (3 for the tail strike). Its breath weapon
does additional damage if the dragon is bloodied.</p>

<p>The Elder Red Dragon is a Huge Level 22 Solo Soldier with 832 HP and fire
resistance 20. Its land speed is 8, with flight 10. Its melee reach is 3 (4 for
the tail). In addition to all of the young red’s abilities, the elder can use
Immolate Foe, which works much like its MM counterpart.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The MM has two, both fairly beefy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: 1 adult red dragon, and a trio of githyanki. Yes, for some reason
red dragons and githyanki get along well. I guess they have a lot in common,
since they’re both grasping conquerors and all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 24: 1 elder red dragon, 2 fire archon ash disciples, and 2 fire
giants. Burn, baby burn! I would probably rewrite the ash disciple stats
though.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Ironically, despite being the strongest and most famous of dragons, reds are
somewhat lacking in interesting powers compared to the other chromatics. Their
breath is straight damage, and their instinctive action doesn’t grant
movement. The ability to strip fire resistance is pretty awesome, but only the
MM Ancient has it. If I brought it back I’d at least also give it to the Elder.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault version is better at expressing the monster’s Soldier
role. Their grabby attacks allow them to split the party up, and maybe
carry a PC or two off if they can’t escape in time.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Blue dragons are proud, vain, and like lording over lesser creatures in their
domain. Unlike greens, they don’t feel the need to stoop to sleazy extortion
schemes - they’ll personally land in the middle of your village and announce
they’re your new ruler. This, ironically, makes blues one of the more
<em>reasonable</em> dragon types, because they’ll take this ruler business seriously if
you keep their egos well-inflated.</p>

<p>Their breath weapon is lightning. Previous editions had them prefer deserts, but
4th Edition says their preferred environments are coastal regions and seaside
caves. It makes sense, as thunderstorms are closely associated with the sea and
blue isn’t exactly the best color for desert camouflage.</p>

<p>Aside from any people they might claim as subjects, blue dragons are known to
associate with other coastal or sea monsters, like sahuagin or storm
giants. However, they are not themselves aquatic, so their domains likely don’t
extend to the depths unless those sahuagin are really enthusiastic about serving
the dragon. As usual, they’re Natural Magical Beasts with the Dragon keyword.</p>

<h2 id="blue-dragon-monster-manual">Blue Dragon (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>MM Blue Dragons are all Artillery. They have Darkvision, and trained Perception,
Athletics, Insight and Nature.  They also have an age-dependent amount of
lightning resistance. They move on land and fly well enough to hover.</p>

<p>That honking big horn in the illustration means their basic attack is not a bite
but a Gore, which does a mix of physical and lightning damage. Their claws also
count as a basic attack, and they can use Draconic Fury as an action to make one
gore and two claw attacks.</p>

<p>Those melee attacks aren’t the real stars of the show, though. The Breath Weapon
is a bolt of lightning that targets 1 creature up to 10 squares away, jumps to
another one up to 10 squares away from the first, and then jumps again to a
third target up to 10 squares away from the second. Despite looking like a
ranged attack, it does not provoke opportunity attacks. It targets Reflex, does
lightning damage (half on a miss), and recharges on a 5-6.</p>

<p>The dragon can also spit a Lightning Burst at will. This is an Area 2 within 20
attack that targets Reflex and does a bit less lightning damage than the breath
weapon (half on a miss). Finally, we have Frightful Presence as an encounter
power and Bloodied Breath as a triggered action.</p>

<p>Young Blue Dragons are Large Level 6 Solo Artillery with 296 HP. Their lightning
resistance is 15, their land speed 8 and their flight speed 10 (overland flight
15). Their melee Reach is 2.</p>

<p>Adult Blue Dragons are Large Level 13 Solo Artillery with 655 HP and Lightning
Resistance 20. They are otherwise identical aside from icreased level-based
stats (accuracy, damage, defenses).</p>

<p>Elder Blues are Huge Level 20 Solo Artillery with 960 HP and Lightning
Resistance 25. Their land speed goes up to 10 and their flight speed to 12. To
all the powers listed above they add Thunderclap, an at-will Close Burst 3 that
targets Fortitude. On a hit it does thunder (AKA sonic) damage and stuns for a
turn. On a <em>critical</em> hit, the stun becomes (save ends). So these <em>do</em> have a
reason to land: to claw and gore a stunned victim. Its melee reach is 3.</p>

<p>Ancient Blues are Gargantuan Level 28 Solo Artillery with 1290 HP and Lightning
Resistance 30. To the elder’s abilities they add Wingclap, a <em>move</em> action that
recharges on 5-6 and allows the dragon to fly its speed and make a melee attack
with its wings that targets Fortitude and does thunder damage. This doesn’t
provoke opportunity attacks! Its melee reach is 4.</p>

<h2 id="blue-dragons-mv">Blue Dragons (MV)</h2>

<p>Monster Vault Blue Dragons have the same senses as their MV counterparts,
dropping Overland Flight as usual. Their bite does pure lightning damage, with
fixed math. The claw is no longer a basic attack, but they can still claw
twice.</p>

<p>The wording on the lightning breath has been vastly simplified: it’s a Close
Blast 10 that targets up to three creatures in the blast. This means the dragon
can’t use it on someone 30 squares away any more, and that Lightning Burst is
now its longest-ranged attack.</p>

<p>As usual for MV dragons, they lose Frightful Presence but retain Bloodied
Breath. Blues also have Wing Backblast, which triggers whenever someone hits
them with a melee attack and represents the dragon suddenly taking off. It’s a
Close Burst 2 that targets Fortitude and knocks prone with no damage on a
hit. Hit or miss, the dragon flies half its speed straight up.</p>

<p>For passive traits, they have Action Recovery and Uncontained Lightning, an Aura
5 that activates when the dragon is bloodied and causes 5 lightning damage to
anyone who enters or starts its turn inside. The instinctive action allows them
to fly their speed without provoking opportunity attacks and use Lightning Burst
at any point in the movement.</p>

<p>The Young Blue Dragon is Large Level 6 Solo Artillery with 296 HP and all the
abilities outlined above. Its resistance is 10 and its melee reach 2.</p>

<p>The Elder Blue is Huge Level 20 Solo Artillery with 756 HP, resistance 15 and
melee Reach 3. To the youngun’s abilities it adds Thunderclap. This has the same
name as the MM ability but it’s pretty different! This is an Area 3 within 20
attack. It targets Fortitude and on a hit does thunder damage and stuns for a
turn. On a miss, it does half damage and dazes for a turn. The area of the
elder’s breath weapon increases to 20 as well.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>There are two sample encounters in the MM:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13, an adult blue dragon and 3 dragonborn raiders. Pirates! Arrrr!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 24, an elder blue dragon and 2 thunderwaks (which are like Rocs, but
lightning-infused). Just taking the pets out for a leisurely flight along the
coast.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Neither book’s blue dragons have reason to land when fighting PCs. Lightning
Burst allows them to outrange everything except the ranger’s arrows and the
wizard’s Magic Missiles. The MV variant can actually keep itself even further
away and use its instinctive actions to swoop into range, fire off a burst, and
move away again. A blue dragon who wants to play it safe can force the party
into a very boring extreme-range artillery battle.</p>

<p>Fortunately, very few blue dragons would want to play it safe - they should be
closing in to use their more powerful breath weapon, and should land to gore and
claw anyone they manage to stun. If that seems like a bad bet even for these
vain pirate kings, you should provide them with some lightning-resistant
henchthings who will engage and hold the party in position for a
bombardment. This should give your melee fighters something to do as well.</p>

<p>You can still play the “long range artillery battle” angle as a run up to the
final battle with the dragon - the approach to its lair should have a layout
that allows the dragon to bombard the PCs while they deal with the enemies and
traps guarding it. Periodic Lightning Burst attacks become another hazard they
have to contend with as the blue dragon taunts them from afar.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Green dragons are sly manipulators, which makes me think that the first sign
you’ll get that one has decided to lair near your village is when it invites you
to negotiate its tribute. They like dense forests and places with connections to
the Feywild.</p>

<p>They’re excellent fliers and quite agile in the ground as well. Their breath
weapon is a cloud of poisonous gas. Some sources describe that as chlorine, but
that would be more caustic than poisonous.</p>

<p>Aside from the usual kobold riffraff, their preferred allies and minions are fey
creatures. They can also travel in pairs or even in packs. Don’t believe it when
a green dragon says it’s alone.</p>

<p>Like all dragons, they’re Natural Magical Beasts with the Dragon keyword. We’ll
look at them book-by-book.</p>

<h2 id="green-dragon-monster-manual">Green Dragon (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The MM green dragons have darkvision, plus training in a wide variety of skills:
Bluff, Diplomacy, Insight, Intimidate and Perception. They also have an
age-dependent amount of poison resistance. They’re fast runners and even faster
fliers.</p>

<p>In all age categories it has two basic attacks: a bite that does physical damage
plus ongoing poison damage, and a weak claw that can attack twice as a standard
action. It can also perform flyby attacks, flying up to its speed and biting at
any point along its movement without provoking opportunity attacks. This
recharges on a 5-6.</p>

<p>The Breath Weapon is a Recharge 5-6, Close Blast 5 poison cloud that targets
Fortitude, does immediate and ongoing poison damage, and slows (save ends
both). There’s also a slow aftereffect, meaning that you need to pass two saves
to stop being slowed. I guess that poison is some sort of nerve gas! Unusually,
the breath weapon doesn’t do anything on a miss, so it must decay fast.</p>

<p>Aside from the familiar Frightful Presence, the green dragon can also use a
Luring Glare, a minor-action charm power that targets Will and slides the target
2 squares. It uses this to pull people into its breath weapon’s area of effect.</p>

<p>For triggered actions, it has Bloodied Breath and a Tail Sweep that targets
adjacent enemies that don’t move in their turns. It targets Reflex, does some
damage, and knocks prone on a hit.</p>

<p>These dragons don’t have a reason to land as long as they have one of Breath
Weapon or Flyby Attack available. With enough luck on the dice they can stay up
there quite a while, and will take off again as soon as they can.</p>

<p>Young Green Dragons are Large. They’re Level 5 Solo Skirmishers with 260 HP,
Poison Resistance 15, a land speed of 8, and a fly speed of 10 with overland
flight 15. Their melee Reach is 2.</p>

<p>Adult Green Dragons still Large. They’re Level 12 Solo <em>Controllers</em>, which
doesn’t look right to me as I’d expect the role of a given dragon to remain
constant. Anyway, they have 620 HP, with poison resistance 20 and the same speed
and reach as the young green dragon. They also have all the same abilities,
which confirms that the Controller label is a mistake. On top of those they add
Lashing Tail, an Aura 1 that makes its area difficult terrain for anyone other
than the dragon while it’s on the ground.</p>

<p>The Elder Green Dragon is basically an up-gunned adult, size Huge. They’re Level
19 Solo Controllers (see above) with 910 HP. Their poison resistance is 25,
their land speed is 10, their flight speed 14 with overland flight 18. Their
melee reach is 3, the area of their Frightful Presence is 10, and so is their
ongoing damage. Everything else is the same.</p>

<p>The Ancient Green Dragon is Gargantuan, a level 27 solo controller with 1250
HP. Its Lashing Tail is an Aura 2, its poison resistance is 30, and its speeds
are the same as the elder’s. It has all the same abilities with appropriately
increased damage and melee Reach 4, and adds a new one.</p>

<p>Mind Poison is a Ranged 20 charm power that targets the Will of a target taking
ongoing poison damage. On a hit, it inflicts a -2 penalty to attacks and
skill/ability checks by that character. After the first failed save, the target
os also dazed. And after the second failure, the target can no longer act to
harm the dragon and the effect becomes <em>permanent</em> until the dragon is slain or
a ritual like Remove Affliction is used to cure them. Yay, another gradual doom
effect!</p>

<p>Now, it’s not 100% clear to me if the daze and -2 penalties persist once the
victim fails the second save. Personally, I’m inclined to say it doesn’t, and
that the victim becomes a NPC servant of the dragon who’s able to act with their
full capacity. This <em>is</em> an epic power from one of the scariest monsters in the
book.</p>

<h2 id="green-dragon-monster-vault">Green Dragon (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>Monster Vault green dragons are skirmishers at all age categories. They have the
same senses as their MV counterparts, and their stat blocks drop Overland Flight
and add Forest Walk to their land speed, allowing them to ignore forest-themed
difficult terrain.</p>

<p>Its bite still does physical and ongoing poison damage on a hit, and does a bit
of poison damage on a miss. Its claws are only slightly weaker, and allow the
dragon to shift 2 squares on a hit. It can still make two claw attacks on its
action, but only against the same target. So it could use the first shift to get
around the target, and the second to get away!</p>

<p>The Breath Weapon is largely the same, down to the slow aftereffect. Flyby
Attack is still here but no longer forbids opportunity attacks. On the other
hand, the dragon <em>can</em> use its breath instead of a bite if it’s recharged.</p>

<p>Luring Glare is still a minor action, and has been turned into a Close Blast 10
that affects one creature. The practical effect of this change is that it no
longer provokes opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>Tail Sweep and Frightful Presence are gone, but Bloodied Breath remains. For
passive traits we have the usual Action Recovery, plus Poisonous Wounds and
Instinctive Flyby.</p>

<p>Poisonous Wounds is an Aura 1 that becomes active once the dragon is
bloodied. Enemies take age-dependent poison damage when they enter or start
their turns there, and that damage doubles if the enemy is also
bloodied. Instinctive Flyby is an automatic flyby attack at 10+rolled
initiative, granting a +4 bonus to defenses against opportunity attacks. As
usual for instinctive actions, if the dragon can’t perform it due to a stunning
or dominating effect then that effect ends.</p>

<p>The Young Green Dragon is a Large Level 5 Solo Skirmisher with 252 HP, 10 poison
resistance, land speed 8 (forest-walk) and fly speed 10. It has all the
abilities outlined above with Melee reach 2.</p>

<p>The Elder Green Dragon is a Huge Level 19 Solo Skirmisher with 720 HP, 15 poison
resistance, land speed 10 (forest-walk) and fly speed 14. It has all the
abilities above (with melee Reach 3) plus Cunning Glance, which allows it to use
Luring Glare as a reaction to an enemy shifting to a square within 2 squares of
itself.</p>

<p>You can use some interpolation to get the other dragon age categories, and I’d
be tempted to add Mind Poison to the late-Epic Ancient Green Dragon too.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>The MM gives us two sample encounters.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7, a young green dragon and assorted kobold riffraff. Pretty standard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13, an adult green dragon and a couple of banshrae warriors. It makes
perfect sense that a green dragon would buddy up with evil fey when you think
about it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>From what I’ve seen in published material, it usually feels like green dragons
tend to be somewhat ignored by writers. Black dragons live in pretty similar
environments and are more outwardly sinister, so they’re a bit more popular.</p>

<p>Still, I think their abilities make them effective as solo encounters,
particularly in the MV version, and Mind Poison is a surprisingly scary
ability. Personality-wise they’re also cool, since they’re highly likely to
<em>talk</em> to the party instead of attacking right away. Sure, they’re lying liars
who lie, but it at least makes for some interesting banter.</p>

<p>Adult or older green dragons could conceivably end up joining a fey court. So
your party arrives to fight the dragon extorting the nearby kingdom and find
themselves drawn into a Feywild court where the dragon is a respected noble with
enough connections to make itself immune to a direct assault. Can they convince
the other courtiers that the beast is a villain? Would they care if it was?</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Compared to the other chromatics, white dragons are stupid and kinda
runty. They’re still dragons, though, so adventurer parties should take them a
little more seriously than their cousins do.</p>

<p>This is a rare case where the Monster Manual has a little more information about
this specific monster than the Monster Vault. Still, both agree that white
dragons are gluttonous and greedy, and usually like making their lairs in very
cold places like arctic regions, permafrost-covered mountaintops, or near rifts
to a cold part of the Elemental Chaos. This is just personal preference,
though - they’re not particularly vulnerable to fire and heat. You could meet
one in more temperate or warm terrain either because it likes the heat or
because it chose to <em>make</em> its lair cold with its ice powers (which grow in
number and potency as the dragon ages).</p>

<p>White dragons are very interested in increasing the size of their hoards and
securing their next meal, but aren’t fond of hatching complicated plots to do
either of those things. They’re also a bit lazy, so they can be bribed to
prevent more damaging attacks on inhabited regions. Treasure-wise, they favor
gems and like clear diamonds above all others… but a pile of meat will do the
job just as well as a pile of diamonds.</p>

<p>Like all dragons, whites are Natural Magical Beasts (dragons). Let’s look at
their stats in order of level (and age).</p>

<h2 id="fledgling-white-dragon">Fledgling White Dragon</h2>

<p>Present only in the Monster Vault, this <em>almost</em> makes me a liar when I said 4e
doesn’t give any stats to hatchlings. A fledgling is a dragon who just learned
how to fly, which takes long enough for it to grow to size Large. This is a
Level 1 Solo Brute with 128 HP.</p>

<p>The fledgling has trained Athletics and Perception, darkvision and 5 cold
resistance. It has land and flight speeds of 6 with ice walk, which means it
ignores ice- or snow-based difficult terrain.</p>

<p>The fledgling is not yet old enough to engage in initiative-based shenanigans,
but it does have a Savage Blood trait which causes it to score criticals on a
17-20 while bloodied.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 2 bite that does more damage than expected for a
Level 1 brute, which makes sense given the lack of multi-attack abilities
here. Instead of biting it can make 2 claw attacks that also have Reach 2 and do
standard physical damage.</p>

<p>The fledgling’s icy breath weapon is a Close Blast 5 that targets Reflex, does
cold damage and slows on a hit, and recharges on 5-6. On a miss, it does half
damage.</p>

<p>It someone hits the dragon while flanking it, it can retaliate with a Tail Slap
as a reaction, which targets Fortitude, does some physical damage, and pushes
the target 3 squares.</p>

<p>As usual for dragons, as soon as it becomes bloodied it recharges and uses its
breath weapon immediately. This trait is named Bloodied Breath and I will refer
to it as such from now on.</p>

<p>This is literally Baby’s First Dragon, meant to be easy both for the PCs to
fight and for the GM to run. It dispenses with several of the more complicated
dragon tricks like instinctive actions and Frightful Presence. It could serve as
the first “boss battle” at the end of a low-level dungeon that doesn’t give the
PCs time for a long rest. Or you could take a page from OD&amp;D and put one of
these guarding a sizable pile of treasure in a side area that requires a little
effort to find - an easy dragon fight and its attendant hoard are one of the
classic dungeon “bonus areas”.</p>

<h2 id="young-white-dragon">Young White Dragon</h2>

<p>This one is present in both books. It’s grown enough to have the full array of
dragon abilities, but it’s still size Large. It’s a Level 3 Solo Brute with 200
HP and the same senses and movement as the fledgling. Its cold resistance is
raised to 10. The MM also lists an Overland Flight speed of 10, which I think
was dropped as a concept from the MV stat blocks. This means it’s better at
covering long distances outside of combat.</p>

<p>From here on out the stat blocks are almost entirely different, so we’ll start
with the MM version and then the MV one.</p>

<p>The MM version has two basic attacks: a Reach 2 bite that does a mix of physical
and cold damage with extra cold damage if it’s an opportunity attack; and a
Reach 2 Claw that does physical damage. These are combined in the Dragon’s Fury
ability, a standard action that allows the dragon to make two claw attacks and
bite a target that it hits with both.</p>

<p>The breath weapon is similar to the fledgling’s, and both slows and weakens on a
hit in addition to its cold damage (save ends both). In addition to Bloodied
Breath, the young white dragon gains Frightful Presence, a standard-action
encounter power that targets Will and affects all enemies in a Close Burst 5. On
a hit this <em>stuns</em> for a turn, with a -2 attack penalty as an aftereffect (save
ends).</p>

<p>The MV version is a lot more similar to the fledgling, but with increased stats
due to its higher level. The bite does a goodly amount of pure cold damage, and
does some damage even on a miss. The breath weapon doesn’t weaken, but still
slows. Savage Blood, Tail Slap and Bloodied Breath are still here, but instead
of Frightful Presence the MV young white has two other dragon signature traits
from the late-4e era: Action Recovery and an automatic “instinctive” action.</p>

<p>Action Recovery is a passive trait that ends any dazing, stunning or dominating
effect on the dragon when its turn ends. This is equivalent to saying the dragon
automatically saves against these effects, and is an important element in making
it viable as a solo enemy.</p>

<p>The automatic action for white dragons is Instinctive Rampage. On an initiative
of 10+the dragon’s score, it can make a free move action during which it gains
Resist 5 to all damage. It can go through enemy spaces, and make a free claw
attack against each enemy whose space it crosses. If this claw attack hits, the
target also falls prone. If the dragon can’t take this action due to a stunning
or dominating effect, that effect ends instead. Got all that?</p>

<p>Overall, I think the MV dragon is clearly the best of the two. The Instinctive
Rampage is a little more complex than the MM powers, but in the end I prefer it
over the traditional Frightful Presence, which oscillates between “wasted
action” and “frustrating for players” depending on how successful it is. In
addition the MV dragon is simply harder to pin down and more capable of making
multiple attacks, a theme we’ll find persists throughout this multi-entry.</p>

<h2 id="adult-white-dragon">Adult White Dragon</h2>

<p>This one is present only in the Monster Manual. It’s still Large, but likely
bigger than the young version. It’s a Level 9 Solo Brute with 408 HP. Its land
and flight speed go up to 7, and its cold resistance to 20. It is otherwise
pretty much an upgunned young white dragon, with the same abilities at its
disposal.</p>

<p>You could get the equivalent Monster Vault variant by increasing the level of
its own Young White Dragon.</p>

<h2 id="elder-white-dragon">Elder White Dragon</h2>

<p>This one is present in both books. A dragon this old is Huge, and a Level 17
Solo Brute with 850 HP (668 in the MV). Its land and flight speed go up to 8,
and its cold resistance to 25 (15 in the MV). The lower HP and cold resistance
is notable here, and likely a product of the new monster math.</p>

<p>Both versions have all the same abilities of their respective Young versions,
only its melee reach is now 3.  There’s an important addition in the form of Icy
Tomb, a standard-action power that recharges on a 5-6. In both versions, it’s a
Ranged 10 ability that targets Reflex and encases the target in ice, but its
mechanical representation differs quite a bit.</p>

<p>In the Monster Manual, it does about 75% of the damage of the dragon’s breath
and both restrains and stuns the target (save ends both). In the Monster Vault,
it stuns, explicitly spells out that the target cannot be pushed, pulled or
slid, and does <em>45 ongoing cold damage</em> (save ends all).</p>

<p>Clearly an elder white dragon is going to spend one of its action points on Icy
Tomb shortly before it uses its breath. There’s no better way to say “I hate
you specifically” to the party’s fire sorcerer.</p>

<h2 id="ancient-white-dragon">Ancient White Dragon</h2>

<p>This MM-only entry is a Gargantuan Level 24 Solo Brute with 1145 HP! It can do
everything the MM Elder White Dragon can, and has Cold Resistance 30 and
movement speed of 9 in the ground and in the air.</p>

<p>The big addition here is the Aura of Winter, which has a radius of 5. Any
creature caught in the area takes 30 cold damage, the ground within is treated
as difficult terrain, and flying creatures halve their speed. Creatures in the
aura have concealment against ranged attacks. This includes the dragon, of
course, and it might prompt some adventurers to try to stay inside to reduce the
chances of being hit with Icy Tomb… If they <em>are</em> hit with it, though, they’re
looking at 75 cold damage per turn.</p>

<p>This dragon is likely to be encountered as a truly solo boss for level 21-22
characters, since there are few creatures that can stand its aura. A squad of
ice devils would work very nicely as backup, though.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The two sample encouinters in the MM are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4, a young white dragon and a dragonborn soldier. This one likely
happens at the end of a dungeon filled with kobold cultists and the occasional
dragonborn lieutenant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 11, an adult white dragon and a trio of galeb duhrs (humanoid earth
elementals). This is likely more of an accidental symbiotic relationship than
a proper organization.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Black dragons are the sneakiest, and gothiest, of the chromatics. Their
favorite environment is a dismal dark swamp beneath whose fetid waters they can
hide to ambush their victims. Gloomy forests, acidic lakes under dank mountain
dungeons and places that touch the Shadowfell are also good lair material.</p>

<p>Every chromatic dragon seems to have some signature personality trait in
addition to greed. For black dragons, that trait is cruelty. These sadistic
creatures will hunt even when they’re not hungry just for the pleasure of
torturing and killing a victim. For minions, they typically enlist tribes of
lizardfolk and other swamp-dwellers. They’re also the first dragons in the
chromatic power ladder that might engage in complex plots to acquire more
treasure and power over their surroundings.</p>

<p>Black dragons breathe sprays of acid, and can envelop themselves in a shroud of
darkness. So even if a black dragon’s lair isn’t naturally gloomy and caustic,
they’ll make it so. They’re also amphibious, which is particularly annoying to
adventurers since it means their hoards will often be hidden underwater.</p>

<p>Like all dragons, they’re Natural Magical Beasts with the Dragon keyword. Unlike
other dragons, they also have the Aquatic keyword, which allows them to breathe
underwater and enjoy a +2 attack bonus against non-aquatic opponents while in
there.</p>

<p>All black dragon age categories in each book represent increasingly powerful
versions of the same monster, with the main differences being between the MM and
MV representations, so we’ll discuss the stats by book and not by age category.</p>

<h2 id="black-dragon-monster-manual">Black Dragon (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The MM black dragon has trained Perception, Nature and Stealth, along with
Darkvision and Acid Resistance that varies with age. It can move equally fast on
land, water and in the air, with a further increased overland flight speed.</p>

<p>In every age category it has two basic attacks: a bite that does physical damage
and ongoing acid damage (save ends), and a weak claw. Its Double Attack ability
allows it to make 2 claw attacks as a standard action. The breath weapon is the
usual Reflex-targeting Close Blast 5 that recharges on a 5-6. It does acid
damage, ongoing acid damage, and gives a -4 penalty to AC (save ends both). Its
final standard-action abilities are our familiar Frightful Presence and Cloud of
Darkness.</p>

<p>The Cloud of Darkness ability creates a zone of darkness on a Close Burst 2,
which blocks line of sight for all creatures except the dragon. Anyone fully
inside it (except the dragon!) is also blinded, so darkvision won’t save you
here. The zone lasts a turn but can be sustained with a minor action, and the
power recharges on a 3-6. I’m guessing this is more of an inky chemical smoke
thing than simple darkness.</p>

<p>For triggered abilities, it can count on the traditional Bloodied Breath, and on
a Tail Slash that triggers as a reaction when someone misses the dragon with a
melee attack. This is attack does a bit more damage than a claw and pushes the
target 1 square.</p>

<p>Young black dragons are Large Level 4 Solo Lurkers with 208 HP, Acid Resistance
15, speed 7, and Reach 2 on their melee attacks. They’re clumsy fliers, but have
an overland flight speed of 10.</p>

<p>Adult black dragons are Large Level 11 Solo Lurkers with 560 HP, Acid Resistance
20, speed 8, overland flight 10, and Reach 2 on their melee attacks. Their
flight is no longer clumsy and gains the “hover” keyword.</p>

<p>Elder black dragons are Huge Level 18 Solo Lurkers with 860 HP, Acid Resistance
25, Speed 9, overland flight 12, and Reach 3 on their melee attacks. They also
gain a new ability: Vitriolic Spray, an encounter power that’s basically a new
breath weapon. It does a bit less damage than the standard breath, but blinds on
a hit (save ends). Obviously, the dragon retains its normal breath weapon attack
as well.</p>

<p>Ancient black dragons are Gargantuan Level 26 Solo Lurkers with 1190 HP, Acid
Resistance 30, Speed 10, Overland Flight 15, and Reach 4 on their melee
attacks. They replace the standard Cloud of Darkness with Acid Gloom, which
works the same but also deals acid damage to any creature that enters or starts
its turn within. While the dragon itself would technically take this damage, its
resistance makes it immune to it.</p>

<h2 id="black-dragon-monster-vault">Black Dragon (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The MV black dragons have the same senses, trained skills and movement modes as
the MM versions. Their acid resistance is a bit smaller, and it seems their
speed is a bit lower at the higher ages. Oh, and they gain Swamp Walk, allowing
them to ignore swampy difficult terrain. I only now realize the MM dragons
didn’t have this, which is a glaring oversight.</p>

<p>At all age categories, their basic attack is a bite that does physical damage
plus ongoing acid damage on a hit, and a little bit of acid damage on a
miss. They can instead make two slightly weaker claw attacks, which end up
stronger than the bite if both hit the same target. The breath weapon does acid
damage and ongoing acid damage, without the AC penalty from the MM version.</p>

<p>Cloud of Darkness is replaced with Shroud of Gloom, a Close Burst 5 that
automatically gives everyone caught in it acid vulnerability and a -2 penalty to
attacks <em>until the end of the encounter</em>. A PC can spend a standard action to
make a Heal check and clear this condition from an ally. The DC of this test is
age-based, but not very hard - clearly the cost here is wasting a standard
action on it. Think of it as a thin layer of caustic gunk that must be scraped
off. I suppose a generous GM might allow a healing power to be used instead, but
this is purely a personal decision. This power is Recharge 6, too, so it’s going
to be a problem more than once per battle.</p>

<p>For passive traits, they have the already-familiar Aquatic and Action Recovery,
plus Acid Blood and Instinctive Devouring. Acid Blood deals acid damage to
everyone adjacent to the dragon every time it takes damage while
bloodied. Instinctive Devouring allows the dragon to bite or charge someone as
its 10+rolled initiative action, or to end any stunning or dominating effect
that would prevent it from doing so.</p>

<p>Its triggered actions are Bloodied Breath and Tail Sweep. That last one is
triggers when someone misses the dragon with a melee attack. It has a Reach 1
greater than standard for the age category, and targets Reflex. On a hit the
target takes damage, falls prone, and everyone adjacent to it takes some
automatic physical damage.</p>

<p>Young Black Dragons in the MV are Large Level 4 Solo Lurkers with 208 HP. Their
acid resistance is 10, their speed 7, their melee Reach 2 (3 for the tail), and
their ongoing/incidental damage for the acid powers and the tail is 5.</p>

<p>Elder Black Dragons are Huge Level 18 Solo Lurkers with 676 HP. Their acid
resistance is 15, their speed 8, their melee reach 3 (4 for the tail) and their
ongoing/incidental damage 10. They also gain a new ability, Acid Gob, a Ranged
10 attack that targets Reflex. On a hit, the target is blinded and takes 30
ongoing acid damage (save ends both).</p>

<p>You should be able to easily interpolate the other age categories based on this.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The two sample encounters in the MM are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5, a young black dragon and 2 dark creepers. This is that Shadowfell
flavor at work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13, an adult black dragon, 2 trolls and a bog hag. Swamp dwellers unite!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>In my experience, black dragons are the second most popular variant, being the
go-to choice for when you think a white is too weak and a red too strong. I note
that both versions of black dragons lack powers that would do increased damage
when it attacks from hiding, though I think that’s actually OK here. This is a
solo lurker, so it needs to be able to do something effective every turn or the
fight will take twice as long. Still, this is a dragon that benefits even more
from being a part of an encounter group than the others.</p>

<p>The second sample encounter above is the more effective of the two, since the
trolls would be good at occupying the party’s attention while the dragon strikes
from ambush. For added Fun(TM), you can say the dragon or the hag have used a
ritual to give them acid resistance and/or eliminate their weakness against
acid. If Pathfinder: Kingmaker can do it, so can you!</p>

<p>Elder black dragons sound like they could hang out with aboleths, since their
lairs could conceivably reach into the depths of the Underdark. The question
then becomes, who is using who? Clever GMs can find a way to make the answer be
“Both”.</p>
