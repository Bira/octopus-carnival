<p>We already looked at <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/06/23/lizardfolk.html">lizardfolk</a> during our reading of the first Monster
Manual and the Monster Vault. As we saw before, there are several different
ethnicities of lizardfolk. The first MM had the human-sized “greenscales” and
the larger “blackscales”. The Vault also contained a “poisonscale” type, which
turns out to have debuted here in the MM2.</p>

<p>Poisonscale lizardfolk have a smaller and slighter build than greenscales,
though they’re still Medium. To make up for their lack of brute strength, they
developed a kind of internal alchemy: by eating certain specific plants, they
can sweat poison. They usually apply this poison to their weapons, but some
poisonscales like to apply it directly to their enemies by wrestling with them.</p>

<p>The lore in this entry is more focused on the individual stat blocks than on
overall lizardfolk culture, so presumably everything that was said in the first
Monster Manual still applies here. The stat blocks themselves are different
enough from what we got in the MV to be worth discussing.</p>

<p>All lizardfolk in this entry are Medium Natural Humanoids with the Swamp Walk
ability, allowing them to ignore swampy difficult terrain. They also usually do
something poison-related, though the specifics vary per stat block.</p>

<h2 id="poisonscale-magus">Poisonscale Magus</h2>

<p>These spellcasters specialize in toxic magic. They occupy positions as honored
advisers in poisonscale communities, but this power and respect comes at a
cost. Their own magic poisons them, and shortens their lives.</p>

<p>Magi are Level 2 Artillery with 32 HP and speed 6, carrying <strong>daggers</strong> into
battle for use as implements and in emergencies. All of their spells target
Fortitude, so they’re a threat to your squishies.</p>

<p>In a fight a magus is likely to open up with a <strong>Poison Barrage</strong> (encounter) an
area burst attack that deals poison damage and inflicts Vulnerable 5 Poison on
thise it hits (save ends). A miss does half damage and inflicts the
vulnerability for a turn.</p>

<p>Then they’ll target individual vulnerable enemies with <strong>Poison Blood</strong>, a
ranged spell that deals immediate and ongoing poison damage (save ends). As a
minor action it can also use <strong>Corrupt Poison</strong>, a ranged spell that slides
someone suffering from ongoing poison damage 3 squares and slows them (save
ends).</p>

<p>There are enough interesting interactions here that the magus works more like a
fragile Controller than as Artillery.</p>

<h2 id="poisonscale-slitherer">Poisonscale Slitherer</h2>

<p>This represents your typical poisonscale warrior. Their slight build makes them
a bit cowardly, but they have good teamwork and their somewhat oversized tails
make them very stable.</p>

<p>Slitherers are Level 2 Soldiers with 36 HP and speed 5. They carry <strong>spears</strong>
for melee combat, and <strong>javelins</strong> for fighting at range. They prefer that last
one because it’s safer, and because their javelins are poisoned! This manifests
as a secondary attack against Fortitude, which does about double the damage of
the initial hit.</p>

<p>Their ironically named <strong>slitherer bravery</strong> trait gives them a +2 attack bonus
when adjacent to at least one ally, and <strong>slitherer stability</strong> makes them
immune to knockdowns and forced movement. That’s surprisingly powerful for a
level 2 soldier, and makes them an excellent wizard counter-measure.</p>

<h2 id="poisonscale-savage">Poisonscale Savage</h2>

<p>This warrior doesn’t bother with fiddly stuff like poisoning weapons or personal
hygiene. It slaps enemies with its tail to cover them in poisoned sweat, and
them clubs them to death while they’re weakened.</p>

<p>The savage is a Level 2 Brute with 45 HP and speed 6. It will probably start the
fight with the single <strong>javelin</strong> it carries, which damages and inflicts ongoing
poison damage because it’s all sweaty. After that it attacks with a
<strong>greatclub</strong>, and can slap with its <strong>tail</strong> as a minor action. The tail does
no damage, but inflicts ongoing 5 poison damage on a hit (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="poisonscale-collector">Poisonscale Collector</h2>

<p>Collectors are responsible for gathering the special plants that allow
poisonscales to produce their poison. This means they’re also trained
herbalists and alchemists. They’re Level 3 Lurkers with 36 HP and speed 6.</p>

<p>Collectors are armed with <strong>Daggers</strong>, which do physical and ongoing poison
damage. Once an enemy is taking ongoing poison damage from this or any other
source, the collector can do several unpleasant things to them.</p>

<p>First of all, the <strong>Poison Strike</strong> passive trait gives them a +2 damage bonus
against poisoned targets. <strong>Blinding Poison</strong> is a spell that targets a poisoned
creature’s Fortitude, dealing damage and blinding them on a hit (save ends). And
<strong>End Strike</strong> is a stab that targets someone who can’t see the collector and
does a bunch of physical damage.</p>

<p>So this is one of those lurkers who can do something harmful to the PCs every
turn, though it takes a bit longer to activate its ultimate attack. That process
can be sped up if it has additional buddies who can inflict ongoing poison
damage.</p>

<h2 id="poisonscale-myrmidon">Poisonscale Myrmidon</h2>

<p>A veteran warrior, fighting in a more disciplined manner with a club and a
shield. It’s a Level 3 Soldier with 47 HP and speed 6. Its only attack is a
<strong>club</strong> that damages and marks on a hit, but it also has the collector’s
<strong>Poison Strike</strong> trait.</p>

<p>Myrmidons can’t poison enemies themselves, so they rely on the support of other
allies who can. They’re good to pad the ranks of an all-poisonscale force,
though you’re probably better off using lizardfolk from the other books if you
have a mixed force or want more interesting mechanics.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The poison theming here is interesting, and several of these stat blocks don’t
get repeated in the Vault, so it’s worth it to update them. As long as you avoid
the extra-xenophobic lore in the Vault, its stat blocks are good.</p>

            <p>I remember reading a few play reports about a campaign titled “Mecha Against the
Giants” a few years ago. It was run by Mark Langsdorf, using GURPS as a rule
system, and it was vaguely inspired by the Against the Giants modules for AD&amp;D.</p>

<p>One of these days, I really want to run something like that using LANCER. As of
this writing I definitely don’t have the bandwidth for it, but I just thought it
would be nice to write it down.</p>

<p>Desperate, the King’s wizards and priests spend the last of their power in a

<p>I first saw a krenshar in the 3e Monster Manual, though it’s possible they
originated a bit earlier than that.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Krenshars are large carnivorous felines somewhat similar in size and behavior to
lions. They live in groups called prides, and use teamwork to hunt. Some
individuals within the pride grow to a larger size than the rest and possess a
pattern of blood red spots on their fur. These seem to have a higher social
position within the pride, and focus on protecting it from threats rather than
on everyday hunting.</p>

<p>The thing that makes krenshars fantastical is their ability to peel back the
skin on their faces and expose their skulls in order to intimidate their enemies
and frighten their prey.</p>

<p>While I agree a krenshar’s display must be quite a striking sight, your typical
PC is likely to have met quite a few things that are scarier than that even if
they’re relatively low level. This leads me to believe their threat display
might be augmented by natural fear magic, since it’s meant to be effective even
against adventurers.</p>

<p>Gnolls, hobgoblins and humans frequently try to domesticate krenshars for all
the usual reasons. This is a difficult process because it’s hard to suppress
their threat display, so lots of trainers end up paralyzed by fear and killed.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We’re given two krenshar stat blocks here. Both are Medium Natural Beasts with a
land speed of 8 and low-light vision. They also have two signature abilities:</p>

<p>Their <strong>Fearsome Visage</strong> is an aura (5) that inflicts a -2 penalty to saves
against fear effects to all enemies caught inside. <strong>Unnerving Skull</strong> is a
minor action usable once per round. It’s a close burst 5 that targets the Will
of one enemy and inflicts a -2 attack penalty on a hit (save ends). This is
a fear power, so it’s enhanced by the aura.</p>

<h3 id="krenshar">Krenshar</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 4 Controller with 55 HP and all standard traits. Its
basic attack is a <strong>hooking swipe</strong> that damages and knocks prone on a hit. It
can combine its threat display with a roar to perform the <strong>Roaring Skull</strong>
attack, a Close Blast 5 that targets Will and dazes (save ends). A target who is
already dazed is instead weakened for the duration of the daze, so there’s
benefit in several krenshars roaring at once. This recharges on a 5+, so it will
likely happen more than once in the fight.</p>

<h3 id="krenshar-blood-slayer">Krenshar Blood Slayer</h3>

<p>The red-spotted variety, focusing more on physical power than on scary
roars. It’s a Level 5 Brute with 75 HP and all standard traits. Its basic attack
is a <strong>claw</strong> that is somewhat weak, but can be used twice per action. If both
attacks hit, the target is grabbed and the slayer can <strong>bite</strong> it. Bites hit
automatically and do double the damage of a claw strike.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I guess your typical krenshar pack will include a mix of blood slayers and
standard krenshars. The krenshars open up with a “volley” of Roaring Skull
attacks, and then the blood slayers focus on grabbing dazed/weakened individuals
and biting them to death. Grabbing a squishy is always a good move, but it’s
also worth their while to try it with the defenders, since their bites don’t
care about AC.</p>

<p>The sample encounters are a pair of deathpledged gnolls wrangling a pack of
krenshars (level 5), and a human slaver with a pair of javelin dancer goons and
a trio of blood slayers (level 6).</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/10/24/kenku.html">Let&#39;s Read the 4e Monster Vault 2: Kenku</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <figure class="center">

</figure>

<p>Kenku are raven-people, humanoid and human-sized but covered in feathers and
with raven heads. They organize themselves into clan-like groups called
flocks. Your typical kenku flock is tightly knit but very distrustful of
outsiders, including kenku from other flocks. Each flock follows no laws but
their own. Despite this, most of them live on or near major cities, and engage
in a variety of illegal activities to survive.</p>

<p>So yeah. Crime birbs.</p>

<p>Kenku criminals tend to prefer non-violent activities such as grifts and cons,
where their natural ability to mimic sounds and voices comes in handy. They can
still fight pretty well if forced to. And despite the stereotyping they’re
typically Unaligned, which means it’s definitely possible to find nicer
individuals and flocks out there. Rural kenku can easily fill the same
“isolationist but ultimately nice” role as cliche elven villages, and an urban
flock could be predominantly performers or even a legitimate company for a nice
change of pace.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Kenku are Medium Natural Humanoids. They have low-light vision, a ground speed
of 6, and no innate flight speed despite being birds. They possess two
interesting signature abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Flock Effect</strong> makes them good at teamwork: they gain a +3 attack bonus when
flanking and grant a +3 when using Aid Another, instead of the usual +2 to both
activities.</p>

<p><strong>Mimicry</strong> allows them to mimic any sound or voice. You have to win an opposed
roll of your Insight vs. their Bluff to realize the sound is fake. Not all kenku
in this entry are trained in Bluff, but the sneakier ones are.</p>

<p>Their levels are all in the early-to-mid Heroic tier, which in my mind means
they’d be about as common as elves or halflings. They get playable stats at the
end of this book, but I’m not sure if they ever got a full writeup later on.</p>

<h3 id="kenku-ruffian">Kenku Ruffian</h3>

<p>Your typical crime-birb-on-the-street is a Level 3 Minion Skirmisher. They only
have a basic <strong>club</strong> attack and the universal signature abilities, so they’re
pretty much civilians despite the name “Ruffian”. If forced to fight they rely
on numbers to hold the line while one or two of them go get help.</p>

<h3 id="kenku-warrior">Kenku Warrior</h3>

<p>Formally trained in a mobile fighting style, the warrior uses paired daggers and
moves in a seemingly random pattern about the battlefield. Warriors are Level 3
Skirmishers with 44 HP.</p>

<p>Their <strong>daggers</strong> can be used as melee or ranged attacks (they carry 6). The
<strong>Fluttering Attack</strong> maneuver allows them to shift 4 squares and make a dagger
attack during the movement, and <strong>Combat Advantage</strong> gives them a damage
bonus. They also have the universal traits, so combat advantage is even better
for them and they have an easy time acquiring it.</p>

<h3 id="kenku-ringleader">Kenku Ringleader</h3>

<p>Ringleaders lead small gangs of kenku in heists or raids, though they have
enough sense to sound a retreat if guards or rivals show up in force. They’re
Level 4 Soldiers with the Leader tag and 54 HP. They’re trained in Bluff and
and Intimidate.</p>

<p>They use a <strong>spiked chain</strong> in melee and a <strong>sling</strong> at range. The chain attack
is Reach 2 and marks on a hit. They <strong>Press the Attack</strong> maneuver is a chain
strike that targets a marked enemy, does the usual damage, and knocks them prone
on a hit.</p>

<p>They have the two standard kenku traits, and they can use <strong>Flock Reaction</strong>
(minor; recharge 4+) to allow every ally in a close burst 3 to shift 1
square. Perfect for allowing them to disengage and retreat, or finish setting up
a flanking maneuver.</p>

<h3 id="kenku-sneak">Kenku Sneak</h3>

<p>The first actual rogue in the crime birb entry, Sneaks are Level 4 Lurkers with
42 HP. They have a higher than usual speed of 7, and they fight with <strong>daggers</strong>
both in melee and at range. They’re trained in Bluff, Stealth, and Thievery.</p>

<p>As the name implies, the Sneak engages with 4e’s Stealth rules, which dictate
when someone can make a Stealth check to become “hidden” during combat and how
fast they can move while hidden. I think that by default your speed is limited
to 2 in that case - move faster and you’re detected.</p>

<p>Kenku sneaks have an advantage here in that they can move at speed 4 while
hidden. Their <strong>Disappear into the Flock</strong> trait allows them to make those
Stealth checks while they have cover from other kenkus, <strong>Hidden Strike</strong> gives
them a hefty chunk of extra damage if they attack from hiding, and <strong>Sniper</strong>
allows them to remain hidden if they miss with a ranged attack.</p>

<p>The tactics outlined by these traits are nifty. A sneak will always appear
accompanied by a number of warriors or a huge band of ruffians. They’ll hide
among the crowd and move it with, throwing daggers at the squishier PCs for big
damage from a safe distance.</p>

<h3 id="kenku-wing-mage">Kenku Wing Mage</h3>

<p>Though kenku are flightless, it seems they have a magic tradition that seeks to
correct that injustice. Wing mages practice this tradition, and as a result they
know a lot of air and force magic as well. They’re Level 5 Artillery with 50
HP. Wielding <strong>daggers</strong> as weapons and implements, wing mages fight with spells
that create wind and summon flocks of crows made of pure force.</p>

<p>Those force crows can be used in the <strong>Murder of Crows</strong> at-will attack (Ranged
20 vs. Reflex) which does force damage and makes the target grant combat
advantage to the wing mage (save ends). They can also be used in the <strong>Death
Flock</strong> encounter power (area burst 1 within 20 vs. Reflex) which does force
damage and dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>Their main keep-away spell is <strong>Hurricane Blast</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Fortitude;
recharge 5+), which does force damage and slides targets 3 squares. And finally,
<strong>Wings of the Flock</strong> (minor; encounter) gives them a flight speed of 6 until
the end of the encounter.</p>

<p>The wing mage is going to take off as soon as the fight starts, and will rain
force crows upon the PCs from a safe elevation. Most ranged magic has a range
smaller than 20, so the party better have some archers with them.</p>

<h3 id="kenku-assassin">Kenku Assassin</h3>

<p>Either an actual killer-for-hire or an elite combatant. Assassins love poison
and unlike most other kenku they rarely surrender. They’re Level 5 Elite
Skirmishers with 126 HP. They fight with envenomed <strong>daggers</strong> and a
<strong>shortbow</strong> with envenomed arrows, both of which slow the enemy on a hit (save
ends).</p>

<p>They have the same Fluttering Attack as the warriors, and when attacked they can
use <strong>Gouging Talons</strong> as a reaction to hit back. If surrounded, <strong>Feather
Burst</strong> (close burst 2; encounter) can automatically blind every enemy in the
area for a turn, allowing them to escape.</p>

<p>Assassins prefer to stay at range, but once in melee they fight much like
warriors. Their “elite extra attack” is a reaction, so they have an incentive to
stay in the thick of it. Two of them, or one of them plus a squad of warriors,
makes for an interesting encounter where no one stands still. They also go well
with monsters that can exploit the “slowed” status, since they cause that at
will.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have quite a few kenku encounters here, showcasing the sort of monster they
keep as pets and the sort of allies they make into honorary flock members.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 2: 2 kenku warriors, 2 bloodseeker drakes, 1 pseudodragon. Hunters… or
bounty hunters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 3: 1 kenku ringleader, 8 ruffians, and 2 warriors. The whole gang’s
here!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 4: 1 human berserker, 1 ringleader, 6 ruffians, 2 sneaks. Another gang,
this one with an adopted member.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 5: 1 half-elf bandit captain, 2 human berserkers, 1 kenku assassin, 1
kenku wing mage. And this one works the other way around.</p>
  </li>

<p>I like these kenku, though as usual I’d make their description as dastardly
criminals less universal than the book seems to imply. A setting where they’re
as common as the more traditional haflings and elves would be a cool place.</p>

<p>Hydras made their 4e debut in the first Monster Manual, and here we get a few
more of them. Their basic lore remains the same and you can check it out on the
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/06/06/hydra.html">original post</a> I made on the subject.</p>

<p>The hydras on this entry have several passive traits in common: <strong>Threatening
Reach</strong> allows them to make opportunity attacks out to their full melee reach,
instead of only against adjacent enemies. <strong>Many-Headed</strong> makes it resistant to
being dazed on stunning. These conditions only disable one of its heads for a
turn. And <strong>Regenerating Heads</strong> causes the hydra to lose a head at 75%, 50%,
and 25%, regrowing two others at the start of its next turn.</p>

<p>The number of heads an hyda has is important because of <strong>Hydra Fury</strong>, an
at-will power that allows them to make a bite attack for each active head they
have. The effect of an individual bite, and the starting number of heads, vary
per hydra.</p>

<p>Mechanically, MM2 hydras are kind halfway between the ones we saw on the first
Monster Manual, and the ones from the Monster Vault. Most of their mechanics
still work like in the MM1, but Regenerating Heads debuts here and reappears in
a slightly weaker form in the Monster Vault. With the MV version you can prevent
head regrowth by dealing fire or acid damage to the hydra before the start of
its next turn, but nothing can stop it in this version.</p>

<p>These hydras are also lacking the Darkvision and Swim Speed of their relatives
from the other two books, though they still have trained Perception and
<strong>All-Around Vision</strong> that prevents them from being flanked.</p>

<h2 id="razor-hydra">Razor Hydra</h2>

<p>This species of hydra is covered in gleaming metal scales and has extra-sharp
serrated teeth. It’s drawn to the scent of blood in much the same way a shark
is, and one head bites a victim the others get into a frenzy. Because of this,
it’s also known as the Blood Hydra. They are Large Natural Beasts, and Level 16
Solo Brutes with 640 HP and a ground speed of 7. They start with four heads,
gaining extras at 480, 320, and 160.</p>

<p>A razor hydra’s <strong>bite</strong> has Reach 2 and inflicts <em>stackable</em> ongoing physical
damage. A healthy target would take ongoing 5 damage (save ends), but if the
target was already taking ongoing physical<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> damage, then that damage would
increase by 5 instead.</p>

<p>A poor sod on the receiving end of a razor hydra’s Fury attack would have
ongoing <em>20</em> damage (save ends) to deal with, assuming all four bites hit. A
single save will clear it all, but if that save fails and the hydra bites again,
the total will increase even further. There’s no cap!</p>

<p>The <strong>Blood Frenzy</strong> trait makes it so the hydra gains a +2 bonus to attack
targets who are bloodied, or who are taking ongoing physical damage. That’s
one more incentive for it to focus fire on a single PC.</p>

<p>Once the hydra drops to 0 HP, its <strong>Ferocity</strong> allows it to make one last Hydra
Fury attack. At this point it will have seven heads, for a potential 7d8+28
damage plus 35 ongoing damage against a single PC.</p>

<h2 id="heroslayer-hydra">Heroslayer Hydra</h2>

<p>This interestingly-named hydra occupies the same narrative niche as the one
Hercules faced in his labors. As a Huge Natural Beast and a Level 20 Solo Brute,
it’s likely the most powerful hydra in the natural world, and is stronger than
any PC who isn’t an actual demi-god or equivalent. There are stronger specimens,
but you have to travel to the Elemental Chaos to find them.</p>

<p>Heroslayer hydras have 776 HP and five heads at the start of the fight, gaining
new ones at 582, 388, and 194. Its <strong>bites</strong> are Reach 3 and have no riders,
though its <strong>Hydra Fury</strong> deals 10 extra damage to any target hit by two or more
bites. <strong>Rampage</strong> allows it to bite every target in reach and inflict 10
ongoing damage to every target it hits. It recharges whenever the hydra suffers
a critical hit.</p>

<p>The titular <strong>Heroslayer</strong> trait is a big “Fuck You” to defenders everywhere:
while the hydra is marked, it gains a +2 bonus to attack and a +5 bonus to
damage against the creature that marked it. Yes, this applies to every
individual bite in a Fury combo.</p>

<p>So here we have a hydra with a decent incentive to spread its bites around until
a defender marks it, when it will instead focus exclusively on the defender
until they’re good and dead.</p>

<h2 id="chaos-hydra">Chaos Hydra</h2>

<p>This is one of those stronger species native to the Elemental Chaos. Chaos
Hydras start out with only two heads, but their bites are very strong and
infused with deadly elemental energies. The new heads it grows when wounded also
gain new random elemental abilities.</p>

<p>The Chaos Hydra is a Huge Elemental Beast and a Level 22 Solo Brute with 848
HP. It has two Reach 3 basic bite attacks, one for each head: <strong>Frostfire Bite</strong>
deals fire and cold damage, and <strong>Storm Bite</strong> deals lightning and thunder
damage.</p>

<p>Whenever the hydra grows a new head (at 636, 424, and 212 HP), it gains a new
bite attack chosen by a d4 roll. It can gain multiple copies of the same
attack. Its <strong>Hydra Fury</strong> allows it to bite with the two original attacks and
any new ones it might have gained.</p>

<p>The four additional bites deal less base damage but have “save ends”
riders. They are: <strong>Crushing Maw</strong>, which slows and deals ongoing 10 damage;
<strong>Mind bite</strong>, which dazes; <strong>Paralyzing Fang</strong>, which immobilizes and inflicts
a -2 penalty to all defenses; and <strong>Venom Tooth</strong>, which inflicts ongoing 10
poison damage.</p>

<p>Thematically this hydra is all over the place, but that’s the point. It’s hard
for PCs to protect themselves from everything it can do.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Hydras are solitary, so you will usually only find one of them at a
time. However, they’re also frequently followed by opportunistic scavengers who
feed on the remains of their meals and who might be impatient enough to give
them a bit of help with killing those meals. Examples given are carrion crawlers
and shardstorm vortex elementals.</p>

<p>Occasionally, a powerful character might be able to capture a hydra for use as a
guardian. The example encounter given is for this scenario, with a razor hydra
and its minotaur cabalist master.</p>

<p>Hydras are cool, particularly those with the regenerating heads
mechanic. However, I think they should be used sparingly to prevent the novelty
from wearing off.</p>

      <p>I say “physical”, but the strictly correct term would be
“untyped”. Untyped damage is almost always dealt by physical attacks, but
you could have magic powers that also did it. It’s written like “1d8+5
damage” or “ongoing 5 damage” instead of “1d8+5 fire damage” or “ongoing 5
fire damage”. Very few monsters resist it, but none are particularly
vulnerable to it. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
