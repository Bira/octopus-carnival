    <p>If you’ve been reading this blog for a while, you’ll know that I’ve already
converted no less than eleven Pathfinder Iconic characters to Dungeon Fantasy,
one for each of the templates from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 1:
Adventurers</strong>. You’ll also know that you can find a handy list of all of them
in <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">this page</a>, which declares that the project as a whole is done. So why
the heck are you seeing yet another of these articles here?</p>

<p>Well, the simplest reason is because I wanted to do another one. Consider this a
bonus track for the Pathfinder Iconics in Dungeon Fantasy album! As such, it
doesn’t quite follow the rules I set for myself in the main set of eleven
iconics.</p>

<p>You see, our subject today is Seoni the Sorceress. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Seoni.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2007 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I have to say this isn’t one of Wayne Reynolds’ best efforts, since the
proportions and the pose are a bit weird. That aside, Seoni stands out among the
Iconics in that she shows quite a bit of skin, tough at least her bio gives us a
reason for that. That bio is somewhat split between the page containing her
<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/seoni.html">d20 stats</a> and this <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la75?Meet-the-Iconics-Seoni">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>As the Iconic Sorcerer, Seoni represents a class that’s present in the
Pathfinder <em>and</em> d20 core rules, but absent from <strong>DF 1</strong>, which had the
Swashbuckler instead. It’s not hard to see why: any of the “traditional”
spellcasters from <strong>DF 1</strong> are already about as versatile as a d20 Sorcerer. It
would be a while until GURPS had an officially published template that had the
same relationship to the other spellcasters as their d20 counterparts. That
template turned out to be the aptly-named Sorcerer from <strong>Pyramid #3/82</strong>, which
in turn uses rules from <strong>GURPS Thaumathology: Sorcery</strong>.</p>

<p>So now that I’ve explained my reasoning, let’s look at what we can learn from
Seoni’s bio and stats.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>She comes from the land of Varisia, and belongs to the nomadic culture of its
original inhabitants. This culture is roughly analogous to the Romani of our
world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to her mystical bloodline, Seoni has experienced mysterious visions since
a very young age, and her quest to understand those has led to the awakening
of her powers. The tatoos covering most of her body are both a status symbol
in her culture and a focus for her magic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seoni’s obsession with being in control of her own fate combines with her
penchant for detailed plans to make her look like a “control freak” to her
companions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is <em>extremely</em> blasty. The vast majority of her abilities deal direct
damage, usually with fire or lightning. The rest are either straightforward
combat debuffs (<em>glitterdust</em>, <em>dispel magic</em>) or energy barriers (<em>mage
armor</em>, <em>shield</em>, <em>wall of force</em>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our version of Seoni certainly manages to uphold the “less known spells cast
more frequently” motto of the d20 Sorcerer. She knows all of four spells, but
she can cast all of them all day long without even spending FP as long as she
can both move and speak when she does so. She can only use one of them at a
time, but Accelerated Casting allows her to switch effects without pausing. She
can do passably well at social endeavors with her training in Diplomacy and her
Charisma, and can improvise any minor spell with a full cost of 7 points or
less, but what she’s really good at is spamming lightning bolts all day, every
day.</p>

<p>As for power-ups, she can always use more Sorcery spells! Her mundane skills are
lacking a bit, so any spare points there also help. Those players willing to
save points for a while can fully master Dispel Magic for an additional 48
points, which would enable Seoni to cast and maintain 2 effects at once.</p>
