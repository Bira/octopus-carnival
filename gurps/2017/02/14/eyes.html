<p>Today is Valentine’s Day in the US, so this is me making eyes at you. Not that
kind of eyes, though.</p>

<p>In Dragon’s Dogma, the creatures known as Eyes are pure monsters: they have no
natural habitat or ecological niche. They are an expression of corruption from
beyond the Rift, appearing only in places where the world’s veil is thin and
supernatural evil is abundant. While they are living creatures, their forms and
anatomy don’t even pay lip service to normal phisiological principles. Tough
highly intelligent, they never communicate or negotiate, and always try to kill
non-Eyes that run into them.</p>

<p>They come in several varieties, all of which share some of the characteristics
of the Eye of Death found in <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Monsters 1</strong>, p. 14. In fact, the
Eye of Death could easily be another member of the this monster family.</p>

<p><strong>Update (2017-02-21)</strong>: The Gazer has its own stat block now, and is even
nastier with the addition of a couple more gaze attacks.</p>

<h2 id="vile-eyes">Vile Eyes</h2>

<p>The smallest of the bunch, Vile Eyes look like fleshy spheres with a single
lidless eye always staring ahead. While they are not as agile or perceptive as
an Eye of Death, they share the same death gaze ability and can protect
themselves with a nigh-impenetrable energy barrier. Fortunately for their
victims, they can’t do both of those things at the same time. Switching from the
barrier to one of the other powers and back requires a Concentrate maneuver,
giving the PCs a window in which to hit them.</p>

<p>Unlike their larger cousins described in this article, Vile Eyes are usually
found in small groups. Despite their small amount of HP, they are usually
worthies.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 5; <strong>DX</strong> 10; <strong>IQ</strong> 10; <strong>HT</strong> 11</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> -1; <strong>Dodge</strong> 8; <strong>DR</strong> 0;</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 10; <strong>Will</strong> 10; <strong>Per</strong> 10; <strong>FP</strong> 10</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 5.5; <strong>Move</strong> 5 (Air).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Magic Barrier (-)</strong>: Gives the Vile Eye DR 30 and Magic Resistance 10 while
up.</li>
  <li><strong>Death Gaze (Resisted by HT-5)</strong>: 1d toxic damage. Range 20. Cosmic, ignores
DR.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 5; Dark Vision (Color Vision); Doesn’t Breathe; Doesn’t
Eat or Drink; Doesn’t Sleep; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards; Injury Tolerance (No
Brain, No Neck, No Vitals);</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Elder Thing.</p>

<h2 id="evil-eyes">Evil Eyes</h2>

<p>Not to be confused with Vile Eyes, these things are leathery spheres over three
meters in diameter whose body is dominated by a huge fanged maw that opens to
reveal the central eye. A large number of tentacles protrude from the central
body, each one thick as a human leg and tipped by yet another maw. They are
invariably highly proficient spellcasters in addition to possessing debilitating
gaze attacks and a barrier similar to that of the Vile Eyes. The monster’s
tentacles reach beyond the barrier and thus are always vulnerable, but that also
means it doesn’t need to lower the barrier to attack with them!</p>

<p>Evil Eyes are solitary, and they like to clear out a large, spacious portion of
whatever dungeon or region they emerge in for use as a lair. For all anyone
knows, they just sit there waiting for intruders to kill - stories about Evil
Eye lairs tend to be about mysterious places no one returns from. Very few
people know of the creature’s existence. They are obviously boss monsters.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 35; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 16; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +3; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>DR</strong> 5 (body), 0 (eye, tentacles);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 35; <strong>Will</strong> 16; <strong>Per</strong> 16; <strong>FP</strong> 30</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 5 (Air).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Magic Barrier (-)</strong>: Gives the Evil Eye DR 30 and Magic Resistance 10 while
up.</li>
  <li><strong>Debilitating Gaze (-)</strong>: Works as Dispel Magic cast at skill 20. The target
must also resist with HT-5 or be Stunned for seconds equal to the margin of
failure. Range 30.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (14)</strong>: Damage 4d-2 imp. Reach C.</li>
  <li><strong>Tentacle Bite x8 (16)</strong>: 1d imp, plus the target is automatically grappled
at ST 15. Reach 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Spells (-)</strong>: Any the GM deems appropriate, at skill 20 for Hard spells and
19 for Very Hard ones.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 5; Dark Vision (Color Vision); Doesn’t Breathe; Doesn’t
Eat or Drink; Doesn’t Sleep; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards; Indomitable; Injury
Tolerance (No Brain, No Neck, No Vitals); Magery 5; See Invisible; Unfazeable;
Vibration Sense (Air).</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Elder Thing.</p>

<h3 id="tentacles">Tentacles!</h3>

<p>The Evil Eye’s eight tentacles act as indepentent characters. They have ST and
HP 15, Dodge 10, and attack using the statistics shown on the main Evil Eye stat
block. Once they grapple a target, they’ll attempt to drag them to the Eye’s
maw. Multiple tentacles can cooperate in this!</p>

<p>Damaging a tentacle doesn’t damage the Eye itself. Bringing a tentacle to 0 HP
severs it and takes it out of the fight… but the Eye can spend 5 Concentrate
maneuvers with its barrier down to instantly regenerate all of its tentacles!</p>

<h2 id="the-gazer">The Gazer</h2>

<p>Is this particularly ancient Evil Eye? The progenitor of the whole species?
Something else? No one knows. Its true form cannot exist all at once in our
dimension, but the visible bits are an even larger Evil Eye with an even more
terrible bite. It can use both the Evil Eye’s debilitating gaze and the Vile
Eye’s lethal one at will, as well as cast spells or simply slam victims with its
incredible bulk.</p>

<p><strong>ST</strong> 55; <strong>DX</strong> 12; <strong>IQ</strong> 16; <strong>HT</strong> 12</p>

<p><strong>SM</strong> +5; <strong>Dodge</strong> 9; <strong>DR</strong> 5 (body), 0 (eye, tentacles);</p>

<p><strong>HP</strong> 55; <strong>Will</strong> 16; <strong>Per</strong> 16; <strong>FP</strong> 50</p>

<p><strong>Basic Speed</strong> 6; <strong>Move</strong> 5 (Air).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Magic Barrier (-)</strong>: Gives the Gazer DR 30 and Magic Resistance 10 while up.</li>
  <li><strong>Death Gaze (Resisted by HT-5)</strong>: 1d toxic damage. Range 20. Cosmic, ignores
DR.</li>
  <li><strong>Debilitating Gaze (-)</strong>: Works as Dispel Magic cast at skill 20. The target
must also resist with HT-5 or be Stunned for seconds equal to the margin of
failure. Range 30.</li>
  <li><strong>Petryfing Gaze (20 vs. HT)</strong>: As Flesh to Stone (<strong>Magic</strong>, p.51). Range 20.</li>
  <li><strong>Blinding Gaze (20 vs. HT)</strong>: As Strike Blind (<strong>Magic</strong>, p. 38). Range 20.</li>
  <li><strong>Bite (16)</strong>: Damage 6d imp. Reach C.</li>
  <li><strong>Tentacle Bite x16 (16)</strong>: 2d imp, plus the target is automatically grappled
at ST 20. Reach 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Spells (-)</strong>: Any the GM deems appropriate, at skill 20 for Hard spells and
19 for Very Hard ones.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Traits</strong>: Acute Vision 5; Dark Vision (Color Vision); Doesn’t Breathe; Doesn’t
Eat or Drink; Doesn’t Sleep; Immunity to Metabolic Hazards; Indomitable; Injury
Tolerance (No Brain, No Neck, No Vitals); Magery 5; See Invisible; Unfazeable;
Vibration Sense (Air).</p>

<p><strong>Class</strong>: Elder Thing.</p>

<h3 id="even-more-tentacles">Even More Tentacles!</h3>

<p>The main spherical body has no tentacles, but the creature can summon up to 16
of them from rifts that open in the walls or floor <em>and move around at Move
4</em>. Severing a tentacle only means it will be automatically replaced by another
in 2 turns.</p>
