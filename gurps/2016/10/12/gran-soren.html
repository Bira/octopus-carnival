<p>In this article we finish our tour of Gransys by examining its capital of Gran
Soren, which is also its only settlement worthy of the name “city”. As there is
only one very specific place to deal with this time, you’ll get more details on
its history and layout, as well as important NPCs and a <strong>GURPS City Stats</strong>
writeup. This is the last post on the setting of Gransys. Next we’ll move on to
characters!</p>

<h2 id="a-tour-of-gran-soren">A Tour of Gran Soren</h2>

<p>Gran Soren became the capital of Gransys around the time Edmun Dragonsbane
became Duke, fifty years ago. Since then the fledgling town has grown into the
beating heart of all Gransys, as the pawns in the original game are fond of
saying whenever you approach its walls.</p>

<p>The city was built at the mouth of a river near the site of an ancient castle
that predates Gransys itself. Some of its walls still stand, and the roads in
the surrounding countryside weave through them. The city’s own walls are much
newer, and as sturdy as their builders could make them. The space inside them is
further divided into quarters.</p>

<h3 id="craftsmans-quarter">Craftsman’s Quarter</h3>

<p>This is where most of the city’s many workshops and guild halls
stand. Blacksmiths, builders, and other artisans work here. There’s even a small
field worked by tenant farmers. This quarter is also where the Pawn Guild is
located. Its leader is a pawn named Barnaby, who is more articulate than most of
his alien brethren. In addition to hiring out as mercenaries, they also guard a
secret in the guild’s basement: the entrance to a mysterious underground ruin
known to them as the Everfall.</p>

<p>Most weapon and item stores likely to cater to adventurers are in the Urban
Quarter (below), but this is where PCs would come to make large orders or to
hire a large workforce to build a manor or a boat. The Pawn Guild would also be
a frequent destination for groups that include Pawn PCs or that make use of NPC
Pawns.</p>

<h3 id="urban-quarter">Urban Quarter</h3>

<p>This is the city’s largest residential and commercial area. Many of the artisans
who work in the Craftsman’s Quarter have homes in this one, and it also hosts a
large permanent market that sees movement at all hours of the day.</p>

<p>This is where all the “adventurer-friendly” establishments are: inns, taverns,
and stores with large and varied inventories. Any non-magical item that doesn’t
need to be custom-made can be found on sale here, and the stuff that does can be
ordered easily. Fine-quality equipment and even minor magic items are often
found on display, too. Basic necessities such as food or clothes are
considerably more expensive in Gran Soren than in smaller towns or villages, but
their quality and variety is often higher than can be found in those smaller
locations.</p>

<h3 id="the-venery">The Venery</h3>

<p>This is technically part of the Urban Quarter, but you’ll definitely notice when
you’ve wandered into it. It’s the bad part of town, comprised of shabbier houses
and shadier businesses. It’s also where the river meets both the sea and the
city’s sewers. A slum has grown on its margins, and the city’s poorest
inhabitants dredge the mud looking for stray valuables.</p>

<p>There are few guards here, and those are the type that can be bribed to look the
other way. This makes the Venery the perfect meeting spot for criminals and
malcontents. Rumor has it that a skilled forger does business from here, and
it’s also the best place to buy illegal tools.</p>

<h3 id="noble-quarter">Noble Quarter</h3>

<p>This is where the other end of society lives. Somewhat smaller than the other
quarters, its area is mostly occupied by large mansions, an ornate cathedral,
the mint, and the Duke’s palace. Politically, the noble quarter is where all the
real action is at. Duke Edmun’s centralizing efforts mean that to gain favor
with him is to gain power, and the nobles and merchants who make their home here
engage in constant intrigue to do just that.</p>

<p>Others take alternate routes, brokering illicit deals right under the nose of
the Duke’s most loyal agents. Either way, the deals made here affect the entire
duchy.</p>

<p>The Duke holds court from his palace, and is always surrounded by a rotating set
of nobles and merchants. Aside from Edmun himself, other fixtures of the court
are his nephew Fedel and his chamberlain Aldous. Fedel holds the title of Count
of Aernst, but that is a mere formality, as Aernst Castle was attacked and razed
decades ago. Though Fedel is wealthy, he lacks the resources (and, some say, the
will) needed to retake and rebuild the castle. He currently lives in a mansion
in the noble quarter, and makes a living from trade.</p>

<p>Aldous also holds an honorary title (Count of Windbluff), and also has no
interest in claiming its associated land. He is the Duke’s Chamberlain, and the
one who actually conducts most of the day-to-day work of running the duchy. Most
who seek audience with Edmun will find themselves dealing with him instead.</p>

<p>The Noble Quarter is also where Fournival Frescobaldi, Gransys’ wealthiest
merchant, makes his home. He owns a lot of real estate in Gransys and smaller
towns, and his organization moves a lot of goods between these settlements. He
also deals in goods imported from foreign lands, both legally and illegally.</p>
