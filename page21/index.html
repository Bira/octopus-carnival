<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Githzerai were introduced into the game right alongside githyanki. They’re the
other side of the gith coin, the ninjas opposing the pirates. In the books we’re
covering, they only appear in the Monster Manual, but would also feature as a
playable character option in the Player’s Handbook 3.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Githzerai are an austere and contemplative people who follow a philosophy that
espouses discipline and mastery of the self. It might seem weird that they chose
to make their home in the Elemental Chaos, but they see withstanding the
turbulent nature of that plane as an important step on the road to
enlightenment.</p>

<p>Githzerai live in monasteries spread through the Elemental Chaos, where they
dedicate themselves to studying a martial arts style with a strong psionic
component. They use these arts to both defend themselves and to hunt down their
enemies - mainly mind flayers, which they understandably still hate.</p>

<p>Unlike the githyanki, the githzerai aren’t out to conquer the
multiverse. They’ll usually keep to themselves unless someone makes an effort to
rile them up. Like any other people they can produce their share of villains and
heroes, though.</p>

<p>The largest known githzerai settlement is Zerthladun, a large city with many
open fields and markets. It’s one of the few famous spots of order and
tranquility in the Elemental Chaos and probably one of the nicest given that the
list includes the City of Brass.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As far as 4e is concerned, githzerai were monks before it was cool. Speculation
about what the Monk class was going to be like started almost as soon as the
first PHB hit the shelves. A lot of players speculated about a “Ki” power
source, and IIRC the designers themselves began thinking in those terms, but
they soon realized writing up Orientalism as a power source was a bad move.</p>

<p>In the end, monks became psionic strikers and were published in the PHB 3
alongside playable githzerai. I imagine the stat blocks we’re about to see might
have inspired that decision to some degree.</p>

<p>As far as common traits go, githzerai are Medium Natural Humanoids, and are
faster on their feet than githyanki at Speed 7. They have a power named Iron
Mind, which allows them to gain +2 defense against an attack as an interrupt
once per encounter. This will be used to turn an attack that hit by 2 or less
into a miss.</p>

<h3 id="githzerai-cenobite">Githzerai Cenobite</h3>

<p>Cenobites are Level 11 Soldiers with 108 HP, representing the typical martial
artists PCs might meet. Rather than the mobile skirmishers you’d expect monks to
be, they’re the kind of fighter who stands their ground and chases the foe down.</p>

<p>They fight unarmed, and their fists are supposed to cause level-appropriate
damage. Instead of a basic strike they can use an at-will Stunning Fist, which
does a little less damage than the strike but stuns for a turn.</p>

<p>When an enemy shifts away using a movement mode the cenobite also has (i.e,
feet), the cenobite can shift to remain adjacent to them. That means a flying or
teleporting enemy is safe from this.</p>

<p>Their final technique is Trace Chance (Ranged 5; Recharge 6), which hits
automatically and causes the next melee attack made against the target to get a
+5 to-hit bonus and be turned into a critical if it connects. Note that this
attack doesn’t have to be from the cenobite!</p>

<h3 id="githzerai-zerth">Githzerai Zerth</h3>

<p>The counterparth to the githyanki gish, this represents an individual who
balances martial and psychic training. It’s a Level 13 Elite Controller with 248
HP.</p>

<p>Like the cenobite above, the zerth fights unarmed, with the same basic strike
and Trace Chance abilities. Its main ranged attack is Inner Spark (Ranged 5
vs. Reflex), which does lignthning damage and teleports the target 5 squares to
an unnocupied space of the zerth’s choosing.</p>

<p>Further teleport shenanigans are possible with Reorder Chaos (Ranged <em>sight</em>
vs. Fortitude), which targets up to 4 creatures and swaps their positions as the
zerth sees fit.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the zerth can let loose with Psychic Fists (Close Burst 5
vs. Will; enemies only) for some psychic damage. And in addition to Iron Mind,
it also has a technique named Avenging Wind that triggers as an interrupt when
the zerth is targeted with a ranged attack. This redirects the attack to another
creature of its choice within 5 squares, and allows the zerth to teleport up to
10 squares to become adjacent to the attacker.</p>

<p>In addition to fixing the zerth’s damage, I’d probably also give it the ability
to punch twice in an action, since it’s an elite.</p>

<h3 id="githzerai-mindmage">Githzerai Mindmage</h3>

<p>Mindmages put more emphasis on their mental training, though they can still
punch hard. They’re level 14 Artillery with 105 HP.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, their basic melee attack is an unarmed strike. Their main
ranged attack is the Mindstrike (Ranged 20 vs. Reflex), which does psychic
damage and dazes (save ends). Its other options include a Concussion Orb (Area
Burst 2 within 10 vs. Fortitude) that does physical damage and knocks prone, and
a series of Elemental Bolts (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex). Those allow up to 3 attacks
against different targets each of which can do one of fire, lightning, cold or
acid damage at the mindmage’s choice.</p>

<p>Concussion Orb is an encounter power and Elemental Bolts is daily. I don’t think
that makes much difference for a monster, honestly.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: 3 cenobites, a guardian naga, and a firelasher elemental. I’m sure
there’s an interesting story about this one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: 1 mindmage, 1 zerth, and 4 cenobites. Ninja death squad!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I really like these guys. They contrast with githyanki in an interesting way,
being approachable in a way their estranged siblings aren’t. I think it would
also be really cool for them to be the originators of the monk’s mystical
traditions in the setting.</p>

<p>5e would make them more morally ambiguous, saying they don’t mind let innocents
come to harm if it allows them to strike at the mind flayers or githyanki, but I
like them best as an Unaligned people that can produce heroic PCs or dastardly
villains in the same vein as the humans or elves. “Neutral” shouldn’t mean you
do equal amounts of good and evil.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Githyanki are another one of those D&amp;D monsters who surpass the “classic” and
hit the “iconic”. They originally appeared in the AD&amp;D 1st Edition Fiend Folio,
and were the creation of Charles Stross, who today is an award-winning science
fiction author. Here, they’re present in both books.</p>

<p>Judging by the other RPG.net Let’s Reads that are running at the same time as
this one, it seems like 3.x would spill a lot of ink creating other weird
extraplanar people in an attempt to make the “next githyanki”, mostly without
success. 5e would instead attempt to add new lore to them, with what I feel are
mixed results.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A very long time ago, or possibly a very long time in the future, the mind
flayers had a huge empire. This empire was built on the back of slaves. More
specifically, it was built on the back of the gith, a species broadly similar to
humanity.</p>

<p>The gith eventually rose up and gained their freedom by using the tools of their
tentacly oppressors: psychic powers! Once they didn’t have a common enemy to
unite against, the internal tensions of the gith began building up and
eventually exploded. The resulting conflict divided the gith into two people
with radically different philosophies: the xenophobic and militaristic
githyanki, and the contemplative and isolationist githzerai. We’ll focus on the
first here.</p>

<p>The githyanki migrated en masse to the Astral Sea and built their capital city
of Tu’narath on the corpse of a dead god. From there their astral ships sail on
piratical voyages, to juicy targets in the Astral Sea, the world, and perhaps
beyond.</p>

<p>Each ship captain has full discretion on which targets to pick and on how to run
their ship, but all ultimately answer to their lich queen Vlaakith, the supreme
ruler of the githyanki. A githyanki attack might be a simple raid, but it might
also be part of a more complex plan of their queen.</p>

<p>Aside from piracy, those astral ships also seek to find more of those gigantic
astral entity corpses and other such debris on which to build more cities and
expand their empire.</p>

<p>The preferred combat style of the githyanki mixes swordplay and psychic
powers. They wield psionically enchanted silver blades and use telekinesis to
perform impossible leaps and to attack at range with energy blasts. Their
initial publication back in the 1st Edition days probably did a lot to
popularize this “sword &amp; spell warrior” archetype, which is often nicknamed
“gish” in reference to them and is represented by the swordmage class in 4e.</p>

<p>Githyanki sometimes associate with red dragons, likely because both respect
martial prowess and have a hankerin’ for plundered treasure.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Despite living in the Astral Sea, githyanki are Medium Natural Humanoids since
they originated in the world. Their usual speed is 6 but armor may reduce that,
as for PCs.</p>

<p>All githyanki combatants wield a silver sword of some sort, which usually does
psychic damage. They can also perform a <strong>Telekinetic Leap</strong> as a move action
once per encounter, allowing themselves or an ally within 10 squares to fly 5
squares.</p>

<p>Their other psychic powers vary with each individual stat block. The MM versions
also have a +2 to saves against charm effects (meaning “powers with the Charm
keyword”), which is absent from the MV version.</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-warrior-both">Githyanki Warrior (Both)</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 12 Soldier with 118 HP, who wears plate and wields a
silver greatsword. Warriors likely make up the bulk of the crew on those pirate
ships, which would explain why they’re such a terror. The MV version is the best
of the two, so we’ĺl start with that and note the differences later.</p>

<p>That <strong>silver greatsword</strong> does psychic damage on a hit, and does bonus damage
against immobilized targets. As an effect, these basic attacks apply a
double-strenght mark against the target for a turn. This means the target gets a
-4 penalty to attack enemies other than the marking warrior instead of the usual
-2. I believe these are the only monsters to do so.</p>

<p>Warriors can also use a <strong>Telekinetic Grasp</strong> (Ranged 5 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6)
against Medium or smaller targets, doing no damage but immobilizing them (save
ends). Multiple warriors will know to split the tasks of immobilizing the PCs
and hitting them with the sword for that damage bonus.</p>

<p>The MV version is similar, but doesn’t mark with its attacks and the sword does
physical damage (the bonus damage is still psychic).</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-mindslicer-both">Githyanki Mindslicer (Both)</h3>

<p>This one focuses more on its powers than on its sword. It’s level 13 Artillery
with 98 HP. Again we start with the better MV version and note the differences
later.</p>

<p>The mindslicer’s weapon of choice is a <strong>silver longsword</strong>, which does psychic
damage as usual. It has two ranged options. <strong>Mindslice</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will)
does psychic damage at range. The <strong>Psychic Barrage</strong> (Area Burst 1 within 20
vs. Will; Recharge 6) spreads that over a wider area and adds a couple of nasty
riders: ongoing psychic damage and an inability to use daily or encounter powers
(save ends both).</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-raider-mv">Githyanki Raider (MV)</h3>

<p>This lightly-armored combatant is a Level 13 Skirmisher with 126 HP. Its
<strong>silver longsword</strong> deals psychic damage as usual, and it can shift 2 squares
as an effect when it attacks with the blade.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the raider can <strong>Slash and Dash</strong>, making an attack against
one creature, shifting up to its speed, and attacking another target. Each of
those does double the damage of a basic attack, half on a miss. As a move
action, it can shift up to 2 squares.</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-legionnaire-mv">Githyanki Legionnaire (MV)</h3>

<p>A Level 13 Minion Soldier which makes me thing I was wrong when I said the
Warrior above made up the bulk of their crews. This is basically a Minion
version of the warrior, down to its power selection and bonus damage against
immobilized targets.</p>

<h3 id="githyanki-gish-mm">Githyanki Gish (MM)</h3>

<p>This amusingly named fellow is a Level 15 Elite Skirmisher that might represent
a ship captain or officer. It has 226 HP, wears mail and wields a <strong>silver
longsword</strong>.</p>

<p>The basic attack is nothing special, dealing psychic damage with no riders. The
gish can make two of those per action. It can also shoot <strong>Force Bolts</strong> (Ranged
10 vs. Reflex; recharge 6) for a bit of ranged force damage. Once per encounter
it can fire off a <strong>Storm of Stars</strong>, performing four attacks (Ranged 5 vs. AC)
and dealing fire damage on those it hits.</p>

<p>The usual Telekinetic Leap is replaced by Astral Stride, an at-will move action
that allows the gish to teleport 6 squares and gain both insubstantial and
phasing for a turn. Yikes, I can see why this one didn’t make it into the
MV. It’s a bit too annoyingly hard to pin down.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>The MM gives us three:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 12: 3 githyanki warriors and 2 redspawn firebelchers. Add them to the
list of people who do dragonspawn ranching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 4 warriors and 2 mindslicers. Your standard pirate squad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 3 warriors, 1 mindslicer, 1 gish and 1 nightmare. A captain and
their bodyguards plus a mount.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Replacing the nightmare in that third one with an adult red dragon turns it into
a level 19 encounter. Using a reskinned chimera instead makes it
level 17. Y’know, just in case you want to have some fun with your players.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Githyanki are pirates who fight like Jedi, which makes them awesome in my book!
A campaign centered on planar travel is well-served by their addition. Even if
that’s not a major theme, a sudden githyanki raid can make a nice random
encounter, or an unwelcome complication for an otherwise unrelated crisis.</p>

            <p>This article is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Gibbering beasts used to be several different monster entries that originally
appeared throughout AD&amp;D and 3.x in different places. Here they were quite
sensibly collected together. They appear only on the Monster Manual, but
received an MV-style update in Dungeon #192, so we’ll look at them there too.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>A gibbering beast is a slimy, amorphous, oozelike creature covered in eyes and
mouths. And eyes with mouths. And mouths with eyes. And eyes inside mouths. And
is that a bunch of teeth just kinda sprouting from that quivering protuberance?</p>

<p>They crawl or float around, looking every which way with their eyes and
constantly spouting nonsense from their mouths, which they also use to attack
and eat other creatures. The nonsense can be just as dangerous as the bites, as
it warps the minds of those who hear it and makes them easy prey for the
beast.</p>

<p>The lesser varieties of gibbering beast spontaneously generate when something
dies in places touched by the influence of the Far Realm, which causes the
corpse’s face to detach and become a newborn beast. Over time they can grow and
become both smarter and more powerful. Sometimes the strongest varieties travel
directly from the Far Realm to the world, bent on enacting some insane scheme of
their own.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Gibbering beasts are Aberrant Magical Beasts, and they all have All-Around
Vision and Darkvision. Creatures with All-Around Vision can’t be flanked, which
makes it a lot harder to get combat advantage against them.</p>

<p>Their other signature trait is their incessant <strong>Gibbering</strong>, a free action that
happens at the start of their turns: Close Burst 5 vs. Will, a hit dazes the
targets for a turn. Deafened creatures are immune to this.</p>

<p>All Gibbering Beasts are Unaligned, which is very appropriate for truly alien
aberrant entities.</p>

<h3 id="gibbering-mouther">Gibbering Mouther</h3>

<figure class="left">

</figure>

<p>The weakest and most classic among these entries, the gibbering mouther is
Medium and a Level 10 Controller with 110 HP. It moves at speed 5 on land, and
can swim at the same speed. Its mere presence warps the space around it, which
works as an Aura 3 that acts as difficult terrain against enemies.</p>

<p>The mouther’s basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> that deals physical damage and ongoing
5 acid damage (save ends). Its <strong>Gibbering</strong> works as described above, and opens
the way for <strong>Gibbering Feast</strong> (Close Burst 5), a power which causes unnatural
mouths to appear on any dazed creatures in the area and perform a basic bite
attack against them. Now <em>that’s</em> an aberrant creature! “Your left hand grows a
mouth and tries to eat your face” is top-notch horror imagery.</p>

<p>Gibbering mouthers have Int 4, and are sapient enough to work with other
aberrant or even non-aberrant creatures if they see advantage in doing so. The
Dungeon update is identical aside from the fixed damage numbers and the lack of
the Gibbering Feast’s colorful description.</p>

<h3 id="gibbering-abomination">Gibbering Abomination</h3>

<figure class="right">

</figure>

<p>A bigger mouther. It’s still Medium, but it’s a Level 18 Controller with 168
HP. It’s faster and trades some buoyancy for flight, with a land speed of 6 and
a flight speed of 4 (hover, maximum altitude 1).</p>

<p>Its <strong>Unnatural Utterances</strong> work as an Aura 5 that inflicts a -2 attack penalty
on any enemies caught within. They periodically increase in intensity to perform
the standard <strong>Gibbering</strong> attack.</p>

<p>The abomination’s basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Tentacle</strong> that does immediate
physical and ongoing psychic damage (save ends). It can also stare at you really
hard with the <strong>Eye of Despair</strong> (Ranged 10 vs. Will; Recharge 3-6), which does
psychic damage and immobilizes (save ends).</p>

<p>The gibbering abomination does extra “sneak attack” damage against creatures it
has combat advantage against, but it sadly lacks an extra-creepy ability like
Gibbering Feast. It does have Int 11, meaning it will make more complex (though
no less insane) plans than the mouther. The Dungeon update simply fixes its
damage totals.</p>

<p>This Huge Level 27 Solo Controller has 1230 HP and has arrived directly from the
Far Realm to do Cthulhu-knows-what. With its Int 17, it’s capable of hatching
elaborate schemes. Given that it has a whole suite of <em>eye rays</em>, it might give
you an idea of what beholders were like before migrating to the world and being
mutated by the trip. It flies at speed 8 (hover).</p>

<p>The orb’s <strong>Merciless Eyes</strong> work like an Aura 5; anyone who starts their turn
inside and visible gets targetted by a random eye ray.</p>

<p>The orb’s basic bite attack does damage and causes the mouth that made it to
detach and automatically attack the target again at the start of the orb’s
subsequent turns! This lasts until the mouth misses with an attack, at which
point it falls off and rots.</p>

<p>The Gibbering works as for the other monsters, but is a Close Burst 10.</p>

<p>The orb can also spend its standard action to make two different eye ray attacks
in addition to any automatic ones from Merciless Eyes. The orb can choose which
rays it uses when it does this, from the following selection:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Mindcarving</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Will; psychic damage and daze (save ends).</li>
  <li><strong>Fleshtearing</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Fort; necrotic damage and ongoing
necrotic damage (save ends).</li>
  <li><strong>Bonewarping</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Fort; physical damage and weakness (save
ends).</li>
  <li><strong>Bloodfeasting</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Reflex; physical damage and ongoing physical
damave (save ends).</li>
  <li><strong>Farsending</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Reflex; transported to the Far Realm for a turn; on
return, takes psychic damage and suffers a -5 penalty to attacks until the
end of the encounter.</li>
  <li><strong>Souleating</strong>: Ranged 10 vs. Will; slows (save ends); worsens to immobilization
on first failed save; target dies on second failed save.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s a pretty fearsome selection, and the names do a lot to evoke that body
horror feeling. It’s less varied than the rays available to a Beholder Eye
Tyrant, but every ray does damage, there’s two different ongoing damage effects
that can stack with each other and a daze to catch people the <strong>Gibbering</strong>
misses.</p>

<p>The farsending ray is also pretty brutal, since it instantly removes a character
from play for the whole next turn and saddles then with a long-lasting attack
penalty. Not <em>quite</em> as bad as death, but worse than a stun effect. And of
course there’s a gradual death effect.</p>

<p>Gibbering Orbs are boss battle material for a level 23 or 24 party, and with a
bit of leveling could be promoted to the “campaign end boss” role as one of
those Outer Gods that orbit Azathoth or the equivalent.</p>

<p>The Dungeon update reduces their HP to 984, and the radius of its Gibbering to
the standard 5 squares. It also fixes its damage, increasing it considerably.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>Gibbering beasts go well with any other aberrant or aberrant-adjacent creature
(like cultists and such). Even the gibbering mouther knows the value of
cooperation, and they certainly might be bullied into service by more powerful
monsters.</p>

<p>Unlike the other, lesser beasts, gibbering orbs prefer to work alone and don’t
seek out alliances. However, their presence generates spontaneous phenomena and
attracts creatures that end up effectively acting as its heralds and harbingers.</p>

<p>The sample encounters in the book are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 2 gibbering mouthers, 1 foulspawn seer, 2 foulspawn berserkers, and
1 chuul.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 18: 1 gibbering abomination, 2 nabassu gargoyles, 1 aboleth lasher and 2
kuo-toa guards.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>One constant theme in the comments I’ve been getting in these entries are that
few of the aberrant monsters seen so far seem worthy of that origin, being far
less alien than what someone would expect from the Far Realm.</p>

<p>I feel that if there’s one family of monsters worthy of the “Aberrant” title,
it’s the gibbering beasts. The Gibbering Orb is awesome in that role, and the
“basic” Gibbering Mouther is actually better at evoking horror than the
abomination, with its “your body grows mouths and tries to eat itself” attack.</p>

<p>Storm giants are another classic giant type, present since at least the days of
AD&amp;D. In Fourth Edition they seem to have been merged with cloud giants, which
used to be quite close in power to them and differed mostly on alignment. Both
seem to have been inspired by the giant from Jack and the Beanstalk. They’re
present only in the MM.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Back at the dawn of time, storm titans and giants were the favored servants of
the primordials, and were given command over the rest of their kind. In the
present day there’s no unified giant society for them to rule, but storm giants
are still closer to what they were at the height of their power than the other
giants. They’re as much at home underwater or flying through the sky as they are
on land.</p>

<p>I imagine that, unlike the other classic giants, these don’t usually raid or
invade nearby mortal settlements. The domains of a storm giant would already be
well-established and be located very far away from any “mundane”
locations. That’s not to say they’re <em>pleasant</em> places for anyone but the giants
themselves, at least not necessarily.</p>

<p>Storm giants build (or command their servants to build) marvelous castles in
places mortals can’t usually reach, like the bottom of the sea or islands
floating above the clouds. They might settle for the top of a tall mountain if
they want to slum it. In these lordly palaces they keep all sorts of fantastical
treasures.</p>

<p>When storm giants feel a need to make war, they summon enormous storms upon
which their armies ride to battle. These are known as Harbinger Storms, and are
likely one of the most sure omens that whoever they rain upon is fucked.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Storm giants and titans are Large and Huge Elemental Humanoids,
respectively. They have the Aquatic and Giant keywords. They have resistance to
lightning and thunder, along with both swim and fly speeds. They also have
command of lightning and storms, being surrounded by mini-storms in combat.</p>

<p>These giants are quite sophisticated and intelligent, having a typical Int
of 14. The ones presented here are Evil as befits the beanstalk giant, though
you could certainly make a case for less nasty individuals in your stories.</p>

<h3 id="storm-giant">Storm Giant</h3>

<p>This is a Level 24 Controller with 228 HP. Its elemental resistances are set to
15; it runs and swims at speed 8, and flies at speed 10. In combat it surrounds
itself with a small storm that acts as an Aura 2, inflicting 10 lightning and
thunder damage to anyone caught inside, and preventing them from flying unless
they’re other storm giants/titans.</p>

<p>The storm giant wields a Crackling Greatsword in combat (Reach 2 vs. AC) which
does a mix of physical and lightning damage. The giant can sweep the sword in a
wide arc (Close Burst 2 vs. AC; Recharge 6), damaging everyone it hits. It can
also hurl thunderbolts (Ranged 10 vs. Reflex) for lightning and thunder
damage. In addition to doing damage, they also push the target 3 squares and
daze them (save ends) on a hit.</p>

<p>Finally, it can temporarily intensify its storm aura into a burst of Howling
Winds (Close Burst 4 vs. Fortidude; Recharge 5-6) which does thunder damage,
pushes 4 squares, and knocks prone on a hit. On a miss, this still does half
damage and pushes 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="storm-titan">Storm Titan</h3>

<p>The Storm Titan is a Level 27 Elite Controller with 506 HP, and is basically a
beefed-up storm giant in all respects. Its Huge in size, with the same movement
speeds and modes. Its resistances are doubled to 30 as is the radius of its
storm aura.</p>

<p>The titan has exact the same attacks as the giant, with melee Reach 3 where
appropriate and increased accuracy and damage based on level. As an elite
monster it can also perform two greatsword attacks per action.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The MM gives us one sample encounter: Level 27, 1 storm titan, 1 thunderblast
cyclone elemental, 2 storm gorgons. You can likely expect similarly themed
elementals and blue dragons to make up the retinues of other storm giants and
titans.</p>

<p>I like them, particularly due to the Jack and the Beanstalk associations. I
don’t mind losing cloud giants in the conversion to 4e. It seems fitting that
the giant you find atop the cloud is the one that wants to grind your bones for
seasoning, not invite you to dinner. And if you really want to you could bring
the good sky giants back using these same stats.</p>

<p>I also don’t mind that the storm giant and titan share similar abilities -
conceptually, their set is fairly solid. The main problem here is that both
suffer from the fairly severe form of the damage bug that afflicts epic-level
creatures. You should definitely fix that before using them in your adventures.</p>

<p>Death Giants are a 3.x creation, first appearing in one of that edition’s
Monster Manual 2 or 3. For 4e, they get a new backstory. They appear only on the
Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Back at the dawn of creation when the titans were exploring the world, some of
them found their way to the Shadowfell and liked the place so much they moved
there permanently along with their giant children and allowed the energies of
the place to permeate their beings. And that’s how the first death titans and
giants came to be.</p>

<p>These giants have entirely abandoned their elemental nature and their allegiance
to the primordials, and are now fully creatures of the Shadowfell. They’re
probably also the world’s biggest fans of death metal. Though they stick mostly
to their native plane, they will sometimes live in the world in places like
graveyards and necropoli where the wall between the two planes is thin.</p>

<p>Death giants derive their power and sustenance from the souls of living
creatures. They don’t need to consume souls very often, but they still enjoy
hunting for sport and most of them are surrounded by a shroud of trapped,
wailing spirits waiting their turn to be lunch.</p>

<p>They’re fairly intelligent, but my impression is they’re not too fond of banding
together in large groups. They frequently associate with undead or with
necromantic cults that like performing sacrifices. The latter provide a steady
source of nutrition, since a death giant doesn’t need to personally kill someone
to trap their soul - the victim just has to die near the giant.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Death giants and titans are Large and Huge Shadow Humanoids with the Giant
keyword. They have Darkvision, resistance to necrotic damage, and an Aura 5 that
captures the soul of anyone who dies in range. They can spend these captured
souls to power some of their abilities. Their typical Int score is 12, making
them the smartest giants we’ve seen so far, and their alignment is Evil.</p>

<p>We get two stat blocks here, one for the giant and one for the titan, but you
can use the guidelines above to make your own.</p>

<h3 id="death-giant">Death Giant</h3>

<p>This is a Level 22 Brute with 255 HP. It has Resist 15 Necrotic and a speed
of 7. It wears mail and wields a greataxe.</p>

<p>The greataxe is Reach 2 and does physical damage with he High Crit property,
suffering from the damage bug. The giant’s most distinctive powers come from its
soul shroud.</p>

<p>Anyone who dies within 5 squares of a death giant adds one soul shard to its
shroud. No detail on whether this “shard” is a whole soul or a literal shard of
one. If it’s the latter, then a single death might add shards to multiple giants
if their auras overlap.</p>

<p>In any case, you can assume a death giant starts the fight with 4 shards in its
shroud unless your story demands otherwise. It can consume one shard to heal 20
HP, or spend it to power a Soulfire Burst (Close Burst 1 vs. Reflex) that does
necrotic damage and could <em>really</em> use a damage fix. If the giant’s shroud ever
runs out of shards, it takes a -2 penalty to its attacks until it can add more.</p>

<p>Since a being has to <em>die</em> to add a shard to the giant’s shroud, I think it’s
one of those monsters that has an incentive to finish off downed PCs. It also
pairs really well with minions, and you might also want to add some minion-like
innocent victims in your battlefield that the PCs would have an extra incentive
to protect.</p>

<h3 id="death-titan">Death Titan</h3>

<p>This is a Level 25 Elite Brute with 574 HP. Its aura works the same as that of
the death giant, and also inflicts a -2 penalty to the attacks of any enemies
within. Its necrotic resistance is 30, and its speed is 8.</p>

<p>Death titans wear plate and fight with Huge greataxes, which are Reach 3 and
have the High Crit property. They can attack twice per action with these axes.</p>

<p>The death titan’s soul shroud works the same way as that of the giant, but the
titan doesn’t need to wait for people to die around it! It has an ability called
Soul Devourer (Ranged 5 vs. Fortitude), which takes a bite off the soul of an
enemy, causing it to lose a healing surge and adding one soul shard to the
titan’s shroud. An excellent power to use from a distance while the titan’s
buddies engage in melee.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter in the MM is level 24: 1 death titan, 2 death giants, 1
voidsoul specter and 1 deathpriest hierophant.</p>

<p>IIRC, the deathpriest hierophant is tied to Orcus, the demon lord of undeath
(we’ll get to him in time). So perhaps you could say that in your campaign,
death giants were originally created by the primordial who became Orcus, and
that their transformation happened at the same time as that of their master.</p>
