          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/08/25/neverwinter-blacklake.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: Blacklake District</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The Blacklake district, named after the lake located here, was where most nobles
of Neverwinter used to live. Pretty much all of them died in the fires of the
cataclysm, but their very sturdy and well-built residences remained
standing. They sheltered many of the city’s survivors during the following
decades, even though the lake became a fetid, ash-choked pool.</p>

<p>Today, Blacklake is a rough-and-tumble place still largely outside of
Neverember’s control. His forces have begun moving in and attempting to extend
the Enclave to the district, but so far they have not met much success. This is,
after all, where everyone who can’t stand his harsh rule lives.</p>

<p>Castle Never is located in Blacklake, and we will cover it in its own post.</p>

<h2 id="the-driftwood-tavern">The Driftwood Tavern</h2>

<p>The place where everybody knows your name. The Driftwood tavern has been open
since before the Cataclysm. Its owner, Madame Rosene, opened the tavern’s doors
to shelter refugees in the event’s immediate aftermath, and it became a kind of
makeshift city hall for the survivor community in the following years.</p>

<p>Today, the Madame is in her fifties and the tavern is filled with mementos and
relics of Neverwinter That Was, making it a sort of museum. Both the place’s
somber atmosphere and its high prices keep the Mintarn mercs at bay - the only
customers are long-time regulars and old friends.</p>

<p>This suits Madame Rosene just fine, because the Driftwood Tavern is also the
main headquarters of the Greycloaks faction of the Sons of Alagondar, which she
leads.</p>

<p>A text box says that Madame Rosene would react positively to PCs who can
recognize the historical and sentimental value of the Neverwinter relics that
decorate her tavern, and that she might test their patience and resolve by
sending them on seemingly pointless quests to recover more.</p>

<h2 id="the-beached-leviathan">The Beached Leviathan</h2>

<p>This tavern is actually built out of an old pirate ship that ran aground decades
ago. Its owner Harrag was also the boat’s former captain. He presents himself as
an adventuresome scallywag but the truth is Neverember owns him. Anything people
say within earshot of him eventually makes its way to the lord.</p>

<p>The tavern also acts as the current residence of Len-Jes, a watersoul genasi who
works as Neverember’s harbormaster. Her job includes keeping track of (and
taxing) every ship at port, and also dredging the bay to open more berths for
trade ships.</p>

<p>Len-Jes only took this job because if facilitates her second, much shadier
source of income. The exact nature of that is up to the GM. Is she a spy for an
Abeir trade house or pirate crew? Does she have buried treasure somewhere? Does
she actually work for some other faction like the Harpers or the Ashmadai?</p>

<h2 id="vellgard-manor">Vellgard Manor</h2>

<p>Mordai Vell’s family home. They used to be a prominent Neverwinter noble family
but they all died in the Cataclysm. Mordai Vell was the only survivor because,
as a tiefling, he was a source of shame and was sent away from town. As the sole
heir, he came back to reclaim his home shortly before Neverember arrived… and
he brought his Ashmadai buddies with him.</p>

<p>Vell’s charisma and wealth soon secured him an informal community leadership
role in the district, and there are those who think he’d make a fine lord of the
city. I don’t think he ever made overt claims to the throne, but perhaps he will
when his cult is in a strong enough position.</p>

<p>Vellgard Manor is very well fortified, and guarded by a small army of cultists
and summoned devils. A direct assault would be difficult… but Vell likes to
party, so the PCs might get in by arranging invitations to his latest social
function. The devils are kept hidden during these. Of course, Vell is no fool,
so he might allow the PCs to get in and spring a trap on them if they’re not
subtle in their maneuvering.</p>

<h2 id="house-of-a-thousand-faces">House of a Thousand Faces</h2>

<p>This tavern used to be a fancy boutique, and it’s still decorated with
mannequins in old-fashioned clothing. It closed after the cataclysm and reopened
as a tavern when the city’s population began to recover.</p>

<p>Its owner, the elf Theryis, is a member of the Harpers. Her brother Toram took
over as the leader of the group once Cymril died. As mentioned elsewhere, these
two are the sole remaining full Harpers in the city, and they aren’t predisposed
to trust the PCs just because they’re PCs. Their default stance is to watch and
test them until they prove themselves properly heroic, or until they bring
evidence of the larger factions.</p>

<p>Toram, however, will attack the Harper Agent on sight because he’s convinced
they were responsible for Cymril’s death. He was in love with her, you
see… or, as the book puts it, <em>she was seducing him before her supposed
death</em>. Make of that what you will.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>All those secret society HQs gathered up in one convenient neighborhood! In most
campaigns the PCs are guaranteed to end up visiting one or more of them, either
to talk to its owners or to raid them.</p>

<p>Blacklake is not quite the “bad” part of town, but it definitely has a different
atmosphere from the Enclave. I’d portray it with a more “frontier” feeling -
it’s a bit more dangerous and run-down, but also more free, and the residents’
opinion of Neverember is significantly worse even when they aren’t involved in
organized resistance against him.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Neverwinter is a coastal city-state built at the mouth of a river. There are
several stories about how it got that name, but the most popular one is that it
was from the warm waters of that river, which prevent the delta from freezing
during winter and so keep its port viable year-round.</p>

<p>Comparing the book and the computer games, I see present-day inhabitants of
Neverwinter have a somewhat romanticized view of Nasher Alagondar, the former
adventurer who ruled the city about 150 years before this campaign starts. He
was an effective ruler, though, and his descendants formed a dynasty that
remained unbroken until the cataclysm 27 years ago, when the last of them died
or vanished.</p>

<p>The cataclysm wrecked the city, opening a huge chasm that destroyed its
southeastern quadrant and began to vomit forth mutated monstrosities. Most of
the citizens who didn’t die left as refugees, and only a minority of holdouts
decided to stay and protect their ancestral homes. They built a makeshift wall
to isolate the Chasm and its monsters from the rest of the city, and soon began
to see its defense as a sacred duty.</p>

<p>Lord Neverember arrived nearly ten years ago at the head of an army of
carpenters and builders, protected by a mercenary force from Mintarn. Around
five years ago he established the Protector’s Enclave, a sort of “green zone”
taking up the southwestern quadrant of the city, which he declared safe for
occupation. There were already people living all over the city, but the
establishment of the Enclave opened the way for refugees to return and for new
immigrants to come seeking opportunities.</p>

<p>The people of Neverwinter, then, can be split into two demographic groups: the
“holdouts” who never left the city, and the “newcomers” who arrived or returned
after Neverember declared it once again open for business.</p>

<h2 id="the-enclave">The Enclave</h2>

<p>The Enclave’s infrastructure has been restored to pre-cataclysm levels, more or
less. This includes the port, which has once again begun to see trade from
Waterdeep and elsewhere. The variety of goods in its markets does a lot to make
life in Neverwinter easier.</p>

<p>Not all is roses in the Enclave, though. Neverember’s government imposes a steep
tax on all commercial transactions, and the place is heavily policed by those
Mintarn mercenaries. The taxes are something one can get used to, but those
mercs have spies and goons stationed everywhere and love to employ all sorts of
excessive force against any perceived sign of dissent.</p>

<p>Neverember doesn’t personally care about this police brutality, but he does make
an effort to keep it at a level that’s beneath his notice, occasionally blaming
and punishing one of his underlings to get things to simmer back down for a
while.</p>

<p>There’s discontent aimed at Neverember from a lot of sides. The holdout
population dislikes him because he’s taking credit for much of their work, and
sidelining them in his new government. The newcomers see him in a better light
but still dislike the heavy taxes and oppressive mercs. Those who like him
usually also like the whole New Neverwinter rhetoric and say the harsh measures
and heavy taxes are needed to keep the city’s restoration going.</p>

<p>The Sons of Alagondar in particular see him as a foreign occupier and call him
Lord Pretender. If your PCs want to brawl with a guard patrol, saying those
words within earshot of them is the best way to do so.</p>

<p>Neverember’s current headquarters is at the Hall of Justice, the former temple
of Tyr. If you played the first Neverwinter Nights game you might recognize this
as your quest hub during Act 1. Tyr died in the Spellplague, but the citizens
refused to convert the temple to worship of another god. Neverember had it
restored and sponsors a group Torm priests that perform rituals following the
old Tyrran tradition in here. While many people see this move in a positive
light, the Sons of Alagondar claim Neverember’s presence defiles the temple and
call it the “Hall of Never-Justice”.</p>

<h3 id="the-moonstone-and-other-earthmotes">The Moonstone and Other Earthmotes</h3>

<p>There are three earthmotes in Neverwinter. These were created by the
Spellplague, and became fixtures in the city’s skyline long before the
eruption.</p>

<p>The first as the Moonstone, so called because it’s the current site of the
Moonstone Mask. Another familiar location from the computer games, this fancy
inn fell on hard times and shut its doors after the cataclysm. About five years
ago it reopened under new management, with some financial help from
Neveremeber. Liset Cheldar, the current owner, repays him by housing a large
number of Mintarn mercenaries in her establishment. They take up most rooms and
a bunch of them can be found there at all hours, dragging the atmosphere down
and picking fights with non-merc patrons. The Moonstone is lashed to the docks
with heavy chains, and connected by a bridge.</p>

<p>The book suggests making Liset the puppet of one of the other factions, but I
think that’s a bit too cliche to make the pretty and flirty woman a secret
monster. The inn is already dangerous enough with all the mercs in it.</p>

<p>The southernmost earthmote is called Fisher’s Float, and it’s home and workplace
to a small community of fishers that have lived there since before the
cataclysm. Their catch provides a great deal of food to the city, though their
isolated location often gives rise to rumors of sinister goings-on. They’re just
rumors unless the GM decides otherwise.</p>

<p>The mote that flies the highest and furthest from town is the Pirate’s
Skyhold. A gang of sky pirates used it as a base because it’s impossible to
reach without flight. One night, though, the pirates apparently all killed each
other in a frenzy of betrayal, leaving the island deserted. Their skyship, and
all of their treasure, are rumored to have stayed there intact - though other
rumors say that a dragon made the island its lair after a while. You can still
see the ruins of wooden buildings poking out of this island’s forested slopes,
but it remains inaccessible to most. The GM is explicitly encouraged to make
this place into a cool aerial dungeon of their own design.</p>

<h3 id="the-wall">The Wall</h3>

<p>The Wall was built by Neverwinter’s holdouts after the cataclysm. It separates
the southwestern quadrant of the city from the Chasm in the SE quadrant. It was
initially built from rubble and barricaded buildings, and manned by
martially-inclined survivors. Neverember reinforced it with proper defensive
architecture and assigned a significant chunk of his mercenaries to supplement
the survivor garrison. Those survivors still guard the Wall alongside the mercs,
because they see it as their sacred duty.</p>

<p>Together with Neverwinter River, the Wall has been effective at preventing any
plaguechanged horrors from leaving the area of the Chasm, but recently some of
them have been spotted north of the river and near sewer entrances. Mayor Galt
fields several daily petitions for expanding the Wall further.</p>

<p>Guarding the Wall and repelling plaguechanged assaults is one of the quickest
ways to win the hearts and minds of the city’s inhabitants. The increasing
friction between the mercs who make up most of the guard forces and the hardened
native veterans who refuse to abandon their posts can also be a source of many
plot hooks.</p>

<h3 id="the-house-of-knowledge">The House of Knowledge</h3>

<p>This used to be a great temple to Oghma, occupying what is now the northeast end
of the Wall. After the cataclysm, the elderly Brother Anthus became its head
priest for a while, and they dedicated themselves to studying the plaguechanged
creatures that emerged from it. When Anthus died under mysterious circumstances,
the priestess Rohini took over and moved their whole operation to Helm’s Hold.</p>

<p>(To know the truth about those mysterious circumstances, check Rohini’s bio).</p>

<p>A single volunteer priest remained behind to look after the temple’s extensive
library and archive, Brother Atlavast. Long years of solitude and isolation have
made the priest a paranoid eccentric. He keeps to the lower levels underground
and I don’t think a lot of people even remember he’s there.</p>

<p>By default, Atlavast is ornery but not evil. He’ll be very happy to see Oghma’s
Faithful, for example, though he will insist on testing them and any other PCs
to see if they’re worthy of the archives. If they do manage to befriend him, he
can be a great help when exploring the library. Optionally, he might be in
thrall to the aboleths (like the rest of the priests over at Helm’s Hold), and
must be freed before he can become an ally.</p>

<p>The surface levels of the temple, long abandoned, have been taken over by a
group of squatters which decided to make themselves useful by serving as
lookouts on the Wall and ringing the temple’s bells when they see monsters. The
mercs often leave them gifts of food and clothing, and are becoming fast friends
with them… unaware that the squatters are all undercover Ashmadai
cultists. They already managed to get one of the Mintarn captains possessed by a
devil.</p>

<h3 id="neverdeath">Neverdeath</h3>

<p>This huge graveyard was in use for centuries until the cataclysm, when the vast
expanse of graves and mausoleums was wracked by tremors. Some sections of it
sunk, others rose up, and these convulsions exposed graves and underground
crypts, causing coffins and bones to tumble about the whole area.</p>

<p>The current inhabitants of the city fear this place. The Mintarn mercs burn dead
bodies outside the city walls instead of burying them here. It’s not uncommon
for unburied bodies on or near the cemetery to rise as undead of their own
accord.</p>

<p>It doesn’t help that the Thayans have a major secret base in here, and are using
it as their main source of bodies for reanimation. The place also contains a
shadow crossing into Evernight, and Valindra has built a teleportation circle
here to make use of it.</p>

<p>The Netherese are aware of the shadow crossing and one of their goals is to
destroy it or otherwise deny it to Valindra. They want to be discreet about it,
though, and don’t want to jeopardize their project to raise Xinlenal.</p>

<h3 id="waterclock-crypts">Waterclock Crypts</h3>

<p>Neverwinter was once known for the amazing quality of its water clocks. The
guild responsible for making them built this crypt to inter its dead. Located
somewhere inside Neverdeath, it’s filled with clever traps and engines built
using hydraulics and elemental magic. Hidden here is the laboratory of its
founder, who first arrived in the city coming from Luskan with a cartload of
stolen magic knowledge. Its library contains all of that knowledge and more,
including notes on the original ritual that bound Maegera.</p>

<p>An underground vein of elemental magic that links Luskan and Gauntlgrym passes
through the crypt - it’s why the founder’s lab was built here. Following the
vein could be one way in which the PCs find the lost city. Of course, they need
to get through all the undead and Thayans up above, as well as whatever defenses
this place has.</p>

<h3 id="the-docks">The Docks</h3>

<p>Rebuilding the docks was one of Neverember’s greatest priorities. While there’s
still plenty of work to be done here, the docks are already functional and able
to receive ships. Trade with the rest of the world has resumed, and the lord
makes a pretty penny charging tariffs on its cargo. There’s lots of crime and
corruption here as well, but I get the feeling Neverember only cares about it to
the extend that it impedes trade.</p>

<p>Also here is the Tarmalune Trade House, belonging to a merchant guild from
Returned Abeir (the new continent a ways off to the west of Neverwinter). In
what might be an unexpected development, they’re just a normal trading house who
can offer supplies and filler quests to our protagonists. Their goal is entirely
mundane: to form commercial ties with the very lucrative markets at
Waterdeep. They’ll be extra-friendly towards any PCs that have ties to the
nobility of that city, like the Neverwinter Noble or the Devil’s Pawn.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Even though this is the “safe” part of town there are still quite a few sources
of danger in it. A lot of that danger comes from the mercs, who will mercilessly
harass anyone who looks like they might start trouble, a description that fits
most PCs. Neverdeath will be a major location in any campaign focused on either
the Thayans or on Gauntlgrym.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In this post, we’ll cover the minor factions that are located underground, in
and near the ruins of Gauntlgrym.</p>

<p>This dwarven city was a major metropolis in its heyday, and the capital of the
dwarven empire of Delzoun. Its underground location allowed it to survive the
fall of Netheril mostly unscathed, but it would fall to an orcish invasion a
couple of centuries later.</p>

<p>The original inhabitants of Gauntlgrym either perished in this attack or fled to
the surface, and the location of the city was lost to them after a few
generations. The history of the city did not end there, however, as passed
through the hands of several Underdark factions over time. It’s also still
inhabited by the ghosts of the dead.</p>

<p>This means our encounter table here is mostly undead. While some dwarven ghosts
might be helpful to their descendants, most of the undead here are of the usual
mindlessly murderous variety. The table contains several skeletons, zombies,
ghouls, wraiths, ghosts, and even mummies. It also has dire corbies.</p>

<h2 id="dire-corbies">Dire Corbies</h2>

<p>These critters look like buff skeksis, and are given the same header style as
actual Gauntlgrym factions, but they’re not really organized enough to be called
that. This is mostly a “new monster” entry. Looks like they made their debut in
a Gauntlgrym-focused post in Dungeon 183.</p>

<p>This entry says they’re descended from predatory birds who were lost and trapped
in the Underdark a long time ago. The evolutionary pressure and uncanny
radiation of the Underdark changed them into these monstrous humanoids. Their
wings have been changed into powerful clawed arms, and their coal-black feathers
blend into the darkness. They’re predatory and ravenous, pulling themselves
through narrow underground tunnels and viciously attacking anything that looks
even remotely edible.</p>

<p>Dire Corbies are Medium Natural Humanoids and Level 7 Brutes with 96 HP. They
attack with <strong>Gashing Beaks</strong> that do immediate and ongoing damage, and when
first bloodied emit a <strong>Rending Screech</strong> that covers a Close Burst 2, deals
psychic damage, and inflicts Vulnerable 5 to Everything for a turn. A miss does
half damage with no riders.</p>

<p>Since they’re classified as Humanoids and have an Int of 11, it might be
possible that they could form more complex communities and interact with PCs in
non-violent ways… but as written the typical dire corby is Chaotic Evil and an
enthusiastic cannibal. Even if they weren’t, the stronger factions are fond of
enslaving them, so the PCs would still end up fighting dire corbies when facing
those groups.</p>

<h2 id="mind-flayers">Mind Flayers</h2>

<p>The orcs that invaded Gauntlgrym were eventually conquered by mind
flayers. Those mind flayers ruled for a while, conducting an extended experiment
on illithid-derro hybridization, but that got out of control and the resulting
creatures kicked them out.</p>

<p>When the primordial Maegera woke up for a brief time thirty years ago, the
resulting shakeup in Gauntlgrym allowed a new mind flayer colony to move in. I
guess they initially wanted to reclaim their old haunts, but shortly after
arriving their Elder Brain was targeted by the Abolethic Sovereignity’s Symphony
of Madness and infected with the Spellplague. Now the brain and its colony are
completely under AbSov control.</p>

<p>The mind flayers are researching the bound primordial on behalf of their
masters, and also act to protect it from meddlers and would-be conquerors. As
the aboleths funnel more and more Spellplague radiation to them, both the Elder
Brain and its subordinate illithids are becoming more mutated. The brain knows
what’s going on, but it’s become addicted to these energies and will keep
obeying the aboleths in exchange for its regular fix. The individual mind
flayers’ perceptions are clouded, however. They believe all is business as
usual and are incapable of perceiving their own mutations or discovering their
elder brain is working for someone else.</p>

<p>We get stats here for a <strong>Plaguechanged Mind Flayer</strong> (Level 8 Controller) and
the <strong>Plaguechanged Elder Brain</strong> (Level 9 Elite Controller). They work a lot
like their baseline versions, adjusted to Heroic Tier. The illithid is of the
type that can perform thrall surgery on PCs instead of eating their brains. The
brain is mostly immobile (unlike its nimble base version) but has the usual
assortment of psychic attacks and an aura (3) that can strip resistance to
psychic damage. It can also use an interrupt to redirect forced movement effects
back to the enemy who tried to impose them.</p>

<h2 id="duergar">Duergar</h2>

<p>These duergar are relatively recent arrivals to Gauntlgrym. Led by an unholy
warrior of Asmodeus named Kholzourl the Fire-Speaker, they have come here under
orders from their diabolical master. They’ve occupied a section of the ruined
city and resumed some of its ancient and abandoned mining operations. They’ve
enslaved dire corbies and other nearby sapients to work for them, but fear the
ghosts and undead that plague other areas of the ruins.</p>

<p>Only Kholzourl knows the expedition’s real goal, which is actually left for the
GM to determine (the book gives several options later). Regardless of that true
goal, they have been profiting from the ores extracted from the Delzoun mines,
which include iron, mithral, and a metal known as Hellthorn which takes
remarkably well to enchantments based on infernal magic.</p>

<p>The duergar and Ashmadai do not know about each other, and despite serving the
same masters the two factions have no inherent inclination to cooperate unless
directly ordered to do so by a devil emissary of Asmodeus. The default reaction
of the duergar to outsiders is “kill or enslave on sight”: they’re not here to
do diplomacy.</p>

<p>There is one notable exception here: a duergar named Nimor Ironvoice found a
tunnel leading from Gauntlgrym to the surface. He disguised himself, explored a
bit, and found out about the Ashmadai. Now he has a profitable side gig
smuggling small quantities of hellthorn up the well and selling it to the
cult. He knows Kholzourl would punish him if he found out, and soon he will have
to decide between severing his ties to the surface or turning against his fellow
duergar. He’s hoping an infernal sign will tell him the way before either his
boss or Mordai Vell discover the truth by themselves.</p>

<p>The duergar get their own encounter table, which as expected is mostly made up
of duergar from the MM2 and Monster Vault. Kholzourl gets a stat block, which is
fairly typical aside from being level 9. We also get stats for Steeders, the
disgusting devil-spider-things these duergar use as mounts; and for Hellthorn
weapons, which start at Level 10/+2, do immediate and ongoing fire damage on a
critical, increase your fire resistance if you have any, and can let an allied
devil make a free attack once per encounter when you miss one of your own
attacks.</p>

<h2 id="house-xorlarrin">House Xorlarrin</h2>

<p>This Forgotten Realms drow house is said to be “atypical” because its matriarch
is less authoritarian than the others and even occasionally asks for input from
male advisors. But it also has a full-on eugenics program where males are “bred
for magical ability” and sacrificed if they turn out to lack it. So we’re back
on icky old-school drow territory here.</p>

<p>The newest arrival to Gauntlgrym is a Xorlarrin expedition. They’re after the
sleeping primordial, wanting to control it and use it to turn Gauntlgrym into a
drow capital to rival Menzonberranzan. Their encounter table is all drow and
unlike most others it goes up to level 14. We also get stats for a Drow
Spellspinner, a Level 8 Artillery mage that uses lightning-based spells.</p>

<p>These drow feel like an optional addition, and work best if you have a Bregan
D’Aerthe spy in your party. If that’s the case, they work well to tie that PC
more strongly to the campaign’s “endgame”, since the Bregan would want to
prevent a Drow house from gaining control of a primordial. For added drama, the
Xorlarrin could have been the ones responsible for destroying the PC’s own
house, or that of one of their friends. They’ve sent their own spies to the
surface, so that can provide the party with an initial lead to follow.</p>

<h2 id="the-fires-below">The Fires Below</h2>

<p>This is less of a faction and more of a grab-bag of thematically related
monsters. These are the elemental creatures that live beneath Mount Hotenow and
usually feed on slumbering Maegera’s ambient magic. They got very happy with her
awakening and the volcano’s eruption and some of them want to find a way to
awaken her for good.</p>

<p>Unlike most other groups with a similar goal, they don’t intend to control the
primordial once she’s awake, but to serve her instead. I don’t think they are
likely to succeed on their own, since they’ve been at it for 30 years with
nothing to show for it. They’re more intended as a group of secondary
antagonists that you find on your way to Maegera’s resting place… or as an
additional complication if someone else <em>does</em> manage to wake her up. Whoever
ends up controlling Maegera will also get to order these creatures around.</p>

<p>The encounter table here is all about fire and/or earth elementals, and it goes
up to level 14. We also get a couple of new stat blocks for salamanders.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Continuing our exploration of the minor factions at play here, we’ll now look at
those whose presence or attention are centered on the Neverwinter Wood.</p>

<h2 id="gray-wolf-uthgardt">Gray Wolf Uthgardt</h2>

<p>The Gray Wolves were just another typical Uthgardt tribe of no particular
distinction until a few hundred years ago, when they took in human refugees from
Gauntlgrym who had been fleeing their captivity by the mind flayers who lived
there. Some of those had been afflicted by lycanthropy. Time and primal magic
made this condition the tribe’s main power and badge of honor.</p>

<p>In the context of the Neverwinter campaign, this is kinda bad for the PCs
because the Gray Wolves have been captivated by the Shadovar’s honeyed words and
recruited as their agents and shock troops. They expect to be citizens of their
new world-spanning empire, and to be given dominion over all of the North’s
wilderness in exchange for their service.</p>

<p>Fortunately, not all members of the tribe fell for this. Those that didn’t were
cast out and banded together into a group known as the Forsworn, who work to
oppose the works of the Netherese. The Forsworn avoid fighting their own kin,
but the Grey Wolves do not return the favor and try to kill them on sight.</p>

<p>The book recommends using existing werewolf and shifter stat blocks when
building encounters against Grey Wolves, and gives us stats for a Werewolf
Stormcaller (level 6 Artillery) that fulfills a niche not usually covered by
those blocks. It also has stats for Ethraniev Marrowslake, a particularly
bloodthirsty Gray Wolf pack leader (level 7 brute). Both work as you’d expect
for werewolves, with the ability to change shape and both weapon and infectious
bite attacks. The stormcaller has ranged spells that do lightning or thunder
damage.</p>

<p>The Pack Outcast PC was among the first of the Gray Wolves to be exiled, since
they didn’t agree to join the Shadovar right at the start. The Forsworn were
exiled after that, as the tribe’s tactics became more and more violent. As the
campaign start, dissidents are being executed instead of exiled. The Outcast has
an easy in with the Forsworn as written, because the group will likely recognize
the PC as being right all along.</p>

<p>The book says the GM is free to make the Forsworn still be evil if they don’t
want the PCs allying with them, though I probably wouldn’t do that. It leans too
much on the “savage barbarian” trope.</p>

<p>PCs who become friends of the Forsworn might be granted an utility power named
<strong>Primal Surge</strong> as a blessing or reward. It’s an encounter power that triggers
when you use one of your other encounter powers. It lets you roll a d20, and on
a result of 10 or higher the other power is not expended.</p>

<h2 id="iliyanbruen-fey">Iliyanbruen Fey</h2>

<p>This is the group the Iliyanbruen Guardian PC belongs to. As we saw earlier,
they’re descendants of eladrin who fled to the Feywild to survive the
destruction caused on their kingdom by the fall of Xinlenal. When the barriers
between worlds started thinning, they sent expeditions back to the place where
they crossed, and found it occupied by evil fey. They drove those out, and built
an outpost named New Shandarar on both sides of the portal. Then they explored
their old ruins in the middle world and discovered that they had been ravaged by
more than time and disuse - many of their sacred relics and cultural treasures
had been plundered.</p>

<p>The expeditionary force made it their mission to recover what was stolen. All of
them are pretty angry about this: the main difference is some of them are angry
just at the people responsible for the looting, while others are angry at All
The Mortals and want to genocide/conquer the region on principle.</p>

<p>Whether moderate or extremist, the fey of Iliyanbruen are likely to respond with
violence to anyone trespassing on their territory now, unless the Guardian PC is
with them.</p>

<p>The expedition’s commander, Merrisara Winterwhite, is a moderate and the main
reason they haven’t started attacking the region. Several of the community
leaders under her, however, are extremists, and spend all of their time
agitating for more bloodshed. One in particular, a dude named Addemios
Three-Dawn, is a secret worshiper of Asmodeus and in league with the evil fey
the expedition drove away from the portal. He’s the assistant to one of the
city’s priests of Corellon, and his influence is responsible for a lot of the
recent upswing in violent sentiment among the eladrin.</p>

<p>The encounter table for New Shandarar is made up of heroic-tier fey creatures:
elves, eladrin, dryads, unicorns, treants and lots of trained fey
beasts. Addemios is statted up as Level 5 Artillery with ranged and area
spells. He’s far from the most powerful individual in this faction, so I’m
guessing that getting them to back off would involve more than defeating
him. That’d still be an important step, though.</p>

<p>Should the extremists win out, the fey could move to “major faction” status
relatively quickly, as they are a significant military force with some pretty
powerful creatures. They certainly <em>believe</em> they have what it takes to conquer
the region and kill everyone they dislike, but they are probably unaware of the
true extent of the Thayan, Netherese, and Aberrant presences here.</p>

<h2 id="cult-of-the-dragon">Cult of the Dragon</h2>

<p>Unlike the Ashmadai, these cultists have a lot of trouble passing as typical
citizens. The local cell was busy with the usual Cult of the Dragon activities,
which are sucking up to evil dragons and trying to convince them to become
dracoliches. This changed when Valindra (the lich leading the Thayans) took
their leader’s Ring of the Dragon.</p>

<p>Now they work for her as muscle and are also tasked with finding a way to raise
the dead Lorragauth as a dracolich. Their leader, Adimund Kroskas, is working on
that as slowly as possible while he tries to figure out a way to recover his
ring. He hasn’t made much progress in that either and desperately needs
something to change in his situation. He’ll probably try to make a move when a
significant setback occurs in Valindra’s plan - likely one caused by the PCs.</p>

<p>Their encounter table includes humans, genasi, dragonborn, and other “typically
playable” stat blocks.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Looks like I accidentally skipped a few posts when making my last update! So
instead of going to chapter 04 now, we’ll finish out chapter 03 and look at the
minor factions over this and the next two posts.</p>

<p>These factions are considered “minor” because they’re either simpler, less
powerful, or less involved in the region than the majors. Most don’t have custom
stat blocks associated with them, and even if they do I’ll only spend time on
them if they’re really interesting. This post covers the “urban” factions, those
whose territories and attentions are in the city proper.</p>

<h2 id="dead-rats">Dead Rats</h2>

<p>Looks like the wererat gang has a chapter in Neverwinter, led by a one-eyed
lieutenant of Toytere’s name Rrost. Their main racket is smuggling, and as the
campaign starts they managed to set themselves up as the middlemen in the
weapons trade between the Sons of Alagondar and the Thayans. More on that later.</p>

<p>In the longer term, the Rats would like to usurp control of the rebels and use
them to become big shots in the city’s underworld, remaking it in Luskan’s
image.</p>

<p>Their roster features rats, dire rats, and any low-level thug-types you can fit
in, the latter of which can be boosted by a wererat theme pack that gives them
regeneration, an infectious bite, and the ability to assume hybrid form. Rrost
uses the stats for a <strong>Wererat Mugger</strong> introduced here, a Level 4 Brute with a
poisoned morningstar and a stronger bite than what’s in the theme.</p>

<p>The gang would love to kill the Dead Rat Deserter PC, and their ties to the
Thayans are just the thing to get that PC more personally involved in the
campaign’s larger plots.</p>

<h3 id="impressions">Impressions</h3>

<p>Rrost feels like a “Small Bad” who will be a problem at the start of the
campaign for city-focused parties. His plans are big but his faction has no hope
of seeing them realized before the PCs end the Rats’ ambitions for good.</p>

<h2 id="sons-of-alagondar">Sons of Alagondar</h2>

<p>The Sons of Alagondar are die-hard Neverwinter nationalists who believe the city
should be independent of foreign control so that it can once again be the Jewel
of the North and a bastion of goodness. They draw most of their membership from
the holdout population of Neverwinter: those people who never left the city and
spent twenty years protecting and rebuilting it before Neverember arrived with
his mercs. As you might imagine, they vehemently oppose him.</p>

<p>Until very recently their overall leader was a Harper named Cymril, who was
brutally murdered under mysterious circumstances shortly before the start of the
campaign (as seen in the Harper Agent theme). Her death split the Sons into two
sub-factions along generational lines.</p>

<p>On one side you have the Nashers, who take their name from the first Alagondar
lord (the one from the computer games). These young rebels are willing to pay
any cost to see a free Neverwinter and readily resort to violent actions like
rioting, assassination and sabotage. Their leader is a firebrand named Arlon
Bladeshaper.</p>

<p>On the other you have the older Graycloaks, who take their name from the old
city militia. They see themselves as focusing on the big picture, with the
city’s welfare as their highest priority. They focus on building support and
alliances with like-minded groups and the city’s population in general. They
also try to infiltrate and influence Neverember’s organization through bribery,
blackmail, and secret deals. Their leader is the human mage Madame Rosene.</p>

<p>(The Nashers call the Graycloaks “greyhairs”, and the Graycloaks call the Nasher
“gnashers”. Also, there’s a subsection here titled “Fractured but Whole”, which
I can never take seriously after learning about that South Park game.)</p>

<p>It’s the Nashers who decided to partner with and accept help from the Dead Rat
gang and the Thayans. Bladeshaper was a bit leery of this at first but he
quickly changed his mind once he saw his faction start racking up bigger
victories against Neverember’s forces. The Rats, as mentioned before, plan to
take over the Sons and make them into an extension of their planned crime
syndicate. The Thayans are using them to distract New Neverwinter from their own
shenanigans and are happy to push their own agents and the Sons to ever greater
heights of violence to that purpose.</p>

<p>The encounter table for the Sons is entirely composed of stat blocks belonging
to typically playable ancestries, matching Neverwinter’s demographics. Players
who oppose the Sons will do well to play on their divisions, those who want to
support them should focus on healing that same rift. Cymril’s death nearly broke
them completely, and finding the truth behind it would be a big goal in a
rebellion campaign. As we saw in the Harper Agent’s background, there’s room for
a variety of sinister explanations.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-1">Impressions</h3>

<p>Probably the most complex of the minor factions here. It’s possible to make a
campaign entirely focused on the Sons’ struggle, but it would have to start with
earning their trust. They are <em>not</em> predisposed to allying with PCs and are
likely to be actively hostile to certain themes like the Harper Agent or even
the Neverwinter Noble, whom they might see as just another pretender.</p>

<h2 id="harpers">Harpers</h2>

<p>Making Neverwinter into the bastion of good it once was is also part of the
Harper’s mission statement, and they are generally better at sticking to it than
the Sons, but they were broken even more thoroughly by Cymril’s death. She was
their highest ranking member in the area. With her gone, there are about a dozen
members left, and only two of them are full agents.</p>

<p>These local Harpers are pretty focused on opposing Neverember at the moment and
are completely ignorant of the machinations of the Thayans, Netherese, or
Aboleths in the area. It’s unlikely they will find out on their own, but if they
learn through other means they will instantly shift their focus to opposing
these greater threats.</p>

<p>If the PCs manage to acquire a reputation as local heroes, the Harpers might
approach them and ask them to help the Sons of Alagondar get back on track.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-2">Impressions</h3>

<p>The Harper presence in the city is larger than I was led to believe from reading
the Harper Agent theme. My inclination is to only include them as written if the
party doesn’t have one or more PCs with that theme. If it does, then the PC is
the sole Harper left in the region.</p>

<h2 id="many-arrows-orcs">Many-Arrows Orcs</h2>

<p>The orcs of the North usually stayed away from the Neverwinter area, because the
city was hostile to them and they had many stories about how the surrounding
woods were haunted. They have recently dismissed these stories as myths and
grown a little bolder and more curious.</p>

<p>King Obould XVII of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows recently sent a scout force here
with the mission to find what was going on and report back, but the force’s
power-hungry commander far exceeded her orders and decided to push into the city
and take over the Cloak Tower, claiming the surrounding territory in
Neverwinter’s ruined northern half as her own.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, Obould was depicted elsewhere as a reasonable king who
had the capability to turn his people away from their universally hostile ways
and forge more peaceful bonds with his neighbors. Commander Vansi is none of
those things. After taking over the Cloak Tower, she was approached by the
aboleths and gladly accepted a “blessing” of the Spellplague to get
stronger. There’s a stat block for her here. She’s a Level 6 Soldier (Leader)
that fights with a flail and a spiked gauntlet. The Spellplague covered her in
fiery bone spurs, so she loves to grapple.</p>

<p>The encounter table for them is obviously all orcs all the time, with the
occasional ogre or half-orc thrown in for variety.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-3">Impressions</h3>

<p>I kinda like that there’s a more elaborate reason than just “they’re chaotic
evil” for why this group of orcs are hostile occupiers. Neverember has an open
call for adventurers willing to help drive them out of town, and their
connection to the AbSov might be what clues the PCs in to the presence of that
faction.</p>

<p>It’s even possible that King Obould would <em>reward</em> the PCs for dealing with the
rogue detachment if you want to play up the newer, less hostile orcish
civilization.</p>

<h2 id="bregan-daerthe">Bregan D’Aerthe</h2>

<p>These assholes again. They wrung Luskan dry a few decades ago and left the area
when the cataclysm hit. Now a handful of their spies have made their way back to
seek profitable opportunities and report back.</p>

<p>In practice this means you can spice up certain encounters with drow mercs or
informants. They have no elaborate goals for the area yet.</p>

<h3 id="impressions-4">Impressions</h3>

<p>Again, this feels like a minor faction I would only use if there are no Bregan
Spy PCs in the party. If there are, then the PC is their sole representative in
the region. They appear again in a slightly more fun form in the upcoming
locations chapter.</p>
