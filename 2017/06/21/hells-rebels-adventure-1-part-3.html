<p>Welcome to another installment of “Let’s Read Hell’s Rebels!” You can find links
to the whole series in its <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/">project page</a>. This time we’ll go through Part 3
of its first adventure. It’s titled “Redactions and Revelations”.</p>

<p>As always, we’ll be taking a look at how our hypotethical party consisting
of <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/27/pathfinder-df-knight.html">Valeros</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/08/pathfinder-df-bard.html">Lem</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/30/pathfinder-df-rogue.html">Merisiel</a> and <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/15/pathfinder-df-cleric.html">Kyra</a> would fare here as GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy delvers.</p>

<p>As I probably mentioned in a previous post, Rexus’ parents were members of the
Sacred Order of Archivists, a secret society of Irori<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> worshippers dedicated
to discovering and preserving the true history of Kintargo and Cheliax. The
Chelish government dislikes them intensely, since they’re all about redacting
that truth and replacing it with their own propaganda<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. That’s why they
burned the Victocora estate down with most of the family inside.</p>

<p>Rexus, however, believes his parents might still be alive and hiding in the
Order’s secret headquarters. His conviction that this must be the case grows as
he works on the Silver Ravens document cache the PCs retrieve in part 1. Some
time after that work is complete, he approaches the Ravens and proposes they
look for his parents.</p>

<p>He reveals the hideout’s location, under an abandoned museum of curiosities
named Hocum’s Fantasmagorium. He’s never been there, but one of the things in
the box his parents left for him was a mytrhil key that opens the secret door to
the compound. At the very least, the place should contain some of his mother’s
personal effects. Laria also encourages the PCs to go there, since if the
Archivists survive they’d be the perfect allies.</p>

<p>Unlike the more freewheeling part 2, this one consists of a single large dungeon
delve, but we still have some flexibility in deciding when it starts. Rexus will
only approach the PCs for this after he finishes the translation, but you can
decide exactly when that happens. Starting it while multiple other missions from
Part 2 are still ongoing is perfect to give your players a sense of “so many
things to do, so little time”, but if you think they’re already feeling
overwhelmed it might be better to wait until the other stuff is done. The book
recommends waiting since it thinks the PCs should be level 3 to have a chance
here… but if you’re running this using GURPS Dungeon Fantasy, there’s no need
for that.</p>

<h2 id="hocums-phantasmagorium">Hocum’s Phantasmagorium</h2>

<p>One thing the PCs will quickly discover when they begin casing this joint is
that the Asmodeans got here first. The Barzilai himself visited this place years
ago disguised as a traveling scholar, on his quest to learn about the dark
ritual that would make him immortal. Once he took power in Kintargo, he turned
over the hideout’s location to the Church of Asmodeus, and they sent a team of
ninja librarians to take it out and Redact All The Things. Some of them are
still here, hard at work, and Thrune sometimes sends his henchwoman Nox to keep
an eye on them.</p>

<p>Some judicious information gathering by the PCs prior entering the site can
reveal the presence of the Asmodeans, otherwise they’re in for a surprise. The
museum’s doors are all sturdy with good locks, but the mytrhil key opens all of
them.</p>

<p>Searching the <strong>Box Office (E2)</strong> will net the PCs some loose change and a <em>ring
of swimming</em><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. The <strong>Hall of the Cryptids (E3)</strong> is full of fake or
mislabeled skeletons, some of which have been animated by the Asmodeans to act
as guardians. The <strong>Hall of the Seas (E4)</strong> has a couple of spontaneously
generated undead mermaid-things who rise from their aquarium at night.</p>

<p>The <strong>Hall of Insects (E5)</strong> is now home to a clutch of giant spiders who were
accidentally broken out of stasis by a greedy Asmodean who mistook the souvenir
badge amid the eggs as a big treasure, which makes the stuff on his corpse the
<em>actual</em> treasure at this location.</p>

<p>That’s it for the west wing of the building. The east wing has a wax gallery in
room <strong>E7</strong> that might give the PCs a scare if they think he statues will
animate (they won’t, but one of their eyes is a gem). Room <strong>E8</strong> has a bunch of
charred zombie guards who will attack anyone not wearing Asmodean colors. These
are the corpses of the people who were inside the Victocora estate, including
Rexus’ parents, who still wear their wedding rings. Bringing the rings back to
Rexus will give him some closure and a bonus XP reward.</p>

<p>Rooms <strong>E9</strong> and <strong>E10</strong> are the gift shop and the administrative office. They
currently house a team of ninja librarians (AKA Asmodean Redactors with levels
in Monk) and their evil cleric boss, hard at work reviewing museum documents for
inconvenient truths. They’ll probably move to investigate any commotion in the
museum level. The redactors should be built on 125 points with Martial Artist
skills and abilities, and the cleric is a full 250-point Evil Cleric with a
spell selection that allows invisibility and paralysis.</p>

<p>Room <strong>E6</strong>, right in the middle and back of the building, is a small exibit on
the dead god Aroden. His statue hides the secret passage to the hideout
below. PCs can figure out the combination to open it if they pay attention. They
can also brute-force the lock through skill checks or actual brute force.</p>

<h2 id="the-many-steps-monastery">The Many-Steps Monastery</h2>

<p>This is the hideout proper. It’s occupied by the bulk of the redactor task force
and their assorted bodyguards and defenses, including Nox, the regenerating
henchwoman they met in passing during Part 1. It’s deep enough underground that
the enemies here can’t hear fights happening topside. The name is a joke about
the amount of stairs in the place, made by its former Iroran occupants. Unlike
the museum, the layout of this lower level is mostly linear.</p>

<p>The stairs from area E6 above lead into <strong>The Sacred Archive (F1)</strong>, a cavernous
library that used to be filled with historical records and rare tomes (made
rarer by Chelish redacting). The place is now almost bare, with the few
remaining tomes waiting to be examined by the redactors. It’s guarded by a type
of outsider called a Scrivenite, which is basically a living book that can take
a humanoid form made out of fluttering pages and long bookmark ribbons. This one
has been bound to aid the redactors, is quite resentful of the fact, and will
gladly answer questions about the other defenses and enemies down here as long
as the PCs don’t try to advance further into the complex. They will eventually
have to, which will cause the spirit to warn the other redactors
telepathically. If the PCs can somehow prevent it from doing so, they will have
the element of surprise.</p>

<p>Areas <strong>F2</strong> and <strong>F3</strong> were the living quarters for the Archivists, now taken
over by the redactors. If the PCs manage to get here without raising an alarm,
there’s a chance they can catch Nox sleeping.</p>

<p>Area <strong>F4</strong> is the <strong>Artifact Recovery</strong> room. The Archivists were also in the
business of locking dangerous cursed artifacts away, it seems. Most of the stuff
here has been carted off to Barzilai’s opera house base, but something called a
<em>cubic gate</em> was left behind. I suspect this is one of those Hellraiser puzzle
boxes, given the mess it made when the redactors activated it by
mistake. Four of them are in here trying to figure the thing out. They’ll
hide in the room and watch the PCs fiddle with it for a while before
attacking. See? Ninja librarians.</p>

<p>Area <strong>F5</strong> is a mostly uninteresting lecture hall, currently used as a kennel
for Nox’s pet hell hound. If the PCs get this far without raising an alarm, the
creature will be here.</p>

<p>Next is the <strong>Common Room (F6)</strong>, which is where most of the redacting work
currently happens. There’s five Redactors in here plus a half-ogre
bodyguard. Pathfinder half-ogres are horribly deformed and mentally handicapped
wretches, in keeping with the game’s theme of “ogres as inbred cannibal
hillbillies”. This one’s mind has been further muddled by years of Asmodean
mental control. It should be built with the Brute and Half-Ogre templates, with
particularly low IQ. Smart PCs can easily divide-and-conquer this lot, since the
half-ogre won’t attack unless the PCs attack it directly or try to move past it
to the next area.</p>

<p>The final area is the <strong>Meditation Garden (F7)</strong>, a large chamber with an
underground river running through it and some impressive landscaping. This is
where Nox and her pet hellhound can usually be found, so you might as well call
this place the “Boss Fight” room.</p>

<p>Nox is <em>technically</em> human, but she’s sold her soul to a devil in exchange for
power. She’s a level 5 fighter specializing in polearms, who can also
regenerate, teleport and summon a lemure. In GURPS, she should be built with the
Knight template and wield a dueling glaive, and should have Unholy powers
matching her supernatural abilities from D&amp;D. Overcoming her regeneration should
require Holy attacks, and the book also suggests that drowning her in the
underground river would kill her for good. If Nox dies, she definitely won’t be
coming back - her contract ensures her soul goes straight to hell.</p>

<p>Would a cleric’s spells automatically count as Holy Attacks? That’s an
interesting question. The original Pathfinder weakness is “good spells or good
weapons”, so maybe you have to use a Holy Might power from a Good
deity. The general guideline is that she should have the same vulnerabilities as
a real demon in your campaign.</p>

<p>After the PCs deal with Nox, they can loot the room of the books she’s been
reading to pass the time. These were created by the scrivenite we described
above, and contain a rendering of the memories and knowledge of several of the
deceased Archivists… including Rexus’ parents. Through these, it’s possible to
procure their aid, after a fashion.</p>

<h2 id="adventure-conclusion-and-commentary">Adventure Conclusion And Commentary</h2>

<p>The Fantasmagorium looks like a pretty standard dungeon delve if you play it as
written: enter room, kill enemies, loot, rinse, repeat. While it’s true that the
people in one level can’t hear what goes on in the other, there’s no reason why
all those ninja librarians and their assorted hencthings wouldn’t investigate
fights happening on the <em>same</em> level. So you <em>can</em> run this dungeon as a brutal
raid where most enemies in the level converge on your party as soon as the alarm
is raised. This would be murder on a level 3 Pathfinder party, of course, but
might be just the thing to make it really challenging to a party of Dungeon
Fantasy delvers. Conversely, if the party takes pains to be stealthy and remain
undetected, this could be a tense infiltration mission where success is rewarded
with plenty of opportunity to shank surprised villains.</p>

<p>Clearing out the museum and hideout officially concludes the adventure. If you
haven’t played through all the events of Part 2, the book advises doing so
before moving on, and generally giving the PCs some room to breathe. By the end
of Adventure 1 they should be well on track to becoming the most powerful
opposition to Barzilai’s government.</p>
