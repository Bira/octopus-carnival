<p>I’ll begin this review by saying I’m really not the best person to review the
<strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> (DFRPG). It’s not that dislike it: in fact,
I loved it! However, I’m really bad at reading through the text in detail and
spotting all the differences between the game and the GURPS supplements that
originated it. I know these differences exist, and I know they make the game
better, but I’ll probably only internalize them when I reference the text in
play enough times.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it seems I’m late to the party when it comes to reviewing the
<strong>DFRPG</strong>, so I can point you to lots of other reviews by other people who are
better at this than me! Just Roll 3d6 has very detailed reviews of
the <a href="http://justroll3d6.com/dfrpg-review-adventurers/">Adventurers</a> and <a href="http://justroll3d6.com/dfrpg-review-exploits/">Exploits</a> books. <a href="https://pseudoboo.blogspot.com.br/">Let’s GURPS</a> is reviewing all
the recently-released books too. And I’m sure many other reviews will pop up in
time.</p>

<p>What I’ll do in this article is something only I can do: give you my own opinion
on the game. Whether that is of any value is left as an exercise for the
reader.</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL; DR</h2>

<p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> is my favorite edition of D&amp;D. Go out
and buy it as soon as it comes out.</p>

<h2 id="wait-what">Wait, What?</h2>

<p>Technically, my favorite edition of D&amp;D is 4th, but it occupies that position
for very specific reasons. It allows me to run cool, flashy battles in the style
of turn-based tactical RPGs such as Disgaea, Fire Emblem, or Final Fantasy
Tactics. If I want a campaign that feels like that, I reach for D&amp;D 4.</p>

<p>If I don’t want to run a campaign that feels like that, my tastes get a bit
fiddlier. I will <em>play</em> D&amp;D 5th edition if no other alternative presents itself,
but it doesn’t look very exciting to GM. Earlier editions add to that an
elaborate list of varied complaints that I’m sure anyone familiar with them can
guess, and I’m not one of those enlightened souls who can forget about them for
long enough to enjoy a session.</p>

<p>The <strong>Dungeon Fantasy Roleplaying Game</strong> has a premise that’s exactly like that
of Basic D&amp;D (one of the most popular OSR darlings), married to a ruleset that
does everything most editions of D&amp;D do in a way I find better. It’s
point-based! It has a unified mechanic! It has a good skill system!
Warrior-types are <em>actually</em> better at combat than spellcasters!</p>

<p>You can of course also run flashy set-piece battles with it, and they’ll tend to
have a feel that’s closer to that of the old-school editions.</p>

<p>It takes all of that from GURPS. Its rules are a specialized version of GURPS
4th Edition, with everything that’s not relevant to dungeon-crawling fantasy
campaigns stripped out and the rest adapted to the purpose. Some parts are
simpler than in the original rules, some are not, but they’re all useful. A lot
of those things which usually lead to heated arguments between players and DMs
are given proper rules and effects here. Want to stab that ogre in the eye?
Perform some unlikely feat of parkour? Check to see if that dead monster has
valuable body parts? The system has you covered.</p>

<p><strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> gives you 11 “professional templates” that are roughly
equivalent to some of the most popular D&amp;D classes, and which can be humans or
one of a selection of 8 racial templates that includes all the usual suspects
plus the Catfolk<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>While the game focuses very heavily on dungeon-delving, it’s certainly possible
to use it for fantasy campaigns that go beyond the dungeon. It has more support
for social interaction than Basic D&amp;D does<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and bringing in more detailed
rules from GURPS is extremely easy, if the GM thinks it’s necessary.</p>

<p>So yes, if I was planning on running a D&amp;D-ish campaign and wasn’t after the
very specific feel of D&amp;D 4 combat, I would use <strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> in
preference to any other actual edition of D&amp;D. In fact, I have been doing
just that for years using the previous iteration of these rules, and will gladly
switch to the new one now that I have it in my hands.</p>

<p><strong>Dungeon Fantasy</strong> isn’t yet available to the public as of this writing, but
the Kickstarter backers have already begun receiving their copies. Both the
printed and PDF versions should appear on <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com">Warehouse 23</a> in October.</p>
