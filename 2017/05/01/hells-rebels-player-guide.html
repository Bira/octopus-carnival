<p>This part of a series! Go to the <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/">project page</a> to see all entries.</p>

<p>When reading an adventure in this way, it’s useful and fun to imagine a group of
PCs going through them, and try to figure out how they can tackle each
challenge. Who should make up our PC party here? Let’s read through the Player’s
Guide and find out what the game expects of us.</p>

<h2 id="the-hells-rebels-player-guide">The Hell’s Rebels Player Guide</h2>

<p>Out of all the books in this adventure path, the Player’s Guide is the only one
that’s free. You can find it <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btpy9g44?Pathfinder-Adventure-Path-Hells-Rebels-Players-Guide">here</a>. It begins with a partial account of the
background for this adventure path.</p>

<p>I already talked about the background in my <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/04/24/hells-rebels.html">last post</a>, so I’m going to skip
it here. Let’s go through the other sections in the book based on the titles I
see in its PDF index.</p>

<h3 id="character-tips">Character Tips</h3>

<p>This part of the book is meant to guide players on how to create appropriate
characters for this campaign. Pathfinder is a system with a lot of moving
parts. Base Classes! Archetypes! Prestige classes! Skills! Feats! This section
goes over each of these and points out which ones would work best. In typical
Pathfinder fashion, it doesn’t explicitly <em>forbid</em> anything, but it does point
out in a roundabout way that not following these recommendations will lead to a
sub-optimal experience.</p>

<p>The gist of the thing, and the part most useful to someone converting this to
GURPS, is that Hell’s Rebels is a mostly urban campaign with strong elements of
intrigue. Your PCs should be able to operate well in a city, and should be good
at subterfuge and socializing. They’re also supposed to take charge of a rebel
organization, so leadership skills would also be strongly recommended. It goes
almost without saying that there will be plenty of combat in the campaign, so
your party should have that covered as well.</p>

<p>This section also presents rules for activities they expect to be common in the
campaign: concealing your religion (several Good faiths are outlawed),
deciphering old documents, and hiding bodies.</p>

<p>There’s also a section on religion, describing how the cults of the core
Golarion deities operate in the city and how the Thrune government sees
them. Generally, the closer to Chaotic and Good a deity is, the more outlawed
their faith is in Kintargo. Even those Good faiths that weren’t officially
outlawed got hit with arson and assassination prior to Barzilai officially
taking power. As long as your PC doesn’t worship an outright Evil deity, they’ll
have a reason to rebel on religious grounds if nothing else.</p>

<h3 id="reasons-to-protest">Reasons to Protest</h3>

<p>The first scene in the adventure is a protest, and this section lists possible
reasons for the PCs to be there. Yes, actually protesting the government is one
of these reasons, but they could also be looking for a missing celebrity they’re
a fan of, looking for a contact with information on the Silver Ravens (see
below) or just tagging along to keep another PC out of trouble. Each choice
gives minor bonuses for that scene only.</p>

<h3 id="campaign-traits">Campaign Traits</h3>

<p>This one should probably have appeared before <em>Reasons to Protest</em>, as the
information here provides some much needed context for some of those
reasons. Each PC is supposed to pick a trait, and they both tie the PC to the
setting and give them bonuses to paper over the deficiencies in Pathfinder’s
skill system (such as making a skill important to the campaign a class skill for
the character, or boosting their Charisma for the purposes of one
rebellion-related activity).</p>

<h3 id="milani">Milani</h3>

<p>Milani is the Chaotic Good patron of rebels and hope, and this bit contains some
additional mechanical benefits for worshipping her. I imagine the other gods get
these in other Pathfinder books.</p>

<h3 id="kintargo-at-a-glance">Kintargo At a Glance</h3>

<p>This section contains information any PC living in Kintargo would know, some of
which I already touched upon in my last post. The Chelish Civil War gets a lot
of mentions - that’s the period of strife following Aroden’s death and ending
with House Thrune in power. Kintargo only submitted grudgingly, and has remained
a particularly rebellious place ever since.</p>

<p>There’s a list of all the significant factions in Kintargo, and there’s quite a
few of them. They can be generally divided into factions friendly to Thrune,
rebel or dissident factions (most of which got hit pretty badly) and neutral
factions which can go either way as the campaign progresses.</p>

<p>Then there’s a stat block for the city of Kintargo itself! After that we get to
a fairly long list of locations, all marked in a city map. I imagine most of
them will become significant at different points during the campaign, so I’ll
probably discuss them in the detail when they come up.</p>

<p>And finally, we have some publicly known info on Barzilai Thrune. Unlike the
politician I’m obviously satirizing, this campaign’s villain sports a spartan
buzz cut and apparently never took a lover in his life. He does have a tendency
to fly into an incoherent rage over the smallest annoyances, though.</p>

<h3 id="the-silver-ravens">The Silver Ravens</h3>

<p>The Silver Ravens were listed among the factions of Kintargo, and mentioned in
passing several times before that. They’re an old secret society that defended
Kintargo from outside threats as far back as the Chelish Civil War. They sorta
faded away after that, and if any members remained today they were killed by
Barzilai’s goons. They’re still important, though, since the PC’s goal for the
campaign should be to re-establish the Silver Ravens and use them to liberate
the city.</p>

<p>This section provides complete campaign-specific rules for statting up and
running the organization. It tracks the size and influence of the rebellion with
a character-like level chart, using its number of supporters as XP. Each level
gives the PCs a personal benefit. There’s a whole strategy minigame where
players can recruit specialized “units” that can perform specific actions, and
so on. PCs will be able to make use of these special actions to obtain an edge
in the various dungeon delves in the adventures themselves.</p>

<h2 id="gurps-conversion-notes">GURPS Conversion Notes</h2>

<p>If you plan to run this in GURPS, I would recommend using the <strong>Dungeon
Fantasy</strong> rules as a base. The “gist” of the character creation guidelines
applies here too: your PCs should either start with social, subterfuge and
leadership skills, or should be able to quickly acquire them with earned
points.</p>

<p>Like all adventure paths, this one assumes the PCs start at first
level. 250-point delvers are quite a bit more powerful than that, so GMs who
feel like replicating that “level one” feel should use the 125-point templates
from <strong>DF 15</strong>. Personally, I would go with the full 250-point templates, as I’m
somewhat tired of low-level challenges and like to get through them as soon as
possible. The differences between the two systems and the characters power
levels will interact with the adventure in an interesting way, with several
challenges become easier and some becoming harder.</p>

<p>Character <em>progression</em> can be handled in one of several ways. You could give
them one character point whenever the original rules give out “story award” XP,
and use the system in <strong>DF 3</strong> to award CP for fights. You could also just give
a larger sum whenever the PCs fulfill important story goals. Either way, the
resulting progression is likely to be somewhat slower than in D&amp;D, but faster
than in a typical GURPS game.</p>

<p>It’s probably safe to ignore the minor mechanical bonuses given under <em>Reasons
to Protest</em> and <em>Campaign Traits</em>. They seem to be there because not all
character classes have access to the skills marked as important for the
campaign, which isn’t a problem in GURPS. The GM should instead allow all PCs to
spend points in the equivalent GURPS skills! The <em>story</em> aspects of those
traits are still interesting, however, and might be useful as inspiration.</p>

<p>As for the “rebellion management system”, it seems to be entirely centered
around skill checks. This means an enterprising GM could simply replace the
Pathfinder skill checks with GURPS tests and use the whole thing mostly
as-is. Another interesting alternative would be to come up with a system based
on <strong>GURPS Boardroom and Curia</strong> and/or <strong>GURPS Social Engineering: Pulling
Rank</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="so-who-are-our-pcs">So Who Are Our PCs?</h2>

<p>It’s my understanding that the standard party size in Pathfinder is four, and
the cover of the first adventure helpfully suggests we
use <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/27/pathfinder-df-knight.html">Valeros the Fighter</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/08/pathfinder-df-bard.html">Lem the Bard</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/30/pathfinder-df-rogue.html">Merisiel the Rogue</a> and
<a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/15/pathfinder-df-cleric.html">Kyra the Cleric</a>. Some interior illustrations depict other characters, but
these four are particularly appropriate among the Iconics because their
alignments are at most one step away from Chaotic Good, and Lem in particular is
<em>all about</em> opposing Cheliax. I also happen to have ready-made stats for all of
them, so that’s another plus!</p>

<p>Picking out campaign traits for them is a bit trickier than I
anticipated, but not as important as it would be in Pathfinder because there are
no mechanical effects. “Gifted Satirist” fits Lem well, and “Natural Born
Leader” would fit Valeros because he already has the Born War Leader
advantage. Kyra, somewhat counter-intuitively, would get “Star-Struck”. She’s
not quite a fangirl, but Shensen the half-elf singer was one of the most
prominent worshippers of Sarenrae in Kintargo, and she vanished during Thrune’s
purges (which also saw her shop/Sarenrae shrine burned down). Merisiel gets
nothing. The opportunity to pick some pockets and shank some dottari gives her
more than enough motivation to join in. Lem and Kyra would have ample reason to
travel to Kintargo, with the other two tagging along out of friendship.</p>

<p>In my estimation, this party is vastly stronger than their 1st-level Pathfinder
equivalents would be. Not only because they’re built on more points, but because
having a fighter in your party is not a handicap in GURPS - quite the contrary!
Aside from combat power, each of them has several useful skills: Valeros is,
well, a Born War Leader; Lem is an adept socialite; Kyra can serve as his
backup; and Merisiel brings those ever-useful thief skills to the
table. Magic-wise, Lem has incredible utility (including the ability to <em>read
minds</em>) and Kyra can See Secrets in addition to the usual sun-cleric tricks of
healing allies and burning enemies. In the next post, we’ll begin going through
the first adventure in the path, the absurdly named “In Hell’s Bright Shadow”.</p>
