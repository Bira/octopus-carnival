<p>Welcome to another installment of “Let’s Read Hell’s Rebels!” You can find links
to the whole series in its <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/hells-rebels/">project page</a>. This time we’ll go through Part 2
of its first adventure. It’s titled “Rebuilding the Ravens”.</p>

<p>As always, we’ll be taking a look at how our hypotethical party consisting
of <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/11/27/pathfinder-df-knight.html">Valeros</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/08/pathfinder-df-bard.html">Lem</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/12/30/pathfinder-df-rogue.html">Merisiel</a> and <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/15/pathfinder-df-cleric.html">Kyra</a> would fare here as GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy delvers.</p>

<p>“Adventure Path” style modules have a reputation for being extremely
railroady. <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/05/10/hells-rebels-adventure-1.html">Part 1</a> certainly lives up to that, since it consists of a series
of tightly scripted scenes and two back-to-back dungeons where the PCs have no
real alternative other than delve right in.</p>

<p>In Part 2, however, we leave the rails behind for a bit! It starts by stating
that the PCs plus Rexus and Laria are the group best-positioned to offer
organized opposition to Barzilai Thrune in the whole of Kintargo. It goes to
show how thorough the guy was in killing everyone else, I guess, since right now
our heroes have a snowball’s chance in Hell of taking him down. Before they can
have a shot at The Barzilai, they need to expand the newborn Silver Ravens into
a proper rebel army and consolidate support for their position.</p>

<p>The PCs are expected to engage with the custom rebellion rules at this point,
which means this part of the adventure will play out over multiple weeks of game
time and will largely consist of PC-initiated actions and their consequences as
they focus on recruiting agents and gaining supporters. The book lists several
special events and missions that will happen or become available while the PCs
do this. By the end of the first adventure, the Silver Ravens should become a
substantial movement with broad support among the oppressed of Kintargo, and
should be ready to move out of Laria’s basement and into a more permanent base.</p>

<h2 id="a-spy-among-us">A Spy Among Us</h2>

<p>The events mostly concern Blosodriette, the imp the party has unwittingly
brought from the Fair Fortune Livery along with the documents they recovered
there. She will hang around the hideout either invisible or transformed into a
rat or spider. Her goal is to be set free without being banished back to Hell,
and she begins sabotaging the rebels in an attempt to either convince the PCs to
let her go or to attract attention from outside allies who can free her.</p>

<p>The GM is free to come up with clues and setbacks caused by the imp. Events in
the book go from structural sabotage to mind-controlling an otherwise innocent
NPC into betraying the group to the dottari. The PCs can thwart her in several
ways: finding the contract and ripping it up will send the imp back to Hell, as
will spotting the invisible devil and defeating her in combat. If a PC happens
to belong to the Sarini noble lineage, they can actually <em>command</em> Blosodriette
and turn her to their service, since the contract binds her to that lineage.</p>

<p>It’s probably best if these events are interspersed with the special missions
the book describes later, and/or with the normal turns of the rebellion
management mini-game. Solving each one gives the party a XP award, as does
defeating the imp. Of course, the party might end up finding the imp quite soon,
and all of this will be moot if they already dealt with her back at the
Livery. Defeating the devil early awards the party XP for any events that hadn’t
occurred yet; the party <em>was</em> successful in preventing them, after all.</p>

<p>There’s another unrelated event here that provides a bit of foreshadowing about
the Rose of Kintargo, an NPC who appears in the second adventure. Foreshadowing
is all this is, but I suppose it’s possible for a frustrated party to link
this to the imp’s sabotage instead. It’s something to watch out for.</p>

<h3 id="conversion-notes">Conversion Notes</h3>

<p>Blosodriette should be built as a Wizard with the Shapeshifting, Suggestion and
False Memory spells, plus any pre-requisites and other spells the GM deems
suitably annoying (like summoning swarms of rats). In her natural form, she’s SM
-3. Her advantages include Flight (Winged) and switchable Invisibility as an
advantage rather than as a spell, since she can keep it up for a very long
time. Her disadvantages include Sadism and an Obsession with being freed from
her contract, as well as any vulnerabilities common to demons and devils in your
game.</p>

<h2 id="missions">Missions</h2>

<p>These are “special missions” which occur outside the rebellion management
rules. They’re numbered, but can happen in any order as decided by the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="mission-1-decode-the-documents">Mission 1: Decode the Documents</h3>

<p>Decoding the documents requires skills with Linguistics and fluency in
Celestial, Elven and Strix. Rexus has all of this and will take 7 weeks to do
the job by himself, but PCs who also meet the prerequisites can try to help
shorten this time. Finishing the job in 4 weeks or less is worth bonus XP, and
regardless of the time it takes the party will get a permanent bonus to all
Silver Raven organization stats from the tactical information contained in
there. They’ll also learn a lot about the history of the original group.</p>

<p>Since this is a long-running thing, the PCs can obviously engage in other
activities or missions while it goes on.</p>

<h3 id="mission-2-investigate-the-fires">Mission 2: Investigate the Fires</h3>

<p>A lot of places connected to dissident characters and organizations burned down
in the Night of Ashes, and the PCs can look into those fires if they are so
inclined. The only site that will yield something of value are the ruins of the
Silver Star, Shensen’s shop, which has a hidden stash of potions and scrolls
which wasn’t damaged by the fire. More substantial clues as to what happened at
these locations will be found elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="mission-3-prisoners-of-salt">Mission 3: Prisoners of Salt</h3>

<p>Freeing the high-profile prisoners from Kintargo Castle might be more than what
the group can handle at this point, but that’s not the only place where
prisoners are being held. A group of rogues and mercenaries friendly to Laria is
being held prisoner at the Salix Salt Works, and they would make a good addition
to the Silver Ravens. They’re guarded by a group of thugs hired by Thrune.</p>

<p>The book provides a keyed map of the area, but this will be mostly just a big
brawl. There’s a total of eight CCG Thugs led by a dwarf fighter named Kessrin,
but only half of the group is on guard duty at any one time, with the other half
asleep in an outbuilding. Our hypothetical party should have no trouble at all
moping the floor with these doofuses, particularly if they strike at
night. Rescuing the prisoners allows the PCs to recruit them to the Ravens.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-notes-1">Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>We already discussed the CCG Thugs in Part 1. Kessrin should be built as a
well-armored dwarf Squire with a few extra points of ST, Overconfidence, and the
Throwing skill. He wields a mace and shield, and has a couple of alchemical
grenades. The original uses Tanglefoot Bags, but the GM might want to employ
something more devious like poisons or sleep potions.</p>

<h3 id="mission-4-murders-in-the-nursery">Mission 4: Murders In the Nursery</h3>

<p>Remember how I talked about Golarion having more horror elements than your
typical D&amp;D setting? We’ll get to see some of them here.</p>

<p>You see, tieflings face a lot of racial prejudice in Cheliax, even in
Kintargo. I find this a bit surprising in a nation that generally considers
everything devil-related to be just swell. Perhaps the justification for this is
in a setting book I don’t have. Most of Kintargo’s tieflings live in a decrepit
slum nicknamed “The Devil’s Nursery”, and the harassment they face when they try
to move out makes it very difficult for them to do so.</p>

<p>Thrune made their lives even worse by not only imprisoning the most effective
advocate for their civil rights during the Night of Ashes, but having a witch in
his employ conduct an horrific ritual in the Nursery that summoned a pack of
eight tooth fairies (the <em>Hellboy</em> kind, not the children’s story kind). The fey
roam around the slums every few days, killing people and taking their
teeth. It’s causing a panic that may erupt into a riot if nothing is done about
it. If the PCs help here, they’ll earn many supporters from among Kintargo’s
downtrodden.</p>

<p>This mission is a meaty investigative scenario - all the PCs know at the start
is that people are getting killed in the slums. This might require interviewing
reluctant witnesses, examining a body before the locals can cremate it, or even
having one of the PCs act as bait for the killers by wandering the streets alone
at night.</p>

<p>The fairies fight to the death once they’re cornered in their lair, which is
also where the PCs can find the remains of the ritual that summoned the fairies
here, which include the body of a child. Treating it with respect and solving
the case earns them extra supporters in the coming weeks.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-notes-2">Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>A GM who wants to really focus on the investigation here might break out the
rules from <strong>GURPS Monster Hunters</strong>, which cover the “identify the monster and
find it” part pretty well. Social skills would be useful for interviewing
witnesses, <strong>Diagnosis</strong> for examining the bodies, and <strong>Hidden Lore (Faeries)</strong>
to idenfity the culprits and their weaknesses.</p>

<p>Pathfinder Tooth Fairies are pixy-sized fey (SM -6) who wield magical pliers
that attack like SM 0 magical knives and give them the ability to pull out
someone’s teeth mid-fight. They also have a paralytic bite, and explode into
nauseating glitter when they die. The eight fairies in this encounter can give a
party who relies exclusively on physical attacks some unexpected trouble!</p>

<p>As for our party, this would mostly be Lem’s and Meririel’s show until they
managed to confront the fairies, in my estimation. Fighting them might be tricky
unless Lem can get off a Mass Daze or Mass Sleep spell, or Kyra can set them on
fire.</p>

<h3 id="mission-5-crackdown-at-clenchjaws">Mission 5: Crackdown at Clenchjaw’s</h3>

<p>Clenchjaw’s was a fairly unremarkable bar until recently. Now it’s becoming a
hotbed of anti-government sentment as well as the stage for huge, nightly
brawls. Its owner used to keep a lid on this stuff, but he’s been passing out
early each night for some weird reason. PCs can get involved here while looking
for recruits.</p>

<p>PCs who look hang around the bar long enough will eventually find out the cause
of the increased chaos is Vendalfek, a fairy dragon! He moved here after the
other bar he lived in was burned in the Night of Ashes, and has been using his
illusion powers to make Clenchjaw’s rowdier to stave off his boredom. This in
turn attracted more dissidents to the place.</p>

<p>Vendalfek can be convinced to stop his shenanigans peacefully, and some skilled
diplomacy might convince him to join the rebellion as a special ally. Outright
invinting him to live on their base will have the same result. Failing to
resolve the situation will eventually cause the bar to be raided, which will
cost the Ravens some supporters.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-notes-3">Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>Vendalfek should be based on the Shoulder Dragon template on p. 27 of <strong>GURPS
Dungeon Fantasy 5: Allies</strong>, with the addition of some spellcasting ability
focused on illusion. He makes a good spy, being basically a less powerful but
also less ethically questionable version of Blosodriette the imp.</p>

<h3 id="mission-6-an-unsanctioned-excruciation">Mission 6: An Unsanctioned Excruciation</h3>

<p>This section goes on a bit about “excruciations”, which are public torture and
humilation sessions the Chelish government likes to punish its dissidents and
criminals with. Barzilai’s preferred method is “doghousing”, in which the victim
is forced to share a space with two large angry dogs for days and choose between
fighting them for food or starving. No official excruciations are scheduled
during this adventure, but the ever punchable members of the Chelish Citizen’s
Group have decided to perform a few of their own.</p>

<p>This is an event that should happen once the Silver Ravens have gained a fair
bit of notoriety. The CCG captures a friendly NPC who isn’t a member of the
Ravens, perhaps someone who helped the PCs during Mission 4 or 5, and stages a
doghousing in Aria Park. The PCs should get wind of this fairly quickly once it
happens, since it’s not exactly a discreet event. It’s up to them whether and
when to stage a rescue, but waiting too long will obviously prove lethal for the
victim.</p>

<p>Fighting the four CCG thugs and their two big angry dogs would be a literal walk
in the part for our brave delvers. Doing so in a public fashion increases the
Ravens’ notoriety, but I personally think it’s worth it. The dottari show up a
few minutes after a fight breaks out, but by them the party will be long gone.</p>

<h3 id="mission-7-threat-of-the-red-jills">Mission 7: Threat of the Red Jills</h3>

<p>The Red Jills are a small but violent gang of thieves who are taking advantage
of the current chaos to prey on the citizens of Kintargo. They leave the dottari
and the CCG alone, so Thrune lets them keep operating to keep the population
afraid. As such, making them stop will benefit the Ravens.</p>

<p>Recruiting the Jills as allies isn’t possible: they’re led by Scarplume, a strix
with a particularly fierce hatred of humans. Tracking the Jills down to their
abandoned orphanage hideout will lead to a big fight.</p>

<h4 id="conversion-notes-4">Conversion Notes</h4>

<p>Once again the investigation rules from <strong>Action</strong> or <strong>Monster Hunters</strong> would
do a good job here! <strong>Streetwise</strong> and <strong>Area Knowledge (Kintargo)</strong> would be
particularly important for finding the hideout.</p>

<p>Strix are winged humanoids, and their stats should be basically like a human’s
aside from the Flight (Winged) advantage. Scarplume is a sorcerer whose spell
list can be summed up as “All The Fire”, which means she can be statted up as
either a Fire Elementalist or a DF Sorcerer with lots of burning Innate
Attacks. She has Intolerance (Humans) and a host of other sociopathic
disadvantages. The rest of the Jills should be built using the Cutpurse or
Skirmisher templates from <strong>DF 15</strong>, and should all be non-human.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>That’s it for part 2 of the book! Part 3 contains a substantial dungeon delve,
but doesn’t necessarily happen after all of the events here: the timing for that
is entirely up to the PCs, so they might end up having to deal with the stuff
here even into the second adventure.</p>
