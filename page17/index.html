          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/11/23/neverwinter-kolthunral.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: Kolthunral, the Flying Fortress</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Kolthunral is the Netherese flying fortress currently besieging Surcross. We’ll
look at it first because it kinda dominates the skyline and its goals are
important to contextualize everything else that’s going on in this area.</p>

<p>The arrival of the fortress was a complete surprise even to Szass Tam, who
considered the current conflict with the Netherese to be a distant and minor
dispute over Shadowfell supply routes way off to the west in Neverwinter.</p>

<p>That conflict is happening because, as we already know, both sides have ongoing
plots happening in the Neverwinter area and need a constant influx of material
and personnel from home: Valindra’s group is at the Dread Ring, and Clariburnus’
group is at Xinlenal. The Prince of Shade evidently disagreed with the lich
about the importance of the dispute and dispatched the fortress to solve it once
and for all.</p>

<p>There are many rumors and theories about why Szass Tam hasn’t gotten personally
involved in this battle. Some say that if he did it would attract the collective
attention of the other Princes of Shade and lead to one of those Realms-scouring
epic level wars everyone wants to avoid. Others say he realized all of this is
ultimately Valindra’s fault and he wants to see how she gets out of it.</p>

<p>Kolthunral is captained by Duchess Antheriss, one of Prince Caliburnus’
subordinates. She was a shadar-kai in life, and is now a Spirit Devourer.</p>

<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>

<p>Kolthunral uses the same principles as any Netherese flying enclave to stay in
the air, with a <em>mythalar</em> and everything. The thing that makes it atypical is
that it’s thoroughly militarized. Most of the inhabitants are soldiers, and the
rest are only here to work support jobs for the army.</p>

<p>The bottom of the flying island is encased in thick enchanted metal armor, and
the city has towers jutting out at all angles (even from the bottom) festooned
with siege and anti-air artillery similar to the engines used by Thay to defend
its borders.</p>

<h3 id="spatial-distortions">Spatial Distortions</h3>

<p>The interior of the fortress is partly made of shadow-stuff that warps and
distorts space, meaning it’s bigger on the inside and can actively misdirect and
confuse intruders. The same techniques were used to build its ultimate weapons,
the meteor tubes.</p>

<p>Meteor tubes are, well, straight metal tubes that connect the inside of the
fortress to circular hatches in its bottom armor. Their enchantments make them
“ritual paths” very similar to the Shadowfell Road. You drop a big rock through
the entry hole of a meteor tube, and it falls an unfathomable distance through
the weirdest and most inhospitable reaches of the Shadowfell, coming out the
exit hatch at a speed many times greater than terminal velocity. They’re hard to
aim precisely, but the kinetic energy of an impact is so big it can obliterate
everything within a few dozen yards.</p>

<p>A meteor salvo could flatten Surcross or Veil if it hit directly, but the
cities’ defenses have held so far. Surcross has a force field projected by its
five defense towers, and Veil has the Veil of Shadow that gives it its
name. This is the main cause of the current protracted siege.</p>

<h3 id="the-prison-of-night">The Prison of Night</h3>

<p>Kolthurnal’s prison is a large empty chamber where prisoners are held in place
by levitation magic near the center of the space. They’re stuck in place because
they’re too far away from the walls to push off, and the magic is too strong to
let them move by random thrashing. There’s only the one door, and it’s always
guarded, just in case.</p>

<p>This room is reserved for those the Shadovar judge might be useful in a future
hostage exchange, which to them means officers or members of “civilized
races”. Lower-ranking orcs, gnolls and undead are instead killed outright.</p>

<h3 id="movement-and-power">Movement and Power</h3>

<p>Kolthunral can fly at a leisurely ten miles per hour, and the only thing
limiting its maximum altitude is the fact that it’s not sealed against
vacuum. It could easily have flown over the plateau to attack the Thayan
heartland, but it’s actual goal is to stop the Thayans from using Shadowfell
Road. To do that it needs to destroy Veil and/or Surcross.</p>

<p>The fortress contains doors that are enchanted to become portals to the
Shadowfell when it passes over an area where the boundaries are
weak. Ironically, this means that it hovers over Veil whenever it needs to take
in new supplies.</p>

<p>The city’s mythalar power plant is stored in a nondescript tower near its
center. It’s a standard piece of Netherese tech. Destroying it would make the
city drop from the sky. There are actually rules for this!</p>

<p>Magical safety measures slow the city’s fall, but its mass is so high they can
only do so much, and only for a short time. This gives occupants (and PCs!) time
to evacuate, but they’re still in for a bad time if they fail to do so. And you
<em>are</em> supposed to give them a good chance to get out - the goal would be to
scare them, not force a TPK.</p>

<p>When the city hits the ground, effects depend on what its initial altitude was
when it started falling. If it was 100 feet or less, everyone inside takes
damage as if they had fallen that distance - the slowed fall speed is
counteracted by all the collapsing buildings. If it was higher, everyone inside
will be automatically squished.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>It looks like this region presents the PCs with a sticky situation. Kolthunral’s
goals align perfectly with their own, but both factions here are pretty
terrible. The group can side with one to defeat the other, but the victor will
get a significant boost back in Neverwinter. PCs who don’t want either of them
to win will have to defeat them both here in Thay.</p>

<p>I usually write about roleplaying games around here, but I just spend quite a
bit of time chasing down a weird computer issue and I want to write about it
somewhere to record the steps I took.</p>

<p>If you’re not a big Linux nerd, feel free to skip this. If you <em>are</em> and have
issues with how I did things, feel free to skip this as well. If you want to
read this anyway, I try to explain some of the basic concepts behind this
quixotic adventure in footnotes.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What Happened</h2>

<p>I run Ubuntu on my home desktop, and I currently updated to the latest release
version, 23.10. It was a small upgrade, as I was already running
23.04. Everything worked fine.</p>

<p>Then I saw <a href="https://youtu.be/Yi5LFtNTGrs?si=CaEw_fKJMYLh7191&amp;t=256">a video</a> with some news about version 545 of the nVidia drivers
being released. I was using 535, which again worked fine, but I heard that
545.29.02 fixed a lot of bugs and added some improvements I had been waiting
for.</p>

<p>These weren’t part of the official Ubuntu distribution yet, so I added the
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa">Graphics Drivers PPA</a> to my system, which did have them:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa

<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I installed the new drivers, tweaked my Firefox config to use Wayland<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and
tested the new setup with a Youtube video. I saw that the videos there remained
weirdly laggy, so I went back to X11 but decided to keep the new driver around
for its other improvements.</p>

<p>It worked quite well for games and everyday usage… but I noticed that my
Youtube videos were still weirdly laggy on X11, and that my computer was
getting quite a bit hotter while playing them than it used to. The “Stats for
Nerds” menu told me they were dropping more or less 50% of their frames, which
is <em>bad</em>.</p>

<p>A little investigation showed me that the Firefox browser did not in fact play
very well with that new graphics driver, at least not in the Snap version that
was installed by default on Ubuntu Linux<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It didn’t really “see” my video
card and so was sending all of its graphical work to the processor instead. It
already did this with videos, but now it was doing this for everything.</p>

<p>The easiest solution to this problem <em>by far</em>, would have been to go back to
version 535 of my graphics driver, the one I had before that worked just fine. I
could wait for this stuff to get fixed upstream without worrying about it.</p>

<p>This is not what I did.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did-instead">What I Did Instead</h2>

<p>I went spelunking into the depths of DuckDuckGo, looking for a way to enable
hardware-based graphical acceleration on Firefox. That would make it use my
video card both for displaying web pages and for playing video.</p>

<p>Firefox has been able to do this for a while now, but the option was only
enabled by default on Windows or in Linux computers with Intel graphic cards. I
have an Nvidia card with proprietary drivers, so I’m out of luck.</p>

<p>Firefox uses something called VA-API to talk to the video card when hardware
acceleration is on. On machines like mine the capability is forcibly disabled,
because those drivers don’t support VA-API. It’s possible to bridge the gap, but
the process for that seems to be a bit experimental still. Most people do not
have the time or inclination to worry about that, and are happier for it.</p>

<p>After some trial and error, this was the sequence of events that led me to
success.</p>

<h3 id="step-one-bridging-the-gap">Step One: Bridging the Gap</h3>

<p>A developer with the horrible user name of El Farto has <a href="https://github.com/elFarto/nvidia-vaapi-driver">a Github repository</a>
that contains the code for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvidia-vaapi-driver</code> a little wrapper program that
translates VA-API calls into something the Nvidia drivers understand and
vice-versa. The package is actually part of my default Linux distribution, but
since I’m on the 545 drivers I needed a more recent version straight from the
source. That’s v0.0.11, which has support for those drivers.</p>

<p>Following the excellent documentation in that repository, I did the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Compiled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nvidia-vaapi-driver</code> v0.0.11 from source and installed it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edited <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/default/grub</code> and changed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</code>
variable to the follwing:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"quiet splash nvidia_drm.modeset=1"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li>Edited <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/environment</code> and added the following environment variables to it:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME</span><span class="o">=</span>nvidia
<span class="nv">MOZ_DISABLE_RDD_SANDBOX</span><span class="o">=</span>1
<span class="nv">NVD_BACKEND</span><span class="o">=</span>direct
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I rebooted my computer, and found out the Snap version of Firefox didn’t
detect my video card. Whoops!</p>

<p>The next step was therefore to get rid of Snap Firefox in favor of the
traditionally-packaged version. Give up? Never!</p>

<h3 id="step-two-fox-replacement-surgery">Step Two: Fox Replacement Surgery</h3>

<p>First, I added the repository with the “traditional” packages for Firefox:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa
<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt update
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I added a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/apt/preferences.d/mozilla-firefox</code> with the
following contents:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Package: firefox<span class="k">*</span>
Pin: release <span class="nv">o</span><span class="o">=</span>LP-PPA-mozillateam
Pin-Priority: 1001

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This ensures that the PPA’s version is chosen over the Snap. The next step is to
remove the Snap and install the traditional package:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>snap remove firefox

<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt remove firefox

<span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-t</span> <span class="s1">'o=LP-PPA-mozillateam'</span> firefox
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since my user profile is in my home directory this preserved all of my bookmarks
and add-ons. Whew! And Firefox could now see my graphics card.</p>

<h3 id="step-three-chant-the-deep-magic">Step Three: Chant the Deep Magic</h3>

<p>The final step was to change some advanced browser configurations in the dreaded
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">about:config</code> screen.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gfx.webrender.all</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> -&gt; This lets it use the graphics card to
render web pages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> -&gt; for video acceleration</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">media.rdd-ffvpx.enabled</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> -&gt; This disables the built-in-software
codecs in Firefox.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gfx.x11-egl.force-enabled</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">widget.dmabuf.force-enabled</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> -&gt;
These are needed to get past the “hard blocks” imposed on the browser due to
its default configuration.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These take effect after I restart the browser. Finally, hardware acceleration
works! My computer heads up considerably less than it did, my videos in Firefox
have a buttery-smooth framerate, and I only had to battle a maximum of two Elder
Things to acquire the knowledge of how to do so.</p>

     Neon City Overdrive's cover.

<p>Neon City Overdrive is a game written by Nathan Russel and published by Peril
Planet Game Studio in 2020. This is the smallest core book of all the ones we’ve
seen so far at 72 pages.</p>

<p>We’ll also be looking at a supplement named The Grid, which focuses on hacking
and has another 60 pages.</p>

<h2 id="setting-overview">Setting Overview</h2>

<p>Most of those 132 pages are dedicated to the setting and to a set of adventure
seeds, both of which are largely based on <em>vibes</em> instead of relying on
laboriously crafted timelines or detailed maps. This is the game of stylish
cyberpunks running dangerous jobs in a neon-lit sprawl. The reader is expected
to take it from there to add details as needed.</p>

<p>The setting as provided is just a basic sketch. The game takes place in The
City, which is divided into dense residential and commercial zones called
Metroplexes, equally dense hellish industrial blocks named Grinders, and the
Streets that flow in between. The City and the world it’s in are covered by the
Grid, a global computer network where nearly every device that can be described
as “electronic” or “computerized” has a presence.</p>

<p>The Grid gets a somewhat more detailed description because I’m using material
from the supplement here. Like the physical world it has several components. The
Signal lets all those devices connect to the Grid. It’s maintained by an army of
antennas, and repeater drones. The devices attuned to the Signal generate The
Overlay, which is projected into the physical world as a combination of
holograms and augmented reality. Most devices have an augmented reality
interface instead of physical controls, and most signage exists in the Overlay
only. Hubs are big static computers. Some of them help route and maintain the
Signal and the Overlay, or host public virtual environments, but others are
private servers used by the sort of organization your cyberpunks need to hack.</p>

<p>You can use the grid through an interface that resembles a real-world smartphone
or desktop browser, but it’s also possible to go into full immersion VR. This
works as you’d expect if you’re familiar with the genre (and if you’ve read the
other entries in this series, you are). We have our Gibsonian matrix here, with
wireframe or low-poly graphics by default, but with specific hubs represented as
more realistic environments. The more powerful the owner, the more realistic
their hubs’ presentation.</p>

<p>A lot of social events happen entirely in the Grid’s virtual reality, from
important business conferences to sport tournaments and nightclub
gatherings. Virtual reality ensures they feel mostly like physical events. That
sure would have been handy during our real world pandemic.</p>

<p>The downside is that “common” grid users are constantly monitored and
tracked. Player characters and other dirty criminals have their ways of evading
this, and despite the efforts of law enforcement agencies and corporate
security, grid crime is very common and not going away any time soon.</p>

<p>When you go into VR, you emerge at the Local Area Zone corresponding to your
physical location but can move to any other LAZ you can access with a
thought. Movement within a LAZ is restricted to the sort of thing a real person
would be able to do in the physical world, and the landscape reflects this. Want
to go to a site in your LAZ? You need to walk. The book recognizes this is
inconvenient. Some area zones are private, either disconnected from the public
Grid entirely or separated from it by virtual gates that admit only those with
the proper credentials. A skilled enough hacker might be able to break through a
gate. Totally isolated networks can only be accessed by physically jacking into
their hubs.</p>

<p>People can access the grid using wearable computers, which are cheap and widely
available. Serious hackers (called <em>codeslingers</em> here) have an implanted
interface chip that has all the same functions and allows diving into VR as
well. Those who can’t or won’t use implants can make do with a “Grid-box”, a VR
helmet that also covers the mouth and nose. And both can further benefit from a
sensory deprivation chamber if they’re <em>really</em> serious.</p>

<p>This default presentation is subject to change, as GMs are encouraged to tweak
the arrangement to get the right vibe they want. By tweaking the list of
available technologies and how common they are you could get anything from
mainframes-and-telephones with a chrome veneer to a Ghost in the Shell-like
ubiquitous net where everyone has implanted computers.</p>

<h2 id="mechanics-overview">Mechanics Overview</h2>

<p>From what I understand the rules of Neon City Overdrive belong to the lineage of
Forged in the Dark games. There are <em>no</em> specific mechanics for the Grid here,
not even if you use the supplement. Hacking uses the exact same mechanics as
everything else.</p>

<p>Tests use six-sided dice. You start with one Action Die, and gain more for each
factor in your character sheet or the story that helps you succeed, and a Danger
Die for each factor that gets in the way. Then you roll the resulting pool. Each
Danger Die cancels an Action Die that rolled the same value. You take the
highest value rolled in the remaining Action Dice, and use it to determine the
result. A 3 or less is a failure, a 4 or 5 is a partial success with a cost
attached, and a 6 is a complete success. The book goes into a bit more detail
than this, but we don’t need it for this article.</p>

<p>Narration and the fiction it creates are <em>supremely</em> important because they’ll
set the stakes for the roll and inform you of which positive and negative
factors are in play to build your die pool. Players are the only ones who roll
dice. Enemies and obstacles are a source of Danger Dice but the GM never needs
to roll for them.</p>

<p>Hacking also uses those rules. The additional rules material in the Grid
supplement is just a clarification that purely physical traits and tags don’t
apply to tests made in the Grid, and Grid-specific ones don’t apply to the meat
world. Can´t use your muscle grafts to hack the Gibson, can’t use your fancy
programs to lift a car. Mental traits might apply to either “reality”, though.
The book encourages focusing on the imagery of the simulation and making it as
close to the physical world as possible, to make it easier for the group to
describe actions without needing to know a lot about computers.</p>

<h2 id="run-parameters">Run Parameters</h2>

<p>We’re supposed to set the exact shape of our Grid when we play, so let’s say
it’s more or less the same as Shadowrun 4th Edition’s. It’s not a pure mesh
network, there’s cell tower hubs and such, but it’s close enough for our
purposes.</p>

<p>Our hacker will be going along with the physical team. The target office’s Grid
layout is the same as in the SR4 version. The physical location surely has its
own set of tags but the one that affects us is that our good disguises give us
the <em>element of surprise</em>. Losing this might be one of the consequences for a
hacking complication here. In a real game that’d affect the rest of the team
too.</p>

<h3 id="target-systems">Target Systems</h3>

<p>We have an office intranet that’s connected to the general Grid through a
firewall, which we bypass by being inside the office. Its security from the
inside is <em>nothing special</em> except that access to the bank accounts is
<em>well-guarded</em>.</p>

<p>The internal security wireless network covers the office but not connected to
the outside. It’s <em>hardened against intrusion</em> and has a piece of Blue ICE
that will trigger at the first complication.</p>

<p>Our secret server in the records room with no wireless network at all. Our
hacker must physically jack into it. It’s also <em>hardened</em>, and has Black ICE
constantly watching over it.</p>

<h3 id="our-hacker">Our Hacker</h3>

<h4 id="pixie-non-binary-human">Pixie (non-binary human)</h4>

<p><strong>Trademarks and Edges</strong>: Metroplexer, Codeslinger (Hacking, Cyber Combat),
Infiltrator (Alarms, Locks)</p>

<p><strong>Flaws</strong>: Greedy, Socially Awkward</p>

<p><strong>Gear</strong>: Interface Chip (Fast, Advanced), Icebreaker (Silent, Deadly), Stealth
Program Suite (Mimetic, Subtle), something else non-hacking related.</p>

<p>Pixie is kinda min-maxed to fit our scenario, to be honest, with lots of traits
that would apply to hacking. They’re a passable sneak in the physical world but
not very good at physical combat and bad at social interaction. That’s what the
rest of the team is for.</p>

<h2 id="run-summary">Run Summary</h2>

<p>Our team gets into the office as usual - we always assume this part works
out. Pixie hides in the bathroom to find the security network and hack into it
via VR.</p>

<p>I decide to roll the security server hack as an extended task, since those
require three successes and we have three goals in here. Pixie decides to use
Infiltrator instead of Codeslinger for this, since it is an infiltration of
sorts and that’s where they put put their Alarms and Locks edges. I’m being
lenient towards my player (who is also me) here. Those traits plus all other
relevant tags give Pixie a total of seven action dice.</p>

<p>Pixie is opposed by a single danger die, from the server being Hardened, but
that die rolls a six and eats the one I rolled on the action dice. They’re left
with a 5 and a 4, which count as successes towards our goal but apply
consequences as well. So I rule we lost our Element of Surprise and that the
Blue ICE on the server activated.</p>

<p>I rule that the ICE hasn’t found Pixie yet, but it does get to add its relevant
tags as danger dice on the next roll as it looks for them. Fortunately none of
those roll a six and the action dice do, allowing Pixie to unlock the final door
ahead of time. Tests from this point on are made using Codeslinger as expected,
since they deal purely with stuff that lives in the computer.</p>

<p>We get to the secret server and I rule that the Black Ice in there is already
active but will only spot Pixie as a consequence - they start out stealthy. The
ICE however does get to add its Counter-Intrusion and Scary tags as danger dice
even so. Fortunately its rolls are crap and Pixie gets a 6, finding and
downloading the evidence.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s go for the money! This means the office network’s Well-Guarded
tag becomes a danger die, but as before the ice only comes online as a
consequence. We roll a 5 here, so it does come online, but not before we
transfer the money.</p>

<p>The physical team proceeds to try to leave the office, but as usual we stop our
simulation here since the main hacking bits are done.</p>

<p>Total elapsed time: 15 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="run-analysis">Run Analysis</h2>

<p>I love engaging with crunchy mechanics but narrative systems do have their
advantages! 15 minutes is the fastest time we have so far, beating the “silent
run” from SR 4th Edition by 2 minutes. And this only took so long because I have
absolutely no experience with Neon City Overdrive and had to keep looking at the
books.</p>

<p>It’s possible this run was too easy, but it’s okay because it’s inserted into
the larger context of the physical break-in. Pixie would have plenty to do in
that part of the run. I might have made a mistake here in simply having
“unaware” ICE add some of its tags to the hacking roll. The system is abstract
enough that I could have ruled slipping past the ICE undetected would require
“fighting” it and filling its Harm boxes while describing it as a sneaking
attempt. Whatever form it took in the narrative, combat would have made things
take longer, but not by much.</p>

<p>The mechanical bits of the run would probably be much faster than the 50/90
minutes I’ve been assuming here, but this would be offset in all cases by the
extended narration and roleplaying the game demands to frame those mechanics and
establish all the influencing factors for each roll.</p>

<p>Our experiment however does allow us to conclude the obvious: when you use the
exact same simple resolution mechanic for everything, everyone has more or less
the same spotlight time and the classic “Decker problem” won’t manifest.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/11/13/underwater-items.html">Underwater Dungeon Fantasy 2: Items and Artifacts</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>A while ago I posted a compilation of methods and tools for <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/07/11/underwater-dungeon-fantasy.html">underwater
adventuring</a>. In this post, I’ll add a few items and artifacts that further
help with that or that make sense as possessions for underwater people. This is
a grab-bag article without much direction, but I hope it will be useful
nonetheless.</p>

<h2 id="alchemical-pills">Alchemical Pills</h2>

<p>Any drinkable concoction (including magic potions) might be made as a solid pill
instead. Pills tend to be round, thumbnail sized, hard, and meant to be
swallowed whole. Pills are popular with alchemists and herbalists who don’t have
a line to a crystal vial supplier, and with underwater civilizations since
liquid potions don’t really work there.</p>

<p>A pill costs the same as the equivalent liquid potion. It’s waterproof and not
at risk of breaking from falls and the like, but it also can’t be put into
bandoliers for easy access during combat. Dry-swallowing a pill during a fight
requires either two Ready maneuvers or a single maneuver and a HT roll.</p>

<p>You <em>can</em> put each of your pills into a separately-purchased crystal vial (DF1
p. 111) in order to have them in your potion belt, but that does add an extra
Ready maneuver to the process of ingesting it since you have to open the vial
first.</p>

<h2 id="elixir-of-water-breathing">Elixir of Water Breathing</h2>

<p>This alchemical elixir can be found on GURPS Magic, and is “reprinted” here with
additional options. It’s a drinkable potion that lets you breathe underwater as
if you had Gills for 1d hours.</p>

<p>The GM rolls the die in secret when you drink it, and you remain unaware of how
long you have… until 5 minutes before that time expires, when you get an
instinctive mental warning that you only have 5 minutes left.</p>

<p>GMs who dislike the randomness can set a fixed duration based on how much they
want their PCs to spend on these potions. I suggest from 1 to 3 hours.</p>

<p>Purely aquatic people can instead get Elixirs of <em>Air</em> Breathing for the same
price and with the equivalent effect for air. Both variants are very likely to
be found in pill form (see above).</p>

<p>In all cases, the potion is $600, 0.25kg (0.5 lbs).</p>

<h2 id="coral-items-4-cf">Coral Items (+4 CF)</h2>

<p>Coral is a new implausible material: items made from it have a somewhat porous
texture but are covered in intricate natural patterns of bright colors. Coral
comes in rough or polished varieties, though both cost the same. Surfacers value
it because it’s pretty, underwater civilizations value it for its incidental
properties.</p>

<p>Coral items can be made without fire, though they do require special magic and
techniques known to underwater armorers. They also have neutral buoyancy: their
weight does not count towards Encumbrance when determining the user’s penalty to
Swimming. Anything that’s usually made of metal or wood can be made of coral
instead. Being made of coral adds +4 CF to the item’s total cost.</p>

<h2 id="artifact-atlantean-armbands">Artifact: Atlantean Armbands</h2>

<p>Origin: Divine.</p>

<p>This is a pair of gilded orichalcum armbands decorated with reliefs of sharks
and other marine creatures. The Atlantean Armbands were said to be a gift of the
gods to a human hero destined to become the queen of a great underwater
nation. That did indeed happen, and since all of the queen’s descendants were
born with the ability to live underwater the armbands became honored museum
pieces.</p>

<p>That ancient empire has long since fallen to the tides of history, so who knows
where these artifacts might surface next?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Sell Price</strong>: $50.000.</li>
  <li><strong>Weight</strong>: 0.5kg (1 lb) for the pair.</li>
  <li><strong>Power Item Capacity</strong>: 20 FP.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When worn (one in each arm), they allow the wielder to freely breathe and move
underwater as if they had the Gills and Amphibious traits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If used as power items, any FP from the armbands that’s spent on the Swim and
Breathe Water spells is worth double the energy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="variations">Variations</h3>

<p>Some legends tell of another pair of armbands, of silver-plated orichalcum and
decorated with land-animal motifs, that would allow an aquatic wearer to breathe
air and walk on land, assuming a humanoid form if necessary. These were created
by an evil but powerful witch for a mermaid that wanted to walk among humans,
and are Druidic in origin.</p>

<p>Instead of armbands, you could have rings, piercings, or amulets with the same
enchantments.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/11/13/neverwinter-thay.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: Thay</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The Shadowfell Road ends in Thay.</p>

<p>This is where the book technically breaks its promises. While every other place
so far has been presented as somewhere the party could go, the text here sounds
almost scared when it talks about the Thayan heartland because that’s where
Szass Tam and all his epic-level wizard buddies live. It makes it very clear
that the PCs should not go there.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the bulk of this section is not actually talking about the massive
plateau that makes up the Thayan heartland, but about the peripheral areas
surrounding that plateau. Special attention is given to Surcross and Veil, a
pair of fortified towns at its base, as well as to the Netherese flying fortress
that’s currently besieging them.</p>

<p>Veil is where the Shadowfell Road ends. Surcross is a short distance away and is
where all of Valindra’s supplies come from. The main reason the PCs would want
to come here is to disrupt that supply network in order to defeat her back in
Neverwinter. Depending on how the GM sets things up, it’s also possible her soul
vessel is hidden somewhere in Surcross.</p>

<p>The area around these two cities is a horrifying wasteland of destroyed nature
and abandoned villages whose ground is coated in bits of bone and flesh that
were too broken up to animate. We’ll take a look at the general area here, and
then zoom into the cities and fortress in future posts.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-thay">Overview of Thay</h2>

<p>In editions past, Thay used to be a slave-holding nation of evil wizards whose
schtick was over-specializing in one of D&amp;D’s schools of magic. Their ideology
was very similar to fascism with wizards at the top of the heap, but they tried
to present a more “friendly” face to the outside world, setting up trade
enclaves while keeping their dastardly schemes secret.</p>

<p>I believe the lich Szass Tam used to be a member of Thay’s ruling council, but
now he’s taken over completely and became its supreme leader. He turned Thay
into a “nation of undeath”, equally devoted to necromancy and conquest. Why
pretend to be friendly to other nations when you can just invade them and take
their stuff? The only deity whose worship Tam permits is Bane, the evil god of
conquest, and he’s suspicious of even that. Yes, worship of Vecna is completely
forbidden - I think Tam sees him as the competition.</p>

<p>Thay remains in this state when we switch to 5th Edition, by the way - it’s one
of the things they didn’t change back.</p>

<p>Climbing to the top of the Thayan plateau is discouraged not only by the book’s
scared tone, but by the many defenses placed around it. Its walls are almost
vertical and the only ways up are a set of narrow switchbacks that leave
characters exposed to artillery fire from both sides of the ongoing war.</p>

<p>Both Surcross and the Netherese fortress of Kolthunral have amazingly powerful
weapons and defenses at their disposal. Kolthunral’s mission is to cut
Valindra’s supply line by destroying Surcross and/or Veil, which is why it
hasn’t moved away. The PCs arrive to find them locked in a prolonged siege, as
neither is able to fully overcome the others’ defenses.</p>

<p>A significant portion of Thay’s forces are composed of undead, both at the grunt
and officer levels. Their living soldiers are mostly humans, orcs, and gnolls,
with plenty of spellcasters.</p>

<p>A character like the Renegade Red Wizard could be very helpful here if they
still have friends in the region, but they’re also coming back to the lion’s den
and if the Thayans realize the renegade is here they will be relentless in their
pursuit.</p>

<p>In addition to any friends of the Red Wizard PC that might be here, the area
also contains a bunch of spies and infiltrators sent by Dempharis Sibront, an
elderly Red Wizard who escaped Tam’s conquest of the nation. Sibront considers
himself nobility in exile and his network of infiltrated rebels is looking for
any way to weaken’s Tam’s hold on the country. The PCs can form an alliance of
convenience with him to fulfill their own goals, since they align, and his
forces will be genuinely helpful in that situation.</p>

<p>However he is likely to interpret this situation as the PCs agreeing to serve
him indefinitely, and could become an enemy in future adventures when he
realizes that wasn’t the case. That seems like an interesting opportunity for
continuing the campaign past the material in the book.</p>

<h2 id="the-charnel-fields">The Charnel Fields</h2>

<p>The horrifying plains of death in the area surrounding the two Thayan towns are
a product not just of the war, but also of Thayan fuckery. Since right after the
first battles, the Thayans started hauling corpses from the battlefield for
animation. But since some of those battles happened far away, they decided to
enact a “little” ritual to make things more convenient, using the blood of the
fallen as a focus.</p>

<p>Any corpse left on or under the earth within a hundred miles of Surcross will be
sucked by the enchanted soil and transported to an area near the city, where it
will be extruded to the surface. This makes it easy for Thayan necromancers to
haul them back for reanimation, and it also attracts all sorts of natural and
supernatural predators who want to feast on the remaining bits. The Netherese
have also started hauling corpses away from the charnel fields, to deny the “raw
material” to their enemies and maybe animate some of it themselves.</p>

<h3 id="relsforin">Relsforin</h3>

<p>The desperate inhabitants of this small village survived by making themselves
useful to Thay. They make up the bulk of the labor force that hauls corpses from
the Charnel Fields to Surcross, and in exchange receive some protection from
Netherese attacks. They fear the Netherese more than they resent the Thayans,
and if they think a group of strangers (such as the PCs) are likely to be
enemies of their masters, they will turn them in.</p>

<h3 id="echo-village">Echo Village</h3>

<p>This village belonged to the neighboring nation of Thesk until a short while
ago. The mercantile Theskans built it as a trade post near the Thayan border, to
facilitate commerce with the wizard nation.</p>

<p>Shortly after the war started the Thayans invaded the village and slaughtered
all of its inhabitants to turn them into more undead soldiers. They left the
village behind as an empty husk, but the angry ghosts of the inhabitants soon
appeared to haunt the place and wail about the hatred they felt for their
murderers. This attracted the spirits of <em>other</em> Thayan victims, turning Echo
Village into a sort of gathering point for ghosts with a grudge against Thay.</p>

<p>The ghosts’ default reaction to any living people approaching their village is
violence - they’ll attack while shouting rants against Thay. PC groups who are
perceptive and diplomatic enough might be able to figure things out from these
rants and convince the ghosts that they too are enemies of Thay.</p>

<p>This would ironically make Echo Village the safest refuge for the PCs in the
entire region, as the ghosts would allow them to stay while still attacking any
intruders. It’s an interesting contrast with Relsforin, which <em>seems</em> safe but
is not.</p>

<p>If the PCs then manage to lure the Thayan legion that contains the villagers’
original bodies back to Echo, the ghosts will be able to “repossess” their
bodies and turn against their commanders, potentially slaughtering the whole
legion. This will finally let them rest, and they will inform the PCs of any
sensitive information their bodies learned before moving on from the world.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Yikes! War crimes as far as the eye can see. It does put the events happening in
Neverwinter into context. GMs and players might be used to thinking of
heroic-tier campaigns as being “no big deal” in the grand scheme of things, but
everything that’s happening here in Thay is a B plot for the events in
Neverwinter.</p>
