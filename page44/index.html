<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>I first saw the Catoblepas in the AD&amp;D 2nd Edition Monster Manual, and I was
very surprised to learn it’s not a “lolrandom” original monster. It’s a
legendary creature from Ethiopia, described by Roman historians Pliny the Elder
and Claudius Aelianus. I can’t tell whether that makes it part of Ethiopian or
Roman folklore - I’m sure someone more qualified than me can make that
distinction. Their name is derived from a Greek word meaning “to look
downwards”. The plural of catoblepas is <em>catoblepones</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Wikipedia speculates that the original descriptions of the catoblepas might be
referring to a wildebeest or gnu, and you need only look at Wayne England’s
illustration above to know he’s really done his homework. A D&amp;D catoblepas looks
like a wildebeest with a horrible nightmare where its neck and head should
be. Their long necks are always bent down due to the great weight of their
heads, which is where their name comes from.</p>

<p>D&amp;D catoblepones are creatures of shadow and death. They are native to the
Shadowfell but have a natural ability to wander between worlds. People believe
they appear in places that are about to be stuck by tragedy, which is kinda true
since the beast’s breath and gaze are deadly. They’re associated with the Raven
Queen and sometimes show up as part of her entourage.</p>

<p>Despite their reputation as beasts of ill omen, catoblepones are often the
targets of hunting expeditions. Knights hunt them because defeating such a
dangerous beast brings great glory; others perform ritual hunts in honor of the
Raven Queen. Success in these ritual hunts might please the goddess enough that
she grants a blessing to the hunters. A catoblepas can be tracked by the trail
of destruction it leaves, and the Raven Queen is particularly pleased by hunters
who make an effort to mend this damage as they pursue their quarry. To them, she
might grand a mighty boon such as returning someone to life or giving a living
person the ability to foresse their own death and avoid it.</p>

<p>A slain catoblepas reforms in the Shadowfell after a while, and begins wandering
again. Their arrival in a region is often preceded by supernatural phenomena
such as hauntings.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>We get two varieties of catoblepas here.</p>

<h3 id="catoblepas-harbinger">Catoblepas Harbinger</h3>

<p>A classic beast of ill omen, the catoblepas harbinger appears in places full of
hubris to announce they’re about to be hit by famine, war, or other
tragedies. It feeds on pride, anger, despair and other negative emotions,
growing ever larger over time. The poisonous gases it exhales are a byproduct of
this vitriolic diet. I wonder if one of these showed up in the throne room of
the Nerathi emperor before the empire fell.</p>

<p>The Harbinger is a Large Shadow Beast, and a Level 10 Elite Controller with 220
HP. It lumbers along at speed 6 and has Resist Necrotic 5 and Blindsight 5.</p>

<p>Like all catoblepones, the Harbinger emanates the <strong>Raven Queen’s presence</strong>, an
aura (5) that causes anyone inside who fails a death saving throw to lose HP
equal to half their bloodied value. By the standard rules, any creature who hits
their bloodied value in negative HP dies automatically, so this aura makes PCs
die after <em>at most</em> two failed saves instead of the usual three.</p>

<p>When drawn into a fight the harbinger <strong>gores</strong> with its horns and uses its
<strong>poison breath</strong> (close blast 5, recharge 5+), which obviously does poison
damage and inflicts ongoing poison damage.</p>

<p>If someone within 5 squares of the harbinger willingly tries to move away from
it, they’re subject to the beast’s <strong>Final Glance</strong>, an opportunity action that
targets Will. A victim hit by the glance takes 5 necrotic damage and becomes
Vulnerable 5 to all damage (save ends). When they pass that save, they take
another 10 necrotic damage.</p>

<h3 id="catoblepas-tragedian">Catoblepas Tragedian</h3>

<p>This is an older specimen that usually hangs out in places where dead souls
cross over into the Shadowfell, absorbing all the negative emotions that
accompany them. This steady diet has made it grow much larger, and reshaped its
face so it looks like a tragedy mask.</p>

<p>Tragedians are Huge Shadow Beasts, and Level 18 Elite Controllers with 360
HP. They’re mostly identical to harbingers, with larger numbers. They also have
a couple of new abilities.</p>

<p>The first is a <strong>Withering Gaze</strong> used as an active attack against a bloodied
enemy. It targets Will, does a tiny bit of necrotic damage, and weakens (save
ends). After the first failed save, the target is also blinded. After the
second, the target’s hit points drop to -1. And yeah, this does mean they need
to make death saves and it does subject them to the Raven Queen’s Presence
aura. This power recharges whenever no enemy is affected by it.</p>

<p>The second new ability is <strong>Inevitable Call</strong>, a minor action that automatically
hits an enemy within 20 squares and pulls them 3 squares closer to the
Tragedian.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Catoblepones are sticky melee controllers. The basic Harbinger has good powers
to prevent PCs from getting away from them, opening them up from attack from the
other monsters in the fight. It pairs really well with monsters that can do
heavy damage, like brutes and some artillery, because you want to force the PCs
to roll death saves as soon as possible. The Tragedian is all that and more. It
has powers to draw PCs closer to itself and perhaps even force them into
negative HP early.</p>

<p>I used to dismiss these monsters outright because I found the name “catoblepas”
ridiculous, but their 4e incarnation has really evocative lore! I’m a fan now.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/05/22/cambion.html">Let&#39;s Read the 4e Monster Manual 3: Cambion</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Cambions made their 4e debut in the Monster Manual and were covered
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/07/25/cambion.html">here</a>. This MM3 entry brings us a few more cambion stat blocks, and an extra
helping of lore.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The basic lore hasn’t changed: cambions are the direct offspring of a mortal and
a devil. The first Monster Manual just described the mortal parent as “depraved
or foolish”, but MM3 gets into a little bit more detail on how that
happens. It’s about as horrific as you’d imagine.</p>

<p>The “foolish” mortals are the ones who sign infernal contracts. Many of them
include “make a baby” as part of the price. The “depraved” ones are cultists,
but that doesn’t mean the process is enjoyable for them either. The highly
hierarchical nature of Hell means mortal cultists and lesser devils must
conceive cambions as commanded by their superiors.</p>

<p>Whatever their origin story, cambions mature quickly and are soon put to work
furthering the schemes of their masters. Most of them swear loyalty to Asmodeus
directly and are set loose upon the world to enact various schemes. Fierna and
Belial also walk around with a cambion honor guard.</p>

<p>Cambions associate with lesser devils and mortal diabolists. Those who style
themselves as leaders might have a retinue of guards and advisors. The advisors
are sometimes oni or rakshasa, and in that case they’ll be the true power behind
the throne.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Cambions are Medium Immortal Humanoids with the Devil keyword. They have
darkvision and fire resistance (which is 10 in all stat blocks in this
entry). Their wings give them a flight speed of 8 (clumsy), which means they
fight with their feet on the ground.</p>

<h3 id="cambion-wrathborn">Cambion Wrathborn</h3>

<p>Despite the name, wrathborn are fairly subtle. They can use magic to appear as a
mortal version of their natural appearance, and they use this ability to
infiltrate mortal societies and attain positions of power through intrigue and
violence. They <em>do</em> have a short temper, though, and tend to interpret even the
smallest slight as a grave insult.</p>

<p>Wrathborn are Level 9 Skirmishers with 100 HP. Their disguise ability is named
<strong>Wicked Guise</strong>, and it remains on while the wrathborn is unbloodied. When that
happens, they assume their true form and project an aura (1) of <strong>Burning
Anger</strong>, which deals 5 fire damage to those caught inside.</p>

<p>They fight a bit like extra-mobile infernal warlocks, using a shortsword and a
wand. The basic sword attack is <strong>Pain Blade</strong>, which damages and makes the
target grant combat advantage for a turn on a hit. They can use a maneuver named
<strong>Path of Pain</strong> to shift 4 squares and make a Pain Blade attack at any point
during the shift. The wand shoots <strong>fire bolts</strong> that target Reflex and do fire
damage.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, while bloodied, the wrathborn can also use <strong>Burst Skyward</strong>
to deal fire damage around themselves (Close burst 2 vs. Reflex) and fly 8
squares without provoking opportunity attacks. This is good to avoid getting
surrounded.</p>

<h3 id="chained-cambion">Chained Cambion</h3>

<figure class="right">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-cambion-chained.png"/>

<p>Chained cambions are exactly what it says on the tin: cambions bound up in
chains, with iron masks affixed to their faces. I’m guessing this is what
happens when someone tries to imprison a cambion and it kinda-sorta breaks
free. Their bodies are completely bound, but they can move and fight by
controllng the chains that bind them. Their chief emotion is hate. The only
sound from behind the mask is a hoarse scream of rage. Zero subtlety. Zero
chill.</p>

<p>Chained cambions are Level 10 Controllers with 110 HP. Since they walk around by
moving their chains like spider legs, they lack a flight speed. They’re
surrounded by a <strong>Blinding Field</strong> (aura 3) that makes its covered squares count
as difficult terrain for enemies. Their <strong>Child of Chains</strong> trait makes them get
a +2 attack bonus when immobilized or restrained, as well as a +2 bonus on saves
to end those conditions.</p>

<p>These monsters attack by hitting people with their enchanted chains and
screaming into their minds. Their basic <strong>Chain Lash</strong> attack has a reach of 3,
and if it hits a dazed enemy it also immobilizes them.</p>

<p>The psychic screaming is expressed as two different attacks. <strong>Vile Fetters</strong> is
a reach 5 melee attack that targets Will and does psychic damage. If the target
ends it next turn closer to the cambion than it started, it becomes dazed (save
ends). <strong>Unfettered Scream</strong> (recharge 5+) is a close blast 3 that targets
Fortitude, does psychic damage, pushes 2 squares, and dazes (save ends).</p>

<p>As a minor action the chained cambion can use a <strong>Mind Shackles</strong> spell. It
automatically hits 2 enemies within 5 squares of the cambion. Shackled enemies
take 10 psychic damage at the start <em>and</em> at the end of their turns if they’re
not adjacent to the other shackled enemy at that moment. Each enemy saves
independently from the other, so it’s possible for one of them to be free and
the other still shackled. The first successful save reduces the damage to 5, the
second eliminates it. This power recharges when the cambion is bloodied.</p>

<p>Looks like a chained cambion will want to shackle a pair of enemies and then
keep them apart by interposing himself between then and using Unfettered Scream
to push them away, or Vile Fetters to prevent them from going around.</p>

<h3 id="cambion-infernal-scion">Cambion Infernal Scion</h3>

<p>Sometimes the unfortunate mortal forced to be a cambion parent is a noble or
even a monarch. Infernal scions are an object lesson on why hereditary
government is a bad idea. This one covets Asmodeus’ positition as the ruler of
Hell and is working to supplant him. I guess he’s still a ways away from doing
that.</p>

<p>He’s a Level 12 Elite Soldier with 250 HP, wearing mail and wielding a magic
sword. This <strong>Burning Longsword</strong> does fire damage and marks for a turn. If a
marked enemy tries to ignore the mark, the scion can use <strong>Majestic Stride</strong> to
teleport adjacent to them and hit them with the sword.</p>

<p>In addition to using the sword to mark people, the scion can use <strong>Oath of the
Nine</strong> (minor action, 1/round) to do so. This automatically marks an enemy
within 3 squares and gives them Vulnerable 10 Fire for a turn.</p>

<p>When not bloodied, the scion can use <strong>Dread Command</strong> (Ranged 5 vs. Will, minor
action, 1/round) to dominate an enemy for a turn. Once bloodied he flips out,
losing this ability and replacing it with <strong>Fiend Razor</strong>, which allows it to
make 2 sword attacks with an action. This is an interesting way to implement an
elite’s multi-attack ability.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Cambions are… okay I guess? The mechanics in this entry are interesting, but
the lore doesn’t quite get me going. I feel I can make some use of the infernal
scion, but the others don’t make stories jump to my mind just from reading them.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Beholders appear in every 4e Monster Manual and also in the Monster
Vault. They’re apparently too iconic to leave out! In this entry, we get spooky.</p>

<p>There’s no new “general” lore in this entry. Everything it introduces would be
packaged into the Monster Vault as well and we already looked at that lore here.</p>

<h2 id="beholder-spawn">Beholder Spawn</h2>

<p>D&amp;D 5th Edition would introduce that cool bit where beholders reproduce
asexually through nightmares. The MM3 just says that the means of beholder
reproduction are best left unknown. In either case, the result of that process
could be represented by this Beholder Spawn stat block.</p>

<p>These are beholders at the start of their life-cycle, very young and
comparatively weak but already quite smart and evil. You might find them
alongside their parents. Or perhaps they’re banding together for survival,
hoping to last long enough to be the first to reach full size and devour the
rest of their siblings.</p>

<p>In either case they’d be very aware of their fragility and would try to stay
mobile, spread out, and away from the reach of the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Beholder spawn are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts, and Level 15 Minion
Artillery. They have a flight speed of 6, darkvision, and all-around vision
(which means they can’t be flanked).</p>

<p>Like all beholders, they <strong>bite</strong> in melee and fire <strong>eye rays</strong> with a maximum
range of 10. Their rays are a lot simpler than that of a “full” beholder, and do
elemental damage of the same type as one of the types used by their parent.</p>

<p>If a spawn is hit or missed by a close or area attack, they can use <strong>Desperate
Flight</strong> as an interrupt to shift 2 squares. This means they can try to get out
of the area of effect before they suffer damage.</p>

<h2 id="beholder-eye-of-shadow">Beholder Eye of Shadow</h2>

<p>In past articles we already established that beholders mutate when they cross
over from the Far Realm, taking characteristics that match their new
environment. Eyes of Shadow are beholders that hung out in the Shadowfell too
long, acquiring powers compatible with that bleak place.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>We’re back in familiar territory here: this beholder is Large and a Level 12
Elite Lurker with 194 HP. It has the same speed and senses as the spawn above,
deals extra damage when it has combat advantage, and heals 20 HP at the end of a
turn if it has remained invisible since the start of that turn.</p>

<p>It capitalizes on those passive traits through a couple of auxiliary abilities:
its <strong>Central Eye</strong> (minor action 1/round) projects a fear attack that targets
Will and makes the target grant combat advantage; and it can <strong>Vanish Into
Shadow</strong> (recharge 5+) as a move action, teleporting up to 20 squares and
becoming invisible until it attacks or until the end of its next turn.</p>

<p>As for its actual attacks, there’s the usual <strong>bite</strong> and a set of 3 <strong>eye
rays</strong>. These are ranged attacks but don’t provoke opportunity attacks. The
beholder can fire two of them in the same action but must aim each at a
different target. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a <strong>Blinding Ray</strong> (vs. Reflex) that deals radiant damage and blinds for a
turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a <strong>Thundering Ray</strong> (vs. Fortitude) which deals heavy thunder damage and
deafens for a turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a <strong>Shadowbond Ray</strong> (vs. Will) that deals necrotic damage and immobilizes
(save ends). While this condition lasts, the beholder and any shadow creatures
in play have concealment while within 5 squares of the target.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This beholder wants to attack from ambush and use its central eye and blinding
ray to make the PCs grant it combat advantage from a distance. Then it’s going
to hit them with thundering rays and bites while enjoying the extra
damage. Shadowbond is for melee defenders, and Vanish Into Shadow is a good
escape hatch. The teleport range on that is so large it could allow the beholder
to escape combat entirely, though an overconfident or angry individual might
still return to the fight as soon as it finishes healing those 20 HP.</p>

<p>Its ability to target any defense makes it quite versatile, even if it only has
three rays.</p>

<h2 id="ghost-beholder">Ghost Beholder</h2>

<p>While the Eye of Shadow is merely goth, this one is actually undead. Beholders
are stubborn and hateful creatures at the best of times, so it’s natural that
some of them will linger on as ghosts after they die or are killed. This usually
suits them just fine, but it also makes the more cautious since they know they
won’t get a third chance at existence.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-2">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Ghost beholders are Large Level 18 Elite Controllers with 254 HP. It combines
common beholder traits (as seen on the two previous monsters) with undead
ones. It’s immune to disease and poison, and Vulnerable 10 to radiant damage. As
a ghost, it’s insubstantial and has phasing.</p>

<p>Its <strong>bite</strong> is a ghostly attack that targets Reflex and does necrotic
damage. Its <strong>Central Eye</strong> has a minor-action poltergeist effect that targets
Will, slides the target 5 squares, and gives if 5 vulnerability to necrotic and
psychic damage for a turn. All of its eye rays deal one of these damage types.</p>

<p>The ghost beholder has three <strong>eye rays</strong> to choose from. It can only fire one
on its own turn, but it also has the <strong>Eyes of the Beholder</strong> trait that gives
it a free random ray attack against enemies that start their turn within 5
squares of it.</p>

<p>The rays are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Chill of the Grave</strong> (vs. Fortitude) does cold and necrotic damage, and
slows (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ghostly Possession</strong> (vs. Will) inflicts 15 ongoing psychic damage (save
ends)e. The first failed save also dazes the target; the second one completes
the possession. Possessed targets are dominated, and the beholder disappears
from play until the effect ends. This happens on a sucessful save, or the
beholder can end it voluntarily.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Killing Thought</strong> (vs. Will) does psychic damage and forces the target to
make a melee basic attack against themselves! Targets who are not holding a
weapon will drop what they’re holding, draw a weapon, and make that attack
anyway, all as part of the same free action. Creepy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ghost beholders are fond of phasing into the floor or walls to protect
themselves from attack, emerging from unexpected angles to shoot against the
characters. Fighting them without access to force and/or radiant damage is an
exercise in suffering.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>More Beholders! Even though the Eye of Shadow follows the same naming convention
as the Eyes of Flame and Frost, I think it has a better stat block. It does a
variety of unexpected damage types and can target any defense!</p>

<p>The Ghost Beholder also has interesting abilities, but its defenses make it a
nightmare to fight for an unprepared party. Even well-prepared undead hunters
might boggle a bit when they find one of those instead of more standard monster
like a vampire or banshee.</p>

<p>As for the spawn, I’d probably reskin them into something else. The idea of
mobile flying artillery minions is sound, but the thought of fighting beholder
“children” is a bit disturbing and I’m partial to the idea that beholders spawn
as fully-grown nightmares given form.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Behemoths were introduced in the first Monster Manual. As you can see
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/13/behemoth.html">there</a>, they’re basically fantasy dinosaurs. Most of them resemble the
dinosaurs we learned about as kids, but the “official” association is tenuous
enough that behemoths don’t have to change to conform to newer scientific
developments.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The book gives us a couple of poetic paragraphs about how behemoth steps thunder
through the landscape and so on. They’re nice.</p>

<p>The new information here is that behemoths are always in demand for use as war
beasts, so specimens young enough to train are a hot commodity. Capturing one is
not easy though, because mommy behemoths fight their hardest when protecting
their nests and their young. Some of them also live in really hard to reach
places.</p>

<p>Even “tame” behemoths aren’t 100% safe. There’s always a chance they’ll flip out
and turn on their handlers, and then escape to the wild after killing them. This
<em>could</em> happen in the middle of a battle, in which case the behemoth will attack
enemy and former ally alike until it can run off.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>We get three new behemoth species here. They’re Natural Beasts as usual, and
since we have a focus on behemoths that can be used as weapons they all have the
Mount keyword in addition to the usual Reptile keyword. Their other traits vary
per stat block, and their levels range from mid- to late- Heroic.</p>

<h3 id="bone-crown-behemoths">Bone Crown Behemoths</h3>

<p>This is an old-school triceratops. I understand the science on those has moved
on by now, but this is one of the advantages of behemoths over realistic
dinosaurs. Their size is Large.</p>

<p>Bone crowns are herbivorous but extremely aggressive and ill-tempered. They’re a
favorite of hobgoblins and troglodytes, who train them for use as unstoppable,
tank-like cavalry. The “poetic” imagery in the text describes these things
charging through infantry formations and coming out the other side adorned in
soldier guts hanging from their crowns as if they were pennants. As you might
have guessed, they have a relatively high chance to flip out and turn on their
riders in the heat of battle.</p>

<p>Bone crowns are Level 6 Soldiers with 71 HP and Speed 7. Their basic (and only)
attack action is a <strong>Head Butt</strong> that damages and marks for a turn. When used in
a charge it also pushes 1 square, and when used in an opportunity attack it
knocks prone.</p>

<p>They also have a couple of triggered actions: <strong>Threatening Bash</strong> allows them
to attack a marked enemy that shifts as an interrupt. <strong>Insult to Injury</strong> is
their mount power, and adds their “push 1 square” effect to their rider’s
charge attacks.</p>

<p>Use pseudo-cavalry tactics for these: charge in from a distance, crash into the
PCs, and then stay around to step on them and pin them down while your
skirmishers and atrillery have fun. It’s better if the charge comes in from a
flank and hits the squishies, but since the PCs aren’t an army that’s difficult
to arrange.</p>

<h3 id="skinwing-behemoth">Skinwing Behemoth</h3>

<p>One of those giant pterodactyls. They nest in craggy mountains, and thieves
often try to steal their eggs to sell to kingdoms looking to start or maintain
an air force. A lot of these thieves get killed by enraged skinwing parents.</p>

<p>These Large behemoths are Level 7 Skirmishers with 79 HP. Their ground speed is
a pitiful 2 (clumsy), but they fly at speed 8 (hover). That clumsiness means a
downed skinwing will do everything in its power to take flight again as soon as
possible… even abandon its rider.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> with no special effects, but they have the
famous <strong>Flyby Attack</strong> power that allows them to fly their speed, make an
attack at any point, and not provoke opportunity attacks from their target. The
<strong>Strafe</strong> trait allows the rider to make a basic attack in place of their
mount’s bite during this maneuver.</p>

<p>The skinwing can also enhance a flyby attack with its <strong>Grasping Talons</strong>
(recharge 5+), which allow it to grab the target if the main attack hits. They
can then <strong>Drag Off</strong> the victim, carrying it with them while the grab
lasts.</p>

<p>Skinwings fight by doing constant flyby attacks, and carrying victims off to be
dropped from a great height when they can. Skinwing <em>cavalry</em> will coordinate
with ground forces to do the same thing in a maximally inconvenient way. PCs
would do well to knock them off the air as soon as possible and prevent them
from taking off again.</p>

<h3 id="spirehorn-behemoth">Spirehorn Behemoth</h3>

<p>I don’t think this Huge creature has an analog in the real world. At size Huge,
they’re so big they can mount platforms transporting up to a dozen people, and
they have big horns. They are the perfect vanity ride for your typical barbarian
chieftain or hobgoblin general, so there is high demand for eggs and even for
healthy adults. Lots of people die trying to get those.</p>

<p>Their actual battlefield use depends on the personality of their owners. Some
are used like thrones and sit in a palace somewhere. Others are mobile
fortified command centers that hang at the back of a fighting army. And others
are siege engines at the front lines, transporting troops instead of a single
big ego or command staff.</p>

<p>Spirehorns are Level 9 Elite Brutes with 234 HP. They confer the <strong>Beastmaster</strong>
trait to their rider, giving them a +1 to AC and Reflex. I guess only the person
actually directing the spirehorn gets the bonus. Their speed is 6.</p>

<p>A spirehorn’s basic attack is a <strong>gore</strong> with no special effects, and it can
make <strong>Double Attacks</strong>. Once per encounter it can build up some speed and
<strong>Trample</strong>, moving twice its speed. It can enter enemy spaces during this move
and makes a free attack on each enemy whose space it enters.</p>

<p>You’re likely to see these used in battle as living siege towers, or as carriers
for enemy leaders. In either case they’re going to be priority targets.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Dinosaurs are awesome even when they’re called Behemoths, and with the ones in
this entry plus the others we’ve seen before you have enough assemble a full
force organization table for a fantasy army that uses most of them in different
roles.</p>

<p>I think we even have enough “war beasts” at this point to make <em>themed</em>
armies. Here’s an example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Dragonborn use behemoths!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hobgoblins use mammalian megafauna, dire wolves, and giant bats!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elves use fey panthers and griffons!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dwarves ride dire boars!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kobolds use giant bugs!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Humans use horses and hippogriffs!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And everyone uses drakes because most of them are so common and easily tamed.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/05/19/cp-red-review.html">A Short Review: Cyberpunk RED</a>
        </h1>

<p>I remember buying the Cyberpunk 2020 core book around the mid-nineties. By then
it was already in its second edition. The first one was titled Cyberpunk 2013,
and it was released in 1988, making it the first actual cyberpunk RPG (Shadowrun
would arrive in 1989).</p>

<p>This system and its subsequent iterations remained mostly at the edges of my
awareness for a long time, since I was more of a Shadowrun fan. But recently I
started playing the Cyberpunk 2077 video game and I liked it enough that I
decided to also check out the latest edition of the tabletop game, Cyberpunk
RED.</p>

<p>The first thing I notice is that this is a <em>big</em> book. Nearly 500 pages in
length, I’m sure it would be quite hefty if it was a physical copy. The first
half of it is player-facing information starting with a setting overview,
character creation, basic rules, combat and finally netrunning. The second half
is a more detailed description of the setting, and then GM advice including a
series of short adventures.</p>

<p>When it comes to layout and presentation, R. Talsorian definitely learned from
its past mistakes with the ill-fated Cyberpunk V.3. Cyberpunk RED’s layout is
pretty clean, and its sans-serif font quite readable (to me at least). Page
margins have tastefully minimalistic decoration (done in red, of course) and the
illustrations are gorgeous and very detailed. Very little of the text is
obviously copied from CP 2020, surely another lesson learned from CP V3.</p>

<p>The mechanics are pretty much a new iteration of the Interlock system used by
CP2020. The basic numbers are tweaked a bit, but it should be pretty familiar to
anyone who played the earlier edition and pretty easy for newcomers to
learn. There are some useful artifacts from FUZION that managed to sneak into
the game, like the concept of “everyday skills” every character should know.</p>

<p>The combat rules are a bit simpler all around and should be fairly fun, but I
dislike that they do the “Martial Arts Thing” that was so common in a lot of
RPGs written in the 90s. You can be a pleb and learn Brawling, or you can learn
one of four elegant Martial Arts styles from the far and mysterious East! They
make your fists into registered lethal weapons and give you access to deadly
Secret Techniques! Bleh. I dislike the exoticism implied in this view.</p>

<p>Armor is really good compared to gun damage, and there is a very clear
“firefight meta” going on here. An unarmored character is going to go down
quickly, but it’s very easy to get concealable armor that will stop most bullets
at least 50% of the time. Practically every sample PC and opponent wears this
exact armor <em>and</em> carries the only handgun with a better than even chance of
getting through. The only ones who wear or carry anything lighter are those
enemies whose main distinction is having shitty gear, and those PCs for whom
combat is a tertiary concern.</p>

<p>The netrunning rules do a solid job of avoiding the pitfalls from the original
set. A hacking session is still a sort of mini-dungeon-crawl, but it’s a lot
more abstract and well-integrated into “meatspace” initiative. It also requires
the netrunner to be on-site, so that they can participate in the physical side
of the adventure with the rest of the group. My main criticism here is that
these rules remain very tightly coupled to their corresponding setting elements,
just like they were in CP2020. The new netrunning system comes accompanied by a
bunch of cataclysmic setting changes and a technical explanation that’s pretty
much just a word salad. Luckily this is extremely easy to eject.</p>

<p>The cyberware rules are essentially the same as always, though they carve a few
important and long overdue exceptions to the Humanity Loss rules. Still, I feel
they could have gone further.</p>

<p>As for the setting… I’ll be honest, I never knew there was so much backstory
and metaplot to it. I remember the setting section in CP 2020 as a sort of
“lightly flavored background soup” that was just there to explain why you had
cybered-up folks being all punky in this fictional city. CP RED decides to delve
way deep into it, with a huge historical section that serves as a stealth “2020
era” supplement before moving on to the 2045 narrative present of this
game.</p>

<p>While I think the narrative presents of RED and 2077 are both very interesting,
I have a lot of nits to pick with all that backstory and metaplot, and with the
ways it seems to remain static for a long time or loop over itself. Personally,
I’d probably move up its divergence point with the real world by a good 30+
years and condense a lot of the subsequent events up to 2077 into something more
dynamic and streamlined.</p>

<p>Proceeding to the GM advice, I finally find out where the copied text from
previous editions is this time. The first couple of pages in this section
reproduce a lot of advice I remember seeing from editions past. Some of it is
serious, some of it is a tongue-in-cheek parody, all of it feels very dated when
read in The Actual Year of 2022. Apparently the reader is supposed to easily
distinguish the real advice from the jokes, but in my experience that never
really works.</p>

<p>After we get past this bit of cringe, we get to advice on plotting
adventures. Though it talks in terms of “script-writing”, it does recognize
things will go off-script and that improvisation is essential. “Just roll with
it” is very basic advice but it’s still welcome.</p>

<p>The system for awarding XP at the end of each session recommends classifying
players according to their playstyles, and evaluating them based on how well
they stuck to that classification. The combat monster should get XP for fighting
well, the roleplayer for roleplaying well, and so on. I’d have been all over
this back when 2020 was still the distant future. These days, though, I don’t
want to have to tell Player A that they got less XP than Player B for failing to
live up to the way I think they should play. In my games, when someone does
something worthy of a XP bonus, <em>everyone</em> gets that bonus. We all lift
together!</p>

<p>Finally, just like in CP2020, there’s a section of “screamsheets”, two-page
spreads containing a handful of fictional news articles on the left and a
mini-adventure on the right. These are entertaining.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>It might seem like I’m complaining a lot, but I’d happily play Cyberpunk
RED. The system is simple and very playable, and most actual groups are likely
to care little about deep metaplot cuts. It’s a good game overall.</p>

<p>Speaking as a GM, I don’t think the CP RED system clears my personal “Treshold
of GURPS”. If I had ample time to prepare and plan, I’d probably adapt its
setting to that system. However I’d happily run the game as-is if I had to do it
on the spot. I’d just hand out the ready-made RED iconics as PCs, and pick one
of the short adventures at the back of the book.</p>

<p>In either case, if the setting’s timeline was important, I’d probably use the
hypotethical condensed version I mentioned earlier. And I’m definitely going to
ditch that advice that says a group of PCs can’t hope for anything more than
their own survival and maybe doing some small good beyond that. You don’t get to
say that and have a setting where Rache Bartmoss can take the whole NET and
quite a few megacorps down in one fell swoop, and where Johnny Silverhand’s
raids on Arasaka Tower are practically a regular event. If these clowns can have
that much of an impact, then so can any PC group whose players are interested in
this sort of game.</p>
