<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Quicklings have been around since AD&amp;D 1st Edition, where they appeared in the
Monster Manual II. Here, they appear only in the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Quicklings are wicked fast and just plain wicked. They’re little serial killers
who like to knife others for food, loot and sport. The last two mean they
definitely don’t restrict themselves to hunting animals.</p>

<p>Their preferred tactics are clever ambushes, and they do their best to never
stand still in a fight. Quicklings often ally with fey and other creatures that
share their proclivities, and I imagine they’re not above working as
mercenaries.</p>

<p>The 4e illustration is a lot more monstrous than the one in the AD&amp;D Monster
Manual II, which was just a little foppish dude. One interesting bit of lore in
1e is that quicklings might be brownies who delved too deep into forbidden
magics. You can certainly use that explanation if you want to, but it’s also
entirely appropriate for them to be their own species of Feywild nightmare
creature.</p>

<p>Speaking of that, Quicklings often leave the Feywild and stalk the world looking
for good “opportunities”. They’re highly intelligent and so might be down for
whatever evil scheme your villains are hatching this week even if they’re not
the main opposition.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two stat blocks for quicklings here. Both are Small Fey Humanoids with
low-light vision and a fantastic land speed of <em>12</em>. Their AC and Reflex are
also notably higher than the expected for their level.</p>

<h3 id="quickling-runner">Quickling Runner</h3>

<p>This Level 9 Skirmisher has 96 HP and all common quickling traits. It also gains
a further +4 bonus to AC against opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>The runner’s basic attack is a <strong>short sword</strong>, which it can also use in a
maneuver called <strong>Quick Cuts</strong>. This allows the runner to move its speed (12)
and make two basic attacks at a -2 penalty at any two points during the
move. This is an at-will attack, but it cannot be used while the quickling is
immobilized or slowed.</p>

<p>To bring the runner’s damage up to the new baseline, you need to either update
its base sword damage or remove the -2 penalty from the Quick Cuts
attacks. Quick Cuts is going to be its most frequent attack, and you should be
trying to move past the party’s front line and into the ranged squishies to
apply it. That +4 against OAs sure helps.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the quickling can perform a <strong>Fey Shift</strong>, shifting 10
squares as a standard action. It’s likely to use this to escape when it sees the
fight isn’t going in its favor. If this was a move action instead, it would be a
good initial maneuver to get to those squishies from ambush.</p>

<p>As a minor action, it can also <strong>Maintain Mobility</strong> (recharge 4-6), which
automatically ends any immobilization applied upon it.</p>

<h3 id="quickling-zephyr">Quickling Zephyr</h3>

<p>Not just a higher level runner, the Zephyr is a bit more subtle. It’s a level 14
lurker with 82 HP and all common quickling traits. It also fights with a <strong>short
sword</strong> which is even more in need of a damage update than the runner’s.</p>

<p>As a move action, the quickling can use <strong>Blinding Speed</strong> (recharge 4-6) move
its speed and become invisible, which lasts for a turn or until it attacks. It’s
a cheap way of getting combat advantage, despite not being always available. The
zephyr’s <strong>Unstoppable</strong> trait allows it to ignore all difficult terrain and to
run across any solid or liquid surface, so it can be safely employed in the
gnarliest of maps.</p>

<p>If it attacks with combat advantage, the zephyr deals some additional sneak
attack damage, though that would also need a boost to be in line with the new
math.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We get a single level 9 sample encounter: 1 quickling runner, 1 eladrin twilight
incanter, and a feymire crocodile.</p>

<p>Going by lore and level, quicklings should also be able to work well with
banshrae, lamias, hags, and the occasional ogre, troll, or oni.</p>

<p>The stat blocks we’re given do roughly half the damage the new math says they
should, but once you update them they’re quite usable. The quickling’s speed can
certainly be played up for a bit of horror. “You see a quickling in the
distance. You blink and it’s right next to you, its sword already in your
spleen.”</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/09/25/purple-worm.html">Let&#39;s Read the 4e Monster Manual/Vault: Purple Worm</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Purple Worms have been in D&amp;D since at least the days of BECMI, and are likely
inspired by the sand worms of Frank Herbert’s Dune. They’re in both the Monster
Manual and Monster Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Believe it or not, purple worms were not created by some drug-addled wizard or
vengeful primordial. They’re entirely natural creatures, just like cats and
dogs. Or drakes. Or behemoths. Or bullettes. Yeah, the world of D&amp;D is kind of a
dangerous place.</p>

<p>Large enough to swallow a giant whole, purple worms burrow through the Underdark
and through rocky and mountainous terrain on the surface. They’re not always
hungry, but their feeding strategy is gorging themselves about once a week so
the end result is more or less the same. They’re such efficient tunnelers that
you can’t tell they’re coming until they’re almost directly underneath you. They
also have a knack for showing up precisely when people think things can’t get
any worse. Large Underdark settlements are always protected by a perimeter of
anti-worm wards, and when these settlements war with each other sabotaging those
wards is a popular move.</p>

<p>Unlike the Dune sand worms, purple worms can burrow through solid rock just
fine, and in addition to their cavernous maws some have a venomous stinger on
the tip of their tails. They dig by eating the rock or soil and quickly
excreting it, though stuff like refined metal, precious ores and gems have a
tendency to stick in the worm’s gut for longer periods. So if you manage to kill
one, its gut may contain treasure!</p>

<p>Purple worm tunnels are very large and permanent, and they don’t reuse
them. An area rich in food might have several purple worms hunting it, and will
end up looking like a labyrinth. Worm tunnels tend to become important natural
roads in the Underdark, and it’s not uncommon for smaller creatures to move into
them right after the worm passes them by. Instant ecosystem!</p>

<p>These beasts are impossible to tame, but people keep trying to use magic to
control them. Drow and illithids can’t resist their potential as a weapon, and
dwarves can’t resist their potential as a construction tool. I mean, a purple
worm could likely have dug the tunnel under the English Channel in a fraction of
the time the real-world construction crew took.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s pretty much inevitable that these spells will wear off at the
worst possible time, leading to disaster. After digging the tunnel, that same
purple worm would have likely delivered a much quicker and less painful Brexit
by eating Britain.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-manual">The Numbers (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>Purple Worms are Natural Beasts with the Blind keyword. They have both
tremorsense 20 and blindsight 10, plus a respectable burrow speed with
Tunneling. We have two stat blocks here.</p>

<h3 id="purple-worm">Purple Worm</h3>

<p>The basic model is Huge, and a Level 16 Solo Soldier with 780 HP. As a blind
creature, it’s immune to gaze attacks, and also immune to illusions. It crawls
at speed 6, and burrows at speed 3.</p>

<p>The worm’s basic attack is a Reach 3 <strong>Bite</strong> that, unlike most basic attacks in
the book, targets Reflex. No amount of armor is going to protect you from it!  A
hit does damage and grabs the target (Athletics DC 34 or Acrobatics DC 30 to
escape).</p>

<p>Once the worm has grabbed a target, it can “worry” it with its <strong>Clamping
Jaws</strong>, which has the same accuracy vs. Reflex and damage as a basic bite but
does half damage on a miss.</p>

<p>It can also try to <strong>Swallow</strong> them. This targets the Fortitude of the
victim. On a hit, the target gets swallowed and is now inside the purple
worm. The victim is considered dazed and restrained, and only has line of sight
and effect to the worm. Also, no one has line of sight or effect to the victim.</p>

<p>While swallowed, the victim can only make basic attacks, and takes 10 physical
and 10 acid damage at the start of the worm’s turns. The only good news here is
that the worm’s AC is like 8 points lower from the inside. The only way to
escape is to kill the worm, which causes the victim to be regurgitated.</p>

<p>The worm can’t bite other people while it has a target grabbed in its jaws, but
it can fight normally after swallowing. There’s no mention of how many victims
fit in its gullet. “One” is the merciful answer, but “1 Large or 2 Medium or 4
Small” is traditional.</p>

<h3 id="elder-purple-worm">Elder Purple Worm</h3>

<p>Elder Purple Worms have grown to size Gargantuan (the largest possible under the
rules). They’re large enough to swallow titans! Elders are Level 24 Solo
Soldiers with 1145 HP and the same immunities as the younger specimen. Their
land speed is 8 and their burrowing speed 4.</p>

<p>The elder’s attacks are exactly the same as those of the basic worm, with bigger
numbers. Their AC is 7 points lower from the inside, and their digestive damage
is 20 physical and 20 acid per turn. Again there’s no mention of how many
creatures fit in the worm’s gullet. The traditional answer would be “1 Huge or 2
Large or 4 Medium or 8 Small”, but it might be a tad unfair to allow it to
swallow the whole party.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-vault">The Numbers (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>Purple worms in the Vault are fairly different, and generally more adequate for
use as solo encounters. We also get two stat blocks, and both are Huge Natural
Beasts (blind).</p>

<h3 id="adult-purple-worm">Adult Purple Worm</h3>

<p>Adult Purple Worms are Level 14 Solo Brutes with 560 HP. Not sure if I
mentioned this before, but the new monster math also gives solos less HP. Their
tremorsense and blindsight are both range 10, and they both crawl and burrow at
speed 6.</p>

<p>As a MV Solo, this worm has some traits that help it stand up to a paragon
party: <strong>Ponderous</strong> allows it to take immediate actions while stunned, dazed,
or dominated; and <strong>Bloodied Frenzy</strong> allows it to take an extra minor action in
its turn while bloodied.</p>

<p>The basic Reach 3 <strong>Bite</strong> now targets AC, and has no riders to its considerable
damage. All the gizzard gimmicks are now packed into the <strong>Devour Whole</strong> attack
(Melee 3 vs. Fortitude). A hit here does similar damage to a bite and swallows
the target.</p>

<p>Being swallowed here is a little less nightmarish than for the MM version. The
restrictions on line of sight and effect still apply, and the victim is off the
board and so obviously can’t move around. However, they are no longer dazed or
restrained, and can use any of their attacks against the worm. They can even try
to crawl out of its gullet as if escaping from a grab, rolling against a lenient
DC of 21.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the worm’s defenses are the same from the inside
now. Swallowed victims take 30 acid damage at the end of their own turns, and
any close or area attacks used from inside the worm also target all other
creatures swallowed by it. While we still get no word on what’s the limit for
those, we do have explicit confirmation that there can be more than one. So you
can choose between the traditional answer and “no limit”!</p>

<p>This worm also has a lot of other options to bring pain to the party, all of
them minor actions. <strong>Fling</strong> (Melee 3 vs. Fortitude) deals damage and slides
the target 4 squares; <strong>Regurgitate</strong> spits out a swallowed victim, making it
appear within 4 squares of the worm and take a chunk of automatic damage; and
the <strong>Poison Stinger</strong> (Melee 3 vs. Fortitude)  mentioned in the Lore section
does a bit of physical damage and 15 ongoing poison damage (save ends). With
Bloodied Frenzy active, it can do all three and still swallow someone.</p>

<p>You also have <strong>Thrash</strong>, a reaction that triggers whenever an attack hits the
worm. It’s a Melee 3 attack vs. Reflex, targeting one or two creatures, doing
the same damage as the bite and pushing them up to 6 squares. This is why it has
Ponderous!</p>

<h3 id="purple-worm-tunneler">Purple Worm Tunneler</h3>

<p>This specimen is quite a bit faster, and likely the one you want to use for your
Eurotunnel/Brexit combo. It’s a Level 19 Solo Skirmisher with 728 HP. Its land
and burrow speeds are 8.</p>

<p>The tunneler has the same Ponderous and Bloodied Frenzy traits as the basic
model. Its <strong>Bite</strong> does damage and allows it to shift half its speed on a
hit. <strong>Devour Whole</strong> also works the same, with an escape DC of 24.</p>

<p>As a move action, the tunneler can <strong>Barrel Through</strong> its foes, shifting its
speed and making an attack against the Reflex of every enemy it passes adjacent
to. A hit here does a bit of damage and pushes the target 2 squares.</p>

<p>The tunneler also has a bigger stinger, since its minor-action attack is
<strong>Stinger Impalement</strong> (Melee 3 vs. AC). This does more physical damage than the
basic worm’s stinger, slides the target 4 squares, and deals 10 ongoing poison
damage (save ends). There’s no limit to the number of times per round it may do
this, so you’re looking at up to three impalement attacks plus a devouring when
the worm is bloodied.</p>

<p>Finally, it also has <strong>Thrash</strong>, which works the same way with bigger numbers.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The Monster Manual has a level 18 sample encounter: 1 purple worm, and 2 savage
minotaurs.</p>

<p>Purple worms don’t cooperate with anyone, of course, but they’ll often be
attracted by fights against other monsters and try to eat everyone present, just
like Bullettes but on a bigger scale. In other words, purple worms are just the
thing to use on a party who’s all happy that they’ve outgrown bullettes.</p>

<p>I like purple worms! I don’t think they’re exclusive content, but they’re still
a very D&amp;D kind of monster. In previous editions I kinda felt they suffered from
the same problem as dragons, looking so powerful that people rarely put them in
their games. Here, I have a better handle of when they’re appropriate.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Panthers are real-world animals, and something like them has been in the game
since the beginning. In 4e, they’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>This is another one of those Monster Manual entries that focuses on fantastical
versions of a mundane animal. The implied setting of D&amp;D does have mundane
panthers, but the book notes that they mostly hunt small game and avoid contact
with people.</p>

<p>However, that setting also has <em>supernatural</em> panthers touched by the energies
of the Feywild and Shadowfell. These are larger, stronger, and have no problem
stalking humanoids that blunder into their hunting grounds. They have powers
that are thematic to their home planes, and can move between them and the world
at sunrise and sunset.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two stat blocks here, one each for fey and shadow panthers.</p>

<h3 id="fey-panther">Fey Panther</h3>

<p>This is a Medium Fey Beast, and a Level 4 Skirmisher with 54 HP. It has trained
Perception and low-light vision, and moves with a ground speed of 8 and a climb
speed of 6.</p>

<p>The fey panther’s basic attack is a <strong>Bite</strong> that also allows it to shift 1
square on a hit. Its <strong>Charging Pounce</strong> ability allows it to deal extra damage
and knock the target prone on a charge.</p>

<p>Finally, it can also use <strong>fey step</strong> like an eladrin, teleporting 5 squares
once per encounter.</p>

<p>These abilities add up to a fighting style where the panther tries its best to
not stay engaged with a single target, using the shifts from its basic attack
and the teleport from Fey Step to make sure it’s always in position to charge
someone without receiving opportunity attacks.</p>

<p>If you really want a mundane panther, you could remove Fey Step from this one
and maybe lower its level to 3.</p>

<h3 id="spectral-panther">Spectral Panther</h3>

<p>Real-world black panthers are jaguars with a specific gene that makes them all
black. D&amp;D black panthers come from the Shadowfell!</p>

<p>Spectral panthers are Medium Shadow Beasts, and Level 9 Lurkers with 76 HP. They
run at speed 7, and oddly seem to lack a climb speed. They have trained
Perception and low-light vision.</p>

<p>Their name comes from the ability to assume a <strong>Spectral Form</strong> as a standard
action, which turns them insubstantial and gives them a +5 bonus to Stealth
(bringing the total up to +19), but makes their attacks deal half damage. Once
in this form, they can use another standard action to turn <strong>Invisible</strong>. Both
conditions can be ended as a free action, and invisibility also ends when the
panther makes an attack.</p>

<p>They attack with their <strong>Claws</strong>, and when an enemy moves or shifts into an
adjacent square they can also use a <strong>Tail Spike</strong> as a reaction. Both attacks
deal extra damage if the panther has Combat Advantage against the target.</p>

<p>Overall, the spectral panther is slightly sub-par as a lurker, because it takes
two turns to become invisible and the combat advantage bonus damage isn’t big
enough to make up for that. You’re probably better off sticking to
insubstantiality for repositioning, and relying on flanking and such to get
combat advantage. Or you could change <strong>Spectral Form</strong> so it makes the panther
invisible right away.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have a single sample encounter here, along with the usual statement that lots
of intelligent humanoids end up keeping supernatural panthers as pets and attack
animals.</p>

<p>The encounter is level 9: 2 spectral panthers, a dark stalker, and a pair of
shadar-kai warriors.</p>

<p>Panthers are… okay, I guess. Their existence is a cool bit of color, but they
don’t make immediately want to use them in an encounter like other monsters here
did.</p>

<p>Owlbears have been in the game since at least BECMI, and likely since the
beginning. As another rather popular and iconic monster, they are both in the
Monster Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Owlbears are dangerous predators that originated in the Feywild but spread to
the world ages ago. They have the strength of a bear, the cunning of an owl, and
are always hungry.</p>

<p>The creature’s owl bits give it excellent night vision, better talons than what
you usually find in a bear, and a characteristic hooting call. Their fey nature
also means they have magic powers, which can vary with their specific
environment but always include something related to their hoots. Owlbears get
together to mate and rear their cubs, usually only sticking around only long
enough to accomplish that. If prey is plentiful, they might stay together
longer.</p>

<p>Any creature that crosses an owlbear’s territory is fair game. Some owlbears
drag the carcasses of their prey back to their lairs and hang the leftovers on
nearby trees and bushes in hopes of attracting scavengers who will serve as
future meals.</p>

<p>Owlbears are difficult, but not impossible to tame. All manner of fey, goblins,
and even giants might take them as guards, attack animals, or simply pets. In
fact, with the Fey Beast Tamer theme introduced in the guide to the Feywild, PCs
can also have their own pet owlbears!</p>

<p>Some of the fey skip all the boring animal handling work and use charm spells -
it’s the GM’s call whether that’s a prudent thing to do.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-manual">The Numbers (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>Owlbears are Fey Beasts with average Int score of 2. They have a ground speed of
7, low-light vision with trained Perception. Their attacks are usually with
their claws and beaks, though each variety has a different magic
hoot/screech/call as well.</p>

<p>The MM varieties, as usual, need a damage update.</p>

<h3 id="owlbear">Owlbear</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Level 8 Elite Brute with 212 HP and size Large. Its basic
attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Claw</strong>, and it can make two of those per standard
action. If both hit, the target is grabbed (escape DC 19 for Acrobatics or 22
for Athlethics).</p>

<p>The owlbear can <strong>Bite</strong> a grabbed target, hitting automatically for enough
damage that even without an update it’s close to what it should be for a limited
attack. It’s a standard action but it’s definitely worth it.</p>

<p>When first bloodied it will emit a <strong>Stunning Screech</strong> as a free action. This
is a Close Burst 1 vs Fortitude which does no damage but stuns on a hit (save
ends). Don’t cluster around it!</p>

<h3 id="winterclaw-owlbear">Winterclaw Owlbear</h3>

<p>This Huge owlbear is likely adapted to live in regions of supernatural winter in
the Feywild. Instead of relying on pure physical power, it uses innate ice
magic. It’s a Level 14 Elite Controller with 280 HP.</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>Winterclaw</strong> that does a mix of physical and cold
damage, and slows on a hit (save ends). It can make two of those per standard
action, and if both hit the target is immobilized (save ends) with a slow
aftereffect (save ends).</p>

<p>Its magic call trick is the <strong>Frost Wail</strong> (close burst 3 vs. Fortitude), which
does cold damage and immobilizes (save ends). It recharges when the owlbear is
first bloodied.</p>

<p>With a winterclaw owlbear you’ll want to keep everyone immobilized and
preferably isolated, allowing the other monsters in the encounter to pick the
PCs off one by one.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-vault">The Numbers (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>The main difference from the Monster Manual here is that the owlbear’s low-light
vision has been upgraded to full Darkvision. They also have properly updated
damage.</p>

<h3 id="young-owlbear">Young Owlbear</h3>

<p>Essentially a non-elite version of the basic Owlbear, it’s a Level 8 Brute with
106 HP. It fights in exactly the same way, and even has the ability to make two
attacks per turn and grab if both hit.</p>

<p>Its hoot only dazes instead of stunning (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="owlbear-1">Owlbear</h2>

<p>A straightforward update of the MM version. Still a Level 8 Elite Brute with 212
HP, its damage has been updated but no other changes were made.</p>

<h2 id="trained-owlbear">Trained Owlbear</h2>

<p>This Large owlbear likely represents a beast that has been tamed and trained
since hatching. It lacks that primal vigor of the wild variety but has better
teamwork.</p>

<p>Trained owlbears are Level 9 Soldiers with 96 HP. They mostly fight with Reach 2
<strong>Claws</strong> but have a few other tricks.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Thunderous Shrieks</strong> (Close Burst 2 vs. Fortitude; recharge 5-6) do
thunder damage and knock prone on a hit. If an adjacent enemy makes an attack
that doesn’t include the owlbear as a target, it will use a <strong>Guardian Claw</strong> to
attack them as an opportunity action. This deals the same damage as a basic
attack, or a flat 5 damage on a miss.</p>

<p>So these owlbears will run right into the fray and occupy the attention of the
enemy front-line, while their masters further back use magic or ranged
attacks. Pretty straightforward soldier types, though they’ll keep some space
between themselves to avoid friendly fire with the thunder shrieks.</p>

<h2 id="wind-claw-owlbear">Wind-Claw Owlbear</h2>

<p>Likely a subspecies that’s adapted to living in windy mountain passes or similar
environments. They’re Level 11 Elite Controllers with 228 HP.</p>

<p>Wind-claws are surrounded by a <strong>Keening Gale</strong> aura 2 that causes any enemies
ending their turn inside to take 5 damage, and allows the owlbear to slide them
2 squares.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Wind Claws</strong> do physical damage, slide the target 2 squares, and knock
it prone. On a miss the owlbear can still slide the target 1 square.</p>

<p>The ability that lets them attack twice is named <strong>Disembowel</strong> (it’s just
“Double Attack” for everyone else). If both attacks hit, the target is stunned
for a turn. I suppose this would be a literal disemboweling if the target hits 0
HP, otherwise they’re just momentarily stunned at narrowling escaping a
disemboweling.</p>

<p>This owlbear also has a <strong>Beak Snap</strong> that hits a grabbed target automatically,
but it lacks any abilities that grab the target! You can either add this ability
to one of its existing attacks, or use the default Grab attack everyone gets
(vs. Reflex, a hit does no damage but grabs the target).</p>

<p>When the owlbear is first bloodied, it lets loose a <strong>Wind Howl</strong> (close blast 5
vs. Fortitude). A hit does no damage, but pushes the targets 3 squares and
knocks them prone. A miss still pushes them 1 square.</p>

<h3 id="winterclaw-owlbear-1">Winterclaw Owlbear</h3>

<p>This is a straightforward update of the MM Winterclaw Owlbear, with the same
level, the same abilities, and updated damage.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: 1 owlbear, and a trio of satyrs. These would definitely go the “charm
spell” route for taming the owlbear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: 1 winterclaw owlbear and 3 cyclopes. These would tame them through
unceasing toil, for that is the cyclops way.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I love owlbears! Like otyughs, they’re one of those monsters that are a sure
sign that you’re in a D&amp;D world as opposed to some other fantasy setting. And
sure, they’re dangerous predators in-setting, but there’s something extremely
funny and even cute about the concept of a bear with an owl’s head that goes
“who?”.</p>

<p>Mechanically, they seem to do their job so well that the Monster Vault didn’t
change the original stat blocks at all aside from the damage update.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Otyughs have been in the game since at least AD&amp;D 1st Edition, and are probably
the game’s most unintentionally iconic monster. Fourth Edition leans into this
iconic status and features them in both the Manual and the Vault.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Otyughs are large, strange-looking beasts who feed on rotten organic
matter. They love to hang out in dark places where such matter is plentiful,
like fetid swamps, middens, sewers, mass graves, and so on. I think some
editions make them sapient, but here they’re mostly just animals.</p>

<p>These beasts behave like ambush scavengers, something which you don’t find often
in the real world. They bury themselves in mounds of filth, or submerge
themselves in pools of tainted water and such. Their central tentacle contains
their eyes and nostrils, so they use it to peek at their surroundings. They
strike with their other two clawed tentacles at any unlucky creatures that pass
by, kill them, and add them to the pile to wait until their flesh is rotten and
good for eating. They will also eat whatever rot was already there, of course.</p>

<p>You can’t really tame an otyugh, but lots of people use them as natural garbage
disposals because if you put them in your middens or sewers they’ll happily stay
there. Less scrupulous people also use them as security systems, since they’ll
attack any smartass adventurers who think they can invade your dungeon through
its sewers.</p>

<p>There’s a small danger here, which is that if an otyugh’s trash pile doesn’t get
renewed fast enough the thing will wander off in search of another. I imagine
this isn’t a problem for a sewer in active use, but an “artificial” pile meant
to house a guardian otyugh would need maintenance.</p>

<p>Otyughs aren’t very fast, but their brown mottled hides are excellent camouflage
for their chosen habitat, their tentacles are strong and dangerous and, well,
they smell like shit. It’s hard to handle a sword when you’re trying to hold
your lunch in.</p>

<p>They also have a propensity to mutate, acquiring a coloration and perhaps other
properties in line with its specific chosen environment. This makes them
suceptible to external mutating energies as well, such as those of the Far Realm
(or a Cocaine Wizard’s privy).</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-manual">The Numbers (Monster Manual)</h2>

<p>The MM only has one <strong>Otyugh</strong> stat block. It’s a Large Natural Beast, and a
Level 7 Soldier with 82 HP. It has Darkvision and trained Perception, a land
speed of 5 and a swim speed of 5. It’s immune to disease, and it pretty much has
to be.</p>

<p>Otyughs are also trained in Stealth, and have a trait called <strong>Spying Eye</strong> for
the eye-tentacle trick described in the Lore section which gives them a +10
bonus to Stealth when immersed in filth. This elevates its total bonus to +18,
making it challenging to spot even for the party radar at equivalent levels.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Otyugh Stench</strong> is an aura 1 that inflicts a -2 attack penalty on any
living enemies inside. It will mostly attack with its <strong>Tentacles</strong>, which are
Reach 3, pull the target 2 squares and grab on a hit in addition to doing
damage. By MM rules, the escape DC is 22 for Athletics and 16 for Acrobatics,
due to the large disparity between the otyugh’s Fortitude and Reflexes.</p>

<p>Against adjacent targets the creature can use its <strong>Diseased Bite</strong>, which deals
a little more damage than the tentacle and cause the target to contract filth
fever.</p>

<p>This is standard Filth Fever, not a specific variant. It’s a level 3 disease
whose Improve and Maintain DCs are 16 and 11. Stage 1 eats a healing
surge. Stage 2 adds a -2 penalty to AC, Fortitude, and Reflex. Stage 3 keeps
the penalty, eats all of your healing surges and prevents you from recovering
hit points.</p>

<p>This is one of those cases where the first stage is an annoyance, but you really
<em>don’t</em> want to let the disease progress to stage 3 (also known as “sepsis”).</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers-monster-vault">The Numbers (Monster Vault)</h2>

<p>We have three otyughs here, extending their viability as threats into the early
paragon tier. In the Monster Vault rules, disease transmission isn’t
automatic. You need to make a save after a fight in which you were exposed, and
only contract the disease if you fail.</p>

<h3 id="otyugh">Otyugh</h3>

<p>This one is an update of the MM Otyugh. Still a level 7 soldier with 82 HP, it
fights in much the same way. I’ll note the differences.</p>

<p>The damage from all of its attacks has been updated. The <strong>tentacles</strong> have a
fixed escape DC of 16, and the <strong>diseased bite</strong> deals extra damage against
grappled targets. Spying Eye is gone as a separate trait, though the creature’s
Stealth bonus of +13 means it does still get a boost here.</p>

<p>The bite’s disease is named Lesser Otyugh Filth Fever and has the exact same
stats despite being level 7. I guess the level 3 in the MM was a typo. Its text
does clarify that when you reach Stage 3, you can no longer make Endurance tests
to recover naturally.</p>

<h3 id="charnel-otyugh">Charnel Otyugh</h3>

<p>A specimen that likely spent too long hanging out in cemeteries or
battlefields. Or maybe the pet of some lich or vampire. Still a Large Natural
Beast, this one is a Level 10 Elite Soldier with 212 HP and a host of necrotic
powers.</p>

<p>The <strong>Stench</strong> is still here, with identical effects. Its basic tentacle attack
is the <strong>Charnel Lash</strong>, which works like the standard otyugh tentacle attack
with an escape DC of 18 and ongoing necrotic damage on top of the other effects
(save ends).</p>

<p>The charnel otyugh can use <strong>Life Leech</strong> against a grabbed target, a
minor-action attack against Fortitude that deals 10 necrotic damage and heals
the monster for 5 HP on a hit.</p>

<p>Its <strong>Rotting Bite</strong> also has an ongoing necrotic damage rider, and transmits
Greater Otyugh Filth Fever, a level 11 version of the disease with an Improve DC
of 19 and a Maintain DC of 13. Its effects are the same otherwise.</p>

<p>The monster can also flail its tentacles around in a <strong>Charnel Frenzy</strong> (Close
Burst 3; recharge 5-6) dealing a bit less damage than the basic attack but still
inflicting ongoing necrotic damage.</p>

<h3 id="neo-otyugh">Neo-Otyugh</h3>

<p>An otyugh mutated by the Far Realm, either from being exposed to a rift or from
eating aberrant creatures. Unlike its lesser relatives it’s a Huge Aberrant
Magical Beast, meaning its sapient! Its Int is 7, making it as smart as a hill
giant.</p>

<p>Neo-Otyughs are Level 11 Elite Controllers with 232 HP. Their land and swim
speeds go up to 7 from the usual 5. Their <strong>Stench</strong> is an aura 2 with the same
effects, and they also have <strong>Threatening Reach</strong>.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Tentacles</strong> are Reach 4, and aside from the usual damage a hit pulls 3
squares and grabs (DC 19). The usual bite has been upgraded to a <strong>Massive Maw
of Decay</strong> (close blast 2)! It does physical damage plus ongoing necrotic
damage, and exposes anyone hit to Greater Otyugh Filth Fever. It also does
extra damage against grabbed targets.</p>

<p>As if this wasn’t enough, Neo-Otyughs have psychic powers. <strong>Disgusting Lure</strong>
(Ranged 20 vs. Will) is a minor-action attack that does a bit of psychic damage
and a larger amount if the target doesn’t end their next turn adjacent to the
Otyugh.</p>

<p>The neo-otyugh can also used a grabbed victim as a <strong>Body Shield</strong> when hit by
an attack. This isn’t automatic, and requires an attack against the grabbed
victim’s Fortitude. On a success, the attack hits the victim instead of the
monster.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two in the MM, exemplifying the two most common otyugh fight scenarios.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: 1 otyugh and an assortment of troglodytes. The trogs use the otyugh
as a garbage disposal and will try to push meddlesome adventurers towards it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 7: 2 otyughs and 2 carrion crawlers. Carrion crawlers are opportunists
and will often hang around otyughs to steal their kills.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As I said back in the introduction, to me Otyughs are an iconic part of D&amp;D. If
I see an otyugh in a story of any type, I know it’s not just a fantasy story,
but specifically a D&amp;D one. So while I don’t exactly find them cool, I like them
in that capacity.</p>
