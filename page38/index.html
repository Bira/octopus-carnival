        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Beholders appear in every 4e Monster Manual and also in the Monster
Vault. They’re apparently too iconic to leave out! In this entry, we get spooky.</p>

<p>There’s no new “general” lore in this entry. Everything it introduces would be
packaged into the Monster Vault as well and we already looked at that lore here.</p>

<h2 id="beholder-spawn">Beholder Spawn</h2>

<p>D&amp;D 5th Edition would introduce that cool bit where beholders reproduce
asexually through nightmares. The MM3 just says that the means of beholder
reproduction are best left unknown. In either case, the result of that process
could be represented by this Beholder Spawn stat block.</p>

<p>These are beholders at the start of their life-cycle, very young and
comparatively weak but already quite smart and evil. You might find them
alongside their parents. Or perhaps they’re banding together for survival,
hoping to last long enough to be the first to reach full size and devour the
rest of their siblings.</p>

<p>In either case they’d be very aware of their fragility and would try to stay
mobile, spread out, and away from the reach of the PCs.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Beholder spawn are Medium Aberrant Magical Beasts, and Level 15 Minion
Artillery. They have a flight speed of 6, darkvision, and all-around vision
(which means they can’t be flanked).</p>

<p>Like all beholders, they <strong>bite</strong> in melee and fire <strong>eye rays</strong> with a maximum
range of 10. Their rays are a lot simpler than that of a “full” beholder, and do
elemental damage of the same type as one of the types used by their parent.</p>

<p>If a spawn is hit or missed by a close or area attack, they can use <strong>Desperate
Flight</strong> as an interrupt to shift 2 squares. This means they can try to get out
of the area of effect before they suffer damage.</p>

<h2 id="beholder-eye-of-shadow">Beholder Eye of Shadow</h2>

<p>In past articles we already established that beholders mutate when they cross
over from the Far Realm, taking characteristics that match their new
environment. Eyes of Shadow are beholders that hung out in the Shadowfell too
long, acquiring powers compatible with that bleak place.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-1">The Numbers</h3>

<p>We’re back in familiar territory here: this beholder is Large and a Level 12
Elite Lurker with 194 HP. It has the same speed and senses as the spawn above,
deals extra damage when it has combat advantage, and heals 20 HP at the end of a
turn if it has remained invisible since the start of that turn.</p>

<p>It capitalizes on those passive traits through a couple of auxiliary abilities:
its <strong>Central Eye</strong> (minor action 1/round) projects a fear attack that targets
Will and makes the target grant combat advantage; and it can <strong>Vanish Into
Shadow</strong> (recharge 5+) as a move action, teleporting up to 20 squares and
becoming invisible until it attacks or until the end of its next turn.</p>

<p>As for its actual attacks, there’s the usual <strong>bite</strong> and a set of 3 <strong>eye
rays</strong>. These are ranged attacks but don’t provoke opportunity attacks. The
beholder can fire two of them in the same action but must aim each at a
different target. They are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a <strong>Blinding Ray</strong> (vs. Reflex) that deals radiant damage and blinds for a
turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a <strong>Thundering Ray</strong> (vs. Fortitude) which deals heavy thunder damage and
deafens for a turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a <strong>Shadowbond Ray</strong> (vs. Will) that deals necrotic damage and immobilizes
(save ends). While this condition lasts, the beholder and any shadow creatures
in play have concealment while within 5 squares of the target.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This beholder wants to attack from ambush and use its central eye and blinding
ray to make the PCs grant it combat advantage from a distance. Then it’s going
to hit them with thundering rays and bites while enjoying the extra
damage. Shadowbond is for melee defenders, and Vanish Into Shadow is a good
escape hatch. The teleport range on that is so large it could allow the beholder
to escape combat entirely, though an overconfident or angry individual might
still return to the fight as soon as it finishes healing those 20 HP.</p>

<p>Its ability to target any defense makes it quite versatile, even if it only has
three rays.</p>

<h2 id="ghost-beholder">Ghost Beholder</h2>

<p>While the Eye of Shadow is merely goth, this one is actually undead. Beholders
are stubborn and hateful creatures at the best of times, so it’s natural that
some of them will linger on as ghosts after they die or are killed. This usually
suits them just fine, but it also makes the more cautious since they know they
won’t get a third chance at existence.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-2">The Numbers</h3>

<p>Ghost beholders are Large Level 18 Elite Controllers with 254 HP. It combines
common beholder traits (as seen on the two previous monsters) with undead
ones. It’s immune to disease and poison, and Vulnerable 10 to radiant damage. As
a ghost, it’s insubstantial and has phasing.</p>

<p>Its <strong>bite</strong> is a ghostly attack that targets Reflex and does necrotic
damage. Its <strong>Central Eye</strong> has a minor-action poltergeist effect that targets
Will, slides the target 5 squares, and gives if 5 vulnerability to necrotic and
psychic damage for a turn. All of its eye rays deal one of these damage types.</p>

<p>The ghost beholder has three <strong>eye rays</strong> to choose from. It can only fire one
on its own turn, but it also has the <strong>Eyes of the Beholder</strong> trait that gives
it a free random ray attack against enemies that start their turn within 5
squares of it.</p>

<p>The rays are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Chill of the Grave</strong> (vs. Fortitude) does cold and necrotic damage, and
slows (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ghostly Possession</strong> (vs. Will) inflicts 15 ongoing psychic damage (save
ends)e. The first failed save also dazes the target; the second one completes
the possession. Possessed targets are dominated, and the beholder disappears
from play until the effect ends. This happens on a sucessful save, or the
beholder can end it voluntarily.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Killing Thought</strong> (vs. Will) does psychic damage and forces the target to
make a melee basic attack against themselves! Targets who are not holding a
weapon will drop what they’re holding, draw a weapon, and make that attack
anyway, all as part of the same free action. Creepy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Ghost beholders are fond of phasing into the floor or walls to protect
themselves from attack, emerging from unexpected angles to shoot against the
characters. Fighting them without access to force and/or radiant damage is an
exercise in suffering.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>More Beholders! Even though the Eye of Shadow follows the same naming convention
as the Eyes of Flame and Frost, I think it has a better stat block. It does a
variety of unexpected damage types and can target any defense!</p>

<p>The Ghost Beholder also has interesting abilities, but its defenses make it a
nightmare to fight for an unprepared party. Even well-prepared undead hunters
might boggle a bit when they find one of those instead of more standard monster
like a vampire or banshee.</p>

<p>As for the spawn, I’d probably reskin them into something else. The idea of
mobile flying artillery minions is sound, but the thought of fighting beholder
“children” is a bit disturbing and I’m partial to the idea that beholders spawn
as fully-grown nightmares given form.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Behemoths were introduced in the first Monster Manual. As you can see
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/13/behemoth.html">there</a>, they’re basically fantasy dinosaurs. Most of them resemble the
dinosaurs we learned about as kids, but the “official” association is tenuous
enough that behemoths don’t have to change to conform to newer scientific
developments.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The book gives us a couple of poetic paragraphs about how behemoth steps thunder
through the landscape and so on. They’re nice.</p>

<p>The new information here is that behemoths are always in demand for use as war
beasts, so specimens young enough to train are a hot commodity. Capturing one is
not easy though, because mommy behemoths fight their hardest when protecting
their nests and their young. Some of them also live in really hard to reach
places.</p>

<p>Even “tame” behemoths aren’t 100% safe. There’s always a chance they’ll flip out
and turn on their handlers, and then escape to the wild after killing them. This
<em>could</em> happen in the middle of a battle, in which case the behemoth will attack
enemy and former ally alike until it can run off.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>We get three new behemoth species here. They’re Natural Beasts as usual, and
since we have a focus on behemoths that can be used as weapons they all have the
Mount keyword in addition to the usual Reptile keyword. Their other traits vary
per stat block, and their levels range from mid- to late- Heroic.</p>

<h3 id="bone-crown-behemoths">Bone Crown Behemoths</h3>

<p>This is an old-school triceratops. I understand the science on those has moved
on by now, but this is one of the advantages of behemoths over realistic
dinosaurs. Their size is Large.</p>

<p>Bone crowns are herbivorous but extremely aggressive and ill-tempered. They’re a
favorite of hobgoblins and troglodytes, who train them for use as unstoppable,
tank-like cavalry. The “poetic” imagery in the text describes these things
charging through infantry formations and coming out the other side adorned in
soldier guts hanging from their crowns as if they were pennants. As you might
have guessed, they have a relatively high chance to flip out and turn on their
riders in the heat of battle.</p>

<p>Bone crowns are Level 6 Soldiers with 71 HP and Speed 7. Their basic (and only)
attack action is a <strong>Head Butt</strong> that damages and marks for a turn. When used in
a charge it also pushes 1 square, and when used in an opportunity attack it
knocks prone.</p>

<p>They also have a couple of triggered actions: <strong>Threatening Bash</strong> allows them
to attack a marked enemy that shifts as an interrupt. <strong>Insult to Injury</strong> is
their mount power, and adds their “push 1 square” effect to their rider’s
charge attacks.</p>

<p>Use pseudo-cavalry tactics for these: charge in from a distance, crash into the
PCs, and then stay around to step on them and pin them down while your
skirmishers and atrillery have fun. It’s better if the charge comes in from a
flank and hits the squishies, but since the PCs aren’t an army that’s difficult
to arrange.</p>

<h3 id="skinwing-behemoth">Skinwing Behemoth</h3>

<p>One of those giant pterodactyls. They nest in craggy mountains, and thieves
often try to steal their eggs to sell to kingdoms looking to start or maintain
an air force. A lot of these thieves get killed by enraged skinwing parents.</p>

<p>These Large behemoths are Level 7 Skirmishers with 79 HP. Their ground speed is
a pitiful 2 (clumsy), but they fly at speed 8 (hover). That clumsiness means a
downed skinwing will do everything in its power to take flight again as soon as
possible… even abandon its rider.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong> with no special effects, but they have the
famous <strong>Flyby Attack</strong> power that allows them to fly their speed, make an
attack at any point, and not provoke opportunity attacks from their target. The
<strong>Strafe</strong> trait allows the rider to make a basic attack in place of their
mount’s bite during this maneuver.</p>

<p>The skinwing can also enhance a flyby attack with its <strong>Grasping Talons</strong>
(recharge 5+), which allow it to grab the target if the main attack hits. They
can then <strong>Drag Off</strong> the victim, carrying it with them while the grab
lasts.</p>

<p>Skinwings fight by doing constant flyby attacks, and carrying victims off to be
dropped from a great height when they can. Skinwing <em>cavalry</em> will coordinate
with ground forces to do the same thing in a maximally inconvenient way. PCs
would do well to knock them off the air as soon as possible and prevent them
from taking off again.</p>

<h3 id="spirehorn-behemoth">Spirehorn Behemoth</h3>

<p>I don’t think this Huge creature has an analog in the real world. At size Huge,
they’re so big they can mount platforms transporting up to a dozen people, and
they have big horns. They are the perfect vanity ride for your typical barbarian
chieftain or hobgoblin general, so there is high demand for eggs and even for
healthy adults. Lots of people die trying to get those.</p>

<p>Their actual battlefield use depends on the personality of their owners. Some
are used like thrones and sit in a palace somewhere. Others are mobile
fortified command centers that hang at the back of a fighting army. And others
are siege engines at the front lines, transporting troops instead of a single
big ego or command staff.</p>

<p>Spirehorns are Level 9 Elite Brutes with 234 HP. They confer the <strong>Beastmaster</strong>
trait to their rider, giving them a +1 to AC and Reflex. I guess only the person
actually directing the spirehorn gets the bonus. Their speed is 6.</p>

<p>A spirehorn’s basic attack is a <strong>gore</strong> with no special effects, and it can
make <strong>Double Attacks</strong>. Once per encounter it can build up some speed and
<strong>Trample</strong>, moving twice its speed. It can enter enemy spaces during this move
and makes a free attack on each enemy whose space it enters.</p>

<p>You’re likely to see these used in battle as living siege towers, or as carriers
for enemy leaders. In either case they’re going to be priority targets.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Dinosaurs are awesome even when they’re called Behemoths, and with the ones in
this entry plus the others we’ve seen before you have enough assemble a full
force organization table for a fantasy army that uses most of them in different
roles.</p>

<p>I think we even have enough “war beasts” at this point to make <em>themed</em>
armies. Here’s an example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Dragonborn use behemoths!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hobgoblins use mammalian megafauna, dire wolves, and giant bats!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elves use fey panthers and griffons!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dwarves ride dire boars!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kobolds use giant bugs!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Humans use horses and hippogriffs!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And everyone uses drakes because most of them are so common and easily tamed.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/05/19/cp-red-review.html">A Short Review: Cyberpunk RED</a>
        </h1>

            <figure class="center">

</figure>

<p>I remember buying the Cyberpunk 2020 core book around the mid-nineties. By then
it was already in its second edition. The first one was titled Cyberpunk 2013,
and it was released in 1988, making it the first actual cyberpunk RPG (Shadowrun
would arrive in 1989).</p>

<p>This system and its subsequent iterations remained mostly at the edges of my
awareness for a long time, since I was more of a Shadowrun fan. But recently I
started playing the Cyberpunk 2077 video game and I liked it enough that I
decided to also check out the latest edition of the tabletop game, Cyberpunk
RED.</p>

<p>The first thing I notice is that this is a <em>big</em> book. Nearly 500 pages in
length, I’m sure it would be quite hefty if it was a physical copy. The first
half of it is player-facing information starting with a setting overview,
character creation, basic rules, combat and finally netrunning. The second half
is a more detailed description of the setting, and then GM advice including a
series of short adventures.</p>

<p>When it comes to layout and presentation, R. Talsorian definitely learned from
its past mistakes with the ill-fated Cyberpunk V.3. Cyberpunk RED’s layout is
pretty clean, and its sans-serif font quite readable (to me at least). Page
margins have tastefully minimalistic decoration (done in red, of course) and the
illustrations are gorgeous and very detailed. Very little of the text is
obviously copied from CP 2020, surely another lesson learned from CP V3.</p>

<p>The mechanics are pretty much a new iteration of the Interlock system used by
CP2020. The basic numbers are tweaked a bit, but it should be pretty familiar to
anyone who played the earlier edition and pretty easy for newcomers to
learn. There are some useful artifacts from FUZION that managed to sneak into
the game, like the concept of “everyday skills” every character should know.</p>

<p>The combat rules are a bit simpler all around and should be fairly fun, but I
dislike that they do the “Martial Arts Thing” that was so common in a lot of
RPGs written in the 90s. You can be a pleb and learn Brawling, or you can learn
one of four elegant Martial Arts styles from the far and mysterious East! They
make your fists into registered lethal weapons and give you access to deadly
Secret Techniques! Bleh. I dislike the exoticism implied in this view.</p>

<p>Armor is really good compared to gun damage, and there is a very clear
“firefight meta” going on here. An unarmored character is going to go down
quickly, but it’s very easy to get concealable armor that will stop most bullets
at least 50% of the time. Practically every sample PC and opponent wears this
exact armor <em>and</em> carries the only handgun with a better than even chance of
getting through. The only ones who wear or carry anything lighter are those
enemies whose main distinction is having shitty gear, and those PCs for whom
combat is a tertiary concern.</p>

<p>The netrunning rules do a solid job of avoiding the pitfalls from the original
set. A hacking session is still a sort of mini-dungeon-crawl, but it’s a lot
more abstract and well-integrated into “meatspace” initiative. It also requires
the netrunner to be on-site, so that they can participate in the physical side
of the adventure with the rest of the group. My main criticism here is that
these rules remain very tightly coupled to their corresponding setting elements,
just like they were in CP2020. The new netrunning system comes accompanied by a
bunch of cataclysmic setting changes and a technical explanation that’s pretty
much just a word salad. Luckily this is extremely easy to eject.</p>

<p>The cyberware rules are essentially the same as always, though they carve a few
important and long overdue exceptions to the Humanity Loss rules. Still, I feel
they could have gone further.</p>

<p>As for the setting… I’ll be honest, I never knew there was so much backstory
and metaplot to it. I remember the setting section in CP 2020 as a sort of
“lightly flavored background soup” that was just there to explain why you had
cybered-up folks being all punky in this fictional city. CP RED decides to delve
way deep into it, with a huge historical section that serves as a stealth “2020
era” supplement before moving on to the 2045 narrative present of this
game.</p>

<p>While I think the narrative presents of RED and 2077 are both very interesting,
I have a lot of nits to pick with all that backstory and metaplot, and with the
ways it seems to remain static for a long time or loop over itself. Personally,
I’d probably move up its divergence point with the real world by a good 30+
years and condense a lot of the subsequent events up to 2077 into something more
dynamic and streamlined.</p>

<p>Proceeding to the GM advice, I finally find out where the copied text from
previous editions is this time. The first couple of pages in this section
reproduce a lot of advice I remember seeing from editions past. Some of it is
serious, some of it is a tongue-in-cheek parody, all of it feels very dated when
read in The Actual Year of 2022. Apparently the reader is supposed to easily
distinguish the real advice from the jokes, but in my experience that never
really works.</p>

<p>After we get past this bit of cringe, we get to advice on plotting
adventures. Though it talks in terms of “script-writing”, it does recognize
things will go off-script and that improvisation is essential. “Just roll with
it” is very basic advice but it’s still welcome.</p>

<p>The system for awarding XP at the end of each session recommends classifying
players according to their playstyles, and evaluating them based on how well
they stuck to that classification. The combat monster should get XP for fighting
well, the roleplayer for roleplaying well, and so on. I’d have been all over
this back when 2020 was still the distant future. These days, though, I don’t
want to have to tell Player A that they got less XP than Player B for failing to
live up to the way I think they should play. In my games, when someone does
something worthy of a XP bonus, <em>everyone</em> gets that bonus. We all lift
together!</p>

<p>Finally, just like in CP2020, there’s a section of “screamsheets”, two-page
spreads containing a handful of fictional news articles on the left and a
mini-adventure on the right. These are entertaining.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>It might seem like I’m complaining a lot, but I’d happily play Cyberpunk
RED. The system is simple and very playable, and most actual groups are likely
to care little about deep metaplot cuts. It’s a good game overall.</p>

<p>Speaking as a GM, I don’t think the CP RED system clears my personal “Treshold
of GURPS”. If I had ample time to prepare and plan, I’d probably adapt its
setting to that system. However I’d happily run the game as-is if I had to do it
on the spot. I’d just hand out the ready-made RED iconics as PCs, and pick one
of the short adventures at the back of the book.</p>

<p>In either case, if the setting’s timeline was important, I’d probably use the
hypotethical condensed version I mentioned earlier. And I’m definitely going to
ditch that advice that says a group of PCs can’t hope for anything more than
their own survival and maybe doing some small good beyond that. You don’t get to
say that and have a setting where Rache Bartmoss can take the whole NET and
quite a few megacorps down in one fell swoop, and where Johnny Silverhand’s
raids on Arasaka Tower are practically a regular event. If these clowns can have
that much of an impact, then so can any PC group whose players are interested in
this sort of game.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>I’m fairly sure Banderhobbs are a new monster. If they appeared before, it was
in a book I don’t own.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Banderhobbs stuck in my memory as a notable monster when I first read this book,
and now that I’m here again I can see why. They’re D&amp;D’s take on the Boogeyman,
the monsters parents use to scare their children. Be good, or a banderhobb will
come to you in your sleep and take you away.</p>

<p>This isn’t just a fairy tale, though. Banderhobbs really exist. On moonless
nights, they set forth from their home in the Shadowfell, cross into the world,
and look for victims. Once a banderhobb has chosen a victim, it will chase and
swallow them.</p>

<p>All banderhobbs live in the same sinister tower in the Shadowfell, under the
command of an ancient master the book doesn’t describe beyond saying he
exists. Banderhobbs who catch their victims return there to regurgitate them,
intact, in front of their master. No one knows what the inside of the tower is
like, or what happens to the abductees.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three Banderhobb stat blocks here. They’re all Shadow Magical Beasts with
darkvision and ground/swim speeds of 6. Their levels place them in the
mid-to-late paragon tier.</p>

<h3 id="banderhobb-warder">Banderhobb Warder</h3>

<p>This Large monster is a Level 16 Soldier with 160 HP. Warders are the ones that
most closely resemble a classic horror movie monster or boogeyman. They have an
uncanny ability to chase their chosen victims, appearing from under beds and
inside closets, always a step ahead.</p>

<p>They strike with a Reach 2 <strong>Lonfinger Claw</strong> or with a <strong>Longfinger Clutch</strong>
that’s a little weaker but can target two creatures. Both attacks mark on a hit,
and the mark lasts for a turn. They can also make a a Range 5 <strong>Lightning
Tongue</strong> attack that deals lightning damage and knocks prone on a hit.</p>

<p>Marked enemies are in for a bad time. When they end their move, the warder can
teleport up to 10 squares to appear next to them. If they try to make an attack
that doesn’t target the warder, the warder can <strong>Swallow</strong> them! This is an
attack against Fortitude, and the warder can shift 3 squares before making it. A
hit means the victim is removed from the map, as they’re now inside the warder.</p>

<p>While in the warder’s gullet, they take ongoing 10 damage. They can make melee
and close attacks against the warder, or take other non-attack actions. The
effect lasts until the warder hits 0 HP, or until it spits the victim out as a
free action.</p>

<p>There is no save or test that allows an early escape. The warder must die or
regurgitate for the victim to leave its gullet. I guess the warder could also
opt not to damage the victim if we want something like what happens in the lore
story.</p>

<h3 id="banderhobb-filch">Banderhobb Filch</h3>

<p>Instead of being a big frog thing that swallows people, the filch is a Small
lizard thing that puts people in a sack and drags them away. It’s a Level 17
Skirmisher with the Leader keyword and 164 HP.</p>

<p>Filches fight with their claws, using <strong>Quick Claw</strong> basic attacks that allow
them to shift on a hit and weaker <strong>Hook Strikes</strong> that grab the target. Once
per encounter they go on a <strong>Distracting Frenzy</strong>, attacking every enemy in a
Close Burst 1 and allowing an ally within 5 squares to make a free standard
action.</p>

<p>They can attack from further away by hocking <strong>Stinking Gobs</strong> (Ranged 5) at
their enemies, or by teleporting with <strong>Shadow Blink</strong> and making a strong claw
attack at either end of the movement.</p>

<p>I would guess being grabbed by a banderhobb filch means being stuffed into the
sack. It’s a normal grab, so you can still fight back and try to escape, but
there’s no limit to the number of greabbed creatures. The filch can use <strong>Drag
Away</strong> to move its speed and pull all grabbed creatures along with it.</p>

<h3 id="banderhobb-abductor">Banderhobb Abductor</h3>

<p>We’re back to the “big frog thing” form factor. Abductors are Level 18 Brutes
with 211 HP. They’re all about swallowing victims as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Bite</strong> and they can fling their <strong>Grasping Tongues</strong>
out to Range 5. A hit does damage and pulls the victim adjacent to the
banderhobb, grabbing it. It can use <strong>Swallow</strong> (recharge 5+) on a grabbed
victim, which works like the Warder power but as a standard action attack
instead of a reaction.</p>

<p>When the abductor is first bloodied, it <strong>Crosses into Shadow</strong>, disappearing
from play for a turn and re-appearing 10 squares away. A bloodied abductor can
use <strong>Gobble</strong>, which is a stronger bite that also grabs the target <em>and</em> allows
an immediate Swallow follow-up, recharging the ability as needed.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Bandehobbs are spooky and evocative. The book text really lays the purple prose
on thick for them, but I think that works rather well. They’re also a shadow
creature <em>without</em> a death theme. They’re neither goth nor undead, which is kind
of a rarity.</p>

<p>They pair well with evil fey that have a “nightmare” theme, and that Shadowfell
tower sounds like a good final dungeon for a Paragon Tier campaign.</p>

<p>I don’t remember seeing arcanians anywhere else before, though they do have that
“late-3e feeling” to them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Wizardry is a craft that demands great patience and care. While a warlock
“cheats” by making shady deals with dubious entities, a wizard earns every bit
of power they have. But some wizards have less than great patience and care, and
try to reach a bit too far beyond their current ability.</p>

<p>In the vast majority of cases that just results in an embarrassing fizzle, but
sometimes the magic goes out of control and causes a major accident. Most of
<em>those</em> end up turning the caster into a messy stain on the floor, but some are
worse.</p>

<p>In these rare cases, the wizard absorbs most of the runaway magic, which kills
them and animates the corpse. The resulting entity is known as an Arcanian. Its
sapient and highly intelligent, but utterly consumed by whatever strong emotion
the wizard felt as they died, further warped by the nature of the magic that
killed them.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Arcanians are Medium Natural Humanoids (Undead). Each is themed around an
element and an emotion, though ironically they have no particular resistance
against their own theme element. They have a ground speed of 6 and no special
senses. They also carry wizardly implements that give them abilities similar to
that of a PC wizard.</p>

<p>Their signature ability is <strong>Arcane Surge</strong>, an encounter power that triggers
when they hit an enemy with an implement power (anything but their basic melee
attack). It makes that power deal maximum damage.</p>

<h3 id="green-arcanian">Green Arcanian</h3>

<p>Green Arcanians are half-melted monstrosities. Acid seeps from their pores, and
their footsteps leave seared footprints. Their driven by envy and a hatred of
beauty, which they use acid magic to destroy.</p>

<p>Green Arcanians are Level 8 Artillery with 67 HP. All of their attacks deal acid
damage. Their basic melee attack is an <strong>Acid Touch</strong>, and their basic ranged
attack an <strong>Acid Bolt</strong> that also deals a bit of splash damage to enemies
adjacent to the target. Less often they can cast a <strong>Stream of Acid</strong> (recharge
5+) that does heavy damage and inflicts a -2 AC penalty and 5 ongoing acid
damage (save ends both).</p>

<p>Their implement power is <strong>Orb of Denial</strong>, an interrupt which triggers when an
enemy succeeds on a save and makes them fail the save instead. Thankfully this
is an encounter power.</p>

<h3 id="blue-arcanian">Blue Arcanian</h3>

<p>This shivering corpse despises warmth, and believes that people and things can
remain forever perfect if they’re frozen. As you might imagine, it goes around
attempting to preserve everything it likes.</p>

<p>Blue Arcanians are Level 10 Controllers with 105 HP. They move slightly slower
than normal at Speed 5, and all of their powers deal cold damage.</p>

<p>Their basic melee attack is a <strong>Frost Staff</strong> that also pushes 2 squares and
immobilizes for a turn. They fight at range with at-will <strong>Bolts of Frost</strong> that
turn the area surrounding the target into difficult terrain for a turn, and once
per encounter they can summon a <strong>Swirling Blizzard</strong> to deal damage over an
area (half on a miss).</p>

<p>Their implement power is <strong>Staff of Shielding</strong>, which once per encounter gives
them +4 to all defenses against an attack.</p>

<h3 id="red-arcanian">Red Arcanian</h3>

<p>These eternally burning undead are gripped in the throes of fiery passion or
red-hot wrath. They want to burn the world and take great pleasure in doing so.</p>

<p>Red Arcanians are considerably more powerful than the rest: Level 19 Artillery
with 131 HP. All of their attacks deal fire damage, and they carry wands.</p>

<p>Their melee basic attack is a <strong>Fiery Touch</strong>, and their ranged spells will be
familiar to PC wizards: <strong>Scorching Burst</strong> is an at-will area attack, and
<strong>Burning Hands</strong> is an encounter power that hits a close blast 5 that deals
heavy damage and pushes 3 squares.</p>

<p>Their implement encounter power is <strong>Wand of Accuracy</strong>, which gives them a +4
bonus to their next attack.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>Just because liches are the most iconic undead wizards, it doesn’t mean they’re
the only ones. Arcanians seem like a good monster to use when you want to make
an adventure themed around wizards who dug too deep.</p>

<p>You could have a whole ruined academy filled with a variety of them and with
other supporting undead or summoned extra-planar monsters. It’s easy enough to
change the ruling element of the stat blocks presented here, or to adjust their
level so you can have all three in the same dungeon. Maybe there’s a tome or
artifact in its vaults that the party must recover, or maybe it’s just a place
they need to pass through on their perilous journey.</p>

<p>Sprinkle in journal entries that hint at the disaster that destroyed the place,
and add a big lich with multiple elemental attacks as the “end boss”. And there
you have it, an instant Dark Souls level for your 4e table.</p>
