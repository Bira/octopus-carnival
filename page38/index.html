<p>As we saw in a <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/05/23/force-screens.html">recent post</a>, force screens in GURPS work in a manner that is
almost, but not entirely unlike that of energy shields in popular game
franchises like Borderlands, Mass Effect, or Warframe. If you’re familiar with
these games and read GURPS for the first time, the differences might trip you up
a bit.</p>

<p>Energy shields in these games usually work like a separate pool of HP. Attacks
that hit your character take directly from this pool, which lets nothing through
until it’s completely depleted. Once that happens the character must avoid
getting hit for a few seconds before their shields start to regenerate, which in
turn takes a few more seconds. Games that give players a lot of insight into
their numbers tend to also provide lots of options to tweak your shield recharge
delay and recharge rate. Still, recovering your shields is always easier than
recovering your “real” HP, which requires healing items or powers.</p>

<p>These games also feature multiple damage types of varying effectiveness against
each type of defense. An attack that’s good at damaging shields will usually be
worse at damaging HP (and/or armor, if that’s a thing in the game), and
vice-versa.</p>

<p>How would this look like in GURPS? Let’s make an attempt to adapt these
mechanics.</p>

<h2 id="campaign-option-energy-shields">Campaign Option: Energy Shields</h2>

<p>This is a campaign option for settings which use force screens, making them work
in a more “video-game-like” fashion (described above). It’s good for campaigns
meant to emulate the games I discuss at the beginning of this post. If you’re
instead trying to model something like Star Trek shields, use the default rules
from Ultra-Tech instead.</p>

<p>Under these rules, Force Screens still provide the listed DR for the equipment
in question, but this DR is considered fully Ablative and ignores all armor
divisors. If an attack lowers the screen’s DR to 0, any excess damage is
lost. Attacks with the Surge modifier cause double damage to force screens, and
they protect from radiation as if it was damage. This does mean that an attack
that does “rad sur” damage would do triple damage to a force screen.</p>

<p>Shields recover at the usual rate of 10% per second, but they only start
recovering after the user spends 2 seconds without being hit by further
attacks. If the user is hit while the shield is mid-recovery, it takes another 2
seconds before it can start again.</p>

<p><em>Shield Overflow</em>: GMs who don’t want to bother with the bookkeeping can
eliminate both the 2-second recharge delay and the “no overflow” property of
force screens. This means that damage in excess of the shield’s DR applies
to the user, but the screen begins recovering on the very next turn.</p>

<p>All force screen variants from Ultra-Tech p. 191-192 <em>except</em> Kinetic and Energy
can still apply to force screens using this rule<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Remember Tom Tomorrow and the Robber Baron? Let’s see how their many
confrontations would have happened under this rule. As before, Tom Tomorrow has
a DR 60 personal force screen and a DR 30/15* armored space suit, and the Baron
has an increasingly absurd modern arsenal.</p>

<p>During the First National Bank robbery, each shot from the Baron’s 9mm pistol
(damage 2d+2 pi) would reduce the DR of Tom’s Force Screen by 9 on average. It
would take 7 shots to disable the force screen entirely, but until that happens
Tom is completely safe from the Baron’s gunfire. Tom can’t just stand there and
laugh at the villain anymore, but he can still easily make the arrest.</p>

<p>During the Second National Bank robbery, each shot from the baron’s assault
rifle (damage 5d pi) would reduce the DR of Tom’s Force Screen by 18! It will
only take four of them before Tom’s shields are down, forcing him to be a lot
more careful this time around. He can still take a lucky burst and survive
unscathed, but likely has to hide behind some hard cover once or twice to let
his shields recover. He’s still quite a bit safer than a mundane cop would be,
though.</p>

<p>During the Third National Bank Robbery, the Baron’s antitank grenade (damage
4d(10) cr exp) would reduce the screen’s DR by 14, but Tom himself would be
completely unaffected by the explosion! The Baron would likely be so surprised
by this Tom would easily be able to handcuff him for the third and final
time.</p>

<p>If the Baron somehow got ahold of a death ray (6d burn rad sur), each
shot from that weapon would do <em>63</em> damage to Tom’s shields on average, meaning
a single shot would be enough to destroy them! Tom himself would still be
unaffected, but subsequent shots would threathen him directly until he had a
couple of seconds to let his screen recharge at least a little. Luckily for him
and for Paragon City, futuristic beam weapons are totally outside the Baron’s
idiom.</p>

<p>This post is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>You probably heard of beholders before. You know, floaty spheres with a toothy
mouth and an arbitrarily large number of eyes. They’re kind of a big deal. I
believe they’ve been in the game since at least the BECMI era, and were one of
the handful of creatures declared off-limits by Wizards of the Coast when they
opened the door for third-party content through the OGL.</p>

<p>As classic boss monsters who nevertheless don’t quite get the same level of hype
as dragons, it’s quite possible more D&amp;D players have faced beholders than have
faced the monster mentioned in the game’s own title.</p>

<p>Both the Monster Manual and the Monster Vault contain stats for beholders. We’ll
look at both in parallel.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The lore bits in the monster manual say barely more than the first two sentences
in this article. Beholders are among the most feared monsters of all, and are
so egotistical they normally can’t get along even with others of their
kind. They like to rule over “lesser” creatures, a category which includes
pretty much anyone other than themselves.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault elaborates on the above. It says beholders come from the Far
Realm, but that unlike lots of other aberrant creatures that either cross over
into our world by accident or to cause destruction, they come here as
conquerors. There are many beholder varieties, and this diversity is further
increased by the fact that some of then are changed by the passage from the Far
Realm into the world.</p>

<p>All beholders are anti-social megalomaniacs, though, believing themselves the
rightful rulers of everything they see (and yes, the book does make the pun that
they see a lot with all those eyes). Beholders don’t really have allies - they
have minions they lord over or masters they constantly plot to overthrow,
Starscream-like.</p>

<p>Other interesting beholder facts gathered by osmosis from other editions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Their flight is natural, not magic (their organisms contain pockets of
lighter-than-air gas).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beholders reproduce asexually, by nightmare. By this I mean that when a
beholder has a particularly bad nightmare, that nightmare will manifest
physically and take the form of a new beholder. No wonder they’re so
antisocial. Each beholder is some other beholder’s literal worst nightmare.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You decide which of these are true in your game, of course.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Beholders are aberrant magical beasts. All are highly intelligent and of Evil
alignment. They move via flight, and can hover. With all those eyes, they’re
trained in Perception, have darkvision, and all-around vision, which means they
can’t be flanked.</p>

<p>Their signature ability are the infamous eye rays, both from the little eyes on
stalks and from the large central one. Each variety has a different set. They’re
all ranged attacks, but they don’t provoke opportunity attacks from PCs. Let’s
look at them sorted by level:</p>

<h3 id="beholder-gauth">Beholder Gauth</h3>

<p>This is a fun-sized version from the Monster Vault. The only Medium beholder,
it’s Level 5 Elite Artillery with 102 HP. As a standard action it can bite or
fire two of its eye rays at different targets, chosen from its list of four
possible options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The fire ray targets Reflex and does fire damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The exhaustion ray targets Fortitude, does somewhat less necrotic damage and
  weakens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sleep ray targets Fort, does no damage and slows, with the condition
  worsening to unconsciousness on the first failed save.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The telekinesis ray targets Fort, does no damage and slides a target 4
  squares.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As a minor action, it fires a beam from its central eye that targets Will, does
no damage and immobilizes.</p>

<p>The gauth’s non-damaging beams means it works better when together with other
monsters that can take advantage of them. I guess that as the weakest beholder,
it’s either going to rely more on its servants, or it’s going to be made a
servant of a more powerful villain.</p>

<h3 id="beholder">Beholder</h3>

<p>The classic model, from the Monster Vault. It’s a Large aberrant magical beast,
and a Level 9 Solo Artillery menace with 392 HP. It flies a bit slower than the
gauth (Speed 4 instead of Speed 6), which fits since it’s more of a battleship
than an agile corvette.</p>

<p>For its standard actions, we have the standard bite, which does decent damage
but it’s not likely to see use if the beholder has its way. The main attraction
are its <em>ten different eye beams</em>. It gets to fire any two of its choice against
different targets per standard action.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Charm: Targets Will, no damage, dominates for a turn.</li>
  <li>Wounding: Targets Fortitude, straight necrotic damage.</li>
  <li>Sleep: Targets Will. No damage, immobilizes, and that turns into
unconciousness after the first failed save.</li>
  <li>Telekinesis Targets Fort, slides 4 squares.</li>
  <li>Slowing: Targets Reflex, does necrotic damage and slows.</li>
  <li>Brilliant: Targets Will, does radiant damage and blinds.</li>
  <li>Terror: Targets Will, does psychic damage and pushes the target its
speed.</li>
  <li>Petrifying: Targets Fort, does no damage but petrifies right away! This is a
(save ends) effect, so it’s not quite fight-ending but it’s still
scary. After you save from the petrification, you’re still immobilized until
you pass another save.</li>
  <li>Death: Targets Fortitude. More necrotic damage than the wounding ray. If it
bloodies the target (or hits an already bloodied target) it sets off a chain
reaction: the target becomes dazed; on the first failed save, that turns into
dazed and weakened; on the second, the target <em>dies</em>.</li>
  <li>Disintegration: Targets Fortitude, does untyped damage and 10 ongoing
damage.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the beholder is bloodied, it gains an Eye Ray Frenzy that recharges on a 6
and allows it to make 3 beam attacks instead of 2.</p>

<p>Those are just the standard actions. As a minor action, the beholder can use its
traditional anti-magic central eye, a close blast 5 attack that targets Will and
does no damage, but prevents affected targets from using encounter and daily
powers for a turn. Yes, it <em>can</em> prevent purely martial characters from using
their special tricks, but that’s easily intepreted as a sort of enervating
effect instead of or in addition to the usual magic-dampening.</p>

<p>Finally, any enemy that starts its turn within 5 squares of the beholder gets
tagged by a random eye ray a the start of the enemy’s own turn. That’s why
they’re numbered! Roll 1d10 and watch your players pray they only get the
vanilla wounding beam.</p>

<h3 id="beholder-eye-of-flame">Beholder Eye of Flame</h3>

<p>This one exists only on the Monster Manual. It’s Level 13 Elite Artillery, with
204 HP. It has the same “hit everyone nearby with a random eye ray” power as the
classic Beholder, but here it’s written up as an aura. It flies at speed 6, and
is all about fire.</p>

<p>Being a MM1 monster, it shows some of the early rough design issues: its bite is
ridiculously weak instead of doing level-appropriate damage like the two
previous beholders. It has three different eye beams, and can use two of them
against different creatures per standard action. At least one of those must be
the fire ray, but the other can be chosen freely.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fire: Fire damage vs. Reflex.</li>
  <li>Telekinesis: As above.</li>
  <li>Fear: Targets Will, and works similarly to the fear ray from the classic
beholder, but bestows an additional -2 penalty to attacks (save ends).</li>
</ol>

<p>It minor-action Central Eye power <em>automatically</em> gives a target Vulnerable 10
to fire, and makes them take 5 ongoing fire damage if they take fire damage from
any source. This is a (save ends) condition, so the eye of flame will try to
saddle every member of the party with it eventually. That more than makes up for
its lack of eye ray variety.</p>

<p>When bloodied, and once again when it dies, the eye of flame lets loose a fiery
burst that targets Reflex and deals fire damage to everyone on a Close
burst 2. I guess its buoyant gasses are more flamable than usual.</p>

<h3 id="beholder-eye-tyrant">Beholder Eye Tyrant</h3>

<p>The strongest of the lot, and present in both the Monster Manual and Monster
Vault. The two versions are mostly identical aside from updated math.</p>

<p>The Eye Tyrant is a Level 19 Solo Artillery weapons platform, essentially a
vastly up-gunned classic beholder. The bite on the MM version is evey more
ridiculously weak than that of the Eye of Flame, but the MV version strengthens
it to what’s expected for a level 19 monster (MM: 2d6+1; MV: 4d8+7).</p>

<p>The Eye Tyrant’s ten eye rays are slightly different:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Searing: Targets Reflex, straight radiant damage.</li>
  <li>Withering: Targets Fortitude, necrotic damage and ongoing 10 necrotic damage.</li>
  <li>Sleep: Targets Will, no damage but causes instant unconsciousness (save
ends).</li>
  <li>Telekinesis: identical to the classic beholder’s.</li>
  <li>Hold: Targets Reflex, no damage but restrains the target (save
ends). Restrained is Immobilized’s big brother: the former only roots you to
the spot, the latter prevents all action.</li>
  <li>Confusion: Targets Will, does no damage but forces the target to charge the
nearest ally it can charge.</li>
  <li>Terror: The MM version is similar to the classic beholder’s. The MV version
does psychic damage and makes the target move its speed away from the eye
tyrant. This is different from a push because the target chooses where they
end up. And it that destination is still within 4 squares of the beholder,
the target takes psychic damage again!</li>
  <li>Petrifying: Targets fortitude and induces gradual petrification: slowed,
worsening to immobilized and petrified with failed saves. Petrification this
time is <em>permanent</em>.</li>
  <li>Death: Like the classic beholder’s but with lots more necrotic damage.</li>
  <li>Disintegration: Like the classic beholder’s, but ongoing damage is <em>2d20</em>
instead of a flat 10.</li>
</ol>

<p>The eye tyrant’s eye ray frenzy allows it to fire four beams instead of the
usual 2 on a recharge 6 timer.</p>

<p>Its minor-action Central Eye blast dazes on the MM version, and disables
encounter and daily powers on the MV version. It still has random eye rays.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I’ve never used beholders in a game before, but I still have fond memories of
them from the D&amp;D cartoon and arcade games. Their 4e stat blocks give me pretty
much the same feel as the ones from previous editions, since those also had the
entire explanation for what each eye ray did as an itemized list.</p>

<p>Fourth Edition shies away from instant save-or-die effects, so beholders end up
with a lot fewer of those. Still, the classic beholder has one in the new
“gradual doom” flavor, and the Eye Tyrant has two. The level 9 beholder is
nastier than it seems too, because it’s a suitable boss battle for a party of
level 6 adventurers who won’t have easy access to resurrection yet.</p>

<p>Energy shields are a popular science fiction trope, appearing in enough stories
to feature in GURPS Ultra-Tech as Force Screens and Force Shields. However, I
didn’t have a very clear idea of how they worked until recently.</p>

<p>The text describing them is a bit… fuzzy, probably because this was one of the
first supplements written for GURPS Fourth Edition. The “real” explanation makes
sense, but it does require quite a bit more deduction, research and/or knowing
the rules by heart than latter additions to the system. To make it easier on
you, here’s the complete picture of how GURPS Force Screens work, to the best of
my knowledge:</p>

<p>GURPS Force Screens come in “Barrier” and “Conformal” varieties, where the first
represents the sort of shields used by starships or cities, and the second
represents the kind worn by individuals and very common in video games. They
both work the same way rules-wise.</p>

<p>Force Screens provide DR to the person or thing they protect (the “user”). They
protect all of the user’s hit locations, even the eyes. Anything that hits the
user must contend with the force screen’s DR first, separate from any other DR
from armor. Every 10 points of rolled damage from the attack reduces force
screen DR by 1, whether it penetrates or not. Force Screens regenerate 10% of
their lost DR every second.</p>

<p>In short, they work exactly like DR (Force Field +20%, Semi-Ablative -10%), with
Regeneration (Very Fast) applied to their DR instead of the user’s HP.</p>

<p>Armor-piercing attacks apply their armor divisor both against the screen’s DR
<em>and</em> against the number of damage points needed to ablate it. This was the hard
bit to figure out! People have been asking questions about this for years
according to <a href="https://gurps.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Divisor">this source</a>.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Tom Tomorrow is a hero transported straight from the pages of pulp space opera
to modern-day Paragon City. He fights crime with the help of his raygun, armored
space suit (DR 30/15*), and personal force screen projector (DR 60).</p>

<p>The Robber Baron is at it again, robbing the First National Bank. Tom Tomorrow
arrives ot save the day, and the Baron shoots him with his pistol. The gun does
2d+2 pi damage, and its average damage roll of 9 is certainly not enough to get
past Tom’s force screen. In fact, it would take 2 shots to reduce the screen’s
DR by 1, and it would recover soon afterwards. The Baron has no means of harming
Tom, making this an easy arrest.</p>

<p>Some time later, the Baron escapes jail and tries to rob the Second National
Bank. Tom intervenes again, and this time the baron fires at him with an assault
rifle! The weapon does 5d pi damage and has a RoF of 12. Its average damage roll
of 18 means a single shot can’t penetrate the force screen, but it does reduce
its DR by 1. Assuming all shots hit, a second of sustained fire would lower the
screen’s DR by 21. 6 of those points would return at the start of each turn, and
it would take about three seconds before any bullets started getting through. Of
course, it’s rare for all shots in a 12-round burst to hit and Tom isn’t just
going to stand there, so the screen still makes him much safer than a mundane
police officer would be. He manages to arrest the Baron once again.</p>

<p>Yet more time later the Baron escapes <em>again</em> and tries to rob the Third
National Bank. This time, when Tom arrives to stop him, the baron shoots him
with an antitank grenade from his rifle’s brand new underbarrel launcher. The
grenade does 4d(10) cr ex damage, with an average roll of 14. The screen
protects against this with DR 6, and loses 14 points of DR from the attack. 8
damage get through to Tom’s armored space suit. It would normally protect
against crushing damage with DR 15, but the armor divisor still applies, so it
only protects against this blast with DR 1. Tom takes 7 points of damage and is
visibly staggered and bloodied. Oh no! Can he defeat the Robber Baron this time?</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Force Screens are good protection against single attacks, and give you something
of a safety buffer against sustained fire from multiple sources. Anything that’s
good at getting through physical armor will get through them just as well,
though, and deplete them faster.</p>

<p>Pretty much every weapon available at the same TL as force screens will have an
armor divisor of at least 3, and more often 5 or 10, so their DR is going to
ablate at a faster rate than you might think from looking at them in
isolation. Against lower-tech weapons, though, even the belt-mounter personal
force screen is enough to make its user as hard to take down as a lightly
armored vehicle.</p>

<p>In a future article I’m going to look at how to tweak GURPS force screens to
make them work a bit more like video-game shields.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Let’s get this out of the way right now: behemoths are dinosaurs. Dinosaurs have
been a feature of D&amp;D at least since the X1 module for BECMI, but as far as I
know the new nomenclature is new in Fourth Edition.</p>

<p>While I don’t know for sure why the authors decided on the name change, I can
speculate. On Earth we call dinosaurs by Latin/Greek scientific names because we
only known them through scientific studies - the creatures themselves became
extinct millions of years ago.</p>

<p>The world of D&amp;D, however, is not Earth! They never spoke any Latin or Greek
there. And in the setting implied by the Monster Manual, <em>dinosaurs never went
extinct</em>. So naturally people who interact with them would come up with
common-usage names for them. Another benefit of the alternate nomenclature might
be that it frees authors to diverge from currently accepted science a bit. I’ve
seen people get strict about it when the “dinosaur” terminology starts getting
thrown arround, even in D&amp;D monster books.</p>

<p>The two behemoths presented in the first Monster Manual are described as
omnivirous reptiles that live in herds and use their size and ferocity to drive
out threats and rivals. Both are Large Natural Beasts, with the “reptile”
keyword and Int 2. “Reptile” doesn’t come with any attached mechanics (like
“aquatic” does), but I imagine some other monsters might have powers that
interact with it. They’re only on the Monster Manual.</p>

<h2 id="macetail-behemoth">Macetail Behemoth</h2>

<p>This one resembles a real-world ankylosaurus. D&amp;D macetails are ill-tempered and
territorial on the wild, but if raised from hatchlings they can be domesticated
for use as pack animals. They’re Level 7 Soldiers with 82 HP, and fight with
their tails. Their basic attack is a Tail Bludgeon that marks, and they can
sweep their tails on a Close burst 1 that targets Reflex, and knocks Medium or
smaller targets prone on a hit (in addition to doing damage). The sweep
recharges on 4-6.</p>

<p>The specification that the targets must be Medium or smaller is a bit
unusual. After all, that covers every possible PC, so it’s theoretically
unnecessary. I imagine it’s there in case the PCs have their own domesticated
behemoths or other giant allies on their side.</p>

<h2 id="bloodspike-behemoth">Bloodspike Behemoth</h2>

<p>AKA stegosaurus. Also fiercely territorial, with an even fouler mood than the
macetail. Even domesticated bloodspikes (used to pull heavy loads or siege
engines) are difficult to train and control.</p>

<p>They’re level 9 Brutes with 118 HP, and also fight with their tails. The basic
Spiked Tail attack does ongoing damage, and they also have the same Tail Sweep
attack as the macetails. In addition to the usual Recharge 4-6 on the sweep,
they get to do another one as a free action when first bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>The suggested encounter is level 7 and has a troop of troglodytes
(shaman+muscle) using a macetail behemoth as armored support. It’s a all-reptile
theme group!</p>

<p>Personally, I’d also add behemoths to human or elven forces. Maybe that merchant
caravan you were hired to protect is a train of macetails instead of the mules
you’d normally expect, and when brigands attack keeping the beasts from going
berserk is as much of a challenge as the fight itself.</p>

<p>It’s true! I mean, it’s common for fantasy settings to have items made of one or
more fantastic materials in them, but Tamriel (the setting of Skyrim and other
Elder Scrolls games) goes the extra mile by naming its selection after
completely different real-world materials. So you get things like high-end armor
made from “refined malachite”, which in our world is also known as “copper”.</p>

<p>GURPS takes a more realistic approach, so when adapting this stuff to GURPS you
need to modify it a little. Here are some Tamrielic cultures written in a format
similar to the one shown in <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy Treasures 1: Glittering
Prizes</strong>, and slightly modified to fit better with GURPS DF. Page references
are given for published game effects, and full stats are given to new ones.</p>

<p>I’m mostly basing myself on Skyrim here, since that’s what I played the
most. Any differences between the material below and official lore can be either
born of my ignorance of the overall setting or a change I made on purpose to fit
what I find interesting.</p>

<h2 id="the-nords-of-skyrim">The Nords of Skyrim</h2>

<p>These are pretty much your standard off-brand Vikings. Nords were some of the
first humans to arrive on the continent of Tamriel, sailing into frosty Skyrim
from even frostier Altmora thousands of years ago. They typically value martial
prowess and distrust magic, though there are also plenty of peaceful or
mystically-inclined Nords.</p>

<p>Present-day Nord artisans usually disdain fancy or “impossible” materials,
placing greater value on the skill that goes into making an object. Clothing is
sturdy, warm, and predominantly made of wool and cotton. Fancier attire tends to
be quilted, vividly dyed and/or trimmed with fur. Jewelry consists of rings,
chains or amulets made from precious metals and often jeweled. Cold-weather gear
made mostly from furs is also a common sight.</p>

<p>Weapons and armor are mostly made from plain old steel. Nords like one-handed
swords and axes, usually wielded with round medium shields. Spears (1- or
2-handed) are also popular, with regular and long bows being the premier ranged
weapons. Armor tends to be mail, scale or plate, and is often fur-lined for
extra protection against the cold. This gear is commonly decorated with carved
reliefs of spiral patterns, or with motifs depicting wolves, bears and
eagles. Nords love horned helmets, though they prefer the look of curled ram
horns rather than the straight ones usually depicted in more cliche Viking
imagery.</p>

<p><em>Ancient</em> Nords were similar, though they were bigger fans of magic. Many
ancient weapons that survive to this day are enchanted or feature “impossible”
embellishments like solid quicksilver inlays. Some ancient Nord smiths even made
weapons and armor entirely from that material. Ancient Nord decoration often
features a dragon motif in addition to the others present in modern day items.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics">Game Statistics</h3>

<p><strong>Fur-Lined</strong>: Fur-lined armor acts as winter clothing, removing HT penalties to
resist FP loss from cold. Even if the GM isn’t using detailed rules for that,
they can still declare that such protection is required to enter particularly
inhospitable places (like the Ice Caverns of the Frost Wyrm). +1 CF.</p>

<p>Most Nord gear has no inherent CF or reaction modifier, particularly in a
campaign set in Skyrim or whatever your world’s own Nord-land is. Fine-quality
and Ornate +1 gear is relatively common, though.</p>

<h2 id="high-elves">High Elves</h2>

<p>The High Elves of Tamriel, also known as the Altmer, enthusiastically live up to
every “snobby elf” stereotype. As a culture, they see themselves as direct
descendants of the gods, trapped in mortal flesh when the world was
created. This often manifests of a disdain for the other, more “worldly”
peoples, and as a distressing tendency to form ruthless elven supremacist
organizations.</p>

<p>Unlike the Nords, High Elves go all in on using fancy or impossible materials
for everyday items. Clothing tends towards regal robes of elaborately woven and
dyed silk with gold thread embroidery, featuring wing, bird, and solar
motifs. Gold jewelry is prized, particularly rings, earrings and hair
ornaments. “Fake it till you make it” is the order of the day among high elves
that can’t afford the genuine article.</p>

<p>Elven armorers eschew ferrous metals in favor of bronze, and will prefer to use
more “magical” substances like refined moonstone or tempered glass if they can
get their hands on them. Their preferred weaponry runs to fencing weapons and
fancy polearms, as well as composite bows. For armor they like shiny mail and
light plate suits. Wings and solar disks or rays are also common decorative
motifs for elven armor and weapons, either carved in relief or inlaid in gold or
solid quicksilver. Gilding is also quite popular.</p>

<p>Note that the leven of ornamentation of a piece of elven gear doesn’t have
anything to do with its quality - it’s quite common for very ornate pieces to be
of otherwise standard quality.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics-1">Game Statistics</h3>

<p>Altmer bows and mail armor always carry the <strong>Elven</strong> modifier. Elven “mail”
here is actually light plate armor. It has the same DR and weight, and can have
modifiers that apply to plate armor.</p>

<p><strong>Bronze</strong>: In Dungeon Fantasy bronze weapons and armor have exactly the same
stats and price as their steel equivalents. They’re just, well,
bronze-colored.</p>

<p><strong>Refined Moonstone</strong>: Magically reinforced aluminum! This is an “implausible
material” like those found on DF 8 or DF Treasures 1. It’s conductive but not
flammable. Items made of refined moonstone have a silvery, pearlescent color. +4
CF.</p>

<p><strong>Tempered Glass</strong>: This is described in DF 8 for weapons. Plate or scale armor
can also be made of tempered glass. Such armor has +6 CF, is neither flammable
nor conductive, and makes you look like you’re wearing a Tiffany lamp.</p>

<p>High Elven gear has no inherent CF modifier, though it’s usually expensive
because of all the ornamentation it carries. In places and times where those
elven supremacist organizations are around, wearing Altmer gear gets you a -2
reaction penalty from pretty much everyone. Unless you happen to be a High Elf
yourself, in which case other High Elves (only) will not react at a penalty.</p>

<h2 id="dark-elves">Dark Elves</h2>

<p>The Dark Elves of Tamriel, also known as Dunmer, hail from the distant
ash-choked plains of Morrowind, a place with little metal but plenty of
monstrous giant bugs. As such, many of their durable goods tend to be made out
of chitin and bone rather than metal or stone.</p>

<p>Dunmer clothing is made out of tough fabric, dyed in drab or dark tones. Fancier
outfits are more colorful and have arabesque patterns made using embroidery or
block printing, and might include elaborate hats. Weapons and armor are made out
of expertly molded chitin or bone more often than they’re made of metal, and
it’s pretty much inevitable that they’ll be “decorated” do look like bugs or
skeletons due to that.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics-2">Game Statistics</h3>

<p><strong>Chitin</strong>: Chitin armor tends to be smooth and slightly shiny, and is usually
brown or black in color. There’s a bewildering variety of giant bugs in
Morrowind, so any leather, scale or plate armor can be made from chitin. +1 CF.</p>

<p><strong>Bone</strong>: Described in DF 8 and DF Treasures 1.</p>

<p>Items of Dunmer make have no inherent CF modifiers. People unfamiliar with
chitin and bone armor might react to the wearer at -1 or worse.</p>

<h2 id="the-dwarves">The Dwarves</h2>

<p>There are no Dwarves in Tamriel. For some reason the whole civilization just up
and vanished centuries ago, leaving behind a whole lot of ruins filled with
automaton guardians and other still-functioning machinery.</p>

<p>There isn’t any dwarf clothing left to describe - as far as the surviving
accounts go, no one saw them wear anything but heavy armor. Dwarven weapons and
armor, as well as most of their durable goods, are made of an advanced metal
alloy no one else knows how to produce. It can be molded in a standard forge
just fine, though. This makes raiding dwarven ruins for their metal fittings a
profitable, if risky, endeavor. All of these items are often decorated with
engraved geometric patterns made out of straight lines. Ancient dwarven helmets
look like sculpted faces - in fact, people in full dwarven plate don’t look much
different than one of their constructs.</p>

<p>Dwarves seem to have favored one-handed maces and axes, used with heavy metal
shields. For ranged combat, they used crossbows of varying complexity.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics-3">Game Statistics</h3>

<p>Dwarven weapons and armor always have the <strong>Dwarven</strong> modifier where
applicable. Genuine Dwarven antiques can be sold at an extra +3 CF to
collectors.</p>

<h2 id="the-orcs">The Orcs</h2>

<p>Elder Scrolls Orcs are not considered monsters, and have been a part of
civilized society for a long time. Still, they love fighting even more than
Nords do, and a significant percentage of them are devout worshippers of the God
of Having a Chip on Your Shoulder.</p>

<p>Traditional orc clothing is made from light and breathable fabrics, dyed in
bright colors and some times adorned with quilting or embroidery. Brimless
cylindrical hats are commonly worn by men. “Hardcore” orcs go live in isolated
enclaves where they embrace the “Barbarian Hero” aesthetic of crude hide and
canvas tunics and loincloths. Both types of orc take immense pride in their
ability to craft weapons and armor, though.</p>

<p>Orcs favor nasty serrated blades as weapons, and elaborate suits of plate for
armor - preferrably spiked. The more ornate versions have extensive and
elaborate arabesque reliefs. Orc armorers never use exotic materials solely for
decoration, but they have great love for meteoric iron and orichalcum due to
their useful properties. Orcs take their smithing quite seriously, and orc-made
gear has a higher than usual chance of being Fine-quality or better.</p>

<h3 id="game-statistics-4">Game Statistics</h3>

<p>Orc gear has no inherent CF modifier or reaction bonus.</p>

<p>Serrated weapons are presented in DF Treasures 1, and spiked armor is in DF 1 or
Adventurers.</p>
