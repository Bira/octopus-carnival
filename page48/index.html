<p>D&amp;D Fourth Edition uses “Goblins” to describe a set of closely related species
of humanoids: actual goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears. They’re a very
traditional component of the game and we looked at lots of them in the
MM1/Monster Vault Let’s Read. The post covering their basic lore is <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/22/goblinoids.md">here</a>.</p>

<p>Since the first Manual covered them so well, the second brings us a small number
of more specialized stat blocks for them.</p>

<h2 id="bugbear-wardancer">Bugbear Wardancer</h2>

<p>Wardancers are specialized martial artists. Their weapon of choice is a
two-handed heavy flail, which they swing in wide arcs while moving through enemy
forces in the battlefield. The end result looks something like a dance, thus the
name. There’s a religious element to the art: there are different schools
organized around the worship of different exarchs of Bane, who compete among
each other to see whose war dance is the best.</p>

<p>The wardancer presented here is a Level 6 Skirmisher with 70 HP, low-light
vision, and Speed 7. Its basic attack is a <strong>Flail Dance</strong> that does physical
damage and has a lot of stacked riders: it pushes the target 2 square and knocks
it prone, and also allows the bugbear to shift 1 square. Yes, this is an at-will
basic attack.</p>

<p>The wardancer also has a couple of special attacks. <strong>Flail Barrier</strong> (recharge
5+) does a bit of automatic damage in a burst 2 around the bugbear, and makes it
take half damage from weapon attacks until the end of its next turn. <strong>Flail
Assault</strong> (close burst 2 vs Reflex; encounter) does a bit more damage and knocks
those it hits prone.</p>

<p>All the wardancer’s attacks deal extra damage if it has combat advantage against
the target.</p>

<h2 id="goblin-acolyte-of-maglubyet">Goblin Acolyte of Maglubyet</h2>

<p>Another martial artist, this one a goblin from a sect devoted to Maglubyet. In
previous editions (and again on 5th), Maglubyet is the main goblinoid deity, but
here he’s one of Bane’s Exarchs. His acolytes seek to make themselves in his
image.</p>

<p>The Acolyte is a Level 1 Controller with 29 HP, Speed 6, and low-light
vision. They wield a battleaxe in combat, and back it up with a bit of divine
magic.</p>

<p>Acolytes are surrounded by a <strong>Life Scourge</strong> aura (2) that prevents enemies
inside from recovering hit points. Their basic attack is a <strong>Slashing Shroud</strong>
that consists of an axe strike that also makes the acolyte invisible to the
target until the end if the acolyte’s next turn. A good option against PC
defenders.</p>

<p>They can attack at range with the <strong>Hand of Maglubyet</strong> (ranged 10
vs. Fortitude), a telekinetic attack that deals force damage and either slides
the target 3 squares or immobilizes it for a turn. <strong>Maglubyet’s Fists</strong>
(recharge 5+) allows them to use this attack twice in a single action. So as far
as martial artists go, this is one of those annoying hadouken spammers.</p>

<p>The acolyte also has the standard <strong>Goblin Tactics</strong> power that allows it to
shift 1 square as a reaction when missed by a melee attack. This is what you
would change if you were making acolytes of other species.</p>

<h2 id="lolthbound-goblin">Lolthbound Goblin</h2>

<p>Goblins are generally big on Bane worship, but that’s not universal among
them. This is a goblin whose people have been slaves to the drow for
generations. Their training, and even their physiology, have some important
differences from your usual goblins. They’re clearly meant to be encountered
alongside drow, though for that to work out you’ll need to make those drow lower
level or the goblin higher level.</p>

<p>As written, the Lolthbound Goblin is a Level 3 Soldier with 45 HP. They have
speed 6, and replace the usual low-light vision with full darkvision. They wear
light armor and fight with a war pick.</p>

<p>When Lolthbound Goblins are within 5 squares of a drow, they gain a +2 bonus to
all their attacks and defenses. That <strong>pick</strong> is a high-crit weapon and marks
targets for a turn on a hit. Once per encounter they can use a <strong>Stinging Blow</strong>
that deals poison damage and instead of marking increases any ongoing poison
damage the target is taking by 5. This synergizes with the poisoned weapons drow
so often carry.</p>

<p>Also once per encounter they can use a <strong>Lolthbound Shriek</strong> (close blast 5
vs. Fortitude), which deals light thunder damage to anyone in the area who is
not a drow or spider.</p>

<p>Aside from the usual Goblin Tactics reaction, they also have <strong>Drow Protector</strong>,
an interrupt where the goblin throws himself in front of a drow that’s just been
targetted by an attack, becoming the target instead.</p>

<h2 id="lolthbound-goblin-slave">Lolthbound Goblin Slave</h2>

<p>This is a Level 12 Minion Skirmisher version of the lolthbound goblin above,
which makes it appropriate for use with drow without the need for level
adjustments. They’re also armed with war picks, and add a hand crossbow to their
loadout.</p>

<p>Their basic melee attack is a <strong>Stinging Pick</strong>, which works just like the
Stinging Blow from the regular version. Their basic <strong>crossbow</strong> attack deals a
bit more damage if they’ve moved 3 or more squares before making it.</p>

<p>They also gain the attack and defense bonus from being near drow, and have
Goblin Tactics.</p>

<h2 id="hobgoblin-fleshcarver">Hobgoblin Fleshcarver</h2>

<p>This is the hobgoblin specialized martial artist. Unlike the bugbear and goblin
examples, fleshcarvers don’t seem to have a religious component to their
training. It’s all about hard work and crafting your own custom-fitted
weapons. Their weapons of choice are a polearm and a set of poisoned throwing
darts, whose poison is harvested from serpents they hunt as part of their
training. Fleshcarvers never refuse a challenge to combat, though they’re smart
enough to not let such a challenge distract them in the middle of an ongoing
battle.</p>

<p>Fleshcarvers are Level 6 Elite Controllers with 146 HP. They have Speed 6 and
low-light vision, wear heavy armor, and are armed with the afore-mentioned
specialized weapons.</p>

<p>Their stance and movements act as an aura (2) named <strong>Fleshcarver’s Trap</strong>,
dealing 5 damage to any enemy inside the first time they move during their
turn. Their <strong>glaive</strong> is reach 2 and is used both for basic attacks and for an
at-will <strong>Glaive Flurry</strong> that targets all enemies in a close burst 2, does more
damage than the basic attack, and slides targets 2 squares.</p>

<p>At range they can throw those <strong>Toxic Darts</strong> to do a bit of poison damage and
slow the target (save ends). If the target was already slowed, it’s immobilized
instead. When they’re hit by a melee attack, they can use their reaction to
shift 2 squares and make a dart attack. And finally, fleshcarvers have the same
Hobgoblin Resilience and Phalanx Soldier powers from MM1 hobgoblins.</p>

<p>These hobgoblins are more effective when lots of enemies are in reach, but the
selective targetting on their area attack means they engage all those enemies
while fighting in formation for that sweet defense bonus from Phanlanx Soldier.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters">Sample Encounters</h2>

<p>These new goblinoid specialists can be inserted into any goblin encounter, and
being goblins themselves also work well with any of their typically allied
creatures. These are the encounters we get on the book:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 1: 1 goblin acolyte, 3 goblin warriors, 1 Lolthbound Goblin. It’s likely
the whole group are drow slaves, with the LBG being their leader. The level
math works out, but the LBG’s drow-related skills are wasted here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 2 bugbear wardancers, 2 bugbear warriors, 1 barghest battle lord. A
warlord and their bodyguards.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 6: 1 fleshcarver, 3 hobgoblin soldiers, 2 dire wolves. A patrol with a
little extra kick to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 13: 4 lolthbound goblin slaves, 1 drow priest, 2 blade spiders, 2 drow
warriors. Lots of poison being thrown around on this one, which makes the
minions more dangerous than their level would indicate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I like these new additions, because their stat blocks are interesting and their
associated lore fleshes goblin culture out a bit more. I like that they’re
complex enough to have multiple martial styles.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/09/01/gnome.html">Let&#39;s Read the 4e Monster Manual 2: Gnome</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Gnomes were introduced in the first Monster Manual, and you can see the post I
did on them <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/21/gnome.html.">here</a>. By the time the MM2 came out, they were already available
as a playable option in the Player’s Handbook 2.</p>

<p>We get three new gnome stat blocks in this entry, but one of them (the Gnome
Entropist) also appeared in the Monster Vault and so was covered in the original
post. We’ll cover the other two here.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-mistwalker">Gnome Mistwalker</h2>

<p>Gnome Mistwalkers are like the triple-classed fighter/illusionist/thieves of
yore. They’re skilled at illusion magic and melee combat, using those to ambush
their targets. This sort of training is common among gnome brigands, who build
elaborately disguised hideouts and strike at merchants passing along nearby
trade routes.</p>

<p>Mistwalkers are Level 5 Lurkers with 51 HP and all standard gnome traits
(including the Fade Away and Reactive Stealth powers described in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/21/gnome.html.">original
post</a>). They wear light armor and wield picks in combat.</p>

<p>The <strong>picks</strong> have the High-Crit property, and they deal extra damage to targets
granting them combat advantage. <strong>Mistwalker’s Strike</strong> (recharge 4+) allows
them to become invisible until the end of their next turn, shift 2 squares, and
make a pick attack in that order. This means the attack will always benefit from
the extra damage, and won’t disrupt the invisibility.</p>

<p>In addition to the two standard powers, they have a third defensive ability in
the form of <strong>Blur of Movement</strong>, a reaction that allows them to teleport 1
square when hit by an enemy.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-entropist">Gnome Entropist</h2>

<p>Their mechanics were covered in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/21/gnome.html.">original post</a>, but here we get a bit of
extra lore on them. Entropists are magicians whose power flows from the
Elemental Chaos. This tends to interfere with their natural link to the Feywild,
so they’re not usually the most stable of gnomes.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-wolverine">Gnome Wolverine</h2>

<p>This gnome is the best at what it does, and what it does ain’t pretty, bub. And
that’s pretty much all you need to know to understand this short berserker.</p>

<p>Wolverine is a Level 9 Skirmisher with 95 HP, lightly armored and wielding an
axe. His natural speed of 5 becomes 7 on a charge, and he has a +3 to AC against
opportunity attacks plus the standard gnome powers.</p>

<p>That <strong>axe</strong> can be used for basic strikes and for an <strong>Unbalancing Swipe</strong> that
does the same damage, slides the target 2 squares on a hit and knocks then prone
on a critical. When the Wolverine drops an enemy to 0 HP, <strong>Vicious Fury</strong>
allows him to shift 5 squares and gain a +3 bonus to damage rolls until the end
of his next turn. Once per encounter, and once again after being bloodied,
Wolverine can use a <strong>Shrieking Strike</strong> that’s much stronger than the basic
attack and does a bit of splash damage to an enemy adjacent to the target. Hit
or miss, it grants Wolverine a +3 bonus to all defenses until the end of his
next turn. This can be used as part of a charge.</p>

<p>Despite my joking, this Wolverine doesn’t regenerate.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We have two sample encounters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 8: 1 entropist, 2 wolverines, 2 spriggan giantsouls.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 10: 3 entropists, 2 phase spiders, 1 satyr piper, and 1 will-o’-wisp.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All seem to be the sort of gnome who’s up to no good, since they include the
dodgier sort of fey (spriggans/redcaps and the wisp).</p>

<p>I like 4e gnomes, so I liked seeing more of them. The wolverine is particularly
fun, because it goes so hard against type.</p>

<a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/20/gnoll.html">MM1/Monster Vault gnoll post</a>. The Deathpledged Gnoll, Fang of Yeenoghu, and

            <p>The first Monster Manual and the Monster Vault contained plenty of giants, whose
lore in 4e is pretty awesome. I covered their basic lore <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/30/giants.html">here</a>, and also had
individual posts for <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/01/earth-giants.html">hill</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/04/frost-giants.html">frost</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/06/fire-giants.html">fire</a>, <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/07/death-giants.html">death</a> and <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/10/storm-giants.html">storm</a>
giants.</p>

<p>The Monster Manual 2 added more giants, and it’s actually where Frost Giants
made their first appearance in this edition. We already covered them in the
corresponding post linked above. In this one, we’ll cover the two other
varieties introduced in the same entry: Eldritch and Stone giants. The latter
are old standbys, and I had never heard of the former until now. If they existed
in a previous edition, it was in one of the more out-of-the-way supplements or
Dragon articles for 3e.</p>

<h2 id="eldritch-giants">Eldritch Giants</h2>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm2-4e-giant-eldritch.png"/>

</figure>

<p>As mentioned in the basic lore post, the primordials made the first Giants from
the same elements they used in the world, to help them shape and understand
it. Well, it turns out <em>raw magic</em> is as much a basic building block of the
world as the more classical elements of earth, fire, air, and water. Therefore,
it got its own Giant type.</p>

<p>Eldritch giants were among the most powerful creations of the Primordials, and
they helped a lot with shaping the flow of magical energies in the still-cooling
world. Today their power is much diminished from what it was at the dawn of
time, and most of them dedicate their lives to accumulating magical power and
knowledge in hopes of returning to those lofty heights.</p>

<p>Both eldritch giants and titans are still well-versed in magic. They know how to
form weapons out of pure force, and they tattoo their bodies with symbols that
allow them to absorb the magic of others and teleport at will. They live near
sources of arcane power, and jealously hoard knowledge and artifacts. Eldritch
giant social hierarchy is based on how much power individuals managed to
accumulate - Eldritch Titans tend to be at the top. An individual eldritch giant
or titan might have more abilities than what is depicted in the “typical” stat
blocks of this entry, and they’ll certainly have access to lots and lots of
magic rituals.</p>

<p>Most interactions between mortals and eldritch giants as written here are likely
to be hostile, since the giants don’t have much reason to be friendly. They love
binding and enslaving other creatures with magic, though, so they might be
encountered alongside powerful elementals, slaads, and other such creatures. A
more reasonable group of them would make valuable allies against powerful
incorporeal enemies, though, since they specialize in force magic.</p>

<h3 id="eldritch-giant">Eldritch Giant</h3>

<p>“Standard” eldritch giants are Large Fey Humanoids with the “giant”
keyword, and Level 18 Skirmishers with 171 HP. They have low-light vision, 10
force resistance, and a +5 bonus to saves vs. charm effects. Their ground speed
is 8 and they also have a teleport speed of 6.</p>

<p>These giants fight in melee with Reach 2 <strong>Eldritch Blades</strong> that target Reflex
and deal force damage, and at range with Range 20 <strong>Force Missiles</strong> that do the
same. Being so large, they can also use <strong>Sweeping Sword</strong> attacks to target
everyone in a Close Blast 2 instead of a single victim, and they can do that
even when charging.</p>

<p>As a minor action, they can deploy an <strong>Eldritch Field</strong> (close blast 5; recharge
5+) that counts as difficult terrain and makes enemies inside take extra damage
from the their attacks. Also as a minor action, they can use <strong>Consume Magic</strong>
to absorb a magic zone created by a PC. This requires them to hit the caster’s
Will with an attack, and if they succeed their own attacks get a big damage
boost until the end of their next turn.</p>

<h3 id="eldritch-titan">Eldritch Titan</h3>

<p>Eldritch Titans are Huge, and Level 21 Elite Skirmishers with 394 HP. They have
the same passive traits as their smaller cousins.</p>

<p>Their Reach 3 <strong>Eldritch Hammers</strong> deal more damage, and they can make two
attacks per action, even on a charge. Their ranged force attack is also stronger
and pushes the target 5 squares on a hit.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can cast a <strong>Force Hammer</strong> that damages everyone on a
close blast 3, pushes then 3 squares and knocks them prone. On a miss the
targets still take half damage and are pushed. They have the same Consume Magic
and Eldritch Field abilities as eldritch giants.</p>

<h2 id="stone-giants">Stone Giants</h2>

<p>The other type of classic earth giant, Stone Giants are among the most
reasonable people among all giantkind. They usually don’t care about raiding or
conquest, and just want to be left alone in their mountain homes. Discrete and
contemplative sorts, they can stay immobile for years while lost in thought, and
are surprisingly adept at hiding themselves in their home terrain.</p>

<p>Someone passing throug stone giant territory might never spot them at all, and
ill-intentioned travelers might find themselves ambushed before they can do any
harm. The exception to all of this is when the giants are feeling rowdy and want
to have some fun: their favorite game is basically dodgeball with enormous
boulders, and when they’re in the middle of it they don’t usually pay attention
to any smaller creatures who might be in the path of those boulders.</p>

<p>Stone giants are one of the few Giants who are actually on friendly terms with
communities of galeb duhrs and azers. They have a long and proud tradition of
stone carving, and their magic is based on carved runes. It’s possible the
dwarves originally learned their own rune-magic from stone giants, though modern
dwarf scholars dispute this notion.</p>

<p>Friendly giants of other types, unable to stand their generally unpleasant
societies, often move in with stone giants. Conversely, evil stone giants tend
to move out of their ancestral homes and throw their lot with their more
villainous relatives.</p>

<h3 id="stone-giant">Stone Giant</h3>

</figure>

<p>Stone Giants are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Earth and Giant
keywords. They’re Level 14 Soldiers with 140 HP, immune to petrification, and
have a ground speed of 8 with Earth Walk. This lets them ignore difficult
terrain with a “geological” origin.</p>

<p>They use giant-sized <strong>stone greatclubs</strong>. As usual for soldiers, their basic
attacks mark on a hit and they can make opportunity attacks marked creatures in
reach that move or shift. They can also make a <strong>Staggering Sweep</strong> that works
like an area attack, pushes targets 2 squares, and marks them. At range, they
can <strong>hurl rocks</strong> like you’d expect out of an old-school giant.</p>

<p>While they’re unbloodied, they can use <strong>Stone Bones</strong> as an interrupt when hit
by an attack, gaining 5 resistance do its damage.</p>

<h3 id="stone-giant-runecarver">Stone Giant Runecarver</h3>

<p>This spellcaster is a Level 16 Controller with 155 HP and the Leader
keyword. Their magic is partly about slowing and immobilizing enemies, and
partly about doing unpleasant things to enemies suffering from those conditions.</p>

<p>They fight in melee with <strong>Enruned Picks</strong>, which are High-Crit weapons and have
a slow (save ends) rider. <strong>Grasping Stone</strong> ensures that any enemy slowed by
the giant is also immobilized for a turn.</p>

<p>Magic-wise, their <strong>Rune of Thundering Echo</strong> (recharge 5+) deals thunder damage
over an area and inflicts ongoing thunder damage (save ends) on targets who are
slowed or immobilized. The <strong>Rune of Stony Sleep</strong> (recharge 6+) affects a
similar area, deals physical damage and slows (save ends). After the first
failed save, slowed enemies become petrified instead (save still ends). That
rune also creates a zone within its affected area that inflicts a -2 penalty
against saves vs. slowness or immobilization effects.</p>

<p>“Save ends” petrification might not sound so bad, but runecarvers also have a
<strong>Hardened Focus</strong> aura (5) that makes all petrified enemies inside lose any
damage resistance they have <em>and</em> gain Vulnerable 5 to all damage. An evil
runecarver is a good counter to a group of PCs who thought a fight against frost
or fire giants was going to be easy just because they packed the right elemental
resistances.</p>

<h3 id="stone-titan">Stone Titan</h3>

<p>Stone Titans are basically Stone Giants Plus, being Huge in size and Level 18
Elite Soldiers with 348 HP. They fight unarmed and throw rocks, but there are
some important differences.</p>

<p>First, their marking ability is a <strong>Slipstone Distortion</strong> aura (1) that marks
any enemy who starts their turn inside. Their <strong>slams</strong> deal extra damage to
marked enemies, and they can make opportunity attacks against marked enemies
like stone giants can.</p>

<p>Second, they can use an <strong>Avalanche Stomp</strong> (encounter) to attack everyone in a
Close Burst 3, with a hit doing heavy damage and causing the very earth to grab
the targets. The escape DC is 28, and the giant doesn’t need to spend actions to
sustain the grab. A miss still does half damage.</p>

<p>And third, they can “charge” a thrown rock and turn it into a <strong>Quakestone</strong>
(recharge 5+), making it into an area attack that does light damage, knocks
prone, and dazes (save ends) on a hit. A miss does half damage and knocks prone
without the daze.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Eldritch giants have a somewhat unusual name and appearance when compared to the
traditional types, but they’re a lot closer to them than it seems at first. I
guess calling them “Force Giants” would have been a little too on the nose, but
this is basically what they are. They use Force attacks in the same way a frost
giant would use Cold, or a fire giant would use Fire. Their fighting style is
similar, aside from the “I eat magic!” thing.</p>

<p>Stone giants on the other hand are one of the traditional types that have been
there since the beginning. I’m happy to see them here because your average stone
giant fits the “Earth Giant” mold a lot more readily than a hill giant, who’s
just a big human-looking person. I also like that the book doesn’t consider all
of them evil, and even mentioned that they partner up with non-evil individuals
of the other giant types. I often ponder how to make sapient monsters less evil
and hostile when I discuss them, so it’s nice to see an entry that does that as
written.</p>

<p>The first Monster Manual already includes a bunch of <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/03/18/ghost.html">ghosts</a>, and it even
has a basic Phantom Warrior. Here we have a more specific implementation of that
concept.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>These creatures are the ghosts of soldiers who died in battle more or less at
the same time as the entire rest of their units. The emotional bonds between
them and the trauma of their violent massed deaths causes their spirits to fuse
and to rise as undead.</p>

<p>Legionnaires always appear as a unit, and they look like individuals acting in
concert, but they’re all part of the same collective ghost. So it might have
been more accurate to title this entry “Ghost <em>Legion</em>”. Members of the legion
can possess the living and make them experience the soldiers’ last moments.</p>

<p>When a ghost legionnaire is damaged, it always displays the wounds it suffered
in its final battle rather than the ones that were actually inflicted on it. So
a squad killed by some wizard’s acid-infused fireball would grow progressively
more burned and melted as the PC paladin stabs them.</p>

<p>A ghost legion might be endlessly reliving its last battle when found, seeing
any living intruders as their enemies. It might also be following the orders of
a more powerful undead being, particularly if that being was one of its
commanders in life.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>An individual legionnaire is a Medium Natural Humanoid with the Undead keyword,
and a Level 13 Soldier with 100 HP. Despite being a ghost, it’s not considered
insubstantial, but it has 10 necrotic resistance and isn’t especially vulnerable
to radiant damage.</p>

<p>Legionnaires fight with the same weapons they had in life, making <strong>devastating
cuts</strong> with their melee weapons or shooting <strong>ghost arrows</strong> that do necrotic
damage. They can also use their <strong>Battle Visions</strong> power to possess a
target. This has range 20, targets Will and deals psychic damage with a Dominate
(save ends) rider. While the target is dominated, the ghost is removed from the
map. When the target finally makes their save, the ghost reappears in an
adjacent space.</p>

<p>This ghost’s main weakness takes the form of a trait named <strong>Call to
History</strong>. It allows a PC to make a DC 25 History check as a minor action to
recall details about the legionnaire’s original unit. A success here makes the
PC’s next attack against that ghost deal 10 extra damage. I don’t think you can
stack multiple checks in a single attack, but you <em>can</em> make a check every turn
before you attack. Someone who was possessed and made their save has a +5 bonus
to these tests for the rest of the fight, as those horrifying battle visions act
as extra reference material.</p>

<p>The collective nature of a ghost legion is expressed by the <strong>Soul Link</strong>
trait. Basically, you combine the HP totals of all legionnaires present in the
fight into a single pool. Damage to any individual legionnaire is subtracted
from this combined pool. The whole unit is destroyed when this pool is reduced
to 0, but until that happens all legionnaires remain in the fight! This makes
the usual “focus fire” strategy considerably less effective against them.</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is Level 15, and quite straightforward: a 5-ghost unit and
a human lich wizard from the MM. A Nerathi squad plus their former commanding
officer.</p>

<p>I really like the “collective HP” gimmick! It shouldn’t be too hard to add or
subtract levels from the stat block given here, either, meaning you can bring
the Fun (TM) of ghost legions to the party no matter what their
level.</p>

<p>There isn’t much of a story difference between a ghost legionnaire and a phantom
warrior, as you can see by their names. This suggests that one way to get a
level 4 legionnaire would be to remove Insubstantial from the warrior and add
Soul Link in its place. You can likely do the same with any other thesaurus
buddies that might come along (banshee battlers, figment fighters, spectral
soldiers, wraith warriors…).</p>
