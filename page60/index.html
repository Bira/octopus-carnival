<p>I’ve been somewhat lax in following the monthly themes proposed by the GURPS
blogging community. Let’s see if we can change that! This month’s theme is
“Luck”, so let’s see what I can do about it.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-dramatic-editing">What is Dramatic Editing?</h2>

<p>If I’m supposed to write about “Luck”, why did I title this article “Dramatic
Editing”? That’s the name of a rule in the old White Wolf RPG <strong>Adventure!</strong>,
which was about pulp heroes with special powers in the 1920’s. It used a variant
of the Storyteller system, with a “power stat” named Inspiration. In addition to
powers specific to their character types, all PCs in <strong>Adventure!</strong> could pay
points of Inspiration to change the narrative around them. In-character, this
looked like lucky coincidence, but mechanically it was a conscious decision by
the player. The less plausible the change was, the more Inspiration it
cost. This rule was called Dramatic Editing.</p>

<h2 id="hasnt-this-been-done-in-gurps-before">Hasn’t This Been Done in GURPS Before?</h2>

<p>Why, yes! GURPS has several different sets of rules that strongly resemble
<strong>Adventure!’s</strong> Dramatic Editing. Let’s count them.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Basic Set</strong> alone, we have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>Luck</strong> family of advantages, which allow periodic re-rolling certain
tests and picking the best result. Higher levels increase the frequency in
which this can be done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Super Luck</strong>, which allows the player to outright dictate the result of a
roll, once per real-time hour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Serendipity</strong>, which is very similar to Dramatic Editing but with more GM
control and less guidelines as to what’s possible. Each level of the advantage
gives one “use” per session.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After that we have <strong>GURPS Power-Ups 5: Impulse Buys</strong>, which is a whole
supplement on the different ways you can spend character points to buy immediate
effects. Of particular interest there are the mechanics for <strong>Buying Success</strong>
on p. 16, which at the extreme end can turn a critical failure into a critical
success for 5 CP.</p>

<p>Building on that we have the expanded mechanics for Wildcard Skills that debut
in <strong>GURPS Monster Hunters 1: Champions</strong>: for every 12 points spent in a
wildcard skill, you also gain a “point” that can be used for Buying
Success on rolls of that skill.</p>

<p>These mysterious “points” never had an official name until the Impulse Control
article in <strong>Pyramid #3/100</strong>, which called them Impulse Points and gave us a
rule set for purchasing them as advantages.</p>

<p>With that many alternatives, why I am even writing this post? Most of various
official mechanics don’t really feel unified. If I wanted a game where Dramatic
Editing was central, having several of these mechanics in place would be
confusing, especially for new players. I also don’t like that the default
Impulse Buys rule requires permanent expenditures of character points. The rules
associated with Wildcard skills are nifty, but they require bringing Wildcard
Skills into the campaign and that isn’t always appropriate.</p>

<p>If I was to use a single official rule set for this, it would be the one from
the Pyramid article, but I find even it to be a little too finnicky. You have to
pay for your Impulse Point pool and for its refresh rate separately, which means
your group can have PCs with <em>different refresh rates</em>. The idea of Villain
Points from the article is also pretty good, but making them a fixed
disadvantage that also has an individually adjustable refresh rate makes them
both predictable and difficult to track.</p>

<p>This can only mean one thing: time to come up with my own system!</p>

<h2 id="dramatic-editing-gurps-edition">Dramatic Editing, GURPS Edition</h2>

<p>This system is meant for campaigns where dramatic editing is a major
feature. Its use replaces any other traits meant to represent luck, plot
protection, or lack thereof. It is inspired several of those traits, by the
Dramatic Editing rules in <strong>Adventure!</strong>, and by similar systems found in a few
other games.</p>

<p>Note that these rules use “dramatic” units of time rather than the more
traditional GURPS measurements of sessions or periods of real or game time. I
prefer to use these units because I often play via forum, where real time and
sessions don’t have any meaning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An <em>adventure</em> is a complete story with beginning, middle and end, bookended
by significant periods of downtime. In a face-to-face game, it can take several
sessions to complete!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <em>scene</em> is a usually series of events taking place in the same location, or
something like a single big fight, chase, or significant social encounter. It
usually ends when the characters have some time to rest or when the context of
their activities changes. A session usually has several scenes, unless the whole
session is just one big fight.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The system is built around the following advantage:</p>

<h3 id="inspiration-15-pointslevel">Inspiration (15 points/level)</h3>

<p>Whether you’re lucky or just that good, you often find things going your
way. Each level of this advantage gives you an Inspiration Point (IP for short),
which you can spend in the ways described in <strong>GURPS Power-Ups 5: Impulse
Buys</strong>, or in <em>Performing Dramatic Editing</em>, below.</p>

<p>The GM defines how many levels of Inspiration you may buy in the campaign. 3 to
5 should be a typical maximum, depending on how cinematic the campaign is. This
advantage is exclusive to PCs, representing the extraordinary luck or “plot
armor” posessed by protagonists in heroic fiction. NPC adversaries use a
slightly different system. Its use in a campaign implies the use of the rules
described below, which apply to all PCs whether they have this advantage or not!</p>

<h3 id="regaining-inspiration">Regaining Inspiration</h3>

<p>Inspiration Points can refresh in several different ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They always fully refresh at the start of every new <em>adventure</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the downtime between <em>scenes</em> of an adventure, you regain 1 or more IP
depending on how long the downtime lasted, at the GM’s discretion. A
five-minute break while running between fight scenes doesn’t refresh anything,
while multiple days of R&amp;R are always worth a full refresh.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You gain an IP for particularly good roleplaying during a scene and for heroic
actions, at the GM’s discretion. Fortune favors the bold!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The GM may give your character 1 or more IP in exchange for inserting negative
events into the narrative. Essentially, this allows the GM to buy success or
use dramatic editing by giving points to the PCs instead of spending them from
a pool.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Points gained through impressive heroics or GM dramatic editing can allow a
character to exceed their Inspiration maximum, and even characters without the
Inspiration advantage can make use of them! These extra points are lost when the
scene ends, so there is extra incentive to use them immediately.</p>

<h3 id="performing-dramatic-editing">Performing Dramatic Editing</h3>

<p>In addition to buying success or improving effect rolls, PCs can use Inspiration
to directly alter the narrative around them. While this is a conscious decision
by the player, and fueled by the PC’s Inspiration, the PC is not aware of this
fact, and perceives this as a stroke of luck or fortunate coincidence. This is
usually done to get the character out of danger, or to improve their odds
against strong opposition. The more extensive and implausible the change, the
more it costs.</p>

<p>Dramatic editing is always initiated by the <em>player</em>, unlike Serendipity, though
the GM still may veto or alter edits that violate basic campaign assumptions,
exceed the scope the player wants to pay for, utterly break suspension of
disbelief, or which simply don’t contribute to making a fun and exciting
session. Players should come up with plausible explanations as to why these
things happened, and GMs are encouraged to ask for clarification if anything is
in doubt.</p>

<p>In any case, using dramatic editing to cause problems for other players is
forbidden!</p>

</table>

<p>Below are more detailed descriptions of the possible changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Minor Change</strong>: This change has a minor but not decisive impact on the
character’s situation, improving their odds and perhaps giving them some room
to breathe. It must be plausible given the current situation, and cannot
contradict any established narration. It can do things like bring in plausible
friendly NPCs as reinforcements, insert useful objects into the scenery, or
give the PC an extra bit of equipment they forgot they brought (like the more
specialized Gizmo advantage). The guidelines for standard <strong>Serendipity</strong> are
good here, too.</p>

    <p><em>Examples</em>: There’s a loaded gun in a desk drawer in that penthouse executive
office! These sturdy vines will make crossing that jungle chasm easier!
Friendly police officers show up when they hear you fighting those mobsters
near their station!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Major Change</strong>: This change has a decisive impact on the character’s
situation, turning lost causes into decent fighting chances or perhaps saving
the character’s life entirely from certain death. It can stretch plausibility
somewhat, but it still cannot contradict established narration and must adhere
to the campaign’s base assumptions.</p>

    <p><em>Examples</em>: There’s a <em>parachute</em> in that burning penthouse executive office!
Those cops that showed up and arrested everyone know your PCs from way back
and are willing to release them with a warning… this time. This idling,
unlocked sports car that happens to be here is just what you need to give
chase to the bad guys!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blatant Continuity Violation</strong>: This change <em>can</em> directly contradict a
previously established description, though it still might not violate basic
campaign assumptions.</p>

    <p><em>Examples</em>: Turns out the building’s sprinkler system is working after
all! The lab had a backup generator the bad guys didn’t know about! This
unexplored jungle contains a ruined outpost full of supplies!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Extension</strong>: Allows a player to “hitch a ride” on an edit just performed by
another player, having its effects apply to both PCs. Cost depends on the
scope of the original change (minor extensions cost 1 IP, major ones cost 2).</p>

    <p><em>Examples</em>: That vine is a few inches lower than it seemed, allowing both PCs
to grab it! There’s water enough for two!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Offscreen Change</strong>: The edit affects some place other than the one where the
current scene focuses on. This means that it won’t be of immediate help,
taking anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour of in-game time to have an
effect. This reduces the cost of the edit by 1.</p>

    <p><em>Examples</em>: The cops will be here… eventually. That providential supply
cache is a ways away.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Additional Complication</strong>: This change is a mixed blessing - it makes the
PC’s life easier in one way, but complicates it in another. Doing this reduces
the cost of the change by 1, and it’s equivalent to accepting a bad outcome
from the GM in exchange for a point.</p>

    <p><em>Examples</em>: The cops fight the mobsters, but try to arrest you too! The
life-saving supply drop fell on top of a nest of snakes!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="dramatic-editing-vs-buying-success">Dramatic Editing vs. Buying Success</h3>

<p>You might notice that even an immediate Blatant Continuity Violation without
complications is cheaper than turning a Critical Failure into a Critical Success
via the Buying Success rules. The downside of that is that Dramatic Editing is
subject to much more GM scrutiny, as described above, whereas a player can
normally just spend the IP on buying success and have the effects happen
immediately. Generally, anything that could be explained by skill rather than
luck should use the Buying Successes rules.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you might also have noticed that the ability to perform an
edit equivalent to a standard use of <strong>Serendipity</strong> per session costs 30 points
instead of 15! This is balanced by the fact that characters can recover IP
mid-adventure via rest, good roleplaying, heroism, and accepting negative events
proposed by the GM, and that this can allow them to temporarily exceed their
maximum. And they could always spend those points in Buying Success instead if
no good opportunities for “lucky breaks” present themselves.</p>

<h2 id="adjusting-the-rules">Adjusting the Rules</h2>

<p>The Dramatic Editing rules are purposefully written to a more “fuzzy”, narrative
standard than what is usual for GURPS material, and rely a lot on GM and player
judgement. GMs who feel that dramatic editing is too powerful as written are
free to increase the costs, or come up with more concrete limits on what’s
possible. One good way to discourage Blatant Continuity Violations is to set the
maximum Inspiration level for the campaign at 3, ensuring that characters can
only resort to that most extreme of edits if they surpass their maximum or
accept extra complications or delays.</p>

<p>The idea here is that players should use Inspiration early and often. If your
players consistently go over their maximums and stay there, you should either
encourage them to use those points more often or reduce the amount of awarded
points.</p>

<h2 id="compatibility-with-other-systems">Compatibility with Other Systems</h2>

<p>If you use Dramatic Editing in a campaign, you should forbid any other Basic Set
traits that deal with luck, plot protection or the lack thereof. This includes
advantages like <strong>Luck</strong> and <strong>Serendipity</strong>, but also disadvantges like
<strong>Unluckiness</strong>, since players get a different sort of reward for allowing bad
stuff to happen to their characters. Both forms of <strong>Destiny</strong> are also
forbidden, since recent interpretations of it overlap with the Inspiration
advantage.</p>

<p>Using this with “Wilcard points” might be possible, though it makes things
harder to keep track of due to characters having several pools of points to
spend. Points from Wilcard Skills cannot be used for Dramatic Editing, but can
still be used as described in the original rules.</p>

<p>Using this with the Impulse Control rules is relatively straighforward! Simply
allow players to spend Impulse Points on Dramatic Editing, using the same cost
table and guidelines! This does replace the <strong>Serendipity</strong> advantage, but all
other rules remain as in the article.</p>

<p>Welcome to another installment on
my <a href="/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">GURPS X-COM: Noises in the Dark campaign report</a>! Today I’ll continue to
tell you about Operation BRUTAL ADVENT, our group’s inaugural mission. The
following PCs participated in it:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kendall Fairbarn</strong>: A paranoid hacker from the UK. Was completely convinced
human society had been heavily infiltrated by shape-changing aliens… and it
turned out he wasn’t entirely wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Minette Duvall</strong>: A bomb-disposal expert from Southern France, Minette is
also quite handy with a rifle. She’s devoutly Catholic and swears a lot when
faced with danger, which is all the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Niu Yulan (AKA Julia Yulan)</strong>: A former hostage negotiatior from China.
Julia is pretty handy with a rifle but her medical training and innate
kindness are equally important parts of her arsenal.</li>
  <li><strong>Jack Choi</strong>: A former police detective from Hong Kong, and a staunch
adherent of the “kick down the door” school of policing despite his light
frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following NPCs also had important roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Valenkov</strong> and <strong>Gutierrez</strong>: A pair of shooters from Russia and Argentina,
respectively, both members of the squad who lost their players just before the
start of the mission.</li>
  <li><strong>Yevgeny Korsakov</strong>: The pilot of the squad’s Skyranger transport.</li>
  <li><strong>Jan Wiest</strong>: A cop stuck in the anomaly zone. Together with his unit, he’s
been fighting the aliens for months.</li>
  <li><strong>Gisela Vahlen and company</strong>: Seven civilians inhabiting a building inside
the anomaly zone. Three of them are relatives of Dr. Vahlen, one of X-COM’s
top scientists.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="evacuation">Evacuation</h2>

<p>After arriving on the scene and <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/02/25/brutal-advent-part-1.html">investigating the anomaly’s effects</a> the
squad managed to pinpoint its source in the St. Marien Hospital. They decided
they will eventually have to get in there to stop all of this, but rescuing the
civilians should come first. Choi is a little disappointed that they can’t just
call in an airstrike and level the place.</p>

<p>Kendall manages to reach Korsakov, who tells them the Skyranger will be fully
refueled in an hour, but that he can leave ealier if they don’t need to fly a
long distance. Getting them heavier weapons would require flying all the way to
HQ and back, though, which would take a whole day. The local military doesn’t
want to share. The squad asks him to fly in ASAP in order to get the civilians
out.</p>

<p>Korsakov says he’ll be there in 30 minutes, and calls again after that exact
amount of time to request specific landing coordinates. He suggests the roof of
a building just behind the one everyone is in, in the middle of the block. It’s
lower than the surrounding structures, which should provide cover from snipers.</p>

<p>The PCs accept his suggestion, and having prepared to move out with the
civilians in the last half-hour, begin to do so immediately. Just before they
leave the apartment building, however, they get a worrying radio message from
the pilot: “I see a weird light nearby. I will investigate.”</p>

<h2 id="ambush">Ambush!</h2>

<p>This is worrying because Korsakov is never supposed to leave the cockpit during
an extraction, and he knows it. Before the party and the civilians have crossed
half the courtyard, they see him exit through the ground floor door of the
center building and head east at a brisk pace, flight helmet still on. In the
direction he’s walking there’s an eerie blue light shining through an open
second-floor window.</p>

<p>Choi and Kendall rush to the pilot’s side, and notice he’s obviously out of it,
as if hypnotized. He doesn’t stop to talk to them, but doesn’t resist when
physically stopped from walking. The others remain with the refugees, herding
them towards the Skyranger, but Vasily shouts out a warning when he notices that
the blue light is rapidly intensifying. In a second, a ball of fire shoots
towards Choi! He dodges it, and it leaves a small frost-rimmed crater in the
ground.</p>

<p>Minette pours suppressing fire into the window the shot came from, as Choi and
Kendall drop smoke grenades for cover. Julia and the NPCs stay by the civilians
as they run into the building. As the smoke grenades go off, a huge alien
<em>thing</em> jumps out from the window to the left of the one Minette was shooting
at, and disappears into the cloud. They only catch a brief glimpse, but it looks
like a giant seven-fingered hand.</p>

<p>Kendall takes Korsakov’s hand and books it back to the Skyranger. The pilot, now
recovered, is only too happy to run the rest of the way towards the safety of
his cockpit as Julia and the NPC soldiers finish loading the civilians into the
craft. Minette stands ready to shoot the alien if it gets close, but it’s hard
to see into the smoke from this distance.</p>

<p>Choi stays near the smoke, intent on fighting the alien. He fires blindly into
the cloud and hits it, but then the creature charges at him and pokes him in the
chest hard enough to break some ribs despite his body armor. He won’t survive
another hit like that!</p>

<p>Kendall runs back to the fray, followed by Valenkov and Gutierrez. The NPCs fire
burst at it and score a few hits, which do a lot less damage than
expected. The creature swipes at them with its fingers, but thankfully
misses. It hits Kendall with another energy blast, but the hacker’s ridiculous
armor loadout pays off, and he gets away with only a slight frost burn.</p>

<p>Valenkov manages to attract the alien’s attention for long enough to
allow Kendall to stick a greande wrapped in duct-tape on its skin. They get
clear, and the grenade finishes it off. This was their first official close
encounter, and it was only one alien. How many more are there?</p>

<p>They would soon find out. With the civilians clear of the danger zone, it was
time to plan the attack on the alien position at the hospital.</p>

<p>With the campaign already over, it’s safe to spoil you on the alien’s true
nature. It was a Bakegumo (“goblin-spider”), a creature that’s an integral part
of the ecosystem of the Dreams. They do indeed look like giant hands, though the
seven-fingered part was a personal addition: it both made them weirder and
referenced the “mystical” number seven, which I decided would be a recurring
motif in the alien forces. After this encounter, the PCs named it “Rosie” - I
never revealed any of the creature names in the Dreams of Ruin book, an
encouraged players to come up with their own.</p>

<p>The original stats for Bakegumo gave then five hit dice, so my version of them
is large and has exceptional ST and HP. It’s also Unliving, which explains why
bullets didn’t do much against it. It retains <em>all</em> of the original’s
supernatural abilities, so it’s a good thing no one was grappled by it. This one
was a scout, and approached the building in the half-hour between the call going
out and Korsakov arriving.</p>

<p>The party did an excellent job coming up with a plan to quickly evacuate the
civilians: the longer they waited, the more aliens would converge on their
position. Waiting the whole day for more ordinance would bring an overwhelming
attack force a few hours in. Using the grenade at the end was also inspired, and
worth the two uses of Gizmo it cost Kendall. Without that the fight would have
been a lot longer and more costly for the PCs.</p>

<p>They made some mistakes as well: smoke grenades were a total newbie trap in this
game, as the creatures of the Dreams see through a special psychic sense that
completely ignores things that impair normal sight. There was no way to know
this in the first mission, of course, but they would learn the aliens don’t rely
on normal sight if they had autopsied any of them in the strategic
interludes. Alas, this ended up not happening before the game ended.</p>

<p>This post belongs to a series converting Dragon’s Dogma enemies to
<strong>GURPS</strong>. All other entries, and all other posts adapting the setting can be
found <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/dragons-dogma/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Gargoyles in Dragon’s Dogma are pretty much what you’d expect from hearing the
word: humanoid flying monsters with rock-hard skin and a love of clawing out the
eyes of unwary adventurers. The gargoyles of Gransys are living creatures, with
flesh and blood beneath that rock skin, so they add “hunting for food” to their
list of usual reasons for attacking PCs (territoriality, plain cruelty,
etc.). They also have an additional surprise in store: their tails are tipped by
a stinger capable of injecting a petrifying poison into a victim. They can’t eat
the resulting statue, but it’s still a good tactic for finishing off foes who
put up more of a fight than anticipated.</p>

<p>Gargoyles dislike sunlight, and so make their homes in ruins and cave complexes,
particularly those that feature one or more tall chambers full of good nesting
spots. Someone suddenly attacked by a gargoyle in one of these dark places might
confuse them with a harpy at first, only to be surprised at how little effect
their blows have on the creature. Somehow bypassing a gargoyle’s DR is vital to
effectively fighting it.</p>

<p>Welcome to another post in my X-COM: Noises in the Dark actual play report!
These are the PCs that participated in the mission:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Kendall Fairbarn</strong>: A paranoid Hacker from the UK. Was completely convinced
human society had been heavily infiltrated by shape-changing aliens… and it
turned out he wasn’t entirely wrong.</li>
  <li><strong>Minette Duvall</strong>: A bomb-disposal expert from Southern France, Minette is
also quite handy with a rifle. She’s devoutly Catholic and swears a lot when
faced with danger, which is all the time.</li>
  <li><strong>Niu Yulan (AKA Julia Yulan)</strong>: A former hostage negotiatior from China,
built without a template but approaching a shootier Face. Her innate kindness
and empathy came in handy in several of the missions! Julia was ran by three
different players during the lifetime of the campaign, which earns her a medal
for Most Helpful Backup Character.</li>
  <li><strong>Jack Choi</strong>: A former police detective from Hong Kong, and a staunch
adherent of the “kick down the door” school of policing despite his light
frame. Also built without a template. His player dropped out of the planet
near the end of the game, but not before making things <em>interesting</em> for the
rest of the group.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also part of the team were two NPCs: <strong>Valenkov</strong> from Russia and <strong>Gutierrez</strong>
from Argentina, both built using the Shooter archetype. They were originally
PCs, but their players quit <em>before</em> making even a single post and <em>after</em> I had
established they were members of the squad. I always found it funny that Strike
One never had a single PC Shooter who stayed on for a full mission. I mean, the
PCs can shoot, but none of them make it their primary focus.</p>

<h2 id="the-briefing">The Briefing</h2>

<p>As we saw in the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/02/18/x-com-setup.html">previous post</a> in this series, the newly formed X-COM spent
its first month of existence futilely scanning the planet for alien activity
before they found anything actionable. And it came not from their state of the
art spy satellite network, but from a Youtube video recorded by a 12 year old.</p>

<p>Her name was Gisela Vahlen, and she was Dr. Vahlen’s niece. The video was little
more than a standard “family letter” message, recorded on a laptop camera in
Gisela’s room, but anyone who watched could see that a lot was wrong with
it. The girl had the look of someone who had been living in a war zone for
months, and her room looked like part of said war zone. She struggled to
maintain a cheery tone, despite the evident stress she had been under, and spoke
in English instead of her native German.</p>

<p>Despite all the strangeness, a distressed Dr. Vahlen confirmed that it was
indeed her niece, and that was indeed her room, battle damage
notwithstanding. Pointing one of X-COM’s recon satellites at Cologne revealed an
anomaly of some sort covering Gisela’s neighborhood. It looked as if someone had
smudged the camera lens with a greasy finger. Infrared showed the same
thing. And no one else in the world seemed to have noticed it. There were no
news that anything was out of the ordinary in Cologne.</p>

<p>All of this was relayed to Strike One, our PC team, as part of the first
in-character post of the mission. Their goal was to fly to Cologne, ensure the
safety of the civilians in the area, put a stop to the anomaly, and gather
information on the aliens, in that order.</p>

<p>There were some questions, but Mr. Fox was the first to admit their intel was
crap on this op. The only things X-COM knew were the approximate area the
anomaly covered, and that things seemed to be terrible inside it and functioning
normally outside. At least it would be easy to evacuate from the zone.
Dr. Sokolov had already ordered his team to load the Skyranger up with
scientific gear, and all that was left before they were ready to leave was
gearing up.</p>

<h2 id="meet-the-quartermaster">Meet the Quartermaster</h2>

<p>At this point I introduced the party to another NPC: their quartermaster, Nobuo
Ishikawa. This little troll of a man was known as Kappa-san back in the JSDF,
but here everyone calls him Nobby. Because I firmly believe every military
organization in fiction needs a Nobby.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/nobby1.jpg"/>

</figure>

<p>Our Nobby was more than happy to discuss gear selection with the PCs, and to
laugh at Kendall’s ridiculously large wish list that turned the hacker into a
one-man Ghost Hunters show crew. Most of this stuff was already in the
Skyranger, actually, since Sokolov shared his enthusiasm for unveiling alien
secrets.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the gear, I provided the players with a basic list of
weapons, armor and accessories to choose from. My goal with the weapon selection
was to make it similar to the initial list on the computer games, particularly
the 1994 original. The personal firearms were good for fighting people, but a
little on the anemic side when it came to damaging aliens. Then you had things
like grenade launchers and rockets, which were much more powerful but also
heavier and harder to use. No one took those, though they did pick a mix of frag
and smoke hand grenades. Julia also took a bunch of candy to win the kids over
once they arrived.</p>

<h2 id="insertion-and-investigation">Insertion and Investigation</h2>

<p>Once everyone had finished gearing up, it was time to board the Skyranger! It
looked and behaved pretty much like the one in the 2012 computer game, with a
top speed of Mach 1 and enough fuel to cross the Atlantic. It sacrificed
everything else you would expect from a military transport to achieve that,
being relatively tiny and completely unarmed. It was one of those quirky Russian
designs, and those adjectives also fit its pilot Yevgeny Korsakov quite well.</p>

<p>Even at Mach 1, reaching Germany took a while. Once there, Julia asked Korsakov
to do a flyby of the anomaly zone from a safe height. The passenger compartment
didn’t have any windows, but it did have a monitor wired to an external camera,
which showed the same “smudge” as the satellite image. Julia unbuckled and went
to the cockpit to look through the windows, and found that whatever was messing
with the sensors didn’t affect the Mk I Eyeball. The real landscape wasn’t any
prettier, though.</p>

<p>A region of three or so blocks around St. Marien Hospital in Cologne had been
turned into a veritable war zone. The commercial and residendial buildings in
that area had all been shot up and covered in weird graffiti, gutted car wrecks
littered the cracked and cratered streets… the place must have taken months to
reach such a state, and yet the city continued to function normally around it,
as if no one knew what was going on. St. Marien was the same hospital where all
those drugs had gone bad a while back, so whatever caused this must have
happened around then as well.</p>

<p>It was a good thing that the PCs asked Korsakov to be careful with the flyby,
for soon he spotted someone at the roof of the hospital pointing what looked
like an RPG at them! He manages to dodge the missile at the last minute, and
flies out of there.</p>

<p>The PCs discuss what do do next, and Minette came up with the following plan of
attack:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/brutal-advent-lz.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>
    The Area of Operations.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>They’d have Korsakov land about 100 meters to the left of the red X in the
picture above, on a wide avenue. Then they’d use the available cover to make it
into Gisela’s home, the apartment building marked by the yellow dot. Choi was
enthusiastic about kicking the door down, and Julia objected on the grouds that
they were there to rescue civilians, not antagonize them. Minette reasoned that
they might not have a choice, if the door wasn’t open.</p>

<p>The craft landed, and they made a run for it, cover to cover. Once more it was a
good thing that the PCs decided to be cautious about their advance, since a
sniper began taking shots at them from the hospital! Kendall threw a smoke
grenade to cover the advance, though it didn’t seem to do much. Choi emptied his
PDW in the sniper’s general direction while running, which seemed to have a
better effect. Fortunately, all the commotion seemed to have drawn the attention
of the building’s inhabitants, as a man opened the door for the PCs when they
got close enough, and they all scrambled in. Julia paused to take a last,
long-distance shot at the sniper, and apparently hit! No more shots came from
that direction after that.</p>

<p>The building still housed seven civilians: Gisela, her parents, and another
family with father, mother and two children. There was also a cop, Jan Wiest,
who together with Gisela’s father was the informal leader of the bunch. Minette
was proficient in German, and Gisela’s family was proficient in English, so they
managed to communicate acceptably.</p>

<p>Their situation was every bit as bleak and bizarre as it seemed in the
briefing. A few months ago, shortly after news broke out about the hospital’s
drugs all going bad, a large group of people in unmarked military uniforms and
eyeless gas masks appeared in the hospital building and began killing everyone
they came across. They haven’t really been trying to <em>occupy</em> the neighborhood -
they just stage raids out of the hospital, and drag any bodies back with them
when they return.</p>

<p>Wiest’s unit has been fighting them since nearly the beginning, and the
remaining civilians in the area have either been helping or hiding. A lot left
the area as soon as they could - all those that remain (cops and civilians) stay
out of a sense that they must contain the attackers. Wiest calls for backup
every day, but no one ever answered, and no one ever came, until today.</p>

<h2 id="assessment-and-planning">Assessment and Planning</h2>

<p>This story does nothing to answer the PC’s initial doubts: if this has been
going on for so long, how come no one noticed? Kendall uses his skills and
advanced gear to scan the airwaves, only to find them filled with something that
sounds a lot like wailing and gnashing of teeth run through a “creepypasta”
audio filter. It’s like an especially eerie form of jamming, as it prevents him
from reaching HQ or anything outside the anomaly zone. His attempts to get
through it end up revealing what seems to be alien radio chatter… which sounds
exactly like the jamming except for the fact that it also has the cadence of
someone with military training talking over radio. He also scans the laptop
Gisela used to send her video message, but finds it to be a normal Macbook Air
despite the occasional spooky image bleeding through its normal interface.</p>

<p>The squad gets together to discuss what they learned here. The detailed workings
of this anomaly are still a mystery, but it’s clear that it’s somehow preventing
information about what’s going on here from getting out, and it’s likely
affecting the minds of those within as well. The last bit would explain why any
civilians still say in there rather than simply making a run for it. Assuming
it’s being generated by some sort of transmission equipment, its shape indicates
that this equipment is located in the hospital and likely guarded by these
masked alien invaders. They’re going to have to get in there in order to stop
it.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>If you’ve been reading this blog for a while, you’ll know that I’ve already
converted no less than eleven Pathfinder Iconic characters to Dungeon Fantasy,
one for each of the templates from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 1:
Adventurers</strong>. You’ll also know that you can find a handy list of all of them
in <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/projects/pathfinder-iconics">this page</a>, which declares that the project as a whole is done. So why
the heck are you seeing yet another of these articles here?</p>

<p>Well, the simplest reason is because I wanted to do another one. Consider this a
bonus track for the Pathfinder Iconics in Dungeon Fantasy album! As such, it
doesn’t quite follow the rules I set for myself in the main set of eleven
iconics.</p>

<p>You see, our subject today is Seoni the Sorceress. Here she is:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/Seoni.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2007 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I have to say this isn’t one of Wayne Reynolds’ best efforts, since the
proportions and the pose are a bit weird. That aside, Seoni stands out among the
Iconics in that she shows quite a bit of skin, tough at least her bio gives us a
reason for that. That bio is somewhat split between the page containing her
<a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/seoni.html">d20 stats</a> and this <a href="http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5la75?Meet-the-Iconics-Seoni">blog post</a>.</p>

<p>As the Iconic Sorcerer, Seoni represents a class that’s present in the
Pathfinder <em>and</em> d20 core rules, but absent from <strong>DF 1</strong>, which had the
Swashbuckler instead. It’s not hard to see why: any of the “traditional”
spellcasters from <strong>DF 1</strong> are already about as versatile as a d20 Sorcerer. It
would be a while until GURPS had an officially published template that had the
same relationship to the other spellcasters as their d20 counterparts. That
template turned out to be the aptly-named Sorcerer from <strong>Pyramid #3/82</strong>, which
in turn uses rules from <strong>GURPS Thaumathology: Sorcery</strong>.</p>

<p>So now that I’ve explained my reasoning, let’s look at what we can learn from
Seoni’s bio and stats.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>She comes from the land of Varisia, and belongs to the nomadic culture of its
original inhabitants. This culture is roughly analogous to the Romani of our
world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Due to her mystical bloodline, Seoni has experienced mysterious visions since
a very young age, and her quest to understand those has led to the awakening
of her powers. The tatoos covering most of her body are both a status symbol
in her culture and a focus for her magic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seoni’s obsession with being in control of her own fate combines with her
penchant for detailed plans to make her look like a “control freak” to her
companions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>She is <em>extremely</em> blasty. The vast majority of her abilities deal direct
damage, usually with fire or lightning. The rest are either straightforward
combat debuffs (<em>glitterdust</em>, <em>dispel magic</em>) or energy barriers (<em>mage
armor</em>, <em>shield</em>, <em>wall of force</em>).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our version of Seoni certainly manages to uphold the “less known spells cast
more frequently” motto of the d20 Sorcerer. She knows all of four spells, but
she can cast all of them all day long without even spending FP as long as she
can both move and speak when she does so. She can only use one of them at a
time, but Accelerated Casting allows her to switch effects without pausing. She
can do passably well at social endeavors with her training in Diplomacy and her
Charisma, and can improvise any minor spell with a full cost of 7 points or
less, but what she’s really good at is spamming lightning bolts all day, every
day.</p>

<p>As for power-ups, she can always use more Sorcery spells! Her mundane skills are
lacking a bit, so any spare points there also help. Those players willing to
save points for a while can fully master Dispel Magic for an additional 48
points, which would enable Seoni to cast and maintain 2 effects at once.</p>
