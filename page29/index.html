            <p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, some monster books from 3e introduced the notion of
living spells, creatures made from pure magic and patterned after one of the
commonly available spells in the game. I guess Apocalypse Spells take some
inspiration from those, but the end result is very different. The classificaion
of Apocalypse Spell is only applied to those living spells that arise from the
most metal of magics.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Every once in a great while, someone manages to cast a truly epic spell. We’re
talking the sort of thing that can slay a god, bind a primordial, instantly
destroy an empire, create an astral dominion from nothing, and so on. These
spells are so powerful the residual energy left in their wake can attain
sentience and become a construct of pure magic whose powers and personality are
modeled after the effects of their progenitor spell.</p>

<p>Despite their godlike power, apocalypse spells are simple creatures at
heart. The kind of magic that gives birth to them is usually destructive and
indiscriminate, and so are they at their cration. The passage of years allows
them to develop distinct personalities and goals. Thus they can end up allying
with other creatures who share those goals, or who manage to persuade them to
help.</p>

<p>If all else fails, there are certain rituals that allow a powerful enough caster
to assume full control of an apocalypse spell. They’re most commonly cast by the
Forsaken, a society of epic villains who get an entry further into this
book. Angels, devils and demons also frequently try to influence these living
spells.</p>

<p>The book doesn’t say it, but I would guess the population of each type of
apocalypse spell is fixed. The spells that generated them were unique, and were
only cast once. Killing one of them permanently reduces that population.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>All Apocalypse Spells are Animates with the Construct keyword, but that’s where
their similarity ends. Each stat block described here represents the progeny of
a different epic spell.</p>

<p>They do have a common signature trait, however: <strong>Unfettered Apocalypse</strong> is a
reaction that triggers when they are first bloodied or when they take a critical
hit, once per encounter. It creates a perfect duplicate of the spell that lasts
for a turn. During this turn, it has the same HP and abilities as the original,
and can act right after the original’s action. The duplicate can’t create
another duplicate itself, however, so no infinitely spawning epic monsters for
you.</p>

<h3 id="prison-of-mual-tar">Prison of Mual-Tar</h3>

<p>The primordial Mual-Tar was defeated by the gods in the Dawn War, but couldn’t
be killed. So it was bound in chains forged by Moradin himself and enchanted
with a unique binding ritual. As Mual-Tar strained against these chains, shards
of them broke off and fell into the Astral Sea, where they gained life. Prisons
of Mual-Tar are born with opposing impulses to imprison and destroy, and their
individual goals are related to one of these.</p>

<p>These apocalypse spells are Large Immortal Animates with the Construct
keyword, and Level 26 Soldiers with 242 HP. They have a ground speed of 6 and
Resist Force 15. Very few creatures have resistance to force damage!</p>

<p>The Prison is surrounded by an aura (5) of <strong>Cloying Chains</strong>, who marks all
enemies caught inside. As an <strong>Agent of Divine Will</strong>, it ignores
insubstantiality, concealment and partial cover (but not full cover or
concealment).</p>

<p>It attacks with a Reach 4 <strong>Fettering Lash</strong>, which deals physical damage. If
the target tries to make an attack that doesn’t target the Prison in its next
action, the Prison pulls it up to 10 squares to a square adjacent to itself. It
can make this attack twice per action against different targets, thanks to
<strong>Double Attack</strong>. When the Prison is subject to forced movement, it can use
<strong>Reactive Coils</strong> to pull the triggering enemy adjacent to itself.</p>

<p>The Prison’s divine origin makes it a bit reluctant to attack divine characters,
and it might be convinced to lend its aid against elementals and demons. Their
Double Attack ability makes them heavy hitters, and all the long-range pulling
they can do makes them excellent at isolating PCs from each other.</p>

<h3 id="herald-of-colorless-fire">Herald of Colorless Fire</h3>

<p>In the ancient history of the Greyhawk setting, there were two great empires who
were at war with each other, and who ended up using apocalyptic spells to erase
each other from the world. The Rain of Colorless Fire was the more spectacular
of the two, so it’s the one that gets mentioned most often in other
publications. It turned the entire territory of the empire of Suel into a desert
of ash and dust that was still a big feature of Oerth’s geography in its
narrative present.</p>

<p>Heralds of Colorless Fire arose from the ashes of that desert and began
wandering the planes. They are made from that same fire, and their innate
motivation is simple: burn everything. They are, however, smart enough to toy
with their victims and to lure powerful targets into favorable terrain.</p>

<p>Heralds are Medium Natural Animates (construct, fire) and Level 27 Skirmishers
with 244 HP. They have a Speed of 8 (fly 6), and 15 fire resistance.</p>

<p>All of their attacks deal damage of the “fire and force” combined type, meaning
you need resistance to both types to stop it. Fire or Force Resistance alone
do nothing. This is a pretty good way of modeling supernatural fire that burns
anything.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a <strong>Caress of Flame</strong>, and they can also use a <strong>Storm of
Colorless Fire</strong> (recharge 5+) that allows them attack a Close Burst 1, shift
half their speed, and repeat the attack. Each of these bursts does more damage
than the basic melee attack.</p>

<p>The Herald can use <strong>Flickering Flame</strong> to shift 4 squares as a minor action,
but this ability gets shut down for a turn if it takes cold damage. I do notice
it doesn’t have the usual 1/round limitation of minor-action movement abilities.</p>

<p>In combat, these are zippy fraggers, well-equipped for constant hit and run
tactics. They should never stay still, and should never use a move action while
Flickering Flame is active.</p>

<h3 id="shard-of-uralinda">Shard of Uralinda</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a Winter Fey named Rodielle who was a member of the
Winter Court. Rodielle tried to woo a member of the Summer Court and was
spurned. He became so angry at this that, instead of resorting to the usual fey
courtly intrigue, he did something truly terrible instead.</p>

<p>Rodielle devised a spell of ice and death, and cast it upon the eladrin city of
Uralinda, the place which his former beloved liked the most in all the
worlds. Ice shards rained upon the city and ripped it apart, killing
thousands. That part was on purpose. Then the shards were animated by the souls
of the slain and began wandering all the worlds. That part was an
accident. Whoops!</p>

<p>The tormented souls inside the shards seek the release of final death, but they
only have limited control over their icy cages. So they throw themselves at
anyone who seems like they can put up a fight, hoping to be slain and
released. Sometimes they also get controlled by spellcasters to do their
bidding, which I imagine must be even less pleasant than their baseline state.</p>

<p>Shards of Uralinda are Medium Fey Animates (construct, cold), and Level 28
Minion Soldiers. Their basic attacks deal damage of the “cold and psychic”
combined type, and despite being minions they also have the Unfettered
Apocalypse ability. In practice, this means they last for an additional turn
after you kill them.</p>

<h3 id="godslayer-inferno">Godslayer Inferno</h3>

<p>These are the product of one of the many spells wielded by the primordials
themselves during the Dawn War. It created a torrent of white and violet flames
that prevented deities from discorporating and suppressed their immortal
natures. As an unintended side effect, the flames also ended up absorbing some
of the divine essence they burned away and became imbued with the spark of
life. They remain steadfast in their original purpose of murdering the gods and
their servants.</p>

<p>From the description, it seems that this was one of the few “apocalyptic” spells
that was used repeatedly as a weapon of war, so I’d guess there’s a higher
population of Godslayer Infernos than of the other monsters in this entry. Yay?</p>

<p>Godslayer Infernos are Medium Elemental Animates (construct, fire), and Level 28
Artillery with 194 HP. They have Resist Fire 15 and a ground speed of 6.</p>

<p>Both their <strong>Fiery Claws</strong> and the <strong>Fire Bolts</strong> they shoot inflict a large
chunk of ongoing fire damage (20 aned 25, respectively) without dealing any
immediate damage. They can also use a special attack named <strong>Godsbane Inferno</strong>
(area burst 2, range 10) which does deal immediate damage as well as inflicting
more ongoing fire damage. This ongoing damage is more presistent - it’s reduced
from 15 to 10 with the first save, and only disappears after the second.</p>

<p>The inferno’s main source of immediate damage is <strong>Cloying Flames</strong>, which
causes all targets taking ongoing fire damage within 10 squares to immediately
take an amount of fire damage equal to that of ongoing damage.</p>

<p>Despite being artillery, the inferno also has good cause to stick close to the
PCs. Its Elemental Inferno aura (2) strips all enemies inside of any fire
resistance they might have and prevents them from rolling saves against ongoing
fire damage!</p>

<p>I don’t think ongoing fire damage stacks, so it’s unlikely the inferno itself
can inflict more than the 25 its fire bolts cause. But Cloying Flames makes them
pair <em>extremely</em> well with other epic fire monsters. If nothing else fits, you
could add multiple infernos in an encounter, but their danger level grows very
fast in proportion to their numbers.</p>

<h3 id="light-of-amoth">Light of Amoth</h3>

<p>We already heard of the dead god Amoth during Demogorgon’s entry. He was
responsible for splitting Demogorgon’s original head in two, just before being
himself slain by the demon. Here we learn that there’s more to this story.</p>

<p>No less than three demon princes stormed Amoth’s domain to kill him: Orcus,
Demogorgon, and Rimmon. They all fought Amoth at the same time, and while
Demogorgon did strike the final blow in the fight, it didn’t kill Amoth
immediately either. The god had time to unleash a death curse, one so powerful
it consumed his remaining life force in order to take the three demon lords
along with him in a universe-shaking explosion.</p>

<p>The three tried to get clear of the blast, but didn’t manage in time. Orcus and
Demogorgon were a little quicker on the uptake than Rimmon, so they betrayed
Rimmon first and used him as a shield to protect themselves from Amoth’s
curse. Rimmon was disintegrated, which is why we never heard of him before.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, that curse generated living spells of its own. These
crystalline giants also incorporate fragments of essence from both Amoth and
Rimmon, so they’re compelled to hunt down demonic and divine creatures in equal
measure.</p>

<p>Lights of Ammoth are Large Immortal Animates (construct), and Level 30 Brutes
with 341 HP. They’re almost gods themselves! They have a ground speed of 6, but
no special resistances.</p>

<p>They fight with their Reach 2 <strong>Fists of Wrath</strong>, which do a lot of
damage. <strong>Fury of the Dead</strong> (recharge 6+) allows them to attack every creature
in range with their fists. They can also use an ability called <strong>Legacy of
Kalandurren</strong> that targets everyone in a Close Burst 2 for cold damage equal to
that of a punch, and immobilizes them. Kalandurren was Amoth’s domain.</p>

<p>When a Light of Amoth takes damage, it releases a <strong>Wave of Retribution</strong> that
does an automatic 5 damage to everyone within 2 squares of it.</p>

<p>All of this means you <em>want</em> to let them get surrounded by the PCs.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I think these monsters are really cool! I don’t know if any more apocalypse
spells were ever published, but I really like the basic idea behind them. I
wonder if there is one for Karsus’ Avatar (FR) or the Mourning (Eberron). These
magical disasters feel like they’re about the right scale for it.</p>

<p>Mechanically, I find them fairly interesting. They’re not mind-blowing but they
display the consistently higher level of quality that would become standard from
this point on.</p>

<p>This is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Great apes are real world animals, and they’ve also been in D&amp;D pretty much
since the beginning. This MM3 entry is the first I’ve seen them in 4e, though by
this point in the edition we might have gotten stats for them in some other
non-Monster Manual publication.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The MM3 doesn’t really try to model real-world great apes. Their depiction seems
more inspired by pulp stories and the Jungle Book.</p>

<p>D&amp;D great apes are natural animals, and have inhabited the world’s jungles since
the dawn of time. Some revere them as manifestations of the primal spirits,
others enslave them as laborers and gladiators. Goblins kidnap young apes and
raise them as guardians. Other humanoids might use them as slave labor, and some
spellcasters enslave them with magic to use as bodyguards or gladiators.</p>

<p>In the wild, great apes are very territorial and fiercely defend their homes
from intruders using surprisingly sophisticated teamwork. Groups of apes are
usually led by a “silverback”, a larger and older male who fights even more
fiercely than the others to protect his family.</p>

<p>PCs might meet a group of apes when traveling through jungle terrain,
particularly mountainous jungle. Communication is likely to be difficult unless
they have a druid or another primal character with them. If they do, it might be
possible to convince the apes to stand down. If they don’t it’s a fight, though
I guess the apes in this case will be trying to drive the PCs off rather than
kill them. Apes being used as attack beasts by sapient villains will usually
fight to kill, though.</p>

<p>You also have the slightly less natural Ape Temple Guardians, who a long time
ago used to be sapient humanoids but were twisted into their current form by
some ancient curse. Now they make their homes in certain ruined temples,
compelled to guard their treasures. Unlike natural apes, temple guardians are
carnivorous. They fight to kill and will usually eat dead intruders, leaving
their bones lying around as warnings.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>All the apes depicted here are Medium Natural Beasts. They have low-light
vision, and a climb speed (whose value varies per stat block). Their signature
trait is <strong>Swift Climber</strong>, which makes them immune to opportunity attacks when
climbing. Needless to say, be sure to include plenty of climbing opportunities
in combat encounters against apes.</p>

<h3 id="great-ape">Great Ape</h3>

<p>This “basic model” is a Level 4 Skirmisher with 55 HP. It has a ground speed of
7 and a climb speed of 6. They don’t have Spider Climb, but I’d be amenable to
letting them use their climb speed to brachiate through the forest canopy.</p>

<p>Great apes fight with <strong>Slams</strong> and they can also attack <strong>On The Run</strong>, which
allows them to shift or climb half their speed and make a slam attack at any
point during the movement.</p>

<p>They can also use a <strong>Felling Blow</strong> (recharge 6+), which allows them to make
two slam attacks against the same target. If both hit, the target also falls
prone.</p>

<p>Great apes should rarely stand still when fighting - it’s On The Run all the way
with them. The exception is when they stop a bit to use Felling Blow.</p>

<h3 id="silverback-ape">Silverback Ape</h3>

<p>Silverbacks don’t run around. Their goal is to be a very visible and very
intimidating threat, drawing all the attention and allowing their non-combatant
family members to escape, and give their fellow combatants room to
maneuver. They’re larger than regular ape but still Medium, and are Level 5
Brutes with the Leader keyword. Their speed is 6 on the ground or 4 while
climbing.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Slams</strong> do heavy damage and make the target grant combat advantage for a
turn. They can sometimes <strong>Fling</strong> (recharge 6+) a creature away, dealing even
more damage than the slam, pushing them 3 squares, and knocking them prone.</p>

<p>Finally, once per encounter silverbacks can use <strong>Chest Beat</strong> as a minor
action, which gives all beast allies within 5 squares a +2 bonus to attacks for
a turn.</p>

<h3 id="ape-temple-guardian">Ape Temple Guardian</h3>

<p>Temple Guardians are Level 6 Soldiers with 75 HP, a ground speed of 7, and a
Climb Speed of 5.</p>

<p>They fight with <strong>Clubs</strong>, which deals average damage and knocks the target
prone on a hit. <strong>Swaying Strike</strong> allows them to make a club attack and shift 3
squares. And then can also <strong>Feast</strong> on a prone target, dealing light damage but
gaining 10 temporary HP.</p>

<p>Not only do these apes use weapons, they also coordinate really well. They’ll
try to surround the PCs and avoid becoming isolated from each other. If a PC
gets too close to whatever they are protecting, they’ll focus fire on that PC.</p>

<p>You can combine them with regular great ape stat blocks for a bit more
variety. Story-wise they’d all be temple guardians. They might also be under
control of a naga or another eternal guardian who was responsible for cursing
them in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Normal great apes have too much of a “pulp gorilla” vibe for me to enjoy them as
monsters. I kinda like the lore of temple guardians, though.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As I write this, I’ve just finished writing all of the articles of my <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm2-4e/">Let’s
Read series on the Monster Manual 2</a>. So now I’m going to start on the
Monster Manual 3!</p>

<p>The Monster Manual 3 is obviously the third big monster book for Dungeons &amp;
Dragons 4th Edition, and it was published in June 2010, about a year after the
MM2.</p>

<p>A lot of the stuff I’ve written on the intro to the MM2 linked above also
applies to the MM3. Monster roles remain the same, as does the gradation that
goes from Minion to Regular to Elite to Solo. The encounter design system is the
same as well.</p>

<p>Some things have changed dramatically, though! While you still have the lore
tables with skill DCs, the surrounding flavor text has gotten a lot bigger,
replacing the minimalist sentences of past books with larger paragraphs written
in a more dramatic tone. The extra space taken up by this text means we no
longer have sample encounters.</p>

<p>The stat blocks themselves also changed a lot, with monster abilities separated
and listed according to the type of action they use (passive traits, standard,
move, minor, triggered, always in that order).</p>

<p>Last but not least, the math for basic monster numbers has finally reached its
final, fully fixed form. Attacks, defenses, HP and average damage all follow the
basic formula in the legendary <a href="http://blogofholding.com/?p=512">Monster Manual 3 in a Business Card</a>
post. This updated math was also published as an errata update to the Dungeon
Master’s Guide, but the Business Card has it in even more condensed
form. Chronologically, this is the first book where you wouldn’t need to apply
any blanket fixes to monster damage.</p>

<p>If you were following my Let’s Read posts while reading the actual books, you’ll
be familiar with all of these changes from the Monster Vault, which I read in
parallel with the first MM <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>. The MV would be published in November
2010, updating the most “iconic” monsters from the first two books to the new
format and collecting some from this one as well.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault would in turn be followed by “Monster Vault: Threats to the
Nentir Vale”, the final monster book I intend to cover in my readings. But
that’s still a ways away. For now, we look to the MM3.</p>

<p>This book has monsters of all levels, but focuses a bit more on the higher
end. The index in my PDF copy is a little wonky because it lists each individual
stat block in alphabetic order, but I’ll still read them in the order in which
the larger entries appear.</p>

<p>The changes in math also mean that monsters are much less likely to have healing
powers. Leader monsters from the MM3 are much more likely to provide combat
buffs than to heal their allies.</p>

<p>Like the first Monster Manual before it, the Monster Manual 2 ends with a short
appendix containing rules for using some of the humanoids from the book as
playable characters. This one is a lot smaller than the MM’s appendix, and I
don’t think any of the races in it got much in the way of subsequent support or
more complete versions.</p>

<p>The three writeups and their notable traits are listed below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bullywugs</strong> have Swamp Walk and get Primordial as a bonus language. Their
racial power is the Rancid Air aura from their monster writeups. +2 to CON and
DEX.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Duergar</strong> are predictably similar to dwarves, but they get Deep Speech as a
bonus language and the Infernal Quills racial power. +2 to CON and WIS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Kenku</strong> get the Flock Effect and Mimicry abilities from their monster
writeups, but don’t have any bonus languages. Flock Effect is a pretty awesome
ability for a rogue. +2 to DEX and CHA.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And with this we can finally close the MM2, and move on to the next book in my
planned series. See you on the Monster Manual 3 Let’s Read!</p>

<p>I see xorns in my copy of the AD&amp;D 1st Edition monster manual, so they date from
at least that far back. This is their 4e debut, and they’re the last monster in
the book.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Xorns are earth elementals native to the Elemental Chaos, but they long ago
spread to the deep subterranean tunnels and caverns of the world. Their
three-lobed radial symmetry makes them seem quite bizarre to natives of the
world.</p>

<p>Xorns can swim through rock and earth as if it was water, and must feed on
certain rare metals and gems. They’re sapient, and will often bargain with other
people, aiding in their mining or smelting efforts in exchange for their
“food”. It seems they’re not very concerned with much beyond their own survival,
so they’ll happily ally with creatures of all dispositions, from dwarves and
galeb dhur to duergar and fire giants.</p>

<p>Xorns found in the wild are likely to be drawn to the gems and magic items
carried by PCs. The PCs might be able to negotiate with them and avoid a
fight… but some less scrupulous xorns tend to use these negotiations to help
set ambushes.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get two stat blocks here, but they’re very similar, so I’ll discuss the first
one and then note how the second one differs from it.</p>

<h3 id="xorn">Xorn</h3>

<p>The basic model is a Medium Elemental Magical Beast (Earth), and a Level 9
Skirmisher with 102 HP. Its senses include darkvision and all-around vision,
which prevents it from being flanked. It has a relatively low ground speed of 5,
and a burrow speed of 5 that’s enhanced by the <strong>Earth Glide</strong> ability. It
allows the xorn to burrow through solid rock as if it was loose earth, using its
full burrow speed at all times.</p>

<p>The xorn’s basic attack is a <strong>Claw</strong>, and <strong>Triple Strike</strong> allows it to make
three of those against different targets. If there’s only one foe in range, it
will use its <strong>Earthy Maw</strong> instead since it does about double the damage of a
claw strike.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the xorn can <strong>Submerge</strong>, partially burying itself and
gaining a +2 bonus to AC until it moves. When it’s missed by a melee attack, it
can <strong>retreat</strong>, burrowing its speed as a reaction.</p>

<p>In a fight, a xorn will jump from inside a wall or floor, submerge for the AC
bonus, and claw or bite the party’s squishies. If a missed attack doesn’t make
the creature retreat automatically, it will do so on its next turn so it can
repeat this pattern. Earth Glide makes it extremely mobile despite its poor
speed, particularly in an underground environment.</p>

<h2 id="diadmondhide-xorn">Diadmondhide Xorn</h2>

<p>This is an older or simply well-fed specimen, who lives in a place of the
Elemental Chaos where its preferred food is more plentiful. Its hide glitters
with the minerals it has ingested.</p>

<p>Diamondhide xorns are Large in size, and are Level 16 Skirmishers with 160
HP. They have all the same attacks and abilties as the basic xorn, with bigger
numbers. They also have a new attack named <strong>Undermine</strong> (recharge 5+) in which
the xorn burrows its speed and attacks a creature it passes under. This targets
Reflex, does heavy damage, and restrains the target (save ends).</p>

<h2 id="sample-encounters-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounters and Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The sample encounter is level 9, and consists of a pair of xorns in cahoots with
a troop of duergar.</p>

<p>I’m happy to see xorns here. Their weird looks make them an iconic D&amp;D monster
in my mind. A nice way to close the book.</p>
