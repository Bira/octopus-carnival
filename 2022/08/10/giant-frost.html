<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>You know the drill by now - Frost Giants appeared in the MM1 and were about to
get rewritten with new math on the Monster Vault. The MM3 brings in an
assortment of them that can complement the “basic” entries in the MV. You can
look at those basic entries <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/04/04/frost-giants.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Frost giant lore remains the same. They’re plus-sized asshole vikings who like
to live in cold regions, fight with a variety of axes, and use lots of ice
magic. Some think this behavior is in service of a greater plan laid down by
their primordial masters, but that might be reaching a bit.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Frost Giants are Large Elemental Humanoids with the Cold and Giant
keywords. Their signature trait remains <strong>Icebound Footing</strong>, which reduces any
forced movement imposed on them by 2 squares and can reduce it to 0. They can
also roll a save to avoid being knocked prone. They have Resist 15 Cold, and
their ground speed is 8 with Ice Walk, which allows them to ignore ice or
snow-based difficult terrain.</p>

<h3 id="frost-giant-berserker">Frost Giant Berserker</h3>

<p>You’d expect someone with “Berserker” in its name to be a Brute, but these are
Level 16 Skirmishers with 157 HP. The book describes them as those hot-headed
youngsters who are too undisciplined to fight like proper brutes and instead
keep running around the battlefield.</p>

<p>They fight with <strong>Freezing Greataxes</strong>, which do a mix of physical and cold
damage. They can also make a <strong>Storm Charge</strong> that doesn’t provoke opportunity
attacks from its movement and deals heavy physical damage. Once per encounter,
the berserker can use its <strong>Primordial Rage</strong> to shift its speed and make three
basic attacks along the way, each against a different target. A bit more often
(recharge 4+) they can take a <strong>Giant Stride</strong> to shift 6 squares and move
through enemy spaces while doing so.</p>

<p>These giants are perfect for running right past the party’s defenders and
harassing their squishies. For extra annoyance, stage the fight in a map full of
ice-based difficult terrain, which doesn’t affect frost giants but makes it
harder for those defenders to reposition.</p>

<h3 id="frost-giant-shield-bearer">Frost Giant Shield Bearer</h3>

<p>Shield bearers are the opposite of berserkers. They’re the hardened veterans who
get the best gear and the best training. This makes them suitable to form the
core of a raiding party, or a lord’s honor guard. They’re huscarls.</p>

<p>Shield bearers are Level 18 Soldiers with 174 HP. They’re heavily armored and,
as the name implies, are just about the only frost giants who carry
shields. They still wield axes, though.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Coordinated Attack</strong> ability gives them combat advantage against any
enemy that has another shield bearer adjacent to them, no flanking
required. Their <strong>Icy Battleaxes</strong> do cold damage and mark for a turn. Once per
encounter they can enhance an attack and turn it into a <strong>Protective Strike</strong>,
which deals 10 extra cold damage and grants 25 temporary HP to an ally within 10
squares.</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>Defensive Stand</strong> allows them spend a minor action to choose an enemy
within 10 squares. If that enemy moves within reach before the end of the shield
bearer’s next turn, the shield bearer gets a free attack against that
enemy. It’s not an opportunity attack, so it should work with shifts or other
forms of movement too.</p>

<p>They’re all set up to fight in tight formations and hold ground, which means
they go well with artillery and ranged controllers.</p>

<h3 id="frost-giant-chieftain">Frost Giant Chieftain</h3>

<p>Any frost giant community not led by a titan will likely be led by one of
these. This chieftain is a Level 20 Controller with 190 HP. He has an
<strong>Emanating Cold</strong> aura (2) that makes enemies inside grant combat advantage to
cold creatures (i.e, frost giants and any monsters that are likely to tag along
with them).</p>

<p>The chieftain fights with an <strong>Icy Greataxe</strong> that does cold damage, and can
attack at range with a <strong>Eye of the Storm</strong> spell that does immediate and
ongoing cold damage in addition to slowing the target.</p>

<p>As a minor action, the chieftan can create a Medium or Large <strong>Pillar of Ice</strong>
within ten squares. The pillar lasts for a turn and “occupies” its space,
meaning no one can move through. It blocks line of sight and slows anyone who
starts their turn next to it.</p>

<p>The chieftain can also cast a spell named <strong>Grip of Winter</strong> that creates a zone
that slows and deals cold damage to those inside. The zone lasts for the whole
encounter and the power recharges once the chieftain is first bloodied.</p>

<p>Here’s your ranged controller to go with the shield bearers. Chieftains should
stay behind a line of their bodyguards, making the already difficult terrain of
the icy battlefield even worse with ice pillars and slowing attacks. Then you
release the berserkers to step over all that and hit the PC’s back ranks.</p>

<h3 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h3>

<p>I like giants in general, so I like these MM3 giant entries even though they
don’t include much new lore. The trio presented here has nice mechanical synergy
and should also be fun to use with the frost giants from the MV.</p>
