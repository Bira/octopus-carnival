<p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>I believe quasits have been around since AD&amp;D 1st Edition, and they’ve
re-appeared in every edition since. This is where they enter 4e.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Back when they first appeared, quasits were simply the demon equivalent of
Imps: tiny, winged, and tricksy. The only reason they were a different creature
at all is was because of the game’s insistence that demons and devils are
completely different creature types.</p>

<p>In Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fourth Edition, quasits are… the demon equivalent of
<a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/11/30/imp.html">Imps</a>. Still tiny, still tricksy, they’re extremely easy to summon as
familiars and live to tempt their masters into committing ever more horrible
acts of destruction. When one of these masters die, the quasit captures their
soul and takes it to its <em>true</em> master, usually a demon lord. Demons don’t need
souls, but I guess they’re tasty.</p>

<p>Quasits are usually encountered with whatever dupes they’ve managed to tempt
this time or with other, bigger, demons. Minions might include people of any
sapient species, with or without a spellcaster. They also like
arcanians. Quasits tend to remain invisible for as long as possible and let the
others do most of the work for them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Quasits are Tiny Elemental Humanoids with the Demon tag. They’re a bit stronger
than imps by default, being Level 7 Controllers with 75 HP. They have darkvision
and a fantastic ground speed of 8, though they’re not winged and can’t fly in
this edition.</p>

<p>They’re unusual among demons in that most of their attacks have a trickery and
temptation theme, to an even greater extend than an imp. This starts with their
<strong>Tempter’s Influence</strong> aura (2), which inflicts a -2 penalty to saves on
enemies caught inside. They can also become <strong>Invisible</strong> at will with a minor
action (1/round), and stay in this state until they make an attack roll.</p>

<p>Their basic attack is a Reach 0 venomous <strong>bite</strong>, which does physical damage
and forces the target to grant combat advantage (save ends). Reach 0 means they
need to enter the target’s square, which they can do because they’re Tiny.</p>

<p>Their other attack is <strong>Evil Temptation</strong>, a mind-affecting spell that targets
Will and affects enemies in a Close Blast 3. This is another at-will minor
action (1/round), and though it does no damage it dazes (save ends). The
“temptation” here is that victims can choose to end the effect early by making
an attack against one of their allies!</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>So I guess quasits aren’t just demonic imps in 4e. They’re also doing some of
the succubus’ job now that she left to become a devil. PCs affected by Evil
Temptation are likely to try to shrug it off with saves at first, but if they
have a streak of unlucky rolls that friendly fire incident is going to start
feeling mighty attractive. Daze is such a serious condition after all…</p>

<p>It’s a genuine temptation mechanic! I think I only saw one other instance of
this, for the MM2’s <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/07/11/devils-02.html">Misfortune Devils</a>. Not even succubi themselves have
temptation mechanics, since their powers and “lore baggage” end up making them
better for <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/12/15/succubus.html">making PCs run away</a>. This is an at-will Blast attack, so you’ll
likely have <em>multiple</em> PCs affected by the power at any one time.</p>

<p>Quasits should fight by alternating Evil Temptation and Invisibility, and should
hang around close to “tempted” PCs while invisible to make their saves
harder. While this is happening, the quasit’s larger allies are going to have a
field day with all those dazed heroes. Brutes and artillery work well here.</p>

<p>PC tactics when fighting a group containing a quasit are very clear: crush it
<em>as soon as possible</em>. Have your party’s scouts use their high Perception to
find the invisible little bugger and smite him with close or area attacks.</p>
