<p>At this point in the campaign our PCs had <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/03/22/brutal-advent-part-3.html">completed their first assignment</a>
and brought home <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/03/30/x-com-arsenal-of-ruin.html">a ton of alien doodads</a>, though they didn’t know much about
them yet. It was time to do something about that last part, and this post will
both tell you how they did it and give you a peek behind the curtain of my
research system.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-science">The Power of Science!</h2>

<p>Research was always one of my favorite parts of any X-COM game, especially in
that first playthrough where the tech tree is still a mistery. I wanted to bring
the same sense of mistery and discovery to this campaign, while keeping
bookkeeping to a minimum. This meant I needed an intriguing tech tree, and a
simple way to walk it.</p>

<p>The composition of the tech tree was the easiest part: as it turns out,
the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/152691/The-Dreams-of-Ruin">Dreams of Ruin</a> book already has a perfectly usable and quite
comprehensive tree! I would need some conversion work before I could use it, but
the general shape of the thing was already good.</p>

<p>The main conversion work lay in deciding how my version of X-COM could perform
this research. The detailed descriptions in the original material are geared
towards a D&amp;D fantasy setting: a place with medieval technology but rich in
magic where the greatest challenge lies in building scientific instruments
precise enough to study the Dreams, each of which is a unique major artifact in
its own right.</p>

<p>The research challenges faced by X-COM were the exact opposite of the scenario
above: its scientists have an abundance of mass-produced high-precision
instruments, but must discover magic from first principles over the course of
the campaign in order to truly understand the threat they face. This means I
would need to insert a few extra items on the research tree related to
that. As pretty much all the alien technology involves some form of magic,
discovering its principles is a very high priority strategic goal - the rest of
the research will be severely limited until that happens.</p>

<p>Another important consideration was to figure out the pace of research. This is
determined by your basic infrastructure, which in the original material is
expressed in fantasy terms (“a single wealthy kingdom”, “all the world’s
kingdoms”, “the combined might of the Nine Hells”). Each level gives you a
shorter interval between possible breakthroughs, which is important because the
spread of the Dreams becomes irreversible 13 years after the first trees
appear. I had to decide how the X-COM project measured up in that scale.</p>

<h2 id="the-noises-in-the-dark-research-system">The Noises in the Dark Research System</h2>

<p>At the end of each field op, I would present the <em>players</em> with a
list of research topics, drawn from the loot their PCs brought from this and
previous missions, and from previous research or other story developments. Each
topic would have a cost in <em>Research Points</em>, of which they would have an amount
corresponding to X-COM’s research budget. This budget, in turn, would depend on
how happy with the organization the Council nations were, just like in the
computer games.</p>

<p>Paying for a technology in full meant it gets researched and yields it fruits
before the next mission comes up. If they could only pay part of a topic’s cost,
those points would remain “banked” until after the next mission.</p>

<p>Each of these “research phases” should represent the effort spent in one
research interval, though this part didn’t end up mattering a lot in play as I
never really tracked how much time passed between missions. I believe I settled
internally on 1-month intervals in my head, though if we were doing this
according to the <strong>Dreams of Ruin</strong> rules it should be three months for a
starting X-COM (“intermediary” infrastructure).</p>

<p>The list after their first operation consisted of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advanced Medkits</li>
  <li>Personal-Scale Combat Drones</li>
  <li>Bakegumo Corpse</li>
  <li>Puppet Corpse</li>
  <li>Alien Guns</li>
  <li>Alien Swords</li>
  <li>Alien Explosives (from mines and such)</li>
  <li>Black Tree Fragments</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two items were the technologies they would have started with had they
picked Vahlen or Shen as leads, respectively. The rest was from alien loot.</p>

<p>All of the items cost a single point, but they also had a single point to spend
at the start. After some discussion, the players ended up voting for the Black
Tree Fragments: the trees had <em>really</em> impressed them!</p>

<p>Strategically speaking, this was a good decision, since the Trees of Woe are one
of the fundamental research topics in the original material. However, the fact
that their destroyed the trees in the first mission using extreme amounts of
explosive meant R&amp;D only had a limited amount of material to work with, so I
decided this topic alone wouldn’t give them the full information on the
trees. It did give them a bit of data in their structure (“more like a fungus
than a plant, traces of metal mixed in”), as well as giving them the goal of
bringing in a proper tree sample. It also led to the researchers noticing the
fragments and most alien artifacts had this weird red dust in all of their nooks
and crannies, so the dust became a topic available for the next phase of
research.</p>

<p>Soklov’s game benefit also came in handy here, as he also gave the group a more
complete picture of what he termed the “Hostage Effect”, which is what the
original material calls <em>psychic numbness</em>. No means to counter it yet, but now
they know it exists and what it does.</p>

<p>This sort of decision is still something that causes me some worry, to be
honest. Was I giving my players a good enough benefit for their choice? This was
a PbP game, remember, so each mission took literally months to resolve. Research
phases would be few and far between, and I didn’t want to give the group the
impression they weren’t making progress. Here, opening up a new goal seems to
have satisfied them, but in retrospect I should probably have given them the Red
Dust information for free in addition to the other things. Knowing about the
spores early on would likely have changed their perception of things quite
significantly, and it’s something they never ended up voting for on their
own.</p>

<p>Despite being smaller than cyclopes, ogres are actually more dangerous! A
cyclops is a slow, stupid, and indecisive combatant that may be driven away by
an insistent enough attack. None of that applies to ogres! While not really
<em>bright</em>, they are very cunning and driven to satisfy their endless
hunger. Ogres tend to live in caves and ruins, and their smaller size means they
don’t require those ruins to be exceptionally spacious. They love to eat fresh
meat, especially that of humans, and will attack any they perceive. While
typically solitary, sometimes people do run into a pair of them.</p>

<p>In combat, ogres will make use of their great strength to strike enemies, but
what they really like to do is grab a foe and <em>twist</em>. Faced with a large group,
they will often grab a single for and try to drag them away, but it doesn’t take
much to make an ogre go berserk. A berserk ogre fights to the death, but even
then it has enough presence of mind to fight smart, targetting its
weaker-looking foes and trying to get the others in a position where they can’t
dodge effectively.</p>

<p>Ogres don’t typically carry weapons, but will gladly use any available objects
as improvised clubs or projectiles.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/04/03/psi-wars-golko.html">Psi Wars: Golko the Slaver</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The name of the Psi Wars game I’m starting over on RPG.net is “Golko Wants You
Dead”. That is also its premise: there’s a crime lord named Golko, he wants the
PCs dead, and they need to do something about it. During character creation,
each player gets to decide why Golko wants their PC dead, and to state a true
thing about Golko himself. I love this, because I love using player input in
this way. I did something similar with my <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/gurps-xcom-reports/">2015-2016 X-COM campaign</a>.</p>

<p>I can’t claim credit for the “Golko Wants You Dead” premise, however - I first
saw it used a number of years ago in a Wushu game, also on the RPG.net
forum. I’m just recycling it here, and in fact I already got a <a href="https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?800200-GURPS-Psi-Wars-Golko-Wants-You-Dead!&amp;p=20951813#post20951813">nice nostalgic
compliment</a> from a player in that original game!</p>

<p>I already posted <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/03/20/psi-wars-golko.html">a brief summary of who our PCs are</a>, and I promised to post
about Golko too. Now it’s time to deliver. Each Golko Wants You Dead game ends
up with a different Golko, and this one is ours. The description below
synthesizes all the True Things my players said about him, plus a few things of
my own invention.</p>

<h2 id="golko-the-slaver">Golko the Slaver</h2>

<figure>

     Golko the Slaver. Illustration by raylotic on DeviantArt.
    </a>
</figure>

<p>Golko cuts a large and imposing figure: his body plan is basically centauroid,
though the first word that comes to mind when looking at him is “lobster” rather
than “horse”. He has six articulated legs and four arms: a pair of hugely strong
and sharp crab-like pincers, and a smaller, weaker pair of hand-like
manipulators. He’s a callous and cruel individual who views anyone but himself
as assets or liabilities to be dealt with accordingly.</p>

<p>His species is native to the planet Geryon, which lies outside Empire
space. Psionic ability is extremely common among them, and while this gave rise
to a rich psionic tradition it also caused some conflict in their otherwise
peaceful society. A minority of Geryonites are born without psionic potential,
and they tend to be seen as embarrassments to their families. Golko was one such
individual. He left his planet out of spite, and found a profitable niche
renting slaves to the Empire.</p>

<p>You see, Imperial law forbids its citizens from owning slaves, but its elites
exploit a loophole that allows slave-owning aliens based outside the Empire’s
borders to “rent” these slaves to Imperial citizens. Golko is a very big player
in this market, having clawed his way to the top both literally and
figuratively. He sells human and alien slaves to rich nobles and businessmen,
bloodsport arenas, and to whoever else wants to buy any. He also keeps a portion
of them for himself, particularly those who display psionic abilities. Golko is
funding a secret lab whose scientists experiment on these psions in hopes of
finding a way to awaken his own psionic abilities.</p>

<p>The PCs have recently dealt blows to all of these operations, either by
disrupting his slave shipments or by escaping slavery themselves. Golko’s
current obsession is making an example out of all of them, so that business as
usual can resume.</p>

<p>Golko’s organization is composed of criminals belonging to several more common
species, like humans and other humanoid aliens. Many of them use Imperial gear
that comes to Golko through the same routes through which he sells his
slaves. He also has a sizable force of brand new combat droids acquired through
the same channels.</p>

<h2 id="design-notes">Design Notes</h2>

<p>The details of Golko’s business operations and his psionics obsession were all
given to me by the players, as was the fact that he could be described as a
“creature”, which meant he’s an alien.</p>

<p>Now, an alien slaver inevitably draws comparisons to Jabba the Hutt, who fills
this role in Star Wars. I wanted my Golko to be both reminiscent of Jabba while
also being different from him. So you have a large, non-humanoid alien crime
lord who <em>isn’t</em> an immobile mound of quivering flesh, and is instead a
formidable threat all by himself. All of this is known to the PCs, which is why
I’m posting it as part of the blog. Further campaign developments will be posted
as they appear in actual play!</p>

<p>Geryon, the name of his native planet, is also the name of a mythological giant
defeated by Hercules in one of his twelve labors: he had three heads and six
arms. Golko has a different collection of surplus appendages, but I still felt
the name was appropriate.</p>

<p>As I mentioned back in the post about my <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2017/02/08/x-com-setup.html">campaign setup</a> on this game, I
can’t post adaptations of the Dreams of Ruin creatures here without violating
the book’s license. What I <em>can</em> do, however, is post stats for their gear in
this campaign, since it’s different from what’s in the original book. Today,
we’ll focus on the Puppets of Ruin, which are the only alien the group met in
their first operation that actually uses gear.</p>

<p>Original-flavor Puppets of Ruin carry magic swords, bolt-action rifles,
concussion hand grenades, and ocasionally a RPG launcher. That’s a terrifying
loadout for anyone in the medieval fantasy worlds they’re meant to attack! With
this equipment, and at 3 Hit Dice, they’re supposed to be superior to any
conventional force of 1 HD soldiers or even 2 HD humanoids. That would be even
truer in a GURPS campaign, where they’re taking TL 7 weapons into a TL 3
world. Even powerful adventurers wouldn’t be able to face them head-on!</p>

<p>However, in <em>this</em> campaign they’re attacking a late TL8 world, which means
their original equipment would actually be <em>less advanced</em> than what’s typically
available to an outfit like X-COM! That feels wrong to me - it’s not a proper
X-COM game unless even the “weakest” alien has a technological edge over your
soldiers. Therefore, I decided they needed an upgrade. And now, for the first
time, I’m publishing stats for their weapons:</p>

<h2 id="puppet-gear">Puppet Gear</h2>

<p>These weapons and their corresponding ammunition are <em>grown</em> by the Body Trees
rather than manufactured. Their construction and functionality is equivalent to
Tech Level 9. They tend to have a curvy, organic look, with no unecessary
seams. Each individual item is slightly different from all others, though
ammunition for a specific weapon will always fit another weapon of the same
type.</p>

<p>Weapon stats are all as described in the <strong>Basic Set</strong>, with two exceptions.
Weight is in <em>kilograms</em>, not pounds, because I like the metric system more; and
monetary cost is not listed, because I didn’t use it in the campaign
itself. Filling a cost in shouldn’t be too hard for those GMs that want it, and
to figure out an item’s weight in pounds just multiply the listed numbers by 2.</p>

<p>These days, I prefer to use the alternate Guns specialties presented in
<strong>Pyramid #3/65: Alternate GURPS III</strong>. I did so in the campaign itself, and I
do so in this article, though I also note what <strong>Basic Set</strong> skills the weapons
require.</p>

<h3 id="puppet-sword">Puppet Sword</h3>

<p>Around 1 meter long, this sword has a straight double-edged blade made of a
ceramic/metal composite material and a substantial handguard similar to that of
a cavalry saber. As puppets are more proficient in melee combat than just about
any typical modern soldier, this is probably their most dangerous weapon if they
happen to be within easy reach of their targets.</p>

<p>Treat this as a Superfine (p. UT163) backsword (p. MA227 or LT66). It’s used
with the Broadsword skill. All puppets have one.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="puppet-rifle">Puppet Rifle</h3>

<p>This is a short, semi-automatic carbine firing caseless 7.77mm rounds with an
Electrothermal-Chemical (ETC) action. It contains no targetting electronics, but
the puppets’ own senses and link with the forest more than compensate for
this. It’s made from the same materials as the sword and self-cleaning,
requiring no regular maintenance. It’s extremely reliable and won’t malfunction
unless some external factor lowers its Malf.</p>

<p>The Puppet Rifle is fired with Guns (Longarm), or Guns (Rifle) if using the
Basic Set skills. All puppets have a fully loaded rifle plus 3 or 4 extra
magazines. The Trees of Woe bear extra reloads as fruit, so they can resupply if
they have access to a thicket.</p>

<h3 id="puppet-grenade">Puppet Grenade</h3>

<p>This is a concussion grenade with an advanced plastic explosive filling and a
soft outer shell that limits fragmentation. It’s used with Throwing, and every
puppet carries from 1 to 3. These also grow from the Trees of Woe, so puppets
near a thicket will be profiligate in their use.</p>

<p>The Puppet Grenade is essentially a TL 9 HEC hand grenade (p. UT146 and UT154).</p>

<h3 id="puppet-rpg">Puppet RPG</h3>

<p>This weapon is a thin launch tube with handles and iron sights, firing a 77mm
over-caliber warhead which vaguely resembles a RPG-7 round. It takes 3 seconds
to set up. While launchers and their ammo are also provided by the forest, they
appear at a slower rate, and only where the Trees of Woe are at their
densest. Only about 1 in 7 puppets has a launcher, and will typically carry from
1 to 3 rounds for it. Its squad mates might carry extra rounds as well.</p>

<p>The launcher has a hazardous backblast that causes 2d burning damage. It uses
Guns (LAW), which has the same name in both skill systems.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-arsenal-of-ruin">Using the Arsenal of Ruin</h2>

<p>These weapons have other campaign roles aside from equipping the Puppets of
Ruin! They occupy the same niche as lasers in the original X-COM or magnetic
weapons in the 2015 XCOM 2, using technology that’s a step up from what’s
initially available to human soldiers but not as good as what the alien
masterminds have at their disposal.</p>

<p>Unlike the alien weapons from the X-COM computer games, they can be easily
operated by humans and contain no biometric locks, self-destruct failsafes or
anything of the sort. Someone who came across one of them lying on the floor
could just pick it up and use it, assuming they had the appropriate
skills.</p>

<p>This is by design! The Forest <em>wants</em> people to commit violence within its
borders, and is only too happy to provide them with the tools to do so. Any
local Servants of Ruin drawn to its borders will soon find themselves
well-supplied with these weapons, and possibly in command of a puppet
posse. Even people who aren’t quite as evil might be gifted with weapons as a
temptation. They are also chock-full of spores, so taking them beyond the
forest’s borders aids the spread of the Dreams.</p>

<p>A chimera is nightmarish three-headed beast whose appearance in Gransys heralds
the coming of the Dragon. It resembles a huge lion with a giant goat’s head
growing out of its back and a monstrous snake in place of its tail. All three
heads are extremely dangerous! Both the lion and the snake have very strong
bites and have large enough jaws to grapple human-sized targets, with the snake
being venomous as well. And while the goat doesn’t have a large range of motion,
it can <em>cast spells</em>. This last fact is very often the last surprise any who
dare face the chimera have in their lives, and is a sign that the monster is a
lot more intelligent than its animalistic appearance would indicate. In addition
to all of this, all three heads can act independently at the same time.</p>

<p>As heralds to the Dragon, chimerae guard the path to it, making their lairs in
places one must cross to arrive at the Dragon’s chosen nest. They can also
sometimes be found near lesser dragons as well.</p>

<p>GMs who use chimerae in their games are also encouraged to
include <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/24/snake-maned-lion.html">Snake-Maned Lions</a> as either a variant chimera or a related
monster. You can never have too many freakish mutant lions in your game!</p>

<h2 id="fighting-the-chimera">Fighting the Chimera</h2>

<p>Chimerae like to incapacitate targets either by grappling them with one of their
biting heads, or by magically dazing them or putting them to sleep. They will
then proceed to tear the helpless victim apart with their teeth and
claws. Despite its size, the monster is fairly mobile and smart enough to try
and avoid being surrounded. It’s most vulnerable to long-ranged attacks, but
it’s also smart enough to be aware of this! When faced with a large group of
opponents, a chimera might try to drag them away one at a time.</p>

<p>A chimera’s lion and goat heads can be incapacitaded by a single attack doing
over 12 HP of injury (as if they were limbs). They each have all the hit
locations you’d expect of a head: neck, face, eyes, brain. These can be targeted
at the usual penalties. Killing a head prevents the chimera from performing the
actions associated with that head. The lion head is the beast’s main head - it
dies when the whole creature dies.</p>

<h2 id="chimera-variants">Chimera Variants:</h2>

<p>The same variants described in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/24/snake-maned-lion.html">Snake-Maned Lion</a> article are appropriate
here, with the exception of <em>Intelligent</em> (which already applies to all
chimerae).  <em>Gorechimerae</em> are not only both <em>Armored</em> and <em>Demonic</em>, they also
know more spells and have higher combat skills! No one has seen one of these in
Gransys - the laws of nature would need to be completly broken for such a beast
to cross the Rift.</p>
