<p>The first of the Bs! The Balhannoth is a Large Aberrant Magical Beast
(blind). “Blind” here is a keyword with some rules attached: blind creatures
cannot be blinded (obviously!) and are immune to gaze attacks and other effects
that rely on sight. They rely on special senses such as blindsight or
tremorsense, but can’t make Perception checks beyond the range of these
senses. I’d interpret that to mean they can’t make <em>visual</em> Perception checks.</p>

<p>A level 13 elite lurker, the Balhannoth has a slug-like body that menaces with
spikes, five clawed tentacles, and a huge eyeless maw for a face. I’m told they
first appeared in the Monster Manual IV for 3.5, but this is my first personal
contact with them. They’re only on the Monster Manual and have no Vault version.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>There isn’t much here. Balhannoths are indiscriminate ambush predators who live
in the Underdark. Barely sapient at Int 3, they understand Deep Speech and are
Chaotic Evil. Balhannoths might tail their chosen prey for hours, waiting for
the best moment to strike.</p>

<p>The evil worm-things rarely associate with others of their own species (except
perhaps to reproduce), but sometimes they can be trained to obey commands by
other sapients. Telepathic creatures have an easier time of it and can “tame”
captured adults. Non-telepathic trainers must train a balhannoth from birth if
they are to have any hope of success.</p>

<p>In short, they’re pretty much tailor-made mind flayer pets, and would likely be
used like guard dogs and advance forces during a raid. The flayers get the
brains, the balhannoths get the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>Being blind, balhannoths are immune to gaze attacks and illusions and have
Blindsight 10 from ESP. They’re relatively slow at Speed 4, but with spider
climb they can pretty much move in three dimensions inside the Underdark. Their
main mode of movement, though, is the Reality Shift, a type of teleportation
that twists the surrounding space and has a 10 square range.</p>

<p>When balhannoths teleport, anyone standing next to them at the point of
departure is dazed, and anyone next to them at the point of arrival grants
combat advantage for a turn. They attack with tentacles, and can whip those
tentacles around to hit everyone on a Close Burst 3 around them and slide anyone
their hit freely within this area of effect. They also do increased damage
against targets granting CA and can become invisible at will.</p>

<p>So yeah, this is how they hunt. They’ll sense you through walls using
blindsense, teleport to the middle of the party while invisible, and use
Tentacle Whip to hurt everyone and ruin your marching order. Then they’ll
teleport away and do it again.</p>

<p>The suggested encounters are level 13: 1 balhannoth and 3 grimlock berserkers,
or 1 balhannoth and four kuo-toa. The first are likely all servants of a mind
flayer, the others had to train their pet ninja slug the hard way.</p>

<h2 id="final-impression">Final Impression</h2>

<p>There’s not much there lore-wise, but I found the mechanics pretty cool. The
concept of a teleporting ninja slug has a certain something to it. Level them up
to 17 and they’d make good aboleth pets too.</p>

<p>To close out the As, we have another classic, the Azer. I remember them from D&amp;D
3.5 as basically dwarves that are on fire. Here we get a tiny bit more
background tying them to the Fourth edition cosmology.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Way back at the dawn of time, dwarves were all slaves to the giants. Eventually
they rebelled against their masters and escaped into the world, where they would
proceed to build their own civilization. Well, most of them did.</p>

<p>Those that stayed behind were mutated by fire giants and transformed into
azer. Some of those broke free later, but some remain enslaved as laborers and
guards. So if you’re raiding the castle of the fire giant king, you’re going to
run into troops of azer before you start seeing giants. They’re Unaligned and
about as intelligent as regular dwarves, so you might be able to negotiate with
them and foment rebellion.</p>

<p>Azer don’t have a Monster Vault counterpart.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>As inhabitants of the Elemental Chaos, 4e Azer are paragon-tier opponents. We
get several stat blocks for them here. The signature Azer traits are Resist Fire
30 and Warding Flame: each enemy that starts their turn adjacent to 2 or more
azer takes 5 fire damage. They are <em>not</em> particularly vulnerable to cold.</p>

<p>The <strong>Azer Warrior</strong> is a Level 17 Minion, useful for padding out encounters
involving fire giants or azer regulars. They attack with warhammers that do fire
damage and a tiny bit of ongoing fire damage.</p>

<p>The <strong>Azer Foot Soldier</strong> is a regular version of the warrior, a Level 14
Soldier with 141 HP. his equipment and attack (singular) are pretty much
identical to the Warrior’s, aside from having normal rolled damage for their
level.</p>

<p>The <strong>Azer Rager</strong> is a totally metal Level 15 Brute who has 181 HP. She attacks
with gauntlets that menace with spikes of fire (and cause ongoing fire
damage). When bloodied, she can call upon Chains of Flame, which cause fire
damage in a Close Burst 5 around her and immobilize enemies who were already on
fire from other attacks.</p>

<p>The <strong>Azer Taskmaster</strong> is a Level 17 Controller (Leader) attacks with a scourge
that menaces with spikes of fire (and does a mix of physical and fire
damage). Once per turn it can cause a nearby enemy who just took fire damage
from any source to also take ongoing fire damage. This guy is probably an
exception to the negotiation bit - he likely gets special privileges in exchange
for keeping the other azer in line.</p>

<p>The <strong>Azer Beastlord</strong> is a Level 17 Soldier (Leader) or, in other words, a
hellhound wrangler. His basic attack is a battleaxe that mixes physical and fire
damage, and marks on a hit. The real attraction here are his other powers,
though. He can make an allied elemental beast recharge one of its encounter or
daily powers as an <em>at-will</em> minor action, and once per encounter he can hand
out a free attack to every allied elemental beast who can see him and is
flanking an enemy.</p>

<p>The suggested encounters are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Level 14: One pair of azer footsoldiers and one pair of salamanders. These
poor sods escaped the fire giants only to be enslaved by salamanders.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 15: 6 warriors, 2 ragers, and one immolith demon. <em>These</em> poor sods have
it even worse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Level 17: One taskmaster, one beastlord, 8 warriors and 1 firebred
hellhound. These could be free azer! You should totally swap the warriors for
another 2 hellhounds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Dwarves on fire! The foot soldier is a bag of HP with a single melee attack, so
it’s quite boring on its own. The others are a bit more interesting, though I
feel like the taskmaster should have a ranged attack of some sort. In fact, the
azer lineup in this book is very lacking in ranged firepower, so they need some
external artillery support. They also suffer from the classic “fire monster in a
fire dungeon” problem, where any smart party will prepare themselves to resist
much of their damage.</p>

<p>The most fun of the lot is definitely the Beastlord, particularly when
associated with a pack of hellhounds or even other, <em>non-fire</em> elemental
beasts.</p>

<p>If your previous exposure to Azer was the low-level stat block in the 3.x
monster manual, seeing them as mid-to-late paragon tier creatures might be a bit
jarring. Their abilities are simple enough that you could comfortably reduce
their level by 10 or so to make them appropriate for heroic tier games without
changing what they do in combat.</p>

<p>Like Angels, Archons in 4e are significantly different from the monsters bearing
the same name in earlier editions. In most of those they used to be Lawful Good
angels, but here they are elemental creatures who made up the bulk of the
Primordial armies during their war with the gods.</p>

<p>Back at the start of the Dawn War, the Primordials primarily used giants and
titanic elemental beasts against the gods. These were powerful but few in
number, and so effectiveness against the countless angels and exarchs of the
divine host was limited. Eventually the Primordials would learn to forge archons
from “raw” elementals, putting both sides on a more even footing.</p>

<p>Archons are militaristic and well-versed in tactics despite being Chaotic Evil,
which can easily be explained by two important traits of 4e’s alignment system:
1) “chaos” here means <em>ruin</em> instead of <em>randomness</em> and 2) Chaotic Evil is the
alignment of Team Primordial, and these beings are definitely still on Team
Primordial. These days they can be found serving as muscle for a variety of
similarly-disposed elemental beings, or protecting sites of importance to the
imprisoned primordials.</p>

<p>Like Angels, Archons are paragon-tier monsters. The Monster Manual presents fire
and ice archons, but also says there are a bunch of other types. Earth and Air
are obvious, but you also have more “exotic” types like Slime, Storm, and
Crystal. A typical archon force is composed of a jumble of different archon
types, though without strong leadership they’re prone to infighting.</p>

<p>The Monster Vault text further stresses their leadership skill and tactical
prowess, and pictures them as less prone to infighting than what the Monster
Manual said. It contains four Archon stat blocks: Earth, Fire, Water and Ice.</p>

<p>Archons generally look like humanoids sculpted out of their element, wearing
fancy (and spiky) military gear.</p>

<h2 id="fire-archons">Fire Archons</h2>

<p>Fire Archons are quite fast at Speed 8, are immune to disease and poison, and
have Resist 30 Fire. That last bit means you can theoretically pull a Dark
Schneider on them and prove your awesomeness by killing them with fire. Also of
note is the fact that none of them are particularly vulnerable to cold.</p>

<h3 id="fire-archon-emberguard">Fire Archon Emberguard</h3>

<p>This dude is a Level 12 Brute clad in plate and wielding a greataxe. They have
151 HP and somewhat subpar non-armor defenses. They have an aura that causes
fire damage to anyone adjacent to them. Their attacks appear to suffer from some
editorial issues, as they’re even less accurate they than should be by the early
monster math. In any case, they have a basic axe strike that does a combination
of physical and fire damage with the High Crit property, and a Recharge 3-6
version that also causes ongoing fire damage.</p>

<p>I addition to fixing their accuracy and damage, I’d suggest just adding the
ongoing fire damage to their basic melee attack.</p>

<h3 id="fire-archon-blazesteel">Fire Archon Blazesteel</h3>

<p>These Level 19 Soldiers are the shock troopers of the primordial armies, and can
also be found working for efreets and fire titans. They have 182 HP, and their
Will is substantially weaker than their other defenses. Blazesteels (weird name)
fight with flaming scimitars that deal physical and fire damage and mark enemies
they hit. They don’t have any powers that exploit the mark, but they do get to
make two attacks and deal extra fire damage against enemies that grant them
combat advantage. This means they do well in a team that includes skirmishers
who are good at flanking.</p>

<p>Oh, and they blow up once bloodied and once again when dead, catching everyone
in a Close Burst 2 in the ensuing conflagration and dealing ongoing fire damage.</p>

<h3 id="fire-archon-ash-disciple">Fire Archon Ash Disciple</h3>

<p>The ash disciple is a Level 20 Artillery archon, who is a bit odd in that all
its ranged attacks are encounter powers. There’s a Rain of Fire that deals
ongoing damage (or half damage on a miss); a Flame Wave that pushes and deals 10
ongoing fire damage; and a Cinder Burst that blinds. It’s only at-will ability
is a funky teleport that makes it appear out of a nearby fire creature (like
another fire archon).</p>

<p>Once its encounter powers are gone, the ash disciple will have to join the
melee with its weak fists, and be content in the knowledge that it will blow up
when it dies with an explosion similar to its Cinder Burst. This will happen
fairly fast, because as an artillery monster the flame disciple has only 150 HP.</p>

<p>I’d strongly consider adding an at-will single-target ranged attack to this
monster.</p>

<h3 id="monster-vault-fire-archon">Monster Vault Fire Archon</h3>

<p>Being the sole fire archon in the Monster Vault, it doesn’t have a fancy
name. It’s a level 13 skirmisher with 130HP and only Resist 20 fire, which leads
me to think we can lower the resistance of the MM archons to that level. Also
unlike the MM archons, this one <em>is</em> vulnerable to cold: taking cold damage
prevents it from shifting for a turn.</p>

<p>It attacks with a scimitar that does fire damage, can shift up to half its speed
as a move action, and has a Blaze Step encounter power where it shifts its whole
speed and leaves a trail of fire on the ground. This trail deals 10 fire damage
to whoever crosses it and lasts until the end of the fight.</p>

<p>I like this one. A simple monster that feels fiery and skirmisher-y.</p>

<h2 id="ice-archons">Ice Archons</h2>

<p>Like fire archons, but with ice. Speed 6 with ice walk, immune to disease and
poison, and with Resist 30 to cold.</p>

<h3 id="ice-archon-hailscourge">Ice Archon Hailscourge</h3>

<p>A plate-clad icy ninja who hops around throwing ice shuriken. Level 16
artillery. It can throw two of those shuriken on its turn, or it can conjure a
Recharge 5-6 hailstorm that has a variable area burst radius and does half
damage on a miss. If a PC tries to tag it with a ranged, close, or area attack
it can summon an ice shield once per encounter that will negate 20 damage from
that attack.</p>

<p>Simple but interesting. The only thing preventing it from being cool are the
usual math issues and the archon-specific editing problems. Be sure to correct
for those if you want to use it.</p>

<h3 id="ice-archon-rimehammer">Ice Archon Rimehammer</h3>

<p>A level 19 Soldier who fights like a Brute. His huge ice maul slows on a hit,
and deals extra damage to slowed targets. Its most soldierly trait is an aura
that freees the ground around it and makes it difficult terrain to enemies.</p>

<p>I feel the rimehammer would work best as a brute, since its arsenal is pretty
similar to that of the Aboleth Lasher, who is a brute. In fact I’d say the
rimehammer is <em>less</em> dangerous than the lasher, despite being 2 levels higher.</p>

<h3 id="ice-archon-frostshaper">Ice Archon Frostshaper</h3>

<p>Like Elsa, but evil. A Level 20 Controller (Leader), it has a large aura that
gives Regeneration 10 to any cold creature inside and turns the ground into
difficult terrain for enemies. Its basic melee attack is an ice blade that does
cold damage, and it throws ice javelins that slow for a turn. It also has an Icy
Burst area attack that slows on a hit but still does half damage on a hit, and
recharges whenever the frostshaper hits with a melee attack.</p>

<p>This suggests its strategy should be to mostly fight in melee and use bursts to
interfere with more distant fighting.</p>

<h3 id="monster-vault-ice-archon">Monster Vault Ice Archon</h3>

<p>This level 13 soldier has 135 HP, a cold resistance of only 20, and takes a -2
penalty to all defenses for a turn when hit with fire damage. It attacks with an
mace that does cold damage on a hit and applies a mark to everyone within 2
squares whether it hits or not. If a marked enemy tries to flout the mark (i.e,
make an attack that doesn’t include the archon as a target) it gets smacked with
an attack that does cold damage and weakens.</p>

<p>Now <em>that’s</em> a proper soldier monster.</p>

<h2 id="other-monster-vault-archons">Other Monster Vault Archons</h2>

<h3 id="earth-archon">Earth Archon</h3>

<p>This level 12 brute has 149 HP, earth walk, tremorsense, and is immune to
petrification in addition to the usual disease and poison. If it takes thunder
damage, it’s slowed for a turn.</p>

<p>It attacks with a stone warhamer for Brute damage, and has a powerful Avalanche
charge that does more damage and knocks the target prone even on a miss. This
last one recharges once it’s bloodied.</p>

<h3 id="water-archon">Water Archon</h3>

<p>A level 14 controller with 140 HP, a swim speed, and 20 acid resistance. It’s
slowed for a turn if it takes cold damage.</p>

<p>Its staff slows the target for a turn on a hit, and it also has an at-will
Whirlpool power that can hit everyone on a Close Burst 3 and slide them up to 3
squares. It’s an hilarious way to mess up the party’s carefully orchestrated
formation.</p>

<h3 id="archon-encounters">Archon Encounters</h3>

<p>There’s only one Monster Manual section with suggested encounters for all
archons. The general theme is “pair fire archons with other fire monsters” and
“pair ice archons with other ice monsters”.</p>

<p>I say it might be more interesting to mix up the elements, and have a
mixed-archon force face the PCs. That way it will be harder for them to protect
against all the types of elemental damage involved. The Monster Vault bears this
out with its presentation of a multi-element sentai team of similar
levels. There are no “suggested encounter” sections in the MV, but it’s obvious
you’re supposed to meet all four of its archons together.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>I find archons to be serviceable minions of the Primordials in concept, but the
Monster Manual batch seems to suffer from issues beyond those that can be
explained by early monster math. All of their attacks are too inaccurate, and
they generally work in a somewhat odd manner (like the ash disciple lacking an
at-will ranged attack). I’m guessing these were some of the first monsters
written for Fourth Edition.</p>

<p>Comparing the archons from both books side by side makes the MM ones seem
particularly janky, since the Monster Vault gives us a well-oiled elemental
sentai team where each archon has a very simple stat block that nevertheless
showcases what its role is supposed to be all about.</p>

<p>The one thing I prefer in the MM archons is their lack of vulnerability to their
opposiing element. It makes sense that they wouldn’t be vulnerable to each other
if they’re meant to work together, and it lets you spring a little “gotcha”
moment on PCs who think they’re clever for thinking fire pokemon are weak
against ice.</p>

            <p>…and I gather it’s kind of a big deal. There’s quite a few “Actual Play”
streams following the same format, and I’ve seen a few posts by different people
commenting on how it brought a large influx of new players to the RPG hobby in
general and to D&amp;D in particular.</p>

<p>The tone of these posts has varied. A couple were all about how the show sets
somewhat unrealistic expectations on new players because the cast and game are
so awesome. One, by a genuine scion of the Old School, went the other way and
lamented that the hobby was truly damned if Critical Role is what Kids These
Days consider a good game<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I guess I’m somewhere in the middle? I’ve been at this long enough to know every
group is going to have its own style, and I’ve been burned by enough flame wars
to accept that a given style isn’t bad because it’s different from mine.</p>

<p>For example, I’ve come to accept that uncut videos of 5-hour game sessions
aren’t my preferred medium for following other people’s games. Give me a
well-written and well-summarized text report any day of the week! Still, the
videos I did watch did provide me with at least one take-away I can use in my
own games: do the voices!</p>

<p>Sure, the Critical Role group is entirely composed of trained voice actors, but
even if you’re not one of them you can still add a little something to every
NPC. Perhaps a simple but distinctive mannerism, or a slight change in
pitch. Tiny changes that anyone can do and which might be enough to make your
characters more memorable. I used to do that a lot more in the past, and now
that I see how effective it can be for people on the receiving end I’m going to
start doing it again.</p>

<p>If you’re a player, then you can do the same for your own PC. At the very least
it will help others to know when you’re speaking in and out of character.</p>

<p>Watching the videos themselves is kinda fun: you can see that this is a
well-oiled group that has been playing for a while. They obviously enjoy each
other’s company and are very much into the game. Watching them in action
sometimes kinda makes me want to join the group, impossible though it might
be. I don’t often get to be a player.</p>

<p>I get why people say it feels railroaded, though I don’t necessarily agree with
them. You’re watching a full game happen but have neither any input on how it
develops, nor any access to the GM’s notes. There’s no real way to know how much
material<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> goes unused, nor how much is created between sessions or improvised
on the spot in response to player’s decisions.</p>

<p>Of course, my inner grognard can’t help but notice that while Matt Mercer is
very skilled, he does have a different style from mine. I can’t help but think
there are a few things I would do differently if I was in his position.</p>

<p>The first is that when a PC attacks an enemy he describes everything himself,
from the PC’s actions to the monster’s reaction. The only exception seems to be
when a PC takes down a boss. Years of playing Exalted have hardwired me to
always let players describe their own actions, thankyouverymuch.</p>

<p>The second is that he interprets every hit in combat as resulting in physical
wounds, which leads to some quite gory descriptions at times. Sometimes I
actually start to pity some of the high-HP monsters they fight. I like systems
such as GURPS or Dragon Heresy because they make a clearer distinction about
what’s a wound and what isn’t.</p>

<p>There’s a third thing, but you didn’t pass your Perception check for this
paragraph so you don’t see it.</p>

<p>In the end I guess I’ll probably resort to things like <a href="http://www.projectderailed.com/critical-role-recap/">this recap site</a> when
I want to keep up with the Critical Role campaign. It’s not quite the same
thing, but it does the job of conveying what happened in a session a lot faster.</p>
