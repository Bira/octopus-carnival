<p>This article is part of a series! You can find all of them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Chuuls are large lobster-like beings with yellowish shells, a semi-upright
posture, and a mass of little red tentacles dangling from their faces. They’re a
mainstain of the Underdark in every edition they appear in, including this
one. They didn’t appear on the Monster Vault, but later on they got a Monster
Vault-style update in Dungeon #192, so we’ll be looking at that as well.</p>

<p>Chuuls are Aberrant Magical Beasts (aquatic). We saw the aquatic keyword
already, back when we read about aboleths, but I don’t think I explained
it. Aquatic creatures suffer no penalties for operating underwater and usually
have a swim speed. They also get bonuses when fighting non-aquatic enemies
underwater.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>As magical beasts, chuuls are sapient. They’re not very smart, with Int 4, but
they’re conversant in Deep Speech. They lurk in underwater lakes, still pools
and other sufficiently large bodies of stagnant water, and emerge to snatch prey
with their huge claws.  Chuuls don’t care if that prey is sapient, and will eat
every single part of their bodies except for the brain, whose taste the
creatures dislike. Predictably, this makes them good neighbors to mind flayers,
who will use a chuul pool as a dumping ground for brainless bodies.</p>

<p>The Dungeon article adds a bit more lore. Chuuls live in small groups called
pods, in bodies of still water large enough to support them. They’ll happily use
rivers and seas for long-distance travels, but there’s nothing like an
underground lake or still swamp to settle down and raise your kids. These
creatures only have two ambitions in life: to be left alone and to eat
people. When the first one is frustrated, it means they’re about to satisfy the
second.</p>

<p>Chuuls reproduce by laying sacs of slimy yellow eggs, which they protect
fiercely. Sometimes they’ll attach these sacs to the bottom of ships or
riverboats as a way to help the species propagate further.</p>

<p>As chuuls grow older, they grow bigger and sometimes develop psychic
powers. They also <em>mutate</em> very easily, which makes them a preferred subject for
mind flayer experimentation, and might give even wild chuuls a few extra
interesting traits. Finally, they all share a kind of racial memory. An
individual will remember its previous generation very clearly and have a dimmer
recollection of the ones that came before. One memory from the dawn of time
remains very strong, however: hate humans. Kill them. Devour them.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>In both the Monster Manual and the Dungeon article, we get the same two
varieties of this monster:</p>

<p>The classic <strong>Chuul</strong> is a Level 10 Soldier with 109 HP. It’s Large, has
darkvision and both a walking and a swimming speed of 6. Its basic attack is a
claw whose damage is exactly half of what it should be for its level, but that’s
surprisingly okay here because the chuul can make 2 claw attacks per turn
despite not being Elite. These do extra damage against immobilized targets.</p>

<p>If both attacks hit the same target, the Chuul will make a attack against the
victim’s Fortitude using its face tentacles. This does no damage, but
immobilizes on a hit. The tentacles also figure in the Tentacle Net ability, a
passive which automatically immobilizes anyone hit by the chuul’s opportunity
attacks.</p>

<p>The chuul’s ambush predator tactics make it seem like a lurker, but I guess it
doesn’t try to hide again after first emerging, though it prefers to stick to
the water. The Dungeon/Monster Vault version has better claw damage, but is
still largely the same.</p>

<p>Next we have the <strong>Chuul Juggernaut</strong>, a Level 23 Elite Soldier with 434 HP
that’s either very old or was experimented on by mind flayers. It’s Huge, has
ground and swim speeds of 7 and also psychic powers! Psychic Lure is a ranged 10
attack against Will that does psychic damage and pulls the target 5 squares on a
hit. The Juggernaut otherwise fights like the classic model, but is much less
shy about leaving the water. We’re back to having to fix its damage: as an elite
it’s supposed to make two full-damage attacks and not two half-damage ones. This
damage fix is exactly what the Dungeon version does, being otherwise identical.</p>

<h2 id="encounters">Encounters</h2>

<p>The first is level 10, 2 chuuls, a feymire crocodile, and a bog hag. Just to
show you these things also live on the surface and associate with people that
are not mind flayers.</p>

<p>The second is level 23, a chuul juggernaut and three blood fiends. I got nothing
on this one.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The chuul lore in the MM didn’t exactly spark joy, y’know? The additions from
the update make them more interesting in that front. Mechanically they’re solid
opposition, as evidenced by the fact that the update didn’t do more than
increase their damage a bit.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>In the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2019/08/05/dnd-to-ravenloft.html">last post on this subject</a>, I talked about how I accidentally
hijacked a D&amp;D 5th Edition game and turned it into a GURPS Dungeon Fantasy game
using the old-school Ravenloft module for AD&amp;D. Today, I’ll tell you about how
Ravenloft claimed yet another party of ill-fated adventurers.</p>

<p>I don’t think the group actually realized how close they were to winning. It was
almost entirely a psychological defeat. The place was scary and unknown, the
random encounters hard, and they spent the first couple of sessions treating it
like a Diablo dungeon (“run in as fast as possible and kill everything that
moves!”). After that, they became overly cautious, retreating to the chapel
every couple of fights to spend the night and let those healing penalties fade.</p>

<p>They’d inevitably wake up to a random encounter. No, undead can’t enter the
chapel, but those two rust monsters I rolled up that one time sure could! They
didn’t wreck any equipment, but they scared the players just the same.</p>

<p>This became the usual pattern of our sessions, and if it kept up the group would
end up allowing the monsters to slowly grind them to death. I told them as much,
and cautioned them to explore the castle in a more directed and organized manner
if they wanted to win.</p>

<p>That led to a rather fruitful session where they moved with purpose and reached
the room where Strahd’s maid lived. She pleaded for help and offered to lead
them to a stash of treasure in exchange for help in escaping the castle. The PCs
agreed.</p>

<p>She led them up the stairs, staying towards the back of the group for
safety. When they reached the “treasure room”, the maid sprouted claws and fangs
and backstabbed the party, because of course she was a vampire and the treasure
was fake.</p>

<p>They managed to defeat the vampire maid without suffering too much damage, and
it turned out that all of this happened right in front of the door to the throne
room, where I6’s tarot reading told me Strahd himself could be found.</p>

<p>So there they were, mostly unhurt, with a cleric and a paladin in the party, in
possession of both the Icon of Ravenloft and the Sunsword, literally at Strahd’s
doorstep. What did the PCs do? They ran away! The rest of the session was them
finding their way to the outside, still at the second floor, levitating over the
walls and making it back to Barovia.</p>

<p>We ended the session there, and we wouldn’t get to play another. One of the
players outright told me Ravenloft was too hard and he wanted something else, so
I offered to switch to Iron Gods the next session with a fresh batch of
characters. No one else complained or offered a dissenting opinion, so I guess
they agreed. Ravenloft had claimed another party, not by killing them but by
breaking their spirits.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure it was Ravenloft, too, as opposed to shitty GMing on my
part. The Iron Gods game is still ongoing and the players look forward to each
session, so I must be doing <em>something</em> right.</p>

<p>When I next write about this, we’ll see how that Iron Gods game started.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! You can find all of them <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Chokers are humanoid creatures with somewhat elongated heads and very long
rubbery arms ending in hands whose palms seem lined with sharp barbs. To better
choke you with, obviously. They’re only listed in the Monster Manual, but they
do get an update in Dungeon Magazine issue 196. This update is part of a series
of articles that are considered “missing pages from the Monster Vault”, so I’ll
cover them here as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The MM doesn’t offer much in the way of choker lore, but the Dungeon article
remedies that nicely.</p>

<p>Chokers love the Underdark but may be found in other favorable environments
closer to the surface, particularly near sapient settlements. You see, they
prefer hunting sapient prey, because in addition to being good eatin’ they often
carry the shiny baubles and jewels which these creatures love to collect and
occasionally fondle. Their arms are so flexible because their internal structure
is composed of many knobby cartilage joints.</p>

<p>Chokers typically live and hunt alone, because they’re so antisocial they see
even other chokers as prey. They gots shinies and meat on them just like anybody
else, precious. These creatures are however just smart enough to accept shiny
bribes in exchange for not eating someone, and sometimes drow or other
underground dwellers can hire them on that basis. Drow in particular don’t like
to do it very often, because they find chokers too unpredictable.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We have two varieties of choker statted up here, both Unaligned and possessed of
Int 6. I suppose this could mean not every choker the party meets is a bandit,
but I don’t think I ever saw any published friendly chokers.</p>

<h3 id="cavern-choker-monster-manual">Cavern Choker (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>This is a Small Natural Humanoid and a Level 4 Lurker with 42 HP. It has
darkvision, a ground speed of 6, and a climb speed of 6 with spider climb.</p>

<p>Its basic (and main) attack is the Tentacle Claw. Its Reach 2 is impressive for
a Small creature, and in addition to doing damage it also automatically grabs
the target on a hit. Grabs in 4e prevent the victim from moving, but not from
performing other actions. They can use an action to attempt to escape the
grab. For monsters without a listed escape DC, such as these chokers, the test
is either the victims Acrobatics vs. the monster’s Reflex, or Athletics vs. the
monster’s Fortitude. In this specific case the target takes a -4 penalty to the
roll to escape.</p>

<p>Some monsters have specific things they can do to grabbed victims. For example,
the cavern choker can use its standard action to choke a grabbed victim, an
attack which deals the same damage as the claw but targets Fortitude and has a
better chance of landing. When the choker is targeted by an attack against its
AC or Reflex, it can use an immediate interrupt to interpose the grabbed victim,
causing the attack to target <em>them</em> instead. This doesn’t work if the attack
comes from the victim itself, obviously.</p>

<p>The choker also has a Chameleon Hide, which it can activate as a minor action to
gain concealment for a turn. It can’t use this while grabbing someone, but it’s
useful for it to retreat using its considerable Stealth.</p>

<p>The tactics write themselves - the choker will lurk on a ceiling and grab
someone when they pass by, while its less sneaky buddies distract the rest of
the party.</p>

<h3 id="cavern-choker-dungeon">Cavern Choker (Dungeon)</h3>

<p>The Cavern Choker from Dungeon remains a level 4 lurker with 42 HP. The main
change from the MM is a significant upgrade to its Chameleon Skin, which now
gives <em>full</em> concealment and is always on as long as the choker doesn’t have
anyone grabbed.</p>

<p>The Choke attack is gone - now the Tentacle Claw does 10 ongoing damage to
grabbed targets until they escape. Escape attempts now have an explicit DC of
21, which is about the same as you’d get under the old rules. Body Shield has
had its text changed and clarified. It’s still an interrupt that redirects an
attack by someone else to the grabbed victim, but now it only recharges when the
choker hits with Tentacle Claw. This means that the monster can only use it
<em>once</em> after it grabs a target, making “grab, release on your next turn, grab
again” preferable to holding on until the target dies.</p>

<h3 id="feygrove-choker-monster-manual">Feygrove Choker (Monster Manual)</h3>

<p>This Medium Fey Humanoid is a Level 12 Lurker with 91 HP. A different species,
or the platonic ideal of the mundane choker? In any case its abilities are quite
similar. It has Reach 3 and can grab up to 2 targets simultaneously. When it has
2 grabbed creatures it can choke them both at once; it can use either creature
as a shield, but not against attacks made by either grabbed creature.</p>

<p>As an extra surprise, it can use a power named Vine Fetter, which animates
nearby vegetation in an Area Burst 3 within 10 squares. It targets the Reflex of
enemies in the area and restrains them (save ends) on a hit. This recharges on a
6 and will very likely be the opening move in a fight.</p>

<h3 id="feygrove-choker-dungeon">Feygrove Choker (Dungeon)</h3>

<p>The exact same set of changes also applies to the Feygrove Choker, which remains
a Level 12 Lurker with 91 HP. It can still grab two people instead of just one,
so it has more opportunities to use Body Shield. The damage fixes also have much
more of an impact on it, since it’s a higher-level monster.</p>

<h3 id="sample-encounter-and-final-impressions">Sample Encounter and Final Impressions</h3>

<p>The sample encounter is level 4: a pair of cavern chokers employed by a small
hobgoblin war party.</p>

<p>MM Chokers get a “meh” from me. I didn’t find them that exciting. I guess
they’re the sort of gimmicky Gygaxian monster you’d expect to find alongside
cloakers and piercers, but I didn’t find them appealing outside of that.</p>

<p>I like the additional lore from the Dungeon article, though it definitiely makes
it clear that chokers are more <em>monsters</em> than <em>people</em>. The stat updates are
welcome too. I’d normally just apply a damage fix to the MM stat blocks and call
it a day, but these come with some interesting changes like the boost to
Chameleon Skin.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This one has been sitting in my drafts folder for a while, and I figured it was
time it got finished and saw the light of day.</p>

<p>When I announced my post on <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2018/08/14/melta.html">Meltaguns</a> on the GURPS Discord server, the
following sentence from there generated a little discussion:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>There is pretty much no reason to use one of these instead of a
good anti-vehicle missile, but the Imperium of Man never cared for reason.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some of the people who were in there at the time disagreed with this
sentence. They attempted to explain their position<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, and while I still don’t
agree with them, I could kinda see where they’re coming from.</p>

<p>At the core of that logic is a strong impulse to suspend disbelief in the
setting and to willfully ignore the gaps between the fiction and the
rules<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. To look at the stuff depicted in the setting material and wargame
rules, and to build a chain of logic that makes it internally consistent. This
is an attitude shared by a lot of fans of the setting, and some of its writers
too.</p>

<p>I come at this from a different direction. At the core of my thinking about
Warhammer 40.000 is the fact that this setting is <em>utterly ridiculous</em>, and any
material I write about it will hold that idea within its heart. The Imperium are
a bunch of space nazis whose outlook, equipment, and strategies are entirely
oriented towards what would make the best heavy metal album cover. Their claims
that they are the only alternative to the end of humanity or even of the
universe are entirely bunk. I will <em>never, ever</em> take them the least bit
seriously or picture them in a sympathetic light. They will never be better than
a joke in my book.</p>

<p>The same goes for pretty much everyone else, though they likely prefer to pose
for album covers in different music genres<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I will gladly adapt stuff from that setting to GURPS, and I would even GM a game
in that setting, but in both cases I will always keep that ridiculousness in
mind, lampshade it at every opportunity, and make sure every shade of nazi in
there is an eminently punchable antagonist. As you might imagine, it’s not very
likely that I’ll end up playing in a game with people who take the Imperium at
its word, much less people who think it’s way of thinking applies to the real
world.</p>

<p>This article is part of a series! Go <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm-4e/">here</a> to see the other entries.</p>

<p>Chimeras come from Greek mythology, where as far as I know it was just <em>The</em>
Chimera. D&amp;D likes to make unique monsters into whole species, and this is what
happened here. I remember seeing them statted up for AD&amp;D 2nd Edition in the
past, and they’re quite likely much older than that. Here, they’re only on the
Monster Manual.</p>

<p>Chimeras in 4e have a lion’s body with a dragon’s wings and tail. Its three
heads all sprout from the front: the lion in the middle, a goat to the left, and
a dragon to the right. They’re Large Natural Magical Beasts, which means they’re
both native to the world and sapient. They speak Common and Draconic but aren’t
very smart, at Int 5.</p>

<p>A chimera behaves much like the less cerebral types of dragon: it stakes out
territory somewhere and roams the surrounding countriside looking for food to
line its stomach and shiny treasure to line its lair. Sometimes other creatures
will convince a chimera to work for them as muscle, guards, or mounts. They’re
Unaligned, but I guess a peaceful interaction with a chimera would be difficult
unless you can convince it you’re not prey.</p>

<p>A chimera is a Level 15 Elite Brute with 366 HP. It has both all-around vision
and darkvision, so it can hunt at night just fine and can’t be flanked. It also
has Resist 10 fire.</p>

<p>The chimera runs with speed 6, flies with speed 10 (clumsy), and has overland
flight 15. Creatures with overland flight can fly at the listed speed outside of
combat for extended periods, basically. You can run into a chimera quite far
from its lair.</p>

<p>In combat, the chimera will usually attack with all three heads: bites from the
lion and dragon, and a gore from the goat (which knocks prone in addition to
doing damage). The lion bite is its basic attack, but it can attack with all
three heads as a standard action. When it charges it uses the goat head, causing
a little more damage than the standing gore attack.</p>

<p>The dragon head can also breathe fire on a close blast 5, targeting Reflex and
doing fire damage plus ongoing 10 fire damage (save ends) to anyone it
hits. This is an encounter power, but when the chimera is bloodied it will
immediately recharge its breath and use it again as a free action. In other
words, it works exactly like the breath from a real dragon.</p>

<p>The pictured chimera breathes and resists fire because it has red dragon bits,
but they come in all the colors of Tiamat. Just change the element: a black
chimera would use and resist acid, a blue one lightning, and so on.</p>

<p>The suggested encounters are both level 15. The first is 2 chimeras and 2 hill
giants, and the second a chimera, an azer taskmaster, and 6 azer minion
warriors.</p>
