<p>In this article we finish our tour of Gransys by examining its capital of Gran
Soren, which is also its only settlement worthy of the name “city”. As there is
only one very specific place to deal with this time, you’ll get more details on
its history and layout, as well as important NPCs and a <strong>GURPS City Stats</strong>
writeup. This is the last post on the setting of Gransys. Next we’ll move on to
characters!</p>

<h2 id="a-tour-of-gran-soren">A Tour of Gran Soren</h2>

<p>Gran Soren became the capital of Gransys around the time Edmun Dragonsbane
became Duke, fifty years ago. Since then the fledgling town has grown into the
beating heart of all Gransys, as the pawns in the original game are fond of
saying whenever you approach its walls.</p>

<p>The city was built at the mouth of a river near the site of an ancient castle
that predates Gransys itself. Some of its walls still stand, and the roads in
the surrounding countryside weave through them. The city’s own walls are much
newer, and as sturdy as their builders could make them. The space inside them is
further divided into quarters.</p>

<h3 id="craftsmans-quarter">Craftsman’s Quarter</h3>

<p>This is where most of the city’s many workshops and guild halls
stand. Blacksmiths, builders, and other artisans work here. There’s even a small
field worked by tenant farmers. This quarter is also where the Pawn Guild is
located. Its leader is a pawn named Barnaby, who is more articulate than most of
his alien brethren. In addition to hiring out as mercenaries, they also guard a
secret in the guild’s basement: the entrance to a mysterious underground ruin
known to them as the Everfall.</p>

<p>Most weapon and item stores likely to cater to adventurers are in the Urban
Quarter (below), but this is where PCs would come to make large orders or to
hire a large workforce to build a manor or a boat. The Pawn Guild would also be
a frequent destination for groups that include Pawn PCs or that make use of NPC
Pawns.</p>

<h3 id="urban-quarter">Urban Quarter</h3>

<p>This is the city’s largest residential and commercial area. Many of the artisans
who work in the Craftsman’s Quarter have homes in this one, and it also hosts a
large permanent market that sees movement at all hours of the day.</p>

<p>This is where all the “adventurer-friendly” establishments are: inns, taverns,
and stores with large and varied inventories. Any non-magical item that doesn’t
need to be custom-made can be found on sale here, and the stuff that does can be
ordered easily. Fine-quality equipment and even minor magic items are often
found on display, too. Basic necessities such as food or clothes are
considerably more expensive in Gran Soren than in smaller towns or villages, but
their quality and variety is often higher than can be found in those smaller
locations.</p>

<h3 id="the-venery">The Venery</h3>

<p>This is technically part of the Urban Quarter, but you’ll definitely notice when
you’ve wandered into it. It’s the bad part of town, comprised of shabbier houses
and shadier businesses. It’s also where the river meets both the sea and the
city’s sewers. A slum has grown on its margins, and the city’s poorest
inhabitants dredge the mud looking for stray valuables.</p>

<p>There are few guards here, and those are the type that can be bribed to look the
other way. This makes the Venery the perfect meeting spot for criminals and
malcontents. Rumor has it that a skilled forger does business from here, and
it’s also the best place to buy illegal tools.</p>

<h3 id="noble-quarter">Noble Quarter</h3>

<p>This is where the other end of society lives. Somewhat smaller than the other
quarters, its area is mostly occupied by large mansions, an ornate cathedral,
the mint, and the Duke’s palace. Politically, the noble quarter is where all the
real action is at. Duke Edmun’s centralizing efforts mean that to gain favor
with him is to gain power, and the nobles and merchants who make their home here
engage in constant intrigue to do just that.</p>

<p>Others take alternate routes, brokering illicit deals right under the nose of
the Duke’s most loyal agents. Either way, the deals made here affect the entire
duchy.</p>

<p>The Duke holds court from his palace, and is always surrounded by a rotating set
of nobles and merchants. Aside from Edmun himself, other fixtures of the court
are his nephew Fedel and his chamberlain Aldous. Fedel holds the title of Count
of Aernst, but that is a mere formality, as Aernst Castle was attacked and razed
decades ago. Though Fedel is wealthy, he lacks the resources (and, some say, the
will) needed to retake and rebuild the castle. He currently lives in a mansion
in the noble quarter, and makes a living from trade.</p>

<p>Aldous also holds an honorary title (Count of Windbluff), and also has no
interest in claiming its associated land. He is the Duke’s Chamberlain, and the
one who actually conducts most of the day-to-day work of running the duchy. Most
who seek audience with Edmun will find themselves dealing with him instead.</p>

<p>The Noble Quarter is also where Fournival Frescobaldi, Gransys’ wealthiest
merchant, makes his home. He owns a lot of real estate in Gransys and smaller
towns, and his organization moves a lot of goods between these settlements. He
also deals in goods imported from foreign lands, both legally and illegally.</p>

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>First of all, a warning: <strong>this post mentions plot events that happen pretty far
into the story of the original game</strong>. With that out of the way, let us proceed!</p>

<p>If you know even a little bit about feudal societies, that bit about margraves
and castles in the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/05/gransys-overview.html">overview of Gransys</a> might have sounded a bit
strange or even nonsensical to you. What’s this about isolated castles who have
to receive their supplies and personnel from the capital instead of drawing them
from the surrounding lands? Isn’t that counter-intuitive, inefficient and prone
to all sorts of problems when done in a feudal society?</p>

<p>Yes, it is! Some of those problems are in fact a key plot element in the
original game, where poor logistical support causes a revolt against the Duke in
one of these castles. The game mentions a few other consequences of this
arrangement when they affect its story, but says little else about it. Here I
have a bit more space to explore why things work like this in this particular
setting. And once that’s done, we’ll show a couple of example castles drawn from
the game. No City Stats this time, but I hope the included plot hooks suffice.</p>

<h2 id="the-border-marches-of-gransys">The Border Marches of Gransys</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the post about <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/10/towns.html">towns</a>, the society of Gransys is in
a state of transition between TL 3 feudalism and TL 4 absolute monarchy. This
means that Duke Edmun is taking steps to centralize political power in the
capital (and thus, in his own hands), while facing resistance from the feudal
lords under him. The way the border castles are set up is a big component of
that.</p>

<p>Unlike what happens with towns and villages, here it’s entirely appropriate to
assume that the castles we see in the <a href="http://dragonsdogma.wikia.com/wiki/File:Gransys_map_large_w_labels.jpg">map</a> are all of them. There’s
the Greatwall and the Shadow Fort over in the west, and Windbluff Tower to the
east. They’re all located near some pretty dangerous terrain!  The first two are
literally on top of underground entrances leading to the monster-infested
mountain range to the west, and the last one is close to the mouth of a
similarly dangerous valley leading to Bluemoon Tower. They define the borders of
Gransys as much as the natural landmarks do.</p>

<p>Now, the way this would work in a purely feudal setting is that the dangerous
and important task of maintaining these bulwarks would come with the title of
<em>margrave</em>, which is pretty high up in the feudal hierarchy. The margrave gains
control of the castle itself and its surrounding lands, and the right to demand
tribute and service from their inhabitants. They are expected to use that right
to protect and tame those lands, which means they see more fighting than your
typical feudal lord. It also means they have more bargaining power than usual
when it comes to dealing with their liege.</p>

<p>The Duke has changed that traditional arrangement in this setting. Rather than
delegating this border protection duty to his vassals, he’s had the castles
built with his own resources and staffed with soldiers answering to him
directly. In our adaptation, the commanders of these forts are still called
margraves, but they get none of the traditional perks of the job. Instead, the
supplies for these forces come from the central government in a way similar to
how a modern military base works. This takes the form of a mix of material
resources, new recruits, and money for salaries and additional expenses. The
idea is that this gives him more direct control over the duchy, and limits the
number of uppity nobles threatening to secede if they don’t get special
privileges.</p>

<p>It works, up to a point. Gransys doesn’t enjoy the efficient logistics network
that a truly centralized state would have, and its transportation technology is
lagging behind other areas. This combined with the presence of monsters and
bandits <em>within</em> the duchy means that the forts are suffering from a chronic
resource shortage, which causes all sorts of morale problems. Each of the
castles have found a different way of dealing with this, but they don’t quite
cut it.</p>

<p>Someone intent on destabilizing the duchy would surely target these castles. And
that’s just what happens in the original game.</p>

<h3 id="the-shadow-fort">The Shadow Fort</h3>

<p>The Shadow Fort was built over an entrance to the Frontier Caverns, a vast
network of underground goblin warrens leading into the mountains to the west
beyond Gransys. Its commander has come to an arrangement with the mayor of the
nearby town of <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/10/towns.html">Hardship</a>, lending detachments of its soldiers to
police the lands around the town in exchange for extra supplies.</p>

<p>The Fort’s main problem is a shortage of personnel. Its current complement is
adequate for routine operation in relatively peaceful times, but the greatly
increased monster activity pressaging the next coming of the Dragon has greatly
increased the pressure on its soldiers. Reinforcements have been requested, but
it doesn’t look like they’ll arrive in time, if ever.</p>

<h3 id="windbluff-tower">Windbluff Tower</h3>

<p>Windbluff tower was built over the ruins of a castle that was the seat of power
for Gransys’ northern county. It guards the entrance of the Windworn Valley,
whose crags are home to a large number of bandits and smugglers. It’s been
particularly affected by the duchy’s logistics issues, with much of its actual
support coming from backroom deals with wealthy merchant Fournival Frescobaldi,
who supplies them in exchange for money and for access to those smugglers.</p>

<p>Since the money often comes from that reserved for the soldiers’ pay and
enabling smuggling goes directly against their mandate, morale here is
particularly bad. It wouldn’t take much to push them into open rebellion.</p>

<h3 id="the-greatwall">The Greatwall</h3>

<p>The largest of Gransys’ border fortresses, the Greatwall guards the approach to
the Tainted Mountain. The mountain and its environs are the site of a previous
draconic invasion, and the ruins located there are still home to some of the
peninsula’s most dangerous monsters.</p>

<p>The Greatwall doesn’t actually have many logistic issues, despite being in the
most inhospitable location of the three castles. In fact, the upsurge in monster
activity has caused resources meant for the other two castles to be diverted
here instead.</p>

<h3 id="the-dukes-manse">The Duke’s Manse</h3>

<p>Unlike the other three, the Duke’s Manse is a castle built and operated along
feudal lines! It controls the surrounding lands, which are the Duke’s personal
fief, and draws resources from them. Since the Duke already controls this area
directly, he is in no rush to change any of this. It’s usually administered by a
castellan, as the Duke spends most of his days in the capital.</p>

<p>Located north of Windbluff Tower, this place is self-sufficient and quite
isolated from the rest of Gransys. Few know what goes on in here. As we see in
the original game, there’s a reason why it’s labeled the “Blighted Manse” in the
map.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this article, we’ll discuss towns in Gransys. Unlike
the <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/06/villages-and-baronies.html">villages and baronies</a> we discussed in this series’ last post,
we actually do have an in-game example in the town of Cassardis. After talking
about what towns look like and what narrative themes they enable, we examine a
few possible sites for new towns in the map, and finish with two example towns
written using <strong>GURPS City Stats</strong>. One is new, and the other is Cassardis.</p>

<h2 id="towns-in-gransys">Towns in Gransys</h2>

<p>Towns are not just larger than villages, they’re also made up of more permanent
structures and generally less isolated. They see enough traffic and trade from
nearby settlements that they can host a perpetual market. They’re also more
likely to have walls, which will be either wooden palisades or stone structures.</p>

<p>While some of a town’s inhabitants are still farmers, they make up a smaller
portion of the population. The rest take up the kind of job that requires a
higher population to support - builders, professional traders, more specialized
artisans. A lot of villages have a blacksmith, but this is the smallest type of
settlement where you might find an armorer.</p>

<p>That’s usually enough for Dungeon Fantasy, but those who want to go deeper into
the social aspects of the setting can add some interesting hooks here. This is a
world transitioning between TL 3 and 4, and we can extend that to say that it’s
transitioning between a feudal, medieval economy and a monetary, Renaissance
one. The original game offers some support for this notion during the quests
related to Fournival, a merchant who holds no title but has quite a lot of pull
with the Court due to his fortune and business deals.</p>

<p>Towns, then, are where you begin to see the tension between these two economic
models. They don’t control a lot of farmland directly, but are the center of a
trade network that links all nearby villages, and part of a bigger network
connecting other towns further away. It’s quite possible for an enterprising
merchant or artisan to make their fortune in this system without ever holding a
formal title. Historically, these people were the original <em>burgeoisie</em>, a term
which means literally “those who live in cities”.</p>

<p>Therefore, it will be quite common for a town to be the stage of a conflict
between these wealthy merchants or artisans and the nobles that are supposed to
rule over them. Nobles that live away from the town in a rural manor will soon
find their townie subjects doing things behind their backs. Those who live in
town will face more direct resentment if they try to exert direct control over
its affairs. And, of course, there’s always the possibility that the nobles and
merchants collude to hoodwink the Duke.</p>

<h3 id="placing-towns">Placing Towns</h3>

<p>Cassardis is right there on the map, but it’s not the only town in
Gransys. Where should an enterprising GM place their own made-up towns? They
would make interesting replacements for the “rest encampments” present in the
original game. Those consist of a handful of tents inhabited by a guard who
performs the same functions as an innkeeper and by a peddler who can also
enhance weapons.</p>

<p>In an expanded world it would make logical sense for those spots to contain
actual towns, since these are the kinds of services one would be able to find in
them. Aside from the possible political conflict outlined above, the GM can take
a cue from the neighborhood monsters to determine what other problems would
plague each place.</p>

<h3 id="example-town-hardship">Example Town: Hardship</h3>

<p>The town of Hardship grew out of a logging camp, and took its name from the lake
on whose shores it was built<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Now it’s a trade hub for the villages around
the lake, and a rallying point for the caravans bearing tribute to Gran Soren
and supplies to the Shadow Fort. Since the latter are few and far between during
the best of times, Hardship’s mayor has long had an arrangement with the Shadow
Fort’s commander.</p>

<p>However, he’s had no luck in calling in those favors recently, as the fort’s
garrison has been too busy worrying about the goblins massing in the mountains
beyond Gransys to do something about the rumors of a dragon sighted in the
nearby forest. And it’s unlikely they could do anything to the ghosts that rise
from the lake at night. As if the biting, disease-carrying insects that rise
from it by day weren’t enough.</p>

<h3 id="example-town-cassardis">Example Town: Cassardis</h3>

<p>The coastal town Cassardis was settled hundreds of years ago by people from a
different culture than the one dominant in Gransys. Their dress and architecture
resembles that of our Mediterranean cultures. Until recently, it was completely
independent from the duchy.</p>

<p>Most of its hardy inhabitants are fishermen rather than farmers. Many actually
sail out in boats to harvest the bounty of the sea, which would sound downright
suicidal to an outsider. This fish-based diet is complemented by vegetables
grown in domestic gardens or in fields outside the town’s sturdy stone
walls. Cassardis fishermen also sell plenty of dried fish to the rest of
Gransys.</p>

<p>The people of Cassardis are long used to repelling monster attacks by
themselves, and a lot of them receive at least some combat training from an
early age. They are well-acquainted with the goblins plaguing the lightly
forested hills beyond the town’s fields. These attacks greatly increased in
frequency and intensity a while ago, which has prompted a drastic and
unprecedented decision from Adaro the village chief. He has requested help from
the Duke in exchange for allowing Cassardis to be annexed into Gransys.</p>

<p>Now Cassardis hosts a garrison of the Duke’s Men, and has to pay taxes and
tribute in exchange. Adaro is still chief, and though there is some ressentment
against him for the annexation no one can deny the soldiers help keep the town
safe.</p>

<p>In a Dragon’s Dogma campaign, as in the game, this town of badasses is the
perfect place for PCs to come from. Its self-reliant nature can help explain
where the PC’s adventuring skills come from, and its isolation from the rest of
Gransys is a perfect excuse for why they’re initially ignorant of the duchy’s
situation. It also has its share of problems that can be looked into, although
it’s generally a lot better off than places like the appropriately named
Hardship.</p>

            <p><strong>Update</strong>: This is the GURPS Dungeon Fantasy version of the character. If you
want to see a version for the Dungeon Fantasy RPG, click <a href="/octopus-carnival/2017/09/27/pathfinder-dfrpg-bard.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Another weekend, another iconic character converted to GURPS Dungeon Fantasy!
The next template in <strong>DF1</strong> is the Bard, which means that
after <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/gurps/2016/10/02/pathfinder-df-barbarian.html">Amiri the Barbarian</a> our next subject is Lem the Bard. Here he is:</p>

  <figcaption>By Wayne Reynolds, Copyright 2008 Paizo Publishing</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can find his full bio <a href="http://pathfinder.wikia.com/wiki/Lem">here</a>, and his original Pathfinder stats can
be found <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/npcCodex/iconic/lem.html">here</a>. From looking at them we can see the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lem was born a slave in the devil-worshipping nation of Cheliax. He escaped in
a rather fiery fashion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He hates slavery and slavers, and tends to side with the underdog in most
conflicts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lem has a sling and a shortsword, both sized for a halfling, but prefers to
use his magic in a fight. He mostly uses his bard song to bolster his allies,
and targets particularly tough foes with hindering spells to make them easier
to take down.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Given the information above, I feel we need to dip into two other DF books to
properly portray him. As Lem is a halfling, I’ll need the racial template from
<strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 3: The Next Level</strong>. And since the d20 Bard Song power
is core to his tactics, we’ll need its equivalent from <strong>GURPS Dungeon Fantasy
11: Power-Ups</strong>.</p>

<p>As before, the end result hits pretty much all of the same points as the
Pathfinder version. Lem’s weapons don’t do a lot of damage, so he’s a lot better
off relying on Bard-Song and spells. And while his spells aren’t exactly the
same as those of a Pathfinder bard, they still follow the “mostly hinder enemies
with a side of helping allies” motif. Good places to spend XP on would be more
spells and alternate song abilities.</p>

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Now that we have an overview of what Gransys and its settlements look like,
let’s take a more detailed look at a few specific locations in it, starting with
its settlements. Rather than providing an exhaustive list, I’ll describe a few
representative examples using <strong>GURPS City Stats</strong> rules. These will include the
two settlements we get in the original game, but also other made-up
examples. We’ll go by the order in which these communities are discussed in
<strong>GURPS Fantasy</strong>, from smaller to largest. This first article covers villages
and baronies, but it starts with a note on isolated homesteads.</p>

<h2 id="isolates">Isolates</h2>

<p>Gransys is a dangerous place at the best of times, never mind during a draconic
incursion. With all the bandits and wandering monsters prowling around, an
isolated homestead has about the same life expectancy as a snowball in an
oven. Some people still try, though. We find some of these in the original game:
every single one is an abandoned shell that is at best deserted, and at worst
home to the monsters or bandits who emptied it.</p>

<h2 id="villages">Villages</h2>

<p>This is the minimum viable settlement size in this dangerous land. Villages in
Gransys tend to house 200-300 people, living in wooden houses with thatched
roofs. These houses are made so they can be torn down and rebuilt relatively
easily in response to environmental changes or to move closer to
newly-productive land.</p>

<p>Villages have a small chapel of the Faith built out of stone, manned by a single
priest. The chapel’s grounds also contain the village’s graveyard. Villages not
located near a river or stream will have a well.</p>

<p>The vast majority of villagers are farmers, cultivating the land in a roughly 1
mile (1.6km) radius around the village itself. Few villagers travel much beyond
this radius, and even fewer go out further than the manor of their local
lord. Some will be artisans such as blacksmiths and tinkers who are capable of
supplying the village’s everyday needs. Smaller villages might lack even these,
relying on traveling peddlers who make a regular circuit between a set of
villages.</p>

<p>Baronies control about three adjacent villages, with the baron’s manor located
in one of them. Between servants, guards and the baron’s family, manor houses
contain about 50-60 people. Manorial villages also host markets are irregular
intervals, which draw inhabitants from neighboring settlements. Tribute
collectors go forth from the manor once a year to make a circuit of the barony’s
villages. Part of this tribute is sent on to Gran Soren, and part goes to
support the barony itself.</p>

<h3 id="placing-villages">Placing Villages</h3>

<p>The in-game map of Gransys doesn’t leave much room for villages or manors, but
as we already saw it’s compressed by a factor of 10 or so. Using the distances
we figured out earlier leaves plenty of space for these new settlements. Most of
them will occupy the “plains” on the map - stretches of relatively flat and open
terrain. Some will be near forests and occupy themselves with logging and
hunting - the latter especially on the north, which would bring in furs for
trade.</p>

<h3 id="example-grandvine-barony">Example: Grandvine Barony</h3>

<p>Individual villages, especially if they’re peaceful, are rarely interesting
locations to visit. So I cheated a bit for the example and statted up a
three-village <em>barony</em> using <strong>GURPS City Stats</strong>. It’s a little outside the
intended scope of the rules, but the numbers involved are small enough that they
still work out. I’ve also omitted the <strong>Language</strong> entry from the stats, as
we’re not working with multiple languages in this particular adaptation.</p>

<p>Grandvine Barony got this name due to the high quality of its manor’s vineyard,
but that was a long time ago. Located a few kilometers west of the ruins of
Aernst Castle, the barony has been hit especially hard by the bandits who made
the castle their base a few years ago. These ruffians took control of the trail
linking South and Central Gransys, and regularly attack tribute and trade
caravans going through it. They also sometimes raid the barony’s two outlying
villages.</p>

<p>Baron Alecto has a handful of trained soldiers at his disposal, but they are not
numerous enough to face the bandits directly. Combining them with a peasant
militia <em>might</em> work, but either way it would lead to losses he considers
unaceptable. Ser Alexa, his daughter and only heir, is much more
impetuous. Having just completed her knightly training, she wishes to rally the
neighbouring lords, raise the militia, and mount an assault on the ruined
castle. Standing on her way are her father’s concerns and the fact that the
neighbouring lords are much less personally affected by the bandit problem,
being further away from them and not that interested in sending tribute to the
Duke in the first place.</p>
