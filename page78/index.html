            <p>Before I start with the whole Dragon’s Dogma thing, I would like to discuss the
process of adapting a video game itself. It will help explain my decisions.</p>

<p>The excellent <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/products/gurps-adaptations">GURPS Adaptations</a> contains a wealth of detail on
how to adapt traditional fiction into an GURPS campaign, and while a lot of that
is equally applicable to adapting from a video game I feel there are some
important additional considerations. These concern <em>gameplay</em>.</p>

<p>“Gameplay” is a term that encompasses everything you do in the game as a player,
as well as the workings of these actions. Different genres of games give you
different levels of insight into these workings, from the intuitive feel you get
for your jumping distance in a platformer to all the numbers an electronic RPG
shows you.</p>

<p>Fiction has no gameplay. Even the longest fantasy novel with the most lovingly
described magic system will never make its readers do anything other than read
the text to see what happens next. Video games are the exact opposite of
this. Even the most immersive and story-intensive of games will always demand
that you pay as much attention to its gameplay as you do to its story and
setting.</p>

<p>If you think this sounds kinda similar to adapting from one tabletop RPG to
another, you’re getting it!</p>

<p>Essentially, adapting a video game into a tabletop RPG campaign presents us with
all the difficulties of adapting fiction <em>and</em> with all the difficulties of
converting material from a different game system!</p>

<p>The more transparent those mechanics are, paradoxically, the harder they make
the adaptation effort. When adapting mechanics, whether from a video game or
from other tabletop RPG, it’s very easy to fall into the trap of trying to
convert them as closely as possible. While that can be an interesting
intellectual exercise, it rarely generates a simple and practical result.</p>

<p>My preferred approach is to rely on the strengths of the “destination” system as
much as possible, adapting the fiction and trying to recreate the same feel of
the original mechanics without getting hung up on its details. Whenever the two
conflict in the original, the fiction takes precedence. For games that are part
of a franchise, I pick from the bits of setting information and mechanics that
give me the most coherent picture (or at least the picture I like the most).</p>

<p>In the end, I hope to have a campaign framework that is enjoyable to play and
fits GURPS idioms. And I hope you agree with me about the result :).</p>

            <p>Welcome to the Octopus Carnival! This blog serves two purposes: hosting my
English language RPG-related writing, and allowing me to learn how to use the
Jekyll site generation engine.</p>

<p>Why Jekyll? Because Tumblr has been getting on my nerves lately. I have a
Portuguese language personal blog in there, and while I was never assiduous in
maintaining it recent changes in the Tumblr user interface have made me even
less inclined to do so.</p>

<p>And why English? I’m not a native speaker, but pretty much anything RPG-related
I’ve done in the past handful of years, from reading books to preparing material
to playing the games, has been done in that language. It’s slightly easier for
me to think about games in English at this point. Plus, I want to be featured in
the <a href="https://gamingballistic.blogspot.com.br/p/gurps-day.html">GURPS Day summaries</a> over at Gaming Ballistic!</p>

<p>One of the biggest inspirations for this was the excellent and extensive
<a href="https://mailanka.blogspot.com.br/2016/07/a-psi-wars-primer.html">Psi Wars</a> series of articles on Mailanka’s blog, which aims to create
a Star Wars-like setting from the ground up. Adapting stuff from media to role
playing games has always been something I’ve been very interested in, and this
finally pushed me to try it publically.</p>

<p>As a first project, I intend to adapt some stuff from the Dragon’s Dogma video
game. I <em>think</em> it will be relatively easy to do, and a smaller task than Psi
Wars, but time will see if I’m wrong. In addition to that, I’ll post other stuff
as it comes to me, like one-off characters or rules.</p>
