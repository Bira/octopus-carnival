<p>Star Spawn made their debut in the <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/02/03/star-spawn.html">Monster Manual 2</a> along with a pretty
awesome chunk of lore that’s also tied to star pact warlocks and the Far
Realm. You can see it all on the link. This entry adds a bit more lore, new star
spawn, and a surprise epic boss!</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>The lore in this entry confirms some of the most terrible questions we had in
the MM2. Yes, if you travel far enough in space you do end up in the Far
Realm. Yes, there are things watching across this divide, and some of them are
perceived by the people of the middle world as stars. And yes, some of them have
hostile designs upon the world.</p>

<p>Allabar, the Opener of the Way, is one of these, and it travels across the
universe inciting its fellow stars to send their spawn into the world. Its
wanderings are not random, but filled with terrible purpose. Some warlocks claim
Allabar and its allies are at war with the world itself, and they call this the
Forgotten War because it’s much less noticeable than the Dawn War was but no
less significant.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>The star spawn presented here are all mid-to-high epic tier threats, making them
a lot stronger than the paragon-tier spawn from the MM2. All of them have the
aberrant origin and possess darkvision, but the specifics vary a lot between
individual stat blocks.</p>

<h3 id="spawn-of-ulban">Spawn of Ulban</h3>

<figure class="center">

<p>Ulban is a blue-white star whose intense glow affects mortal minds, disrupting
their cognition and robbing them of the ability to recognize danger. Ulban’s
influence starts ill-thought rebellions and prevents divinations of any sort
from working. Its spawn fall to the earth as meteors, and their presence makes
mortals unable to distinguish friend from foe. They also break the “no
tentacles” streak for this type of monster, as you can see in the illustration.</p>

<p>Spawn of Ulban are Medium Aberrant Humanoids, and Level 26 Controllers with 241
HP. They have a speed of 8. They’re immune to domination, and every time they’re
iht by a power that would dominate them, they dominate the attacker instead! And
this is a (save ends) condition even if the one from the attack wasn’t.</p>

<p>The spawn’s basic attack is the <strong>Bluefire Strike</strong> (vs. Reflex), which causes
both cold and fire damage, and dazes for a turn. It can also use a <strong>Touch of
Strife</strong> (vs. Will) instead, dealing psychic damage and forcing the target to
make a melee or ranged basic attack against a creature of the spawn’s
choice. When it hits with either of these attacks, it can apply a <strong>Psychic
Boost</strong> as a free action, dealing an extra chunk of psychic damage. This
recharges every time the spawn takes psychic damage, so while it’s not
<em>resistant</em> to this damage type you still don’t want to use it against the
spawn.</p>

<p>Less often, the spawn can produce a <strong>Ripple of Betrayal</strong> (close burst 1
vs. Will, recharge 5+) which deals psychic damage and dominates those it hits
(save ends).</p>

<p>As a minor action, the spawn can use <strong>Far Realm Reflection</strong> to form an
eldritch bond with a creature it can see. Whenever that creature shifts, the
spawn can immediately shift an equal number of squares. This lasts until the end
of the encounter, or until the spawn switches targets by using the power
again. An excellent power to use on an ally that can shift long distances, or
even on a PC that can do the same.</p>

<p>The Spawn of Ulban wants to get in close and stay there, since its attacks are
all melee or close bursts. It’s extremely effective against parties with lots of
psionic PCs, or against those that have lots of Essentials martial
characters. The best way to fight it is to keep your distance and hit it with
non-psychic, non-dominating attacks.</p>

<h3 id="emissary-of-caiphon">Emissary of Caiphon</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-caiphon.png"/>

</figure>

<p>Caiphon is a purple star that can always be found near the horizon, sometimes
even during the day. It presents itself as a helpful guide star, but will
sometimes betray those who rely on it, leading them down tragic paths.</p>

<p>The Emissary of Caiphon is often employed in these betrayals. It’s the most
human-looking of all star spawn, and it mimics the tactics of its patrons by
posing as a guide or a prophet. Its “wise and helpful” advice usually leads to a
lot suffering and death.</p>

<p>The Emissary is a Medium Aberrant Humanoid, and a Level 28 Controller with the
Leader tag and 257 HP. It projects an <strong>Aura of Ruin</strong> (2) that inflicts a -2
penalty to saves, and whenever it’s hit by an attack that would blind it, it
blinds the attacker instead (save ends).</p>

<p>Nearly all of the Emissary’s powers mess with the saving throw mechanic, but it
lacks the ability to inflict (save ends) conditions by itself. Be sure to pair
it with plenty of monsters who can do that!</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a <strong>Touch of Despair</strong> that deals light physical damage and
inflicts an extra 20 damage the first time the target fails a save before the
start of the emissary next turn. It’s nifty, but it’s for emercencies only. The
creature prefers to stay far away and use its ranged attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Blinded By Greed</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will) deals light psychic damage, slides the
target 2 squares, and forces them to make a melee basic attack against a target
of the emissary’s choice (“Give me that! It’s mine!”).</p>

<p><strong>Blinded By Need</strong> (ranged 10 vs. Will) deals standard psychic damage, and
allows the emissary to choose one of the target’s allies. For the next turn, the
target is marked by that ally, and everyone except the chosen ally is invisible
to the target. This doesn’t <em>force</em> the target and the ally to fight each
other, but it makes it hard for either of them to do anything else.</p>

<p>As minor actions, the emissary can use <strong>Deceptive Veil</strong> to disguise itself as
a Medium or Small humanoid, with a DC 40 for people to see through the
illusion. It can also target someone with an <strong>Invocation of Calamity</strong> (ranged
5 vs. Will), which on a hit makes the target fail all of their saves during the
next turn.</p>

<p>For triggered actions, it has the same <strong>Psionic Boost</strong> as the Spawn of Ulban,
this time applying to tis Blinded By Need/Greed powers. And when it dies,
<strong>Foretelling the Doom</strong> targets an enemy suffering from a (save ends) condition
and inflicts a -5 penalty on all saves against it until one succeeds.</p>

<h3 id="serpent-of-nihal">Serpent of Nihal</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-nihal.png"/>

</figure>

<p>Nihal, the Serpent Star, is a reddish celestial body that can’t stay still. It
travels a random snaking route around the point it was supposed to occupy in the
sky according to all standard calculations. That’s why it received this
epithet.</p>

<p>The Serpents of Nihal first came through the world shortly before the fall of
the ancient empire of Az-Kiral, which dedicated itself to the worship of
Zehir. Its leaders grew ever more ambitious and soon they craved more power than
the snake god was willing to offer. So they sought out a new source of Snek
Power, and found it in Nihal. They opened a portal to the star thinking they
would be able to access this power. What happened instead was that countless
Serpents of Nihal poured through, and destroyed the empire in a matter of
days. They still wander the known cosmos today, and I guess sometimes Allabar
opens new rifts to let more through.</p>

<p>Serpents are Medium Aberrant Beasts, and Level 29 Minion Lurkers with a ground
speed of 7. They’re only partially present in reality, and keep blinking in and
out.</p>

<p>This means that, despite being minions, they have <strong>Resist 20 to all
damage</strong>. Yes, even untyped. You need to deal 21 or more damage with one strike
to take them out. It’s not that hard for late epic PCs, but it’s also not 100%
guaranteed, so they have more staying power than your typical minion.</p>

<p>Serpents attack with <strong>mindbites</strong>, which deal psychic damage and can interfere
with concentration and psionic power usage: if 2 or more of the serpent’s allies
are adjacent to the target, the bite deals extra damage and prevents the target
from spending action points or power points (save ends).</p>

<p>If an enemy misses the serpent, it can <strong>Depart Reality</strong>, removing itself from
play for a turn an re-appearing in adjacent to an enemy within 20 squares of its
original location. It can also do this exact same thing when it rolls initiative
with the <strong>Sudden Reality Warp</strong> ability.</p>

<h3 id="allabar-opener-of-the-way">Allabar, Opener of the Way</h3>

<figure class="center">
  <img src="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/assets/wir-mm3-4e-star-spawn-allabar.png"/>

</figure>

<p>Yup, you read that right. This is not a star spawn, it’s a <em>star</em>. Allabar is
here to serve as the end boss for a campaign focused on the Forgotten War, which
would likely feature the PCs facing and unraveling the plans of increasingly
powerful aberrant creatures and star spawn until Allabar itself decides to
personally kill them. As the lore implies, Allabar is not the only eldritch star
who wants to mess with the world, but it’s the most consciously malicious one
and it acts as instigator and enabler to the others. Eliminating Allabar would
effectively end the threat posed by its fellows and their respective star spawn.</p>

<p>Putting the lore in astronomical terms would make Allabar similar to a rogue
planet, a planet without a star that moves across the universe. The similarity
is only superficial, of course, because pretty much nothing else about the
Opener of the Way is in any way scientific.</p>

<p>Allabar is presented here as a Gargantuan Aberrant Animate. Those who feel even
Gargantuan is too small for a planetary entity might instead say this is an
avatar of Allabar, the thing it sends through a portal to personally fight the
PCs. When it dies, the star winks out from the sky. Or you can take a page from
Atropus in Elder Evils, and have the actual body of Allabar be the
dungeon/battlefield on which you fight its avatar.</p>

<p>Anyway, Allabar is a Level 30 Solo Soldier with 1100 HP. It has ground and
flight speeds of 6, with Hover. As a planet, it projects a <strong>Gravity Well</strong> that
acts as a 20-square wide aura. This plus its Gargantuan size pretty much mean it
covers the entire battle map. Anyone who starts their turn inside the field gets
pulled a variable number of squares depending on how much HP Allabar currently
has. It starts at 1 square, and doubles for every 25% of its HP that are missing
(at 25% or less total HP, it’s 8 squares).</p>

<p>Being covered with eyes, Allabar has <strong>All-Around Vision</strong>, and can’t be
flanked. Its <strong>Bloodied Fury</strong> also gives it an extra standard action per turn
while it’s bloodied, even when it’s dazed.</p>

<p>In combat, the Opener of the Way projects Reach 4 <strong>Tentacles</strong> to attack, which
deal light physical damage and restrain for a turn on a hit. It can use them in
a <strong>Triple Attack</strong> to strike three times in a standard action, and it can
enhance a tentacle attack with a <strong>Psionic Boost</strong> similar to that of the star
spawn in this entry. Aside from the boost recharging when Allabar takes psychic
damage, it also recharges when the star succeeds with its <strong>Devour Body</strong>
attack. This Close Burst 1 vs. Fortitude targets creatures who are at 0 HP or
lower. On a hit, it kills the target and pulls it inside Allabar. It <em>can</em>
target dead allies, but it’s also excellent for making PCs exercise those “when
you die” abilities they surely have by now.</p>

<p>Another very interesting attack is <strong>Wrath of the Forsaken World</strong> (close blast
5 vs. Fortitude, recharge 5+), which deals psychic damage and causes each target
to sprout a hostile tentacle (save ends). While the tentacle is there, it deals
an automatic 20 damage to any target that ends their turn within 2 squares of
the victim.</p>

<p>As a minor action, you know, no big deal, the Opener can use <strong>Unravel Essence</strong>
(melee 4 vs. Fortitude), which inflicts 20 ongoing damage on a hit (save
ends). On the first failed save, this increases to 25. On the second, the target
also becomes weakened and insubstantial. On the third, the target drops to 0 HP
if its HP was still positive. A successful save at any point halts the process
and clears all related conditions. This recharges whenever there are no
creatures affected by it.</p>

<p>And finally, when someone hits Allabar with an attack, it can cause <strong>Psychic
Feedback</strong> as a reaction, automatically dazing the attacker (save ends).</p>

<p>Allabar is very intelligent and will work to maximize its advantages, abusing
its flight and superior reach, and focusing fire make them drop to 0 HP quickly
so they can be devoured. And if your level 30 PCs are cocky because this end
boss is “only” level 30, add a few Emissaries of Caiphon to make it impossible
for them to pass the many saves imposed by the Opener of the Way.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>The awesome continues! This entry does return to the old standby of “tentacles”,
but the monsters are still pretty evocative and their mechanics
interesting. Allabar reminds me of Atropus, from Elder Evils, but it’s has more
of an aberrant/psychic theme instead of Atropus’ undead/necrotic leanings.</p>

<p>The Opener of the Way is the fourth and last epic boss to be found in this
book. The previous ones were Imix, Lolth, and Ogrémoch.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

            <p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>Not only have monstrous spiders been in the game since the beginning, they’ve
been on every monster book we read so far. The MM3 is no exception in this
case.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>Looks like the Web Walk trait was a <a href="/octopus-carnival/2021/01/05/spider.html">Monster Vault</a> innovation. The spiders
in the MM3 don’t have it, but it would make sense for them to do so. They do
already use fixed math, like the other monsters in this book.</p>

<p>All spiders here have a climb speed equal to their ground speed, with the Spider
Climb keyword to signal that they can also walk on ceilings. They also have
Tremorsense 5.</p>

<h2 id="ambush-spider">Ambush Spider</h2>

<p>Sometimes you have to go back to basics, and you can’t get any more basic than
this. These Medium natural spiders behave much like mundane trapdoor spiders,
using webs to camouflage their hidey-holes and charging out of them to bite and
inject venom into their prey. As Level 2 Lurkers with 28 HP, they’re likely the
first giant spider any group of adventures is going to face. I’m surprised
something like this only showed up in the MM3. Their speed is a breezy 8.</p>

<p>The spider’s <strong>Camouflage</strong> trait allows it to hide when it has only partial
cover or concealment. Its basic attack is a <strong>bite</strong>, but it turns into a
<strong>Venomous Bite</strong> if made against a creature the spider is hidden from. This
does the same damage and can be used in a charge. It also slows the target and
inflicts 5 ongoing poison damage (save ends). This worsens to immobilized after
the first failed save.</p>

<h2 id="spiderling">Spiderling</h2>

<p>Spiderlings are immature giant spiders, merely Small in size. This is a generic
stat block that can be used to represent youngsters of any of the spider species
presented here or elsewhere. They’re Level 4 Minion Skirmishers with Speed 6 and
a basic bite attack.</p>

<p>The attack deals only 2 poison damage, but it also gives poison vulnerability 5
to the target for a turn. If the target is already vulnerable to poison their
vulnerability increases by 2 instead. This means that multiple spiderling bites
on the same victim add up very fast, particularly if the adults join in at the
end. You can vary their level based on the expected level of the adult
specimens.</p>

<h2 id="feyspitter-spider">Feyspitter Spider</h2>

<p>This spider native to the Feywild produces a venom laced with psychedelic
fairy-tale qualities. Aside from the usual physiological damage, it also forces
its victims to dance uncontrolably! Over time, feyspitter hunting grounds come
to look like clearings where the vegetation has been stomped flat by all the
dancers.</p>

<p>Feyspitters are Medium Fey Beasts and Level 7 Controllers with 80 HP and a Speed
of 6. Their <strong>bite</strong> deals physical damage and inflicts 5 ongoing poison damage
(save ends). Each time the victim fails a save, the spider can slide them 3
squares.</p>

<p>They can also use <strong>Poison Spittle</strong> to spray their venom in a Close
Blast 3. This deams 10 ongoing poison damage on everyone it hits, with the same
sliding effect on each failed save. Finally, if hit in melee, feyspitters can
use a <strong>Fey Leap</strong> (recharge 5+) to teleport 3 squares as an interrupt. Yes,
this means they can jump out of melee range and negate any damage.</p>

<h3 id="lolths-reaver">Lolth’s Reaver</h3>

<p>Another epic level spider directly associated with Lolth. These spiders don’t
exist in the wild. Instead, they’re bred by Lolth’s worshippers and fed the
blood of elves, eladrin and angels from an early age. Their upbringing makes
them sapient and Chaotic Evil. They commonly serve as mounts for Abyssal Drow,
and can also be found as pets and guardians in Lolth’s mightiest temples
elsewhere in the universe.</p>

<p>Reavers are Large Elemental Beasts with the Mount and Spider keywords. They’re
Level 25 Brutes with 287 HP. They have a ground speed of 8, but their Climb
speed is only 6. Their mount trait is <strong>Web Saddle</strong>, which prevents their rider
from being involuntarily dismounted by forced movement. I never even knew this
was a possibility for anyone else, so I find this very interesting. Enough PCs
have easy access to forced movement that staying mounted might very well be a
problem for an enemy rider in most situations. Not here, though.</p>

<p>Reavers fight with their extremely venomous <strong>bites</strong>, which deal light physical
damage and inflict 20 ongoing poison damage (save ends). They can shoot
<strong>Grasping Threads</strong> at range, which deal no damage but pull the target 5
squares and restrain them (save ends). Each failed saving throw causes the
reaver to pull the target an additional 5 squares. There is no hard limit on the
number of targets that can be restrained in this way.</p>

<p>Once per encounter the reaver can perform a <strong>Web Leap</strong>, jumping 8 squares
without provoking opportunity attacks and spreaying a Close Blast 3 with sticky
webs when they land. This does heavy physical damage, knocks its targets prone,
and prevents them from standing up (save ends).</p>

<h3 id="spider-webs">Spider Webs</h3>

<p>This is not a monster, but a side box with example terrain features based on
spider webs. All of the spiders in this entry and most of the ones in previous
books are web-spinners, so these should see heavy usage in arachnid-themed
dungeons.</p>

<p>These hazards have variable DCs and attack rolls based on their level, which
should be similar to that of the overall encounter. The more badass the spider,
the more badass its webs.</p>

<p><strong>Web Sheets</strong> are nearly invisible vertical webs, usually placed across
passages and corridors. Spotting them requires a Perception test against the
hard DC for their level. When someone enters their space, they attack the
victim’s Reflex and immobilize them (save ends). A close or area fire attack
destroys the whole web, a melee fire attack destroys one square of it.</p>

<p><strong>Cobwebs</strong> are thick and opaque sheets of webbing covering walls, floors, and
ceilings. Spiders use these for concealment, hiding behind them until it’s time
to burst out and strike. They provide total concealment, and spiders can usually
perceive enemies through them using tremorsense. They might also count as
difficult terrain.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>We’re starting to repeat ourselves a bit with all these spiders, but it’s nice
to see a low-level example. I also really liked the Feyspitter for its dancing
venom.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2022/10/23/orchard-of-time.html">The Orchard of Time</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I had an interesting dream recently that gave me what I think is a neat idea for
a dungeon location: The Orchard of Time.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>It’s started out as your standard divine orchard, a bit like the Garden of the
Hesperides. It was owned and operated by a powerful spirit or minor deity, and
its trees gave fruit that ranged from “mundane but high-quality” to “outright
miraculous” the further in you went. If you got to the very center, you could
harvest the Peaches of Immortality or something equally awesome.</p>

<p>Something happened to the Orchard’s original owners and they left, abandoning
the place. Monstrous fauna from the surrounding regions moved in and either
overwhelmed the previous guardians or entered some sort of symbiosis with
them. These new monsters found ample food in the trees of the Orchard, whose
energies mutated them to be larger and stronger.</p>

<p>One day, a powerful arch-wizard found the Orchard’s location and decided to go
for the Peaches. This extremely arrogant individual was sure he would succeed
where all others have failed. After all, the others weren’t him! He armed
himself with his best spells and his best magic items, and teleported to the
Orchard’s entrance (can’t teleport into it from outside). Then he boldly strode
past the gate, and cast his most powerful magic.</p>

<p>This was a custom spell that would stop time everywhere in the Orchard except
for an area five meters or so in radius around the wizard himself. The idea was
that, with time stoped, the archmage could just walk up to the really good trees
in the center while dodging the place’s many inhabitants. If he needed to remove
any of them, he could bring them into the “active time” circle and use his other
magic to handle them one individual or small group at a time.</p>

<p>Of course, the wizard’s hubris got the better of him at exactly the worst
time. Maybe he had miscalculated when creating the spell, or maybe he made a
critical error when casting it. The fact is that our wizard just
kinda… exploded, leaving behind only his ornate metal staff.</p>

<p>Ironically, the spell itself worked exactly as planned. Even better in fact, as
the same error that deleted our wizard made it last forever. It’s centered on
the wizard’s staff, which stands planted on the ground just inside the Orchard’s
entrance gate.</p>

<h2 id="layout-and-hazards">Layout and Hazards</h2>

<p>The Orchard is located in a hidden valley and is bordered by tall forested
mountains. The climate can range from temperate to tropical depending on what
kind of fruit you want it to contain. As mentioned above, vestigial divine wards
prevent people from finding it with divination or from teleporting into it from
outside. It can still be found via good old-fashioned research, as its location
is recorded in ancient religious texts and in the unfortunate wizard’s own
notes. The wizard has also helpfully dispelled any magical defenses that
prevented people from just walking through the main gate.</p>

<p>The Orchard of Time was a little overgrown from its period of abandonment, but
still retains its characteristic layout. There are many trees but they’re spaced
far apart. Cobbled paths wind their way among them. Grass and other wild plants
reach up to a human’s knees between the trees and paths. This space used to be
taken up by a lawn and flower beds, but these have been overwhelmed by native
plants.</p>

<p>This means that despite covering a very large area, the Orchard has excellent
sight lines and a clearly navigable layout. You can see a good deal of its
significant landmarks from the entrance gate and it’s impossible to get lost
inside. These excellent sight lines work against intruders such as the PCs,
because they allow the many, many monsters and guardians that live here to see
them from far away. These creatures are all hostile, territorial, and generally
incapable of dialogue either because they have animal intellect or because
they’re some sort of construct. In the dream I had these monsters definitely
included a variety of Rodents of Unusual Size. There are almost more monsters
than there are fruit, and they all more or less converge on the location of any
intruders they can perceive.</p>

<p>Or they <em>would</em>, if time hadn’t stopped inside. The wizard’s staff is just
inside the entrance, and it projects a field of “normal time” in a 5-meter
radius around itself. Everything outside this bubble and inside the orchard’s
outer walls is frozen in time, and has been for a long time (decades?
centuries?).</p>

<p>PCs who want to succeed where the arrogant wizard failed need to carry the staff
with them. Getting close enough to a monster that it enters the “bubble” will
unfreeze the creature, and it will imediately attack. There might be a route
that allows them to avoid most of the creatures, but not all.</p>

<p>In addition to the copious monsters, the permanent time stop might have created
hazardous areas inside the Orchard, where space or time itself behave in harmful
ways. These might be almost impossible to detect until they’re inside the active
time bubble, which would make them reveal themselves in a dramatic fashion.</p>

<h2 id="why-go-there">Why go there?</h2>

<p>The most obvious reason to delve the Orchard of Time is to get its most awesome
fruits from the big trees at the center, like the wizard wanted to do. The
Orchard might also contain buildings of interest (such as libraries or treasure
vaults), along with the bodies of ancient adventurers who tried to delve the
place before the ill-fated wizard. Some of these might be legendary themselves,
and have died carrying their equally legendary gear.</p>

<p>A slightly alternate Orchard would have been invaded by the wizard while it was
still operational! In this case it’s going to be in pristine condition, with all
of its original guardians and security systems still in place. Even its <em>owners</em>
will still be around, frozen in time like flies in amber. Freeing them is an
excellent goal for more heroic sorts, or at least for sorts who need the
specific help whose divine entities are able to provide.</p>

<p>However, since those owners are frozen in time, they’re still going to be under
the impression that they’re being invaded by a cheeky wizard. And look at you,
carrying his staff around like that. Better talk fast!</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>This post is part of a series! Click <a href="/octopus-carnival/projects/mm3-4e">here</a> to see the others.</p>

<p>The Spawn of Kyuss were introduced in the Age of Worms adventure path,
originally published in Dungeon Magazine in 2005-2006, when it was run by
Paizo. Some of Kyuss’ most powerful servants were reprinted in the Elder Evils
supplement for 3.5e, and later got conversion stats in an early 4th edition web
enhancement file. This means this is technically not the Spawn’s 4e debut, but
it is the first time we get complete lore and lower-than-epic stats for them.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>In ancient times, Kyuss was a mortal magician and a charismatic cult leader, who
led his followers to a remote jungle region in order to establish a base. There,
he found ruins from an even more ancient pre-human civilization. With the
knowledge he learned from those ruins, the cultist sacrificed his followers in a
ritual to become a giant undead demigod whose body was made out of bright green
worms. The Worm that Walks spent a long time imprisoned outside the world, but
the prophecy of the Age of Worms foretells that he will return and devour the
world in what is basically a worm-fueled zombie apocalypse.</p>

<p>The Spawn of Kyuss are undead created by infecting corpses with worms plucked
from his own body. They’re easily distinguished by the wriggling mass of green
worms crawling all over them, inside and outside. They’re Kyuss’ agents in the
world and their presence presages his return. Even if the Worm’s return is not
imminent, these creatures might still be found performing some task that
furthers their patron’s interests, whether by themselves or allied with
cultists.</p>

<p>The first Spawn were Kyuss’ original followers, sacrificed in that first
ritual. Making new ones is a matter of performing a simple worm transplant from
a spawn to an available body, living or dead. The ones listed here are not
particularly smart, but it’s worth remembering that <a href="/octopus-carnival/2020/06/21/larva-mage.html">Larva Mages</a> are also
the spawn of Kyuss.</p>

<h2 id="the-numbers">The Numbers</h2>

<p>We get three varieties of Spawn here, all suitable as threats to Paragon-tier
parties. They’re Medium Natural Animates with a Speed of 5 and Darkvision, plus
the usual undead traits: immunity to disease and poison, a resistance to
necrotic damage, and a vulnerability to radiant damage. They’re also vulnerable
to fire - it burns the worms right up.</p>

<p>All of the spawn here can also transmit the Touch of Kyuss, which is basically
an infestation of evil supernatural worms. It’s treated as a Level 16 disease
resisted with Endurance (DC 25 to improve or 20 to maintain). Stage 1 makes the
victim regain only half hit points from spending healing surges, and causes them
to rise as wretches of Kyuss if they die. Stage 2 causes them to lose 2 healing
surges, and if they ever reach 0 surges they die and rise as Sons of
Kyuss. Stage 3 cuts to the chase and kills the victim right away so it can rise
as a Son.</p>

<h3 id="son-of-kyuss">Son of Kyuss</h3>

<p>These things look like zombies at a first glance, but they’re sapient and much
stronger. Their goal is to usually spread the “blessing” of Kyuss to as many
living people as they can. Though they’re not exactly geniuses at Int 6, they
can and will coordinate in order to accomplish it.</p>

<p>Sons of Kyuss are Level 13 Brutes with 158 HP. They project a <strong>Fear of Worms</strong>
aura which inflicts a -2 attack penalty to living creatures inside. Their basic
attack is a <strong>Slam</strong> that damages and exposes the target to the Touch of
Kyuss. It can also “shoot” <strong>Burrowing Worms</strong> in a Close Burst 1 (recharge
5+). A hit inflicts 10 ongoing damage, increasing to 15 on the first failed save
and to 20 plus stun on the second. If someone dies from this they immediately
rise as a wretch of Kyuss (see below). The wretch must be destroyed before the
victim can be raised.</p>

<h3 id="wretch-of-kyuss">Wretch of Kyuss</h3>

<p>An undead creature with a lower worm content than a full Son of Kyuss. It’s less
sturdy but still quite dangerous and quite contagious, being a Level 13 Minion
Brute. Its <strong>Slam</strong> deals light necrotic damage, and when it dies it bursts,
inflicting necrotic damage in a Close Burst 1 and exposing anyone hit by this
attack to the Touch of Kyuss.</p>

<h3 id="herald-of-kyuss">Herald of Kyuss</h3>

<p>These undead abomination were created from the bodies of angels sent by the gods
to stop the Worm that Walks. They’re Medium Immortal Animates (undead), and have
all the same traits as the other spawn. Also, they can fly at speed 6.</p>

<p>The Herald is a Level 16 Artillery monster with 116 HP. They have the same Fear
of Worms aura as the Son, plus a <strong>Writhing Host</strong> aura of the same size that
deals 10 necrotic damage to enemies caught inside. All of their attacks expose
the target to the Touch of Kyuss on a hit, making them the most contagious spawn
of all.</p>

<p>Their basic melee attack is a <strong>Rotting Caress</strong> that deals necrotic
damage. They can attack at range by making <strong>Writhing Pronouncements</strong> that deal
immediate and ongoing 5 necrotic damage. This worsens to 10 and a daze on the
first failed save, and to 15 and a stun on the second (save ends). People killed
by this turn into wretches of Kyuss, which must be destroyed before the victims
can be raised.</p>

<p>Once per encounter they can call an <strong>Eruption of Maggots</strong> that acts as a
disgusting fireball-sized area attack. It deals immediate and ongoing necrotic
damage, and also creates a damaging zone that lasts for the rest of the
encounter.</p>

<h2 id="final-impressions">Final Impressions</h2>

<p>Ewwww. Kill these with fire as soon as possible. If your GM is re-enacting the
Age of Worms campaign, you can expect to run into these things very often. Their
main gimmick is all about infecting people with the Touch of Kyuss, so PCs can
expect to stop and cast Remove Affliction more or less after every fight unless
they’re under extreme time pressure. Stage 1 is already a major debuff, and
staying at Stage 2 is a serious gamble.</p>

<p>Slaads have appeared in every 4e Monster Manual so far. This one gives us more
exotic varieties.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore">The Lore</h2>

<p>Basic slaad lore remains the same: technically sapient frog-like monsters from
the Elemental Chaos with lolrandom minds and a propensity to implant eggs into
other creatures. You can see the lore specific to each new variety in their
descriptions below.</p>

<h2 id="the-monsters">The Monsters</h2>

<p>As a reminder, chaos phage is a level 16 disease that represents being implanted
with a slaad egg. Stage 1 has no effect beyond this, stage 2 gives you a Will
penalty and makes you attack randomly while bloodied, stage 3 means the embryo
bursts out of your skull and kills you.</p>

<p>Like other diseases it’s not hard to remove with the right ritual, but the
symptoms are severe enough that you’ll want to do it sooner rather than
later. And as usual the ritual takes time and costs a bunch of healing surges,
so it’s something that might add time pressure to a slaad focused adventure.</p>

<h3 id="golden-slaad">Golden Slaad</h3>

<p>Slaads are mostly immune to the chaos storms that often rage through portions of
the Elemental Chaos, which is why they like to follow these storms around. When
one of these storms manages to affect a slaad, it can mutate it into a golden
slaad. Golden Slaads are revered by their chromatic brethren, who follow them
around as if they were a chaos storm themselves.</p>

<p>Golden slaads are even more chaos-infused than their relatives, and can inject
that raw chaos in any victims they bite. Their gold-colored forms are unstable,
and if they’re wounded they became unable to sustain those forms, becoming
quivering (but still dangerous!) piles of ooze.</p>

<p>These creatures are Huge Elemental Humanoids and Level 20 Controllers with 193
HP. They have a ground speed of 8 and a teleport speed of 6, as well as
low-light vision and an immunity to chaos phage (like all slaads).</p>

<p>Their <strong>bite</strong> is reach 3 and deals physical damage, with a random rider
depending on the result of the attack roll. If the roll is odd, it slides the
target 3 squares. If it’s even, it dazes them for a turn.</p>

<p>They can also emit <strong>Chaos Croaks</strong> in a Close Burst 5 (recharge 5+). This
targets Will, does psychic damage, and has a random rider rolled on a d6 table:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Target is teleported 1d6 squares in a random direction (rolled on a d8).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Target makes a melee basic attack against a random creature adjacent to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Target is stunned for a turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Target is slowed (save ends).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Target takes an extra 10 damage of a random elemental type rolled on a d10.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Target is exposed to chaos phage, and if it was dazed by the slad it becomes
stunned instead (save ends).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When the slaad is first bloodied it suffers an <strong>Amniotic Transformation</strong> and
becomes an ooze. It becomes unable to teleport and its speed drops to 4, but it
gains a <strong>Corrosive Pseudopodia</strong> attack that can be used as an opportunity
action against any adjacent enemy who moves or makes an attack. It deals minor
acid damage and grabs the target on a hit. With a minor action, the slaad can
sustian all of its grabs, deal acid damage to the victims, and regain 5 HP per
grabbed victim. So the loss of speed isn’t that crippling, because the slaad now
<em>wants</em> people to get adjacent to it. And it still retains the use of its other
attacks!</p>

<h3 id="putrid-slaad">Putrid Slaad</h3>

<p>This is an undead slaad. While it’s most often created on purpose by powerful
necromancers, it can also arise naturally when a slaad dies in the Abyss. These
“natural” putrid slaads have a tendency to obey demon lords, so you bet Orcus
loves them.</p>

<p>The putrid slaad loses its ability to spread chaos phage, but it still fights
very similarly to a living one. It will even eat its victims. The remains rot
inside its non-functional guts, and then the monster vomits them when it attacks
its <em>next</em> victims.</p>

<p>Putrid Slaads are Large Elemental Animates (Undead), and Level 19 Brutes with
227 HP. Its basic <strong>Claw</strong> attack pulls the target 1 square, and <strong>Graping
Claws</strong> allows it to make 2 of those with a single action. If both attacks hit,
the slaad grabs the victim.</p>

<p>Once the putrid slaad has grabbed someone, it will hit them with its <strong>Horrific
Spew</strong> (recharge 6), which deals both immediate and ongoing acid and necrotic
damage (save ends). The spew can also be used as a Close Blast 3 attack, but it
has a +2 to-hit bonus when focused on the grabbed victim.</p>

<p>The slaad can also <strong>cast aside</strong> its grabbed victim, pushing them 5 squares,
dealing some automatic physical damage to the victim, and using it to make an
area attack against anyone adjacent to the victim when it lands.</p>

<h2 id="personal-impressions">Personal Impressions</h2>

<p>More slaads. As far as late-edition slaads go, these are pretty cool
mechanically. Golden Slaads finally deliver the promised dose of pure chaos
people expect when they first read the slaad’s basic lore, and putrid slaads
have this cool cycle of grabbing people and tossing them aside, with an
occasional dose of disgusting barf.</p>
