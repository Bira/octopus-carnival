<p>I started a Let’s Read of Hell’s Rebels way back when it was new, in 2017. I had
gotten the campaign’s first three volumes with alongside a huge pile of other
Pathfinder PDFs in one of Humble Bundle’s offerings.</p>

<p>I managed to publish articles about the first three of those books here, though
I kinda stalled out between volumes 2 and 3. I still want to “Let’s Read” the
rest one day.</p>

<p>This post, and the series it starts, are about something a bit different. You
see, ever since I got those books I also had a desire to <em>run</em> this campaign,
but I didn’t want to do so using Pathfinder 1e’s default system. No, I wanted,
and still want, to use the Dungeon Fantasy RPG for it.</p>

<p>I actually did it, too! This was during the thick of the pandemic here in
Brazil, so I ran it on Roll20 with a group of friends. We got through the first
two adventures, but I ended up stopping that campaign because the combined
workload became a bit too heavy for me. I had to convert everything, prepare
battle maps and tokens for Roll20, adjudicate setting developments in response
to PC actions, and do all of that on time for the next session in two weeks
while juggling all the other stress sources those interesting times produced for
me and my family.</p>

<p>I still wanted to go through the whole thing, whether as a GM or as a player. As
a GM, I no longer had any confidence I could prepare everything I needed on
schedule. As a player, I had that peculiar problem where the only person I knew
who wanted to run that adventure in the exact way I wanted to play it was
me. Clearly, there was only one solution.</p>

<h2 id="running-this-thing-as-a-solo-campaign">Running this thing as a solo campaign</h2>

<p>I actually decided to run Hell’s Rebels for myself as a solo campaign way back
at the beginning of 2023, but it took until the start of June for me to finally
find the inspiration I was lacking.</p>

<p>This won’t be my first “solo” campaign: I ran through the first two Zeitgeist
adventures that way between 2015 and 2017, give or take a year. That attempt
lost steam due to the issues I’m about to discuss, but it was pretty fun while
it lasted.</p>

<p>My solo campaign attempts don’t have much in common with others I’ve seen
online. Those games tend to be quite minimalistic, with a single protagonist run
by the solo player, a setting sketched in broad strokes, and some sort of
“divination engine” taking the place of the GM. There is no pre-defined plot at
all - it’s entirely decided by asking questions to the engine and interpreting
its answers. The protagonist might have a starting goal, but how hard that is to
reach and what happens on the way are determined randomly. Note-taking seems
pretty minimal, unless the player in question wants to post actual play reports
online.</p>

<p>To be clear, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that approach and it is in
fact the one I would recommend to most people who want to do a solo game. All of
the solo game products out there support it, and it is excellent at replicating
the experience of being a player in a game and not knowing what will happen
next.</p>

<p>It’s also not the approach I’m going to use for myself. I guess I’m built
different.</p>

<p>The biggest difference between this game and one using the “best practice”
approach outlined above is that I have a pre-defined module I want to run: the
Hell’s Rebels Adventure Path. Not only do I want to play that, I’ve already read
the first four volumes quite closely. While I find it easy to “forget” this
stuff when I’m just a player, here I’m also the GM, which makes separating this
knowledge impossible.</p>

<p>And of course, I have this weird desire to run it in a way that mirrors a
standard party-based campaign with multiple players as closely as possible. I
want a <em>party</em> of heroes, and I want to be both player and GM at the same
time. I want it to be GURPS, and I want to interact with the mechanical widgets
of that system because I find them fun.</p>

<p>And of course, I don’t want to just keep a minimal set of notes. I’m not gonna
write things as a novel or anything, but I kinda want to see the game’s events
rendered as a reasonably comprehensive actual play report of the sort I see in
the <a href="https://dungeonfantastic.blogspot.com/">Dungeon Fantastic</a> blog. I’d do that even if I <em>didn’t</em> intend to post
them publicly - it’s what I did for Zeitgeist.</p>

<h3 id="how-im-doing-this">How I’m doing this</h3>

<p>My strange preferences bring two big risks to this endeavor.</p>

<p>The first one is the lack of an “information barrier” between player and
GM. This barrier and the dramatic tension it brings do not exist when player and
GM are the same person. The usual strategies for separating in-character
knowledge from out-of-character information do not work here, at least for
me. This gives me the strange simultaneous feeling that I’m “cheating” (as a
player) and “going too easy on the PCs” (as a GM). This is obviously an obstacle
to fun.</p>

<p>The other issue is with preparing maps and tokens. Sure, this would be much
easier on me if I ran everything in the theater of the mind, but I like moving
figures around on a battle map. The problem on my earlier attempts was that I
would usually leave the <em>building</em> of those battle maps to the very last second,
when I’d be in a rush to get on with the action. This also means I never took
the necessary time to familiarize myself with the software I was using. So I’d
stall, and procrastinate, and take two months to finish something that could
have been done in a couple of days.</p>

<p>To solve both of these issues, I’m going to make a resolution to never wear the
GM and player hats at the same time. The GM hat is for preparation. The player
hat is for “actual play”.</p>

<h3 id="the-gm-hat">The GM Hat</h3>

<p>During preparation, I’m going to consider myself a mix of GM and designer and
I’m going to lean on my newly-discovered feelings of Miniature Envy. You see, a
lot of the online friends I’ve made in the past year and a half are very much
into tabletop wargaming. They have extensive miniature collections and extremely
well-organized workspaces for assembling and painting them. They often post the
results of their work online and it always looks awesome.</p>

<p>I have neither the space, skill, nor the budget to do the same thing, but I
<em>can</em> look at the process of building battle maps and actor tokens in GCS,
TokenTool and Foundry with the same sort of perspective. Learning how to use the
software and actually building the things, then, becomes a hobby in itself. And
there’s no time or schedule pressure, so there’s no problem if I take a bit
longer in this part.</p>

<p>This will also be when I actually convert enemy stats, tests, and treasure from
the adventure’s original Pathfinder 1e to GURPS Dungeon Fantasy. I’ll try to
make them useful to others who want to try running the adventure in a more
traditional manner, but I won’t bother converting rules material for those paths
my PCs never take.</p>

<p>I will also perform some significant “condensation” in the campaign. Like all
Pathfinder adventure paths, Hell’s Rebels includes a lot of filler fights
placed to give your PCs enough XP for them to hit the expected character levels
at the right times. It also features lots of elements that get added only on
later books but which could be relevant from the start. Neither of these things
are necessary in a Dungeon Fantasy campaign where the PCs already start out
powerful and advance in a completely different manner.</p>

<p>As soon as I have a large enough chunk of unplayed material, I’m going to take
off my GM hat and become a player.</p>

<h3 id="the-player-hat">The Player Hat</h3>

<p>To solve the information barrier issue, I’m going to just learn to stop worrying
and love the cheese. When I’m wearing my player hat, it will be like I’m playing
a computer game with a walkthrough open. Sure, I might know what’s coming, and I
might even have a party custom-tailored to overcome those challenges, but the
<em>process</em> of overcoming those challenges can still be quite fun. It can even
still be surprising, depending on what the dice tell me.</p>

<p>It helps that this is the campaign whose main goal is punching fantasy
Nazis. Even if I know what’s coming, the actual process of going through it can
still be fun. Let us make awesome heroes tailored to the challenge and
completely stomp those fascist fuckers into the fucking ground! Let’s kick their
asses all the way to the Hell they came from! I want catharsis, dangit!</p>

<p>I will also try to pay special attention to my characters’ disadvantages and
other traits, and obey the dictates of those self-control rolls. And when some
kind of question appears during the “actual play” part, I’m going to use
the Mythic GM Emulator to answer it.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-this-for-you">What’s in this for you?</h2>

<p>This effort is going to generate a lot of material for this blog! I expect
readers will get some use out of my premade PCs, and out of the enemy stat
blocks I generate. Everything from those stats to the “actual play” reports and
design commentary is going to be published here.</p>

          <a href="/octopus-carnival/2023/07/07/neverwinter-absov-encounters.html">Let&#39;s Read Neverwinter: Abolethic Sovereignity Encounters</a>
        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The table of standard monsters that make up the AbSov’s roster includes pretty
much every heroic-tier aberrant creature, from Fell Taints (MM2) to the weaker
varieties of Mooncalf (Threats to the Nentir Vale). It also includes Heroic-Tier
versions of iconic aberrants usually found in Paragon, and non-aberrant
creatures and humanoids that can act as covert agents or as the basis for
mutated monstrosities with the Plaguechanged Monster theme described here.</p>

<p>We’ll take a look at the new monsters, NPCs, and at the template here.</p>

<h2 id="aboleth-opener">Aboleth Opener</h2>

<p>This is an aboleth specializing in brute-force psychic intrusion, “opening the
mind” of its victims using mental attacks and then dominating them for transport
to the underground base, where they will become test subjects. It’s a Large
Aberrant Magical Beast and a Level 7 Controller with 82 HP and the Aquatic
keyword. It has darkvision, a ground speed of 5, and a swim speed of 7.</p>

<p>The Opener projects an <strong>Eroding Mucus Haze</strong>, an aura (5) that is difficult
terrain for enemies and deals 5 psychic damage to any dazed enemy that starts
their turn inside. It can fight in melee with its <strong>Flaying Tentacles</strong>, which
do immediate and ongoing damage, but it prefers to stick to mental attacks if
possible in order to avoid damaging the goods.</p>

<p>The creature’s title comes from its <strong>Mental Lance</strong> ranged attack, which deals
psychic damage and dazes for a turn. It can then target dazed targets with
<strong>Enslaved Open Mind</strong>, a minor action power that dominates the target (save
ends). This recharges whenever the Opener has no dominated victims.</p>

<h2 id="aboleth-remnant">Aboleth Remnant</h2>

<p>Not even the aboleths themselves are immune to Spellplague corruption. Exposure
tends to turn them into these Remnants, whose body constantly spawns and sheds
tentacles and other limbs, and whose mind is in tatters. Remnants can fly,
unlike typical aboleths. They’re treated like the rest of the base’s “trash”,
and sent up the chasm to harass Neverwinter.</p>

<p>These wretches are Large Aberrant Magical Beasts and Level 5 Brutes with 78 HP
and the Aquatic keyword. They have darkvision, a ground speed of 5, a flight
speed of 7 (hover) and a swim speed of 10. They project an aura (2) of
<strong>Maddening Mucus</strong>, which acts as difficult terrain for enemies and makes them
grant combat advantage while inside.</p>

<p>Their attacks are a Reach 2 <strong>Telescoping Tentacle</strong> that damages and knocks
prone on a hit, and a <strong>Tentacle Flurry</strong> that targets enemies in a Close Burst
2, damaging and dazing them on a hit (save ends). A miss here deals half
damage. This recharges when the creature is first bloodied.</p>

<h2 id="grell-strangler">Grell Strangler</h2>

<p>This less-venomous variety of Grell is fond of strangling its victims. It’s a
Medium Aberrant Magical Beast with the Blind keyword. It has Blindsight 12, a
ground speed of 1, and a flight speed of 6 (hover).</p>

<p>Its basic attack is a Reach 2 <strong>Tentacle Lash</strong> that deals physical damage and
forces the target to grant combat advantage for a turn. That last one seems to
be a poison effect.</p>

<p>If the strangler isn’t grabbing anyone at the moment, it can use <strong>Grasping
Tentacles</strong> to remedy the situation. This Reach 2 attack does a bit of physical
damage and grabs the target (escape DC 16). The grell can immediately shift 1
square and pull the victim up to 2 squares, and while the grab persists the
victim takes 5 ongoing damage.</p>

<p>Once the strangler grabs someone, it will use <strong>Haul Away</strong> to do exactly
that. This move action lets it shift half its speed and drag a victim along with
it.</p>

<p>These are great for separating the party and messing up their
formations. Defenders and controllers should focus on locking them down to
prevent that.</p>

<h2 id="nothic-plagegazer">Nothic Plagegazer</h2>

<p>This monster is entirely made by the chaotic magic of the Spellplague
pocket. Its gaze can inflict a debilitating spell sickness on its victims.</p>

<p>Plaguegazers are Medium Aberrant Humanoids and Level 6 Artillery with 60
HP. They have a speed of 6, darkvision, and truesight 10. They exude an <strong>Oozing
Plague</strong> from their skin that causes any creature that ends their turn adjacent
to the nothic to take ongoing 5 poison damage (save ends).</p>

<p>The nothic prefers to keep away from enemies and attack them with its
<strong>Sickening Gaze</strong>, which deals necrotic damage, ongoing 5 poison damage, and
slows (save ends both). After the first failed save, the Slowed condition
worsens to Immobilized.</p>

<p>It can also use an area attack named <strong>Spread the Infection</strong>. This targets a
creature taking ongoing poison damage, and affects an Area Burst 1 centered on
them. It deals necrotic damage and inflicts ongoing 10 poison damage (save ends)
on those it hits. On a miss, it still inflicts half its immediate and ongoing
damage. It recharges when the nothic is bloodied.</p>

<p>If it has no other choices, it will use its <strong>claws</strong> in melee. They have no
riders, but Oozing Plague will probably be in effect here.</p>

<h2 id="nothic-mindwarp">Nothic Mindwarp</h2>

<p>Another nothic produced by the plague pocket. It’s more insane than usual, and
likes to caper and cackle about as it drives others mad with its gaze. It’s a
Level 3 Lurker with 42 HP and a Speed of 6.</p>

<p>The mindwarp will try to affect someone with its <strong>Warping Gaze</strong>, a ranged
attack that deals psychic damage and forces the target to grant CA (save
ends). While the target is affected by this condition, the nothic becomes
invisible to everyone but the target, and its basic <strong>claw</strong> attack does 1d6
extra damage. On a miss, the nothic still has partial concealment for a
turn. The power recharges when the victim saves against it.</p>

<p>So the tactic here is to use Warping Gaze on someone, and then try to attack
<em>someone else</em> with enhanced claw attacks, repeating the procedure when the
gaze’s victim saves against it.</p>

<p>If the nothic gets surrounded, it can use its <strong>Forbidding Glare</strong> encounter
power to attack enemies in a Close Burst 2, dealing psychic damage and pushing
them 2 squares on a hit.</p>

<h2 id="plaguechanged-monster-theme">Plaguechanged Monster Theme</h2>

<p>A monster <em>theme</em> modifies a monster in a less drastic way than a monster
<em>template</em>. Templates turn a regular into an elite or an elite into a
solo. Themes add a couple of flavorful powers without changing the monster’s
level or “quality”. They’re a great way to really tie a dungeon together, even
if the base creatures are very disparate otherwise.</p>

<p>Plaguechanged monsters are affected by the Spellplague. They show the scars or
mutations associated with it, and possess magic abilities that use its
characteristic blue flames and corruptive effects.</p>

<p>I was mistaken before - plaguechanged monsters do <em>not</em> gain the ability to
sense spellscarred PCs, nor do they suffer defense penalties against these
PCs. To create one, you just add one attack and one utility power to the base
creature from the sets provided here.</p>

<p>Attack powers include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blue Fire Burst</strong>: Encounter, triggers when first bloodied. Close burst 2
vs. Reflex, deals fire and force damage, pushes 2 squares.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inferno Step</strong>: Teleport 5 squares and attack a Close Burst 1 on
arrival. This deals fire damage and knocks prone on a hit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Scouring Lash</strong>: At-will reach 2 melee attack, deals fire and force damage
and slides 1 square on a hit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Unraveling Touch</strong> Encounter reach 1 melee attack, deals necrotic damage and
dazes (save ends).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The attack and damage from all of these are expressed in terms of the base
creature’s level, so they can be applied to any monster from any book - even
minions, as the DMG2 has rules for applying themes to them.</p>

<p>Utility powers include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Burning Gaze</strong> Encounter, minor action. Invisible or otherwise hidden
enemies within 5 squares of the creature glow with blue flame, losing the
benefits from cover and concealment and granting combat advantage until the
end of the creature’s next turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Devourer of Flame</strong>: Encounter, triggers in reaction to taking fire
damage. The creature gains temporary HP equal to half the fire damage, and a
+4 bonus do damage rolls until the end of its next turn.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wings of Blue Fire</strong>: Encounter, move action. The creature flies its speed,
and anyone making opportunity attacks against it during this movement takes
fire damage equal to the creature’s level.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rohini-the-prophet-of-helms-hold">Rohini, The Prophet of Helm’s Hold</h2>

<p>Here we have a surprise NPC big-shot belonging to the AbSov faction. Rohini is
the person in charge of Helm’s Hold, which as we saw before has been converted
into a hospital for Spellplague victims and has a Realms-wide good reputation
for its humanitarian efforts. This is where we learn that the Hold is a front
for the Abolethic Sovereignity, and Rohini is their agent. There was already
some mention of it in the New Neverwinter section, but this one gives us the
full details.</p>

<p>The Prophet of Helm’s Hold presents herself as an attractive and charismatic
female human, but she’s something fair weirder. Not long ago, she was a succubus
summoned by the Ashmadai and tasked with infiltrating the spellscarred treatment
center in Neverwinter’s House of Knowledge. There, a priest corrupted by the
Sovereignity exposed her to an artifact named the Hex Locus, a solidified chunk
of Spellplague magic. This warped the devil and infused her with the same
essence that turns humans into foulspawn.</p>

<p>Rohini’s main mission is to safeguard the Locus, which she moved to Helm’s
Hold. Her secondary goal is to collect new Choir candidates from among the
Hold’s patients and send them to the underground base. She is called the Prophet
because she makes statements about future events that tend to come true (due to
AbSov meddling). Her healing blessings are entirely fake, and make patients feel
good just as their condition steadily worsens.</p>

<p>Rohini has stats very similar to a <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2019/12/15/succubus.html">standard succubus</a>, making her a Level 9
Controller. There are some important differences, though. She’s Aberrant instead
of Immortal. Her basic Corrupting Touch is upgraded to a <strong>Maddening Touch</strong>
that does psychic damage and slides 2 squares. Her Charming Kiss turns into a
<strong>Soul-Wrenching Kiss</strong> that places more restrictions upon the victim.</p>

<p>As before, the victim of the kiss is unable to attack the succubus, but they
also can’t willingly move away from her, closing the main loophole in the basic
succubus’ power. They also take 10 ongoing fire and psychic damage while under
the effect of the kiss. All of this is a (save ends) package, and it also ends
when Rohini attacks the victim or uses the kiss on someone else.</p>

<p>Her Loyal Consort power is upgraded to <strong>Mind-Warped Bodyguard</strong>. Now it works
as long as the victim of the Kiss is within 5 squares of Rohini, and lets them
teleport to switch places before redirecting attacks to the victim.</p>

<h2 id="chartilifax">Chartilifax</h2>

<p>This complicated name belongs to a <a href="https://bira.github.io/octopus-carnival/2020/01/16/green-dragon.html">young green dragon</a> who used to inhabit
the Neverwinter Wood, and which Rohini managed to seduce and
subvert. Experiments performed by the AbSov’s foulspawn sorcerers have given him
the ability to transform into a Medium humanoid like his master, and the
Devourer of Flame power from the Plaguechanged theme.</p>

<p>Chartilifax spends most of his days in the shape of a green-skinned elf in the
basements under Helm’s Hold, performing menial tasks. He’s also pretty close to
Rohini’s seat of power, so he’s gonna be there as a nasty surprise when the PCs
manage to corner her.</p>

          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As mentioned before, one of the things the Spellplague did a century ago was to
bring parts of the world of Abeir into Toril, and vice-versa. These transplanted
chunks of geography also brought whoever happened to be living on them. And one
of these whoevers was the Abolethic Sovereignity, a kingdom ruled by these
aberrant creatures.</p>

<p>Shortly after arriving, the Sovereignity built a flying citadel named Xxiphu to
act as their headquarters. Interested in studying the phenomenon that isekaied
them, the aboleths started searching for pockets of the chaotic magic that makes
up the Spellplague and sending in research teams to investigate them.</p>

<p>One of the pockets they found was in the Underdark beneath Neverwinter. A branch
of the Sovereignity built a permanent base around it and have been studying it
for the past few decades, occasionally kidnapping people from the surface to
serve as test subjects.</p>

<p>When the eruption happened, it opened a chasm on the surface that went all the
way down to the aboleth base, potentially exposing it to curious delvers from
the surface. Moving the base was not an option, so they instead fortified it and
began sending the results of their early experiments up the chasm as a way to
discourage explorers. This worked for a long time, since the city was a mess.</p>

<p>When Neverember arrived and began rebuilding, the aboleths felt threatened and
began taking more active steps to divert the lord’s attention elsewhere and to
infiltrate his organization.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>After a century of research the aboleths have a pretty good handle on the
properties of the Spellplague, and they have a planned use for it.</p>

<p>You see, they know where Maegera is. Their entry in the book off-handedly
remarks that it was a brief awakening of the primordial that caused that
city-destroying eruption. The AbSov’s ultimate plan is to expose the primordial
to the Spellplague, using the techniques they developed to then dominate her
mind or control her in some other fashion. With a genuine primordial under their
command, the Sovereignity has a real shot at taking over the whole world.</p>

<p>In the meantime, they’re using that expertise on a steady stream of victims
brought from the surface by their agents. These unfortunates are exposed to the
Spellplague in a controlled manner. Those who fail to display the proper
strength of mind and soul after initial exposure to the Plague become the
monsters regularly released upon the surface. Those who pass this test are then
subject to a very specific series of tortures and procedures that turn them into
near-mindless members of the Choir that sings the Symphony of Madness.</p>

<p>This Symphony can channel the chaotic energies of the Spellplague in ways that
the aboleths can control, and it’s what they use to mutate their kidnapped
victims. They also use it to broadcast nightmares all over the region, which
afflict its more psychically sensitive individuals. The stronger it gets the
more people are affected. This could eventually be the tool they use to tame
Maegera, or could lead to the development of that tool depending on the GM’s
designs.</p>

<h2 id="player-tie-ins">Player Tie-Ins</h2>

<p>The nightmares mentioned in the descriptions of Oghma’s Faithful and the
Spellscarred Harbinger come from the Symphony of Madness. The latter in
particular has very strong thematic ties to the AbSov - their starting hook
sends the PC right into their clutches, as we’ll see soon.</p>

<p>If the GM decides to make the AbSov a major antagonist in the campaign, then the
Symphony’s nightmares will likely begin affecting more and more people. Its
effects are not set in stone, but the book gives various suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They might make victims irritable and violent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They might drain healing surges after a long rest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They might impost long-lasting penalties from lack of sleep or psychological
trauma.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They might provide hints about where to find their source.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Stepping up the frequency or severity of these effects over the course of the
campaign will provide a very strong incentive for PCs to find the source of
these dreams and shut it down, leading to a big confrontation against the AbSov
in their home base.</p>

<p>One way the PCs might protect themselves from the nightmares is to buy these
creepy little dolls sold by Helm’s Hold. If you place one of these Dreamthief
Dolls under your pillow at night, you won’t experience the nightmares. Rumor has
it that the dolls send the nightmares they catch to the Hold’s patients, but
Rohini, who runs the hospice at the Hold, says they’re just imbued with minor
protective blessings (she’s lying; the rumors are true).</p>

<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>

<p>We already know the AbSov is busily infiltrating New Neverwinter. Here we also
learn that they sort of disdain the Ashmadai, because all of the cult’s attempts
to infiltrate them have only fed them more converts (including Rohini). They are
however more circumspect when dealing with the Thayans or the Netherese, because
they fear the powerful magic those factions might be able to bring to bear if
they call on their far-away epic bosses.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>This is a comparatively huge entry with an extensive encounters section, as
we’ll see in the next post. This leads me to think the Aboleths are intended to
be one of the campaign’s top antagonists. A campaign where you start opposing
(or even working for) New Neverwinter and uncover the aboleth conspiracy seems
to be an easy one to make with the book’s default setup.</p>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>New Neverwinter’s hired goons can be represented by a variety of statblocks for
characters or usually-playable ancestries extracted from the Monster Manual 2,
Monster Vault, and Threats to the Nentir Vale. There’s a table here with entries
ranging from level 1 to level 8. It includes a Doppelganger Sneak, every stat
block from the [River Rats][1] entry in Threats plus a smattering of humans,
gnomes, half-elves and dragonborn.</p>

<p>We also get detailed writeups for Neverember himself and for Soman Galt, and
some information on General Sabine, the faction’s third big shot.</p>

<h2 id="dagult-neverember">Dagult Neverember</h2>

<p>As written, Neverember is a somewhat complex villain by D&amp;D standards. He’s
ruthless, greedy, arrogant and imperialistic, but he is not evil-aligned. His
preferred way of lining his own pockets also tends to be beneficial to his trade
partners, and he is sincere in his desire to improve the lives of his subjects
even if it’s only so they’ll crown him king. He also behaves like a typical
mercantilist aristocrat, which includes a dose of sexism. He treats “intelligent
male acquaintances” with respect but “flirts outrageously” with “beautiful
female guests”. I strongly suggests removing these traits from his personality
if you want him to come off as sympathetic to your players.</p>

<p>If the PCs can stomach his horrible personality, he might end up allied with
them against a greater threat, even if only because that greater threat would be
worse for the region than him.</p>

<p>If he dies, it will cause a lot of chaos in the city, because like it or not
he’s one of the region’s current stabilizing forces. The Thayans, Netherese, and
the rebels would immediately feel emboldened by the chaos, and the rebels in
particular will immediately turn on anyone who tries to take leadership of the
city for themselves (because <em>they</em> want it). If no one else manages to take
over, General Sabine will do it and turn the city into a brutal militarized
police state. So I guess the PCs should make sure the region is set up to remain
stable after his demise before facing the guy.</p>

<p>Neverember is a Level 7 Soldier with 84 HP. Yes, he’s a regular, which means he
will have <em>plenty</em> of bodyguards with him. He’s armed with a <strong>Longsword</strong> whose
basic attacks inflict a -2 penalty to hit for a turn, and if an adjacent enemy
shifts or targets someone other than him with an attack, he can use <strong>Lord’s
Rebuke</strong> to make a free basic attack against them. He can also <strong>Taunt</strong>
(recharge 4+), an attack vs. Will that targets one enemy and on a hit pulls them
4 squares and makes them grant combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<h2 id="general-sabine">General Sabine</h2>

<p>General Sabine doesn’t get a section of her own, but I’m collecting and
repeating the scattered information we get about her here. She’s the commander
of the mercenary company Lord Neverember hired to act as his army and police
force.</p>

<p>The reason he’s using mercenaries is because using his house troops from
Waterdeep would make the whole situation look too much like an invasion and
occupation by a foreign power. Sabine, however, is perfectly able and willing to
command her army like the foreign invasion and occupation force it is. There’s
not to much nuance to her character - she’s an uncomplicated brutal
authoritarian. She uses the stats for the Human Cavalier from the MM2, making
her a Level 7 Soldier (Leader).</p>

<p>I imagine there are lots of complaints about the police brutality inflicted on
the citizenry of Neverwinter by the mercenaries, though I guess Neverember
manages to keep them at just below the level where he’d care. If Neverember dies
suddenly, General Sabine is the most likely character to replace him in the
internal power struggle that will follow, and she will turn the city into a
violent police state.</p>

<p>Mordai Vell, one of the leaders of the Ashmadai, is trying to recruit Sabine for
the cult. As of the campaign’s start, he hasn’t succeeded yet - whether he will
or not depends on the wishes of the GM and the events that happen in play.</p>

<h2 id="soman-galt">Soman Galt</h2>

<p>The acting mayor of Neverwinter gained his position because of his previous
career as a government official. He’s more than a bit scatterbrained but is
capable of taking his job seriously and performing it competently.</p>

<p>Neverember thinks of Galt as a useful puppet, and he’s right. However, he’s
<em>someone else’s</em> puppet. Rohini, the Prophet of Helm’s Hold, got a hold of the
dwarf and turned him into an asset of the Abolethic Sovereignity quite some time
ago. As the campaign starts, Galt is under an incredible number of
aboleth-crafted post-hypnotic suggestions, and regularly visits Helm’s Hold to
receive more. This has him looking less and less healthy as time goes by.</p>

<p>It also means the aboleths are effectively in control of the city’s civil and
social policies, and know everything that happens on it. They know which spots
on the city wall are less defended, and send their monsters there. They’re going
to have an incredible edge when they decide to really invade the surface.</p>

<p>Galt <em>doesn’t actually know</em> any of this, and would probably go insane from
trauma and guilt if he learned it. In emergencies, one of the aboleths below can
assume direct control of him, switching his alignment from Unaligned to Chaotic
Evil and giving him access to extra powers. Once he becomes bloodied, that
control becomes stronger and he begins moving as if he was having a seizure.</p>

<p>Galt is a Level 6 Controller with 74 HP. His typical dwarven speed of 5
increases to 7 when he’s bloodied. Being bloodied also activates his aura (5) of
<strong>Dissonant Gibberish</strong>, which inflicts Vulnerable 5 Psychic and a -2 penalty to
saves on all enemies inside.</p>

<p>Galt’s basic attack is a <strong>Whipping Warhammer</strong> that damages and slides the
target 1 square. He can <strong>Transmute the Unwilling</strong> as a ranged attack, dealing
psychic damage and slowing (save ends). Even on a miss this still slows for a
turn. Once per encounter he can <strong>Weave Nightmares</strong> in a Close Burst 2,
targeting all enemies, dealing heavy psychic damage and dazing (save ends). Also
once per encounter he can <strong>Twist Space</strong> to teleport 3 squares. If he chooses
to appear in an enemy’s space with this, they swap positions and the enemy
grants combat advantage for a turn.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>I think Galt is our most pleasant surprise here, in terms of both his lore and
his mechanics. As for the other two, Sabine is more dangerous than Dagult if you
give her a mount and fix the damage on her MM2 stat block. I think this makes
sense, both in-setting and narratively. She’s kind of his Dragon, in TVTropes
parlance.</p>

        </h1>

        <article class="post" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
          <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>As mentioned before, Lord Dagult Neverember of Waterdeep has recently arrived in
Neverwinter at the head of a mercenary force with the intent of rebuilding the
city and re-establishing order and trade. He claims descent from one of Nasher
Alagondar’s bastard sons, saying this gives him the right to take over the
city. Alagondar was the ruler of Neverwinter at the time depicted in the
computer games.</p>

<p>“New Neverwinter” is a concept Neverember’s propaganda machine came up with to
stir nationalistic sentiment among the populace and get them on-side. This, and
the practical results of his rebuilding efforts, have worked on the majority of
the city’s residents, but some of them consider the idea of a “new Neverwinter”
to be an insult to the city’s memory. Chief among these dissenters are the Sons
of Alagondar, militant rebels who oppose Neverember and have been clashing often
with his forces.</p>

<p>Most of what we’ve seen so far points to Neverember being a villainous
character, whose claim is fake and whose rule would be selfish and
oppressive. But there’s a text box here that reminds us that not even this is
set in stone. Lord Neverember’s role in a specific campaign is entirely up to
the GM. His claim might be true or false, his intentions might be altruistic or
selfish, and his rule could end up being good or bad for the region, and all of
these “switches” are independent from each other. Also independent from all of
this is the attitude of the PCs towards him - you still have a meaty campaign
whether they want to support or topple the lord, and there are plenty of other
things to occupy them if they’re indifferent.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>Neverember’s main goal is of course to <strong>Claim the Throne</strong>. He is effectively
in charge of that portion of the city his faction controls, but running the city
and wearing its crown are very different things. Neverember’s current plan is to
make the people love him. He’s going to improve their lives so much that they’ll
beg him to become their lord, claim or no claim. Mwa-ha-ha!</p>

<p>Of course, Dagult will still have a much easier time of it if he can <strong>Prove his
Disputed Heritage</strong>. He knows his word is not enough to prove his claim, so he’s
been hiring scholars and explorers to look for documents that support it among
the city’s ruined archives and libraries. He’s also not above hiring those same
scholars to <em>fabricate</em> such documents, and has burned more than one book that
had a less-than-helpful stance on his ancestry.</p>

<p>While seeking the crown, Neverember still has to actually <strong>Run the City</strong>, to
<strong>Maintain His Position</strong> as the Open Lord of Waterdeep, and he also never loses
sight of the whole reason he’s doing all of this, which is to <strong>Make Hard
Coin</strong>. In order to juggle all of this, he delegates heavily. General Sabine,
who commands the mercenary army, is in charge of policing and defending the
territory he controls in the city. He appointed a dwarf named Soman Galt to act
as mayor and oversee tax collection, grants of property, and other paperwork.</p>

<p>For the same reason, he loves to <strong>Hire Sellswords</strong> to care care of problems
that require more discreet solutions. This includes looking for proof of his
claims and spying on the opposition as mentioned above, but it also includes
<strong>Finding Gauntlgrym</strong> because having that as a feather on his cap would
increase his chances of being declared king by popular acclaim.</p>

<h2 id="player-character-tie-ins">Player Character Tie-Ins</h2>

<p>A PC with the Neverwinter Noble background is Dagult’s greatest nightmare:
someone with a stronger claim to the throne of the city. He will either try to
deal with the obstacle by sending mercenaries to spy on or assassinate the
character, or by trying to publicly discredit them once the discreet approach
becomes impossible.</p>

<p>The Harper Agent was also sent here to oppose Neverember, but as the campaign
starts they’ve just realized nothing is as it seems. Are they proceeding with
their original mission, or deviating from it now that the Harpers’ original
intel proved to be woefully incomplete?</p>

<p>PCs with the Oghma’s Faithful theme would be eager to take part in any genuine
fact-finding expedition about Dagult’s lineage (or that of his
rivals!). However, their devotion is to the truth rather than to any mortal
lord, and the truth they find can end up drawing the ire of either Dagult
himself or his enemies, depending on whether it contradicts or supports his
claim.</p>

<p>Depending on his exact moral disposition in the campaign, Neverember could be
either a potential sponsor or a rival to the Heir of Delzoun in the search for
Gauntlgrym.</p>

<p>PCs without direct connections to this storyline might still find New
Neverwinter a ready source of miscellaneous mercenary jobs when they need some
extra cash and XP. In addition to being the hired swords for the above plots,
they could also bolster the faction’s efforts to evict the orcish army that has
taken part of the city ruins, or get hired to investigate the numerous
mysterious events in town that point to the other major factions, like
spellplagued monster attacks or mysterious disappearances.</p>

<h2 id="faction-relationships">Faction Relationships</h2>

<p>New Neverwinter has no idea the <strong>Abolethic Sovereignity</strong> is behind those
monster attacks. They’re causing these to keep the surfacers distracted while
they carry on their experiments.</p>

<p>The <strong>Ashmadai</strong> managed to secure a tenuous alliance of sorts with New
Neverwinter. Dagult doesn’t know who they are beyond “a shady but influential
cult”. He uses them as an occasional source of deniable muscle, and they’re hard
at work subverting and corrupting his underlings with the goal of eventually
inducting the man himself among their ranks. Their leader, Mordai Veil, is
currently attempting to seduce General Sabine.</p>

<p>He was received a few reports of <strong>Thayans</strong> in the region, and has tasked
General Sabine with finding out more. She has yet to deliver her first report.</p>

<p>Dagult is completely ignorant of <strong>Netherese</strong> operations in the region and has
unwittingly hired Shadovar agents as assassins before.</p>

<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>

<p>Even if you decide to make the lord himself something other than a villainous
asshole, there are a lot of events in motion that could lead him and his faction
in that direction. They’re heavily infiltrated by both diabolists and abolethic
agents! PCs seeking to support or co-opt New Neverwinter are going to have a
harder job ahead of them than those who try to destroy it. They’re also in the
dark about the Thayans and Netherese as the campaign starts, and might be
blindsided by either of them.</p>

<p>I still think Dagult and friends work better as villains, either by themselves
or as an eventual tool of someone worse. Making them neutral or sympathetic
would however be a good way to take New Neverwinter out of consideration if the
party is not interested in tangling with it, making it a part of the background
noise.</p>
